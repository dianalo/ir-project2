IbrahimStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/22/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTPETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><DATELINE> GENEVA, Switzerland  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has launched its most plausible bid in several years to regain control of world oil markets and drive prices up.    The test of OPEC's new strategy will come in February, when the organization attempts to defy the market and return to a fixed price averaging $18 a barrel for oil based on production cuts pledged by 12 of its 13 members in the meantime. Iraq, alone among OPEC members, refused to go along with the accord.    If this fundamental reversal of OPEC's recent strategies succeeds -- and many industry experts remain skeptical -- it offers price relief to a battered oil industry in the U.S. and world-wide. Banks and nations with major loans to oil-exporting nations also would welcome the relief. But one effect of the accord could be a resurgence of inflation, especially in Europe, where the combination of lower oil prices and a declining dollar have begun to stimulate long-stalled economies.    After ten days of haggling, crowned by a marathon, all-night session, OPEC arrived at the decision to cut the group's oil production to about 16 million barrels a day, and, starting Feb. 1, to substitute the $18 price for market forces.    The agreement was cemented by a formidable political alliance within OPEC between radicals and moderates.    For the first time in years, Iran and Saudi Arabia teamed up to drive the organization toward its decision. Building on a relationship that has developed steadily since before the dismissal in October of Ahmed Zaki Yamani as Saudi oil minister, the Saudis' acting minister, Hisham Nazer, worked closely with Iran's representative, Gholamreza Agazadeh, to bring about the accord.    Adopting what many oil ministers called the most ambitious challenge in OPEC's 26-year history, the group put into motion measures to lower all members' production about 7% each starting in January.    A more dramatic action was the decision, which was not anticipated, to phase out by the end of January, all oil sales contracts that are based on a free-market pricing of oil in favor of the fixed-price structure. To do so, OPEC supplied member countries with a list of prices to charge for their oil exports starting Feb. 1.    OPEC's conference president, Nigerian oil minister Rilwanu Lukman, who appeared exhausted at a dawn news conference following a long negotiating session, said the group's ambitious commitment to push oil prices up will be &quot;supported by further cuts in production if needed&quot; to reach the $18 target.    If implemented diligently, the decisions are expected to change the tenor of world oil markets significantly in the first quarter. A direct result of this accord, Mr. Lukman and other ministers said, is the dismantling of the so-called netback agreement.    This method of selling oil, adopted by nearly all OPEC members, shifts the risks of price fluctuations to producers by basing the price of their crude oil on what it will fetch in the market after it is refined into products. Many companies, already hurt by the drop in oil prices, consider netbacks a mandatory protection against further losses.    If Iraq had agreed to participate in the accord -- accepting a production quota of 1,466,000 barrels a day -- the group's overall limit on output would have come down further, to 15.8 million barrels a day. But because Iraq is producing 200,000 barrels a day above its theoretical quota, its exclusion wasn't expected to have a major impact in the next few months.    A major duel between OPEC producers and oil buyers is certain to unfold as oil companies resist breaking their netback contracts and imposition of a new fixed price.    OPEC's output could plunge much deeper than its planned 16 million barrels a day, as buyers seek lower prices from non-OPEC oil producers. OPEC ministers warned that Mexico, Egypt, Norway, the Soviet Union and other producers that don't belong to the group shouldn't take advantage. If they did, Mr. Lukman said, they would weaken oil prices for all producers.    Kuwait's oil minister, Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, echoed a widespread feeling of apprehension here when he said, &quot;Over the next month or so, the market will test the agreement very, very hard.&quot; But, Mr. al-Sabah also voiced the determination felt by the other members, adding, &quot;We shouldn't be frightened if the companies say, 'Sorry boys, we will not be picking up your crude.' They will come back soon enough.&quot;    OPEC's plan is based on a projection that demand for its oil in the next quarter will top 18 million barrels a day. Allowing for the large stores of oil currently held by oil companies, the group's experts think that if production is kept low until summer, reserves will have been drained and prices will be pushed up in a market starved for OPEC supplies.    OPEC is counting on the fact that buyers have to weigh the risks of giving up purchasing arrangements in an environment of palpable determination by its members to make their new strategy stick.    Oil prices have risen nearly $2 a barrel, to a new average of $16 a barrel, on anticipation of an OPEC agreement before the weekend accord was announced.    Industry officials and analysts were split in their views of OPEC's chances for success. But there was widespread agreement that the organization was undertaking an ambitious quest to again become a coherent oil cartel. OPEC's gamble comes at the end of a disastrous year, which saw oil prices sink from highs around $28 a barrel last December to a low of $7 a barrel before settling in the $15-a-barrel range since August. Behind the price collapse was OPEC's experimentation with a now-discredited strategy of getting a bigger share of the market by launching a price war with other oil producers.    OPEC's main accomplishment here was its move to &quot;bury forever this price-war strategy,&quot; said Nordine Ait Laoussine, a former OPEC official who is now a Geneva-based consultant.    A first step in this direction was taken in the summer with a temporary agreement to suspend that policy for two months-an agreement that was extended to year-end after an acrimonious 17-day session last October.    With these new production and pricing decisions, OPEC seems to have come full-circle. Exactly a year ago, the organization was struggling to maintain a ceiling of 16 million barrels a day that was broken by nearly all of its members, sending oil prices sliding into chaos. The resulting loss of some $50 billion in revenue has been a bitter pill for OPEC. The experience, ministers said, has created new resolve to return to disciplined production. Mr. Lukman seemed to confirm this notion when he said, &quot;I wish (1986) didn't happen.&quot;    But many new problems will face OPEC as it attempts to implement the new accord.    A senior oil trader for a major oil company, asking not to be identified, said there were too many poor or small oil producers in the organization -- including Nigeria, Ecuador, Gabon, and Qatar -- that cannot stand the financial pressure that will result as oil companies attempt to crack their resolve.    &quot;You will only see $18 oil for a fleeting time in 1987,&quot; the senior executive said. &quot;There's too much oil out there and too little will power in here.&quot;    But the Saudi-Iranian resolve to drive prices higher cannot be underestimated.    During this ten-day meeting, the oil ministers of both countries worked together almost daily to eliminate obstacles. They had the strong support of Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, who also held talks by phone with Libya's leader, Moammar Gadhafi, and Algeria's president, Chadli BinJadid, in a fundamental realignment of forces inside OPEC.    Even before he dismissed Mr. Yamani, King Fahd had reached the conclusion that the price-war strategy was a disaster.    Ministerial sources here said Saudi Arabia, like all OPEC members, suffered from a drastic loss of revenue when prices collapsed. More ominously, it fell under increasingly belligerent pressure from Iran, whose militant Islamic regime has been on a political and military offensive since early 1986 in its seven-year war with Iraq and within OPEC's ranks.    In the summer, Iran began talks with King Fahd, promising to back away from attacks on Saudi, Kuwaiti and other Arab-owned oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and to diminish its sponsorship of militant anti-Saudi elements in the Gulf region. In return, it asked that Saudi Arabia bring an end to the oil-price war, which was starving Iran for oil revenue.    Algeria and Libya joined Iran in the quest to overturn Saudi Arabia's commitment to the price-war approach from the beginning. All three alternated between vicious propaganda assaults on the conservative Saudi kingdom and promises of better political relations.    Iranian, Arab and OPEC sources said the new agreement offers political benefits to all these major players in OPEC.    From Iran's point of view, it can only be pleased about its ability to create much tension between its enemy, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. By staying out of the production agreement and turning down an insistent request from King Fahd to cooperate, Iraq clearly has upset the Saudi monarch.    Sources here say this accounts for the Saudi &quot;discovery&quot; that &quot;technical problems&quot; in a pipeline that could carry some 500,000 barrels a day of Iraqi oil to the Red Sea port of Yanbu will delay its reopening until spring. Saudi Arabia had closed down the shared pipeline, known as Petroline, to expand it. But the work has been finished, and informed sources suggest that the delay in its reopening is a &quot;political decision&quot; taken in retaliation to Iraq's snub to King Fahd.    More significantly, Iran has succeeded in portraying Iraq's refusal to join the agreement as a Saudi problem. Iran agreed not to pursue a proposal to denounce Iraq and have its OPEC status reviewed if Iraq didn't join the agreement within a month. The move nearly wrecked the OPEC agreement on Friday until a compromise was worked out between Iraq and Saudi Arabia that the Saudis will &quot;deliver the Iraqis by summer,&quot; one ministerial source said.    This is important -- particularly in view of the fact that Iraq is expanding an existing pipeline to Turkey's Mediterranean port of Ceyhan to export 500,000 additional barrels a day by next summer. Iran argues that Saudi Arabia will feel obligated to somehow mitigate the impact of this new addition by cutting its own production or risk the collapse of the Saudi-Iranian plan to boost oil prices.    Finally, Saudi Arabia has found itself consorting with its once-bitter OPEC enemies -- Libya, Iran and Algeria. And it has shifted direction toward their longstanding demand for higher oil prices.    The three militant OPEC nations never accepted Saudi Arabia's price war, and continue to call for even higher prices. &quot;Why not $28 or $30 (a barrel),&quot; Algeria's oil minister, Belkacem Nabi, said Saturday in an interview.    The agreement also favors Saudi Arabia, representing a major political achievement for King Fahd.    Having fired Mr. Yamani, who became identified with the price-war strategy, and declared that he wanted a fixed $18 oil price based on equal sacrifice by all OPEC members, the king can boast that he did exactly what he set out to accomplish.    Iraq, although somewhat isolated by its refusal to join the accord, also has accomplished its main aim of opening the way for a much higher production quota when and if it decides to rejoin OPEC's efforts. By summer, the Iraqis should be able to export some 2.5 million barrels a day. &quot;This agreement is a major triumph for us,&quot; declared Qassem Taqi al-Urabi, Iraq's oil minister.    Iraqi sources doubt that their confrontation with Saudi Arabia will lead to a continued blocking of the pipeline to Yanbu. At any rate, Iraq continues to receive some 200,000 barrels a day in &quot;war-support&quot; crude free of charge from Saudi Arabia. It gets extensive logistical and financial aid from the Saudis as well. Many OPEC delegates calculated that if oil prices go high enough, Iraq eventually will agree to join the agreement.    How long this honeymoon among OPEC members will last is difficult to assess. At the moment, they are united by an almost religious fervor to boost oil revenue. Even a limited success of OPEC's price-boosting strategy would give the group the stamina to go on with its push until year's end, OPEC ministers say.    But the real test occurs between now and February as OPEC producers dismantle the entire structure of sales contracts to replace it with fixed prices.    ---                         OPEC Quotas   Current dail production quotas and new levels for the nexttwo quarters               (In millions of barrels a day)                                                    STARTING    COUNTRY                     DURING DEC.
