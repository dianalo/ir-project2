(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Trainees in the Navy's rescue swimmerschool plunged into the pool under less stringent demands as theprogram resumed for the first time since a recruit drowned lastMarch from ``sheer terror.''   The rescue swimmer school was closed March 29 because of thedeath four weeks earlier of Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, ofAppleton, Wis., who was allegedly forced back into a swimming poolafter he climbed out saying that he wanted to quit the course.   Officials have since revised the curriculum and eliminated thedrill being conducted at the time of Mirecki's death. The schoolreopened Monday and students, grunting and shouting encouragementto each other, went into the pool for the first time Tuesday.   ``They are a highly motivated group and they are prettyenthusiastic about getting started,'' said Lt. Cmdr. DennisHessler, public affairs officer for the Naval Education andTraining Command.   As a result of Mirecki's death, five instructors have beenaccused of involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commitbattery. The officer in charge of the school, Lt. Thomas A.Torchia, has been relieved and charged with dereliction of duty.All six may face court-martial.   The 22 Navy and two Coast Guard students will serve to validatethe new training regimen. No other classes will begin until theirfour weeks of training is completed, Hessler said.   The class is being monitored by experienced rescue swimmers andrepresentatives of the Naval Education and Training Command and theCoast Guard.   ``Basically they are watching to see how this curriculum works... and then to make any fine tuning or tweaking if necessary,''Hessler said.   After Mirecki was forced into the pool, one instructor allegedlyheld him under water in a head-hold used during a drill called``sharks and daisies'' just before he collapsed.   The drill, in which instructors grabbed swimming students tosimulate a panicked air crash survivor, has been dropped from thecurriculum, and students now will practice rescue drills on eachother.   Other changes call for training to stop immediately for studentswho ask to quit or show signs of panic, fear or extreme fatigue.   Mirecki had a phobia about being dragged under water thattriggered heart failure caused by ``sheer terror,'' followed bydrowning, a pathologist testified during an investigative hearingtwo weeks ago.</TEXT></DOC>
