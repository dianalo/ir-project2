The struggling computer giant said the bankers extended a waiver of non-compliance with the net worth requirements of its revolving credit lines to Aug. 16. The waiver was to have expired yesterday.    Wang fell out of compliance with the debt agreements last week when it posted a net loss of $374.7 million for its fourth quarter ended June 30. Frederick A. Wang, president and chief operating officer, resigned Tuesday. His father, An Wang, who is chairman, founder and chief executive oficer, said the company will search for an outsider to fill the posts.    In American Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Wang Class B shares slipped 37.5 cents to close at $6.875, with 2 million shares changing hands. Wang Class C stock, which elects a majority of the company's board, closed at $12 a share, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
