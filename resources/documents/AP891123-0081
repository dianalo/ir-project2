Mrs. Thatcher visits the United States once a year on theaverage, and this 24-hour trip was arranged weeks before thepolitical picture in Europe was transformed by the opening of theBerlin Wall.   But the visit to Camp David now takes on added significance,given the West's need to formulate a united response to thechanges. It comes eight days before Bush's summit with Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. A summit of the 12-nation EuropeanEconomic Community states follows on Dec. 8-9.   Mrs. Thatcher told reporters as she left for the airport: ``I'mdelighted with his (Bush's) speech last night.''   She was referring to Bush's televised address to the nationWednesday night in which he praised Gorbachev's reforms, urged himto ``bring down the last barriers'' and end the Cold War, andpromised to support the reforms in Eastern Europe without takingadversarial advantage of them.   After several meetings with Gorbachev, Mrs. Thatcher is effusivein her praise, lauding him as a reformer of courage and vision. Butshe is also cautious about his chances of completing the revolutionhe has unleashed.   Therefore, she continues to advocate a strong NATO and opposesany changes in the present lineup of NATO and Warsaw Pact forces,lest they become ammunition for Gorbachev's hard-line foes.   She reiterated this stance in her legislative program for 1990,which pledged Britain to uphold its NATO obligations and ``sustainthe United Kingdom's contribution to Western defense by maintainingadequate and effective nuclear and conventional forces.''   Giving her view of European events, she said: ``Times of greatchange are times of great uncertainty, even danger.   ``We have to be prepared for any threat, however unexpected. Asevents demonstrate ever more conclusively, we are winning thebattle of ideas. We must make sure that we don't subsequently losethe peace.''   She and Bush will likely discuss the NATO states' decision inMay to defer until 1992 a firm decision on the deployment of newshort-range nuclear missiles in West Germany.   Even before the Wall opened, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohlwas balking at having to take new missiles. Now the task is farmore complex, but Mrs. Thatcher remains committed to it.   Domestically, the 64-year-old prime minister is looking morevulnerable than when she last visited Washington a year ago to saygoodbye to her ideological soulmate, Ronald Reagan, and welcomeBush into the fold of Western democratic leaders.   Resurgent inflation and criticism of her combative style ofleadership have pushed her as far as 11 points behind theopposition Labor Party in opinion polls.   Before the year is out she is likely to face an unprecedentedformal challenge to her leadership. The annual election ofConservative Party leader has been a formality throughout her 10years in office. But this time, rank-and-file lawmaker Sir AnthonyMeyer says he will probably seek her job.   He has no chance of success, but says he hopes his move willgalvanize other disenchanted Tories into sending her a message ofdiscontent.</TEXT></DOC>
