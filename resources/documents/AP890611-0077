As the rescue plan moves to the House floor this week, it wasmostly liberal Democrats scrambling to salvage the key reform in thepresident's package _ making all thrift operators put up real moneyas capital as a buffer between risky loans and the government'sdeposit insurance funds.   Bush and other industry critics have blamed loose governmentregulations and accounting practices that have allowed Sandamp;Ls toattract and lend federally insured deposits with little or no moneyof their own at risk as the primary cause of the thrift crisis.   While Bush proposed stiffer capital standards in general terms,it was one of the Congress's most liberal Democrats, HowardMetzenbaum of Ohio, who put a real dollar figure behind it _ $1.50in capital for every $100 in loans by June 1991 _ when the Senatepassed its version in April.   The administration immediately embraced Metzenbaum's measure andasked for more.   The House Banking Committee complied, adopting the $1.50 standardby 1991 and upping the ante by telling Sandamp;Ls they will have to have$3 in capital for every $100 in loans by 1995 over the opposition ofmost of its GOP members.   ``So far it looks like the Republicans are more interested inweakening the president's own bill and the Democrats more interestedin helping him,'' said Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio. ``We intend tomake it somewhat of a political test.''   The Senate, meanwhile, is expected to spend most of the weekdebating a bill to lift the remaining government price controls onnatural gas.   Only about one-third of the nation's supply of the fuel is stillunder the controls. Experts generally agree prices to consumerswould not rise if it is decontrolled because current market pricesare well below the federal ceiling.   However, many acknowledge that anticipated increased demand fornatural gas in the 1990s could drive gas prices much higher then.   The battle over cash investment requirements for savings andloans underscores one of the differences between banks and Sandamp;Ls ingeneral.   Even though banks already have twice as tough capitalrequirements _ $6 for every $100 in loans and expected to rise to $8in the near future _ many of the nation's biggest Sandamp;Ls cried foul atraising their requirements and are engaged in an intensive lobbyingeffort to knock some loopholes in the bill on the House floor.   More than two-thirds of the nation's 2,949 Sandamp;Ls already meet the$3 capital requirement. Moreover, all but about 250 of thoseexpected to still be in business once the immediate crisis is solvedare expected to have little trouble meeting the new standard by 1995.   However, about 450 Sandamp;Ls now have absolutely no cash capital andit is their losses of up to $100 billion in depositors' moneydriving the emerging 30-year bailout plan that works about to about$600 for every man, woman and child in the country.   Many Sandamp;Ls are meeting the current capital requirements onlythrough ``supervisory good will'' _ an accounting device regulatorsadopted to encourage healthy thrifts to take over failing Sandamp;Ls inthe early 1980s.   More than 730 Sandamp;Ls now hold about $20 billion in ``supervisorygood will'' exemptions. Effectively, that allows them to lend out$600 billion in federally insured deposits with no money of theirown at risk.   Some of those exemptions were supposed to have lasted for up to40 years. But the life span of all of them would be whittled down tofive years under the bill approved by the House Banking Committeeand endorsed by Bush.   The fight appears to be centering on an amendment by Rep. HenryHyde, R-Ill., to make the government grant hearings to 241 Sandamp;Ls nowpossessing ``good will'' exemptions before making them meet theproposed new standards.   ``The institutions who relied in good faith on the word of thefederal government deserve some consideration,'' Hyde said.According to Michel, about 40 of them are in Illinois.   Rep. Charles Schumer of New York, one of the Democrats leadingthe fight to preserve the tougher capital requirements, said Hyde'sproposal could prevent regulators from moving in on unsound Sandamp;Ls forup to 18 months.   ``This will allow the shysters over and over ... to strip aninstitution of its assets before the regulators could move in,'' hesaid. ``As we're seeing, it only takes a few bad apples to bring awhole industry down.''   Another fight when the bill reaches the floor Wednesday and votesstart Thursday will be over whether to add the immediate $50 billiontaxpayer share of the costs to the federal deficit.</TEXT></DOC>
