The extreme-right National Democratic Party took 6.6 percent ofthe vote, according to preliminary results, winning representationin city government for the first time since 1968.   In January, another far-right party, the Republicans, won seatsin the West Berlin legislature.   Both parties want to sharply reduce the number of foreigners inWest Germany, and their success marks a major shift to the rightamong a growing number of voters.   About two hours after the preliminary results of the vote becameknown, several hundred people demonstrated in front of the city hallagainst the National Democrats. Police reported no incidents.   Kohl's conservatives suffered heavy losses in othermunicipalities in Hesse state, but their worst rout came inFrankfurt, where they had governed alone since 1977.   Preliminary results from the official state voting office, basedon computer projections, gave the Christian Democrats 36.6 percentof the Frankfurt vote. That dropped their representation in citygovernment from 48 to 36 seats.   The leftist Social Democrats, the mainstream opposition party,won 40.1 percent and 40 seats, up from 37 seats won after 1985elections. The anti-NATO Greens won 10.1 percent and 10 seats, upfrom eight previously.   The National Democrats did not run in the 1985 elections.   The outcome ousted Frankfurt's Christian Democratic Mayor WolframBrueck, who will be replaced by Social Democrat Volker Hauff, a48-year-old former federal transport minister.   The leftist Greens also scored major gains in the rest of Hessestate, where 4.1 million voters were eligible to vote. The SocialDemocrats were projected to score moderate statewide gains.   The National Democrats campaigned hard in Frankfurt against thelarge number of foreigners in the city. With 148,000 foreigners _ 25percent of its population _ Frankfurt has the largest proportion offoreigners of West German cities.   The issue was used by the Republicans in the West Berlinelections on Jan. 29. The Republicans won 7.5 percent of the voteand 11 seats in West Berlin's legislature.   The rightists were projected to score minor gains outsideFrankfurt.   Michael Friedmann, a Jewish community leader and a ChristianDemocrat, said the National Democratic gains will have ``seriousconsequences.''   ``This is the worst result of the election,'' Friedmann toldHesse state television. ``This will damage West Germany's reputationabroad.''   The outcome in Frankfurt appeared to pave the way for a leftistcoalition in Frankfurt between the Social Democrats and the Greens.   A similar coalition is expected to start governing in West Berlinnext week after an agreement between the Social Democrats and theAlternative List, a leftist party similar to the Greens.</TEXT></DOC>
