<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-75-0102 </DOCNO><TEXT>In support of implementation of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's SevereAccident Policy, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) hasperformed a study of the risk of core damage to nuclear power plantsin the United States due to ``other external events.'' The broad objectivehas been to gain an understanding of whether ``other external events''(the hazards not covered by previous reports) are among the major potentialaccident initiators that may pose a threat of severe reactor core damageor of large radioactive release to the environment from the reactor.The ``other external events'' covered in this report are nearby industrial/militaryfacility accidents, on site hazardous material storage accidents, severetemperature transients, severe weather storms, lightning strikes, externalfires, extraterrestrial activity, volcanic activity, earth movement,and abrasive windstorms. The analysis was based on two figures-of-merit,one based on core damage frequency and the other based on the frequencyof large radioactive releases. 37 refs., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
