Molecular said U.S. patent #4761373 was issued to company researchers Paul C. Anderson and Kenneth A. Hibberd. The patent is for corn plants that are resistant to several commercial herbicides, as well as corn tissue cultures and seeds from which the plants can be grown.    Kenneth F. Tempero, Molecular's chairman and chief executive officer, said: &quot;We believe the technology from this patent will lead to the first large-scale commercialization of a biotechnology-derived product in the plant area.&quot;    The company, involved in the research and development of hybrid corn and human pharmaceuticals, said that under a research agreement with American Cyanamid Co., Molecular's scientists identified a gene that gives corn a high resistance to a new family of imidazolinone herbicides used against a broad array of weeds.    The research agreement gives Cyanamid the license to commercialize the herbicide-resistant corn hybrids. Cyanamid has given Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc. the sublicense to incorporate the tolerance into its proprietary corn lines, which may be ready for marketing in 1992.    Molecular would receive royalties based on sales of Cyanamid herbicides applied to resistant hybrids. </TEXT></DOC>
