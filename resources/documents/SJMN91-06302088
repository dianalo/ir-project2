There are mostly finaglers.;   Ittakes a fixer to get anything done. There are the lobbyists prowling the hallsof state legislatures, doctors shuffling insured patients from one specialistto another, average citizens diddling with income tax returns.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  AMERICA, LAND OF THE FINAGLE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Commentary; Richard W. Smith writes from Timonium, Md., for the BaltimoreEvening Sun.  </MEMO><TEXT>     The finaglers are the tops. They are rewarded with incomes far greater thanthose earned by mere productive citizens. Lobbyists collect far more incomethan do mere lawmakers. Political consultants earn more than U.S. senators --despite the senators' own midnight finagle to increase their own salaries.;  Hundreds of Sandamp;L officers, bank officials and insurance company bigwigs havefinagled benefits in the millions out of companies that they have mismanagedinto oblivion.;   Corporate leaders leverage (finagle) whole companies intoand out of existence by manipulating paper documents faster than a slothfulbureaucracy can keep up with them.;   Nothing can be done in Washingtonwithout a public relations firm running interference. The finagling techniqueswork equally well with both good and bad ideas, constructive and destructivecauses.;   The foreign policy finaglers have made the State Department largelyirrelevant. The CIA and the National Security Council hop around the worldstarting revolutions, selling arms and sending cakes to the religious head ofthe Iranian government. Because much of this is conducted under &quot;deepfinagle,&quot; it is considered to be far more important than mere diplomacy.;  Finaglers have gained an honored place in American society. At one time, theman and woman in the street had a local ward &quot;fixer&quot; who could be called uponto fix a traffic ticket or find a civil service job for a deadbeat relative.The fixer was a valued but not honored member of the community. Today'sfinagler is a consultant welcomed at the best parties and honored, if notvalued, by virtue of his or her relative wealth.;   So much effort goes intofinagling that there is little productive work being done. Even &quot;real&quot; eventsare quickly absorbed by the finaglers. Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf's victory inDesert Storm was quickly taken over by the finaglers. A ghost writer wasassigned, an agent hired, a lecture tour booked, photo ops planned. Thegeneral quickly disappeared behind the screen of finaglers.;   Theoverwhelming pervasiveness of finagling techniques makes it impossible todistinguish between the real and the false.;   There was a time when finaglingwas openly disreputable. The men and women in slick offices who pullhigh-level finagling strings were once known as &quot;flacks,&quot; and not many peopletook them seriously. Flacks became press agents, press agents became publicrelations people, and now they are &quot;communications consultants&quot; with officersin towers so high it requires two elevators to reach them.;   It is not thatfinagling is without effort. Some finaglers expend effort that would almostcertainly make them a success in actual, productive work. It is just thatthere are more satisfactions and even social status in finagling. Thereappears to be real satisfaction in manipulative work that skirts ethical andlegal limits. It is a trapeze act that provides the true finaglers with a highthey could never get from productive work. It also enables them to feel vastlysuperior to men and women in run-of-the-mill jobs.;   The current recessionhas had the sobering effect of eliminating the thousands of people in thecorporate world who did little but write memos to each other. These were the&quot;facilitators,&quot; those who occupy personnel slots halfway between the truefinaglers and the truly productive.;   America's furious embrace of thecomputer seems to satisfy the lust for finagling. Computers permit endlessmanipulation of data, endless invasion of privacy and endless ways to finaglebank and stock transfers, to launder money and to harass helpless citizenswith junk mail. It may be no coincidence that worker productivity in theUnited States has fallen steadily as computers have proliferated.;   Perhapsthere is a bit of larceny in all of us, and we admire the finagler who canstrike quickly and cleanly, never leaving evidence of a smoking gun. Americansdream of winning the lottery or of finding a finagle that pays well. Given achoice, they would probably opt for the finagle.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RICHARD W.
