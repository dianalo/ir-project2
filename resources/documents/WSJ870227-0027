Jacobs</HL><DD> 02/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TAXES </IN><TEXT>   For self-employed professionals and small-business owners, the new tax law changes the rules, closing some loopholes while lowering tax rates. But it doesn't eliminate tax-saving opportunities or incentives to use them. And it retains traps that are sure to increase the tax bills of the unwary.    To cope with all the changes, &quot;you need to look at the owners and the business as an economic unit and maximize the wealth of that combined unit,&quot; says Joseph Tapagni, a tax partner and specialist in closely held businesses for accountants Arthur Andersen's Chicago office.    Even something as basic as whether to operate through a corporation needs to be reexamined: The old law's 46% top tax rate for corporations was lower than the 50% maximum rate on individuals, providing an incentive to incorporate. That incentive now is gone.    For a company reporting on a calendar-year basis, the maximum tax rate in 1987 is 40%; for individuals, the maximum rate is 38.5%. Next year, the top corporate rate falls to 34%, while the top rate for many individuals drops to 28%.    Thus, if the only aim is to save taxes, &quot;it is more attractive to be unincorporated,&quot; says Martin Nissenbaum, senior tax manager in the New York office of accountants Ernst andamp; Whinney.    It is possible to combine the legal flexibility of a corporation and the lower tax rates of an individual by operating as a so-called Subchapter S corporation. Essentially, an S corporation isn't taxed on its earnings; its shareholders are, in much the same way partners are taxed on a partnership's earnings. The shareholders' taxes are usually covered by dividends from the S corporation.    But an S corporation isn't for everyone. Frederick G. Briggs, a tax accountant in Manchester, N.H., says he's finding that becoming an S corporation &quot;doesn't make much sense&quot; for small closely held concerns.    There might not be enough taxable income to make a difference, for one thing. The first $50,000 of corporate taxable income is subject to tax rates of only 18% in 1987 and 15% in 1988. And unlike a regular corporation (known as a &quot;C corporation&quot; in tax parlance), an S corporation can't deduct the cost of medical and accident insurance for employees.    In many instances, losing this deduction may &quot;more than eliminate the advantage of going to an S corporation,&quot; Mr. Briggs says. That decision, he says, would have to be made &quot;on a case-by-case basis by running the numbers.&quot;    Bank loans also can be an obstacle to seeking S corporation status. Commercial loans to closely held corporations often prohibit paying dividends until the loan is repaid, says Matthew C. Kessler, tax partner in the Chicago office of accountants Grant Thornton. But S corporation owners need those payments to cover their taxes.    &quot;We need to educate bankers on this point,&quot; he says. &quot;It's a real business problem that can come up.&quot;    In addition, Mr. Kessler says, corporations in states that don't recognize S corporations could be subject to state income tax.    Some people treat their corporations as a personal bank and, in violation of tax rules, have the company pay their personal expenses, recording and deducting them as legitimate business expenses. Such people won't adopt S corporations, one accountant says, because they &quot;feel it's easier to bury things on a corporate tax return than on a 1040-C (tax form) attached to their personal tax return.&quot;    The new tax law bans one simple ploy that many self-employed professionals had used to defer tax on income: adopting a fiscal year for a partnership or professional service corporation operated as an S corporation. If the fiscal year ended June 30, for example, tax on the income wasn't due until the following April 15.    The new law requires most of these entities to switch to a calendar year beginning with the first accounting period that starts after 1986. Thus, a professional service corporation with a June 30 year-end would switch to a calendar year beginning July 1; its first calendar year would end Dec. 31, covering only six months. One result could be to tax the owners this year on 18 months' income: from the 12 months ending June 30 and the six months ending Dec. 31.    However, Congress provided for some relief. Taxpayers may spread income from the short calendar year over four years, in effect paying tax on 25% of the short year's earnings each year. That makes it advantageous to move as much income as possible into the short year.    Another change ends the deduction for additions to a reserve for bad debts. The deduction is barred for accounting years ending in 1988 and thereafter; rather than use such a reserve, businesses can only deduct debts that are actually uncollectible.    Amounts set aside under the old rules generally will become taxable income, but the sums can be spread evenly over four years. For businesses whose 1987 fiscal years haven't yet ended, there is time to use this new provision to advantage.    &quot;The strategy, where you can legally do it, is to maximize the (bad-debt) reserve at year's end,&quot; says Alan P. Sklar, managing partner of accountants Gleeson, Sklar andamp; Sawyer, Chicago. That will increase the bad-debt reserve deduction in the last year it can be taken; when that income later becomes taxable, the tax can be spread over four years.    Another strategy seeks to capitalize on the disparity between personal tax rates this year and next.    The difference between the 38.5% maximum rate for individuals this year and the 28% rate for many of them next year is &quot;not something to be ignored,&quot; says Wallace Head, director of personal financial planning at Arthur Andersen. Droves of high-earning executives already have begun to defer some compensation to 1988 as a result.    Advisers caution that a deferred-compensation agreement between a closely held business and its owner might not stand up to IRS scrutiny. Professionals, however, can defer income by delaying billing clients.    The flip side of this strategy is to accelerate deductions in 1987, when rates are higher and write-offs will have more value. But Mr. Head notes that this would risk triggering the toughened alternative minimum tax, which can wipe out the benefits.    &quot;We saw some people go overboard in 1986 and defer so much income and accelerate so much in expenses that they went into the alternative minimum tax and lost the benefit of the deductions,&quot; he says. The risk of that is even greater this year, he says, as the new law widened the scope of that tax.    David B. Hawkes, a tax partner in the Portland, Maine, office of accountants Peat, Marwick, Mitchell andamp; Co., advises, &quot;Don't defer income without being aware that the (lower tax) rate could be taken away.&quot; Already, there has been talk in Congress of putting tax rates back up to cut the federal deficit.    Tax-shelter rules in effect for the first time this year put a halt to another favorite strategy of professionals and business owners. Previously, a group of physicians or other professionals could own their office building and equipment and charge themselves just enough rent to cover the cost of carrying those assets. Then they could use the tax shelter that resulted when depreciation on the property produced a loss.    Now, such rental deals are defined as &quot;passive&quot; activity; the doctors are in the medical business, not the real estate business. And under the new code, individuals generally can't deduct passive losses from other income. Passive losses can be deducted only to the extent there is passive income. If there isn't any, the losses accumulate, and the total eventually can be deducted from any gain from selling the rental property.    An exception allows individuals in certain income brackets to deduct as much as $25,000 a year for passive losses on real estate rentals. But the deduction starts to shrink for taxpayers with more than $100,000 in adjusted gross income, and it disappears at $150,000.    Passive losses are useful for people with passive income. That includes S corporation stockholders who don't participate in the business. Their share of the firm's earnings is considered passive income.    Under the previous law, it also was beneficial to shift income to children who were in a lower tax bracket than their parents. This was commonly done to accumulate money for the children's education. A popular device, called the Clifford trust, put income-earning assets into a trust with more than a 10-year life. The children were the beneficiaries, and the income was taxed at their rate. When the trust expired, the assets reverted to the parents.    The new law kills such arrangements. It applies the parents' tax rate to income of children under 14 years old and repeals the Clifford trust rules.    One way a family with a profitable S corporation might work around these rules, according to Mr. Nissenbaum of Ernst andamp; Whinney, is to give their children tax shelters producing passive losses and make them stockholders in the S corporation. Corporate earnings will be passive income for children who aren't active in the business; and this income then can be offset by passive losses from the tax shelters.    This works for commercial enterprises but not for personal service corporations, Mr. Nissenbaum says, as the law doesn't allow personal service concerns to assign personal income.    Putting money into retirement accounts has been a lucrative shelter for some folks. &quot;If you had a good-sized salary, you could sock away $150,000 for, say, approximately seven years,&quot; says Linda Forman, partner and head of pension consulting at Gleeson, Sklar andamp; Sawyer. That was done by setting up a plan to provide the maximum $75,000-a-year pension with retirement at age 55. With only seven years or so to fund this benefit, the annual contribution exceeded $100,000 -- and was deductible in full.    The new law drops the maximum benefit under such a plan to $45,000 a year. That means some of these plans are already fully funded, and no more contributions will be allowed.    &quot;I have some clients who were putting away $165,000 a year for themselves, and their contribution drops to zero in 1987,&quot; Mrs. Forman says.    ---   Mr. Jacobs is a senior special writer in The Wall Street Journal's New York Bureau.
