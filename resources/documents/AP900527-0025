Certain classes of drugs _ heart, anti-inflammatory,psychopharmacologic, dermatologic and antibiotic _ were most likelyto have serious post-approval reactions, the General AccountingOffice said in a report prepared for release Sunday.   Especially ``troubling,'' said the GAO, was that drugs for useby children were twice as likely to have reports of seriousunanticipated reactions after their approval by the Food and DrugAdministration.   The GAO reviewed label changes for the 209 new drugs that wereapproved from 1976 to 1985 to determine the seriousness ofadditional risks identified after the drugs were approved.   The study found that of the 198 drugs for which data could befound, 102, or 51.5 percent, had reports of serious adversereactions. Those reactions were defined as leading tohospitalization or increased length of hospitalization, orresulting in severe or permanent disability or death.   Six of the drugs were withdrawn from the market and labels onthe rest were changed to add major warnings or precautions fortheir use, or to restrict for whom the drug should be prescribed,the report said.   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., who requested the report, saidshortcomings in the FDA's drug approval process may be responsiblefor serious adverse reactions.   ``Serious and unanticipated adverse reactions are certainly arisk we must accept when FDA shortens the review time forexperimental drugs to treat immediately life-threatening illnessessuch as AIDS and cancer,'' Weiss said.   But for less serious diseases, ``this may be too high a price topay for shorter approval times,'' he said.   ``By failing to systematically use evidence of post-approvalrisks linked to drugs already on the market, FDA may be overlookingproblems with similar drugs under review at the agency but not yetapproved,'' Weiss said.   The FDA, in comments included in the report, said the GAO'sreview was ``not methodologically sound'' and would ``unnecessarilyalarm consumers.''   ``Even the most extensive pre-market testing cannot cover allpossible circumstances,'' said FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit. ``Testingperhaps 3,000 people over months or years won't always identify arare reaction unfolding over a long time or affecting perhaps justone person in 10,000.''   He said that is why FDA monitors reports of adverse drugreactions after a product is marketed.   It can take as long as eight to 10 years for a drug to movethrough the FDA approval process, beginning when a company appliesfor permission to test a new product in humans.   The first studies test the drug's safety in a small number ofpeople. Later, the drug is tested for effectiveness. If after theFDA reviews all the data _ which on average takes 29 months,according to GAO _ the drug may be approved for marketing.   Because the pre-approval testing involves small numbers ofpatients, more information about the drug usually surfaces afterthe drug is approved and distributed widely. The FDA monitorsreports of adverse reactions and sometimes requires post-approvalresearch as a condition of approval.   The time between a drug's approval and a post-marketing labelchange is five years or more, the GAO report said.   The congressional auditors recommended that FDA establish asystematic procedure to assure that serious reactions discoveredafter a drug's approval are evaluated to identify possible riskswith similar drugs not yet on the market.</TEXT></DOC>
