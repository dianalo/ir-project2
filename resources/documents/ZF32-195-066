 Merrill andamp; Bryan's $79.95package is one of the most careful, ambitious, and thorough reporting toolsaround.andP;  When you see the information it ferrets out of your machine, you'llprobably want to replace the utilities you use now,andM;EVERY IMAGINABLE DETAILandM;Like Manifest, InfoSpotter can run as a standalone application or as a TSR sothat you can pop it up and find conflicts while they occur.andP;  In either mode,there's very little information that it can't spot, and in many cases, allowto you change.andP;  The clearly-arranged drop-down menus show virtually everyimaginable detail about your BIOS, CMOS, I/O and video ports, plusexceptionally thorough information on software interrupts and hardware IRQs.andO;A startup option lets you display COM3 and COM4 in addition to COM1 and COM2.andO;InfoSpotter was almost alone in its ability to recognize that IRQ11 was usedon my system with the Intel SatisFAXtion board.andP;  On one of our test machines,however, it occasionally caused a cold reboot when it attempted to list DMAassignments.andM;Its memory reporting is exceptionally thorough, with an optional startupswitch that gives you a full survey of upper memory addresses that let youmake the fullest use of 386 memory managers.andP;  It has no trouble identifyingprograms loaded in UMBs by any 386 memory manager, unlike Manifest and ASQ,which are fully successful only with QEMM and 386MAK respectively.andP;  If yourun InfoSpotter from the DOS prompt-instead of popping it up as a TSR-itintelligently leaves itself out of its own report on DOS memory usage, so youcan see what your RAM will look like after you exit the program and go onwith your work.andM;InfoSpotter lets you display the contents of anything in memory, includingexpanded memory and XMS memory.andP;  It provides full plain-English displays ofthe BIOS data area and CMOS, and even lets you edit the CMOS.andP;  You can alsoedit CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, and add up to four of your ownprograms to the package's menus.andM;The program comes with a library of information on common BIOSs and MCA POSadapters, which it uses when making positive identifications.andP;  An extensivehelp system makes it easy to maneuver your way through the program's widerange of choices.andP;  You can print a partial report (or send it to a file) fromany submenu or any of the main menu items (Memory, BIOS, etc.), or you cantell the program to create a full report.andP;  You can also get usefuloptimization hints similar to those provided by Manifest.andM;TORTURE TESTandM;InfoSpotter doesn't try to report on everything.andP;  It doesn't identify SCSI orESDI hard disks, although it gives exhaustive details on partition tables,and even shows you what you would see if you examined the disk in FDISK.andO;Oddly, it doesn't try to tell you the processor speed of your CPU.andP;  On ourtest systems, it committed some minor errors.andP;  On one test system it failedto locate the joystick connected to the Sound Blaster card (only QAPluspassed this test).andP;  More surprisingly, it was fooled by the test in which wetwiddled the coprocessor equipment byte so that the machine claimed to have a8x87 chip that in fact wasn't really there.andP;  On one test machine, the programgot confused by something in the DOS area and reported nonsensical figuresfor the size of DOS itself But this is in an area where no one else evenattempts to report similar levels of detail.andP;  It got similarly confused bythe presence of Software Carousel, a task switcher.andM;Although the program never had any trouble reporting the size of theenvironment, it was unable to display COMSPEC and the rest of the environmentin two systems that had QEMM-386 installed and reported that DOS had noenvironment table.andP;  This was especially strange because I was able to shellout to DOS from the InfoSpotter table and get this information simply bytyping SET at the command line.andM;InfoSpotter's manual is lucid and complete, but lacks an index.andP;  A stapledaddendum updates the manual for the release we examined, Version 2.5, but themanual itself should have been reprinted.andP;  These, however, are relativelytrivial complaints about one of the very few programs that provide anadvanced and complete solution to the reporting needs of any computingenvironment.andP;  Take a good look at InfoSpotter.andM;Fact FileandM;InfoSpotter, Version 2.5andM;Merrill andamp; Bryan, 9770 Carroll Center Rd., Suite C, San Diego, CA 92126;619-6898611.andM;List Price:  79'95.andM;Requires: 266K RAM (150K free), DOS 2.1 or later.andM;In Short: A very powerful system reporting utility, this program lacks onlylow-level disk formatting details.andP;  it provides extremely detailed memoryreports and the ability to work with any memory manager.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
