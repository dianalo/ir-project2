The Roster willbe operated by the Conference for the primary benefit of other Federalagencies and parties to disputes involving administrative programs. TheRoster is intended to increase agencies' ability expeditiously to locateand retain mediators, trainers, and other apt neutrals across the countryby creating a clearinghouse of basic data and increasing agency officials'awareness of the availability of alternative means of dispute resolution.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>October 30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Charles Pou, Jr., 202-254-7020.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">A. General Background</ITAG>The Roster will contain basic data on neutrals, so as to increase agencies'access to mediation services. The Roster has its origins in a series ofConference recommendations and studies on acquiring the services of personsto assist agencies in using alternative means of dispute resolution. TheRoster will further the Conference's statutory mission to serve as a clearinghousefor interchange of information potentially useful in improving administrativeprocedure.As described in the notice of proposed rulemaking (``NPR'') dated May 22,1989 (54 FR 21957), the Conference generally would not try to match neutralsto particular disputes. Rather, it would generally provide a list of likelycandidates from the Roster, taking into account the specifications of partiesto disputes. All neutrals who supply the basic data will be listed. Therules make it clear to parties that the Conference will not guarantee theaccuracy of information in its files.To avoid conflicts of interest for neutrals, the rules require neutralson the Roster to abide by the Society of Professionals in Dispute Resolutioncode of conduct that details what a neutral should disclose and how tohandle potential conflicts of interest, as well as any other code to whichthe neutral is subject. While the Conference reserves the right to removeneutrals who have falsified information or otherwise clearly violated acceptedethical standards, it would not ordinarily evaluate the quality of workby neutrals on the Roster.<ITAG tagnum="84">B.

GeneralAll commenters except Carrington expressed support for a Conference Roster;Jones of ATandamp;T, typically, thought it ``would be of great assistancein promoting both agency and private party use of ADR.'' Newkirk and Dozierof Clean Sites wrote that the Conferences's proposal would encourage useof mediation and make the task of finding experienced and qualified neutralseasier for potential users. Carrington was dubious because of the Roster'slack of standards, discussed below.2. Qualification for NeutralsUnder andSection; 316.200, the Roster includes persons who provide all informationrequired. Most of the commenters supported the proposed ``disclosure''approach. Newkirk and Dozier, for example, said.<ITAG tagnum="21">We agree with the Conference's decision to allow the potential usersof the service to determine the appropriate qualifications of a neutral,rather than have that decision made by the list keeper. At this point,at least, mediation and other ADR techniques are still evolving. To havetoo rigid a barrier to entry may not serve the needs of the potential usersof the roster. The parties to a dispute should have the right to choosewhomever they find acceptable. The roster function should merely be anefficient mechanism for the dissemination of information about potentialneutrals.</ITAG>These and other commenters also pointed out that the proposed rules seemto follow <T3>The Report of the Society of Professionals in Dispute Resolution Commissionon Qualifications.</T3> That report, by a specially-appointed panel ofdispute resolvers and other experts, addressed the issue of how best toqualify neutrals.Like the SPIDR Commission, the Conference membership has spoken to theprinciples for agency use of neutrals. In Recommendation 86-8, it stated,<ITAG tagnum="21">While skill or experience in the process of resolving disputes, suchas that possessed by mediators and arbitrators, is usually an importantcriterion in the selection of neutrals, and knowledge of the applicablestatutory and regulatory schemes may at times be important, other specificqualifications should be required only when necessary for resolution ofthe dispute. For example:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Agencies should not necessarily disqualify persons who have mediation,arbitration or judicial experience but no specific experience in the particularADR process being pursued***.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Agencies should insist upon technical expertise in the substantiveissues underlying the dispute or negotiated rulemaking only when the technicalissues are so complex that the neutral could not effectively understandand communicate the parties' positions without it.</ITAG>The Office of the Chairman has considered the various possible approachesto qualifications for listing, and their legal, practical, and other consequences;in developing the proposed rules it worked with EPA to obtain a reportfrom ICF Incorporated on the pros and cons of each. It has also read withinterest the thoughtful and persuasive report of SPIDR's Commission onQualifications, and is mindful in particular of its advice that ``[n]ostandards or qualifications should be required that would prevent any personfrom providing dispute resolution services, when parties have free choiceof the process, program, <T3>and</T3> individual neutral,'' provided that the parties are givenaccess to certain specified information about the neutral.Theoretically, major sources of ADR neutrals include ex-judges, BCA members,ALJs, other active judges, academics, current government employees, retiredgovernment employees, private practitioners, and mediators or other ADRexperts. Dipping into any of these potential pools has ramifications, manyobvious and others fairly subtle. A variety of approaches to selectingand evaluating these persons have been put forward. Many experts in ADRprocesses maintain that neutrals need no legal or other special training;rather, they say, the critical determinant is the neutral's acceptibility.They point out that many cases turn on engineering, accounting, or othertechnical or scientific questions. Some suggest that mediation training,is useful, or even necessary, allowing the neutral to respond perceptivelyto the principals' wishes and help further negotiations if asked. A fewgo so far as to suggest that <T3>only</T3> mediators (or similar experts) can serve effectively as neutralsor make credentials decisions. Others maintain legal expertise to be a<T3>sine qua non.</T3> They note that the principals and their staffs willlikely have the background to weigh technical issues, but would frequentlybenefit from independent legal advice, on often-arcane matters, that willlet them better assess risks, reach a decision, and ``sell'' or defenda settlement within their organizations. Some agencies, like the Corpsof Engineers and the Navy, have required government contracting and litigationexperience for neutrals in contract cases.While mindful of concerns over the Roster's credibility, the Conference's_indeed,anyone's_present ability to fix and fairly enforce meaningful, consistentqualifications criteria which would be relevant to every situation is doubtful.Many questions would need to be answered. What standards of education,or experience, or performance, or third-party recommendations, should beused? Is hands-on evaluation of individual neutrals practicable, or desirable?If so, by whom? What criteria and scoring system should apply? Should theRoster be limited to a small, elite group, on the theory that this willenhance the credibility of the nascent process and tend to cause thoseon the list to view their role as a public service? If so, what shouldthe review and appeals processes be? Should any particular groups, suchas government personnel or private attorneys, be wholly excluded on groundsthat one side or the other likely will strike them for possible bias orconflict of interest?A disclosure approach avoids having the Conference set itself up, or sponsorprivate (and possibly partial) groups, to exclude possibly less qualifiedneutrals. Consistent with the SPIDR report and Recommendation 86-8, theConference's approach should broaden the base of qualified neutrals, avoidneedless exclusivity, and encourage thoughtful selection by parties.Two comments cautioned that this approach could cause an adverse effectamong potential users due to a lack of listing standards. Goldberg thoughtit could lower the Roster's credibility among users, and advocated a centralbody ``that potential users could communicate with that would describeand recommend particular neutrals.''Carrington also advocated selectivity. He stated, ``There is little doubtthat it matters who the neutral is.'' He would be surprised, he said,<ITAG tagnum="21"> * * * to learn that the government has the manpower and contactsto do an effective job of identifying appropriate neutrals for the wholespectrum of government agencies. There is, moreover, a significant politicalproblem in keeping underqualified persons off your certified list.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">My suggestion would be that in lieu of a central roster of neutrals,the government put its good housekeeping seal on private institutions thatexhibit the appropriate level of care in the selection of neutrals forparticular kinds of cases.</ITAG>Private institutions, said Carrington, could exercise judgment to screenapplicants for temperament and competence in specific areas (e.g., constructiondisputes). He concluded,<ITAG tagnum="21">If the United States is not comfortable with certifying providersof neutrals, but wants its own list, then I would urge that you considercontracting out the development of that list. This Center could perhapsdevelop such a list, and there may be other institutions that could doit. At least we could think about the burdens and consider what we mightlearn from undertaking to do it.</ITAG>There is certainly a place for private groups or other government agenciesto develop selective, specialized lists of arbitrators, mediators, or others.Presumably, if such groups were interested in broader government use oftheir services they would register with the Conference (and, if they wished,register individually the persons on their lists). There is also a placefor a nonjudgmental information clearinghouse that makes available to potentialusers extensive data on prospective neutrals. Agencies desiring greaterselectivity (such as the Farmers Home Administration) remain free to developtheir own qualifications and listings, or contract to have it done.Some persons with marginal professional credentials now call themselvesmediators, and will register. Some of these registrants will prove talentedand effective; a few will not. Agencies can examine potential neutrals'various qualifications and select according to their needs. Given thatunder present GAO doctrine agencies will almost always employ Roster neutralsas mediators in aid of parties' settlement negotiations_and <T3>not</T3> as arbitrators with authority to render binding decisions_wesee little reason to exclude arbitrarily any potential registrants. Ofcourse, the Conference plans to review its policy and Roster operationsperiodically to determine if changes in this, or other, areas would improveperformance.For these reasons, the Conference intends to pursue a policy of disclosureby, rather than pre-qualification of, neutrals.3. Operating the Roster(a) <T3>Listing data</T3> (andSection; 316.200). The Conference's May NPR indicatedthat neutrals wishing to be listed must provide fee data. Krickenbergercautioned that neutral's fee data could be misleading, that requiring itcould disadvantage certain ``federal funded research and development centers,''and that such data might be viewed as sensitive, proprietary information,not ``FOIAable.'' She advocated deleting any prerequisite for disclosingfee schedules. Keating cautioned against suggesting that users might,<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * expect some of the listed mediators and other neutrals to providetheir services <T3>gratis.</T3> Competent, experienced professional mediators do not giveaway their services; conversely, inexperienced and unprofessional mediatorsare frequently willing to donate their services in order to gain experience.Were this a listing for medical, legal, therapeutic or virtually any othertype of professional service, it would never contain the suggestions ofthe availability of <T3>pro bono </T3>work. The Roster is a positive step in the directionof professionalizing the provision of neutral services; it should not underminethat positive impact with a counterproductive suggestion of the ready availabilityof free neutral services.</ITAG>These concerns are real. However, several experienced neutrals and organizationshave expressed interest in making <T3>pro bono</T3> contributions to encourage agency interest and establishmediation in new areas. Many lawyers already contribute <T3>pro bono </T3>time to public interest causes. The Conference does notwish to force general disclosure of sensitive data, or to encourage usersto seek free, or second-rate, services. Conversely, it does not wish artificiallyto restrict available data. The final rule makes voluntary, rather thanmandatory, the provision of the fee schedules and related information (e.g.,willingness to provide <T3>pro bono</T3> services). Moreover, request forms will not encourageusers to focus heavily on these issues. Any user wishing to receive thesedata, however, will be provided with them, and can use them in requestingand evaluating panels of neutrals.(b) <T3>Registration decisions </T3>(andSection; 316.203). Kelsey suggested revisingpart of subsection 203(b) as follows: ``A prospective registrant shallbe notified in writing of a decision that an application is <T3>accepted,</T3> incomplete or inaccurate <T3>within 30 days of receipt by the Chairman.</T3>'' He explained, ``Theseadditions, rather than leaving a registrant in a state of limbo, informthe registrant within a time certain of the definite status of the application.''The Conference will promptly dealing with neutrals' registration, and allother Roster processes. A specific deadline does not seem necessary. Thisis especially so given that in the Roster's early operation the Conferencemay be dealing with a large volume of registrations during any period.Conference recommendations encourage agencies to use flexible time guidelines,as opposed to rigid deadlines. The final rule requires that neutrals be<T3>promptly</T3> advised of the adequacy of their registration data.(c) <T3>Roster fees policy</T3> (andSection; 316.203(e)). Subsection (e) reservesthe right to charge fees for obtaining or renewing listing or for usingthe Roster. Kelsey cautioned,<ITAG tagnum="21">If the Conference decides to establish fees for listing and renewals,potential registrants need to be advised of that in advance of registering.At a minimum, the fees need to be set out in the registration and renewalforms, if not set forth in the regulations themselves. Because all butthe most modest registration or renewal fees may discourage potential neutralsfrom applying for listing on the roster, I would encourage the Conferenceto consider absorbing all the administrative costs of the Roster in theuse fee charged to the federal agencies.</ITAG>At present, the Conference does not intend to assess fees for a neutral'slisting on the Roster, or for use of the Roster in disputes regarding federaladministrative programs. The Conference certainly would give prior noticewere it to charge for using the Roster, renewal of listings, or for initiallisting in the future. As stated below, the Conference retains the rightto charge fees for parties' use of the Roster services in disputes <T3>other</T3> than those related to Federal programs. The Conference wouldso notify parties at the time the request is received.(d) <T3>Provision of panels</T3> (andSection; 316.301(a)). This section states,``The Chairman may establish for the purpose the parties with a list ofnames of neutrals.'' Kelsey asked, ``How will the Chairman select namesfrom the roster to refer to parties requesting a list of neutrals? In evaluatingthe qualification of neutrals on the roster to fulfill a particular request,how will ``process experience'' be weighted compared to ``case experience?''Will those on the roster with the most hours of experience or trainingor the most cases under their belts always be referred ahead of those withless experience? * * * Whatever selection process is used, to be successfulit must treat all neutrals equitably. If the selection process is perceivedby any neutrals to discriminate unfairly against their experience and training,the whole program will suffer.''The Office of the Chairman agrees, and wishes to ensure that the processis, and is seen to be, fair. However, flexibility needs suggest that theConference should not, for now, bind itself by an inflexible regulationto follow a formulaic, unvarying process. In the main, the expressed wishesof requesting parties will govern panel selection, and we have developeddetailed forms to further their process of specifying desired characteristics.If more neutrals ``match'' the characteristics than the parties seek, arandom process would generally be used to select approximately the numberspecified by the parties. The Conference may occasionally expand its searchto include additional categories besides those specifically requested byusers, or to add to the list a few names that the Conference, or knowledgeabledispute resolvers, believes might be effective. The great bulk of referrals,however, will be made by a basically random selection according to users'requests.4. Other Users Listees(a) <T3>Listees.</T3> Several commenters pointed out that the Roster shouldmake provision for mediation trainers, mediation systems design experts,and special masters. Keating in particular advocated making the Rosterfacilities available to federal judges throughout the country, for selectionof special masters. These suggestions are adopted in the rules and in day-to-dayuse.Swankin of RADC, and several others, suggested that the Roster rules beamended to deal with organizations, as well as individual neutrals. Hestated.<ITAG tagnum="21">For example, suppose an agency wanted a roster that indicated priorexperience in dealing with state governments <T3>and</T3> in dealing with labor unions. In the case of our firm, oneassociate has extensive experience as a labor arbitrator, and another hasspent most of her time on issues at the state and local level, but neverin situtations or on issues involving organized labor. As a firm, we meetboth criteria; individually, both associates would come up short.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I'm not certain of the solution. One that comes to mind, and whichwe offer for your consideration, is to develop a second roster of firms,and cross-reference individuals to firms with which they are associated.While in most cases an agency will be contracting with an individual toact as negotiator, the fact that an individual is connected to a firm mightbe a factor the requesting agency would want to take into account in decidingwhom to interview. Since the ACUS rosters are clearly not endorsements,I don't think a separate, cross-referenced roster of firms would raiseany credibility issues not already raised in the proposed rule.</ITAG>The final rule provides for listing of neutrals organizations. We shalldevelop a complementary registration form for these groups.(b) <T3>Users. </T3>Aside from the helpful suggestion regarding judges, a numberof commenters thought that a variety of additional groups might find theRoster useful. Newkirk andamp; Dozier said,<ITAG tagnum="21">Since the proposed rules do not limit the right to request names andotherwise use the roster to Federal entities, it is likely that the rosterwill serve other potential users as well. In Clean Sites' experience, otherusers, such as states, may find the roster a convenient source of mediatorsand other ADR professionals.</ITAG>The final rule gives the Conference discretion to make Roster servicesavailable in cases besides those involving federal administrative programs.The Conference retains the right to assess a fee for making the Rosteravailable in cases not involving federal programs.5. Other CommentsJones and Keating suggested that the Conference work to develop standardcontracts to expedite acquisition of neutrals' services. Jones also thoughtthat the Conference should encourage agencies to adopt pledges to exploreADR usage prior to instituting litigation. These are valuable ideas, andthe Conference may well follow up on them. For now, they are not necessaryto begin operation of the Roster, nor would these rules be an apt placefor dealing with these matters.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.I certify that this action (1) is not a ``major rule'' under ExecutiveOrder 12291, and (2) will not have a significant economic impact, positiveor negative, on a substantial number of small entities, under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 316</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Intergovernmental relations.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William J.
