That her favorite type of man is tall? That the thingthat really turns her off is feet?;   What kind of a survey is this? Not aneasy question to answer.;   Lisa Simmons, a senior editor at Cosmo who workedon the survey and the accompanying story, describes it as &quot;very informal.&quot;;  &quot;We contracted that out to the writer and he handed it out to a large numberof people -- friends, friends of friends -- three to 500 people,&quot; saidSimmons.;   Then we called the writer, Philip Nobile. He said he didn't do thesurvey. He said he hadn't even seen the survey until the magazine waspublished.;   &quot;Isn't Cosmo's Brazilian bureau credited with that, orsomething?&quot; he ventured.;   The Mars bureau maybe?;   By now you get the ideathat this survey was totally unscientific. But what about those results? Dowomen really look at the eyes before going on to other parts of the anatomy?;  San Jose psychologist Rhawn Joseph doesn't think so.;   &quot;I think they goright for the penis,&quot; said Joseph, who has studied why people are sexuallyattracted to each other. &quot;I would think like 70 percent of women's eyes aregoing to dart down there.&quot;;   Palo Alto sex therapist Marty Klein disagreed.He's sure women look at &quot;the eyes and the butt -- trust me&quot; and guesses thesurvey was put together by a man. Just look at that question on what turnswomen off.;   &quot;This guy did not present any real choices,&quot; Klein said.&quot;Where's a hairy back? A small wallet?&quot;;   We wondered about the results,too.;   So we asked 50 women at Valley Fair Shopping Center Tuesday afternoon-- from college age on up -- to fill out the survey. Apart from being in aquandary over how to react to a photo of a nude man -- many of them refused toanswer without knowing exactly which man we were referring to -- they haddefinite preferences and favorite parts.
