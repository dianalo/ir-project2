Short interest in the largest and most frequently tradedOTC stocks edged up 0.4%, only slightly reversing courseafter a two-month drop from record levels reached inNovember.</LP><TEXT>   Combined short interest for large and small OTC issues was321.7 million shares, a 4.3% increase but still below therecord 342.5 million reached in the period ended inmid-November.   Short sellers hope to profit by borrowing stock to sell,betting that the stock's price will decline and they can buythe shares back later at a lower price to return to thelender. Short interest is the number of shares that haven'tyet been purchased for return to lenders.   The National Association of Securities Dealers, theself-regulatory body that operates the Nasdaq computerizedsystem on which more than 4,300 OTC issues trade, compilesshort-interest data in two categories: the approximatelytwo-thirds, and generally biggest, Nasdaq stocks that tradeon the National Market System; and the other, generallysmaller, stocks that don't.   &quot;Investors appear to be rationally shunning the smalleststocks&quot; in favor of larger OTC issues that are easier totrade, said analyst Mary Farrell of PaineWebber Inc. Thisyear's small-stock rally has been led by larger and&quot;middle-market&quot; OTC issues, she said, because many of thosestocks still appear cheap but have enough shares outstandingso that investors can buy them without driving prices upsharply.   Still, Ms. Farrell said she was surprised by the overallincrease in OTC short interest. &quot;The only thing I canconclude is that you have nonbelievers that the economy willturn around and nonbelievers in the small-stock turnaround,&quot;she said.   First Executive again had the largest short interestposition, at more than 4.9 million shares, an increase of188,250 shares. The Los Angeles-based insurer, heavilyburdened with a portfolio of junk bonds, recently said itexpects to report a &quot;material&quot; loss for the fourth quarterand for all of 1990. However, First Executive and itsnoteholders and banks have completed a restructuring of itssenior debt.   Oracle Systems, a Redwood City, Calif., maker of softwarefor managing databases, had the largest volume increase inshort interest with a nearly 55% climb to 2.7 million shares.In mid-January, Oracle told the Securities and ExchangeCommission that its banks had cut their credit line to $170million from $250 million for the quarter ended in November,pending a detailed review of accounts receivable.   Among other computer-related companies, Electronic Arts,Mips Computer and Intel posted increases of 650,000 shares ormore. Adobe Systems, on the other hand, posted the largestdecrease, with a 24% fall to 2.9 million shares.   Although a substantial short position reflects heavyspeculation that a stock's price will decline, some investorsconsider an increase in short interest bullish because theborrowed shares eventually must be bought back.   Some short interest doesn't reflect any opinion on thestock at all but shows up as part of another strategy, suchas arbitrage or dividend capture.   The NASD said that short interest in 2,272 Nasdaq NationalMarket System securities as of mid-February was 279,234,169shares, up from 278,055,130 shares in 2,209 issues a monthearlier.   Short interest in 1,203 smaller Nasdaq stocks jumped to42,471,400 shares from 30,462,034 in 1,122 stocks inmid-January.   The National Market System's short-interest ratio atmid-February fell to 2.22 from 3.05 a month earlier, whilethe short-interest ratio for other OTC issues rose to 1.62from 1.25 a month earlier.   The ratio -- the number of trading days, at the market'saverage volume, that would be required to convert the totalshort interest position -- is a measure of negative tradersentiment. Some analysts suggest, however, that the ratio hasweakened in value as an indicator because options and otherproducts can be used to hedge short positions.</TEXT></DOC>
