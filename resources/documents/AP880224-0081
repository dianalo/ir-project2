Also today, East Germany said the Soviets will begin the earlywithdrawal of its shorter-range missiles from the Communist Germannation this week.   The missiles in both countries are included in an arms controlagreement signed by the United States and the Soviet Union lastDecember in Washington under which all intermediate-range nuclearweapons in Europe will be scrapped.   The Rude Pravo newspaper stressed that the missiles are beingtaken out of Czechoslovakia before the treaty is ratified by theU.S. Congress.   Word that Soviet missiles will be removed from Czechoslovakiacoincided with national celebrations of the 40th anniversary of theCommunist takeover in Prague. The planned removal of the missileswas described by Rude Pravo as a significant gesture by the Kremlin.   ``A further expression of good will, similar to (others) made bythe Soviet Union ... is that according to an agreement withCzechoslovakia and East Germany, it will begin in the next few daysto pull out from the territory of both states the missile unitsequipped with OTR-22 missiles,'' Rude Pravo said. OTR-22 is theWarsaw Pact name for the shorter-range missiles NATO calls SS-12.Czechoslovakia has never said how many Soviet missiles wereinstalled on its territory. The only location ever given for theweapons was a military base near Hranice, 180 miles southeast ofPrague.   In 1983, NATO began installing U.S. cruise and Pershing 2missiles in Western Europe to counteract Soviet missiles pointed atthe West. The Kremlin responded by moving some SS-12 missiles fromtheir bases in the Soviet Union to East Germany and Czechoslovakia,to put them within striking range of the West.   Meanwhile, the East German Mission in Bonn said today in a briefstatement: ``Withdrawal of the Soviet shorter-range missiles fromthe German Democratic Republic will begin'' Thursday. The statementsaid missiles would be removed that day from two East German sites_ Bischofswerda and Waren.   East Germany announced last week that SS-12s had beendismantled, put into crates and were ready for transport back tothe Soviet Union. But it did not announced until today when themissiles would be taken out of the country.   East German leader Erich Honecker in January indicated thatSoviet nuclear missiles in Europe could be removed ahead ofschedule.   According to figures released after the superpower arms treatywas signed, there are 54 SS-12s in East Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
