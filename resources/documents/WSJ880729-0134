Du Pont created a big stir when it announced the phase-out in March, but it didn't make public its timetable for accomplishing the goal. Now the Wilmington, Del.-based chemical and energy concern says it will commercialize alternatives to the widely used chemicals, chlorofluorocarbons, starting in 1990. Du Pont plans to start its first commercial-scale manufacturing facility for two of the substitutes as early as this fall.    Replacing the chemicals, also known as CFCs, is considered a big job, because the world is dependent on them for a wide variety of uses, including plastic foam, cleaning agents and refrigerants. While a number of countries have agreed to reduce production, Du Pont's plans for a complete phase-out caught the industry and environmentalists by surprise. Du Pont is the world's largest producer of CFCs and markets them under the trade name Freon. Pennwalt Corp., the third-largest producer, is the only other concern to have followed Du Pont's call for a complete phase-out. Pennwalt, however, hasn't announced a timetable. Allied-Signal Inc., the second-largest producer, said yesterday it is seeking substitutes.    Joseph P. Glas, director of Du Pont's Freon division, said he is &quot;disappointed&quot; more producers &quot;haven't come on board&quot; with phase-out plans. Du Pont, he said, has decided to move more aggressively than it initially planned in order to fulfill its promise of an orderly phase-out and to allay concerns about societal disruptions from shortages of products.    Richard Barnett, chairman of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy, which represents producers and users of CFCs, said he hopes Du Pont's customers can change processes quickly enough to keep up with the scheduled phase-out.    Stephen O. Anderson, an ozone specialist with the Environmental Protection Agency, said Du Pont's plans &quot;reflect optimism for alternatives. It adds to confidence that alternatives are available.&quot;    Du Pont said it will spend more than $30 million this year, twice the previously announced amount, on process development, market research, applications testing and small-lot production of alternatives. An even larger sum will be spent next year, according to Mr. Glas.    The first commercial production startup is for two blowing agents used in a variety of insulation and cushioning applications. Du Pont will convert an existing manufacturing facility in Montague, Mich., to make &quot;multimillions&quot; of pounds of the alternatives, known as HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b.    Hitches in Du Pont's schedule for the total phase-out could develop if customers can't convert equipment and products to match the new materials, or if some of the products don't meet toxicity guidelines, said Mr. Glas. He estimated that customers will need about five years for conversion, and said the company is working with those customers. He added that toxicity testing is underway.    The new products are considered less than 5% as harmful to the ozone layer as CFCs, Du Pont said. CFCs are considered dangerous because it is thought that they are eating away the earth's protective shield that screens out harmful ultraviolet rays. The rays cause health and environmental problems. </TEXT></DOC>
