Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, testifying before theHouse of Representatives' Finance Committee yesterday,renewed his plea to the nation's Big Four securities firmsthat they themselves reveal voluntarily the names of clientswho were compensated, indicating that the ministry is growingweary of continued public criticism over the affair.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Hashimoto said that the ministry &quot;as an administrativeauthority . . . can't endure that the contents of the scandalremain unclear.&quot; He repeated his refusal to reveal the names,however, citing confidentiality agreements between securitiesfirms and the ministry.   In addition, the finance minister said that he hadconsidered quitting to take responsibility for the scandal.   &quot;Quitting would look most impressive, but that won't solvethe problem,&quot; he said. Mr. Hashimoto took a self-imposed 10%paycut for three months after the scandal surfaced.   The Big Four firms -- Nomura Securities Co., DaiwaSecurities Co., Nikko Securities Co. and Yamaichi SecuritiesCo. -- confirmed earlier this week that they paid a total of128.3 billion yen (at a current rate of $933 million) incompensation to more than 200 clients who suffered investmentlosses in the stock market. The payments were made over a 21/2-year period ended March 31, 1990. The Finance Ministryalso has said smaller brokerages did the same. Japan'ssecurities law allows securities firms to make compensationpayments, but it prohibits the promising of such payments.Nevertheless, the Finance Ministry in December 1989 issued adirective warning securities firms from even making thepayments. Mr. Hashimoto said yesterday that the ministry ispreparing new legislation that would make it illegal forsecurities firms to pay any compensation to clients for theirsecurities investment loses.   Nobuhiko Matsuno, director general of the FinanceMinistry's Securities Bureau, said that the single biggestcompensation payment made was 4.9 billion yen. He added thatamong the list of recipients are an unspecified number offinancial institutions.   Mr. Matsuno, also refused in his testimony yesterday toidentify the corporations who received compensation. But hesaid the ministry will try to make a list of the companies ona industry-by-industry basis for public disclosure. Hesidestepped questions on whether any politician is includedon the list of compensated clients, saying &quot;I'm not in aposition to respond with confidence.&quot;   Separately, officials from the finance ministry'ssecurities bureau, at a briefing to introduce newly appointedVice Minister for International Affairs Tadao Chino,acknowledged that the list of those compensated by thesecurities firms for investment losses includes the names ofsome wealthy individuals as well as corporations.   The officials said the ministry has known the identitiesof those companies since March 1990. But yesterday was thefirst time they publicly confirmed that individuals alsoreceived payments. The officials declined, however, toidentify the individuals or specify their number.   At the 7 1/2-hour Diet hearing, Mr. Matsuno also told thecommittee members that six second-tier brokerage firms alsomade compensation payments totaling 35 billion yen toclients. Japanese papers reported over the weekend thatseveral smaller firms had made such payments. One such firm,New Japan Securities Co., confirmed it had made payments, butwould not comment on the amount.   Mr. Matsuno said the six firms, which he would notidentify, will identify themselves soon.   As for the new legislation, Mr. Hashimoto said theministry plans to submit a bill to the extraordinary Dietsession set to begin next month. He added that the ministryis also studying the possibility of adding to the country'ssecurities exchange law a clause that specifically statesthat investors take responsibility for their own investments.   The compensation payments scandal has already led to theresignations of the presidents of Nomura and Nikko. Inaddition, Nomura's chairman resigned Monday. Both securitiesfirms are also embroiled in a scandal stemming from businessdealings with the former leader of a major Japanese crimesyndicate.   In a sign of continued criticism likely to follow,Nobutaka Tsutsui, a member of the opposition SocialDemocratic Party of Japan who sits on the finance committee,said he was disappointed in the hearing. &quot;I would like tomake the next Diet session a securities session,&quot; he said ina television interview last night, referring to next month'sextraordinary Diet session.   ---   Clay Chandler contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
