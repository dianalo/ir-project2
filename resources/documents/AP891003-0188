Kemp, in his first news conference as secretary, also announcedthat HUD has barred from doing government business a mortgagelender whose defaults in a HUD program total more than $700 million.   While praising the congressional investigation of influencepeddling, fraud and mismanagement at HUD during the Reaganadministration, Kemp said he did not believe it was necessary toappoint a special prosecutor, as suggested by some Republicans andDemocrats involved in the reviews.   Kemp's proposed changes range from regulatory and administrativesteps he can take immediately to more complex changes that wouldrequire congressional approval.   The agency's Federal Housing Administration and itsmultibillion-dollar loan programs would be significantly affected,with several programs Kemp said have deviated from helping theneedy eliminated outright.   And the entire agency would be subjected to intense publicscrutiny through the publishing of all funding and other majordecisions in the Federal Register. Kemp also promised to improvetargeting of scarce HUD funds to those most in need and vowed totry to collect money bilked from the agency in the past.   More proposals are likely, he said, after additional reviews ofHUD management.   Initial reaction from members of Congress was favorable,although there was opposition to what some lawmakers interpreted asa Kemp effort to kill the Section 8 Moderate RehabilitationProgram, which HUD's inspector general said in April was riddledwith influence peddling by former agency officials and prominentRepublican consultants. Kemp did not directly propose killing theprogram but referred to its problems and said its goals could beaccomplished through several other HUD programs.   ``I think the secretary's recommendations with respect toethics, management reform, tighter fiscal controls, theintroduction of a chief financial officer of HUD, are allexcellent,'' said Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., the chairman of aHouse subcommittee investigation of the department.   ``When we come into the programatic field, I think we'll have tostudy those recommendations much more carefully,'' said Lantos,among a number of lawmakers who said they were not yet convincedthe rehabilitation program should be killed instead of reformed.   Many of Kemp's proposals mirror those in a largely ignored 1984General Accounting Office report to Congress, while others weremolded after more recent suggestions made in Congress to limit therole of lobbyists and consultants in government funding decisions.Still others came from Kemp aides after their own review.   Eliminated along with the ``Mod Rehab'' program would bediscretionary funds under the HUD secretary's control. ``We aretrying to get rid of the slush fund approach,'' said HUDUndersecretary Alfred DelliBovi.   HUD budgets traditionally have included a large set-aside forthe secretary's discretionary fund, and HUD and congressionalinvestigators have found several instances in which projects thathad been opposed by agency experts were funded through the account.   Kemp also proposed killing another program, HUD's Title X landdevelopment insurance, citing use of the money to build upscaleprojects such as a condominium-golf complex in California. FHAprograms for vacation home loans,   But he said he was committed to HUD's co-insurance program, todate the source of nearly $1 billion in sour loans. The programallows private lenders to approve HUD-insured mortgages and was amajor part of the Reagan administration's efforts to reduce thefederal work force by contracting business to private companies.   The company Kemp said has been barred from HUD work, DRG FundingCorp., has experienced defaults on $709 million of the $1.1 billionin HUD-insured loans it approved. The government is liable for 80percent of such mortgages.   ``The problem was not the idea,'' Kemp said. ``The problem wasin the implementation of the idea. ... These reforms are designedto make a good idea better.''   Kemp said the program would be revived with improved HUDoversight of the lenders and new certification requirements for thelenders, appraisers and others involved in handling theapplications.   Other highlights of the Kemp package include:   _Appointment of a chief financial officer for HUD and a separatecomptroller for the FHA, whose loan programs have been troubled byfraud and mismanagement believed to have cost more than $4 billion.   _Requiring all lobbyists and consultants who work on HUDproposals to register with the department and disclose their fees,which HUD could deduct from any funding awards. Kemp asked Congressto impose civil fines of up to $10,000 for violations of theregistration requirement. He also proposed similar fines for HUDemployees who disclose funding decisions prior to publicannouncements.   _Allocating up to $100 million for monitoring of HUD housing andcommunity development programs. Kemp said the department now spendsless than $25 million to track annual grants totaling nearly 10times that amount.   _Allowing HUD officials to adjust subsidy and loan amounts totake into account other benefits developers receive for buildinglow-income housing, including tax credits.   _Increasing the staff of the department's inspector general andgranting the office the power to subpoena witnesses for itsinvestigations.   _Offering incentives to low-income homeowners who gotHUD-insured mortgages to encourage them to refinance at today'slower interest rates, something Kemp said could save the government$200 million.   _Raising from 60 percent to 100 percent the amount of CommunityDevelopment Block Grant money that affluent communities must spendon projects benefiting low- and moderate-income residents.   _Requiring the FHA to be audited annually and to beginprogram-by-program accounting and regional accounting. Kemp saidthat shoddy record keeping has prevented a thorough audit of FHAfor the past 15 years, that umbrella accounting practices havefailed to detect problems in specific programs and that currentpractices do not take into account regional differences in the realestate market.</TEXT></DOC>
