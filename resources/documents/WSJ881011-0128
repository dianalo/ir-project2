Even now, the 31-year-old engineer confesses to being &quot;in pain for a year&quot; because of it.    His transgression? Mr. Yukimura changed jobs. While that may not sound like a big thing to Americans or Europeans, changing companies in mid-career is nothing less than revolutionary in Japan. And it's a revolution that more and more Japanese are joining. Last year about 2.7 million people, or 4.4% of the work force, jumped for greener pastures. That's up 80% from five years earlier.    &quot;It's a new tide,&quot; says Kimihisa Sato, a director of Mitsubishi Research Institute who follows management trends.    It's also a new boon for foreign companies trying to compete here. They now find it much easier to hire experienced Japanese employees, given that Japan's job market is acting more like a free market. Recently, for example, Lotus Development landed a Sony marketing whiz, LSI Logic nabbed a top NEC manager, and Daimler Benz and BMW each recruited an executive from Toyota. &quot;It's become very easy to meet foreign companies' needs,&quot; says Hiroo Takahashi, a director of Nippon Manpower Co., a recruiting firm. &quot;It's a complete change from five to 10 years ago.&quot;    For Japanese companies, though, the new labor mobility is a double-edged sword. They stand to gain more flexibility in recruiting, but they also will probably pay more in personnel costs and lose some of the group harmony that is so cherished here.    For years, management experts have trumpeted Japan's &quot;lifetime employment&quot; system -- no layoffs, but no quitting either -- as one of the secrets of the country's success. Simply put, managers and workers see themselves in the same boat, dependent on each other for survival. Japanese workers so thoroughly identify their fates with their companies' that they give up their vacations, accept unwanted transfers and work overtime (sometimes without pay), all the while peppering their bosses with suggestions on how to run the business better. In many cases, this job performance is what gives Japanese an edge over foreign competition. No one expects this system or its spirit to disappear, but job hopping will tend to undermine it.    The new trend is as much home-grown as inspired from abroad. Japan is plagued with labor shortages; thus, many companies, desperate for trained professionals, are hiring people from the competition.    Some Japanese companies also seem intent on diluting the monolithic corporate cultures that have ruled in postwar Japan. The old, group-oriented approach worked well when the objective was perfecting mass-production techniques, but many top managers think the future now puts a premium on creative corporate strategies. They figure that by bringing in mid-career managers from the outside, they can acquire fresh perspectives and, in turn, a sharper competitive edge.    Sony Corp.'s general manager for hiring and training, Nobukazu Ohga, calls it the &quot;stirring-up effect.&quot; His company last year hired about 70 mid-career switchers, accounting for about 13% of the college graduates it brought aboard. The electronics concern hopes to hire more.    &quot;If you think only of efficiency, it is better to have people who share the same value sense because they can move under a single flag,&quot; says an official of Sumitomo Trust andamp; Banking Co. &quot;But the question is if the company can adjust itself to changes in the future with pure-cultured people.&quot; Apparently having decided it can't, Sumitomo Trust is hiring professionals from the outside.    Many employees are also beginning to see advantages for themselves in mid-career job changes. For some, like Taro Kamagata, one motivation is money. The 29-year-old recently joined Mitsubishi Research Institute after he quit his junior-management job at a big printing firm. &quot;I don't think I received compensation commensurate with my contribution,&quot; he says.    But for most, the lure is job satisfaction. Take Mr. Yukimura, the 31-year-old engineer. He left the heavy-machinery company where he was working to join Sony because Sony offered him a job in the field of his dreams -- systems engineering. &quot;At my previous company, it might have taken 10 or 20 years to realize my wish, and then I would be too old,&quot; Mr. Yukimura says. &quot;I wanted to make the best use of my ability.&quot; Another professional, Yutaka Fujiwara, recently jumped from a company that builds oil rigs and joined Yasuda Trust as a merger and acquisition specialist. &quot;This idea may come from my stay in the U.S.,&quot; says Mr. Fujiwara, whose previous employer dispatched him to Houston for five years, &quot;but manpower is one of the commodities. You sell to the highest bidder.&quot;    Few Japanese, of course, make such a move lightly. Kaoru Asakawa agonized when Nissan Motor Co., attracted by Mr. Asakawa's expertise in new materials, recruited him from another company. &quot;After all, I am a Japanese,&quot; he explains, &quot;so I was in distress.&quot;    But he made the leap, and others in Japan are making it, too: One survey of recent college graduates suggests 60% might job hop. The trend is being shaped by workers in the postwar baby boom who are entering the age bracket where promotion into upper management was normal in the past but more difficult now. The bulge in the population is simply bigger than the number of available top-level jobs. Amid slower economic growth, some Japanese companies, particularly in the shipbuilding industry, also have taken to &quot;encouraging&quot; senior employees to retire. Workers are therefore sensing that the system of lifetime employment isn't what it used to be and that self-interest may be the best policy.    &quot;The relations between companies and individuals are becoming cool,&quot; says Haruyuki Kawamoto, who last summer left Toyota Motor Corp. after 16 years and joined BMW's Japanese subsidiary as an assistant senior manager. &quot;If you count on corporate paternalism, you will be a loser.&quot;    It has taken more than a little while for Japanese to come around to that way of thinking. Yasuda Trust was one of the first major Japanese banks to hire mid-career workers. Its small newspaper advertisement in 1984 seeking such help caused a sensation.    But soon others followed. Nissan started systematically hiring mid-career engineers early this year to beef up its research and development activities. Nippon Steel Corp., while cutting thousands of steel-mill jobs, is actively hiring mid-career engineers and specialists to staff the company's diversification efforts. Kirin Breweries Co., Japan's leading beer maker, now hires marketing managers who are in mid-career.    Indeed, in a recent government survey of 338 companies, 79% replied that they had hired experienced workers in the most recent year. In 1984, when the government did a similar study, the figure was a much lower 36%.    One clear loser in all the job hopping is the Japanese personnel practice of promoting group harmony and corporate loyalty. Traditionally, workers have been paid according to their level of seniority. But now, that predictable compensation program is rupturing as companies jack up the pay for employees they fear losing to other firms. There is &quot;tremendous pressure to keep competent people at the company and motivate them,&quot; says one Nissan official in charge of personnel management. Managers also fear fueling doubts and jealousies among those who stay put, particularly if workers brought in from the outside are given big salaries.    So far, companies haven't felt the effect of job hopping on their cost of compensation. But as bidding for labor becomes more common, salary inflation seems inevitable.    Already, there are early hints of it. To protect their talent from scouting and to nab specialists from other companies, some Japanese firms have adopted a new &quot;contract employee&quot; system. Under it, salaries are renegotiated annually and tied to performance -- a radical concept in Japan. Nikko Securities Co., for example, adopted the system last October, mainly for specialists like bond dealers and foreign-exchange traders. Those who work under it can earn a lot if they are talented, although there isn't any guarantee of an annual wage increase -- nor of continued employment.    Says Mr. Sato of the Mitsubishi Research Institute: &quot;The one-company-for-life era has come to an end.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
