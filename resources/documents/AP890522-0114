RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Churchfailed Monday in a Supreme Court attempt to kill a lawsuit by twoformer members who say they were ``brainwashed'' into joining thechurch.   Church officials had said the Constitution's guarantee ofreligious freedom should nullify the lawsuit. But the justicesdismissed the appeal without comment, refusing to shield the churchfrom the suit seeking damages.   In other action, the court:   _Rejected an appeal by mass murderer John Wayne Gacy, theChicago man convicted and sentenced to death in 1980 for killing 33boys and young men. No one in U.S. history has been convicted ofkilling more people.   _Ruled unanimously that a lawsuit against the owners of thecruise ship Achille Lauro, target of a terrorist hijacking in 1985,may be tried in a federal court in New York City rather than inNaples, Italy.   _Agreed to use a case from Colorado to study a federalregulation aimed at saving the government time and money when itmistakenly overpays some Social Security recipients.   _Let stand a ruling that Chicago may be sued for monetarydamages in state court by people contending officials allowedexcessive noise and air pollution at O'Hare International Airport.   _Rejected an appeal by former Chicago Councilman Thomas E.Keane, convicted of fraud for illegally conspiring to buy and selltax-delinquent properties. The court refused to use the case to setguidelines on when some people may challenge their fraudconvictions after completing prison terms for those convictions.   _Limited, by a 6-3 vote, federal judges' power to excludepotentially prejudicial evidence from civil trials. The courtallowed a jury to be told about the criminal record of a youngPennsylvania man who sued over the loss of his arm in a car washaccident.   In the Unification Church case, David Molko and Tracy Leal saidin lawsuits that they were duped into becoming ``Moonies'' inCalifornia.   Molko saud he was a 27-year-old law school graduate in 1979 whenrecruited by church members in San Francisco.   He said two men approached him at a bus stop and told him theybelonged to an international community of socially conscious people.   He went to dinner with them and thereafter to a retreat outsidethe city where he and others were kept to a tight schedule oflectures, group discussions and calisthenics, he said.   Molko said the group members repeatedly denied theirorganization was a religious one. Only on the 12th day was he toldthe group belonged to the Unification Church.   Molko said he was confused and angry but stayed on when memberspersuaded him that deception had been necessary because of thechurch's negative reputation.   Ms. Leal told a similar story in court papers. She said she wasa 19-year-old college student when a recruiter approached her at aSan Francisco bus station in 1979.   She said she was not told the group was part of the UnificationChurch until her 22nd day at the retreat.   Ms. Leal and Molko remained church members for several monthsbefore they were abducted by ``deprogrammers'' who had been hiredby their parents.   They are suing the church for punitive damages for the emotionaldistress they say they suffered. Molko also is seeking the returnof $6,000 he donated to the church.   The California Supreme Court, voting 6-1 last October, overruledtwo lower courts and reinstated the suits. It ordered jury trials.   The state court said the Molko and Ms. Leal are entitled totrials to present evidence they were ``brainwashed'' and ``thechurch's agents rendered them incapable of deciding not to join.''   The state court rejected arguments that forcing the church todefend itself against fraud allegations interferes with its rightto practice religion freely.   The National Council of Churches, other religious organizationsand a group consisting primarily of college professors had urgedthe justices to overrule the state court.   The groups had said the state court ruling ``has had, and willcontinue to have, a serious chilling effect on religiousproselytizing and conversion in California and elsewhere.''</TEXT></DOC>
