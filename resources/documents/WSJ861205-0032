The move settles an 11-year-old lawsuit against the regional telephone company's Pacific Bell unit, and marks the largest settlement ever in a U.S. gay-rights employment case, according to discrimination law experts.    Pacific Bell said the settlement didn't represent an admission that it has ever discriminated against homosexuals.    An attorney for the plaintiffs -- six individuals and two gay-rights organizations -- said he expects more than 200 people to seek damages from the fund. The attorney, Charles N. Freiberg, said Pacific Bell had a written policy until 1976 that it wouldn't hire people who were openly homosexual.    A Pacific Bell spokeswoman said that it has never been the company's practice to discriminate against homosexuals. Asked about the written policy, she said, &quot;There was something written that was not applied.&quot; She said Pacific Bell did hire homosexuals during the period in dispute in the lawsuit.    The lawsuit settlement makes the fund available to people who can demonstrate to an arbitrator that Pacific Bell discriminated against them between Jan. 1, 1970, and April 1, 1986. In the settlement, Pacific Bell also agreed to pay all past and future legal costs related to the suit, which Mr. Freiberg estimated at roughly $2 million.    Pacific Bell has had an official policy forbidding discrimination against homosexuals since 1980. </TEXT></DOC>
