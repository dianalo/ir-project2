Arias.</NOTE><BYLINE>By LAURA KING</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis took his wife home from the hospital, met withCosta Rican President Oscar Arias and got back to work at theMassachusetts Statehouse today in his first day back in Bostonafter sewing up the Democratic presidential nomination.   His presidential campaign focused on choosing a running mate.   Vice President George Bush, the all-but-certain Republicannominee, was opening his post-primary campaign with a trip toTexas, grateful for new words of support from President Reagan whosaid Wednesday he would do ``everything I can'' to help Bush win.   Dukakis, who has strongly criticized Reagan administrationpolicies in Latin America, praised Arias' peace plan for CentralAmerica and said the United States must ``develop a newrelationship based on respect'' with the region's areas.   Arias sidestepped a question about the U.S. elections, sayingonly that he would be a ``good friend of whoever you decide toelect in November.''   Dukakis then went to the hospital where his wife Kitty wasreleased six days after undergoing spinal surgery.   Mrs. Dukakis wore a neck brace and appeared to be in some pain.She said her doctors told her she could take the brace off at theDemocratic National Convention in July on the night her husbandformally accepts the nomination.   Dukakis, whose victories in the final four primaries of theseason on Tuesday gave him the delegates he needs for afirst-ballot victory at the convention, received a round of supportfrom onetime opponents on Wednesday.   Rep. Richard Gephardt, Sen. Paul Simon and former Arizona Gov.Bruce Babbitt all weighed in with endorsements Wednesday. And NewYork Gov. Mario Cuomo, the most speculated-about non-candidate ofthe year, finally lent his backing, although it wasn't exactly theflowery tribute traditionally offered on such occasions.   ``I endorse him! I endorse him! I endorse him!'' an exasperatedCuomo said after persistent questioning by reporters. ``There,three times I endorsed him.''   Even though the nomination is numerically his, Dukakis is stillengaged in a duel of sorts with Jesse Jackson, the second-placefinisher in the primary sweepstakes.   Jackson says he'll continue his campaign up until theconvention. And he has put Dukakis on notice that he wants to beoffered the No. 2 spot on the ticket.   The Massachusetts governor has said he'll consider Jackson as apossible running mate. But Jackson says consideration alone won'tdo it.   ``Consideration means an offer. It does not mean just inpassing,'' he said Wednesday. ``The vice presidency is not the topbut it is a long way from where I started.''   Dukakis kept to what has become his stock line on the subject _that Jackson himself has said it's the nominee's decision to make.   ``I'm going to cast my net far and wide,'' he said, adding thathe hoped to have ``a very good idea'' prior to next month'sconvention of whom he wants for a running mate.   Jackson was spending a few days at a California resort, restingand talking to advisers. He waged a grueling primary campaign,seldom missing a day of stumping.   Bush, on the other hand, was heading back out on the trailtoday. He was traveling to Houston, where he was to address theTexas state GOP convention.   Like Dukakis, Bush was seeing former rivals line up behind him.Three of them _ Bob Dole, Rep. Jack Kemp and television evangelistPat Robertson _ were joining him on Friday at a ``Unity '88''conference in Denver.   On Wednesday, Bush met with Reagan, who pledged afterward hewould campaign hard for his vice president and do ``everything Ican'' to keep the White House in Republican hands.   ``George, wait until you and I get out there on the trail, andstart pinning him (Dukakis) down on things he claims, which we knoware not true,'' the president said.   As Bush has been doing in recent days, Reagan accused theDemocrats of being too pessimistic.   If he listened to Dukakis, the president said, ``I would beconvinced that we're in an economic downturn, and that people arehomeless, and that people are going without food and medicalattention, and that we've got to do something about theunemployed.''   Dukakis responded, ``Good jobs and affordable housing and healthinsurance for working families are what the American dream is allabout.''   ``We can do a lot better than we've been doing to make thatdream come true for every citizen in the land,'' the governor saidin a statement released by his campaign.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked today aboutReagan's remark, said, ``The president believes the homeless is avery serious problem, but what he was saying yesterday is thatDukakis is the prophet of doom and gloom and always uses thehomeless as an example of how everything is going wrong inAmerica.''   Bush has been saying he is unworried by recent polls suggestinghe trails Dukakis. He insists he relishes the underdog's role.</TEXT></DOC>
