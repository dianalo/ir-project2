In another development, an explosion aboard a train late Mondaykilled 20 people and seriously injured 11 in the suburbs ofShanghai, an offical of the Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office reported.   The official Xinhua News Agency said an on-the-spot investigationshowed the explosion was caused by dynamite. The Shanghai officialon Tuesday called it an accident and said it happened at 11.13 p.m.Monday in Songjiang county, 18{ miles southwest of Shanghai.   He said the train was bound from Hangzhou to Shanghai and thatthe explosion occurred in a seated compartment less than an hourbefore it was scheduled to reach its destination, but that he had nofurther details.   He said an undetermined unknown number of passengers also wereslightly injured.   Japan's Kyodo News Service said the explosion occurred in atoilet.   On the political scene on Monday, the official press said theCommunist Party was prepared to expel members who participated inthe student-led movement for a freer China, suggesting a full-scalepurge following Saturday's announcement that moderate party chiefZhao Ziyang had been ousted from his party posts.   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said two Americans _ a teacher and astudent at Nankai University in nearby Tianjin _ were ordered toleave China by Friday.   Teacher Mark Radicia and student Helen Qubain were being expelledbecause ``evidently they were very involved in the studentmovement,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The two,whose ages and hometowns were not available, were questioned bysecurity forces, he said.   A U.S. official said Monday in Washington that a group of 11Americans who went to China against State Department travel advicewere charged by police in Kunming with distributing religiousliterature and ordered to remain in the city.   The Americans' names and hometowns were not disclosed. Theofficial, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a U.S. diplomatwas bound for Kunming from Chengdu to look into the situation. Hesaid the charge evidently was not a serious offense.   Li Zhiyun, one of the commanders of the June 3-4 military assaulton Beijing, said he had ``no regrets'' about what Chinese andforeign witnesses have said was a massacre of unarmed residents andstudents.   Li, speaking to foreign reporters invited to tour TiananmenSquare, stressed the government line that no shots were fired atstudents during the assault to remove thousands of student activistsfrom the square.   ``The whole process was non-violent. No one used guns,'' he said.   Li said troops shot into the air once, when ``thugs'' occupying abuilding to the southeast of the square opened fire, wounding onesoldier.   He acknowledged some innocent people ``may have been wounded''when troops fought to reach the square, but said people were warnednot to go out that night.   ``When our troops moved to the square we received persistentresistance,'' Li said. ``Individuals even used guns to kill ourwarriors. We were forced to defend ourselves. This group of peoplegot what they deserved.''   The government puts the death toll from the assault at about 300and says most were soldiers who were attacked by mobs. Chinesewitnesses and Western intelligence reports say up to 3,000 peoplewere shot to death or crushed by tanks as the military stormed thecity.   During a tour of the square, he said black burn patches on thepavement were caused by students who set fire to tents to stop thetroop advance. He called stories that troops had burned the bodiesof students were ``totally untrue.''   The monument was decorated with banners reading ``carry on thewill of the revolutionary martyrs'' _ a reference to soldiers killedduring the attack _ and ``promote the glorious traditions of thetroops.''   Bushes and grass around the monument had been replanted, andnewly planted flowers bloomed in boxes between the monument and themausoleum where Mao Tse-tung's body lies in state.   Li said the troops ``returned the square to the people'' butcould not say when it would be reopened to the public. He said armed``thugs'' were at large.   About 1,800 people, including up to 500 in Beijing, have beenarrested nationwide since the crackdown in Beijing promptedwidespread disturbances.   The party Central Committee on Saturday announced that Zhao, apioneer of China's past decade of economic reform, was stripped ofall party posts for ``supporting the turmoils and splitting theparty.''   Shanghai's Wen Hui Bao daily newspaper said 14 members of the``Wild Geese Suicide Squad,'' one of many groups of young workerswho joined street protests, were sentenced to up to 13 years forslashing car tires, beating drivers and blocking traffic. The reportwas seen in Beijing on Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
