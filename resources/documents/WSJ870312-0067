Matthew Lyon of Vermont was known as the &quot;Spitting Lyon.&quot; He earned the nickname after spitting in the face of Rep. Roger Griswold of Connecticut.    Some years later, during the red-hot passions that led to the Civil War, Rep. P.S. &quot;Bully&quot; Brooks of South Carolina took issue with a speech by Sen. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, who characterized advocates of slavery as &quot;hirelings picked from the drunken spew and vomit of an uneasy civilization.&quot; On May 22, 1856, Rep. Brooks assaulted Sen. Sumner on the Senate floor, caning him until the Bay State lawmaker fell to the floor, bloody and unconscious. Mr. Sumner's injuries forced him to leave his seat for nearly four years. Mr. Brooks resigned in July 1856 but was reelected the following month to fill the vacancy caused by his resignation.    Today's congressional rows are models of courtesy by comparison. Last month, tempers flared on the Senate floor over an obscure regulatory bill that President Reagan opposed. Standing up for the administration's point of view, Vice President George Bush engaged in a debate with Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd over &quot;fair play.&quot; However, debate or not, the senator addressed the vice president as &quot;the distinguished presiding officer,&quot; and the vice president acknowledged &quot;the courtesy of the distinguished majority leader.&quot;    Lawmakers long have used nice talk to camouflage not-so-nice thoughts, and it is almost a rule of thumb that whenever a legislator refers to another as a &quot;distinguished colleague,&quot; he is rooting hard for his defeat in the next election. </TEXT></DOC>
