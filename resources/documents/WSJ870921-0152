Bork,&quot; the Journal lumps People For the American Way together with &quot;all the other independent duchies of the balkanized Democratic Party.&quot;    The fact is, we aren't an &quot;independent duchy&quot; of the Democratic Party -- or any other party. We're independent, period. Our leadership, membership and staff consists of Republicans (including me), Democrats and independents. What unites us is a shared commitment to defending constitutional liberties, particularly those guaranteed by the First Amendment. This is the non-partisan standard by which we judge issues, such as the Bork nomination.    As a Lincoln Republican elected to Congress eight times from Alabama, I'm used to being called every name in the book. This may be the first time someone has suggested I'm a Democrat.
