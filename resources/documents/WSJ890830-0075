After 16 trouble-prone years of uninspiring growth, Taiyo Kobe Bank stunned competitors Tuesday by announcing that it would try another merger.    This time the world is watching. In what will be the biggest bank combination ever, Mitsui Bank and slightly smaller Taiyo Kobe have agreed to join operations beginning April 1 in an all-stock deal that will give Taiyo Kobe investors eight Mitsui shares for every 10 Taiyo Kobe shares they hold. Holders will be asked to approve the merger at special meetings in December.    The new bank, for now called Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank in English, will be the world's second-largest financial institution, with assets amounting to more than 53 trillion yen ($368.92 billion). Only Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, itself the product of a 1971 merger, is larger, with assets of 54.28 trillion yen as of March 31.    Both banks have something to gain in the merger. Taiyo Kobe, a retail-weighted bank with a huge domestic branch network, gets a firmer foothold in capital markets and international banking after its involvement in an embarrassing corporate scandal two years ago. Mitsui, the centerpiece of Japan's oldest industrial group, can expand consumer lending and fulfill a longtime wish to regain the top ranking it lost in 1945 because of its support for Japan's failed war effort.    &quot;This is a very complementary merger,&quot; declared Mitsui's president, Kenichi Suematsu, at a Tokyo news conference with Taiyo Kobe's president, Yasuo Matsushita. Mr. Suematsu, who initiated the merger talks in March, will become president of the new bank. Mr. Matsushita will become the new bank's chairman.    The announcement of the Mitsui-Taiyo Kobe merger reflects the evolution of Japan's banking industry into new areas, such as consumer lending and wholesale banking, and away from others, such as corporate lending.    While some skeptical analysts and bankers foresee rocky times for the new bank, most agree that the merger signals intensifying competitiveness among Japanese banks. And they predict the consequences of the transformation will be felt around the globe.    &quot;This one merger will produce a collosal new bank,&quot; says J. Brian Waterhouse, a senior analyst at James Capel andamp; Co., a British securities firm. The new bank will have Japan's largest domestic branch network and be present in all the world's major financial centers -- a crucial factor considering that many Japanese banks now permit their overseas offices to make loans amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars without headquarters approval.    Many Japanese bankers these days talk frequently of a &quot;survival theory,&quot; which holds that only a handful of major Japanese banks will be able to survive and compete globally. Those are the banks with large enough capital resources to do business around the world, whether lending or in capital markets. The rest are likely to remain purely domestic players.    In apparent acknowledgement of the desirability of big bank mergers, the president of the Federation of Bankers' Associations, Dai-Ichi Kangyo President Kuniji Miyazaki, praised Mitsui and Taiyo Kobe for their &quot;courageous decision&quot; to merge.    Though the bigger-is-better logic for fusing two banks into a larger one hasn't changed much since the days of Taiyo Kobe's birth, the stakes clearly have. Thanks to the rapid growth of Japan's economy and the sharp appreciation of the yen in recent years, this country's banks have become the world's financial titans.    By most measures, the 10 biggest banks in the world are Japanese. The largest, Dai-Ichi Kangyo, is three times as big as Chase Manhattan Corp. in total assets. The 1.38 trillion-yen capitalization of Japan's No. 2 Fuji Bank is one-fifth larger than that of Citicorp, America's largest bank. Last year alone, the combined assets of Mitsui and Taiyo Kobe grew more than Bank of Boston's total assets.    Size has its drawbacks, of course. Many analysts, for instance, are dubious that the Mitsui-Taiyo Kobe merger will go smoothly because the combined bank may be too big to manage.    The new bank will have nearly 23,000 employees, about 600 branches in Japan and a score overseas, and a deposit base of 39.6 trillion yen -- also just behind Dai-Ichi Kangyo, which had deposits of 41.2 trillion yen at the end of March. The new bank will have a total of 66 directors.    Size problems have dogged Dai-Ichi Kangyo since its merger nearly 20 years ago. Even today, outsiders who work with the bank often discover that requests for information get lost or, more peculiarly, must be approved by two camps of managers -- those from the old Dai-Ichi Bank and those from the old Kangyo Bank.    One of the major objectives of any merger is to produce economies of scale, and analysts say the sheer magnitude of the Mitsui-Taiyo Kobe merger makes it unlikely that much can be accomplished soon, even if employees get along. Only in areas such as computerization, where Japanese banks considerably lag their international competitors, will the merger have an immediate benefit, analysts say.    Worries about the merger prompted Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. to put the credit rating of Mitsui Bank's commercial paper on its CreditWatch list with negative implications. It put Taiyo Kobe's senior debt rating on the list with positive implications, noting that the bank's weak performance in recent years could be helped by the merger. Still, the agency said, &quot;successful consolidations of the two banks' operations will be a formidable task.&quot;    Already, there are signs that all aspects of the merger will have to be discussed. The new bank's name, for instance, officially will be Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank in English, but will be Taiyo Kobe Mitsui Bank in Japanese, until a new name is found, sometime in the next three years. For Mitsui, which had been Japan's biggest bank before the war, losing its identity obviously is painful, even though it initiated the search for a partner.    Efficiency is becoming more important for Japanese banks in part because of deregulation. Authorities in Japan have been eliminating the cozy, fixed interest-rate structure that pretty much has guaranteed banks a steady if thin profit margin in the years since the war. To increase profits, banks simply boosted lending. Within the past two years, though, the proportion of loans and deposits that carry floating interest rates and don't offer banks a guaranteed profit margin has soared to more than half of all bank business. Besides, many big corporations now can raise money directly from the capital markets; Toyota Motor Corp., one of Mitsui's big clients, has even said it no longer needs banks.    At the same time, recently introduced rules that will require banks to keep a certain amount of cash on hand for every loan they make are discouraging banks from lending money. Those rules, prepared by the Bank for International Settlements, will go into full effect in March 1993, but they already are prompting Japanese banks to trim their lending, especially to corporations.    The only way to avoid constraining lending is to raise money. Japanese banks have been very successful at accumulating capital; in 1988, they raised a total of 3.73 trillion yen, mainly to meet BIS rules.    Even if banks can keep up with the capital rules, they increasingly are forced to look at ways to increase the margins they earn on loans. &quot;Quantity will not be the first priority here any more,&quot; a top strategic planner at Dai-Ichi Kangyo said in a recent interview. &quot;Quality will be.&quot;    By quality, he means the amount that a bank can earn on a loan. The highest margins now are on loans to individuals and small businesses, which typically offer profit margins of at least one percentage point more than corporate lending. And consumer lending is booming, accounting for more than 60% of all loans in Japan today. At Mitsubishi Bank, a big rival of Mitsui's, consumer lending now accounts for almost all new loans.    The Mitsui-Taiyo Kobe combination may well be Japan's leader in this kind of lending. With its huge branch network -- it will have a third more offices than Dai-Ichi Kangyo -- the new bank will have better access to small borrowers. And because one-third of its branches are in Tokyo, it will be able to take advantage of another fact: More than half of all consumer lending originates in the capital.    The increase in consumer lending hasn't quite kept pace with the decrease in corporate lending, though. The result has been a decline in income from lending. This interest income now only accounts for about three-quarters of bank earnings in Japan, down from 90% five years ago.    ---   Masayoshi Kanabayashi contributed to this article.    ---@ Japan's Top Commercial Banks    Ranking by total unconsolidated assets as of March 31, 1989.
