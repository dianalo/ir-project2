Justice Thomas Galligan's instructions came in response to arequest for clarification from the jury during its first day ofdeliberations Thursday. Jurors resumed deliberations in the rapeand attempted murder case shortly after 10 a.m. today.   ``The fact that a parent was not present during the questioningof a juvenile does not automatically mean the statement isinvoluntary,'' the judge said.   Peter Rivera, 15-year-old Raymond Santana's lawyer, had arguedthat Santana's incriminating statements were no good because hisgrandmother, who spoke little English, was the only adult with himduring questioning.   ``The attack on the confession was our central issue. Thejudge's instructions hurt my case,'' Rivera said Thursday.   Santana, Yusef Salaam, 16, and Antron McCray, 16, are chargedwith attacking a jogger in Central Park in April 1989. They weretried in an adult court as juveniles, meaning a conviction wouldbring limited prison terms.   Prosecutors said the jogger was dragged into the woods,gang-raped, bashed with a brick and pipe and left to die in a poolof blood. She is back at work as an investment banker but hersight, balance and smell are impaired.   The savagery of the attack and her extraordinary recoverycaptured the attention of the city and the nation.</TEXT></DOC>
