Boesky may testify in forthcoming London court proceedings concerning Guinness PLC's $4.3 billion 1986 takeover of Distillers Co., people in the U.S. and Britain who are close to the case said.    Whether Mr. Boesky testifies in Britain will depend on what he can get in return for his cooperation, said the same people, who indicated no agreement has yet been reached between Mr. Boesky and the British authorities.    British government officials are investigating an alleged illegal scheme to support the price of Guinness's shares during its takeover of Distillers. Cases arising from this investigation are expected to come to court in the next several months.    It's likely that any testimony Mr. Boesky gives British investigators would center on the roles played in the bid for Distillers by former Guinness Chairman Ernest Saunders and his main financial adviser in the takeover, former Morgan Grenfell acquisitions specialist Roger Seelig. Mr. Boesky was close to Guinness, which last year invested $100 million in an investment fund controlled by him. Guinness this year sued in New York to recover that money.    According to a report in Britain's Observer newspaper published yesterday, Mr. Boesky is prepared to offer British investigators information about the roles played by key individuals in the case, including Mr. Saunders, Mr. Seelig, David Mayhew, a partner in the stock brokerage Cazenove andamp; Co., and Washington-based lawyer Thomas Ward, an associate of Mr. Saunders and a former Guinness director. Cazenove acted as brokers to Guinness during its bid for Distillers.    The British newspaper report also said Mr. Boesky has offered U.K. investigators information on three other British takeovers, which it didn't name.    Messrs. Saunders, Seelig, Mayhew and Ward couldn't be reached for comment yesterday. Lawyers at Wilmer Cutler andamp; Pickering, a Washington-based law firm that represents Mr. Boesky, couldn't be reached for comment yesterday. When asked, Mr. Boesky's New York lawyers, Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver andamp; Jacobson, declined to comment.    Evidence provided by Mr. Boesky to the U.S. authorities -- which was passed on to Britain -- was crucial to the initiation of the British investigation of Guinness's bid for Distillers Co., individuals in the U.S. and Britain said. It is therefore logical that he may testify in any court action concerning Guinness's controversial bid, they added. In the past year, there has been increasing cooperation between the U.S. and British authorities in investigating alleged securities markets abuses.    In London, spokesmen at the Department of Trade andamp; Industry and at police headquarters at New Scotland Yard both declined to comment in reply to inquiries by this newspaper relating to Mr. Boesky and the Guinness investigation. Under British law, the DTI investigates alleged irregularities in the securities markets. If it finds sufficient evidence, the DTI passes the case on to the director of public prosecutions, who decides whether to prosecute. The director of public prosecutions couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.    Mr. Boesky, who April 23 pleaded guilty in federal court in New York to conspiring to make false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission, is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 9. But because Mr. Boesky's cooperation with the U.S. government is integral to other pending U.S. insider-trading cases, it's likely his sentencing will be postponed. Mr. Boesky faces a maximum of five years in jail and $250,000 in fines for the criminal violation to which he pleaded guilty. By giving up $100 million in assets, Mr. Boesky also settled related civil SEC charges. </TEXT></DOC>
