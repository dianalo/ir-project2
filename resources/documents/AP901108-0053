The minister, Latif Nassayif Jassim, was reacting to the newSaudi-U.S. agreement on the command structure for joint militaryaction.   The agency quoted him as saying:   ``We will retaliate on any American aggression against Iraq, andall the allies of the American forces in Saudi Arabia will be ourtarget.''   More than 300,000 troops have massed in the kingdom to stand upto Iraq after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. They include some230,000 Americans.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III reached agreement withSaudi leaders earlier this week that in the event of militaryaction against Iraq, U.S. officers would command their own troops.   A joint U.S.-Saudi command would be retained in the event of anIraqi incursion into the kingdom.   ``This agreement confirms the plot which we warned of before,the real agressive and imperialist aims of the American and Westernpresence in Saudi Arabia, and exposes Saudi Arabian-American claimsand lies that Iraq is threatening Saudi Arabia,'' Jassim was quotedas saying.   ``We repeated many times that there are no Iraqi threats toSaudi Arabia.'' Jassim said that if an attack is launched on Iraqiforces from Saudi Arabia ``We will make all Saudi lands where theseforeign forces are now stationed a battlefield,'' INA reported.</TEXT></DOC>
