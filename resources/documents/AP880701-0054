The day was proclaimed by the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians onPopulation and Development to draw attention to Asia reaching apopulation of 3 billion this year.   Speaker after speaker stood up at the Great Hall of the Peoplein central Beijing to warn that rapid population growth poses athreat to economic development.   ``We cannot think that we can have more children because ofeconomic development ... nor can we relax our efforts because ofprogress in family planning,'' said Hu Keshi, forum vice chairman.   China has limited most families to one child since the early1980s in an attempt to keep its population, now 1.08 billion, fromexceeding 1.2 billion at the turn of the century.   But the limit has been widely flouted in the past two years andofficials now tacitly acknowledge that ceiling will be exceeded.   After several years in which the population grew by 1.1 percentannually, it soared in 1986 and 1987 to 1.4 percent as a return tofamily farming and private enterprise inadvertently encouragedcouples to have more children as potential sources of income.   Another reason for the baby boom is that 360 million childrenborn during the last boom, from 1962 to 1975, have reachedchild-bearing age, Peng Peiyun, head of the State Family PlanningCommission, told the gathering.   She described China's population problem as severe and said,``We must take a firm hand ... and never slacken our efforts.''   Premier Li Peng delivered the same message in a speech onnational television and radio Thursday night, but noted the taskwill not be easy and ``population problems cannot be solved withina short period of time.''   Officials have responded to the baby boom by intensifying familyplanning propaganda, announcing punishments for local officialswhose districts exceed their birth quotas and rewarding successfulofficials.   At today's ceremony, 18 family planning workers, doctors andrepresentatives of local districts were given radio-cassetteplayers for ``outstanding performance in implementing ourpopulation policy.''   None of the speakers mentioned a growing phenomenon reportedThursday in the official media in which families and districtofficials fail to register babies that exceed the local quotas,rendering them official non-persons. Such children lack residencepermits and cannot register for school or receive government rationcards for rice and edible oil.   Aprodicio Laquian, a representative of the U.N. Fund forPopulation Activities in Beijing, said one reason for the boom isthat local governments often lack the funds to give couplespromised incentives for having only one child.   The pull of tradition also is strong, and many women whose firstchild is a girl have a second in hopes of bearing a son to carry onthe family line.   But in a speech at the ceremony, Laquian said China's effortsshould be a lesson to other Asian countries with higher growthrates, such as Bangladesh at 2.61 percent and Indonesia at 1.74percent.   He said India, growing at 1.72 percent per year, likely willsurpass China as the world's most populous country by the year 2050.</TEXT></DOC>
