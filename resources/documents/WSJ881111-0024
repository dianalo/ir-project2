Yesterday, specialty steelmaker Allegheny Ludlum declared a special $3.50-a-share dividend, marking the latest of a series of moves by metals companies to reward stockholders. Allegheny shares jumped 2 1/4 to finish at 34 1/4.    Recently, analysts have become mesmerized by the vast cash flows being thrown off by steel, aluminum, nickel and copper companies that only a few years ago were ailing. Even in a recession, they say, cash flows should hold up better than in the past because the industry has revamped its operations.    Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette analyst John Tumazos introduces the prospect that some metals companies may be &quot;tempting takeover targets&quot; or buy-out candidates, though talk in Washington about tax penalties for buy-outs makes them seem less likely. He thinks more metals companies are going to pay out special dividends, buy back stock or raise their regular dividends.    &quot;There has to be a long-term dividend policy reflecting the change&quot; in metals companies' fortunes, says First Boston analyst Peter Anker.    Currently, Alcan Aluminium, Aluminum Co. of America and Inco each are piling up $2 million to $3 million of spare cash flow a day, enough to pay all their debts within three years, according to Mr. Tumazos. Allegheny, Asarco, Birmingham Steel, Carpenter Technology, Chaparral Steel and Cyprus Minerals also could quickly pay off their debts.    While metals stocks have outperformed the market since the crash, they sell at only four to seven times their spare cash flow -- what's left after essential capital spending and other obligations. The multiple should be as high as 10 for some, like Carpenter, that can make money even in a recession, Mr. Tumazos says.    Recently, in an apparent move to deter possible takeover mores, Inco borrowed $1 billion to pay holders a special dividend. Alcan, Inland Steel and Phelps Dodge are retiring shares and have boosted their regular dividends.    Investors aren't convinced they'll see the return of regular high dividends on metals stocks -- high payouts that disappeared in the last recession. &quot;Management doesn't want to pay a dividend and have to cut it later&quot; when metals prices collapse, says a big mutual-fund manager.    Some companies have plans for their spare cash that mightn't include giving it away. Alcan is spending $1 billion on a new smelter and to expand a hydroelectric plant. &quot;There's really a pent-up demand for investment in our system,&quot; says David Morton, president. Birmingham Steel is upgrading its minimills and seeking acquisitions. &quot;We assume there's some deal out there we're going to make,&quot; says James Todd, president.    Bethlehem Steel since January 1987 has paid about $1 billion of debt to &quot;re-establish our liquidity and improve our capital structure,&quot; says Gary Millenbruch, chief financial officer. Also, in 1988, Bethlehem is funneling $600 million into an underfunded pension plan.    &quot;People are a little too quick to think huge amounts of cash flow are going to come bustling out of these companies to shareholders,&quot; says Scott Evans of College Retirement Equities Fund in New York.    Metals companies aren't obvious leveraged buy-out candidates. While RJR Nabisco has steady cash flows to service debt, some steel companies had losses of $3 million a day in 1982's slump. Even Mr. Tumazos doubts investment banks or commercial banks would finance metals company buy-outs.    But some such buy-outs look feasible, argues analyst John Brimelow of Keane Securities. If the economy holds up for another year, he says, some companies would have the resources to carry extra debt through recession to the next cyclical boom. A long boom in metals prices like the current one hasn't been seen since the 1960s, he says, so people &quot;aren't used to thinking about these things.&quot;    Mr. Brimelow owns stock in Proler International, a scrap-metal concern. &quot;It makes big money once in a blue moon,&quot; he says, &quot;but it's making it now.&quot; Proler, at 61 3/4 yesterday, has $23 a share in cash and could earn $15 a share or more in the next four quarters, he says; a buy-out would be &quot;practically self-financeable&quot; even if Proler's profit later disappears in recession.    Some companies clearly think profit will hold up long enough to repay extra debt. Nickel giant Inco expects to repay its $1 billion debt in a year or so. Florida Steel, after rebuffing a bid by Birmingham Steel, plans a management buy-out. KaiserTech, &quot;not the strongest aluminum company,&quot; was taken private, Mr. Tumazos notes. &quot;They're all making cyclical bets.&quot;    (See: &quot;Corrections andamp; Amplifications: Inco Ltd.&quot; -- WSJ Nov. 14, 1988)   ---                       Cash Flow Builds                                   Free                              Cash Flow        Years                                Per Day        Until                           (In millions        Debt-                            of dollars)         Free    Cyprus Minerals             0.5              .07    Inco                        2.3             1.2    Alcan                       2.6             1.5    Carpenter Tech.             0.2             2.7    Alcoa                       3.2             2.9    Birmingham Steel            0.2             1.8    Allegheny Ludlum            0.3             2.0   Source: Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette estimates</TEXT></DOC>
