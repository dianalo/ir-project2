One is the Israel of the Hasbara,the Hebrew word &quot;explanation,&quot; indicating the system designedto project Israel's image to the outside world, mostimportantly the U.S. The other is the Israel that actuallyexists. The former is a democratic polity seekingaccommodation with trustworthy Palestinians, tolerant in themanner of the public image of Teddy Kollek or Abba Eban. Thelatter is a state committed to a Greater Israel, set upon thepermanent suppression and/or eviction of Palestinians,offering one law for Jews and another for non-Jews, unwillingfrom the founding of the state to make anything other thantemporary accommodation with the outside world.   How long can the fiction of the first be maintained? Eventhe cosmetic powers of the Hasbara are being strained by thecomposition of the latest Israeli cabinet formed by YitzhakShamir. It is clear that this is a cabinet replete withpeople openly committed to holding the territories forever ina colonial status.</LP><TEXT>   The main priority of this new government is to bring inRussian Jews. Mass emigration from the Soviet Union has beengreeted exuberantly in Israel as the solution to what isofficially called &quot;the demographic problem,&quot; the euphemismfor the view that a Greater Israel would contain too manyPalestinians. The racist assumptions are very striking thoughnormally unquestioned in polite political society. Even the&quot;dovish&quot; Labor government once proposed a program to&quot;Judaize&quot; the Galilee. An analogy here would be a politicalplan to Christianize New York.   The U.S. posture is more hypocritical. For years the U.S.has called on the Soviet Union to permit Jewish emigration,when there was less fear of persecution. Now that RussianJews do have justifiable fear of persecution, the U.S.restricts the quota permitted entry here and, in effect,forces the refugees to go to Israel. Israel says the newarrivals are not going to the West Bank. But thousands aresettling in East Jerusalem, the Arab sector once held byJordan. Even the U.S. doesn't recognize Israel's annexationof East Jerusalem. The U.S. should let Russian Jews go wherethey wish -- mostly to the U.S.   Palestinians such as recent hungerstriker Faisal Husseinisay they are happy to see Jews escape persecution, but not tocome to the former Palestine from which Palestinians havebeen expelled and to which they are not permitted to return.   Hardly were the Palestinians murdered by Ami Popper on May20 cold in the morgue before Steven Emerson had rushed anarticle to this newspaper proclaiming that the &quot;values andconscience&quot; of Israeli leaders had been splendidly deployedin the wake of the killings. In my column May 31 I providedseveral examples of political realities in Israel and theoccupied territories, very much at odds with Mr. Emerson'smellow portraiture.   In his June 4 letter, Mr. Emerson asserted flatly that Imisrepresented reports in Ha'aretz and statements by majorIsraeli politicians. Did the celebration of the 13thanniversary of the Elkana settlement on the West Bank,attended by important Israelis, have anything to do withRabbi Moshe Levinger, head of the Gush Emunim (religiouszealots for settlement of the territories) and convicted ofkilling a Palestinian shopkeeper, for which he went to prisonafter the Elkana celebration? Mr. Emerson says there was nosuch account in the Hebrew daily Ha'aretz for May 18 and theElkana celebration had nothing to do with Rabbi Levinger.   A substantial part of Gideon Levi's report in Ha'aretzthat day concerned the cordial relations visible at Elkanabetween senior officials and Rabbi Levinger. &quot;Who didn'tembrace Levinger?&quot; the reporter asked rhetorically. &quot;Thegeneral commanding the central sector {of Israel and theterritories -- i.e., Gen. Yitzhak Mordecai} shook the hand ofthe criminal rabbi warmly, the head of the civilianadministration winked at him with great affection, thecommander of Judea and Samaria spoke to him in friendlyfashion. Yes, he's one of the boys, Levinger, among thesenior commanders of the Israeli army.&quot; Mr. Levi noted thepresence of President Chaim Herzog, wearing the symbolicheadwear of chauvinist ultra-right orthodoxy and referring toPalestinians around the settlement as &quot;foreigners.&quot;   Mr. Emerson implies in his letter, though does not stateflatly, that Rabbi Moshe Neriya was not quoted in Ha'aretzfor May 13 as enjoining every Jew &quot;to shoot Arabs left andright without thinking and without hesitating.&quot; But that isprecisely what the Ha'aretz for that day reported him assaying. Mr. Emerson slyly substitutes a more decorousstatement by the rabbi after the Popper killings, in theweekly Kol Ha'ir for May 25. The day after Popper openedfire, an article by Shulamit Hareven, a respected novelistand essayist, appeared in Yediot Ahronot, thelargest-circulation Hebrew-language newspaper. &quot;You, Mr.Levinger,&quot; Ms. Hareven wrote, &quot;have allowed the shedding ofthe blood of those . . . who stood in the road near Rishonwhen you said `I am sorry I did not have the privilege ofkilling an Arab' . . . You, Moshe Tzvi Neriya, have allowedthe shedding of the blood of the Arab day workers when yousaid . . . that `one should shoot right and left.' &quot;   Part of my argument was that Popper's killing spree hadrationality, given the rhetoric of Israeli extremists, fromMr. Shamir down. Ms. Hareven seems to be making the same sortof point. Mr. Emerson does not like it when the extremism ofsuch &quot;respectable&quot; figures as Binyamin Netanyahu, deputyforeign minister, is cited, with his support for massdeportation of Palestinians. But that is exactly what Mr.Netanyahu advocated, as quoted in the journal Hotam on Nov.24, 1989: &quot;Israel should have exploited the repression of thedemonstrations in China, when world attention focused on thatcountry, to carry out mass expulsions among the Arabs of theterritories. Regrettably, there was no support for thispolicy, which I put forward then and still recommend.&quot;   Mr. Emerson claims I believe the Israeli government isplotting &quot;to exterminate&quot; Palestinians. I believe nothing ofthe sort. I think Israeli policy is to maintain effectivecontrol over the territories, with some politicians sayingthe ultimate answer is transfer. This transfer-expulsion --is being seriously raised as a policy option.   I cited the courageous Israeli human-rights activistIsrael Shahak and Mr. Emerson responded by comparing him toLyndon LaRouche. This is a fair example of Mr. Emerson'stastes in polemic, suggesting equivalence between Prof.Shahak, a concentration-camp survivor, and Mr. LaRouche,whose movement has been stained with anti-Semitism. Manypeople in this country, including scores in congressionaloffices, admire Prof. Shahak's integrity and courage. Heappears frequently in the mainstream Israeli press, whichtreats him with respect. With his slur, Mr. Emerson dishonorsonly himself.   Mr. Emerson's prime role is to whitewash Israeligovernments and revile their critics. Joel Green of Torontoalso wrote an attack directly to me, at the same time as Mr.Emerson. He opened the rebuke, &quot;I was very happy to hear thenews of your mother's death.&quot; In truth, I prefer the dementedpassion of Mr. Green to the shabby truth-tampering of Mr.Emerson.   ---   Mr. Cockburn is a columnist for The Nation and theAnderson Valley (Calif.)
