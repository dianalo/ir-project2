He believes the U.S. has let him down on the touchy issue of acid rain, a shared U.S.-Canadian environmental problem. He also feels aggrieved over U.S. protectionist measures and over an apparent lack of high-level U.S. interest in current negotiations for a U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement.    Mr. Mulroney intends to take up these grievances when he meets here today with U.S. Vice President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker. The &quot;special visit&quot; by the U.S. officials was requested by Mr. Mulroney on short notice.    With Mr. Mulroney's Conservatives trailing badly in opinion polls, the prime minister needs to counter a widely held view that he is a pushover in negotiations with the U.S. A recent poll showed that while a majority of Canadians favor a free trade pact with the U.S., a majority also believe the U.S. bargains more firmly and effectively.    Reginald Stackhouse, a Conservative member of Parliament, said he can't understand why the U.S. government has shown so little regard for its closest ally. &quot;They aren't dealing with the enemy. This isn't North Vietnam,&quot; he said.    Mr. Mulroney is particularly disappointed by the purported U.S. failure to meet its commitments to combat acid rain, which is caused by gas emissions from power plants and other industrial sites. Such pollution at U.S. sites drifts across the border and causes heavy damage in Canada.    &quot;We've cleaned up our act,&quot; Mr. Mulroney said last weekend, asserting that the U.S. isn't doing enough.    At a Washington meeting last March, President Reagan and Mr. Mulroney endorsed a report by special envoys calling for the U.S. government and industry to share equally the costs of a $5 billion, five-year acid rain control program. But in the president's fiscal 1988 budget, submitted to Congress earlier this month, Canadian officials noted that a total of only $287 million had been earmarked for acid rain control.    External Affairs Minister Joe Clark recently sent a letter to Secretary of State George Shultz complaining about what he called the lack of U.S. effort to deal with the problem. Mr. Clark said Canadians are baffled by Washington's recent announcement of a pollution agreement with Mexico when there is &quot;such reluctance to deal with a more serious problem on your northern boundary.&quot;    The Mulroney government has been widely criticized for its recent agreement to resolve a dispute over Canada's softwood lumber shipments to the U.S. by imposing a 15% tax on its lumber exports. Even Trade Minister Pat Carney took strong exception to provisions inserted at U.S. insistence to prevent Canada from &quot;cheating&quot; on the tax. Mr. Stackhouse said he was &quot;shocked and offended&quot; by the U.S. stance.    The government also has been embarrassed by public statements by the U.S. trade negotiator, Peter Murphy, that the U.S.-Canadian auto pact be included in the current negotiations between the two countries for a free trade agreement.    The 22-year-old auto pact has various production guarantees for Canada and any suggestion that it be changed provokes a strong reaction in Ontario, which has prospered under the agreement.    Mr. Mulroney said he still believes the two countries can reach a trade pact. But the prime minister complained about the comparatively low priority Washington is according to the trade talks.    Thomas Niles, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, said the Bush-Baker visit demonstrates that &quot;the administration takes Canada seriously.&quot; He acknowledged that the two countries have problems, but added that he didn't agree with people who said &quot;there is a crisis&quot; in the relationship. </TEXT></DOC>
