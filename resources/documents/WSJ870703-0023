Kelly, raised $1.92 billion yesterday through offerings of debt and stock.    The stock offering, which raised $420 million, was smaller than originally planned. Reacting to a cool reception earlier this week by institutional investors, E-II cut the offering to 28 million shares from a planned 36 million and priced it at the bottom of its $15 to $18 range.    The company plans to use proceeds for aquisitions, but some investors have recently expressed doubt about Mr. Kelly's plans to use E-II as a base to build a larger company. &quot;Some people think there aren't as many undervalued acquisition candidates as a few years ago, and that there's too much money chasing the good ones,&quot; said William Rifkin, director of finance at Salomon Brothers Inc., lead underwriter for the stock offering.    Mr. Kelly, formerly chairman of Esmark Inc., which was acquired by Beatrice in 1984, has insisted to potential investors that he knows the secret to the acquisitions hunt. &quot;A lot of dogs chase Cadillacs. But few dogs drive Cadillacs,&quot; Mr. Kelly is said to have repeatedly told his Wall Street doubters. He couldn't be reached yesterday for comment.    The new company contains Beatrice's non-food businesses, such as Samsonite luggage and Stiffel lamps, and some its smaller specialty-food lines.    The erratic earnings of E-II's non-food businesses undoubtedly hurt the offering, analysts said. Although pre-tax profit for those businesses rose 3% to $121.1 million in the fiscal year ended Feb. 28 from $117.7 million a year earlier, it trailed the total of $128.1 million in fiscal 1985. &quot;How much should we pay for a company that's plodding along and whose earnings are down? Not much,&quot; said Norman Fosback, editor of New Issues, a newsletter based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.    E-II completed two debt offerings: $750 million of 12.85% senior subordinated notes due 1997, and $750 million of 13.05% subordinated debentures due 1999. The manager of the debt offerings was Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    The company plans to use part of the proceeds from the offerings to repay $800 million in debt to Beatrice.    The 65-year-old Mr. Kelly is E-II's chairman and chief executive officer; he remains chairman of Beatrice, which was taken private in a leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., a New York-based investment concern, in 1986.    Sources close to Mr. Kelly said yesterday they expected him to make at least two acquisitions this year. They said he has reviewed financial reports on about 200 prospects. Mr. Kelly has declined to elaborate, except to say that food companies are top candidates, and that he hopes to make an early acquisition of at least $5 billion. He has said the acquisitions would come through leveraged buyouts, which are financed largely by debt that is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or through asset sales. </TEXT></DOC>
