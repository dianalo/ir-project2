GNP, which measures the nation's output of goods and services, is expected to grow between 2% and 2.25% this year, a ministry official said. The economy expanded 1.7% in 1987.    Separately, the Berlin-based DIW Economic Research Institute said German GNP grew 1.5% in the first quarter, but only because of an unusually warm winter. &quot;If we try to adjust for the weather effect, we are left with zero growth,&quot; said Karin Mueller-Krummholz, a DIW economist.    Ms. Mueller-Krummholz said DIW is holding to its forecast that GNP will grow slightly less than 2% in 1988, despite recent statements by government officials forecasting a stronger expansion. DIW is one of the five research institutes whose joint report to the government earlier this month forecast 2% GNP growth in 1988, an upward revision from their January projection of growth between 1.5% and 2%.    The government has been the target of both foreign and domestic critics who have urged it to foster stronger economic growth. But officials have firmly resisted new stimulative fiscal or monetary measures.    Helmut Schlesinger, vice president of Germany's central bank, has forecast 1988 growth of 2% to 2.5%. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has forecast 2.25% German economic growth this year. </TEXT></DOC>
