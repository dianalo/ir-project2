Testifying Wednesday to a House Armed Services subcommittee,Watkins strongly hinted that one casualty of the productionbreakdown could be the Trident II ballistic missile, considered byexperts to be the most accurate U.S. missile.   One key breakdown is at the Rocky Flats plant in Colorado, whichmakes plutonium triggers for nuclear arms. It has been closed sincelast November to correct safety and management problems. Watkinssaid he hoped it would be back in operation by this summer, but nofirm date for restart has been set.   The Energy Department owns all facilities that develop andproduce U.S. nuclear arms.   Reps. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., and Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.,asked Watkins whether the indefinite shutdown at Rocky Flats couldforce delays in outfitting newly deployed Trident submarines withthe new missiles.   Watkins replied that he could not discuss details in public. Buthe added that as a general comment, ``I can guarantee if we don'tmove aggressively'' to get the weapons production complex back infull operation soon, ``there will be severe ramifications.''   He then added, in reference to the Trident missile program:``That won't be the last'' to be hampered by the interruption atRocky Flats and other weapons facilities.   Watkins also said his department had notified the DefenseDepartment, ``Yes, there would probably be a negative impact on theweapons stockpile this year and next.''   Lt. Bruce Williams, a Navy spokesman, said Watkins' comments``came as quite a surprise here.'' He said the Navy had not beennotified of any impending shortage of warheads for the Trident orother Navy nuclear weapons systems. Williams said he could notcomment on specific deployment plans for security reasons.   Also out of service, due to safety problems, are three reactorsat the Savannah River plant in South Carolina that make tritium, aradioactive gas needed to boost the explosive power of nuclearwarheads.   Watkins told lawmakers he hoped to get one reactor restarted bythe end of this year but stressed that questions of reactor safetyand other matters remained to be resolved.   The Los Angeles Times reported earlier this month that thewarhead stockpile is now so small that the Navy has only enougharmed Trident II missiles, known formally as the D-5, to equip twoTrident subs with a full complement of 24 missiles.   The first of those two subs, the USS Tennessee, is expected togo on its first operational patrol from its base at King's Bay,Ga., by this weekend, said William Arkin, a nuclear arms specialistfor the environmental group Greenpeace.   The Navy has declined to comment on the timing of theTennessee's deployment.   A second Trident sub, the USS Pennsylvania, is scheduled to goto sea with Trident II missiles in December, Arkin said.   The Times report, citing unidentified government officials, saidsubsequent deployments of Trident subs are being jeopardized by theRocky Flats shutdown.   That would mean the USS West Virginia, which is to enter servicenext spring, might have to be armed with existing Trident Imissiles instead of the new version.   The first eight Trident subs were deployed with the Trident Imissile, which is less accurate than the new version. The vesselsare scheduled to be re-equipped with Trident II missiles during the1990s as they brought in for overhauls.   The Navy plans to build 24 Trident subs and buy nearly 900Trident II missiles, according to Arkin, whose organization favorskilling the missile program.   In an interview, Arkin said the Rocky Flats shutdown isinterfering with other nuclear weapons programs, including theTomahawk sea-lauched cruise missile, the stealth air-launchedcruise missile and the B-61 and B-83 gravity bombs.</TEXT></DOC>
