Treves, president and owner of Elite Publishing Corp., New York, said it holds about a 5.3% stake in Weldotron Corp.'s common shares outstanding.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said it holds 96,400 Weldotron shares, including 45,900 bought July 1 to Oct. 4 for $6.25 to $7.63 each.    The group said in the filing that it bought its Weldotron stock &quot;to acquire a significant equity interest&quot; in the packaging-machinery maker.    It said it wants to exert its influence over Weldotron's management by protecting the company's patent rights in the U.S. and abroad. It also wants to assist the company in expanding its market share, the filing said.    In addition, the group said it currently plans to buy more Weldotron shares, but didn't rule out selling some or all of its holdings.    A spokesman for Weldotron, Piscataway, N.J., said the company has not seen the filing and couldn't comment.    Weldotron shares closed at $7.50, up 37.5 cents, in American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
