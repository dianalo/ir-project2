 Thisinstant media success is attracting skepticism, especially because manypublications have been bashing expert systems.andP;  Considering the failure ofexpert systems to achieve the impossible successes so confidently forecastfor them, perhaps a heathy distrust for new technologies is warranted.andM;The following quiz has been especially prepared for the born-againneural-network researcher struggling to convince a skeptical manager that aneural-network project is worth funding.andP;  The quiz is designed to help youprepare for the proposal writing and the subsequent funding interview.andM;Read the eight neural-network parables; each one contains a lesson in sellingneural networks to management.andP;  Then select the answer you think bestillustrates the lesson contained in the parable.andM;Answer carefully--the quiz uses both positive and negative reinforcementlearning.andP;  As a result, some answers score points, some subtract points, andsome have no effect on your score.andM;PARABLE 1andM;We have all heard about SAIC's success in using neural networks for its TNAproject.andP;  TNA is a $750,000 box that can detect plastic explosives in sealedluggage.andP;  The TNA system bombards sealed luggage with neutron radiation,which is then detected and classified by a back-error propagating neuralnetwork.andP;  The machine handles about 10 bags a minute, meaning the Los AngelesInternational Airport will require about 12 machines ($8 million worth) fortotal screening of international baggage.andM;The U.S.andP;  Congress has proposed a requirement that domestic airlines installthese machines in all threatened airports at the airlines' expense.andP;  Theairlines responded reasonably enough: they noted that terrorist threats weredirected against U.S.andP;  policies and not the airlines.andP;  The airlines concludedthat since it was U.S.andP;  policy and not airline policy causing this problem,the U.S.andP;  government should pay for the TNAs.andM;But on to the parable.andP;  About three years ago SAIC received a contract fromthe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to develop a machine like TNA.andP;  Atthat time, SAIC agreed to meet certain specifications for the machine.andO;Initially, SAIC used a linear-discriminant method to classify threats basedon the neutron profile from the sealed baggage.andP;  However, there was aproblem.andP;  When using this method, the bags had to be grouped by size beforegoing into the machine.andP;  The machine would be set up and all the small bagswould go through, then the machine would be set up in a different mode andall the slightly larger bags would go through, and so on until all the bagswere passed.andP;  Hardly a fast throughput methodology.andM;During this time SAIC had consumed the funds from the FAA contract, the duedate for demonstration was near and the machine was not meeting the originalFAA specifications.andP;  With demonstration deadlines rapidly approaching, SAICtried neural networks.andM;SAIC manufactures a line of neural-network software and hardware that comesfrom the San Diego, Calif.andP;  division.andP;  TNA is manufactured by the Santa Claradivision.andP;  Free software and hardware between divisions?andP;  Not a chance.andP;  SoSanta Clara bought an AnsSim, TNA met its target specifications, and everyonelived happily ever after.andP;  Everyone except the airlines, who are stillfiguring out how to pay for all the machines.andM;Helpful hint: recently a survey of neural-network applications was conducted.andO;One of the questions asked why neural networks were chosen for the project,and more than half the respondents answered (choose one):andM;a) Don't go into the airline business.andM;b) When all else fails, try neural networks.andM;c) Congress loves to spend other peoples' money.andM;d) Give into terrorist demands; they'll stop bombing airplanes and we won'tneed the TNA.andM;PARABLE 2andM;One of the great books of marketing is Marketing Warfare by Al Ries and JackTrout (McGraw-Hill, 1986).andP;  In the section on principles of defensivemarketing warfare they note that &quot;the best defensive strategy is the courageto attack yourself.&quot;andM;While having dinner with a marketing executive from a large digitalsemiconductor firm, I inquired: &quot;How did you sell your management on making aneural-network chip with analog weight storage?&quot;andP;  Imagine the my surprisewhen my dinner guest answered: &quot;It was easy!andP;  I told them we make digitalchips and microprocessors.andP;  Suppose that all these neural-network crazies areright and the next big generation of chips are analog neural-network chips.andO;It's completely orthogonal to our current business.andP;  An analog neural-networkchip will be an attack on ourselves.andP;  Of course it's the right thing to do!andO;After a logical argument like that top management was eating out of my handand the chip was done,&quot; said the marketeer.andM;The lesson is:andM;a) It's fun to have dinner with a marketing person.andM;b) Stay in the business you're in and don't try anything new.andM;c) Read Marketing Warfare.andM;d) Occasionally firms should do something completely orthogonal to theircurrent business.andM;PARABLE 3andM;It has long been known at the U.S.andP;  Dept.andP;  of Defense that the sure way toget something funded is to show that the Russians are doing it.andP;  Conversely,Russian scientists have discovered that funding in the USSR is easilyattained by demonstrating that the U.S.andP;  is doing it.andP;  Now with glasnostbreaking out all over, the generals will have to find some other horse toride through the Capitol Hill Steeplechase.andM;One can find analogous behavior among many venture capitalists (VCs).andP;  Whenseeking funding, their prime reason for rejecting a new idea is &quot;since no oneelse is doing it, we can't determine the success of the idea or the marketsize.&quot;andP;  Unfortunately, after a few companies have gone into the market, VCschange their position to &quot;the market is too crowded for a new firm.&quot;andM;The lesson is:andM;a) The competition is using neural networks and so should we if we are tostay competitive.andM;b) Research funding agencies and venture capitalists behave like sheep andlemmings.andM;c) The U.S.andP;  Dept.andP;  of Defense loves neural networks.andM;d) Glasnost drives neural-network funding.andM;PARABLE 4andM;Sometimes we are lucky to find ourselves working in an industry not filledwith early adopters.andP;  An industry in which the computers are large and blue.andO;An industry that has large databases; databases that contain the histories ofdecisions like &quot;for this loan application we had this profitability,&quot;histories like &quot;in accepting this underwriting application we had to pay outso much in claims,&quot; and so on.andM;Neural networks can extract decisionmaking capability from these largedatabases.andP;  Today neural networks can even articulate the rules andrelationships found in these relationships.andP;  In fact, you could pole theoutputs of the neural network with the existing statistical solution andexpert system to improve accuracy.andM;Some people can recognize a technology vacuum and are willing to adopt a newtechnology in its early stages to get a jump on the competition.andP;  Since wecan view neural networks as a biologically motivated, statistical-mappingtechnology, many industries can apply neural network techniques to make aprofit and create barriers to competitive entry.andM;The lesson is:andM;a) Blue machines can't run neural networks.andM;b) The completion isn't using neural networks so we should.andM;c) When lost, use a mapping technology.andM;d) Get into a business without early adopters.andM;PARABLE 5andM;Scientist and writer Arthur C. Clark observed that if an esteemed seniorscientist says a thing can be done they are almost always right.andO;Alternately, if an esteemed senior scientist says something cannot be donethen they are almost always wrong.andM;The history of science is strewn with the bodies of naysayers.andP;  As PhilipWasserman points out in his excellent book Neural Computing Theory andPractice (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1989): &quot;Today's dogma becomes tomorrow'srubbish.&quot;andP;  For instance, you can't sail around the world, there will never beroom temeprature superconductors, computers will never get a masters ratingin chess, and the classic &quot;every job is AI-able except mine.&quot;andP;  (For anexample of Parable 5, see Player Piano by Kurt Vonnegut.)andM;The lesson is:andM;a) Read Player Piano.andM;b) Read Neural Computing Theory and Practice.andM;c) Since experts say neural networks are &quot;sterile&quot; and &quot;without scientificvalue,&quot; we can assume using Clark's Law that they really do have &quot;scientificvalue.&quot;andM;d) Don't use neural networks because experts say they're &quot;sterile&quot; and&quot;without scientific value.&quot;andM;PARABLE 6andM;You may not realize it, but only so many articles can fit into the tradepress about a hot new technology.andP;  Luckily, neural networks were pushed offthe front pages by cold fusion, the most recent in a long list of charlatantechnologies.andP;  However, in concert with Clark's Law, we can confidently statethat cold fusion will work some time in the future.andM;Many technologies have suffered through the equivalent of a nuclear winter asa result of overhype.andP;  The exaggerated claims of the press lead to heightenedexpectations that can't be met.andP;  Occasionally, the hype in one technology ispushed off the front pages by hype in another technology.andP;  This allows thefirst technology to mature without metahype.andP;  The neural-network industryshould thank Pons and Fleischmann for diverting the glare of publicity fromneural networks, thereby avoiding exaggerated expectations.andM;The cold fusion fiasco also helped improve the reporter's jaundiced eye whenviewing new technology.andP;  Cold fusion gave neural networks at least anotheryear to get real applications into the field.andP;  Any technology that courts thefourth estate must always remember what the press giveth the press willtaketh away, otherwise there won't be any crises available to sellnewspapers.andM;a) Neural networks have been saved by cold fusion.andM;b) Overhype is good for new technologies.andM;c) DARPA is working on an optical, superneuro-computer that uses roomtemperature superconductors and is powered by coldandM;d) The press always makes realistic predictions for new technology.andM;PARABLE 7andM;We all know about the mythical person-month and how the mythical person-monthis really more like a year when it comes to computer programming.andP;  We haveall met the programmer who believes that uncommented code is the path to jobsecurity.andP;  Suppose you have a computer that could learn from observablebehavior.andP;  Even if it could only learn at a first-grade level it might bebetter than a disgruntled programmer.andP;  And we know that the neural networkcertainly won't leave a path of Trojan horses when we turn off the computer.andO;Will it?andM;But don't be foiled: it won't work without people.andP;  In the 1960s we hadprogrammers, in the 1970s we shot the programmers and the systems engineeremerged, in the 1980s we traded in the systems engineer for the knowledgeengineer, and now that we have certified knowledge engineers we have theemergence of the neural-network architect.andM;The lesson is:andM;a) There is no free lunch--you will always need a technologist to help peopleutilize new technology.andM;b) Neural networks are a management conspiracy to displace computerprogrammers.andM;c) 12 programmers working together will finish a one-person-year programmingtask in one month.andM;d) Uncommented code is the path to job security.andM;PARABLE 8andM;Rationally explaining your reasoning process to another person is difficultand we do it only when hand waving doesn't work.andP;  Why do you suppose that is?andO;Because rational thought is only a recently evolved process in the humanmind.andP;  In fact, since rational thought implies reasoning, communication ofrational thought may not be possible without language.andP;  How do we knowsomeone is acting rationally unless they can explain their reasoning to us?andM;Most of what we do as human beings is essentially pattern matching andassociation.andP;  Symbolic reasoning has only recently evolved and is bettersuited for explanation than for scientific breakthroughts or even analysis.andO;It is true that correlation may not imply causality; however, correlation isusually a good place to start, particularly in the absence of facts to thecontrary.andP;  Machines have a hard time using pattern matching, the first methodof survival, because programming all those patterns is difficult.andP;  However,neural networks will make computers that learn to match patterns and makeassociations feasible.andM;An ant matches patterns throughout its life; it is born with all the patternsit will ever need.andP;  You can't teach an ant anything.andP;  Yet it is one of themost successful creatures on the face of the earth.andM;What is the lesson here?andM;a) Symbolic logic is always the best way to solve a problem.andM;b) We should teach computers how to hand wave.andM;c) Correlation and pattern matching are strong learning methods indata-intensive problems.andM;d) Ant brains on chips are the technology of the future.andM;Scoring follows.andP;  Total your score and decide for yourself if you are readyto meet with your boss or if yo need more education.andM;NUMBER 1andM;a) Don't go into the airline business.andM;Not a bad idea with all the buyouts going on, but wrong.andP;
