The leveraged buyout transaction typically has hinged oncooperation with a management that ultimately will stay on to run acompany long after the deal wizards have finished their work. Butin the push to do deals, some LBO partnerships might abandon atouch of their previous gentility.   Hamilton James, a managing director at DLJ Securities Corp.,noted Wednesday that the level of aggressiveness in the buyoutindustry has been on the rise recently.   ``People are out beating the bushes and not waiting for thephone to ring,'' he said. ``They are more aggressive in terms ofthe prices they are willing to pay and the amount of risk they arewilling to take.''   The line between friendly and unfriendly encounters has fusedfrom distinct black-and-white into a murky grey.   ``Something that might start out looking unfriendly may end upbeing a white knight,'' noted one LBO partner who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   With more money available for deals, he predicted there will be``more circumstances where the firms capable of doing the largerLBOs are stepping up to the plate and doing things in a more publicfashion.''   Since its founding in 1976, the privately held KKR hasspearheaded the growing popularity of leveraged buyouts, in which apurchase is made with mostly borrowed money that is repaid withfunds from the target company's operations or the sale of itsassets.   KKR has amassed an estimated $5.6 billion that can be used asequity to leverage roughly seven times that amount. Thepartnership, which controls corporate giants ranging from BeatriceCos. to Stop andamp; Shop, most often has entered into friendlytransactions.   Despite the unsolicited nature of KKR's bid for Kroger, analystsare reluctant to characterise the overture as hostile.   The hard-driving New York partnership wasn't ``the first one totee the company up, to put it into play,'' said DLJ's James.   Maryland's Haft family did that with a bid of $4.36 billion aday before KKR appeared on the scene, and Kroger directors alsostirred the pot by stating that they were considering arestructuring.   ``The company already was on the auction block _ KKR didn't putit there,'' James said. In addition, KKR has yet to try to force atender offer without board approval.   ``You will not see firms that want to be major players in theLBO industry doing anything unfriendly because that would be badfor the management in the next deal,'' said Alberto Cribiore, apartner in the LBO and investment firm Clayton andamp; Dubilier Inc.   ``KKR is becoming much more of a financial company than an LBOcompany _ it's a different kind of animal,'' he said.   The Kroger bid is similar to KKR's pursuit of the Chicago-basedBeatrice foods conglomerate. KKR came on the scene uninvited andcontinued to pressure the board until Beatrice directors finallyaccepted in what the industry dubbed a ``bear hug.''   Fortune magazine reported in July that both Henry Kravis andGeorge Roberts privately argued in favor of launching a hostiletender offer for Beatrice while awaiting word from the company'sboard on what it would do. Opposing such a move was Jerome KohlbergJr., who has left the firm amid talk that he was dismayed not onlyby the size of the deals the partnership was spinning but also bythe growing agerssiveness of his younger partners.   Analysts note that Kroger could be forced to capitulate in thesame way that Beatrice did.   ``Kroger's options are limited ... and a higher offer by them isunlikely,'' said Linda Morris, a analyst at Provident National Bankin Philadelphia.   She thinks Kroger could be pushed into the arms of anotherleveraged buyout firm, namely Odyssey Partners or Gibbons, Green,van Amerongen Ltd., both of which have interests in supermarkets.   So far there haven't been two leveraged buyout firms in abidding war against each other. ``But we haven't seen a lot ofthings yet,'' Morris said.   The LBO firms are ``just another player out there that has thecapacity to (bid for companies) _ it just adds to the list that'salready there,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
