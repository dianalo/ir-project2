Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir failed in an effort to hold aCabinet vote that he had hoped would bolster the credibility of hispeace initiative.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Palestinian assailants beat andstabbed to death an Arab man, apparently for collaborating withIsraeli authorities, Arab reports said.   His death raised to 565 the number of Palestinians killed in theuprising against Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the WestBank. Most died of army gunfire, but at least 70 were killed byPalestinians who suspected them of cooperating with Israel. Inaddition, 36 Israelis have been killed.   In the occupied territories, four Arabs were wounded by armygunfire Sunday, Arab hospital officials said.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said elementary schools and12th-grade classes in the Gaza Strip and West Bank will be allowedto reopen Saturday.   Twelfth-grade was included to help high school students graduate.Grades seven to 11 are to reopen in coming weeks. Colleges remainclosed.   Israel radio said, however, that security officials were worriedthat activists of the fundamentalist group Hamas may force childrento boycott classes.   Israeli officials said they closed schools because they considerthem hotbeds of nationalist violence.   Israel radio said authorities were under strong pressure from theUnited States and European countries to reopen them. The U.N. Reliefand Works Association said West Bank schools have been open only 40days in the current academic year.   ``We hope these schools ... stay open so that Palestinianchildren do not suffer any further harm from the suspension of thelearning process,'' the agency's commissioner-general, GiorgioGiacomelli, said in a statement issued earlier this week from hisheadquarters in Vienna.   Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, head of the West Bank's militaryadministration, told Palestinian students not to demonstrate whenthe schools open. ``Remove studies from the cycle of violence andtake every opportunity to learn,'' he said.   ``We will not agree in any way to violence, we will not agree inany way to anything but studies,'' Erez said, speaking on Israeltelevision's Arabic language news service. ``This is a one-timeopportunity.''   He met Sunday with principals of West Bank schools and urged themto warn students not to hold political demonstrations in or nearschools.   Erez said almost half the West Bank's 220,000 students will beginstudies Saturday.   ``It's our right to have an education,'' said Mustafa Natche,former mayor of the West Bank town of Hebron. ``It was a violationof our human rights to close the schools, so we are happy they areto reopen.''   At Israel's weekly Cabinet meeting, Shimon Peres, leader of theleft-of-center Labor Party and vice prime minister, blocked effortsto end a crisis that began earlier this month when Shamir'sright-wing Likud block set conditions for a government peace plan.   Shamir tried to call a Cabinet vote to stipulate that the party'sconditions did not change the initial peace plan. But Peres andother Labor Party members blocked the vote, and the meeting endedwith no decision.   Peres wants a clear statement from the government that the Likudconditions are not part of the plan. But he said a compromise maystill be reached that would cancel his party's threat to pull out ofthe coalition and topple the government.   Shamir's plan calls for Palestinians in the West Bank and GazaStrip to elect representatives to negotiate peace with Israel.Likud's hard-line conditions say, however, that the uprising mustend before any elections are held, and Israeli-annexed Arab eastJerusalem will be excluded from voting.   In comments Sunday on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,''Secretary of State James A. Baker said the Bush administrationbelieves the Shamir plan stands as originally announced, despiteShamir's separate agreement with his party's hard-liners.   ``We are now convinced by having talked to ... representatives ofthe Israeli government that they are fully supportive of theiroriginal elections proposal and initiative as they originallyannounced it, and we are going to continue ... to work very hard tomake it happen,'' Baker said.   In Jerusalem, the director-general of the Prime Ministry, YossiBen Aharon, said the United States must decide between its supportfor the peace initiative and the dialogue it began with the PLO lastDecember.   ``The two are mutually incompatible,'' Ben Aharon told TheAssociated Press.   In another development, the Haaretz newspaper said the army plansto build new prison camps and enlarge existing ones to housePalestinians detained, arrested or convicted of nationalist crimes,such as belonging to the Palestine Liberation Organization orattacking Israelis.   Haaretz said the army plans to have camps to house up to 20,000prisoners by 1990.   A military spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, wouldnot confirm the report, but said the army now houses 8,633Palestinian prisoners.</TEXT></DOC>
