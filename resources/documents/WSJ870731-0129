Sweden already is investigating whether the sale of 40 of the boats to Iran's customs service by the Swedish company Boghammar Marin AB in 1983 and 1984 violated the country's export laws.    The company's president, Anders Boghammar, said in a telephone interview that &quot;there isn't any question that the boats were built and delivered in accordance with Swedish regulations and for civil purposes.&quot; He also said the company hasn't received further orders from Iran.    At a meeting this week with senior officials in Sweden's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the deputy chief of the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm, Roland Kuchel, expressed concern that the boats might be used in attacks on 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers now bearing the U.S. flag and operating under U.S. naval protection. He asked that Sweden act to prevent further sales of the boats to Iran, according to Bo Heinebaeck, the Foreign Ministry's chief spokesman. A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy confirmed the meeting but wouldn't elaborate on the topics discussed.    Mr. Heinebaeck said Sweden couldn't promise that it would stop exports of the boats, which originally were designed and sold for commercial purposes. But he said Sweden's War Materials Inspection Board has begun an investigation to determine if the aluminum boats, which normally would be too fragile to sustain weaponry, were reinforced for military use before they were shipped to Iran.    If the boats were modified before leaving Sweden, their export would have violated a Swedish law barring the sale of military equipment to countries engaged in or likely to become involved in conflict. In addition, if the Swedish government finds that the vessels, without modification, should have been classified as defense equipment, the boat sale to Iran as well as other sales by Boghammar to the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan could have been illegal. </TEXT></DOC>
