WinterStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SRD BPTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)PETROLEUM (PET) </IN><TEXT>   British Petroleum Co. raised its offer for the rest of Standard Oil Co. to about $7.9 billion, a move that appears to overcome the takeover's potential legal hurdles.    The sweetened bid for the 45% of Cleveland-based Standard Oil that the British oil giant doesn't already own is about $450 million more than BP's initial offer last month.    The new bid won the acceptance of seven outside Standard Oil directors who had sought better terms. BP said Standard Oil shareholders opposed to the bid agreed to drop their class-action lawsuits in exchange for the higher offer.    BP said it would pay $71.50 cash for each of the 107.3 million Standard Oil shares that it doesn't own, adding $1.50 a share to its March 26 offer. BP also offered a warrant to buy four of its own shares, in the form of one BP American Depositary Receipt or ADR, for every five Standard Oil shares outstanding. ADRs are commonly traded certificates representing shares held abroad.    In addition, BP extended the bid to May 11 from May 5. The extension permits Standard Oil holders to receive a regular 70-cent-a-share dividend that otherwise would have gone to BP if its bid had succeeded under the earlier expiration period.    Analysts' estimates varied on the value of the warrant, exercisable at $80 per BP ADR. But the estimates were around $2 a share, meaning Standard Oil shareholders would receive a total of about $4.20 a share more than under the first offer.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Standard Oil shares closed at $73.375, up $1.25. With volume of almost 7.1 million shares, it led the most-actives list. Also on the Big Board, BP's American depositary receipts closed at $61.00, up $1.625.    BP now should have little trouble in its bid, analysts predicted. British brokers said the company was eager to ensure the success of its offer because failure or drawn-out lawsuits could hurt the British government's plan to sell its 32% stake in BP this fall.    &quot;We wanted to complete the acquisition,&quot; said Roddy Kennedy, a BP spokesman in London. &quot;The settlement also removes the possibility of protracted litigation, which in other transactions have delayed things by up to a year.&quot;    Mr. Kennedy wouldn't specify those transactions. But BP has been especially keen to avoid the legal delays faced by Royal Dutch/Shell Group in a similar bid for a minority interest in Shell Oil Co. in 1984 and 1985.    &quot;We think the new terms will almost certainly ensure a success,&quot; said Paul Gregory, an analyst at Wood, Mackenzie andamp; Co. in Edinborough, Scotland. Mr. Gregory and other analysts said the inclusion of warrants gave Standard Oil holders a chance to benefit from appreciation in BP stock if oil prices rise.    Shareholders' ability to participate longer-term may be important in defusing objections to the BP offer. In buying the remainder of Standard Oil amid relatively low oil prices, BP would get the full benefit of Standard Oil's large Alaskan reserves when oil prices rose, some Standard Oil shareholders worried.    The enriched BP offer resulted from negotiations between BP and a special committee of Standard Oil directors, said sources familiar with the talks. According to these sources, the discussions were chiefly between BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters and Douglas A. Danforth, chief executive officer of Westinghouse Electric Corp. and chairman of Standard Oil's special directors' committee. Standard Oil's board set up the panel more than a year ago to monitor relations between Standard Oil and BP.    A joint BP-Standard Oil statement yesterday reiterated that the committee and Standard Oil's full board urged shareholders to decide for themselves on the offer. But the statement said the outside-director committee unanimously found the new terms &quot;acceptable.&quot; All of Standard Oil's directors will sell their shares to BP, the statement said.    &quot;The committee felt that they had negotiated as good a deal as they could get, and the board concurred in that,&quot; said one person familiar with the negotiations. The committee still had misgivings about whether the bid was &quot;adequate,&quot; this source said. But &quot;there's sometimes a difference between acceptable and adequate.&quot;    First Boston Corp. wrote a report for the Standard Oil special committee stating that BP's original $70-a-share offer was inadequate. First Boston placed an $85-a-share valuation on Standard Oil, partly based on the possibility of rising oil prices.    BP rejected that analysis but decided to offer more &quot;because there was a priority on getting this out of the way before the government's share sale,&quot; said Michael Unsworth, an analyst at Smith New Court Agency in London. Drawn-out lawsuits would have created uncertainty and made the government's sale of its BP stake difficult to price, Mr. Unsworth said.    (Revised WSJ April 30, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
