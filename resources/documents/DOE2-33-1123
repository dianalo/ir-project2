The question arises as to the origin and the interconversionamong the carbon species. The chemical pathways for the conversion ofCH{sub 4} to CO and CO{sub 2} are for the most part known. The reverseprocess, the reduction of CO to CH{sub 4} is however, poorly understood.A new reaction is proposed, H{sub 2}CO + H + M yields CH3O + M, whichmight play a fundamental role in the reduction of CO or CH{sub 4}. Anupdate is presented of nitrile photochemistry on Titan.</TEXT></DOC>
