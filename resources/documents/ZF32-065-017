(Micro Report)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Buckler, Grant.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Local-area networks are becoming increasingly complex, andmonitoring and managing them requires a number of hardware andsoftware products.andP;  Among the network software tools available arethose that track users and those that track usage.andP;  Networkanalyzers, hardware devices that can track the progress of datapackets through a network and resolve complex difficultiesresulting from mixed technologies, may also be utilized.andO;BindView, a network software package from the LAN Support Group,is used by The Toronto Globe and Mail newspaper to keep track offiles and monitor access privileges.andP;  LanSight Support helpsGreat-West Life Assurance Co, Winnipeg, to keep track of the loadon the network.andP;  The City of Ottawa relies on the networkmanagement capabilities of the VINES operating system from BanyanSystems Inc. Most users stress that tools must be fully understoodbefore they can be well used.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   BindViewandplus; (Network management software) (Usage)VINES (Network operating system) (Usage)LANSight Support (Network management software) (Usage).andO;Topic:     Computer industryLocal area networksNetwork management softwareNetwork ManagementNetwork MonitorsNetwork operating systemsUser Needs.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Local-area networks are complicated and getting more so every day.andP;  As LANsget bigger and add more functions, the job of keeping them running smoothlygets more involved.andM;A variety of tools exist to help with this job.andP;  They can be divided intothree main categories.andM;First are products that help keep track of users and their privileges.andP;  Thesesoftware packages help monitor information such as who has access to whatdata.andM;A second group tracks network usage.andP;  These packages record the amount anddistribution of network traffic, helping to pinpoint bottlenecks and givesome advance warning when upgrades are needed.andM;Then there are the hardware devices that get right into the nuts and bolts ofthe system.andP;  Network analysers track individual packets of data as they movethrough the network.andM;These often expensive hardware devices are mainly useful in complex networks,where mixed technologies can sometimes result in esoteric problems.andM;Some products combine the functions of the analyser and the monitor.andM;There are also specialized instruments for checking cables and connections.andM;In the first class of products, Kevin Speicher, information centre consultantat The Globe and Mail in Toronto, likes BindView, from the LAN Support Groupin Houston.andP;  The software helps Speicher keep track of which files on thenetwork belong to which user and two has access to what.andM;Knowing how heavily a network is loaded is a reassuring way of keeping aheadof user problems.andP;  Great-West Life Assurance Co. of Winnipeg uses a productcalled Lansight, from the Network Enhancement Utilities Division of IntelCorp., in some of its offices.andM;Delbert Yap, senior management information specialist, says it givesinformation on response time and warns of problems with individual machineson the network.andM;The City of Ottawa also tracks the load on its networks.andP;  Mark Bialic,microcomputer co-ordinator, says the city relies on utilities built intoVines, the LAN operating system from Banyan Systems Inc. of Westboro, Mass.andM;&quot;It helps us determine problems before they occur,&quot; he says.andM;Users and vendors alike point to a growing need for management tools that canwork with networking products from many vendors.andP;  The idea is to gather dataon network traffic in one place, even when the network uses many vendors'hardware and software.andM;A key to making this possible is the Simple Network Management Protocol(SNMP), a standard which is becoming increasisngly popular.andM;&quot;There must be a heavy investment in learning to use the tools that are outthere,&quot; says Paul Saxton, a systems analyst at the Canadian operations ofPrudential Insurance Co. of America in Scarborough, Ont.andP;  &quot;They gatherinformation for you, but don't readily report back on what the problem is andhow to go about fixing it.&quot;andM;Grant Buckler is a freelance writer based in Kingston, Ont.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
