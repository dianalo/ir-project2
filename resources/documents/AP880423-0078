DALY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael S. Dukakis, the likely Democratic nominee,says he considers Republican George Bush ``extremely vulnerable''in a host of international matters and while a relative novice inforeign affairs, ``I also have some rather strongly held views.''   With a rare edge in his voice, Dukakis ran quickly through hisbrief against Bush, mentioning arms-for-hostages, support forformer Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, a ``failed and illegalpolicy in Central America,'' and ``seven precious years doingvirtually nothing'' about the Middle East.   ``What good is experience if that's what it produces?'' Dukakisasked, trying out a line for the general election that would bindBush to the policies of President Reagan.   In an interview with The Associated Press, Dukakis spoke atlength about his foreign policy views and declared himself eager togo after Bush on foreign and military affairs.   ``I think the vice president is extremely vulnerable on foreignpolicy. It's going to be an issue. Believe me, I'm going to takethat issue to him and the Republican Party,'' Dukakis said, talkingthrough a hasty lunch last Thursday in his Statehouse office.   Dukakis was asked point-blank whether he could imagine himselfunleashing a nuclear warhead.   ``I don't think it will be necessary,'' he said. ``But if thepolicy of nuclear deterrence means what it says, then that has tobe a possibility. Otherwise, nuclear deterrence doesn't meananything.''   In his view, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev recognizes theSoviet Union is facing grave internal problems, especially in itssagging economy.   In the past three years alone, Dukakis said, the Soviet Unionhas been buffeted by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and a pendingwithdrawal from Afghanistan while at the same time expressing awillingness to reduce nuclear arms and conventional forces.   ``All of this is very new, very different. I think principallybecause Gorbachev recognizes that they're falling farther andfarther behind in an economic sense. The Soviet economic system isfailing, and they're got to open up that system, or they're goingto become a second- or third-rate economic power,'' Dukakis said.   While some Americans might welcome a weakened Soviet state,Dukakis does not.   ``I think an insecure, failing Soviet Union is not in ournational interest. I'm not saying that a militarily powerful,adventurous Soviet Union is in our interest. But continuedpolitical instability in the Soviet Union, failure to grapple withserious problems _ I don't think that's in the best interest ofworld peace and world stability,'' he said.   In a still-hypothetical general election, Bush might be expectedto try to tag Dukakis as a traditional Democratic dove in the castof George McGovern. But while Dukakis on Nicaragua may sound likeMcGovern on Vietnam, Dukakis talks tough about drawing a linearound North and South America.   ``Look. We're not going to tolerate a Soviet satellite in thishemisphere. And it's important to define those terms. ... I'mtalking about a country that is a base for Soviet military powerand is engaging in systematic subversion of its neighbors. We'renot going to tolerate that.''   In foreign policy terms, Dukakis, as a third-term governor ofMassachusetts, has a political problem and a political opportunity.He lacks depth of personal experience, especially compared to Bush_ a former ambassador, CIA director and now vice president.   The same inexperience was true of Reagan and former PresidentCarter, both of whom came to the presidency by way of thestatehouse rather than Congress.   Yet at the same time the Massachusetts governor does not have todefend a record not of his own making, and he has a relativelyclean slate on which to write his own doctrines. And he doesn'tlack for self-confidence; while he is being urged to select a vicepresident with foreign-policy expertise, Dukakis says his secretaryof state will handle those chores.   In the interview, Dukakis _ who speaks Spanish, Greek and Frenchbut has not traveled extensively _ acknowledged that he haslearning to do.   ``Of course. You never stop learning in politics,'' he said.``You work at this all the time. But I also have some ratherstrongly held views on the subject of American foreign policy. AndI think if you're going to run for the presidency, you've got aresponsibility to express those views, and to do so with as muchinformation and knowledge as you can possibly pull together.''   As for his own views, Dukakis is most emphatic on two points:ending the shooting in Central America and turning the U.S.-Sovietrelationship into a peaceful blend of rivalry and cooperation.   ``There's no question that managing that relationship is goingto be probably the single most important foreign policyresponsibility the president has,'' Dukakis said.   ``The next president of the United States will probably have thebest opportunity in our lifetimes to make real progress in not onlybuilding that relationship but on arms control and arms reduction,on reducing and eliminating regional conflict, on making thecompetition peaceful and not military between the two superpowers.''</TEXT></DOC>
