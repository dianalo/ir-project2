Paley's estatewill decide to sell the late CBS Inc. chairman's 8 percent stake inthe media company.   But CBS executives and media analysts said even if the stockwere sold, chances were slim it could lead to an unfriendly bid forcontrol of the company, a frequent subject of takeover rumors.   The Wall Street Journal reported a sale of the stock seemslikely, partly because the Paley estate, valued at about $500million, must raise $190 million to cover tax obligations.   Pat Gallagher, executive director of the William S. PaleyFoundation and one of six executors of the Paley estate, said hecould not confirm the tax liability figure but called suggestionsthe stock may be sold ``pure speculation.''   CBS stock closed up 50 cents at $158.62{ on the New York StockExchange Wednesday. It traded as high as $162 earlier in the day.   Paley, longtime chairman of CBS, died last month. Much of hisestate including 1.9 million shares of CBS stock valued at nearly$300 million is to be divided among his six children.   But the Journal quoted unidentified people familiar with thesituation as saying the Paley estate's executors may vote next weekon whether to sell the CBS holdings.   ``We will probably sell that whole block to pay the bills,'' oneof the people, described as knowledgable about the estate'sfinances, was quoted as saying in the Journal account.   Arthur Liman, another executor of the Paley estate, said theexecutors have made no decisions on how to handle the estate's taxliability.   He said the executors meet regularly, but that no specialmeeting has been set yet on what to do with the CBS stock.   Gallagher noted that the estate also includes numerous othersecurities and investments, including artwork and real estate, thatcould be used to satisfy any tax obligations.   CBS spokesman George Schweitzer said even if the stock weresold, it would not be something that could affect control of CBS.   CBS president and chief executive Laurence A. Tisch controlsLoews Corp. and its 24.9 percent stake in CBS. That stake, combinedwith stock held by employees and investors who support Tischeffectively blocks any unwelcome bids for control of the company,media analysts say.   State takeover laws in New York, where CBS is based, require anunfriendly bid to win the support of two-thirds of a company'scommon stock.   ``Tisch has de facto control of CBS,'' said John Reidy, whofollows the media business for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   Company executives say privately that Tisch is committed toimproving CBS' performance in the primetime television audienceratings where it trails NBC and he is unlikely to sell - if he everdoes - before accomplishing that.   The depressed state of media stocks might make them seematractive investments. But media analysts say the low stock valuesstem from weak advertising revenues and restrictions that limit TVnetworks' financial stakes in the programming they carry, making itan inopportune time for a takeover.</TEXT></DOC>
