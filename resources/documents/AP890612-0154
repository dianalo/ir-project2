Haughey called Thursday's election after a defeat in the Dail, orparliament, where his major policies have been supported by the mainopposition parties.   A poll published Monday by The Irish Times showed Haughey'sFianna Fail party with 47 percent support, down from 50 percent inlate May. Another, for the Sunday Independent, showed 45 percentsupporting Fianna Fail, a drop of 2 percent within a week.   Margins of error were 3 percent.   ``The polls are giving very confused signals. As I read the pollsthere is a slow, strong swing toward Fianna Fail in the closingstage of this campaign,'' Haughey told a news conference Monday.   In Dublin betting shops, however, Haughey's chances to return asTaoiseach, or prime minister, slipped to 7-1 from a 10-1 favorite,and the odds on Fianna Fail winning a majority went from 4-1 for to6-4 against.   A poll conducted in May for The Irish Times found 93 percent ofthose questioned rated unemployment a ``very important'' issue.Other rated issues were cuts in government health programs, 82percent; emigration, 76 percent; and poverty, 70 percent.   Haughey, 63, called the election May 25 following hisgovernment's sixth defeat in the Dail since it took office in March1987. The administration had opposed creating a $540,000 fund forhemophiliacs who contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome fromblood transfusions.   Haughey said the defeat convinced him opposition parties wereprepared to combine against Fianna Fail on certain issues.   His administration had survived through the tacit support of theFine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, a faction that broke fromFianna Fail.   When the Dail was dissolved, Fianna Fail had 80 seats, Fine Gael50, the Progressive Democrats 14, the Labor Party 11 and others 8.Two seats are vacant.   Haughey needs 83 seats for a majority in the 166-seat parliament.The speaker automatically is returned and traditionally supports thegovernment.   Confident of winning, Haughey opened with a positive campaignemphasizing the government's record of fiscal prudence and economicrecovery.   During his term, interest rates dropped to 9 percent, 5 pointslower than in Britain, and inflation to a modest 3.5 percent. Thebudget deficit was pared from 15 percent of gross national productin 1981 to about 5 percent.   Those gains, however, come at the cost of continued highunemployment of 17.5 percent, and emigration, largely of youngjob-seekers, has accelerated to 40,000 a year.   Haughey's cuts in public spending hit hard at Fianna Fail'straditional rural and blue-collar support. Last week, Haugheyadmitted being surprised at the intensity of anger about cuts inpublic health services.   Despite Haughey's problems, support for the combination of FineGael and the Progressive Democrats reached only 34 percent in thefinal poll of The Irish Times.   About 2.4 million people are eligible to vote and 367 candidatesare running in 41 constituencies.</TEXT></DOC>
