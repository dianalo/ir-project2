Although the reactor is very quiet, some interestingfeatures were observed: autospectra that increase in amplitude at lowfrequencies and exhibit a relatively broad resonant peak at about 0.3Hz; coherence between all measured locations that shows a relativelybroad peak with a value of about 0.8 at 0.3 Hz; zero phase shifts betweendetectors placed at a common position along the flow stream; linear phaseshifts at low frequencies for detectors placed in an upstream/downstreamconfiguration whether or not the detectors are in the same radial locationand regardless of the radial locations of the detectors; and a spaceand time dependent resonant feature at about 1.4 Hz which has strongcoherence between selected detectors. Computer calculations were madeto explain some of these observations with only limited success. Thispaper discusses the results achieved up to this time.</TEXT></DOC>
