Releasing today its annual rating of the top 100 militarycontractors, the Pentagon said McDonnell Douglas substantiallywidened its lead over General Dynamics Corp. and General ElectricCo. in fiscal 1988 because contract totals declined for the thesecond- and third-ranked contractors.   St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas received military contractsworth $8 billion in fiscal 1988, up from $7.7 billion in fiscal 1987and far ahead of the $6.5 won by No. 2 General Dynamics.   GE received military contracts worth $5.7 billion in fiscal 1988.   General Dynamics Pentagon business declined from $7 billion infiscal 1987 to $6.5 billion last year, while GE's business declinedfrom $5.8 billion to $5.7 billion.   The remainder of the Top 10 in fiscal 1988 included Tenneco Inc.,with $5.1 billion; Raytheon Co. with $4.1 billion; Martin MariettaCorp. with $3.7 billion; General Motors Corp. with $3.6 billion;Lockheed Corp. with $3.54 billion; United Technologies Corp. with$3.51 billion, and the Boeing Co. with $3 billion.   The report, entitled ``100 Companies Receiving the Largest DollarVolume of Prime Contract Awards,'' covers the fiscal year endinglast Sept. 30, and is considered the most definitive gauge of howmajor military contractors are faring each year.   The report discloses the Pentagon's contractors were fightingover a smaller pie in fiscal 1988, with prime contracts totaling$137 billion being parceled out. That is $5.5 billion less than thetotal awarded in fiscal 1987.   The top 100 companies, as a group, saw their share of thosecontracts decline last year. The 100 firms received $90.1 billion ofthe contracts, or 65.8 percent of the total, compared to $95.4billion and 66.9 percent in fiscal 1987.   ``The smallest total amount received by a company in the fiscal1988 list was $129 million, compared to $122 million in fiscal1987,'' the Pentagon added.   The biggest change in the fiscal 1988 rankings was the rise ofTenneco, a company that ranked 13th in fiscal 1987. Tenneco's jumpto fourth in the rankings was based on orders from the Navy for twonuclear-powered aircraft carriers received by the Newport NewsShipbuilding andamp; Drydock Co., a wholly owned subsidiary.   This was the second consecutive year that McDonnell Douglasranked first. McDonnell Douglas reclaimed the No. 1 ranking infiscal 1987 after being shouldered aside the year earlier by GeneralDynamics.   Some of McDonnell's larger contracts include the F-A-18 Hornetfighter for the Navy; the F-15 Eagle for the Air Force; the AH-64Apache helicopter gunship for the Army, and the AV-8B Harrier jumpjet for the Marine Corps. The company also builds Tomahawk andHarpoon missile systems.</TEXT></DOC>
