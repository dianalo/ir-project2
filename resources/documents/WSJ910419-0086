A team of scientists at the U.S. government researchlaboratories in Bethesda, Md., and Transgene S.A., a Frenchbiotech company, said the technique could lead to a treatmentfor two of the most common genetic diseases, an inheritedform of the respiratory ailment emphysema and cysticfibrosis. The new experiment is the most recent in a cascadeof recent developments suggesting that scientists may somedaycreate a range of therapies based on implanting healthy genesto replace defective, disease-causing ones.</LP><TEXT>   In the experiment, the scientists delivered a human genewhich, if defective, causes inherited emphysema, a conditionthat affects about 20,000 to 40,000 Americans. They foundthat once the gene was placed inside lung tissue, it churnedout a chemical protein that normally protects people againstthe disease.   &quot;I am convinced the technique would work in humans,&quot; saidDr. Ronald G. Crystal, chief of pulmonary studies at theNational Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. &quot;But we have got toprove that it is safe, and that will be a major hurdle.&quot;   The safety issue is significant because the scientistsdelivered the healthy gene into the lung using a virus -- theadenovirus -- that is responsible for causing common colds.In a paper in the journal Science, the researchers said theyextracted the part of the adenovirus that causes a cold, andinserted into it the human protective gene. But thescientists said introducing such an engineered virus into thehuman body could cause any number of unforeseen problems.   Scientists tinkering with ways to deliver genes to thebody -- methods often referred to as gene therapy -- aretesting various types of viruses as potential gene carriers.That is because viruses infect cells by inserting theirgenetic material into a cell. Dr. Crystal said that previousgene therapy experiments have used viruses that are eitherpotentially too dangerous to use in humans, or can't be usedfor technical reasons in lung tissue and in many other organswith similar tissue.   In the experiment, the scientists implanted a gene thatnormally signals cells in the lung to produce a proteincalled alpha-1-antitrypsin. The protein normally protectscells that make up the lungs' air sacs from an enzyme thatcirculates in the bloodstream. People born with a non-workingform of the gene don't make the protein. Over the course ofmany years, the enzyme slowly erodes the air sacs, thuscausing the lung disease. People who smoke or work or live industy environments are especially vulnerable to developingemphysema if they are born with the defect.   In a telephone interview from London, Dr. Crystal saidscientists are close to duplicating the experiment using thegene for cystic fibrosis. That disease, affecting about30,000 Americans, is the most common of all lethal geneticillnesses, producing severe breathing and digestive problemsthat arise in young children.   Late last year, scientists at the University of Michiganreplaced defective cystic fibrosis genes in cells removedfrom lung tissue. But that experiment was conducted inculture dishes outside the body and used a virus calledvaccinia that some researchers believe is too dangerous foruse in humans.   In the current experiment, scientists squirted theengineered adenovirus into the lungs of rats. However, Dr.Crystal said a human therapy might use an aerosol spray. Hesaid the scientists have also used the adenovirus to carrythe alpha-1antitrypsin gene into the livers of rats,suggesting that the virus might be useful in repairing a widerange of genetic diseases involving the liver.   Last year, scientists at the National Institutes of Healthconducted the first sets of human gene therapy tests,treating patients with cancer, and a young girl with a genedefect that causes a rare immune problem. Neither of themethods used in those cases are applicable to the most commonof inherited diseases.</TEXT></DOC>
