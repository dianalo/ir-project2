Obstacles to the manoeuvrability of theexcavator are considered. This is done by selecting suitable pillar workingtechnologies, moving around return ends, and choosing a straight movingtrajectory of the excavator during operation. All of these assumptionswill influence the final result. (MOS).</TEXT></DOC>
