GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Calling it toxic waste dumping and thesecond Opium War, anti-smoking crusaders in Asia have accusedAmerican tobacco interests of moving to reverse victories scoredagainst the cigarette by targeting the booming Pacific Rim as a keymarket.   The American companies, faced with anti-smoking regulations thatdepress profits in the United States, say the budding anti-smokingmovement in Asia is an excuse for trade protectionism.   American cigarettes entered the once closed markets of SouthKorea, Japan and Taiwan in 1986 and now tobacco companies aretrying to penetrate Thailand. American cigarettes historically havebeen hot sellers in Hong Kong.   Asian smoking opponents claim the American hard sell and slickads equating smoking with the good life will create a newgeneration of smoking addicts, especially women and teen-agers.   ``Smoking foreign cigarettes has become a symbol of money andsocial status,'' the China Pictorial Magazine stated recently,noting the price of a couple of cartons of Marlboros equal aChinese professor's monthly salary.   In Taiwan, an anti-smoking group called John Tung's Foundationclaims smoking has soared among teen-agers because of hard-selltactics by American tobacco companies. Eight-five percent ofyouthful puffers prefer imports, the Tung group says.   In a letter to President Bush earlier this year, health groupsfrom nine Asian countries described the American push as ``amockery of your country's efforts to curb the export of otheraddictive drugs into your country.''   Activists have likened the American blitz to last century'sOpium War when Britain forcefully flooded China with opium from itscolony India and made addicts out of millions.   Those favoring increased exports, such as Congressman RobinTallon of South Carolina, a major tobacco-growing state, contendAsians will continue to buy cigarettes with or without Americanpresence.   ``The real issue is whether American companies will be allowedto compete, or if the playing field is abandoned to other foreignmanufacturers and local monopolies,'' he said.   The U.S. Cigarette Export Association notes as part of itsargument that cigarettes contributed a record $3.5 billion to helpreduce the U.S. trade deficit in 1988.   The U.S. Trade Office is threatening Thailand with tradepenalties if it does not lower its import tax and other barriers toAmerican cigarettes. It is seeking the reversal of laws under whichcigarette advertising was sharply restricted in 1979 and virtuallyeliminated from mass media this year.   Thai anti-smoking lobbyists, some of whom recently testified inWashington, say their stand against American cigarettes is not asmokescreen for protectionism.   ``My bottom line is anti-smoking. I don't care if it's Thai orAmerican cigarettes,'' said Dr. Prakit Vatee-Satokit of the ThaiAnti-Smoking Campaign Project. ``I see people die of smoking everyday.''   Prakit said he is concerned that a full-scale American entrywill target youth and women. In a smoking profile typical of manyAsian nations, only 3.5 percent of Thai women were said to smoke in1988 vs. 46.6 percent of males.   Led by 250 million Chinese, Asians remain among the world's mostprolific puffers and account for 44 percent of global cigaretteproduction. Governments take in hefty revenues from statemonopolies and cigarette import taxes and thus are reluctant totake too tough a stand against their domestic industries.   But private pressure groups and governments in some Asiancountries, inspired partly by the American anti-smoking movement,have made some notable gains in the tobacco war.   Led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, a doctor turnedpolitician, Malaysia banned smoking in government offices in 1982and all hospitals this year. Cigarette advertisements on televisionand radio, both government controlled, have been replaced bymessages about smoking's harmful effects.   But the Asian-Pacific Conference on Cigarette Smoking andHealth, which sent the letter to Bush, said American cigarettepromoters in Malaysia still place television ads for such things as``Kent Travel Bags'' and ``Tours of Marlboro Country'' in whichviewers are asked to call a local travel agency if they wish tovisit ``Marlboro Country.''   Prakit says the number of Thai smokers has fallen sharply since1976, partly because of an increased awareness of the health risks.The country beat the United States in forbidding smoking on alldomestic airline flights, a regulation that took effect this year.   Anti-smoking campaigners got to Prime Minister ChatichaiChoonhavan who gave up his trademark cigars recently. He's jokedthat his sex life has since improved.   Other Asian leaders have set examples. Singapore's Lee Kuan Yewabhors smoking in his presence and Philippines President CorazonAquino has banned it at Cabinet meetings.   Those who light up on Singapore's buses, trains and taxis facefines of up to $250. But in the Philippines the macho Marlboro Manstill rides tall as television audiences are bombarded with thisand other American cigarette ads long banned in the United States.   Hong Kong, where American smokes dominate 70 percent of market,cigarette advertising is banned on prime time TV and will be bannedfrom all programming by 1990. Controversy continues in the Britishcolony and elsewhere in Asia over tobacco industry sponsorships ofsports and cultural programs.   Anti-smoking has made little headway in Japan and China and onlysome in South Korea, where critics say American cigarettes are themost heavily advertised products in the country although the marketshare of imported cigarettes is still only about 4 percent.   In China, where relatively expensive American cigarettes havecaptured only a miniscule percentage of the market, the governmenthas not even imposed health warnings on packs. Top leader DengXiaoping is a prolific smoker and is often photographed puffing ona domestic `Panda'' brand.   One flicker of interest was Beijing's participation in the firstWorld Anti-Smoking Day last April. Stalls in the city sold``anti-smoking ointments,'' ``quit smoking mouth gargles'' andbattery powered electrodes attached to the cheeks and activatedeach time the user gets an urge to smoke.   In Japan, where more than 60 percent of the people smoke, amongthe few places where smokers cannot indulge are undergroundplatforms of Tokyo's subway system. The sides of cigarette packscarry the faintly printed admonition: ``Be careful not to smoke toomuch for your health.''   Japan remains one of the few industrialized nations to allowcigarette advertising on TV, where popular foreign actors such asJames Coburn and Roger Moore promote smoking's glamorous image.   The American incursion does not appear to have significantlyaffected smoking in Japan. But the Asian-Pacific conference claimedthat since the market was opened to Americans in 1987, cigaretteads on Tokyo television rose from No. 40 to second place in totalair time.   Japanese companies, the conference reported, have responded tostepped-up competition by copying Western-style advertising andconcocting new products. These include a women-oriented brand,``Misty,'' and another called ``Dean,'' named after deceasedAmerican actor James Dean, an idol among Japanese youth.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday Oct. 29</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
