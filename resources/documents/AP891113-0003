(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dartmouth College will sell off $11.5million worth of investments in companies doing business in SouthAfrica by the end of the year, the Board of Trustees announcedMonday.   The Ivy League school, which has been a hot spot in the debatein this country over South Africa's apartheid policies, will alsorefrain from such investments in the future, the board said in astatement.   Dartmouth President James Freedman read the announcement at afaculty meeting, and 250 to 300 students who were present cheered.   The board said the investments have ``great symbolic meaning,''and that disputes over them undermine Dartmouth's ability toachieve some educational goals.   ``The trustees recognize that many firms continuing to dobusiness in South Africa are making positive contributions to thelives of their employees and the political process in SouthAfrica,'' the statement said.   The board said it made the decision to divest Saturday afterdiscussing the adverse impact of ``these nominal investments.''   Dartmouth's investments in companies doing business in SouthAfrica have declined from $63 million, or 15 percent of itsendowment, to $11.5 million, or less than 2 percent, the board said.   After the announcement, Heetan Kalan, a sophomore who heads theInternational Student Association on campus, said, ``I'mspeechless. It's a great victory.''   A representative of the African National Congress who has workedfor 15 years to get Dartmouth to divest its South Africaninvestments said he still can't believe the fight is over.   Themba Ntinga, a representative to the United Nations for theANC, was at the school Monday to debate Peter Soal, a member ofSouth Africa's Parliament. Both men had been invited to Dartmouthbefore the decision to divest.   ``It's totally unexpected,'' said Ntinga, whose organization isoutlawed in South Africa. ``It's a sweet victory for the principlesof fairness.   ``This not only will send a message to (South Africa), but alsoto the racist South African Parliament itself,'' he said.   Divestment had not been on the agenda for the trustees' weekendmeeting. Freedman said he did not think a weekend protest duringthe trustees' meeting had anything to do with the decision.   By law and custom, South Africa's apartheid policy establishes aracially segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have novote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economyand maintain separate districts, schools and health services.   Since 1972, Dartmouth has adopted investment policies thatincluded prohibitions against investments in South Africancompanies, financial institutions making loans to the South Africangovernment, companies supplying goods and services involved inenforcing apartheid and companies doing business in South Africathat didn't adhere to certain employment practices.   In November 1985, students built shanties on Dartmouth Green toprotest apartheid. The following January, 12 students, includingnine members of the off-campus Dartmouth Review, attacked theshanties with sledgehammers, saying the school should not be heldhostage by any group and that the shanties were erected illegally.   Dartmouth pressured the students to move the shanties offcampus. The last one was removed that February after the collegehad 18 students who stood in the way arrested. Dartmouth droppedall charges against the 18.   Also in 1985, some faculty members urged gradual divestment. Thecollege began reducing its investments that year. Faculty membersagain urged divestment last year.</TEXT></DOC>
