In a silviculturally correct forest-management system,&quot;clear-cutting&quot; replaces natural processes such as insectinfestation, wildfire and old-age decline as the method toregenerate forest land. &quot;Clearcutting&quot; as it is currentlypracticed on federal land and most corporate forest land isaccomplished on an &quot;interdisciplinary basis.&quot; Soilscientists, soil hydrologists, wildlife biologists, fisheriesbiologists, silvicultural experts (foresters), botanists andentomologists all must enmesh their prospective disciplinesto ensure that all resources are conserved during harvestingand that a clear-cut site will be completely regenerated to anew stand within five years.</LP><TEXT>   Properly practiced clear-cutting absolutely does notresult in the following: &quot;forest crisis, ecological threats,wastelands, eradicated wildlife habitat, eroded topsoil,fouled spawning beds, last stroke against biointegrity,despoiling, ruination of nearby streams, devastation orlasting damage&quot; as alluded to in your article.   Mark Garnett   Vice President   Garnett Wood Products Co.   Brandsville, Mo.   ---   Reading your article about the forests of Prince WilliamSound, I was struck by an inference increasingly common inthe press that forest clear-cutting is inherently bad.   Clear-cutting can result in two distinctly differentbiological results, depending on where and how it is applied:reforestation or deforestation.   In its application to obtain reforestation, it is animportant and valid option. For many tree species whereintensive forest management to maximize forest productivityis practiced, clear-cutting is used to recover and use allmerchantable timber from a site prior to planting. Often,planting is the only method of stand regeneration that willconsistently result in restocking with appropriate speciesand suitable spacing. In these situations, where cutting isdone according to environmentally sound logging practices, nosignificant erosion or site degradation occurs.   Certain other tree species require large openings in theforest to reproduce naturally. Many Eastern hardwoods, forexample, fall in this category. Here, again, clear-cutting isthe preferred method of reforestation.   Where neither planting nor satisfactory naturalregeneration occurs, deforestation is the result ofclear-cutting. Too often, the term &quot;clear-cutting&quot; isemployed where what we really intend to say is&quot;deforestation.&quot;   W.D. Ticknor   Director of Woodlands   Mead   Dayton, Ohio</TEXT></DOC>
