MR-CT was more satisfactory than X-rayCT in delineating tumors (95 % vs 86 %). ''False positive'' was detectedfor the invasion to the neighboring organs on X-ray CT in 5 patientsas compared with one patient on MR-CT, indicating the potential of MR-CTin ruling out ''false positive'' observed on X-ray CT. In diagnosinglymph node metastases, MR-CT was superior to X-ray CT in terms of itsability to visualize blood vessels without contrast media and small lymphnodes on inversion recovery pulse sequences. MR-CT may serve as an adjuvanttool for preoperatively diagnosing rectal carcinoma. (Namekawa, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
