(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state constitution says Louis Peck istoo old to be on Vermont's highest court. Peck disagrees, andcontinues to hear and decide cases.   ``I don't think I should become senile as a matter of law,''said Peck. ``I might be as a matter of fact, but certainly not oflaw.''   Peck turned 70 in December. According to Vermont's Constitution,he should have retired at the end of 1988. He did not, believingthe provision violates a federal act that prohibits agediscrimination.   On his side is an opinion from the state attorney general'soffice saying the federal act supercedes the Vermont mandatoryretirement clause. But a recent federal appeals court ruling inMassachusetts raises new questions about Peck's standing.   ``We have an attorney general's opinion that concludes JusticePeck is qualified to sit,'' said Thomas Lehner, the courtadministrator. ``Whether the attorney general's opinion is correctis an open question.''   The 1974 provision of the state Constitution is clear: ``Alljustices of the Supreme Court and judges of all subordinate courtsshall be retired at the end of the calendar year in which theyattain 70 years of age.''   But in 1986 Congress amended the Age Discrimination inEmployment Act of 1967 to prohibit discrimination regardless ofage. Previously, the law did not apply to anyone older than 70.   In 1987, Peck and Gov. Madeleine Kunin asked the attorneygeneral's office to review the apparent conflict between the stateConstitution and federal law. In an opinion signed by AttorneyGeneral Jeffrey Amestoy, the office decided the federal law mustprevail.   ``The supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution makes it clearfederal law controls if there is a conflict,'' said Amestoy.   But rulings by the attorney general's office do not have theforce of a court decision; they are only advisory. And a federalcourt decision in neighboring Massachusetts late last year showsthere is room for disagreement.   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, which coversMassachusetts, said it could not find any evidence in reviewing thecongressional debate on the discrimination statute that Congressmeant for the law to usurp the state power to govern the tenure ofjudges.   ``Without question, the tenure of state judges is a question ofexceeding importance to each state, and a question traditionallyleft to be answered by each state,'' the judges said. ``Any federalencroachment on a state freedom of choice in this area, therefore,strikes very close to the heart of state sovereignity.''   Peck feels strongly that age alone is not a good barometer ofability and noted that justices on the U.S. Supreme Court routinelyserve well past 70.   ``Oliver Wendell Holmes served very well on the U.S. SupremeCourt until he was well into his 90s,'' Peck said in an interviewthis week.   Peck wants the issue resolved in the courts. But it is unclearhow or when that will happen.   The Massachusetts ruling has no force in Vermont. Only a rulingby the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Vermont, or bythe U.S. Supreme Court, could end the uncertainty over Peck'sposition.   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, on behalf of judgessuch as Peck across the country, is looking for a case to bring tothe U.S. Supreme Court to resolve the issue, but it may be yearsbefore the country's highest court issues a decision.   Meanwhile, Peck continues to review cases with the four otherjustices. Lehner said it is believed that Peck's rulings will standeven if a court eventually rules he should have retired at age 70.   ``Obviously we are concerned because this is an opensituation,'' he said. ``We have talked with Justice Peck aboutsetting up a federal suit, but right now we are relying on theattorney general's opinion that he can sit.''   Peck said he has three more years in his term and would thenhave to seek legislative retention to continue on the court. Hesaid he might consider retiring before his term is up, but only ifthe issue is settled.   ``I am not doing this for my sake,'' he said. ``I'm doing thisfor the people who will come after. I am determined to stay onuntil this is resolved.''</TEXT></DOC>
