For both cases, the value of the substantial amountof contained carbon dioxide has not been realized. This has been dueto the impurities which present a significant obstacle to the economicproduction of merchant grade carbon dioxide. This paper presents twoprocesses which make use of an oxygen fed combustion step to reduce boththe quantity and variety of impurities which must be removed to meetcarbon dioxide product specifications. The two processes produce carbondioxide and electricity or carbon dioxide and pipeline quality methane,respectively. Anticipated net liquid carbon dioxide manufacturing costsare presented.</TEXT></DOC>
