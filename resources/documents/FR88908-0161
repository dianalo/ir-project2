However, it appears that some of these issues are not explainedsufficiently in the published notices, and that the requirements applyingto the number of new and different NIDRR programs are confusing.These questions and answers are meant to be informative, and are not regulatoryrequirements in and of themselves.1. Can I Get An Extension of the Due Date?No! On rare occasions the Department of Education may extend a closingdate for all applicants. If that occurs, a notice of the revised due dateis published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> However, there are no extensions or exceptionsto the due date made for individual applicants.Further information about mailing is included in Section IV of this ConsolidatedApplication Package.2. What Should Be Included in the Application?The applicant should include the materials specified in Section IV of thisConsolidated Application Package. Specifically, the application shouldinclude a project narrative, vitae of key personnel, and a budget, as wellas the Assurances forms included in this package. Vitae of staff or consultantsshould include the individual's title and role in the proposed project,and other information that is specifically pertinent to this proposed project.The budgets for both the first year and subsequent project years shouldbe included.If collaboration with another organization is involved in the proposedactivity, the application should include assurances of participation bythe other parties, including written agreements or assurances of cooperation.It is <T3>not </T3>useful to include general letters of support or endorsementin the application.If the applicant proposes to use unique tests or other measurement instrumentsthat are not widely known in the field, it would be helpful to includethe instrument in the application.Many applications contain voluminous appendices that are helpful and inmany cases cannot even be mailed to the reviewers. It is generally nothelpful to include such things as brochures, general capability statementsof collaborating organizations, maps, copies of publications, or descriptionsof other projects completed by the applicant.3. What Format Should Be Used for the Application?NIDRR generally advises applicants that they may organize the applicationto follow the selection criteria that will be used. The specific reviewcriteria vary according to the specific program, and are contained in thisConsolidated Application Package.4. May I Submit Applications to More Than One Program Competition in NIDRRor More Than One Application to a Program?Yes, you may submit applications to any program for which they are responsiveto the program requirements. You may submit the same application to asmany competitions as you believe appropriate. You may also submit morethan one application in any given competition.5. What is the Allowable Indirect Cost Rate?The limits on indirect costs vary according to the program and the typeof application.Applications for Rehabilitation Research and Training Centers should limitindirect cost rates to fifteen percent of the grant award, as noted inthe program regulations and statute.Applications in other programs that are for training activities shouldlimit indirect charges to the lesser of the actual indirect costs or eightpercent of the total direct costs of the program, as noted in the EducationDepartment General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR).All other applicants should limit indirect charges to the organization'sapproved rate. If the organization does not have an approved rate, theapplication should include an estimated actual rate.6. Can Profitmaking Businesses Apply for Grants?Yes. However, for-profit organizations will not be able to collect a feeor profit on the grant, and in some programs will be required to sharein the costs of the project.7. Can Individuals Apply for Grants?No. Only organizations are eligible to apply for grants under NIDRR programs.8. Can Universities Apply Under the Fellowship Program?No. Only individuals are eligible to apply for fellowships under the regulationsgoverning that program.9. Is there a Cost-Sharing or Matching Requirement?Cost-sharing is required in the Research and Demonstration Projects program,with certain exceptions noted in the law, the Knowledge Dissemination andUtilization program, the Field-Initiated Research program, and the CareerDevelopment and Research Training program.There are no cost-sharing requirements for the Innovation Grants or theResearch Fellowship programs.For the Rehabilitation Research and Training Centers and the RehabilitationEngineering Centers, the Secretary has the option to require matching.It is generally the practice of the agency to require cost-sharing underthese programs.There is no set rate for cost-sharing. The cost-sharing is negotiated atthe time an award is made and is not part of the evaluation of the application.10. What Are the Priorities in the Field-Initiated or Innovation GrantsPrograms?There are no priorities in either the Field-Initiated Research or InnovationGrants programs. Applicants are free to submit applications in areas ofinterest to the investigator as long as they are related to the purposesof the program as described in the regulations.11. Can NIDRR Staff Advise Me Whether My Project Is of Interest to NIDRRor Likely To Be Funded?No. NIDRR staff can advise you of the requirements of the program in whichyou propose to submit your application. However, staff cannot advise youof whether your subject area is likely to receive approval in the investigator-initiatedcompetitions.12. How Do I Assure That My Application Will Be Referred to the Most AppropriatePanel for Review?Applicants should be sure that their applications are referred to the correctcompetitions by clearly including the competition title and CFDA number,including alphabetical code, on the Standard Form 424.Applicants should assist NIDRR in ensuring that their Field-Initiated andInnovation Grant applications are referred to the most appropriate panelsby emphasizing the focus of the proposed activity in the abstract of theproject on the Standard Form 424. It would be helpful if the applicantwould not use acronyms in the title and abstract, unless those acronymsare in common usage nationally.13. How Soon After Submitting My Application Can I Find Out if it WillBe Funded?The time from closing date to grant award date varies from program to programand for other reasons. Generally speaking, NIDRR endeavors to have awardsmade within five to six months of the closing date. Unsuccessful applicantsgenerally will be notified within that time frame as well. For the purposeof estimating a project start date, the applicant should estimate approximatelysix months from the closing date, but no later than the following September30.14. Can I Call NIDRR To Find Out if My Application Is Being Funded?No! When NIDRR is able to release information on the status of grant applications,it will notify applicants by letter. The results of the peer review cannotbe released except through this formal notification.15. If My Application Is Successful, Can I Assume I Will Get the RequestedBudget Amount in Subsequent Years?No. Those budget projections are necessary and helpful for planning purposes.However, a complete budget and budget justification must be submitted foreach year of the project and there will be negotiations on the budget eachyear.16. Will All Approved Applications Be Funded?No. It often happens that the peer review panels approve for funding moreapplications than NIDRR can fund within available resources. Applicantswho are approved but not funded are encouraged to consider submitting similarapplications in future competitions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section IV Application Instructions and Forms</ITAG>This application is divided into three parts.
