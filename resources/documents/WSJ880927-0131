Boesky, have agreed in principle to settle part of their suits.    Such a settlement would provide the first payments to shareholders claiming losses as a result of insider trading by a Boesky-controlled organization. According to attorneys for the shareholders and the partnerships, the agreement will be filed soon in federal court in New York, where it will be subject to approval by Judge Milton Pollack.    Terms call for a group of class-action shareholders to receive some of the $50 million that is available in a fund established for individuals and companies that can prove they had financial damages because of the insider trading by the Boesky partnerships. Among those partnerships is Cambrian and General Securities PLC, a British investment fund.    Stocks involved in the shareholder suits include General Foods Corp., RJR Nabisco, Houston Natural Gas, FMC Corp., American Natural Resources, Boise Cascade Corp. and Union Carbide Corp.    Lawyers for the partnerships and the shareholders say the proposed settlement affects a total of seven suits filed in 1986 and 1987. While the settlement would remove the partnerships as defendants in those suits, it would still leave Mr. Boesky as a defendant in all of them. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Mr. Boesky's principal underwriter, also would remain as a defendant in some of the cases.    Meanwhile, lawyers for FMC filed an amended complaint in Chicago late Friday against Mr. Boesky and others. As previously reported, a federal appeals court in July overturned a lower court's dismissal of an earlier suit. FMC is alleging insider trading, misuse of information and price manipulation in connection with its $2 billion recapitalization in 1986.    Richard Franch, an attorney for FMC, said that the amended complaint &quot;incorporates allegations&quot; in the SEC's recent civil action against Drexel and others. Besides Mr. Boesky and companies affiliated with him, the amended complaint named former investment bankers David Brown, Ira Sokolow and Dennis Levine. It also named Drexel, Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., now Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
