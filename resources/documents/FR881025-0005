Part 704 was promulgated in 1977 to define a corporate creditunion (herein referred to as a corporate) and to establish a reserve accountfor corporate credit unions. The regulation was revised in 1979 and againin 1984 to provide additional requirements pertaining to operations ofcorporate credit unions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment</ITAG>The NCUA Board issued a proposed rule on May 20, 1988 (see 53 FR 20122,(June 2, 1988)). The Board received 15 comments in response to the proposalto amend Part 704. Of the 15 comments, 7 were from Federally charteredcorporates, 4 from state-chartered Federally insured corporates, 1 froma state-chartered non-insured corporate, 1 from a state credit union supervisor,1 from a natural person Federal credit union and 1 from a trade association.A discussion of the comments received on the proposed amendments follows:A. Proposal to Amend andSection; 704.2 To Include a Definition of ``AverageDaily Assets'' in the RegulationSix of the commenters addressed the first proposal. Those who commentedfavored the change. The Board is adding paragraph (d) to andSection; 704.2to include the definition of average daily assets for reserve computationpurposes in the regulation itself. Corporate credit unions may elect eitherof two methods of calculating average daily assets. This is not a new requirement.The definition was formerly included only in the preamble to the regulation.B. Proposal To Amend andSection; 704.3 To Clarify Items That May Be Excludedfrom the Assets Prior to the Reserve Transfer ComputationThis section concerns establishment and maintenance of a corporate reserveagainst loan and certain investment losses. A total of 14 comments werereceived addressing this proposal. Eleven commenters concurred with thechange in andSection; 704.3 which clarifies the items that may be excludedfrom the assets prior to the reserve transfer computation.Two commenters believe the exclusion of reverse repurchase transactionsonly through US Central Credit Union is too narrowly defined. One commenterstated that they are ``extremely concerned as to the preferential statuswhich this exemption grants to transactions through US Central Credit Union.''Both agreed that reverse repurchase transactions through US Central shouldbe excluded but that the regulation should be expanded to exclude othermatched arbitrage transactions that inflate the balance sheet. One corporateurged NCUA to amend the regulations to exempt from the definition of assets,those assets involved in matched repurchase transactions with members ofthe corporate when the corporate executes the reverse repurchase transactiondirectly in the marketplace. This corporate also urged NCUA to reduce thecorporate reserve burden by permitting a reduction in average daily assetsas defined in the regulation by the amount of corporate-owned governmentsecurities involved in reverse repurchase transactions. The other corporateexpressed the opinion that all matched reverse repurchase agreements withbroker dealers ``which have a primary dealer status with the Federal ReserveBoard and are in compliance with the Federal Reserve's Capital AdequacyGuidelines for U.S. Government Security Dealers'' be excluded from averagedaily assets when computing reserve requirements. Reverse repurchase transactions on behalf of the members of a corporateusing the US Central corporate network program have been given a previousexemption because the corporates act primarily in an administrative capacityto forward securities to US Central Credit Union; the principal risks andprimary benefits are shared by US Central Credit Union and the naturalperson credit unions. NCUA does not intend this specific exemption to becomea precedent for all reverse repurchase transactions and believes that thesefinancing arrangements can and do involve factors that should be subjectto standard reserve requirements. Two other concerns were mentioned regarding Section 704.3(b). The firstis that all reserve levels stated in the regulation should be based onthe total of the Corporate Reserve and all undivided earnings. Section704.3(b) (1) and (2) both state that the reserve requirement is based uponthe credit union's ``Corporate Reserve and undivided earnings'' as a percentageof assets. The other concern is that NCUA should place a cap on reservetransfers when the ratio of the Corporate Reserve and undivided earningsto assets is 4 percent. This is implied in the regulation because no transferis required when the credit union's Corporate Reserve and undivided earningsis 4 percent or greater. C. Proposal To Amend andSection;704.5 To Specify That the Annual CPA AuditBe an Opinion Audit The NCUA Board's third proposed change was to Section 704.5 and was designedto clarify the intent of the required annual audit for corporate creditunions. All of the 8 commenters responding to this proposal favored theintent of the change although one commenter suggested that the wordingcould be clearer so as not to leave any question in the accounting professionconcerning the requirement. That commenter suggested a minor change withwording specific to the accounting profession. While the suggested wordingmay have merit, the Board believes that the intent is clear with the wordingof the proposed regulation. One commenter elaborated on andSection;704.5 by suggesting that, since aCPA audit would allow NCUA to place a greater amount of reliance on thefinancial statements taken as a whole, a supervisory fee credit shouldbe given for the cost of the certified audit, or a separate operating feeschedule should be developed for corporate credit unions which recognizestheir role as ``banker's banks''. This section of the regulation does notcover the supervision fees charged to a credit union. While there may besome overlap in an audit and an examination, the purposes are clearly different.All Federal credit unions are required to have an annual audit in additionto the annual supervisory examination; one does not exclude or reduce thefee of the other. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility ActThe NCUA Board certifies that the final rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small credit unions becauseall corporate credit unions have assets of at least $1,000,000. Accordingly,the Board has determined that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is notrequired.Paperwork Reduction ActThis final rule makes no changes to collection requirements, therefore,it need not be sent to the Office of Management and Budget for approval.Executive Order 12612Section 704.3 of the final regulation (corporate reserve requirements)is applicable to corporate Federally insured state chartered credit unions(Corporate FISCU's). This is not a new requirement. Corporate FISCU's mustreserve according to andSection; 704.3 only if their state law requires lowerreserves or allows for charges to reserves other than loan and investmentlosses provided by andSection; 704.3. NCUA has imposed this requirement onCorporate FISCU's as a condition of National Credit Union Share InsuranceFund Coverage. The Provision has previously been subject to public noticeand comment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 704</ITAG>Corporate Credit Unions.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the National Credit Union Administration Board on October 13, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of the Board.</ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA revises 12 CFR Part 704 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 704_CORPORATE CREDIT UNIONS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">704.1 Scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">704.2 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">704.3 Corporate reserve.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">704.4 Representation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">704.5 Annual audit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">704.6 Programs and services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">704.7 Prepayment penalties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>12 U.S.C. 1762, 1766(a), 1781 and 1789.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 704.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Scope.</ITAG>This part establishes certain special rules applying to Corporate Federalcredit unions and grants certain additional authorities to such creditunions.
