(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>IsiCAD Inc.andM;CADVANCE 4.0andM;IsiCAD has concentrated on networking more than any other CAD vendor.andP;  Theresult is that CADvance is the most network-aware package of those reviewed.andM;Although CADvance can run with all NetBIOS networks, it is optimized forNovell networks and includes specific instructions for both NetWare 286 andNetWare 386.andM;CADvance supports Network Loadable Modules (NLMs) on NetWare 386 forhidden-line removal and Structured Query Language (SQL) object selection.andO;Both of these rely on the horsepower of the server, rather than theworkstation.andP;  As a result, PC Week Labs found that background hidden-lineremoval can be slowed to a near crawl if the server is already heavily taxed.andO;However, CADvance allows the user to perform hidden-line removal locally.andM;CADvance's SQL database engine is a good example of client/serverarchitecture, which allows quick selection of object sets based on specificattributes held externally in dBASE-compatible DBF files.andP;  CADvance can alsoaccess these attribute databases without the SQL NLM, although withperformance degradation.andP;  A dBASE III Plus-compatible database is required tofully exploit CADvance attributes.andM;By handling plot-queue management internally, CADvance makes large plot jobsmuch easier and removes the need for a separate plotting station.andM;CADvance can be installed so that all files, or just shared files -- such asdrawings and symbols -- reside on the server.andP;  According to CADvance'sdocumentation, the latter configuration is typically faster, but in PC WeekLabs' tests, there was little practical difference except under heavy networktraffic.andP;  The fastest results were with the CADvance executable and overlayfiles in RAM disk.andM;Because CADvance requires 640K bytes of base RAM, its performance isintimately related to the amount of free RAM available.andP;  For all practicalpurposes, a memory manager is required to load network drivers above the640K-byte DOS area.andP;  CADvance requires at least 64K bytes of LIM expandedmemory; however, PC Week Labs tests found that at least 4M bytes of LIM EMSexpanded RAM with 2M bytes set aside for a RAM disk will provide betterperformance.andM;CADvance handles file locking and contention in a consistent, if nottransparent, manner.andP;  CADvance provides access control for all files -- notjust drawings -- associated with the program.andP;  The software even handlessubtle issues, such as running unattended scripts to access a locked filewhen it becomes available.andM;CADvance is the only network CAD program that will accept messages broadcastacross the network without scrambling the screen or hanging the system.andO;CADvance also supports peer-to-peer messaging under Novell.andP;  During testing,PC Week Labs was unable to induce any file-sharing or file-locking errors.andM;CADvance offers a mixed bag of file-management features.andP;  It lacks afront-end menu to select drawing files, but keeps basic project informationwithin each drawing, and individual password protection is available for eachdrawing.andM;LANtastic, from Artisoft Inc., was recently certified, but lacks someNovell-specific features, such as network licensing, peer-to-peer messagingand plot-queue management.andP;  Other NetBIOS networks will work as well asLANtastic, but are not yet certified by IsiCAD.andP;  CADvance uses a hardwaresecurity device that is encoded for a fixed number of users.andP;  The securitydevice attaches to a network workstation, but activates CADvance for use onany network workstation.andM;------------------&quot;VITAL SIGNS&quot; DATAandM;IsiCAD Inc.andM;Anaheim, Calif.andP;  (714) 533-8910andM;Privately heldandM;Year established: 1987andM;Number of employees: 300andM;Gross annual revenue:andM;not disclosedandM;Gross annual earnings:andM;not disclosedandM;Source.andP;  Information supplied by company.andM;----------PC Week Labs evaluated each of the CAD file programs on a Novell Inc.andO;NetWare 386 3.11 network.andP;  The test environment included an Advanced LogicResearch Inc. (ALR) PowerCache/4e 486/33 server with 8M bytes of RAM and a630M-byte hard-disk drive.andM;Workstations included two ALR BusinessVEISA 486/33 computers, an ArcheTechnologies Inc.andP;  386/33 and a Compaq Computer Corp.andP;  Deskpro 386s/20.andP;  TheALR and Arche computers had 8M bytes of RAM, and the Compaq had 6M bytes ofRAM.andP;  The networking hardware was Western Digital Inc.andP;  Ethernet cards.andM;Each of the programs included hardware locks or authorization codes for atleast two concurrent sessions.andP;  The programs were run both on local disks andon the network disk, where possible.andP;  Drawing files were also placed on bothlocal and network drives.andM;Performance speed was compared by loading the program and drawing files fromboth a local disk and a network drive.andP;  The test was repeated for both alightly loaded network and a heavily loaded one.andM;File-locking access control was examined by loading, editing, then saving thesame drawing on at least two workstations, in various overlapping orders.andO;With programs that supported reference files, a drawing was edited andreferenced simultaneously on two workstations.andP;  -- E.Y.andM;In any general sense, it is hard to pick the best CAD program.andP;  Each of theprograms in this review can lay claim to being the best at some particularfacet of computer-aided design.andP;  Nevertheless, in this review of networkcapability, there is a clear winner -- almost by default.andM;IsiCAD Inc.'s CADvance is the only CAD program to address network operationas an integral part of the package rather than an afterthought.andM;CADvance performs the basic function any user would expect when running a CADprogram on a network: protecting drawings from being damaged by concurrentaccess.andP;  However, it goes the extra mile, providing Structured Query Languageserver-based access to drawing attributes and background, server-based,hidden-line removal.andM;In between these two extremes, there are also many subtle attributes.andO;CADvance's list of features includes peer-to-peer messaging, even while theprogram is in the graphics screen, and provides users with control of theNovell NetWare print queue.andM;This is not to say that CADvance is not without flaws.andP;  It has limiteddrawing- and project-management capabilities.andP;  With CADvance, this isparticularly unfortunate, because IsiCAD could easily add the capabilities tothe program via a small front-end menu.andM;CADvance is also the only one of the reviewed programs that operates withinthe 640K-byte barrier of DOS.andP;  From one perspective, that's a weakness,because DOS extenders can make CAD programs run faster.andP;  However, fromanother perspective, CADvance can be used even on 286-based computers,provided they have a bit of spare LIM expanded memory.andM;In addition, CADvance runs reasonably fast on a 286 PC.andP;  -- E.Y.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
