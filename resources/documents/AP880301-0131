The nation's major opposition parties _ all 21 of them _ areboycotting Thursday's elections to Parliament, but there certainlyis no lack of election interest. As many as 102 political groupsare vying for the 330 seats.   Many, obviously, are quite small.   ``One has to use a microscope or a telescope to see if they arereally political parties,'' says Shamsul Huda Haryn, a politicalscience professor at Dhaka University.   Sorting out the groups in the parliamentary fray is difficultbecause one group on the ballot is known as ``the 23-partyalliance'' and another is listed as the ``combined oppositionparty,'' which is made up of 73 separate factions.   Whatever the number, the parliamentary contest illustrates justhow fractured the political system is in this nation of 105 millionpeople.   A government booklet on the country's ``multi-party politicalsystem '' notes that the ``polycentric political system inBangladesh has marked a phenomenal fragmentation of existingorganizations and growth of new ones.''   The booklet gives the history of 130 separate political parties.Some experts, however, believe there many be more than 200 separatepolitical groups.   Included in the political patchwork are 11 different Islamicparties, reflecting the predominant Moslem population, along withsix Communist parties, a Social Democratic Party, a SocialistParty, and two Republican parties.   There are even two separate United People's parties.   Harun, who studied in both England and the United States, saidBangladesh's political groups are not really parties as defined inthe West.   ``Call them pressure groups, or lobbies, or even sections,'' hesaid.   Harun said that many have no cohesive philosophy and were formedaround a single issue, tending to split or fall apart once theissue waned.   That politics is a passion here is evident in the grim toll itoften takes. At least eight people have died in the past two weeksof parliamentary campaigns. In local elections Feb. 10, more than100 were killed, according to government figures.   The election Thursday was prompted by a campaign by the 21opposition parties to topple President Hussain Muhammad Ershad.   After more than 20 general strikes called by the oppositionsince Nov. 10, which included 25 deaths in police clashes withmobs, Ershad dissolved Parliament in December and ordered a newelection. The opposition groups, however, have vowed to boycott it.   Those groups are the self-proclaimed ``eight-party alliance''led by Sheik Hasina of the Awami league, the ``seven-partyalliance'' headed by Khaleda Zia, a group known as the ``five-partyalliance,'' and the Jamaat-e-Islami, the largest Moslemfundamentalist party.   Diplomats and political observers say the Awami League is thebest organized. It was founded by Hasina's father, Sheik MujiburRahman, the country's first president who was assassinated in a1975 coup.   Ershad, 58, is a former general who took power in a coup andbecame president in 1986 in an election his opponents say wasrigged. They say Thursday's balloting also will be rife with fraud.   The Bengalis were noted for their passion for politics even inthe days when Britain was ruling the subcontinent. Bangladesh wasEast Bengal during British reign, then East Pakistan after thepartition of the subcontinent in 1947. It gained independence asBangladesh in 1971.   While theories abound on why politics here is so splintered,some say the Bengali people are by nature a divisive people.   As one oft-repeated saying goes: `Two Bengalis equal a politicalparty, three equal a party plus one faction.''</TEXT></DOC>
