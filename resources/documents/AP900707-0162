In 1928, tens of thousands of cheering, flag-waving Japanesejoined in the fun when rice was planted for the late EmperorHirohito's coronation. Drummers, traditional dancers, governmentdignitaries, even stunt planes participated in a rice-plantingfestival that lasted all day.   Times have changed.   This year, there will be no disclosure of the two ``sacred''paddies used to grow the rice Emperor Akihito will offer the godsafter his enthronement in November. The government says only thatthe rice is being grown in two states with countless rice paddies,Akita in the north and Oita in the west.   Masataka Otomo, a spokesman for the Akita state government,said: ``The final word on exactly whose paddy and where won't bemade public until after the rice is harvested.''   Even moving two thrones from western Japan to Tokyo in Maybecame a major tactical operation. Military helicopters and aconvoy of disguised police trucks were involved in transporting thedisassembled, crated thrones under cover of darkness.   Authorities say tight security is needed to guard againstattacks from the radical leftists.   ``Secrecy is not the wish of the government or the imperialfamily,'' said Nobuo Ishihara, deputy chief Cabinet secretary. ``Wewant to hold the ceremonies in the most open manner possible. Thereason is the attitude of the radicals.''   A spokesman for the ultraleft Chukaku-ha (Middle Core Faction)said: ``That's just an excuse for them to carry out theiroppression to protect that anti-people institution.''   He said in an interview, on condition of anonymity, that hisoften-violent group would ``continue the struggle to crush thecoronation.''   Radical leftists number in the thousands, but represent only atiny minority of Japanese, who generally either support or acceptthe imperial household.   During the mystical rice ritual, to be held after Akihito isformally enthroned Nov. 12, the emperor is believed to commune withthe sun goddess and other Shinto deities.   The Daijosai, or Great Food Offering Ritual, will take place intwo specially built halls on the Imperial Palace grounds in Tokyo,beginning late at night and lasting several hours.   Although it has been part of coronations for more than 1,000years, the Daijosai's religious nature has prompted intense debateof whether government plans to provide funds for it violate thepostwar constitution. The budget for the entire coronation is 8.11billion yen ($55.6 million).   More than 30,000 police are expected to protect the guestsexpected to attend the coronation, who include Prince Charles andPrincess Diana of Britain and President Fidel Castro of Cuba.   That number of police officers would be equal to about three offour in Tokyo and one of every 10 nationwide.   About the same number helped guard Hirohito's funeral inFebruary. President George Bush and representatives of more than160 other nations attended the funeral.   Once a precedent has been set for security arrangements, ``it isvery hard to propose a lower level,'' a police source said,speaking on condition of anonymity. ``If something goes wrong, youwill always be remembered as the one who let it happen.''   The visibility of police in the weeks before the funeral,coupled with spot checks of cars and ``interviews'' of residentsliving in strategic areas led to many complaints that human rightswere being violated.   Police vigilance did not, however, stop leftist radicals fromsetting fire to a shrine near the funeral site and planting a bombalong the funeral procession route. No one was injured by the bomb.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday AMs, July 16</NOTE></DOC>
