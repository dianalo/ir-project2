The fluorescence spectroscopic detection method was chosen becausemost PAH are efficient fluorophores and their fluorescence spectra havebeen well characterized. The application of this detection method tothe kinetic study of reactions of selected PAH with several gaseous pollutants,e.g., O/sub 3/, NO/sub 2/, and HNO/sub 3/, has been carried out in thislaboratory. Some results on reactions of gaseous O/sub 3/ with peryleneand BaP adsorbed on silica plates have been reported recently. This paperdescribes the methodology of sample preparation and PAH detection usingthe fluorescence spectroscopic technique. Results of a kinetic studyof reactions between pyrene and gaseous NO/sub 2/ in N/sub 2/ or O/sub2//N/sub 2/ diluent are presented and discussed in detail.</TEXT></DOC>
