Many of South Africa's poorest of the poor here areorganizing for what they believe will be a hard struggle fordemocracy. Sowetans don't credit the white government for thehistoric changes. They see the changes as victories in acontinuing struggle by blacks victimized by apartheid. Thehighly politicized shack-dwellers still regard Pretoria asthe enemy. &quot;I am waiting for the last kick of thegovernment,&quot; says Bob Gaga, a laborer here.   Recent events, however, demonstrate that the governmentstill has plenty of kick left. Mr. Mandela has postponedtalks with the Pretoria regime that were scheduled to beginnext Wednesday, after police in the black township ofSebokeng near Johannesburg last month killed about a dozendemonstrators and injured more than 400 people protestinghigh rents. President de Klerk this week sent more police andmilitary personnel to Natal Province to quell violence there.   This Soweto isn't the one outside Johannesburg that Mr.Mandela returned to after his release. Urban planners callthis place an &quot;informal settlement,&quot; even though it has asmany as 100,000 residents. It is characteristic of the blacktownships across South Africa.   To a reporter who was here for a month in 1986, justbefore the government declared a state of emergency thatfurther restricted the rights of blacks, the change isstriking. In 1986, anyone who spoke against the governmentwas subject to arrest. Residents were continually harassed bysoldiers, many in menacing vehicles called hippos that roamedthe dirt streets, sometimes knocking down dwellings. Therewas violence by blacks against blacks, as well. Peoplesuspected as informers for the government were &quot;necklaced&quot; --a tire drenched in gasoline was hung around their necks andset afire.   Because of their strong political organization, the PortElizabeth townships have escaped the factional fighting thatcontinues to plague the Natal province. &quot;The Port Elizabethblack community is a very close-knit community, with verystrong leadership,&quot; says Roger Matlock, regional director ofthe Urban Foundation, which made a recent study of thetownship.   Today, the people of this Soweto can call for toppling thegovernment with little fear of persecution, though detentionwithout trial still is permitted under the continuing stateof emergency. They chant &quot;Viva Mandela] Viva ANC]&quot; and theyare not arrested. The brave few who once defied authoritiesby wearing the black, green and gold colors of the ANC nowhave been joined by the many. T-shirts with Mr. Mandela'spicture on them are everywhere. Nearly everyone who spoke tothis reporter in 1986 requested anonymity; this time, no onedid.   Local violence has receded. And the hippos havedisappeared. Gladys Dumani says she no longer worries thather shanty will be crushed in the middle of the night. &quot;I'mfeeling much better,&quot; she says. &quot;I stayed in fear beforebecause, when I hear a hippo, I feared it would knock myhouse down whilst I am sleeping.&quot;   A few residents have even improved economically. Isaac&quot;Spider&quot; Gojela, a political organizer who was released fromjail a year ago, has moved with his wife to nearbyMotherwell, a new community designed in part to relievedangerous overcrowding here.   But upward mobility in these parts is measured in tinysteps. In Motherwell, Mr. Gojela, 35, lives in a cinder-blockhouse instead of a Soweto shanty. He moved up, he says, from&quot;a shack to a shed.&quot;   Soweto is horrendously poor, neglected and not even on thePort Elizabeth street map. Shoeless children in raggedclothes practice soccer with a tennis ball. Weary,beaten-down old men limp along the road, making way forgroups of youths with fire in their eyes. Hogs pick garbagefrom the muck near the open market. Dwellings have noplumbing. Streets aren't paved; there are no sewers and notelephones. Life expectancy is low. Whites outlive blacks onthe average by 15 years. And unemployment is high, about 60%.   Looking down the street at 9:30 at night, one sees noporch lights, no lights inside the shacks, no faint blue glowfrom a TV set. Indeed, there is no electricity. Tall pollsstand perhaps 200 yards apart from which lights onceilluminated broad areas. But they were put out years ago byyouths seeking to make night patrols by the police and armymore difficult.   The patrols for the most part are gone now, but theatmosphere is still tense; black goals remain unachieved.Sowetans have been encouraged by Mr. de Klerk's talk ofliberalization, but they are painfully aware that apartheidremains in place.   The people of Soweto, an ANC stronghold, are organizing topress for majority rule: a one-person, one-vote democracy ina unified state with unified cities and towns. &quot;We are in ahurry of seeing the new election of the people which wouldnot have the discrimination of the people,&quot; says BernstonMdyogolo, a 54-year-old fruit vendor in Soweto's square. &quot;Wewould like to see things change very fast.&quot;   To keep pressure on the South African government, manySowetans favor continuing economic sanctions by the U.S. andother countries. Sowetans believe the sanctions have playedan important role in bringing about the positive changes thathave taken place so far.   &quot;We are appealing to the Western countries to take the keyof sanctions and throw it to the sea as long as apartheid isstill existing in this country,&quot; says Wellington May, thenearly toothless chairman of Soweto's Area C community group.Mr. May, who once sold imported diesel parts, favorssanctions even if their effect has been to keep himunemployed for two years. &quot;It is not the point that it makesus to be unemployed. We want freedom. After that, sanctionscan be lifted.&quot;   Nobody expects white Afrikaners to give up power easily,however. Apartheid sought to eliminate black citizenship inSouth Africa by assigning blacks arbitrarily to citizenshipin tribal-based homelands, or Bantustans, without regard towhether they had ever lived there. Other blacks are forced tolive in certain &quot;townships&quot; or &quot;locations,&quot; which in essenceare labor camps for blacks with jobs in the nearby whitesections. Ibhayi is the government's name for Soweto andother townships around Port Elizabeth. Each township, as townclerk Flip Alberts concedes, is &quot;not a self-contained city.It's a dormitory town.&quot;   These sections have separate township councils that, likethe Bantustans, are integral parts of apartheid. The councilmembers, whose elections are boycotted by the the mass ofblacks, say they use the system to work for the aspirationsof fellow blacks. &quot;It is a fact we are in the apartheidgrid,&quot; says council member S.A. Mpondo. &quot;But we feel we haveto fight {from} within to get what we want.&quot;   Officials are still considered system stooges. But theirhomes no longer are burned, their lives no longer arethreatened by militants. Mr. Alberts, a hired cityadministrator, proudly says, &quot;Politically inspireddestructive activity is virtually nonexistent.&quot; But the cryin Soweto for &quot;one city, one municipality&quot; calls for theincorporation of the townships into Port Elizabeth.   The strongest support for international sanctions andother actions against apartheid is found among the neediest.The front room of Mr. May's house has a dirt floor. Fivechildren sleep in one room, three boys in a double bed, twogirls in a twin. With very little furniture, the place isbleak. Many Americans have garages that are more imposing. &quot;Iam trying to teach my children to live hygienically,&quot; saysMr. May, a priest in the African-Catholic Church. &quot;I amtrying not to let the apartheid oppress me. I'm trying topull myself up. I'm trying.&quot;   Living hygienically in Soweto is harder now than it wasfour years ago. It always was difficult. Without a properdrainage system, stagnant water collects in pools. The annualpopulation growth rate in Soweto, said to be in the range of6.9% to 8%, makes the place ever more crowded. The pigsrecently introduced to the community add to the filth.   Overcrowding extends from the shacks to the schools. At aprimary school called Mzisiswano, 77% of the children arefrom Soweto. Each class has at least 60 pupils. Attendance isvery good among children enrolled, but about 40% of Soweto'schildren don't ever go to school. Classrooms are ill-equippedand in need of repairs.   The most urgent local concern for shack-dwellers is decenthousing. Residents go to great lengths to maintain theirpride, while living in places unfit for human habitation:Some shanties have china cabinets with glasses, cups andsaucers neatly arrayed. People sweep the dry earth outsidetheir homes.   No matter how hard they work to make a shack a home, it isstill a shack. &quot;Enough is enough,&quot; says Thoko Nomkonwana, whocalls Soweto Shackville. &quot;We want houses. We want employment.Sooner not later.&quot;   A few hope to regain property they once owned. GertrudeMajola, a 61-year-old nurse, lives in one of the fewsubstantial buildings in Soweto. Her late husband, a teacher,bought the property in the late 1950s. But nearly 20 yearslater, the Bantu administration board made them relinquishtitle to their house, a store and sufficient land toaccommodate a hundred shacks. &quot;They said, `No, no, Africanscannot own land,'&quot; she recalls. &quot;So they made us sell it.&quot;   Since then, she has been a tenant on what had been herfamily's land. Mrs. Majola says the Ibhayi city council mightnow sell it back to her.   A new openness exists among South African blacks. BrianSokutu, the Port Elizabeth correspondent for the New Nation,was among many black journalists jailed without trial, evenwithout charges filed against them. His newspaper was shutdown temporarily. He recalls having to conceal liberationliterature, which he dared not keep at home. &quot;I would have togo at night and fetch it . . .,&quot; he says. &quot;But after theunbanning, now people can just put their literature on top oftheir desk and read it anywhere,&quot; he says. &quot;It's quiteexciting.&quot;   To try to achieve democracy, the Sowetans are rebuildingpolitical organizations that were struck down by the state ofemergency and by the arrests of many local leaders. Becausethe ANC was illegal, an umbrella black group called theUnited Democratic Front basically served as its above-groundoperation. But it was effectively outlawed, too, as wereaffiliated groups. Leaders went about in disguises and triedto evade the police. But nearly all of the black politicalleaders of Soweto by the Sea were captured and imprisonedwithout trial for as long as three years. And when they werereleased, restrictions amounting to house arrest made anyprotest a criminal act.   Because the street and area committees that had promotedpolitics and controlled crime were illegal, groups called&quot;anticrime committees&quot; were formed to deal with an upsurge inrobberies and violence. They succeeded in making the streetssafe. Now &quot;you can go day and night even if you are young orold,&quot; says Samuel Ngcume, who hobbles along the dirt roads oncrutches.   Reviving Soweto's political organization is time-consumingwork, what with all the meetings and rallies. Activists'enthusiasm got a big boost when Mr. Mandela held a huge rallynear Port Elizabeth last Sunday. Mr. Gojela, who organizes inboth Soweto and Motherwell and who was vice chairman of thearea committee before he went to jail for nearly three years,says it is important for leaders to rekindle the community'sfighting spirit. He is optimistic. &quot;It won't take long,&quot; hesays.   &quot;The signs are there that our liberation is coming, but atthis stage nobody can tell how far is it, which means unityand discipline are very much important,&quot; Mr. Gojela adds.&quot;Unity, in particular, because at any time we might seeourselves have a vote.&quot;   Liberation isn't imminent, however, longtime activistscaution. &quot;Sometimes I get worried&quot; {because} the expectationsare too high,&quot; says Raymond Mhlaba, who was one of the ANCofficials released after 26 years in prison, a few monthsbefore Mr. Mandela was freed. He is concerned about &quot;thebelief that we are on the verge of winning. That might not beso. It might take us five years.&quot;   For residents of this place, a better life can't come toosoon. &quot;I'm waiting for the pleasure of my life,&quot; says PapisiAlfred Wilson Kondile, who is in his 70s.   His hands shake, his beard is scraggly. He wears a red,white and gray knit hat and two brown sweaters over hisshirt. There are no laces in his shoes. A bucket catchesrainwater dripping into the small room from the sagging tinroof of his shack. He and his wife have little food. &quot;We livein a terrible situation,&quot; the old man says. &quot;Maybe things canget better. You see how much we suffer.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
