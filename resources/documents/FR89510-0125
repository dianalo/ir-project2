(``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'')filed with the Commission a proposed rule change under section 19(b) ofthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). The proposal provides fora new electronic trade resolution system, known as the ``Correction System,''to resolve NYSE's uncompared trades.\1\<NOTE/> Notice of the proposed rule change was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 15, 1989, to solicit comments from interestedpersons.\2\<NOTE/> No comments were received. This order approves the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Trade comparison, or the matching of the buy and sellsides of a securities transaction, is the process after a trade has beenexecuted by which broker-dealers confirm with each other the trade's terms(<T3>e.g., </T3>security, number of units, and price) and the existenceof a contract. Comparison is the first of the three major steps in processinga securities transaction (the other two being clearance and settlement).<T3>See </T3>Division of Market Regulation, <T3>The October 1987 Market Break, </T3>Ch. 10 at 2-4 (hereinafter <T3>Division Report</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26618 (March 9, 1989,54 FR 10766.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Description of the Proposal</ITAG> A. BackgroundA new NYSE rule previously approved by the Commission,\3\<NOTE/> mandates the use of an automated system called the OvernightComparison System (``OCS''), which is being developed jointly by the NYSEand the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'').\4\<NOTE/> OCS mainly will consist of two automated sub-systems; (1)NYSE's Correction System, and (2) NSCC's Comparison Redesign System. Thisorder concerns the approval and implementation of the NYSE's CorrectionSystem.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26627 (March 14, 1989),54 FR 11470 [File No. SR-NYSE-88-36], approving NYSE Rule 130.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ For an operational description of OCS, <T3>see </T3>NYSE Membership Bulletins (May 27, 1988 and July 15, 1988),and NYSE Membership Notice (August 19, 1988). These documents are reprintedas Exhibit 2 of File No. SR-NYSE-88-36, at pages 1, 6, and 54, respectively.The NYSE has indicated that it plans to make OCS fully effective by September1991.\5\<NOTE/> The plans call for OCS to be implemented in stages. Eachof the two major sub-systems will be the subject of one or more independentrule filings dealing with their design, operations, fees, and implementation.The Correction System (which itself will be implemented in stages) willbe implemented first, with the Comparison Redesign System to follow. Asdiscussed in detail below, the Correction System will computerize the NYSE'sprocessing of uncompared trades, <T3>i.e., </T3>it will permit the automated pairing of trade sides thathave not been properly matched.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The NYSE stated in its filing proposing NYSE Rule 130that it plans to have OCS fully operational within 18 months of the Commission'sapproval of Rule 130. <T3>See </T3>File No. SR-NYSE-88-36, Form 19b-4 at 3; Notice of ProposedRule Change, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26342 (December 6, 1988),53 FR 49949. The Commission approved Rule 130 on March 14, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The NSCC has filed with the Commission under Section 19(b)(2)of the Act its own OCS rule proposal for the Redesign System dealing withT+1 comparison of transactions executed on the NYSE. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26742 (April 18, 1989);54 FR 18063 [File No. SR-NSCC-89-04].The second major sub-system, the NSC's Comparison Redesign System, willpermit all transactions to be compared or closed out by the close of businesson the business day following the trade date (<T3>i.e., </T3>``T+1''), as required by new NYSE Rule 130.\7\<NOTE/> Under previous NYSE rules, transactions were required tobe compared or otherwise closed out by T+5.\8\<NOTE/> Thus, the Redesign System, when fully implemented, is expectedto shorten a transaction's comparison cycle by four business days. Theproposal, however, would not effect the settlement of transactions, themajority of which would continue to settle on T+5.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ NYSE Rule 130 and its sub-systems would apply only tocontracts for ``regular way'' (<T3>i.e., </T3>T+5) settlement in stocks, rights, and warrants, as providedin NYSE Rules 64(2), 131, 132, and 133. They would not apply to contractsthat: (1) are designated for cash settlement, next-day settlement, or seller'soption settlement; or (2) involve other securities such as bonds or options.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>See </T3>NYSE Rule 134.A(f). Currently, NYSE trades typically are comparedon or after the morning of T+2, and an NYSE trade that remains uncomparedafter 2:00 p.m. on T+2 is known as a ``questioned trade,'' or a ``QT.''<T3>See </T3>NYSE Rule 134.A(c); <T3>Division Report, </T3>Ch. 10 at 3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Settlement, the final step in securities processing (followingcomparison and clearance), is the process of exchanging money for securities(<T3>i.e., </T3>delivery and payment) that consummates a transaction. <T3>See Division Report, </T3>Ch. 10 at 2, 5.B. <T3>NYSE's Proposed Correction System</T3>The proposed Correction System consists of a new set of automated proceduresthat would provide for the resolution of NYSE's uncompared trades (knownat the Exchange as ``questioned trades,'' or ``QTs'') \1\\0\<NOTE/> Currently, QTs are resolved by manual operations pursuantto the procedures of NYSE Rule 134.A. The new procedures contemplate anelectronic trade resolution system with user operated cathode-ray tubeterminals and an on-line data base that would replace the current paperhandling.\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ <T3>See </T3>``Correction System Procedures,'' at Exhibit A, page 2, ofthe instant filing.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ The NYSE states that the new procedures are being adoptedas a rule and that eventually the procedures will be printed in the NYSErulebook as text superseding the existing text of NYSE Rule 134.A. Thenew procedures are not being added as text to the NYSE rulebook at thistime because, initially, as the new procedures are phased in, they willapply only to transactions in securities beginning with the letter ``A''(and gradually to other letters), with all other transactions being governedby the procedures of existing Rule 134.A. Thus, until the phase-in processis completed, a dichotomy of rules will exist on the procedures governinguncompared trades. Telephone conversation between Stanley Jacoby, TradeComparison Specialist, NYSE, and Thomas C. Etter, Attorney, SEC (April13, 1989).The Correction System's terminal screens would display relevant trade dataon the uncompared trades and would permit direct entry (by typewriter keyboard)into computer terminals that could send and receive on-line inquiries.The System also would have the flexibility to operate within existing comparisontime frames or within a more compressed comparison cycle.Operationally, the Correction System would work as follows: Terminals wouldbe installed in the operations areas of clearing firms, specialist firms,and in NYSE's QT area.\1\\2\<NOTE/> During the evening of T+1, the NSCC would send all uncomparedtrade data to the NYSE, and the NYSE would make the data available to participantson the morning of T+2, concurrent with NSCC regular-way contracts.\1\\3\<NOTE/> All firms would be required to stamp ``advisories'' and add,through the System, additional sides for advisories that are participantsecurities.\1\\4\<NOTE/> At the close of business on T+2, NYSE would send all compareditems to NSCC; and on the morning of T+3, these compared items would appearon the NSCC Supplemental Contract Sheet.\1\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ The NYSE's QT Center is located at 11 Wall Street.<ITAG tagnum="28">The NYSE recommends in its filing that those firms ordinarily havinga substantial number of trade adjustments should install terminals in theiroperational areas. NYSE further notes, however, that smaller firms or otherfirms without a substantial number of adjustments would be able to processtheir adjustments by using common terminals and printers in the NYSE'sPost Trade Processing Center, also located at 11 Wall Street.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ On T+2, the NSCC currently issues clearing member reports(known as ``contract sheets'') that list: (1) Compared trades, (2) uncomparedtrades, and (3) advisory trades. Uncompared trades are trades submittedby a member that have not been matched; and advisory trades are tradessubmitted by the contraside, against the member, that have not been matched.<T3>See Division Report,</T3> Ch. 10 at 3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ The NSCC has informed the Commission that, as partof its joint OCS project with the NYSE, it would no longer accept non-Systemadjustments on securities after the securities have been integrated intoNYSE's Correction System as participant securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ As stated above, the NSCC is developing a ComparisonRedesign System, <T3>i.e.,</T3> a new trade comparison system, to assist the NYSE in itsefforts to complete trade comparison by T+1. Under the new NSCC system,the NYSE would continue to send its systemized locked-in (automaticallycompared) trades to NSCC on the evening of the trade date. This processwould remain unchanged.<ITAG tagnum="28">The NSCC's match routine would remain unchanged except for one modification,</ITAG><T3>i.e.,</T3> the addition of a new match element with audit trail data.The remaining four elements of the existing match routine (exact match,summarization, suggested name, and partial suggested name for omnibus accounts)would remain the same. On T+1, the NSCC would require its participantsto submit their remaining non-systemized (``crowd side'') input to NSCCno later than 2:00 a.m. New York time. After all participant data havebeen received, the NSCC would begin its initial match routine for thesetrades.<ITAG tagnum="28">The trade resolution process would begin after participants receivethe results of the NSCC's initial match. The NSCC plans to allow participantsto submit the following adjustments until noon on T+1: (1) Deletion ofan uncompared trade, (2) deletion of a compared suggested name, (3) acknowledgementof an advisory, and (4) as-ofs. At approximately noon on T+1, the NSCCwould process all adjustments through an exact match, with the resultsto be available in a Preliminary Adjustment Listing at approximately 1:00p.m. As the Preliminary Adjustment Listing is being distributed to theNYSE member organizations, NSCC will generate an uncompared file of QTsfor any transations not yet resolved through the NYSE's Correction Systemor NSCC's adjustment process.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Participants then would resolve any open items through the NYSE'sCorrection System. The NYSE would submit its QTs to the NSCC by 5:00 p.m.for subsequent settlement. The NSCC would generate a Final Adjustment Contractdisplaying the compared QTs at approximately 8:00 p.m. For further descriptionof the NSCC's Comparison Redesign Systems, </ITAG><T3>see</T3> NSCC's Important Notice A3049 (August 19, 1988), reprintedas Exhibit 2, page 63, of File No. SR-NYSE-88-36.Clearing firms would ensure that all uncompared trades remaining on theirfile by the end of T+2 are valid QTs, which would be submitted to theirQT clerks on the morning of T+3. These QTs would remain in the ``OCS file.''Additionally, on the morning of T+3, uncompared items would be displayedon the QT terminals for resolution. On normal volume days, QT terminalsand advisory screens would be available from about 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.All submitting clearing firms would have access to the data, but contrafirms would only have the ability to accept or ``DK'' (indicating they``don't know'') the items.\1\\6\<NOTE/> QTs that are resolved through the appropriate key strokeson the terminals would be sent automatically to NSCC for processing.\1\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ The NYSE states that this provision eliminates thepossibility of the comparison of erroneous trades or of having the tradeterms changed by a contra party. <T3>See</T3> NYSE Rule 134.A(e), for the Exchange's current treatment of``DKs.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ The NYSE states that as a consequence of this procedureno multi-part QT forms will be delivered to Securities Industry AutomationCorporation for keypunching.All NYSE member organizations having uncompared trades in securities thatare not yet eligible for OCS processing would continue to resolve thesetrades under existing QT rules (<T3>i.e.,</T3> NYSE Rule 134.A).\1\\8\<NOTE/> Nevertheless, the NYSE states that as experience is gainedwith the new System, additional securities would be added until all NYSEsecurities are eligible, and eventually the existing QT rules would besuperseded with new rules.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\<T3>See, </T3>generally, NYSE Rule 134.A for the Exchange's existing rulesgoverning ``QTs.''C. Implementation Schedule for the Correction SystemDuring late March 1989, the NYSE loaded clearing members' accounts intothe Correction System. Also, the NYSE has loaded all NYSE securities beginningwith the letter ``A.'' The plans call for NYSE member organizations topractice with the system for a three week period, with the third week toinvolve live trades. Gradually, from April through June more letters willbe added until all letters (A through Z) have been loaded into the system.When fully operational, the Correction System would be able to handle 50,000to 60,000 QTs per day.\1\\9\<NOTE/> Two screens would be available: (1) A clearing firm's screenthat would display all its trade data, and (2) a specialist's screen thatwould display all data on the specialist's securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ The NYSE's QTs on T+2 averaged 8,000 per day in theFall of 1987, and on October 19, 1987, during the Market Break, they peakedat 56,626. <T3>See Division Report,</T3> Table 1, Ch. 10, p. 59.After the Correction System is fully operational, the NSCC plans to implementits Comparison Redesign System, perhaps toward the end of June 1989. TheNSCC plans to have the Redesign running (in practice form) in May 1989and to have a shake-out phase in early June 1989. The NSCC hopes to implementthe Redesign in June with all letters (A through Z) operational. Nevertheless,the NSCC has emphasized that Redesign's implementation will depend on theCorrection System's being operational first. As stated above, this orderconcerns only the approval and implementation of the Correction System.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Rationale for the Proposal</ITAG>The NYSE states in its filing that the automated Correction System wouldimprove the ability of its member organizations to resolve their uncomparedtrades and, more generally, would enhance the efficiency of the marketplace.The Exchange notes that the new procedures would be: (1) Time-effectivein that the automated system would permit speedier resolution of uncomparedtrades, and (2) cost-effective in that the automation would eliminate labor-intensiveoperations involved in the current procedures of manually correcting anddistributing hard copy QT forms.The NYSE further states that, as required in section 6(b)(5) of the Act,the Correction System and OCS, of which the Correction System is a part,would foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating,clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitatingtransactions in securities. The NYSE also states that the proposal accordswith the requirements of Section 17A(a)(1) of the Act in that it wouldenhance the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securitiestransactions.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>This order applies only to the NYSE's proposed Correction System. The CorrectionSystem, which would use automated procedures to match uncompared trades,is a major part of a larger system, the OCS, which NYSE and NSCC are developingjointly to improve the processing of securities transactions.The Commission notes that section 17A(a)(1) of the Act expressly contemplatesthe goal of prompt and efficient clearance and settlement of securitiestransactions (including the comparison of securities transactions) andthe use of automated systems in pursuit of this goal. Congress stated inthat provision that inefficient procedures for the clearance and settlementof securities transactions impose unnecessary risks and costs on investorsand that prompt and accurate clearance and settlement are necessary forinvestor protection. Congress further stated in sections 6(b)(5), 15A(b)(8),and 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act that the rules of securities exchanges, securitiesassociations, and clearing agencies, respectively, should be designed topromote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securitiestransactions.The Commission believes that the Correction System is consistent with theAct, particularly sections 6(b) and 17A of the Act. The Correction System,an automated trade resolution system, would replace the Exchange's lessefficient manual procedures. As a result, the System would reduce significantlythe time and expense needed to correct uncompared trades. Accordingly,the Commission believes the proposed Correction System would contributeto the prompt and efficient clearance and settlement of securities transactionsand warrants approval.This proposal, moreover, is not a matter of first impression for the Commission.The NASDAQ, Inc., with Commission approval, has been using its Trade Acceptanceand Resolution System (``TARS'') since 1986. TARS, like the NYSE's proposedCorrection System, is an automated facility that permits subscribers, usingterminal screens, to resolve uncompared trades.\20\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ TARS was designed to assist its subscribers in resolvingand reducing their uncompared and advisory over-the-counter (``OTC'') tradesthat were being processed through participating clearing corporations.TARS permits subscribers to view on their terminal screens all the informationcontained on their daily OTC contract sheets received from their clearingcorporations and to take actions to resolve the outstanding items. <T3>See</T3> NASD Market Services, Inc., <T3>Trade Acceptance and Reconciliation Service User Guide </T3>(May 20,1986).<ITAG tagnum="28">The </ITAG><T3>Brady Report</T3> noted that OTC QTs could be resolved by utilizingTARS, whereas listed QTs that could not be reconcilied by the buyer andseller required a return to the trading floor for resolution. <T3>See Report of the Presidential Task Force of Market Mechanisms,</T3>Study VI at 16 (December 1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons discussed in this order, the Commission finds that theproposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulationsthereunder.<T3>It is therefore ordered,</T3> Pursuant to section 19(b) of the Actthat the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR-NYSE-89-03)be, and hereby is, approved.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
