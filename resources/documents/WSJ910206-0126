Nowadays, Churchill's incomparable breadth of experience,amazing appetite for life and moral sanity seem ever moreappealing; he was, of course, his own best chronicler and oneof the century's best writers. Writing about Churchill hasthus a high standard to come up to -- one reflected in MartinGilbert's official and William Manchester's popularbiographies.</LP><TEXT>   Two current Churchill books variously disappoint. &quot;TheDuel: 10 May-31 July 1940: The Eighty-Day Struggle BetweenChurchill and Hitler&quot; (Ticknor andamp; Fields, 224 pages, $19.95)is by the distinguished historian John Lukacs, whose &quot;LastEuropean War&quot; offered a fresh perspective on the limitednature of the war's early days. This time Mr. Lukacs attemptsa miniaturized version of his earlier thesis by constructinga detailed parallel between the two leaders' activities inthe title's 80 days. On May 10, Hitler invaded France andChurchill became prime minister. As the two men gloweredacross the Channel they provide a contrast for Mr. Lukacs.   Hitler's personality &quot;was cold, Churchill's was warm.&quot;Hitler never cried; Churchill bawled shamelessly. ThoughHitler's mother loved him, his childhood was unhappy. ThoughChurchill's mother neglected him, he had a sunny childhood.Both guys were &quot;undersexed,&quot; but while Hitler would &quot;let noneof his servants ever see him in his underpants,&quot; Winston hadno such inhibition. Hitler liked &quot;sweet creamy cakes&quot;;Winston liked everything good to eat and drink and smoke.This obsessive paralleling smacks more of People than ofPlutarch, and the book never quite recovers from this initialtriviality.   In mid-July occurred two key complementary speeches. OnJuly 14, Churchill gave his &quot;finest hour&quot; masterpiece,invoking &quot;human progress&quot; and &quot;Christian civilization&quot; andvowing eternal resistance. On July 19, Hitler delivered afinal &quot;appeal of reason to England&quot; before the Reichstag,calling Churchill &quot;a blood-covered dilettante&quot; in the hire of&quot;blood-stained Jewish-capitalist warmongers.&quot; Mr. Lukacsrises eloquently to this contrast &quot;between Good and Evil.&quot;   All the while, a deeper and more determining current wasrunning beneath the surface. Hitler was reaching the decisionto invade Russia; in Washington FDR was deciding to committhe U.S. to the British side. These were the twoworld-strategic hinges of the war. Both decisions Mr. Lukacspinpoints to July 31: &quot;At the cool and cloudy Berghof Hitlerdeclared his decision . . . on a muggy summer day in theWhite House Roosevelt made his decision.&quot;   As obsessed as an astrologer with meteorological and evennumerological parallels, Mr. Lukacs is soon off on anotherbinge of comparison: &quot;Roosevelt and Hitler were of coursevery different men. Both were secretive, but in differentways.&quot; This book is, in short, from the bottom drawer of agifted writer and scholar; it shoehorns many intriguing andoriginal historical insights into a lurid melodrama ofcontrasting styles in underwear.   Richard Hough's &quot;Winston and Clementine: The Triumphs andTragedies of the Churchills&quot; (Bantam, 528 pages, $24.95),though nonfictional in form, amounts to a Harlequin romancestarring the famous couple. We open on a damp March eveningin 1908. &quot;Beautiful, distinguished twenty-three-year-old&quot;Clementine Hozier comes home &quot;tired and hungry&quot; from a hardday giving French lessons. Mama tells her she must go to heraunt Mary's for dinner lest she be forced to seat 13. &quot;Mama,I'm so tired . . . I've no gown ready and no clean gloves,&quot;protests Clementine. But go she obediently does, and guesswho sits right next to her.   &quot;In a very short time she is enchanted by his attention,admiring of the agility of his mind, laughing at his jokesand anecdotes, warmed by his personality . . . She has metmany up-and-coming young men, but none who sparkles moredazzlingly . . .&quot;   And how did the young man feel? &quot;For several years now,Winston had become increasingly aware that there was ahollowness in his life that ached to be filled . . . He waslike a passenger in an express train racing through, say, thePo Valley, with scarcely time to glance out through thewindow to admire the scenery.&quot; Clementine, it seems, is anifty bend in the Po. By now one is reading for laughs alone.   Soon they wed. Clementine schemes ruthlessly for her younghusband's career, loathing chic Margot Asquith, wife of theprime minister -- especially her &quot;calf-length evening gown,of purple silk and wool crepe with a gauged skirt,&quot; which shecoldly noticed while &quot;the butler took round the Pol Rogerchampagne&quot; at a dinner.   Motherhood brings an awkwardness to Clementine: &quot;She hadbecome increasingly aware that she did not seem able to feelor show the same affection for her children as other mothersdid . . .&quot; Never mind. Winston had a problem, too, in hisaging mom: &quot;Love was in the air again for Winston's mother,too.&quot; But he blithely copes. He always adored his mother.</TEXT></DOC>
