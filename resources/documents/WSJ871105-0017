At the start of Asian trading, the dollar fell to 1.6925 marks, well below the record of 1.7001 marks set during intraday trading just two days ago. By 12:30 p.m. Thursday, Tokyo time (10:30 p.m. EST Wednesday), it stood at 1.6905 marks. At the same time, the U.S. currency stood at 135.70 yen, under the previous low of 136.06 yen, also set on Tuesday.    &quot;Before Tokyo opened, there was a crush of selling {by traders} trying to push the dollar below the 1.70-mark level to trigger stop-loss orders,&quot; said Shane McSpeerin, chief trader for Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney, Australia, where trading begins earlier than in Tokyo. Those orders are left with banks to automatically sell or buy currencies at specific prices to limit losses or lock in profits,. &quot;For about a half hour, {the dollar&quot;} held at the 1.70 level, but at the first sign of weakness, there it went,&quot; Mr. McSpeerin said.    Masao Tsuji, chief trader for Bank of Tokyo in Tokyo, said the assault on the dollar represented an attempt by traders and speculators to test what many in the market believe are new, lower trading ranges established by the major central banks.    In February, the seven largest industrialized democracies agreed to try to stabilize the dollar with the so-called Louvre accord. That agreement set trading ranges for the dollar against the mark and yen that have never been officially revealed. Those ranges have been lowered recently, many traders and economists believe.    &quot;Three times traders from the U.S. tried to break the {1.70-mark level}, and they finally succeeded,&quot; said Mr. Tsuji. Adding that sentiment on the dollar was very bearish, he said that the traders' target was 1.65 marks and 132 yen.    Traders in Tokyo estimated that the Bank of Japan had purchased as much as $500 million in the first hour of trading there in an effort to keep the currency from falling further against the yen. &quot;The feeling is the Bank of Japan is more determined than the Bundesbank,&quot; which is the German central bank, to keep the dollar from falling too far, said the chief trader at a major Japanese bank in Tokyo.    Whatever the Japanese central bank's intentions are, a consensus is growing that its U.S. and West German counterparts are more willing to tolerate the dollar's slow decline.    As Asian trading began Thursday, that sentiment appeared to be influencing the dollar more than speculation that the Bundesbank may lower German interest rates. Such interest-rate speculation had helped slow the dollar's decline in Wednesday trading. In late New York trading Wednesday, the dollar stood at 1.7040 marks, down from 1.7165 marks Tuesday, and 136.70 yen, down from 137.51 yen.    European and U.S. traders were divided over whether the Bundesbank would cut any of its important interest rates, including the 3% discount rate, to help slow the dollar's slide. In the credit markets, meanwhile, there was speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may lower interest rates soon, in conjunction with the Bundesbank.    Speculation concerning a German rate cut was heightened by reports that West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg will participate in today's regularly scheduled meeting of the Bundesbank's decision-making central bank council. Last week, he advocated relaxing German monetary policy. Some analysts also have noted that the Netherlands cut its discount rate on Tuesday and that the British central bank lowered its money-market dealing rate Wednesday, prompting major British banks to cut their base lending rates by half a percentage point, to 9%.    But analysts said the Bundesbank itself is split on the question of lower interest rates. Noting that until Oct. 20, the central bank had been letting rates rise, a source close to the Bundesbank cautioned: &quot;Don't expect the bank to completely reverse policy in 14 days.&quot;    If they succeeded in buoying the dollar, lower German interest rates also would alleviate tensions within the European Monetary System, which is a joint float of eight continental European currencies. The French, Belgian, Danish and Italian currencies have fallen against the mark as the German currency has risen against the dollar, raising speculation about a possible EMS realignment.    Dealers remain very bearish on the dollar and are growing increasingly frustrated about the lack of positive news emerging from negotiations between the Reagan administration and Congress to reduce the budget deficit. They described yesterday's trading as choppy and nervous.    Even though the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law mandates a $23 billion cut in the federal budget deficit for the year that began Oct. 1, &quot;If that's what the market gets, it will be very disappointed,&quot; said Roberto Bianchi, a vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich. &quot;The market's looking for $50 billion to $60 billion.&quot;    Carmine J. Rotondo, chief corporate dealer at Security Pacific International Bank in New York, said: &quot;The only thing that will save this market is a rescue package from the U.S. Anything less than that and the dollar will still go south.&quot;    In Asian trading Wednesday, the Bank of Japan was reported to have bought an estimated $500 million to keep the yen from rising. In Tokyo, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan had no choice but to continue intervening in the currency markets until the U.S. acts on its budget deficit. And at the Frankfurt fixing Wednesday, the Bundesbank purchased $100.6 million. But traders said the central bank didn't intervene after that, nor did they notice activity by other Western central banks.    Meanwhile, Mr. Stoltenberg warned that a further decline in the dollar would &quot;hurt the vital economic interests not just of West Germany and Japan, but also of the U.S.&quot; In an interview to appear in today's edition of Die Welt, a German newspaper, he also said that Washington &quot;clearly&quot; wanted a stable dollar.    The comments briefly boosted the dollar, &quot;but once people {digested} what was said, they decided to attack the dollar again,&quot; said Keith R. Baker, manager of foreign exchange for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in London.    Currency dealers &quot;have been making money over the last few weeks selling dollars,&quot; said Mr. Rotondo. &quot;They're not going to change on jawboning. They want to see something tangible come out&quot; of the Washington budget meetings.
