<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-47-0037 </DOCNO><TEXT>A theory of the generalized magnetic monopole without string, which isdistinct from Dirac's original theory and also distinct from the topologicaltheory of the monopole is presented. This theory is first formulatedin the Clifford bundle formalism; and in the particular case of electrodynamicsit is deduced from Maxwell equations the generalized Lorentz force andthe equations of motion of charges and monopoles. The conservation lawsand the problem of Lagrangian formalism are discussed. Dirac quantizationcondition in two different ways are obtained. Finally a principal fiberformulation of the theory using the spliced bundle concept with gaugegroup GxG, where G is the gauge group of the theory without monopoles,is presented. 21 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
