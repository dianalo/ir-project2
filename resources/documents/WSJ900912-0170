The embattled Kansas Gandamp;E disclosed the talks in a filingwith the Securities and Exchange Commission and also said itwould provide certain &quot;non-public information&quot; about itselfto Kansas City Pandamp;L, giving that company a chance to reviseits $27-a-share offer.

Drue Jennings,Kansas Gandamp;E Chairman Wilson K. Cadman offered the same&quot;information . . . provided by KGandamp;E to other third partieswho have expressed an interest in exploring certaincombinations with KGandamp;E or a purchase of KGandamp;E assets,&quot; subjectto confidentiality agreements. Mr. Cadman also informed Mr.Jennings of the negotiations with the unidentified companyand added that, &quot;moreover, the company may also enter intonegotiations with one or more other parties.&quot;   A spokesman for Kansas Gandamp;E wouldn't go beyond a companystatement about the filing.   A spokesman for Kansas City Power andamp; Light said last night,&quot;It's an interesting development and we're anxious to talk tothem ourselves. We look forward to seeing the sameinformation that's being supplied to other parties.&quot;   Kansas Gandamp;E has spurned the Kansas City Pandamp;L offer, callingit inadequate and overly conditional and saying that it&quot;raises substantial and serious legal questions and numerousuncertainties under state and federal statutes.&quot;   But the $27-a-share offer still tops Kansas Gandamp;E's recentstock price.
