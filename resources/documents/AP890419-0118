In a broad assessment of American energy prospects, the UnitedStates Energy Association said the special agency could enhance thenation's energy security by eliminating what it calledunnecessarily long lead times for major projects.   It said the agency could be fashioned along the lines of theenergy mobilization board proposed by then-President Carter as partof a 1979 energy program. The board was never created.   Jack Bowen, first vice chairman of the energy association, saidin presenting the proposal to the group's annual meeting that amobilization board would enable project developers to sidestepunnecessary legal and regulatory obstacles.   ``What it means is that no one can kill you with regulatorydelays,'' he said. ``It goes up or down on its merits. The lawyersmay not like it, but it's something we've got to do.''   Bowen's group is comprised of about 100 private and publicenergy-related organizations whose members represent virtuallyevery segment of the energy industry.   Among the group's other recommendations:   _Develop an integrated national energy strategy.   _Increase energy conservation, encourage greater energyefficiency and expand the use of renewable energy sources.   _Increase domestic oil and natural gas production and increasethe use of natural gas and coal as a means of reducing the nation'sreliance on foreign oil.   _Encourage the construction of nuclear power plants.   Henson Moore, the Energy Department's deputy secretary, said ina speech to the association that the department was moving tofashion a comprehensive energy strategy but that it might not beready by the target date of April 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
