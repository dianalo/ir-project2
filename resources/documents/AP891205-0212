Danny Wall as thenation's top savings and loan regulator but that the post would notbe filled until January.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater commented a day afterWall announced in a letter to President Bush that he was quitting ajob he said amounted to a ``thankless and perhaps impossibletask.'' He said he was leaving to spare his Office of ThriftSupervision the disruption that would be caused by continuing hisfight for political survival with Congress.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administrationwas conferring on the vacancy with Treasury Secretary NicholasBrady, to whom Wall reported; Michael Boskin, the chairman of theCouncil of Economic Advisers; and members of Congress.   Since Congress is in recess, ``it will be January before a newdirector is in place,'' Fitzwater said.   Wall set no date for his departure, saying he would stay on fora transition period. He said he was looking forward to a job out ofgovernment but had no specific position in mind.   Early speculation on Wall's successor centered on threeexperienced regulators. According to an industry source they are:   _Richard F. Syron, president of the Federal Reserve Bank ofBoston and a former president of the Federal Home Loan Bank ofBoston.   _William H. Roelle, a long-time official of the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. in charge of Sandamp;L rescue deals at the ResolutionTrust Corp.   _William Taylor, a senior regulatory official at the FederalReserve Board serving as an adviser to the administration boardthat oversees the RTC.   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said althoughall three men were well regarded by Treasury Department officialswho oversee Wall's agency, other candidates also could surface.   Until Thanksgiving, the House Banking Committee was holdingweekly hearings spotlighting Wall's failure to contain what couldbecome the nation's largest Sandamp;L failure. The regulator was spendingmuch of his time responding to his critics.   Most recently, Wall has come under fire for his handling ofLincoln Savings and Loan Association, an Irvine, Calif., thriftwhose failure is expected to cost taxpayers up to $2.5 billion.   House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, thefirst to call for Wall's ouster, faulted the regulator forrejecting a May 1987 recommendation from federal examiners in SanFrancisco that Lincoln be seized.   Wall said examiners had not produced the evidence needed tolegally justify the seizure, which occurred in April. At a packednews conference, Wall said if he had it to do over again he mighthave ordered the seizure and let the courts take the blame forblocking it.   ``It may indeed have been a no-win situation,'' he said.   Even before Gonzalez began probing the Lincoln case, Wallendured grueling congressional criticism for what proved to begrossly low estimates of the size of the Sandamp;L crisis and for a rashof Sandamp;L bailout deals in December 1988 driven by expiring taxbenefits.   However, he is generally given credit for raising morale at hisagency and rebuilding its depleted ranks of examiners.   Wall was ``wrong, but not corrupt,'' according to Rep. JimLeach, R-Iowa, a member of the banking panel.   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., also a member of the committee, saidWall ``put politics first and good public policy second'' and used``excessively bad judgment.''   Gonzalez called for Wall's resignation in a letter to Bush inOctober. In recent weeks the committee chairman was joined bySenate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, threetaxpayer-advocacy groups and several major newspapers.   Neither Brady nor Bush defended Wall in public and, according togovernment sources, White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray was pushingfor his ouster.   Wall, however, said ``this has been completely at myinitiative'' and passed up several opportunities to criticize theadministration for lack of support. He said no one at the WhiteHouse asked him to leave.   The regulator said he had offered to leave office last January,but the administration, which then was drafting proposed Sandamp;Lbailout legislation, wanted him to serve out his term through June30, 1991.   Wall reserved his most bitter remarks for Gonzalez, accusing thecommittee chairman of orchestrating ``simplistic efforts to find ascapegoat to shoulder the blame for the entire thrift crisis.'' Hesaid Gonzalez resorted to ``corruption of the truth and abandonmentof our historical devotion to fair play.''   Gonzalez's committee heard from Wall for 10 hours in lateNovember but only after the committee had already conducted fiveall-day sessions to hear from the agency's critics. The regulatorattacked what he called the ``deliberately lopsided presentation''during the hearings.</TEXT></DOC>
