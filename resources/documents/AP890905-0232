Analysts said the PCs, including one using International BusinessMachine Corp.'s Micro Channel architecture, were priced to competewith IBM, Compaq Computer Inc. and other manufacturers of integratedoffice systems for large corporate customers.   ``This should allow Wang to move out inventory and turn it intocash to reduce debt, which is the first thing they've got to do _get their balance sheet cleaned up,'' said Fred Pastore, a hightechnology analyst at Moody's Investors Service in New York.   Wang reported a $424 million loss for the fiscal year that endedJune 30 and has announced plans to eliminate 2,200 of its 30,000employees by the end of this month. It recently reshuffled its topmanagement, naming Richard Miller to succeed Frederick A. Wang, sonof founder and chairman An Wang, as president.   The Lowell-based company was a leader in word processingequipment in the 1970s but was criticized in the early 1980s forsticking with its proprietary systems instead of moving quickly intoIBM-compatible machines. In recent years, its sales of minicomputershave been hurt by competition from more and more powerful PCs andworkstations.   Pastore said the introduction of the new PCs was intended torestore customer confidence by signaling Wang's commitment to``follow established standards rather than trying to go its ownroute and do its own thing.''   But because of its financial position, he added, the best thecompany can realistically hope for is to retain its existingcustomers. ``We don't expect them to get much new business,''Pastore said.   Wang's worldwide marketing manager, Daniel H. Miley, disagreed.He said the company believes the machines will attract new customersby providing ``higher performance, greater capability, at a betterprice'' than their competitors and offering ``a long-term ability torun off-the-shelf, industry-standard software.''   ``There's a move in the industry toward open standards, and weare clearly supporting that move with this announcement,'' Mileyadded.   The new machines, manufactured in Lowell, Taiwan and Limerick,Ireland, include the model PC 350-16S, a desktop based on the 386 SXmicroprocessor from Intel Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif. It carries alist price of $2,695, about $600 less than a comparable model fromHouston-based Compaq, the leading maker of IBM compatibles.   Wang also introduced the model MC 350@16S, combining a 386 SXchip with Micro Channel architecture, at $2,995. Micro Channel,which Wang has licensed from IBM, speeds the transfer of databetween the computer's memory and central processor.   Wang also unveiled two PCs based on popular 80286 chips, the PC250-16 at $2,095 and the PC 280-20 at $2,995. The later can be usedas an inexpensive local area network server, linking multiplemachines.</TEXT></DOC>
