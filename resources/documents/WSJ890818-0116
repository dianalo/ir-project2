In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Cineplex said a departure by Mr. Drabinsky or Mr. Gottlieb would result in &quot;the equivalent of an act of default&quot; under an agreement with one of the company's bankers.    The principal amount owing on that loan is $39 million, but Cineplex said such a default &quot;could result in the acceleration of all bank loans presently included in long-term indebtedness&quot; as a result of cross default clauses in other banking agreements.    Cineplex also disclosed other clauses in recent agreements that would be triggered if Messrs. Drabinsky and Gottlieb &quot;cease to be officers and directors of the corporation.&quot; The company said it could be required to repurchase 57 theater properties sold to Carena Developments Ltd. affiliates last year. It said it would have to pay the higher of fair market value or Carena's capital cost of 55.3 million Canadian dollars (US$46.8 million) plus interest.    Cineplex said it also could lose some lease rights and may have to acquire the 45% minority stake in its British Gallery Cinemas Ltd. subsidiary.    However, Jack Richer, spokesman for the independent directors' committee, played down the effect of these agreements on the quest for a buyer for the company.    &quot;Anyone who's involved in the due diligence process was already aware of these agreements,&quot; Mr. Richer said. &quot;To my knowledge, no one has said they're concerned, and I don't expect the public disclosure to have any effect on the process now under way.&quot;    Mr. Richer added that any buyer would refinance the whole company in any event, making the provisions of the banking agreement &quot;largely irrelevant.&quot;    Cineplex also said it has violated the terms of the $39 million loan, but that it obtained a waiver from the lender to carry it over until the end of next month when Mr. Richer hopes to announce &quot;something definitive&quot; about the company's future.    Mr. Richer said the violation was due to the number of operations Cineplex has discontinued in the last six months, and that the company has &quot;more than enough&quot; cash available through its open lines of credit with the Bank of Nova Scotia to refinance the loan.    Pierre Panet-Raymond, a broker and analyst with Toronto investment dealer McDermid St. Lawrence Ltd., said he is more concerned about the company's ability to continue its expansion program than any &quot;poison pill&quot; provisions that appear to reinforce Mr. Drabinsky's position in the company.    &quot;Frankly, I don't think it's likely the banks will call those loans,&quot; he said. &quot;I think they'll be glad to deal with someone other than {Mr. Drabinsky}, especially with {major Cineplex holders} MCA Inc. and the Bronfmans gone.&quot;    In the SEC filing, Cineplex said its ability to complete its 1989 expansion program will hinge on improved cash flow and the expansion of its bank facilities.    In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Cineplex closed at C$14.125 a share, off 50 Canadian cents. </TEXT></DOC>
