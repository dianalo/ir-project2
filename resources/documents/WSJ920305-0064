It seems a safe bet, however, that most people willescape any damage.   Nevertheless, the companies that make anti-virus softwareare hoping you won't relax. They warn that there are over1,000 computer viruses affecting IBM-compatibles, including astrain timed to wipe out certain programs every Friday the13th (there's one next week). And some have trumpeted thediscovery of a new virus that may cause crashes on AppleComputer's Macintosh machines, which are immune toMichelangelo.   Just how serious is the virus threat? Must every computerowner buy anti-virus software? The answer is that there is areal threat, but it is easily exaggerated by the anti-virussoftware firms. Your need for anti-virus software depends alot on how you use your computers. And though many of theprograms are effective, they have downsides.   Some companies seem to play on fears; a few are warning ofa Maltese Amoeba virus set to erase disk files on March 15.But the independent National Computer Security Association,in Washington, says that of the 1,000-plus viruses known toattack IBM-compatibles, fewer than 50 are common and onlyabout 100 others have also been found &quot;in the wild;&quot; the restare known only to researchers. Last year, the NCSA says, justtwo viruses, JerusalemB and Stoned, accounted for 74% ofvirus incidents in the U.S.; neither wipes out whole disks,as Michelangelo does.   As for the dreaded Maltese Amoeba, the NCSA and others sayit hasn't yet been reported in the U.S. In fact, some of theworst viruses mainly flourish abroad. Mac owners face fewviruses.   So, there's no need to panic, but prudence is in order.Many computers, especially in big organizations, becomeinfected, and most infections screw up the computer. Theworst cases wipe out data or program files.   Lone home users who do little disk swapping or programsharing probably don't need anti-virus software. But in mostother cases -- especially large organizations with manycomputer users -- anti-virus software is advisable. At thevery least, hard disks should be scanned for viruses everymonth or so, and any floppy disk from an outside sourceshould be scanned before use.   Anti-virus programs usually include a scanner, whichoperates on demand or when the machine starts up, and looksfor computer code that matches a set of &quot;signatures&quot;characteristic of known viruses. There's often a separatemodule that eradicates any viruses found. And there'snormally a form of the program that remains in memory at alltimes to check for viruses.   In addition, many programs try to seek unknown viruses bylooking for changes in the size and composition of programfiles on your hard disk, or by monitoring suspicious behaviorbelieved common to viruses.   None of these methods are fool-proof. The programs'database of virus signatures must be updated often to beeffective. Their memory-resident modules can goof up othersoftware by hogging memory. And various techniques of findingunknown viruses might be rendered ineffective if the digitalvandals think up new methods of infection.   Two programs, Novi by Certus, of Cleveland, andUntouchable by Fifth Generation, of Baton Rouge, La., claimsuch good generic virus detection that you don't need toupdate for new virus signatures.   Novi seems to offer the more sophisticated approach,monitoring processes inside programs. The company says itsgeneric technology has caught every new virus for four years.But if you buy these products, I'd suggest continuing to scanfor known viruses and to get updates, which both productsallow.   You probably wouldn't go wrong with any of four packages:Central Point Anti-Virus, by Central Point, Beaverton, Ore.;Viruscan, by McAfee Associates, Santa Clara, Calif.; Certus'sNovi; and ViruSafe by Xtree, San Luis Obispo, Calif. I'dplace another leading package, Norton Anti-Virus, bySymantec, Santa Monica, Calif., a whisker behind.   But the NCSA gives higher marks to two lesser-knownprograms: Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit, sold by OntrackComputer Systems, Eden Prairie, Minn.; and Leprechaun VirusBuster, sold by Leprechaun Software, Marietta, Ga.   Some top virus busters swear by an Icelandic programthat's free to home users and costs businesses just $1 acomputer. Called F-Prot, it's found on database services andbulletin boards, including NCSA's (202-364-1304).   For Macintosh users, two commercial programs stand out:Virex, by Microcom, Norwood, Mass., and Symantec's AntiVirus.But there's also a very good free anti-virus program forMacs, called Disinfectant, by John Norstad of NorthwesternUniversity, available on many bulletin boards.</TEXT></DOC>
