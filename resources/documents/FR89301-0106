Questions regarding grant management requirementsshould be referred to the program manager.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The FAA is engaged in a comprehensive program to modernize the Nation'sairway system to meet the challenge of aviation growth in the coming decades.The modernization program is reflected in the agency's National AirspaceSystem plan which takes advantage of current technological advances toincrease the capacity and efficiency of the Nation's airspace system whilereducing relative costs to the Nation's taxpayers.The FAA recognizes the increasing complexity of technical and managerialskills that will be needed to accommodate the technological advances inequipment, systems and configurations being planned and implemented inthe aviation industry. The FAA decision to sponsor an AWS curriculum wasa direct result of an FAA assessment of the human resources needed to realizethe full benefits of the forthcoming airspace and airway system modernization.Beginning in 1982, in collaboration with the University Aviation Association,the FAA developed and recommended a specific college-level AWS curriculum.The AWS curriculum was designed to satisfy university academic and accreditationrequirements, be easily adaptable to existing aviation-related programs,and yet allow individual educational institutions the option of offeringany number of the five areas of concentration according to their individualresources. (48 FR 32490, July 15, 1983).The five areas of concentration are: (1) airway science management, (2)airway computer science, (3) aircraft systems management, and (4) airwayelectronics systems, and (5) aviation maintenance management. Graduatesof educational institutions offering FAA recognized AWS programs are eligiblefor recruitment by the FAA in one of four agency career fields: Air trafficcontrol, electronics technology, aviation safety inspection (general aviationoperations and maintenance), and computer sciences.The FAA has recognized 32 institutions with one or more airway scienceareas of concentration. Their curricula directly support FAA's human resourceneeds by producing graduates with the necessary knowledge and skills topursue aviation-related technical careers in the public and private sectors.<ITAG tagnum="84">References</ITAG>Those parties interested in the FAA's previous AWS activities may referto the following <T4>Federal Register </T4> Notices: 48 FR 116872, March 18, 1983, (FAAproposed AWS curriculum demonstration project plan); 48 FR 32490, July15, 1983, (Office of Personnel Management approval of the FAA demonstrationproject final plan); 49 FR 22903, June 1, 1984; 50 FR 37612, September16, 1985; and 52 FR 3195, February 2, 1987; (notices announcing the competitivecriteria employed by the FAA in selecting the AWS grant recipients underthe previous 3 solicitations).<ITAG tagnum="84">The Airway Science Grant</ITAG>AuthorityThis solicitation represents a continuation of the FAA's AWS Grant Program.This program funds projects at selected institutions of higher learningwhich have evidenced a commitment to the agency's AWS curriculum program.The grants are authorized by Pub.

Each reviewer will evaluate the proposalsbased on the following factors listed below and rate each proposal on a100-point scale. The evaluation criteria are the following: (a) <T3>Institutional Impact. </T3>Each proposal will be evaluated to determinethe extent to which the applicant institution has demonstrated: (1) The need for funding of its AWS program in terms of the AWS programgoals and objectives; (2) The role grant funding will play in achieving these goals and objectives;(3) The impact the grant funding will have upon the existing AWS program;(4) The consequences to the AWS program if the project is not funded.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(10 points maximum)(b) <T3>Institutional Commitment. </T3>Each proposal will be evaluated as tothe extent of the institution's commitment to the AWS Program in particularand aviation education in general. This includes but is not limited toconsideration of the following: (1) Number and qualifications of dedicated AWS faculty; (2) Number of recognized AWS curriculum options and the number of enrolledstudents; (3) The amount of institutional matching funds provided toward the project;(4) Efforts to obtain other nonfederal sources of funding in support ofthe grant project and the long range plan for the AWS program;(5) Demonstrated continued support and growth of the institution's AWSprogram.(6) Activities other than AWS in support of aviation education at the collegiatelevel.In addition, the Local Review Statement and level of signature will beconsidered in determining the overall commitment of the institution tothe AWS program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(15 points maximum)(c) <T3>Project Plan Quality.</T3> The Project Plan for the proposed AWS projectwill be evaluated in regard to the following:(1) The appropriateness of the project in terms of the institution's currentAWS program;(2) The relationship between the goals and objectives of the proposed projectand those of the overall AWS program at the institution;(3) The adequacy of the institutional resources for achieving the goalsand objectives of the proposed project;(4) The effectiveness of the proposed mechanism for the management andcoordination of the faculty, administrative, facility, and other institutionalresources in achieving the goals and objectives of the proposed project;(5) Project management mechanisms that provide for the effective administrationand technical direction of the project, including the establishment ofspecific project goals and objectives, time-tables for performance andmilestones that permit monitoring of the progress of the project and themeasurement of its overall effectiveness;(6) Adequate institutional budgeting and other fiscal controls that allowfor periodic review of resource commitments and determinations that expendituresare in accordance with the Project Plan;(7) The identification of significant educational, technical and administrativeinnovations as a result of the grant project that would further the attainmentof the institutional and national goals and objectives for the AWS program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(25 points maximum)(d)<T3> Budget Plan.</T3> The Budget Plan must sufficiently detail proposedexpenditures by budget category and line item and show the allocation betweengrant funds and institutional funds and/or equivalent support services.The budget figures should be appropriate for the goods and services beingprocured and consistent with the project narrative presented elsewherein the Project Plan.
