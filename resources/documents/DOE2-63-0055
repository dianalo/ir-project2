Proposalsfor an ultralight cyclotron were made by Finlan et al., who suggesteda novel technique of utilising a superconducting magnet with RF accelerationand iron sectors contained within the room temperature bore of the magnet.Detailed design of a cyclotron based on this concept has progressed wellat Oxford Instruments. The main design priorities were to minimise theweight and power consumption of the cyclotron. The cyclotron requireda large amount of shielding to reduce either radiation background levelsor stray magnetic field. Thus low background levels of radiation andmagnetic field are key design criteria. The superconducting magnet hasa mean field of 2.35 Tesla and a room temperature bore diameter of 500mm. Three pairs of profiled iron sectors placed in the center of thewarm bore of the magnet provide an azimuthally varying magnetic field.This permits the use of high beam currents with low background. A noveltechnique is incorporated to reduce the stray magnetic field and radiationfrom the cyclotron. The RF system consists of three pairs of resonatorsmounted within the warm bore of the magnet between the iron sectors.(Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
