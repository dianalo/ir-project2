The rate fell to 5.4% of the civilian labor force, down from 5.6% in March and the lowest since June 1974, when it was also 5.4%. The last time the rate was lower was in May 1974, when it was 5.1%.    Non-farm business payrolls increased 174,000 after a revised 296,000 March job gain that was previously reported as 262,000. Manufacturing jobs registered strong growth.    As an indication of continuing economic strength, the drop is welcome news to Republican candidates in this election year. At the same time, it brings the rate further below a level that some economists consider &quot;full employment,&quot; at a time financial markets are already worried about inflation and the possibility of credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.    &quot;It is a sign that we are bordering on an overheated situation in the labor market,&quot; said Roger Brinner, director of U.S. forecasting at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. &quot;This should add to nagging worries about whether inflation is going to rise.&quot;    Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, said, &quot;The second quarter looks stronger than the first by a significant margin. I think the Fed has got to move.&quot;    The report is causing some worries among central bankers. Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, said Friday, &quot;There's legitimate concern about inflationary pressures.&quot;    Still, Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has suggested the jobless rate wouldn't reach a level that triggered an inflationary acceleration until it had &quot;slipped down to the low five percents.&quot; And several analysts, pointing to the relatively small increase in payrolls, suggested that the economy isn't yet in a danger zone.    Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said, &quot;The significant number is payroll jobs. Growth is moderate and fears of an inflationary boom are exaggerated.&quot;    The payroll increase was the smallest since a 159,000-job rise last September. It included a strong 44,000-job gain in manufacturing employment, mostly in export-related industries, after a rise of 12,000 in March. Weekly factory hours rose to an average 41.2 from 41, with overtime increasing to four hours from 3.7.    Total weekly hours averaged 34.9, up from 34.6 in March.    Overall, goods-producing employment, which includes mining and construction as well as manufacturing, was up 57,000 in April after a rise of 95,000 in March. The increase in service jobs eased a bit, with a rise of 117,000 jobs after a March gain of 201,000.    The department's survey of households, which is used in calculating the unemployment rate, showed a rise of 610,000 jobs after a 306,000 drop in March. The civilian labor force increased 420,000 after a 445,000-job contraction. Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, cautioned against looking at April's household data &quot;in isolation,&quot; however, given the erratic movements of the figures in the past few months.    The jobless rate fell or was unchanged last month for all groups but Hispanics. Hispanic unemployment rose to 9.3% from 8.2%.    Two inflation measures in the report posted big increases. Average hourly earnings rose to $9.22 in April from $9.17 in March and $9.13 in February. The department's hourly earnings index, which excludes wage changes caused by factory overtime and shift differentials, rose to 177.6% of its 1977 average from 176.8% in March and 176.5% in February.    The figures are adjusted for seasonal variation.    Here are excerpts from the Labor Department's employment report. The figures are seasonally adjusted.
