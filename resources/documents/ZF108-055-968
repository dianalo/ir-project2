virtually no twoCD-ROM data bases currently work in the same way.andP;  The need tolearn new user interfaces for each disk is an especially seriousproblem in data-intensive businesses, where valuable time iswasted teaching users how to retrieve information.andO;Standardization of CD-ROM interfaces would allow data independenceand would greatly expand the market for large data bases in suchfields as the aerospace industry.andP;  The Aerospace IndustryAssociation and Airline Transport Association are working onStructured Full-Text Query Language, a standard for CD-ROMdocument delivery that uses a client/server model.andP;  Each databasewould come with back-end retrieval software;

format:beginning next tissue, the table of contents will appear on a page numberedby the formula (VN*IN) MOD 420, where VN is the volume number and IN is theissue number.andP;  The First Looks section will be distributed throughout themagazine on pages whose numbers are determined by a secret method based onthe New York Lotto's selections for the previous Saturday.andP;  Fear not, loyalreader: you'll always find this column seven pages after the advertisementthat contains the most white space.andM;Not true.andP;  A fib.andP;  But that's just the sort of irritation CD-ROM users mustcontend with every time they shove a new disk in the drive.andP;  Here in myoffice, I've got review copies of maybe two dozen compact disks, no two ofwhich work exactly the same way.andP;  The retrieval software, bundled with anessential to each disk, is different for virtually every one; in fact, it caneven vary among products from a single vendor.andP;  Admittedly, consistencyhasn't been one of the computer industry's strong points, but the situationhere is ridiculous.andP;  It's as though you had to learn a new word processorsystem every time you wrote about a new topic.andM;So far the CD-ROM is confined mostly to the world of reference works,catalogs, and service manuals.andP;  Ask any librarian who has scrounged enoughfunds for more than one disk: inevitably, he or she has had to learn a newuser interface for each one.andP;  No wonder librarians tend to keep CDs behindthe desk and perform searches themselves rather than letting users do it.andO;It's just too hard to teach users all the ins and outs of the dozens ofdifferent schemes.andM;The problem becomes even worse in a data-intensive business such asaerospace.andP;  Since, as industry lore has it, the documentation for an airplanecan be as large as the plane itself, CD-ROM technology seems perfectly suitedfor this kind of data.andP;  But if you're the maintenance director at LeadballoonWorld Airway, your fleet is likely to include an assortment of planes fromvarious manufacturers.andP;  If the information is supplied on CD-ROM, it's a safebet that your mechanics will be obligated to learn a different method ofretrieving the information on each vendor's disk.andP;  Result: a potentialproductivity gain turns into an unnecessary time-waster.andM;FREE AND WORTH ITandM;There's a growing sense among potential and actual CD-ROM users that the dataon a disk should be in some way independent from the software used toretrieve it.andP;  This is precisely the opposite of the current situation wherethe data comes alive only with the retrieval software that's tossed in forfree (and usually worth about that much).andM;It's reasonable to think that standardization would be good for the datavendors, too.andP;  After all, it was an agreement about the low-level encodingand layout of data on the disks, originally known as the High Sierra formatand now formalized as ISO 9660, that got CD-ROM off and running (thoughslowly).andP;  Along with Microsoft's CD-ROM Extensions, the ISO standard meantthat software could address the CD-ROM as just another drive.andM;But ISO 9660 remains silent on the question of how to structure the data.andO;Every vendor uses a different proprietary scheme, just as every wordprocessor creates files in its own proprietary format.andP;  The difference isthat if somebody sends you a Word Perfect file, you can go out and buysomething that will read or convert it.andP;  When it comes to CD-ROMs, you'reusually stuck with the less-than-stellar software you've been handed.andM;Enter the aerospace industry, which has begun to flex its muscles to speedthe adoption of the standards it deems desiriable.andP;  Most recently, it pushedfor the adoption, in this country, of the X.400 electronic mail interchangeformat developed by government-owned European national telecommunicationsmonopolies.andP;  Some competitive American e-mail vendors originally looked uponX.400 as a slippery slope leading to the commoditization of their industry.andO;But since those American vendors can't afford to write off a market aspotentially huge as aerospace, they've begun to fall into line behing theX.400 standard.andM;The same thing might happen with SFQL (Structured Full-Text Query Language),a standard for electronic document delivery on CD-ROM that is currently underdevelopment by a working committee of the AIA (Aerospace IndustryAssociation) and ATA (Airline Transport Association).andP;  If it sounds vaguelyfamiliar, it ought to: SFQL adds what the popular SQL standard leaves out--amechanism for retrieving information from unstructured full-text documents.andO;When finalized, the SFQL standard should also include some sort of mechanismfor accessing graphics, along with the ability to access structure SQLdatabase.andM;DOING THE SCUT WORKandM;SFQL uses what industry jargon calls a client-server model.andP;  What this meansis that a CD-ROM database would come with back-end retrieval softwaredesigned to process standard queries from users and to retrieve the relevantinformation from the database.andP;  The front-end software would contain the userinterface, plus the client code that passes properly formed queries to theserver.andP;  Since the back end would take care of the scut work of finding thedata and decompressing it in a standard, dependable way, the user coulddesign (or but) any kind of front-end software to work with this standardizedback end.andM;This sounds like nirvana for users who routinely need information from morethan one CD-ROM.andP;  Learn one user interface, and you could access anySFQL-standard disk.andP;  There'd be no worry (as there is now) about whichsoftware to use when accessing a bunch of different CD-ROMs on a network: onefront end would fit all.andM;The concept of separating the data from the software that ultimatelyretrieves it is so important for users that it ought to carry the day.andO;Still, oppositions to standards is only to be expected.andP;  Just as thebarrier-breaking X.400 electronic-mail standard (and its companion, the X.500directory standard) pushes electronic mail down the road to becoming acommodity like long-distance phone service, separating data from retrieval islikely to commoditize the retrieval-engine business, opening it up tocompetition on such terms as quality and price.andP;  Vendors who offer neithermay protest.andM;SFQL may not be the only way, or even the best way, to separate the innardsof the database cat from its user-interface skin.andP;  But something like it hasgot to free us from the tyranny of proprietary data-linked CD-ROM retrievalsoftware--and maybe, down the road, from the tyranny of proprietary on-lineretrieval software as well.andP;  As usual, freedom of choice beatstake-it-or-leave-it all hollow.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
