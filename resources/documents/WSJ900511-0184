McWethy</HL><DATE>05/11/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE R27</SO><IN>HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, MEDICINE, DENTISTRY (HEA)</IN><LP>   FOUR OUT OF 10 cardiologists take an aspirin tablet --either once a day or every other day -- to reduce their ownrisk of heart attack.   That was among the findings of a Wall Street Journalsurvey of cardiologists, doctors who specialize in treatingpeople for heart disorders. The purpose of the survey was todetermine not what cardiologists advise their patients to dobut what they themselves do in their daily lives to preventheart disease.</LP><TEXT>   Four hundred cardiologists participated in the survey, inthe form of a written questionnaire. In addition to formalquestions, the doctors were also invited to provide writtencomments.   The findings indicated that cardiologists tend to be moreaggressive than the general population in taking steps toavoid heart disease in their own bodies. For instance, 63%said they get a good cardiovascular workout at least threetimes a week, and almost 98% said they don't smokecigarettes.   &quot;Risk-factor control is very important. I practice what Ipreach,&quot; said one physician. Another, W.F. Haynes Jr., acardiologist who practices in Princeton, N.J., wrote:&quot;Aerobics are the most important factor. I compete inswimming and I'm 63 years old.&quot;   The doctors were probably most adamant on the subject ofsmoking. &quot;I rarely see any patient with heart problems underthe age of 65 -- unless they are smokers,&quot; said onecardiologist. Another wrote that he blamed cigarettes for hisfather's fatal heart attack, at age 47.   Based on their own example, the doctors rate the followingas the most important preventive steps: stopping smoking;altering diet to reduce cholesterol; limiting intake of salt;exercising; and taking aspirin.   Perhaps the most surprising result of the survey was thelarge number of doctors who take aspirin -- especially giventhe continuing medical controversy over whether aspirinactually reduces the mortality rate. (Studies show it canincrease the risk of bleeding ulcer or stroke.) Of the 40%who said they take aspirin, roughly half said they take asingle tablet every day, while the rest said they take onetablet every other day.   The least popular action: eating oat bran. Only a third ofthe doctors said they make a special effort to include oatbran in their diets.   The cardiologists clearly felt these steps improved theirodds of survival. Asked about their own chances of dying froma heart attack, 82% of the doctors said they thought thattheir risk was equal to or below that of individuals of thesame age and sex. Only 18% thought their risks were greater-- most of them citing either known heart disease or thestress associated with their profession.   All but 4% of the doctors said they've tested their owncholesterol levels; 17% said their levels were too high.About 60% had gone a step further and taken at least onetreadmill stress test.   Only 6% of the survey respondents said they have heartdisease now.   A number of the doctors, however, wrote that they oftenhave trouble following their own advice. &quot;My motivation toexercise is like a yo-yo,&quot; said C.G. Reddy, a cardiologist inColumbus, Ohio. Another doctor wrote: &quot;I wish the fast-foodindustry would create a prudent pizza.&quot;   Some said they believe the craze over cholesterol isoverblown. &quot;The wrong segment of our population -- elderlyfemales and nonsmoking women -- are overly concerned abouttheir cholesterol, while men who smoke or who havesignificant family history {of heart disease} are not,&quot;complained one physician.   Reed J. Wilson, a doctor in Beverly Hills, Calif., saidthat the population's obssession with cholesterol wasintruding in his life. &quot;I recently attended a charity affair.I chose meat over fish for dinner, and through the whole mealI had to listen to each person's opinion of my diet. It wasdifficult not to comment as I watched each of them put ranchdressing on their `healthy salads,' thick hollandaise sauceon their `healthy fish' and then finish with a heavy layer ofcaramel and chocolate on their ice-cream dessert (oh, butthey only ate half).&quot;   Several doctors expressed the belief that the professionis on the verge of making great strides in reducing heartattacks. &quot;I believe aggressive vegetarian regimens andrelaxation techniques can reverse heart disease,&quot; said J.Gary Grant, a cardiologist in Pacific Grove, Calif. Anotherdoctor, James Nilson, wrote: &quot;A more thorough analysis ofrisk factors, together with improved techniques for earlydetection, should decrease the incidence of {heart atttacks}in our country markedly.&quot;   ---   Mr. Koten, chief of The Wall Street Journal's Chicagobureau, served as contributing editor of this Wall StreetJournal Report.
