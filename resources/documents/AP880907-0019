SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The number of Hispanics has grown by more thanone-third since 1980 and now represents 8.1 percent of the nation'spopulation, the Census Bureau says.   In a report issued Tuesday, the bureau also said the rate ofHispanic growth is nearly five times that for the rest of thepopulation, and more than half of all Hispanics in this countrylive in just two states: California and Texas.   The bureau estimated there were 19.4 million Americans ofHispanic background as of last March. That is 34 percent more thanthe 14.5 million people who listed themselves as Hispanics in the1980 census.   The nation's non-Hispanic population increased by about 7percent in the same period.   About half the Hispanic increase was a result of immigration andhalf resulted from birth rates exceeding death rates.   While people of Spanish ancestry made up a growing share of thenation's residents, they are extremely concentrated geographically,the bureau found. About one-third, 33.9 percent, live inCalifornia, and 21.3 percent live in Texas, meaning those twostates account for well over half of all Hispanics in the UnitedStates.   The study did not estimate the Hispanic population of everystate, but it said that nearly 90 percent live in just nine states.   Those are California, 6.6 million; Texas, 4.1 million; New York,2.1 million; Florida, 1.5 million; Illinois, 801,000; Arizona,648,000; New Jersey, 646,000; New Mexico, 543,000, and Colorado,368,000.   Other findings of the report include:   _The unemployment rate among Hispanics was 8.5 percent, comparedwith 5.8 percent for non-Hispanics.   _People of Mexican heritage were the largest Hispanic group at12.1 million. They were followed by Puerto Ricans living on theU.S. mainland, 2.5 million; Central and South Americans, 2.2million; and Cubans, 1 million.   _The proportion of Hispanic families anchored by a marriedcouple was 70 percent, down from 74 percent when it was lastmeasured in 1982. At the same time, the share of families headed bya woman with no spouse present increased from 26 percent to 30percent.   _More than half (51 percent) of Hispanics have completed highschool, and 10 percent have completed four years of college. Thatstill trails non-Hispanics, of whom 78 percent are high schoolgraduates and 21 percent have finished college.</TEXT></DOC>
