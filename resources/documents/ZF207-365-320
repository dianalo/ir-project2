(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>PostScript-Clone Printers: Healthy Competition for AdobeandM;FOR MORE THAN a year and a half, we've been talking about the imminentarrival of PostScript clones.andP;  It's been a long wait for deliverableproducts; despite the early announcements by some software houses, no one hasbeen shipping goods for more than a few months.andP;  However, as our story willdetail, the clones are here in force now, and some of them are quite good.andM;The hard part.andP;  Almost as soon as Adobe published the definition of thelanguage, other developers set out to try to implement their own PostScriptinterpreters.andP;  It proved to be harder than many of them expected.andP;  Some foundthat the language definition in the Red Book was not sufficiently precise toserve as the specification of a marketable product.andP;  Many found that the defacto definition of the language that users would accept was that the AppleLaserWriter did, not what the Red Book said.andM;The hardest part, it turned out, was the problem of scaling fonts in aconsistent and aesthetically pleasing way.andP;  Letters are among the most subtlydesigned graphic forms.andP;  Although everyone uses type all the time, and takeslettering for granted, rendering type is as much an art as a science.andP;  Tryingto do so on a medium of limited resolving power (toner on plain paper)complicates the matter considerably.andM;Market segments.andP;  The PostScript printer market has now grown quite diverse.andO;Some vendors have chosen to step aside from the direct competition,preferring to develop specialty products that provide some PostScript-likefunctionality.andP;  LaserMaster comes to mind as an example; it makes a fastcontroller (the CAPcard) that is very powerful for CAD applications, wordprocessing and certain kinds of graphics.andP;  However, it does not implement thePostScript language, and, we believe, lacks the full graphic capability ofPostScript.andP;  We are not reviewing such products here.andM;Among the competitors that have implemented true PostScript functionality, wetend to see products in three different categories.andP;  First are theself-contained printers, which combine a marketing engine with an embeddedcontroller and various interfaces to desktop computers.andP;  Second are theplug-in  controllers, which rely on a host computer for font storage andsoftware loading (and power supply), but which drive an external markingengine that you supply.andP;  Third are the software-only products, which use thecomputing resources of your desktop computer to drive your marking engine.andO;In each of these segments, there are real differences in quality, speed andprice.andM;The tests.andP;  We gathered a sampling of the clone products on the market andused them for routine work over a period of time in our offices.andP;  Inaddition, we performed more formal tests: timings of specific jobs underconditions as nearly alike as we could make them.andP;  Our tests wererepresentative of the kind of jobs that crop up in ordinary publishing work:pages of text and various kinds of graphics.andP;  We did not attempt to formulate&quot;killer&quot; tests, just ordinary pages like those we use every month in TheSeybold Report.andM;We also did not attempt to certify the correctness of the PostScriptimplementations; that can only be done by exercising each of the 200+PostScript operators in turn, giving them all possible combinations of validinputs and examining all results.andP;  We do think that certification isimportant--even though every application today works perfectly, a hot newprogram could come along tomorrow and bring to light some unsuspectedincompatibility.andP;  But that is a job for firms like Desktop PublishingSolutions, which has developed specialized expertise in a very technicalarena.andM;A summary of our test procedures appears on page 19.andP;  Just as important asthe speed test results are the samples of output we obtained.andP;  These, afterall, are the proof of pudding that really matters.andM;We caution you, however, that the quality of the reproduced image (which hasbeen photographed, burned onto a plate, then printed on an offset press) maynot be exactly what you would see if you looked at the original output.andP;  Thismay or may not matter to you: if you want a printer to make camera-readymasters, our reproductions should be a reasonably valid benchmark.andP;  On theother hand, if you want a printer for making overhead transparencies,point-of-sale signs, or office correspondence, you should be aware that theprinting process can improve some aspects of laser-printer output whiledamaging others.andM;Standalone PrintersandM;Convenience is what a standalone printer is all about.andP;  The manufacturer hasmatched a printing engine with a controller, including interfaces to yourcomputer, so that all you have to do is plug the printer in and turn on thepower.andP;  Looking at two such printers on the market, Apple's LaserWriter andQume's CrystalPrint Publisher, we found that each offered a convenientpackage, but each had some inconvenient aspects that would tip the balancefor some applications.andM;The sticker price for a complete printer looks much higher than the cost of aPC card, but it really isn't when you consider the cost of the markingengine.andP;  If you don't already own a laser printer, there's little saved bybuying the engine separately from the controller, and the burden of puttingit all together is squarely on your own shoulders.andM;Engine tests.andP;  In addition to timing the speed of output, which measures thecontroller's efficiency more than anything else, we took a close look at thequality the marking engine could deliver.andP;  The &quot;rosette of grays&quot; test, forinstance, shows the engine's ability to render gray tints ranging from 10% to90%; we would want to see tiny white holes in the 90% screen, and we'd bedisappointed if the tiny black dots in the the 10% screen were to drop out.andO;Both printers that we tested handled this test well.andM;The Lady Golfer image, on the other hand, is more of a test of paper movementand vibration.andP;  We look for the smoothness and uniformity of the gray areas;any stripes or bands are a symptom of poor mechanical stability.andP;  Again, bothof our test printers were quite good in this regard.andP;  We believe that the artof making engines has reached the point that no one ought to put up withanything less.andM;These tests are much less meaningful for the PC card controllers andpure-software RIPs that we will look at on subsequent pages.andP;  Marking enginequality is something the card or the software has little control over.andM;Apple LaserWriter IINTXandM;Although the focus of our article is on clones, we felt that it would beimportant to include the LaserWriter as a baseline for comparison.andP;  In manyrespects, Apple's LaserWriter is the industry standard.andP;  Several of thecloners have attempted a &quot;warts-and-all&quot; duplication of the LaserWriter'sfunctions,  including the known bugs, rather than a fresh implementation ofthe PostScript language as defined in the Red Book.andP;  Nearly all the clonersposition their products by comparison to the  LaserWriter.andM;Although the cloners usually make their speed claims relative to the originalApple LaserWriter, we have based our own comparisons on the LaserWriter IINTXmodel (hereafter called &quot;NTX&quot;).andP;  This is more realistic in today's market.andM;Hardware.andP;  Like the HP LaserJet Series II, Apple's NTX is based on the CanonSX engine.andP;  When the SX first came out, we had expressed fears that theprinted output would be undesirably bolder than what the older CX engineproduced.andP;  But we rapidly discovered that the proper adjustment of thedensity control would compensate for the darkening effects of the redesignedelectrostatics and tone.andP;  In our day-to-day use of the machine, we have beenquite satisfied with the print quality.andM;The PstScript RIP is based on a 68020 processor and delivers reasonable speedeven on complex images.andP;  It has 2 MB of working memory, which would support asmall number of downloaded fonts.andP;  The memory can be expanded to 12 MB.andP;  Wehave not done so, however.andP;  We have not run into any memory-limitationproblems, and the chips are still rather  expensive.andM;Fonts.andP;  What we like best about the printers is that you can attach a SCSIdisk for font storage.andP;  The RIP uses any disk space not required for storingfont outlines to cache the font bitmaps that it has already generated.andP;  Thissaves printing time: if a bitmap can be found in the cache, the RIP doesn'thave to take the time to rasterize a new set of outlines.andM;Even a 20-MB disk can hold all of Adobe's currently released fonts.andP;  A biggerdisk is not wasted, however.andP;  Not only does it offer room for the fonts thatyou will probably buy in the future, but the larger bitmap cache will resultin a faster printer.andM;Ergonomics.andP;  While we are singing the praises of the NTX, we ought to pointout a few drawbacks.andP;  The ergonomic design of the NTX is almost the worst wehave encountered.andP;  The paper tray is on one side of the machine; sincerefilling the paper is a frequent operation, you would probably set theprinter up to make that side easily accessible.andP;  But the cable connectors andsetup switches are on the opposite side, and the status lights are on a thirdside.andP;  To switch the printer from Macintoshes to PCs, you have to change arow of tiny DIP-switches located as close to the bottom of the printer asApple could get them.andP;  You also have to open the manual up, because there isnothing iconic or obvious about the switch settings.andP;  They are not labeled atall.andP;  Our advice to anyone buying an Apple printer for a mixed PC/Macenvironment: put it on a lazy Susan and keep the manual close by.andM;Apple Computer, Inc., 20525 Mariani Ave., Cupertino, CA 95014; (408)996-1010.andM;Qume CrystalPrint PublisherandM;Jasmine DirectPrintandM;These two printers are twin brothers.andP;  They are identical except for theirmarketing and the color of paint on the case--so much so that we will discussthem as though they were one.andP;  Pricing and distribution, however, are treatedas separate issues.andM;After working with both machines for the past couple of months, we find thatwe have mixed feelings about them.andP;  On the whole, they are very nice printerswith, alas, a few regrettable shortcomings.andM;The hardware.andP;  The printer is manufactured by Qume, and it is based on theCasio 300-dpi LCS engine.andP;  This uses a liquid-crystal shutter array (a row oftiny, closely spaced liquid-crystal windows that act as optical on-offswitches) to form images, rather than the laser and rotating mirrorarrangement of a Canon or Ricoh laser printer.andP;  The PostScript controlleruses the Weitek XL-8200 chip set and software based on Weitek's HyperScript.andM;The base machine has 35 Bitstream fonts in ROM--the standard LaserWriter Plusfont complement.andP;  It has 3 MB of RAM, which is ample space for lots of cachedfont bitmaps, complex page descriptions or several downloaded fonts.andM;The good.andP;  The printer has many good points, and we are going to miss it whenwe have to give it back.andM;* It is compact--smaller than any other laser printer we've seen, with afootprint barely larger than the letter-size paper it prints on.andM;* It is relatively light as printers go, a mere 40 lbs.andP;  On severaloccasions, we preferred to move the printer nearer to a PC rather than drapea cable across the floor.andP;  One of our staffers took the printer home over aweekend and reported no difficulty in lifting it in and out of his stationwagon.andM;* It has all the common communication interfaces for both PC and Macintosh:Centronics parallel, RS-232 and RS-422 serial from 300 bps to 19,200 bps (itwill actually go to 38,400 in RS-422 mode), and LocalTalk.andM;We wondered what speed difference the various communication channels mightmake.andP;  Obviously, a higher baud rate would allow faster printing, but howwould the serial channel compare with the Centronics or LocalTalk port?andO;Here's how our timings of an 11-page Ventura document turned out: LocalTalk 3:28 (min.:sec.) Centronics 4:31 9600-bps  5:11andM;* Changing the communication parameters is a simple task.andP;  The front panelhas two buttons, Scan Functions and Execute Function, that step you through ahierarchy of choices.andP;  When you have finished making changes, it prints a newtest sheet to confirm the settings that are in effect.andP;  You do not have toswitch power off and on to change channels.andM;* All the user access--setting the controls, reading the status indicator andloading paper--is from one side of the machine: the front.andP;  Only the powerswitch is on a different side.andP;  You can thus back the machine up into acorner of your office.andP;  It stands in stark contrast to the ergonomics ofApple's LaserWriter series.andM;* The print quality is quite good.andP;  Bitstream's fonts carry their own hints;the font encoding and the scaling algorithms are different from Adobe's, butthe results are just as effective.andM;The bad.andP;  Alas, the printer is not quite perfect.andM;* Paper handling.andP;  The printer is very picky about which types of paper itwill use.andP;  It often refused to print on our letterhead or labels.andP;  When itjammed, we often had to move the toner and drum assembly out of the way toextricate the offending sheet.andP;  This is a delicate process at best.andM;Qume says that a number of its early production units did have paper handlingproblems, but that a simple adjustment to the tension of some springs and arepair to the paper tray have overcome the problems.andM;* Small paper tray.andP;  The input paper tray holds only about 100 sheets ofcopier paper.andP;  With the printer attached to our LocalTalk network, we seemedto be constantly interrupted to reload paper.andM;* No font disk.andP;  We think that a modern printer should have some provisionfor expanding the permanent font collection.andP;  This could be a SCSI disk portor a ROM cartridge slot, but it should be something that an individual usercan install.andP;  Perhaps a future version will offer such a feature.andM;Upgrades.andP;  As noted, the printer renders type fairly well.andP;  It does, however,have a bug in its ROMs that affects downloaded Fontware fonts.andP;  This has beenpublicly acknowledged, and both Jasmine and Qume will offer a ROM upgrade fora nominal charge.andM;In addition, both firms will begin to make an improved version of the markingengine available this summer.andP;  The paper path has been reengineered to permitattachment of a sheet feeder.andP;  It's not a simple retrofit; rather, the entireengine must be replaced.andP;  Qume has no official plans to upgrade machinesalready in the field; instead it will simply begin selling the new versionwhen Casio begins deliveries.andP;  Jasmine will do the same but said it wasconsidering offering upgrades to existing users at some nominal charge,perhaps just the freight cost to ship the unit back to Jasmine.andM;Marketing.andP;  Jasmine, which is well known for its line of SCSI disk drives andother peripherals, sells the DirectPrint by mail order and through a smallnetwork of dealers.andP;  It prices its version of the printer at $3,495.andM;Qume has long been a leader in the printer business.andP;  The CrystalPrintPublisher is just one member of a family of LCD printers; there arelower-function printers offering only Diablo emulation or LaserJet emulation.andO;It sells these through computer retailers, VARs and its own sales force.andP;  TheCrystalPrint Publisher has a list price of $4,495.andP;  This higher price tagmeans that you will more likely find the Qume version at your local store;few retailers can live on the margins that Jasmine's pricing would permit.andM;PC-Card RIPSandM;We have sometimes wondered why anyone would buy a PostScript card to add to aLaserJet or other printer.andP;  Adding the cost of the card to the cost of theprinter, you find you haven't saved any money over a good standalonePostScript printer.andM;One answer is that this route is an upgrade path for those who already own alaser printer.andP;  If you needs grow beyond the limits of the PCL language (thatis, LaserJet emulation), you don't have to scrap the printer to move up toPostScript.andP;  You only have to change the controller.andM;Another answer is time-sharing.andP;  Some users can't justify buying a newPostScript printer for the amount of work that they intend to put through it.andO;But if they have access to a lower-function printer that is alreadyinstalled, they can run occasional PostScript jobs on it without removing itfrom its primary tasks.andP;  Just plug in the PostScript interface card as asecond port on the printer; it will take work from whichever port is active.andO;You do have to be careful that only one user at a time tries to print.andM;Networking.andP;  This form of printer sharing is not the same as networking theprinter.andP;  In fact, the PC-card approach could (in principle) be used with anetwork printer by putting the card in the file server or in a dedicatedprint server.andM;In practice, that would be difficult for the end user to do.andP;  A few networkfile servers use orthodox MS-DOS as their internal operating system--3Com isone--and these cards should be compatible with such systems.andP;  But thecomplicating factor is fonts: unless you plan to be satisfied with thestartup library, which is limited to what fits in the card's memory, you willfind these devices very frustrating.andM;The exception is Eicon, whose card is able to fetch its own fonts as needed.andO;We think this is the only card that approaches a standalone printer forconvenience of operation.andM;The products.andP;  We worked with three PostScript controllers that fit into thecard cage of a PC:andM;* Destiny PageStylerandM;* Eicon LPA (EiconScript)andM;* RIPS Image 4000 (RIPS PDL)andM;In terms of installation and daily use, they are all quite similar.andM;As a rule, installation requires running an install program before pluggingthe board into the computer.andP;  The program copies the fonts and theinterpreter code onto the PC's disk, but it also examines the other hardwarealready in the PC to check for port conflicts.andP;  (If the RIP board wereplugged in during the test, it would look like one more conflict.)andP;  Ifnecessary, the install routine may instruct you to set DIPswitches before youplug in the board.andP;  The exception to this rule is Eicon's board; it must beplugged in before you load the software.andP;  Fortunately, the DIPswitches areright at the top of the board, so they can be changed easily even in a fullPC.andM;All three controllers use stacked circuit boards, although Destiny and Eicononly use the stacked board for the memory upgrade option.andP;  This makes thecontroller fairly thick.andP;  You might have to juggle the placement of cards inyour PC to get all of them to fit.andP;  You might also be unable to place one ofthese controllers next to another fat card, and in some cases you wouldprobably want to slide a plastic sheet between the cards in adjacent slots toprevent short circuits.andM;Missing in action.andP;  We had initially intended to include Conographic'sConoDesk 6000 board in our series.andP;  However, we decided not to.andP;  Conographicsays that it is no longer  positioning its ConoDesk 6000 as a PostScriptproduct.andP;  Instead, it sells boards on the merits of its native-code driversfor Ventura Publisher and Microsoft Windows; the PostScript emulation is moreor less a side benefit.andP;  In view of the quality of Conographic's PostScriptoutput, we think this is a wise decision.andM;Configuration.andP;  The cards we used configure themselves as an LPT (parallelprinter) device.andP;  If you already have LPTI installed (it's usually part ofthe screen display card), the PostScript board automatically becomes LPT2 or,if necessary, LPT3.andP;  Destiny offers you the option to use its board as an EPTdevice; there is no operational differences unless you are running underWindows, in which case you have to add it to your WIN.INI file.andP;  You might dothis if you already had three physical devices using your LPT ports.andM;Interfacing.andP;  The cards attach to the printer (in our case, an HP LaserJetSeries II) by a thick cable and an interface card that plugs into theprinter.andP;  Details of this interface vary from printer to printer.andP;  Themanuals for all three cards we used were fully adequate in explaining theprocedure.andM;Destiny PageStylerandM;The Destiny PageStyler proved to be the slowest, on average, of the three PCcards we tested.andP;  However, for many kinds of jobs the speed differences werenot all that large.andP;  We would cheerfully balance that factor against theprice tag; it was the lowest of our group.andM;Hardware.andP;  The Destiny board is based on a 68000 processor.andP;  It also usessome proprietary chips for bus interfacing.andP;  There are two models of theproduct: one with 2 MB of memory, the other with 4 MB.andP;  The main differenceis the number of fonts you can have resident while you are running.andP;  With 2MB, you are limited to 16 or 17 fonts (the basis 13 plus three or fourdownloaded fonts); with 4 MB, you can hold the full LaserWriter Pluscomplement of 35 faces.andM;We found the Destiny product easy to intall.andP;  The instruction manual isnothing if not comprehensive--it even tells you how to remove the cover ofthe PC.andP;  We imagine that some users will find that level of detailcomforting.andP;  Old pros at configuring hardware will find that the installationprogram gives sufficient information that you don't really need to read themanual.andP;  It also modifies your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files for you.andM;Bootup.andP;  When you first power up, the PageStyler software is loaded by yourAUTOEXEC file.andP;  This is a time-consuming process, taking a full two minutesbefore you get your C-prompt.andP;  It takes an additional minute for the board toinitialize itself and print a test page.andM;Fortunately, you only have to do this at power-up time.andP;  When you reboot, theloader program is smart enough to detect that the software is alreadyinstalled on the board.andM;In use.andP;  The card presents itself to DOS applications as an LPT device.andP;  ForMicrosoft Windows applications, it appears as an EPT device.andP;  When you sendit a file, it blinks the LaserJet's lights to show that it is working.andP;  Weappreciated this,  particularly on time-consuming graphics files.andM;Destiny includes a nice device-status management program.andP;  With it, you cansee the status of the PostScript interpreter, queue up jobs for printing,download fonts, and enter the interactive mode of PostScript.andM;Fonts.andP;  Essentially, all fonts are downloaded.andP;  There is a utility toconfigure the fonts that will be loaded at startup time; it also can preparebatch files that load additional fonts upon command.andP;  Destiny buys its fontsfrom Bitstream, but any unencrypted PostScript fonts can be used.andP;  Aname-equivalence table must be updated if your application uses Adobe fontnames.andM;Once they are loaded, you cannot get rid of the fonts until you turn off thepower.andP;  Simply rebooting the computer won't do it; the initialization programdetects that the Destiny board is still loaded and will not do anything.andP;  Wethink that Destiny should supply a better way to unload fonts you no longerneed.andM;Drives: Canon LBP-8 II, Canon SX engine printers (LaserJet Series II andclones) and Ricoh 1060-based printers.andM;Eicon Technology's LPAandM;Of all the PC-based clones we tested, we were most impressed by Eicon's LPAboard.andP;  It is the only PC plug-in we've seen that uses the resources of thePC in an intelligent way, by acting as a bus master.andP;  It is not a true DMAbus master--it needs about 40K of support code that is executed by the PC'sprocessor--but it can carry out most of its operations autonomously, leavingthe PC free for other work.andM;We tested Eicon's 400-dpi version of the LPA, driving a special 400-dpiversion of the Canon SX engine that Eicon sells.andP;  We were impressed with thequality of output.andP;  This engine is not merely a 300-dpi printer being drivenhard; it has a smaller spot size to correspond with the 400 x 400-dpiaddressability.andM;Eicon also sent us a 300-dpi board with an interface to our LaserJet, but theinterface card was dead on arrival.andP;  (That's why there are warranties.)andP;  Wethus could not test Eicon's print quality at 300 dpi, but from samples wehave seen at shows, we would expect it to be acceptable.andP;  In all otherrespects, we would expect the product to behave just like the 400-dpi model.andM;Hardware.andP;  The LPA card uses a 68000 processor along with a bus interfacechip of Eicon's own design.andP;  The base model card has 2 MB of memory, but thiscan be upgraded to 4 MB.andP;  The extra memory can be used as a larger workspacefor complex page descriptions, font bitmaps, and so on.andP;  But it also enablesyou to drive the laser printer engine at double resolution.andP;  That is, a300-dpi engine can be run at 300 x 300, but by reconfiguring the software youcan use the same engine at 600 x 300 dpi for a modest improvement in imagequality.andP;  Eicon's 400-dpi printer, we are told, can be juiced up to 800 x400, but the driver configuration software for this wasn't provided for ourtesting.andM;One thing you won't need extra memory for is downloaded fonts.andP;  The LPA cardis able to fetch font outlines from the PC's hard disk on its own initiativewhen it needs them.andP;  (Applications that download fonts during printing, suchas PageMaker and Ventura Publisher, can still do so.)andP;  The only thing youmust do is copy the font into the right disk directory and add the name ofthe font to a synonym table.andP;  Most applications call fonts by their Adobenames, but due to trademark restrictions, clone fonts are generallydistributed under different names.andP;  The synonym table straightens this out.andM;Bootup.andP;  The EiconScript software takes about 12 seconds to be loaded.andP;  It isreloaded each time you reset the computer.andP;  A configuration-file settingdetermines whether a test page is printed.andM;In use.andP;  Although this is not the fastest of all the products, its apparentspeed is greatly increased by its ability to print autonomously, freeing theCPU for other work.andP;  Because it can become a bus master, it can fetch fontsand page description files from the disk as it needs them.andM;We were very impressed by this feature.andP;  To see if having another devicecommander the bus now and then would affect performance of the foregroundtask, we started the card printing a PageMaker file.andP;  It accepted the commandand immediately gave the C-prompt back, so we fired up Ventura and startedrearranging a page.andP;  We did not notice any degradation in Ventura's mouseresponse or typing speed.andP;  However, we were very surprised when we noticedthat the Eicon board actually finished printing its file faster than it hadas a stand-alone job!andM;Networking.andP;  The ability to run autonomously would also be useful when thecard is intalled in a network file server.andP;  Not all LAN file servers arecompatible with the Eicon card, but the IBM-brand networks are.andP;  NovellNetware itself is not compatible, but several third-party spoolers that runon top of Netware can use the Eicon card.andM;Fonts.andP;  Eicon uses Bitstream fonts.andP;  As noted above, there is no need forspecial downloading procedures.andM;Drives: Canon CX and SX printers.andP;  A special version of the SX engine,designed for 400 dpi, is available.andP;  European users can buy these directlyfrom Canon.andP;  In the U.S., Eicon sells through graphic arts and electronicsdistributors.andM;Futures.andP;  Eicon is about to release a MicroChannel version of the LPA card.andO;It is also about to release an updated version of its software; we were toldthat the new release will improve some cosmetic aspects of the product.andP;  Forexample, it will now blink the lights on the LaserJet while it is working.andM;Eicon is also preparing an interactive PostScript screen preview, calledESView, for the Microsoft Windows environment.andP;  You will be able to feed itPostScript commands and see the results immediately.andP;  The price has not beenfinalized, but we would look for something in the $200 range.andM;We were also told that the next release of Corel Draw will take fulladvantage of Eicon's ability to print in the background.andP;  Corel will be ableto print to disk, then automatically issue a PostScript run command to theEicon board, giving the file name as a parameter.andP;  The Eicon board will dothe rest, while Corel is immediately freed up for further drawing.andM;RIPS Image 4000andM;Our overall impression of the RIPS controller board is that it is reasonablyfast, is easy to use and prints good graphics.andP;  The type quality is not asgood as that of some other boards, however.andM;Hardware.andP;  RIPS currently uses the Weitek chip set with 3 MB of memory forits computing platform, as does Qume.andP;  Unlike Qume, RIPS uses its ownPostScript software, not the Weitek HyperScript implementation.andM;Installation is straightforward; the installation program instructs you onhow to set the option switches.andP;  We did notice one glitch: the manualpromised us that the program would automatically update our AUTOEXEC.BATfile, but it didn't.andP;  We had to scratch around a bit to figure out whatshould be happening.andP;  Fortunately, the logical thing to try was also theright thing.andM;Really, the only problem is that both circuit boards of the controller havethe chips facing inward, making us wary of a short to an adjacent board onone side or the other.andP;  The company says that, to its knowledge, no customerhas ever had a short; PC cards are necessarily manufactured to exactingspecs.andP;  If you are nervous, we can only suggest leaving an empty slot oneither side or sliding in a plastic slipsheet after the boards are in place.andM;Bootup.andP;  The initial software loading and setup time for the board is about32 seconds.andP;  No test page is printed.andP;  Once loaded, the board retains itsdata until you power down; you don't need to reload it every time you resetthe computer.andP;  However, if you put the startup command in your AUTOEXEC file,it will take the same 32 seconds every time.andP;  We don't view this as a seriousproblem.andM;In use.andP;  The board presents itself to the world as an LPT device.andP;  WE had nodifficulty printing from any of our test application programs.andM;The Image 4000 does not give any indication (such as blinking lights) to tellyou it is running.andP;  On a long job, you just have to take it on faith that theprogram hasn't crashed.andM;This is the only PostScript board we tested that offers Epson LQ andHewlett-Packard PCL (LaserJet) emulations.andP;  We cannot think of a good reasonto use a LaserJet emulation when driving a LaserJet (you could simply addressthe printer directly), but the feature makes some sense for other markingengines.andP;  PCL is supported by nearly all PC applications, including many thatdon't output PostScript.andM;Fonts.andP;  RIPS furnishes 35 Bitstream fonts with the Image 4000 and the RIPSPDL software.andP;  Interestingly, the manual makes no reference to downloadingother fonts.andP;  It turns out that you can simply copy the font outlines to theLPT port that the 4000 is using; the fonts will then stay resident until youreload the PostScript software.andM;Drives: Canon CX, SX (e.g., HP LaserJet and LaserJet Series II) engines andthe Canon LBP-20, a 20-page-per-minute 11&quot; x 17&quot; printer that offers duplexprinting.andP;  Also drives Ricoh 15-, 8- and 6-ppm engines.andP;  Fujitsu makes a17-ppm machine that RIPS has interfaced to in the lab, but RIPS has notsigned up any OEM marketing partner to sell a product based on it.andM;Futures.andP;  As we discuss elsewhere in this issue, RIPS will shortly change thenature of its Image 4000 product.andP;  First, it will move from the Weitek chipset over to Intel's 80960 processor.andP;  Second, the new design puts all thesoftware into ROMs rather than downloading the software at bootup time.andM;Even more interesting, RIPS has demonstrated that its newest software canread Adobe's encrypted Type I fonts.andP;  This opens up a very interestingcompetitive situation, provided that legal difficulties don't arise.andO;(Adobe's official posture is that its fonts are only licensed for use onAdobe contollers.)andP;  RIPS apparently has a technological advantage over otherclones here.andM;The Pure-Software ApproachandM;A raster image processor, if you look under the hood, really is nothing morethan a general-purpose microcomputer (perhaps a member of the 68000 family,but an Intel chip could be made to do the job if you worked at it) ith alarge amount of memory.andP;  A few additional chips are neededto interface theRIP to the marking engine and to the outside world.andM;The rest of the RIP is software: routines to recognize the command words ofthe page description language, to keep track of the graphics states of thepage during various phases of page construction, and to calculate theboundaries of objects and fill their interiors.andP;  Underlying everything islots and lots of computation: multiplication and addition of floating-pointnumbers.andM;It's pretty obvious that a PC has the ability to do lots ofcomputations--isn't that what a spreadsheet is all about?andP;  So a number ofvendors have decided to market the software of a RIP without the hardware;the customer furnishes the hardware in the form of his PC.andM;Tradeoffs.andP;  The tradeoffs are pretty clear.andP;  The software RIPs are pricedmuch lower than the plug-in cards, to say nothing of the standalone printers.andO;Because they aim at a price-sensitive market, they drive low-cost markingengines like dot-matrix and ink-jet printers, as well as the popular Canonand Ricoh laser printers.andP;  Upgrades and bug-fixes are easily distributed andthus likelier to be offered.andM;But they print much slower than the plug-in cards and standalone printers,taking four to eight times as long to get a document out.andP;  And they mayrequire you to upgrade your PC with a math chip and extra memory.andP;  Unless youalready have these things, or can justify buying them for other tasks, theyare a hidden cost that can negate the price advantage rather quickly.andM;Results.andP;  The other question is, do they work?andP;  We looked at two of theproducts on the market: LaserGo's GoScript and Custom Applications Inc.'sFreedom of Press.andP;  In general, we consider the quality of output in the sameleague as what you can expect from plug-in cards.andP;  In other words, theseproducts are for real; image quality has not been sacrificed to obtain a lowprice.andM;That's not to say that you will always get top-quality type.andP;  Just as thereare differences among printers and cards, there are differences among thesoftware RIPs.andP;  Interestingly, we thought that the $195 GoScript producedbetter type than the $495 Freedom of Press.andM;CAI Freedom of PressandM;This RIP handles more different kinds of printers than any of the others.andP;  Inaddition, it will shortly be able to handle color (see below).andP;  But afterlooking over the output samples, we feel that the current version of Freedomof Press comes off a distinct second-best when compared with GoScript.andP;  It'smore expensive, and we think the type quality is a bit lower.andM;In addition, this was the only interpreter in our series that failed to printall of our test files.andP;  It gave neither output nor an error message when itwas given the &quot;Star Lines&quot; file from the PostScript cookbook, which testsclipping an image to a path.andM;Hardware.andP;  Freedom of Press requires a half-megabyte or more of EMS memory.andO;If there is a math chip in your computer, it will use it, but it can runwithout one.andM;Bootup.andP;  No special actions are needed at bootup (aside from initializingyour EMS management software), though you will probably want to add theFREEDOM directory to your search path.andM;In use.andP;  Freedom of Press does not exist until it is loaded into main memory,so it presents no DOS interface to your application programs.andP;  You must printto disk, exist the application, then invoke Freedom from the DOS commandline.andP;  You can print several files from a single command.andM;There are numerous Unix-like command-line switches to set program options;you will need both the manual and the README file from the CAI distributiondisk to figure all the options out.andM;However, the distribution disk includes several batch files that will makethe task easier.andP;  One routine prints all the files in a particular directorythat have a particular file type, then automatically erases them.andP;  Thiscleans the directory for further use.andM;The program blinds the LaserJet's lights while it is running, a nice touch.andM;Fonts.andP;  The version we tested uses Compugraphic Intellifonts for itscomplement of 35 standard fonts.andP;  (CAI offers OEM products that optionallyuse either CG or Bitstream fonts.)andP;  Downloading additional third-party fontsamounts to putting each font name on the command line, as though it were justanother printable file, before the names of the print files to be output.andO;(PostScript fonts are, after all, just collections of PostScript pathdefinitions.andP;  But instead of printing something, the result of interpreting afont is to put the definitions into memory.)andP;  The fonts remain until theinterpreter is reinitialized at the beginning of the next job.andM;Drives: AVR Megabuffer, Blaser Star 2, Canon BJ130, Canon LBPs, Epson LQMFujitsu DL, Fujitsu Laser, HP DeskJet, HP LaserJets (and PCL-speakingclones), IBM X24, the JLaser card (and hence any printer the JLasersupports), NEC P5, Olivetti PG108, PCPI LaserImage, Siemens PT885-32 andPT90-12, Talaris 1590, Tandy DMP.andM;Futures.andP;  CAI has recently announced the release of version 2.0.andP;  We did notget a copy in time for our tests.andP;  However, we have seen it demonstrated.andO;The new release is claimed to run 50% to 300% faster than version 1.andP;  It alsofixes a number of bugs, including the memory management problem that causedour clipping-path test to fail.andM;Even more interesting, version 2 will support color PostScript commands oncolor dot-matrix and ink-jet printers.andP;  It drives the HP PaintJet and HowtekPixelMaster, along with several 24-pin dot-matrix devices using multicolorribbons.andM;LaserGo GoScriptandM;LaserGo sells the lowest-priced PostScript interpreter we have seen.andP;  It isnot, however, cheap junk; far from it.andP;  GoScript is an effective product thatproduces good quality output.andM;Hardware.andP;  GoScript does not need extra hardware.andP;  It works even if you don'thave a math chip or EMS memory.andP;  The floating-point math is done by thecentral processor with  subroutines that emulate the functions of a mathchip.andP;  It uses a disk file to hold the page bitmap buffer; for a full page at300 dpi, it initializes a 1,008-KB workspace on the disk.andM;If your computer has the chip and the memory, GoScript will run much faster.andO;Here's how the program performs with and without the extra hardware (see TimeTests on page 20 for specifications).andM;The math chip can be added to your PC independently of the EMS memory.andO;GoScript uses high memory for the page buffer, so unless you add enough tohold the whole bitmap, you won't get any benefit.andP;  The amount you needdepends on the resolution of your device; for a 150-dpi printer, you can getby with about 1/4 megabyte, while at 300 dpi you need a full megabyte.andM;You can disable the interpreter's use of these resources if you want to bymodifying a line in GoScript's configuration file.andP;  We're not sure why youwould ever want to disable the math chip, but you might want to keep GoScriptaway from your EMS memory if you have Ventura Professional Extension and wantto keep the hypenation dictionary loaded.andM;Bootup.andP;  The only change to your normal startup file is that you must add acommand to set an environment variable.andP;  You will probably also want to addthe GoScript directory to your search path.andM;Each time you run, GoScript must load its code and initialize its workspace.andO;If you want to download fonts (for an application that doesn't download aspart of the printing process), you must do so each time you run the program,entering the font names as part of the command line.andM;In use.andP;  GoScript interprets PostScript files from your PC's disk, so yourapplication must send its output to a disk file.andP;  When you are ready toprint, you must quit the application.andP;  You then invoke GoScript by typing itsname along with the list of files you want printed.andP;  Up to six files can beentered for a single print run.andP;  The files will be executed, one after theother, with no loss of time for reinitialization.andM;This is the mechanism for downloading fonts, as well.andP;  A font, after all, isnothing but a file containing a series of PostScript commands.andO;Theoretically, you can call for five fonts, since you can list six files onthe command line.andP;  However, there isn't room in memory for that many fonts;one or two is the practical limit.andP;  The flip side of stacking up files on thecommand line is that, since the graphic state of the interpreter is notreinitialized between files, errors can be passed from job to job.andP;  This isusually not a problem with commercial applications, but if there are bugs inthe way a program cleans up after itself, they will show up on the followingfiles.andM;Fonts.andP;  GoScript uses URW fonts and comes with the basic 35.andP;  LaserGo haspurchased rights to the entire URW library (over 2,000 fonts, including manynon-Roman alphabets), and we expect that it will begin making them availableas add-on products for GoScript.andM;Drives: HP LaserJet Plus (150 dpi), HP LaserJet Series II andits clones (150dpi or 300 dpi if you have 1.25 MB in the printer), HP DeskJet (150 or 300dpi), HP PaintJet (180 dpi, single selectable color), Canon LBP-8 Mark II(150 or 300 dpi if you have 1 MB of extra memory in the printer), CanonBubbleJet BJ-130 (180 or 360 dpi), IBM ProPrinter (120 x 72 dpi or 240 x 216dpi), Expson FX series (120 x 72 dpi or 240 x 216 dpi), Epson LQ series (180dpi or 360 x 180 dpi), NEC Pinwriter (180 or 360 dpi) and Toshiba 24-pinprinters (180 dpi, 360 dpi in some models).andM;Futures.andP;  LaserGo will bring out its new release of software later in thespring, we were told.andP;  Like the CAI product, it will support color printers.andM;ConclusionandM;In the course of our testing, it became clear that many of the clones on themarket are very acceptable devices.andP;  They offer a range of performance,prices and advantages beyond what the Adobe licensees have to offer.andP;  Theirpresence enforces a lively competition among all vendors, spurring everybodyto improve performance and reduce cost.andM;Standalone printers.andP;  We are delighted with both the Apple LaserWriter II NTXand Qume's CrystalPrint Publisher, but for different reasons.andP;  The NTX has ahard disk for font storage, and we have loaded a hefty library of faces ontoit.andP;  We think every printer should have at least the option to add a fontdisk.andP;  We only wish the machine were easier to reconfigure.andP;  Switchingbetween LocalTalk and the PC world is a real aerobic exercise.andM;We value the Qume for its compact footprint and relative portability.andO;Enhancing the portability is the fact that it has all the common computerinterface ports, including LocalTalk and Centronics.andP;  (OK, it lacks GPIB; butit has everything else used in the microcomputer world.)andP;  It is also fast andpriced comparatively low.andP;  Alas, its convoluted paper path makes it a poorchoice for printing overhead transparencies, labels, or envelopes.andP;  Nor doesit have a single-sheet feeder.andM;PC cards.andP;  Of the three cards, each has something to recommend it.andP;  We likethe Eicon card best of all for its convenient background processing andfont-fetching ability.andP;  Destiny carries the lowest price tag, while RIPS runsthe fastest.andM;There are many more cards we could have tested.andP;  For example, Hanzon offersthe Bauer PDL version of PostScript on its product.andP;  We certainly don't wantto imply that the three products we tested are better or worse than those wedidn't.andP;   Rather, these three represent a cross-section of the market.andM;Software.andP;  These products present the clearest tradeoff between speed andprice we have yet seen.andP;  We also appreciate the fact that they are moving tooffer low-priced color support.andP;  This will be important for presentations,point-of-sale displays and publication design work.andP;  Of the two products wetried, we liked LaserGo's GoScript better than CAI's Freedom of Press.andO;However, each firm is busy on upgrading its functionality.andP;  It will beinteresting to see how far the pure-software approach can be pushed.andM;The challenge.andP;  Taken as a group, all of the products in our surveydemonstrate that the challenge Adobe threw down five years ago has been met.andO;Vigorous competition now rules the 300-dpi PostScript marketplace.andM;Speed is the most obvious challenge for PostScript implementers now, both at300 and 400 dpi and at typesetters resolutions.andP;  As the font market develops,the arena will shift to transparency of font access and compatibility withdata formats from different font vendors.andP;  There's still plenty of room forproduct improvement and differentiation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
