Barry Goldwater accused JohnTower's Senate critics of hypocrisy Thursday, claiming ``there'd beno government'' if everyone guilty of drinking or womanizing was runout of town.   ``People who live in glass houses should never throw rocks,'' thealways outspoken Goldwater told reporters after he met withPresident Bush and discussed the troubled Tower nomination.   ``There are some strange things going on down in that oldSenate,'' said the former Arizona senator, who retired in 1986 aftera career spanning more than three decades.   Goldwater, who served with Tower on the Armed Services Committeeand chaired the panel in 1985 and 1986, said that no one had yetcome forth with proof that Tower had ever been incapacitated withalcohol.   ``Yeah, he drank. I had a few with him,'' Goldwater said. ``Thathe chased a few women? Hearsay. I don't give a damn whether he didor not. But I don't like the Senate working on innuendo, on factsthat have never been proven.''   ``I've been around this town a long, long time. If they chasedevery man or woman out of this town who shacked up with somebodyelse, or gotten drunk, there'd be no government. So I think that theSenate better start looking at facts.''   The 1964 Republican presidential candidate voiced particulardispleasure with Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate ArmedServices Committee and a leading opponent of Tower's nomination.   ``I'm amazed at Sam Nunn. I'm one of those Republicans who hadbeen hoping he'd run for president. But to come out as he has,against Tower, and only on the basis of drinking, I can't believeit.''   ``I'm frankly shocked that they could allow partisan politicscreep into this thing,'' he added.   ``I would say there's a lot of hypocrisy in it,'' Goldwater said.   ``If they start investigating 100 members of that Senate asthey've investigated John Tower, you people are going to have aball,'' Goldwater told reporters outside the White House.</TEXT></DOC>
