At a time when morale on Wall Street has been hurt by slumping revenues and layoffs, Kidder said its plan is aimed at putting more money in executives' pockets during the year. Kidder is 80%-owned by General Electric Co.    Many executives at Kidder and other Wall Street firms currently receive as much as 90% of their annual compensation in year-end bonuses. Under the new plan, which begins next year, about 200 Kidder executives will receive about 50% of their annual compensation in salary.    Silas S. Cathcart, Kidder's chief executive officer, said the plan won't change the amount of money Kidder pays in compensation. &quot;We're not trying to save money on this. We're just trying to be equitable and fair to our people,&quot; he said.    The bonus system has often been arbitrary and the source of anxiety and turmoil at Kidder and other Wall Street firms. Several Kidder executives were upset by what they felt were unusually low 1987 bonuses. The firm now will begin setting bonus targets for each executive at the beginning of the year so bonuses won't be such a surprise.    Kidder also plans to enhance its pension plan and create more investment opportunities for its executives, Mr. Cathcart said. </TEXT></DOC>
