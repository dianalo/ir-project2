President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the Estonian legislature'sattempt to take charge of all matters but defense and foreign policyand to review all new Soviet laws was ``in deep contradiction withthe Constitution of the U.S.S.R. and must be rejected as mistaken,not having any legal force.''   Gorbachev's remarks, made to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet,were reported by the official Tass news agency. But a rare filmreport of the session led the evening television news programVremya, indicating its importance to the Soviet leadership.   The Kremlin's action, three days before the nation's parliamentvotes on a controversial rewrite of the national constitution, dealta blow to recent efforts in Estonia, two other Baltic republics, andother Soviet regions to loosen Moscow's grip on their affairs.   But Gorbachev, who convened the Presidium, acknowledged thatnational constitutional amendments that he has proposed have angeredEstonians and people in other republics by restricting rather thanexpanding local autonomy.   Meanwhile, in the capital cities of the two other Balticrepublics on Saturday, grassroots political organizations organizedprotests against the proposed constitutional amendments.   Tass reported that in Riga, Latvia, members of the People's Frontwaved the red-and-white flag of the formerly independent Latvianrepublic. They were protesting their legislature's failure Tuesdayto follow Estonia's path and challenge Moscow's authority.   In Lithuania, where legislators also backed away from a directchallenge to the Kremlin, protesters rallied to demand that thenational amendments be withdrawn, Tass said. It did not give details.   The Vremya report on the Presidium's action said, ``In connectionwith the non-correspondence with the Soviet Constitution of severalstatements and declarations adopted by the Estonian Supreme Sovieton Nov. 16, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.declared them invalid.''   A week ago, legislative commissions of the Supreme Soviet foundEstonia's constitutional amendment reserving the right to reviewSoviet law at odds with the constitution and passed itsrecommendation to the Supreme Soviet.   A day after Estonia took its action, Tass reported it would beconsidered by the Presidium and that Estonian officials would beinvited to attend the meeting.   Tass said the Presidium heard a commission report as well as fromEstonian President Arnold Rutel.   The Presidium ordered development of a system by which the Sovietof Nationalities, one of two chambers of the national SupremeSoviet, and a constitutional review committee would widen andprotect the rights of the 15 republics that make up the Soviet Union.   Baltic activists pushing for greater autonomy under the banner ofGorbachev's reforms say the constitutional amendments would takeaway some of their power rather than grant greater local control.   The Kremlin has expressed some willingness to compromise on theissue.   Gorbachev told the Presidium, ``As a result of democraticdiscussion of these documents, we have today drafts of laws whichsignificantly differ from published and presented for discussionearlier.''   ``I believe that those changes improve these drafts, and what ismost significant they express the mood of the dominant majority ofthe working people of the country,'' he said.   ``They include many corrections and exclude some points whichcaused anxiety and misunderstandings,'' he said.   Earlier this week, a legislative panel recommended that the newCouncil of People's Deputies to be created under the amendments notbe given power to throw out laws adopted by the republics.   On Thursday, the ruling Communist Party Politburo notedcomplaints that the bills could be ``substantially improved.''   Radio Moscow said the Presidium received about 200,000 lettersabout the project. It said most approved it but many offeredsuggested improvements.   ``As a result, many provisions have been improved,'' Radio Moscowsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
