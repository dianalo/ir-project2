In a perfect world, thatwould mean signing Ken Griffey Jr. to the first contract, hiring Tony La Russaas the manager and building a replica of Fenway Park.;    Those were theconsensus picks in a poll of the 26 major league general managers. Theexecutives were asked which current player other than their own they wouldbuild a franchise around, and they were asked to rate the best manager,general manager, ballpark and baseball city.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Special Section  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  G.M. DREAMS: SIGN GRIFFEY JR., PLAY AT FENWAYBOSSES VOTE LA RUSSA TOP MANAGER  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  BASEBALL '91Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO><TEXT>     As for favorite peer, Harry Dalton of Milwaukee edged Sandy Alderson of theA's and Al Rosen of the Giants. Boston was voted the best baseball city.;   Easily the most decisive choice was La Russa, who has managed the A's to threeconsecutive World Series appearances. He received 13 of votes and wasdescribed once as &quot;steely tough.&quot;;    &quot;That's a boiling cauldron ofdissension, and he keeps them together,&quot; said Andy MacPhail of Minnesota.;   Roland Hemond, now Baltimore's general manager, was in the Chicago White Soxfront office when La Russa managed there. &quot;I like to think I knew he'd be thisgood,&quot; Hemond said. &quot;Tony is a great student who forever and ever tries toimprove. He's a very strong critic of himself. He would point out to memistakes in the game where he let it slip by, and he would critique his gameand his procedure. He is so meticulous in preparation -- that's where his lawdegree helped.&quot;;    Griffey, a center fielder who hit .300 and won a GoldGlove for Seattle last season at the age of 20, received eight votes. He wasfollowed by Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin with six and Boston pitcherRoger Clemens with three.;    Because of tampering rules, the respondentsagreed to discuss the ideal &quot;start-up&quot; player under condition of anonymity. Afew still abstained, and Houston G.M. Bill Wood said there is &quot;no such player.He not only would have to be highly skilled in every way but also have a goodattitude and show leadership qualities.&quot;;    One general manager who disagreedwith Wood said of Griffey: &quot;He's a kid who's still a baby. There's no reasonat all, barring injuries, why he can't play for the next 15 years.&quot;;   Seattle General Manager Woody Woodward is so convinced of his star's future,he huffed: &quot;If I can't name Griffey, then I won't name anyone.&quot;;    Judgingfrom the votes, there is no clear paragon among the general managers. Eight ofthem received at least one vote, and none received more than four.;    &quot;It'sgetting as hard to keep up with us as it is with the players,&quot; one generalmanager mused.;    One who selected Rosen explained: &quot;He's direct, he analyzesplayers very well, he really knows an organization, and he knows what it takesto win. He's extremely competitive and not afraid to make a move.&quot;;    One whoselected Alderson explained: &quot;He's been able to do something that hasn't beendone since the '70s, and if the A's win a fourth (consecutive) pennant it willbe the first time since the '60s.&quot;;    There were nine votes for Fenway as theideal setting, four more than Wrigley Field. Royals Stadium in Kansas City,Mo., was the only vote-getter that has artificial turf.;    &quot;Fenway has anatmosphere and character about it,&quot; said Hank Peters of Cleveland. &quot;It's notnew.&quot;;  G.M.
