A grand jury Tuesday began hearing evidence against 36-year-oldJulio Gonzalez, charged with 87 murders in the blaze at the HappyLand Social Club in the Bronx. Police said he set the fire earlySunday after being snubbed by an ex-girlfriend who worked there.   ``We'll have a made case even if he backs out of theconfession,'' said Edward McCarthy, spokesman for the Bronxprosecutor's office.   Gonzalez was transferred Tuesday to a prison unit within thepsychiatric ward at Bellevue Hospital, where a fellow inmate saidhe raged for hours against his ex-girlfriend.   ``He is so emotionally distraught that tears keep coming down,''the inmate, Louis Cuascut, said in today's New York Post. ``Heseems very, very depressed.''   The Happy Land club had been ordered closed for fire and safetycode violations and the landlord was trying to evict the owner fornon-payment of rent.   The building that housed the illegal club was subleased to theclub's operator by a company co-owned by actress Kathleen Turner'shusband, Jay Weiss. He leased it from one of New York's biggestlandlords, Alex DiLorenzo III.   Turner said she was shocked by the fire but that her husbandwasn't to blame.   ``It's unfortunate that it was that building but the fact isthat you can even throw a firebomb into McDonald's and it wouldhave had the same result,'' Turner said outside her Manhattanapartment, the Post reported today.   The actress, starring in a Broadway revival of ``Cat on a HotTin Roof,'' said she was afraid that people would come to her homeseeking vengeance.   Turner also said Tuesday through her publicist, ``This is an actof a violent madman. It's a tragedy. It doesn't reflect on me or myhusband.''   Among those scheduled to testify against Gonzalez are hisex-girlfriend, Lydia Feliciano, a worker at the club; and the manwho sold Gonzalez the $1 worth of gasoline he allegedly used tostart the blaze.   ``And then we have the container that held the gasoline, hissneakers, which were soaked with gasoline,'' McCarthy said. ``Weeven cut up a hunk of the floor and brought it in to prove the burnpattern was caused by gasoline.''   District Attorney Robert Johnson said Gonzalez gave police avideotaped statement in which he admitted that he torched the HappyLand in a pique against Ms. Feliciano.   Besides Ms. Feliciano, four other people escaped the inferno.   Authorities had warned DiLorenzo that Happy Land was riddledwith violations, including an illegally added second floor, nosprinklers on the first floor, no second exit and no fire alarms,Building Commissioner Charles Smith Jr. said in today's New YorkTimes.   Normally the violations report would have been forwarded by theowner to the leaseholder, but Weiss' attorneys said they neverreceived a formal notice of the violations. They would not commenton whether they knew of them.   Weiss, through his lawyer Roger Boyle, said Tuesday that OnePeach Associates, a company he owns with Morris Jaffe, leased thebuilding in 1985 from DiLorenzo's Clarendon Place Corp.   One Peach two years later leased the club to its operator, EliasColon, for up to $1,950 a month. Boyle said that since last springthe company had been trying to evict Colon for not paying rent. Thecase was to have been heard in court today. Colon died in the fire.   One Peach also leased space to a second after-hours club, calledLa Salsa, around the corner from Happy Land, for $2,500 a month,the Daily News reported today.   Neighborhood residents said La Salsa, too, was packed withrevelers Saturday night. The club has one door and no windows.Because of fire code violations, it had been ordered to close inAugust 1988.   Because many of the fire victims were poor Honduran immigrants,10 airlines have offered to ship the remains free from Miami toHonduras, said Larry Mackler, a spokesman for the American RedCross. The Red Cross plans to fly next-of-kin back as well to makefuneral arrangements.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Donations to provide burials for the victims andcounseling for their families should be earmarked ``Bronxdisaster'' and sent to:   American Red Cross   P.O.
