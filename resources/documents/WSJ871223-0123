A $600 million legal fee would warm holiday spirits in the Jamail home, but it also would pose a dangerous can-you-top-this? challenge to Mr. Jamail's colleagues of the plaintiff bar. If a new burst of contingency-fee competition results, it can only cast the quality of U.S. justice into further disrepute.    Judges will deserve most of the blame. The trial judge in the Texaco case later admitted he probably had misapplied New York law. The next failure was in the U.S. Supreme Court. When the justices in April rejected Texaco's request for a lowered Texas bond, they mistakenly assumed that the firm would get its day in court. Justice Brennan, joined by Thurgood Marshall, wrote: &quot;While Texaco cannot, consistent with due process and equal protection, be arbitrarily denied the right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard on appeal, this right can be adequately vindicated even if Texaco were forced to file for bankruptcy.&quot;    Sure enough, the Texas requirement of a $10 billion-plus bond soon forced Texaco into Chapter 11, where proceedings quickly followed a course that submerged the promised right of appeal. Creditors didn't care who won the case so long as the firm remained solvent. Carl Icahn -- who had invested in both oil firms -- and a shareholder committee negotiated directly with Pennzoil.    Texaco's lawyers waited in vain for the Senate to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat, hoping to improve their chances for the required fourth vote to hear the appeal. Texaco still thinks it owes Pennzoil nothing or, if it did interfere with an agreement to buy Getty, at most $500 million.    Simon Rifkind, a former judge and now a partner in one of Pennzoil's law firms, denounced these columns in a speech in May at Yale. According to a text distributed by Pennzoil, Mr. Rifkind said, &quot;This media blitz would be less disturbing if there were some national interest in this private controversy.&quot;    He quoted one of our editorials that said, &quot;The biggest immediate threat to American business is the American legal system.&quot; Mr. Rifkind responded, &quot;Indeed, it is, if the law is to be practiced by Wall Street journalists instead of Yale-trained lawyers.&quot;    But even journalists are bright enough to know that the nation has a powerful interest in sensible and predictable common law. It matters to potential investors whether the courts recognize a difference between a binding contract and an agreement in principle, which is all Pennzoil had with the Getty Museum. It matters whether judges enforce securities law 10b-13 prohibiting a side deal during a tender offer, a rule that was ignored until the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a brief for Texaco. It matters whether judges give full faith and credit to the laws of other states. The rape of Texaco especially worries foreign investors, who have a hard enough time understanding U.S. courts when they work.    All this now matters most of all to Texans, who realize that the bad reputation of the state's courts retards industrial development. Gov. William Clements has attacked his own Supreme Court for failing to reconsider the trial verdict. He formed a select committee of lawyers to work on court reform -- and excluded any representatives of the plaintiff bar. Chief Justice John Hill is resigning from the Supreme Court to campaign for a plan to reduce the donations from lawyers to the judges they practice before.    Indeed, one issue among the many never resolved in the Texaco case was Mr. Jamail's major contribution to the first trial judge in Pennzoil v. Texaco, who refused to disqualify himself on the startling ground that &quot;mere bias or prejudice&quot; is not enough reason.    The outcome of the Texaco case, assuming that shareholders approve the settlement and Mr. Jamail gets his huge fee, can only sharpen the appetites of lawyers seeking deep pockets. The nation already has a tort-law crisis that legislators have done little to address. Corporations also long ago learned the merits of strategic use of the courts to immobilize competitors and attempt to alter the outcome of business deals. At the rate things are moving it becomes fairly easy to imagine a national economy where genuine economic activity becomes enmeshed in the webs spun by lawmakers, lawyers and judges.    Despite Justice Brennan's pledge, there will be no &quot;adequate vindication&quot; for Texaco. The Texas, federal and bankruptcy courts all failed to do justice. Lawyer Jamail is in line to collect a very large fee and Pennzoil gets a windfall. It is hard to find any other winners. </TEXT></DOC>
