Programs designed toaffect students directly are also encouraged. Programs designed for adultlearners in an elementary or secondary school environment are also eligible.The Commission continues to encourage proposals from non-traditional educationalorganizations and those concerned with ethnic and minority interests, peoplefor whom English is a second language, and other special interest organizationssuch as those concerned with the learning disabled and the physically handicapped.<T3>Available funds anticipated:</T3> Approximately $1.8 million per competition.<T3>Estimated range of awards:</T3> $3,000-$125,000.<T3>Estimated number of awards:</T3> 25-35.<T3>Project period:</T3> No longer than 24 months, beginning no later thanSeptember 1, 1991.<T3>Priority areas for funding:</T3> The Program Announcement and FinalRule governing the Bicentennial Educational Grant Program were publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 14, 1987. Specifically, the Commissionencourages proposals which focus on themes paralleling those of the Commission'sfive-year plan and the development of the three branches of government.In the fall competition of the 1990 Educational Grant Program, the Commission'sfocus is on the Judiciary and its historical development in the 200 yearssince the first session of the Supreme Court and, for those projects tobe implemented during the 1990-1991 school year, the Commission welcomesproposals which focus on the Bill of Rights and subsequent Amendments.The emphasis in the spring competition shifts to the Bill of Rights andsubsequent Amendments. The focus of any proposal, therefore should be dictatedto some extent by when the project will go into effect.Limited funding is available for expanding, replicating, or continuinghighly successful educational programs which effectively link the Constitutionto civic literacy and responsibility today. A significant aspect of anysuch program would be the inclusion of a co-curricular activity and/orcommunity involvement component. The Commission encourages applicationsfor funding these exemplary projects from schools, school districts, ororganizations. A well-developed dissemination plan should be included inany proposal for funding under this initiative.<T3>Selection criteria</T3>: The Commission has developed the followingcriteria as general guidelines for judging all project proposals:1. The project is designed to strengthen teachers' capacity to understandand teach the Constitution, its antecedents, provisions, structure, andhistory, while benefitting students in an academically sound way appropriatefor the age group toward which it is directed. (15 points)2. The project has potential to make effective and appropriate use of existingand proven curricular materials, including those made available throughCommission sponsorship and the Bicentennial Educational Grant Program.(5 points)3. The project is cost-effective in that expenditures are reasonable andappropriate for the scope of the project. (5 points)4. The project must demonstrate the potential for affecting a much wideraudience than the immediate project participants. (10 points)5. The project represents an improvement upon existing teaching methods.(5 points)6. Applications have the capacity to carry out the project as evidencedby:a. Academic and administrative qualifications of the project personnel;b. Quality of project design;c. Soundness of project management plan.
