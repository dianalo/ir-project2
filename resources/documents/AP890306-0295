U.S. government officials have said Japan has failed to live upto a commitment to increase the percentage of the Japanese chipmarket held by American companies, while Japanese officials say theymade no such commitment. Former Commerce Department official ClydePrestowitz alleged last year in his book, ``Trading Places: HowAmerica Allowed Japan to Take the Lead,'' that the Japanesegovernment pledged in a secret document to raise the U.S. marketshare of semiconductors in Japan to 20 percent by 1991.   In the third quarter of last year, the latest period for whichthere are statistics, foreign manufacturers had 10.9 percent ofJapan's chip market, the MITI official said in an interview. TheU.S. Commerce Department says the American share rose from 9.2percent in 1987 to 9.5 percent in 1988.   In a 1986 semiconductor agreement, Japan pledged not to dumpcomputer chips _ selling them at less than fair market value _ inthe United States, and to increase American access to Japan's chipmarket.   Prestowitz wrote that there was a confidenial side letter inwhich ``the Japanese said that they understood, welcomed and wouldmake efforts to assist the U.S. companies in reaching their goal ofa 20 percent market share within five years.   ``The U.S. negotiators said that this commitment meant therewould be a guaranteed increase in the U.S. share of the Japanesemarket,'' Prestowitz added.   Japanese officials will not confirm the existence of a separatedocument accompanying the semiconductor agreement, but say there wasno document that holds them to increasing U.S. market share.   ``In a sense he (Prestowitz) is wrong because there are nolegally binding documents. In fact, U.S. government statements neveradmitted to the existence of such a document,'' the MITI officialsaid.   ``In general there are a lot of letters of exchange between theU.S. and Japan in any kind of trade negotiations,'' he said.``Sometimes they're secret and sometimes they're not.''   Asked if there was an informal agreement by the Japanesegovernment on a 20 percent share for U.S. chip manufacturers, theofficial said, ``No comment.''   But he added, ``Imagine if there was such a letter. It wouldn'trepresent a commitment to a market share.''   A U.S. government official who spoke on condition of anonymityrepeated Monday the American position that Japan is failing to liveup to an agreement to ensure a steady increase in U.S. market sharein Japan.   In April 1987, Washington imposed penalty tariffs of $300 millionagainst Japanese electronics imports, saying Japan still was dumpingchips worldwide and had failed to live up to its market accesspledge.   Washington reduced the penalties to $165 million two monthslater, saying Japan had stopped dumping but that the access questionremained.   Japanese manufacturers accounted for 50 percent of semiconductorssold in the world last year, up from 48 percent in 1987, while theAmerican global share fell from 39 percent to 37 percent, accordingto a U.S. survey.</TEXT></DOC>
