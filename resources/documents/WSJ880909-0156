Net was $3 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with $7.6 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales for the period, ended July 31, were $47.6 million, off from $60 million.    Franz von Ziegesar, chairman and chief executive officer, said that despite the earnings decline, which the financial printing company attributed to the environment in the financial markets since last October's market crash, the company was gaining market share. &quot;I am satisfied that our people are working better and more wisely than ever,&quot; he said.    For the nine-month period, net fell 54% to $9.1 million, or 50 cents a share, from $19.9 million, or $1.08 a share, a year earlier. Sales decreased 18% to $137.6 million from $167.2 million.
