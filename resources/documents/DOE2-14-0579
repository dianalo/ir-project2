Constitution:An acceleration head is erected to an armature at the top of a controlrod and a linear motor stater is attached above the magnet portion onthe side of a driving shaft. The stater is prepared by radially securinga plurality of laminated iron cores with slots being punched out in acomb-like manner and arranged axially to the shaft with the slots beingoutside and linear coils are wound around the slot each group with threesteps and they are connected so as to form a three phase cylindricallinear motor. Then, when magnetic fields formed by magnetic coils areinterrupted, impedance is reduced to increase the alternating currentto increase the super imposed alternating current. This is detected bya transducer, to actuate a relay, switcher, etc. to energize coils, bywhich travelling magnetic fields are generated and magnetic fluxes intersectthe head passing through iron cores disposed radially to cause eddy currentto the head. The head is pushed downwardly by the thrust caused thereby.(Yoshino, Y.).</TEXT></DOC>
