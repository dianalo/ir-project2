In the revision, PADER requested an extensionof the attainment date for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area to December 31,1987. EPA approved the extension on May 20, 1980 (45 FR 33607). PADER wasthen required to submit a SIP revision for the area by July 1, 1982, showingattainment of the ozone standard on or before December 31, 1987.On September 19, 1980, PADER submitted a new ozone SIP revision to EPAfor the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area. This revision demonstrated attainmentof the ozone standard for the area by 1982. EPA approved the revision onAugust 27, 1981 (46 FR 43140). Violations of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard continuedto be monitored for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre areas in 1982 and 1983. OnFebruary 22, 1984, the EPA notified the State, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H)of the Clean Air Act, that the ozone SIP for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barrearea was deficient and should be revised to demonstrate attainment of theozone standard. This SIP call pertained to Lackawanna and Luzerne counties.In response to the notification, PADER submitted a SIP revision of EPAreview of April 29, 1985. On September 11, 1985, EPA notified PADER that a two-part contingency planshould be submitted to EPA before the SIP revision could be given finalapproval. A notice of proposed approval was published on November 15, 1985(50 FR 47235), with the contingency plan mentioned as a condition for finalapproval. On September 25, 1985, PADER responded that the contingency plan was unnecessary,as the area was now in attainment. EPA then agreed to withdraw the SIPcall in connection with the redesignation action if EPA ultimately decidedto redesignate the area to attainment. Following finalization of the redesignation,the State would be be free to withdraw its April 29, 1985 SIP revision.PADER submitted a form request for the redesignation of Lackawanna andLuzerne counties to the EPA on January 13, 1987. The request also askedfor the redesignation of the adjacent, unmonitored Susquehanna, Wayne,Wyoming and Pike counties.Under section 107 of the Clean Air Act, states may request redesignationfor areas designated nonattainment for ozone when certain criteria havebeen met. The most important of these is compliance with the National AmbientAir Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone, which is defined for both the primaryand secondary standard in 40 CFR Part 50 as 0.12 parts per million (ppm)over a one-hour avaraging period. An area is in violation of the NAAQSfor ozone if a monitor's data contained more than three expected exceedancesof the standard over a three-year period.In addition to meeting the NAAQS, the State must be implementing the controlmeasures in the SIP for the area in question in order for EPA to approvea redesignation to attainment. Furthermore, the improvement in air qualitymust be permanent; for example, it cannot be merely due to an economicdownturn as this could result in only a temporary reduction in ozone. Also,any industrial shutdowns credited toward attainment must be permanent.These criteria are discussed in an April 21, 1983 policy memorandum fromSheldon Meyers, Director, EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards;December 23, 1983 and June 2, 1986 Policy memoranda from G. T. Helms, Chief,EPA's Operations Branch; and an April 6, 1987 policy memorandum from GeraldA. Emison, Director, EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards.Included with PADER's redesignation request were data from 1984-1986 showingno exceedances at any monitoring sites during that period. These data havebeen verified by EPA and satisfy the redesignation criteria. Additionally,EPA has determined that Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties have not experiencedany major shutdowns or an economic downturn. Further, PADER has implementedall the FOC control measures in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre portion of thePennsylvania SIP.These measures provide for permanent, enforceable reductionsin ozone emissions.Based on this information, EPA finds the redesignation request for Lackawannaand Luzerne Counties approvable at this time. Consequently, EPA proposesto withdraw the February 22, 1984 SIP call for Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties.Final action withdrawing the SIP call will appear in the final rulemakingnotice.In order to evaluate a redesignation request for an unmonitored area, EPAconsiders its proximity to major precursor source areas, and the prevailingwind directions. Rural, unmonitored areas can be redesignated to attainmentif they are adjacent to monitored attainment areas and if they are notdownwind from a nonattainment area with significant ozone-precursor sources.Data from areawide ozone-precursor studies in the vicinities of major urbanareas, such as St. Louis and Philadelphia, as well as data from rural monitoringsites in Region III, indicate that ozone transport can occur over considerabledistances downwind from major source areas. Based on these studies anddata, unmonitored rural areas are considered to be nonttainment if theyare located nearby and downwind from a designated nonattainment sourcearea.Wyoming, Susquehanna and Wayne Counties do not lie directly downwind ofthe monitored nonattainment areas in their Air Quality Control Region (AQCR).All three counties border on the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area, which is nowmonitoring attainment for ozone, and the Pennsylvania SIP is fully implementedin each county. These three counties therefore qualify for redesignation.The fourth unmonitored area mentioned in the redesignation request, PikeCounty, both is downwind from Lehigh and Northampton Counties, monitorednonattainment areas in the AQCR, and does not border any monitored attainmentarea. Pike County therefore does not fullfill the redesignation criteriafor rural unmonitored areas.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>The EPA proposes to approve the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's requestto redesignate Lackawanna, Luzerne, Wyoming, Wayne and Susquehanna Countiesto attainment for ozone. In addition, the EPA proposed to disapprove theredesignation of Pike County at this time. EPA is also giving notice thatit intends to withdraw the SIP call if the redesignation is fully approved.Interested parties are encouraged to submit comments on this proposed action.EPA will consider comments received within 30 days of publication of thisnotice.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator has certified that redesignationsdo not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.The disapproval portion of this action will not have a significant impacton a substantial number of small entities. The disapproval will simplymaintain the current nonattainment status of Pike County, and will notresult in any additional burdens on small entities.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 81</ITAG>Air pollution control, National parks, Wilderness areas.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: November 2, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Stanley L.
