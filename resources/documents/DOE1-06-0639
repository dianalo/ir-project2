Gas cooling equipmentavailable or under development include natural gas chillers, engine-drivenchillers, and absorption chillers. In cogeneration systems, heat recoveredfrom an engine's exhaust and coolant may be used in an absorption chillerto provide air-conditioning. Gas desiccant cooling systems may be usedin buildings and businesses that are sensitive to high humidity levels.</TEXT></DOC>
