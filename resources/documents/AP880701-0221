Most of them returned to West Berlin later in the day. Policesaid nine protesters were arrested, but eight were released later.   Authorities issued a removal order Friday after a 5-weekstruggle that pitted environmentalists against city developers. Thedemonstrators were protesting plans to build a highway through anearby park.   When more than 900 West Berlin police moved in to chase away thesquatters, the protesters were already perched on the wall.   They had earlier declared they would seek ``political asylum''in East Berlin if West German police tried to remove them.   East German border guards helped the protesters over thecommunist-built barrier, which splits Berlin into Allied andcommunist sectors. Some guards backed trucks up to the eastern sideof the wall to make it easier for the environmentalists to jumpdown and escape West Berlin police.   One smiling East German guard helped one protester by pullinghis bicycle over the wall. Others greeted cheering protesters withcoffee, warm sausages and cigarettes.   The protesters were occupying a 10-acre piece of land whichformally came under West Berlin's control at one minute afterThursday midnight. Before then, police could not legally enter thearea.   The property was handed over under a deal worked out with EastBerlin this year.   The protesters began occupying the land May 26. They set up ashantytown and put up barriers to protect themselves from police.   The area became the scene of frequent violent skirmishes betweenpolice and demonstrators. Protesters often attacked police withbottles, stones and gasoline bombs. Officers responded with teargas and water cannons.   West Berlin officials have repeatedly asked protesters to leavethe area, saying it could contain live ammunition from World WarII. The area, not far from where Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's bunkerwas located, was the scene of fierce battles in the final days ofWorld War II.   Officials have said plans for the proposed highway are not yetfinalized and have charged that many of the protesters are intentonly on provoking violence with authorities.   East Germany's state-run newspaper Neues Deutschland last weekreported West Berlin police were using ``terror tactics'' againstthe protesters, indicating offical Communist approval of theenvironmentalists' actions.</TEXT></DOC>
