<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-67-0377 </DOCNO><TEXT>The quadrupole interaction at /sup 111/Cd probe nuclei in YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub3}O/sub 7-//sub x/ has been studied over the temperature range 30--1100K by the time-differential perturbed angular correlation technique. Thehighly asymmetric electric field gradient (EFG) with eta = 1 suggestsCu(1) site occupancy for the parent /sup 111/In atoms. The quadrupolarrelaxation is attributed to a time-dependent component of the EFG dueto the hopping motion of oxygen atoms. Activation energy for oxygen jumpsis estimated to be 14 +- 4 meV on the basis of the variation of the relaxationparameter {lambda} with temperature.</TEXT></DOC>
