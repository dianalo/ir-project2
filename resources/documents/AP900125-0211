The parliamentary session was due to last through Friday and todecide on sorely needed economic reforms, but was abruptly brokenoff Thursday night and will not resume until Feb. 8, the officialnews agency BTA said.   Speculation spread that divisions between party reformers andconservatives were deepening, five days before the party is to holda national congress that could cast out holdovers from the TodorZhivkov era.   Zhivkov is under arrest for abuse of office during 35 years inpower. He was ousted Nov. 10 in the reforms that washed overEastern Europe and was replaced by his former foreign minister,Petar Mladenov.   Mladenov, who took over as party chief and Bulgaria's president,has pledged to hold multiparty elections by May. But oppositiongroups now holding talks with the Communists on power-sharing and anew election law have charged that the Communists seek to keepcontrol in Bulgaria.   Usually well-informed sources said the policy-setting CentralCommittee would discuss Mladenov's keynote speech to the partycongress and documents to be voted on at the congress.   Although senior party ranks have been purged of Zhivkov's bestknown supporters, many orthodox Communists in the provinces kepttheir positions of power.   Conservative Communists were strongly in evidence at Thursday'ssession of the National Assembly, or parliament.   Construction Minister Petar Petrov vigorously defended himselfagainst demands for his resignation by a group of citizens in theecologically scarred northern town of Ruse.   He won support from a majority of deputies, including DefenseMinister Dobri Dzhurov, an influential figure said to have played akey role in Zhivkov's overthrow.   Dzhurov was loudly applauded as he urged a halt to ``attacks onthe Communist party.''   BTA said said the legislature ``decided to let him keep his joband to sue his slanderers.''   ``Although indirectly, this gives satisfaction to many otherleaders at all levels around the country, who are not the targetsof invective,'' said BTA.   Bulgaria has also been hit the past week with labor stoppages.   BTA said the legislature asked for an end to all strikes untilJune, when the government plans to review salaries and revamp thesocial security system.</TEXT></DOC>
