An official statement, attributed to an unidentified governmentofficial and distributed by the state-run Saudi Press Agency,strongly defended the kingdom's growing military arsenal as afactor that ``would contribute to regional stability.''   The official said Saudi Arabia has acquired ``anintermediate-range surface-to-surface missile system from China''but gave no details about the cost or how many missiles areinvolved.   He stressed, however, that media reports that said the missileshad nuclear capability did ``not conform to the truth and thekingdom denies (them) fully.''   The Chinese deal was disclosed in Washington on Friday by theState Department and was said to involve CSS-2 missiles, similar tothose used in China's limited space program in the early 1970s.They are capable of being fitted with nuclear warheads.   The State Department said the missiles had a range of 2,200miles and could hit any area of the Middle East, including Israel.   It said the U.S. government was assured that nuclear warheadswould not be fitted on the missiles, but noted that the sale markeda ``disturbing regional trend.''   State Department spokesman Rudolph Boone said, ``Such a systemis not in the interests of peace and stability in the region.''   With Iran and Iraq engaged in a ``war of the cities,'' lobbingmissiles into each other's major population centers, theintroduction of more missiles in the region has raised concern inWashington, U.S. officials said.   Boone noted: ``The sum total of the proliferation is adegradation of the security of all states in the region.''   Secretary of State George P. Shultz expressed concern about thesales when he met Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian last week,State Department spokesman Charles Redman said.   Washington officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidSaudi Arabia sought the Chinese missiles after the U.S. Congressblocked the sale of 48 F-15 jet fighters to maintain Saudi airstrength.   Oil-rich Saudi Arabia has spent about $20 billion onsophisticated weaponry, mainly from the United States, over thelast 20 years.   France and Britain have moved in as prominent arms suppliers inrecent years because U.S. sales were blocked by a pro-Israel lobbyin Congress.   The missile deal was a suprise development for theocratic SaudiArabia which has so far refrained from having political ties withthe two communist powers, China and the Soviet Union.   Saudi Arabia has commercial ties with them, and has latelystepped up its political contacts with Beijing and Moscow in itsquest for international efforts to pressure Iran to agree to endits 7{-year-old war with Iraq.   Relations between Tehran and Riyadh plummeted last July afterhundreds of Moslem pilgrims, most of them Iranian, were killed inclashes in the holy city of Mecca.</TEXT></DOC>
