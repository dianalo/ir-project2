About 1,000 students clashed with police around Korea Universityin the worst street clash in Seoul since the Games began Sept. 17.   The protest marked the second straight day of demonstrationscalling for the release of student leader Oh Young-shik, arrestedby police last week.   Waves of students pelted police with rocks and firebombs,setting some troopers ablaze. Police tried to fend off the missileswith shields during the hour-long clash.   ``Down with the dictators' Olympics,'' and ``Yankee go home,''radicals yelled as they charged lines of riot police blocking thestreets with shields.   Police martial arts squads with long batons charged thestudents, beating and kicking some protesters. But police werepushed back several times by counter-attacking students.   Some police and students were injured by firebombs and rocks,but police had no casualty figures. There were no reports ofarrests.   The fighting was confined to the streets in front of the schoolin northeastern Seoul, about 15 miles from where the Games arebeing held. Students from other Seoul colleges took part.   Firemen called in by police tried to douse exploding firebombswith hoses, but students drove them off with more missiles.   Police were hampered in the fighting because of a government banon using tear gas during the Olympics to try and preserve peace.The police hurled stones and rocks, but had no effective way offighting back without tear gas.   Police tried to avoid a clash, staying in backstreets while thestudents blocked the main road and tore down part of the school'swalls. Students attacked with firebombs as soon as police moved in.   Radicals said they would disrupt the Olympics, including themens' marathon on Sunday, if police do not release Oh. The studentleader was charged Tuesday with violating national security lawsfor organizing anti-government demonstrations.   Authorities have beefed up security for Olympic events in caseof student demonstrations and say the radicals won't be able todisrupt any events.   Radical leaders released a statement charging the government ofpopularly elected President Roh Tae-woo is using the Olympics to``cement dictatorship.''   Students protesting against the government have stagedanti-Olympic protests to demand the Games be shared with communistNorth Korea and to denounce the Roh administration.   But just a handful of students have turned out for the mostlypeaceful protests. Most South Koreans want the Games to be a majorsuccess and are critical of the radicals.   North Korea is boycotting the Olympics because its demand toco-host the Games was rejected by the International OlympicCommittee. The committee said the Games are awarded to a singlecity and could not be shared.</TEXT></DOC>
