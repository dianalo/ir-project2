For those who lack the time or in-house technicalexpertise to perform the initial audit, write and evaluate equipmentspecifications, and coordinate with contractors, commissioning an EnergyServices Company (ESCo) can be the perfect solution. A pre-requisitefor maintaining or gaining the optimum level of cost and operationalcontrol is a firm understanding of where the building owner/manager standsversus where he wants to be in the future. The next step is to determinetarget goals for energy consumption reduction, operational efficiencyimprovement, and improvements that could have a favourable effect onenergy expenditures. Aside from commissioning an ESCo, there are variousways to finance an energy management program. As selection will be basedon the amount of financial risk to orgqnization is willing to take andthe types of cash flows desired. A straight purchase of the energy managementequipment and services is the simplest means, however, it could requirea large initial cash outlay if the scope of the work involved is substantial.When internal capital is scarce, an installment purchase or equipmentlease may better suit financial needs. On occasion, a building ownermay feel more comfortable commissioning an ESCo to handle energy managementfinancing. When selecting an ESCo, financial stability and ability toperform must be considered. Since financial risks are greater for thevendor, the buyer (owner/manager) and seller (ESCOo) may enter into acontract whereby a substantial precentage share of the savings is offeredto the vendor as an incentive to shoulder both the performance and financialrisks.</TEXT></DOC>
