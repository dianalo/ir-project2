The strike shut down the Trans-Ecuador pipeline, which connectsoil fields in the eastern jungle with Esmeraldas on the Pacificcoast 310 miles away.   Luis Roman, manager for the state oil corporation PetroEcuador,told a news conference if company technicians cannot reopenproduction in 48 hours PetroEcuador will seek help from state oilcompanies in Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil.   He reported that before the strike Ecuador was producing 290,000barrels of crude daily, more than twice its domestic daily needs.   The government put the entire country under a state of emergencyWednesday night and ordered the military to take charge of theaffected installations.   Strikers are demanding severance pay from Texaco, which is dueto turn over operation of the pipeline to PetroEcuador on Oct. 1.   Texaco officials refused to comment on the demand.   The Labor Ministry says severance should be paid by Texaco.PetroEcuador, which now has a minority share in the consortium madeup of the two companies, says it is not liable for severance pay.   The 170 workers who operate the pipeline, pumping stations andshiploading facilities for Texaco are demanding about $43 millionfrom the company before the turnover Oct. 1. Hundreds of Texacooffice workers in Quito walked out in support of the strikers.   Roman said PetroEcuador sent technical personnel Thursday to themain oil region of Lago Agrio, 120 miles east of Quito, to restartproduction after the military expelled strikers who had taken overfacilities.   He said the company was considering an emergency measure using apipeline that runs from Lago Agrio into neighboring Colombia. Itconnects with a Colombian pipeline at the jungle city of Oritos tocarry oil to Tumaco, Colombia, on the Pacific coast.   Roman said, ``The government has reacted swiftly and forcefully... since losses from the strike are surpassing $4 million a day.''   He said the country has 15 days of refined oil products andcrude oil reserves for another 15 days. Ecuador uses 120,000barrels of oil daily.   The state of emergency restricts civil rights and freedom ofmovement. In signing the decree, President Rodrigo Borja, a SocialDemocrat, said ``internal commotion'' threatened the nation's mostimportant source of income.   Ecuador, a member of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries, relies on oil for 60 percent of its export earnings. Itearned more than $1 billion in oil sales last year.</TEXT></DOC>
