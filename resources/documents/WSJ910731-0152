The executives -- whose disclosure had been expected --also said that they continue to see strong demand for themachines. They said at a news briefing that a customerordering a machine today wouldn't be promised delivery untilthe second quarter of next year.</LP><TEXT>   The executives said that deliveries would begin onschedule in September and that the delicate process ofbringing manufacturing operations up to speed was going well.   They cautioned, however, that the demand for mainframecomputing power would increase just 20% to 25% this year --as measured in millions of instructions per second -- belowmarket researchers' historic projections of 30% to 35%growth. Because prices typically fall 15% to 20% a year perunit of performance, and are under particular pressure thisyear, that growth in demand for horsepower should translateinto minimal growth in mainframe revenue at best. Theexecutives did say they expected demand to pick up next year,as IBM and its competitors shift into high gear in producingthe new machines.   Separately, IBM announced a series of &quot;voice-processing&quot;products that help integrate company's telephone systems withtheir computer systems. The software, which runs on IBMpersonal computers and workstations, could be used, forinstance, to let companies automate customer serviceoperations. An insurance company customer, say, could call anumber and, both by talking into the phone and by punching innumbers, request information on a claim. The system wouldretrieve that information from a central computer, and anelectronic voice would provide it to the caller.</TEXT></DOC>
