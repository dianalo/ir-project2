SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Army said Thursday that it had groundedits fleet of AH-64 ``Apache'' attack helicopters after a flaw wasdiscovered on two of the gunships during maintenance inspections.   The Army said in a statement released at the Pentagon that thegrounding of the 526 choppers, expected to last a few days, was aprecautionary measure because a cracked retention nut was found onthe two helicopters.   The Apache is the Army's newest and most sophisticatedhelicopter gunship.   Army spokesman Maj. Barry Bomier said no accidents had beenreported because of the problem, adding that it was the fourthgrounding of the entire Apache fleet.   The fleet, based throughout the United States and Europe, wasgrounded twice in 1986 and once earlier this year after an accidentin which a piece of sheet metal struck a gunship's rotor blade.   The grounding will remain in effect until an analysis of thepart is completed at the U.S. Army Aviation Systems Command in St.Louis, Mo. The analysis should result in information to identifythe proper procedure for maintenance crews to follow, Bomier said.   The part, known as the main rotor hub retention nut, holds therotor onto the shaft of the aircraft, Bomier said.   The co-pilot of an Army Nation Guard AH-64 was killed and thepilot seriously injured in a June 29 crash in northern Florida whenthe tail rotor came off the aircraft.   The Army said its investigation found that a piece of sheetmetal used to help secure a door had been improperly stored andthat the piece of metal became dislodged and flew into the AH-64'stail rotor system.   The choppers, built by McDonnell Douglas _ formerly HughesHelicopters _ cost about $13 million each.   The gunship was commissioned to replace the Cobra as the Army'sprimary attack helicopter. The twin-engined Apache, designed todestroy enemy tanks, carries Hellfire and Hydra 7 missiles and a30mm cannon.</TEXT></DOC>
