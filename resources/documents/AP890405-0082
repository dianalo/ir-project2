The church authorities returned the Rev. Anton Mowat to Englandfor treatment instead of reporting him to police, according to areport published Tuesday in the Atlanta Constitution.   Mowat fled a treatment center there and currently is a fugitive.   Mowat, who spent two years as associate pastor of Corpus ChristiCatholic Church in suburban Stone Mountain, was charged last yearwith molesting four boys, ages 12 to 14, during the 12-month periodending in October 1987.   The out-of-court civil settlement involves three of the fourboys.   The archdiocese agreed to pay $30,000 each to the three parentsor guardians, with a total of about $107,000 in other compensationplus $161,000 in attorneys fees going to two of the guardians,according to court documents.   The church also agreed to undisclosed ``deferred payments'' totwo of the victims after they reach the age of 18.   Parents reported the molestations to the archdiocese, assumingthe church would contact authorities.   Sent back to England, Mowat vanished from a Catholic centerwhere priests are treated for various psychological or behavioralproblems. Church officials in England reportedly were unaware ofthe indictment.   Robert R. Richardson, attorney for the victims, declined tocomment on the settlement.</TEXT></DOC>
