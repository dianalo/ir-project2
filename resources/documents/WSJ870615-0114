Terms weren't disclosed.    David R. Tacke, chairman and chief executive officer of the defense electronics contractor, said E-Systems sold the unit &quot;because its business is no longer compatible with our primary thrust in the field of defense electronics,&quot; except on a specialized basis. He said the sale won't have any material effect on E-Systems.    The unit is involved in aircraft-related maintenance and overhaul. </TEXT></DOC>
