The denial came a day after President Bush said transfers offorbidden technology are ``taboo'' and that ``it would not enhancerelations'' if Israel defied the United States to help South Africadevelop a nuclear-capable intermediate-range missile.   NBC News reported last week that Israel had provided Pretoriawith know-how from Israel's canceled Lavi jet plane program, whichwas financed by the United States.   Rabin was quoted by other Cabinet ministers as saying Israel didnot sell any U.S. technology or any technology developed with thehelp of American funds. The Cabinet also issued a separatestatement of denial.   Rabin, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister MosheArens met for an hour Sunday to discuss reports on Israeli-SouthAfrican military links and troubled relations with Washington,Israel radio said.   ``The defense establishment did not transfer from Israel to anyother country American technologies or systems that includeAmerican components without permission by the U.S. authorities,''the Cabinet statement said.   ``All allegations in the NBC report that the Lavi technologiesor American Lavi technologies were transferred allegedly to SouthAfrica, are baseless,'' said the statement, read to reporters byCabinet Secretary Elyakim Rubinstein.   Israel scrapped the Lavi project in the summer of 1987. Laterthat year, South Africa reportedly launched a campaign to attracthundreds of Israeli engineers who worked on the Lavi before losingtheir jobs. Some Israeli-developed technology for the plane isofficially for sale.   Shamir said the allegations were ``baseless lies'' and said theIsraeli public was united in its opposition to South Africa'sgovernment, which is led by the white minority and denies the blackmajority a voice in national affairs.   ``We have been the subject of such recriminations many times,and we explained many times to the American Congress and theAmerican administration that these all are baseless lies,'' he saidon Israel radio.   Israeli officials viewed the reports that Israel helped SouthAfrica build a long-range missile in exchange for supplies ofuranium as an attempt to pressure Shamir into accepting U.S.proposals for negotiations with Palestinians.   Baker, following a plan by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, hasproposed a framework for getting representatives of Israel and thePalestinians to the table to discuss Israeli-offered elections inthe occupied territories.</TEXT></DOC>
