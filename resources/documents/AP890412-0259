The amendment, passed 86-11, was one of more than a dozen up forconsideration today before a final vote on the minimum-wage bill,which calls for raising the hourly base wage from its current $3.35to $4.55 by October 1991.   The slow pace of the debate on amendments threatened to push thefinal vote back until Thursday.   Passage of the amendment offered by Sen. William L. Armstrong,R-Colo., also brought the Senate bill far out of line with aHouse-passed bill, meaning that after final Senate passage aconference committee would be needed to draft a compromise.   The current outside earnings limit is $8,880 for Social Securityrecipients 65 years of age or older. After crossing that limitrecipients lose $1 of benefits for every $2 in earned income.   The amendment would increase the limit for most of thoseaffected to $9,960. It would apply to Social Security recipientsbetween the ages of 65 and 70. The earnings limit expires after age70.   Most of the senators who spoke against the amendment said theysupported its goal but questioned the appropriateness of adding itto the minimum-wage bill. They also said that benefits to thousandsof Social Security recipients likely would have to be cut to payfor the proposal.   The amendment is not related to the mininum wage but Senaterules do not prohibit tacking on other proposals to legislationbeing considered by the full body.   An impasse between President Bush and the Democraticcongressional leadership that threatens prospects for a higherminimum wage has both sides trying to convince the public the otherside is to blame.   Bush has said he will veto the Democratic plan, a developmentthat could lead to a ninth consecutive year without an increase inthe minimum wage despite the first White House support this decadefor some boost.   Polls have shown the public overwhelmingly supports an increase,a fact not lost during the partisan wrangling.   ``This legislation will be a test of whether we indeed areseeking a kinder, gentler nation,'' Senate Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell said Tuesday, criticizing Bush for refusing to budge fromhis proposal, which would raise the minimum wage from $3.35 an hourto $4.25 an hour by January 1992.   Mitchell said Bush's ``kinder, gentler'' campaign rhetoric is atodds with his opposition to the Democratic bill, particularly whenthe president is backing expanded tax breaks for capital gainsenjoyed largely by the nation's wealthy.   ``How can anyone justify wanting to give $30,000-a-year tax cutsto the richest Americans and at the same time oppose 30 cents anhour more for the poorest Americans?'' said Mitchell, D-Maine.``That's not right. It's wrong. It's unfair.''   Mitchell spoke just before the Senate rejected Bush's proposal,58-41, largely along party lines, and instead amended a bill bySen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to bring it more in line with theHouse bill. That revision was approved, 61-39.   The administration fired back quickly, with Labor SecretaryElizabeth Dole raising the prospect that the partisan squabblingwould result in no increase in the minimum wage this year.   ``Democrats have no one to blame but themselves,'' Mrs. Dolesaid. ``The Democrats decided they'd rather fight than win.Unfortunately, the people who really lose are the ones who canleast afford it.''   In addition to favoring a smaller increase in the generalminimum wage, Bush has insisted on letting employers pay newworkers a sub-minimum ``training wage.'' Democrats, who longopposed a sub-minimum, agreed this year to include one in theirproposal in hopes of making it more acceptable to theadministration.   The Kennedy bill, as amended, contains a provision allowingemployers to pay new workers a sub-minimum wage for up to 60 days;Bush has insisted on a six-month training wage.   Republicans, however, are confident a veto can be upheld and arein no mood for a compromise on the overall dispute.   ``There isn't going to be a compromise,'' said Senate Republicanleader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``It's going to be $4.25 an hour and asix-month training wage, period.''</TEXT></DOC>
