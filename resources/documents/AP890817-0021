SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Pentagon says the cost of bringing its 98major weapons systems from the drawing board to full production isexpected to be $806.2 billion _ $19 billion less than thought sixmonths ago.   But that figure is sure to fluctuate since Congress already hasattempted to rearrange Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's firstspending plan.   The Pentagon issued a congressionally mandated report Wednesdaythat offers a ``snapshot'' of anticipated overall weapons costs ifthe Bush administration budget is followed.   Several of the weapons contained in the Selected AcquisitionReport entered development in 1970, while others are expected to bein production beyond the year 2000. As the weapons programs reachthe final stages of production, they are dropped from the report.   The previous report, which was released in March and estimatedcosts as of Dec. 31, 1988, predicted the overall cost of thePentagon's major weapons systems would be $825.9 billion.   The report said the $19 billion drop over the past six months wasdue primarily to Cheney's attempt to cancel the Marine'stroop-carrying V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor plane and halt production on anumber of items such as the Army's AH-64 Apache attack helicopter,the OH-58D helicopter, the Navy's F-14D jet fighter, the Air Force'sF-15E fighter plane and the PHOENIX air-to-air missile, which iscarried aboard F-14s.   Congress has attempted to restore the Osprey to the Pentagon'sspending plan for next year. Its cancellation would have sliced$23.4 billion from the Pentagon's budget, the report said.   The report also detailed estimated increases in several programs,such as the addition of 225 CH-53E troop transport helicopters forthe Navy and Marines, raising the total cost of that program from$4.8 billion to $7.8 billion.   Under Cheney's plan, the choppers were envisioned as thesubstitute for the V-22 Osprey.   The report said the Army's SADARM missile program jumped by $4.4billion to $6.2 billion, due primarily to orders from fiscal years1995 through 2002, which had not been recorded in previous reports.In total, the Army estimates it will purchase 124,145 of theanti-tank missiles.   An increase of $1 billion was logged for the Navy's SSN-21 SeaWolf submarine program, while research, development and testingdrove costs of the Air Force's small intercontinental ballisticmissile program up by $2.2 billion to $5.3 billion, the reportshowed.   The Pentagon is required by Congress to produce the annualSelected Acquisition Report.   It is a review of the total procurement costs of the majorweapons programs and is designed to provide a broad gauge of howwell the Pentagon is managing its weapons buying.   On Wednesday, officials released an update of that report, whichsummarizes programs that have had cost estimate changes of at least5 percent or schedule delays of at least six months.   The cost estimates include research and development for a weaponsprogram, its procurement and construction costs. The total programcosts reflect actual costs on delivered items, as well asanticipated costs for future procurement, which in some instances``extend beyond the year 2000,'' the Pentagon report said.   The report released Wednesday gave a view of the program costs asof June 30.</TEXT></DOC>
