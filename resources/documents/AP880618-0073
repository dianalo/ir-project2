The 14th annual meeting between the world's largest industrialcountries _ the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain,France, Italy and Canada _ was being held under the tightestsecurity ever seen in Canada's largest city.   A 3,000-member security force was deployed around theMetropolitan Toronto Convention Center where the government leaderswill begin meeting Sunday, protected by 15-foot-high chain linksecurity fences.   In his weekly radio address, broadcast from the Oval Office,President Reagan looked back to his first economic summit, also inCanada. He said there had been changes for the better in the worldeconomy in the intervening seven years.   ``We have led the world toward a remarkable consensus thateconomic freedom, not state planning and intervention, holds thekey to growth and development,'' Reagan said.   Reagan said the Toronto summit would be a chance to assure thatthis ``great venture to progress continues'' through doing more tosupport economic coordination among the major countries and byremoving remaining trade barriers.   This year's summit is expected to be a low-key gathering, inpart because President Reagan is a lame-duck with only seven monthsleft in office but also because the economy is doing surprisinglywell, especially in light of the fears of a global recession thatwere widespread immediately following the October stock marketcrash.   Growth in most of the major countries has accelerated this year,driving down unemployment rates to the lowest levels of this decade.   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who is hoping hisposition as the summit host will give him a political boost athome, said Saturday that it would be wrong to dismiss the summit asa do-nothing affair just because no major initiatives are expected.   ``The coordination and cooperation economically that emanatesfrom the summits is a very major contribution towards worldgrowth,'' Mulroney said during a visit to the rooms where thenearly 3,000 journalists from 50 countries were setting up shop.   ``What would we have done last October in the light of themarket meltdowns without the Group of Seven,'' Mulroney asked,referring to the seven summit nations. ``The G-7 was able to stepin and send signals of confidence to markets around the world.''   Reagan, who is attending his eighth and final economic summit,will be the last world leader to arrive on Sunday.   The president said Saturday that efforts to stop illegal drugtrafficking and rebuild the economies of Afghanistan and thePhilippines also would be on the agenda for the summit as would hisproposal, first made last year at the Venice summit, to end farmsubsidies by the end of the century.   But Reagan's farm proposal has drawn support from few of theother leaders, with Japan, West Germany and France raising some ofthe strongest objections.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned in a speech to theCanadian Parliament earlier in the week that leaders must not movetoo quickly on the farm question, and Jacques Delors, whorepresents the European Economic Community at the summit,complained that the U.S. position on farm subsidies threatened to``spoil the atmosphere'' of the talks.   In an interview Saturday, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker IIIacknowledged that the United States was facing intense oppositionon the farm question and any breakthrough would be``extraordinarily difficult.'' But he said the United States hopesat least to get commitment that the problem will be a prime topicfor discussion during the current round of trade liberalizationtalks.   Baker said the United States believed it had agreement goinginto the meetings for a final summit communique that would say the$150 billion major countries spend annually on farm subsidies wasthe ``foremost trade problem in the world'' and the countries hopedto make progress in solving the problem at a midterm review of thetrade talks to be held in Montreal in December.   ``We want to move the ball down the field a little bit, or atleast we don't want to be thrown for a loss,'' Baker said in aninterview on the Cable News Network show ``Evans andamp; Novak.''   A British official, who spoke on condition that his name not beused, said that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher did notthink the elimination of all subsidies by the year 2000 waspractical, but she did believe the level of subsidies needed to betrimmed.   ``Mrs. Thatcher is definitely pushing for action so as to assurefarm subsidy disarmament rather than farm subsidy armament,'' theofficial said.   Mrs. Thatcher, the leader with the longest tenure among thesummit leaders, arrived at mid-afternoon Saturday followed an hourlater by Italian Premier Ciriaco De Mita, who is attending hisfirst summit.   Mrs. Thatcher was made an honorary ``bencher,'' or senior lawyerof the Law Society of Upper Canada.   De Mita was taken immediately from the airport to anenthusiastic welcome in the Italian section of Toronto, a citywhich is home to 500,000 expatriate Italians and likes to boastthat it is the largest Italian community outside of Italy.   ``I have the feeling I never left Italy when I look aroundnow,'' De Mita said in Italian to a crowd which needed notranslation.</TEXT></DOC>
