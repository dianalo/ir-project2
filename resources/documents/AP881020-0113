(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The New York Power Authority shut down itsIndian Point 3 nuclear power plant early today when a small amountof radioactive water mixed with the water that turns the turbinegenerator.   There was no public health threat, the authority said in astatement. The radioactive gas released into the atmosphere wasless than 0.1 percent of the level permitted by the federalgovernment during normal plant operations.   Plant officials declared an ``unusual event,'' the lowest offour classifications for occurrences at nuclear power plants, at11:25 p.m. Wednesday, the release said.   Federal and local officials were notified and the gradualshutdown of the plant, in Westchester County north of New YorkCity, was completed early today.   A small perforation in a tube in one of the plant's four steamgenerators allowed water that is heated by the nuclear reactor _and which becomes radioactive _ to mix with water in a separatesystem that is meant to turn to steam from the heat and turn theturbine, the power authority said.   It was not immediately known how long the plant will have toremain shut down, said authority spokesman Carl Patrick.   ``It will depend on what the inspection shows and what repairsare necessary,'' he said.   Indian Point 3 had reopened Sunday after a one-week shutdowncaused by an unrelated problem, he said. Before that, it hadoperated for 116 days without a problem.</TEXT></DOC>
