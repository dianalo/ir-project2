Michael S.Dukakis.   ``The steps I'm announcing today will help guarantee that creditin the Commonwealth is color blind,'' he said.   The plan follows a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Bostondocumenting that race has been a factor in home mortgage lending inBoston. The report said lenders were ``functioning in a way thathurts black neighborhoods.''   ``The Federal Reserve Bank study should be the concern of everyfair-minded citizen of Massachusetts,'' Dukakis said.   The program's first steps will provide tougher evaluations ofstate-chartered banks in Boston and other urban areas on theircompliance with the federal Community Reinvestment Act. It also willlink Community Reinvestment Act performance to all bank applicationsrequiring the state Banking Division's approval.   Next week, Dukakis said, he will ask the Legislature to approveseveral proposals to strengthen the power of state regulators toassure there is no discrimination in mortgage lending.   The governor's proposals would require mandatory participation ina mortgage review board process by all lenders in the state andexpand the size and diversity of the four regional boards byincluding a member of the public. The program now is limited tolenders that voluntarily agree to participate.   The boards have the authority to review mortgages to make surethere is no geographic discrimination in lending practices.   The legislative package would also place mortgage companies,mortgage brokers and all parties making five or more mortgage loansa year under the specific licensing and examination powers of thedivision of banks.   Mortgage companies, a fast-growing segment of the financialservices industries, now are not regulated by the state. ConsumerAffairs Secretary Mary Ann Walsh has made their regulation apriority issue on her legislative agenda.   The Dukakis legislative package also would make communityreinvestment evaluations public records. Now the law requires themto be kept confidential.   In addition, Dukakis said, an interstate banking bill alreadypending in the Legislature would require out-of-state banks buyingin-state banks to make available assets to support affordablehousing programs.   Massachusetts now has a reciprocal agreement with other NewEngland states on interstate banking, but does not allow otherout-of-state banks to enter the state.   State Banking Commissioner Andrew J. Calamare said the measuresannounced Wednesday would enhance the ability of his division toassure the credit needs of low and moderate income people are met.   He said the division in the past 2{ years already has cited 14Boston state-chartered banks for inadequate performance.   According to the Banking Division, there are 42 state-charteredbanks in the Boston area, and a total of 294 in the state.</TEXT></DOC>
