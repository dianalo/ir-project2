Gorbachev, in a continuing drive for what he describes as a &quot;democratization&quot; of Soviet society, has proposed that Communist Party officials be elected by secret ballot and that more than one candidate be permitted to run for each office.    The proposed changes would be a sharp departure from established practice, which provides a single candidate for each party post who is ritually endorsed at party meetings by a unanimous show of hands.    Soviet experts say implementation of the proposals, assuming Mr. Gorbachev manages to overcome opposition to them, could be delayed until the convening of a party conference, a rare gathering of about 5,000 party officials, that he has called for next year. Because such a meeting hasn't been held since 1941, Soviet experts see this as evidence of the importance that Mr. Gorbachev attaches to the changes. The 1941 conference was called four months before the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union.    The Soviet leader appears to be gambling that opening up the traditionally closed Soviet political process would help counter widespread resistance to his program for economic modernization.    &quot;Gorbachev believes his reform program has strong popular appeal,&quot; said Jerry Hough, a prominent analyst of Soviet politics at Duke University. &quot;He's confident that opening up the political process a little will attract more people who support his ideas and not those of his conservative opponents.&quot;    Mr. Gorbachev's push for changes in electoral procedures in the Soviet Union's single-party political system came yesterday in his opening speech at a plenary session of the Communist Party Central Committee, which was convened to discuss &quot;personnel questions.&quot;    The Soviet leader had sought this plenum since last October but was unable to convene the meeting because of strong high-level opposition to his stated goals for the gathering.    When the plenum closes today or tomorrow, Soviet watchers say, the Soviet leader can be expected to announce the &quot;retirement&quot; of members of the ruling Politburo who are widely regarded as the rallying point for entrenched old-guard resistance to his modernization program. This would open slots that Mr. Gorbachev could then fill with officials who favor his policies.    Similar electoral experiments have been tried in Eastern European communist countries on a limited scale, and more recently, proposed in China.    Candidates for party posts from the Politburo down to the factory level are currently selected by the party leadership. Real political involvement is limited by the membership of only 10% of Soviet adults in the 18 million-member Communist Party.    Mr. Gorbachev specified that the new electoral procedures should apply to party first secretaries of the nation's 15 republics and of all the nation's regional, city and district party organizations. These officials make up the backbone of the Soviet political elite.    In a move that has stunned analysts, Mr. Gorbachev suggested that the new rules govern all levels in the party's hierarchical system, including &quot;the highest party organs in Moscow.&quot; Experts said Mr. Gorbachev was raising the possibility that both the ruling Politburo, which he as general secretary heads, and the powerful party secretariat, could also be elected in less restricted procedures.    &quot;It is necessary to seriously renovate personnel policy, rid it of deviations and shortcomings, and make it truly modern, more vigorous and purposeful,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev told the Central Committee, which comprises about 300 top party representatives.    In the state sector, which runs parallel to the party and in practice, if not in theory, is subordinate to it, Mr. Gorbachev suggested that more women, young people and citizens who are not members of the Communist Party should be elected to government office. Currently, only one-quarter of the deputies to the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament, are nonparty.    All candidates for the Supreme Soviet now are carefully vetted by party committees and only a single candidate for each position is provided on the ballot, creating what Soviet watchers sometimes refer to as a &quot;democratic fiction.&quot; Calling for &quot;more effective and real participation of voters in all stages of the pre-election and election campaigns,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev proposed that limit on the number of candidates be dropped.    &quot;These moves show Gorbachev is not intimidated by his opponents,&quot; says economist Marshall I. Goldman, associate director of Harvard University's Russian Research Center. &quot;In his view, broader political participation will mean more whistle blowers to attack the corruption and cronyism he says is blocking Soviet economic development.&quot;    In a move apparently aimed at applying public pressure on opponents of his proposals, which Mr. Gorbachev said had been drafted by the Politburo, the Soviet leader said his recommendations would be published for nationwide debate. </TEXT></DOC>
