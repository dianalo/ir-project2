Even more impressive than the sum of its individual accomplishments is a 27-year record for impartiality, diligence and accuracy that is so strong that polemics against the organization's work can often be dismissed out of hand.    It is Amnesty International's status as a simple force for good in the world that makes the ill-conceived and over-hyped venture the organization is currently embarked upon so hard to accept. As the &quot;Human Rights Now!&quot; tour wends its well-intentioned way from Philadelphia to Los Angeles, it may not be too late to ask just why Amnesty International is putting on rock concerts.    Jack Healey, the director of Amnesty International USA, and the man behind Concerts for Human Rights, says the purpose is to effect &quot;a renewal of dedication to human rights,&quot; in celebration of the 40th anniversary of the United Nations Universal Declaration. He is asking concertgoers to sign petitions endorsing the document. But the tour, which already has passed through Budapest and will eventually reach Sao Paulo and Harare, among other cities, is not designed to register new members; Amnesty International itself is hardly mentioned at the gigs. Mr. Healey casts the tour in rather more mystical terms as &quot;a magical newspaper&quot; that will &quot;awaken a sense of freedom,&quot; for illiterate as well as literate.    I'm not sure how many illiterates there were at the opening date at Wembley Stadium, outside of London, but there certainly were a lot of people who had never heard of Amnesty International. And if they left with any idea of what human rights meant, it was that the term was a synonym for freedom of personal behavior, rather than political action.    In the past, Amnesty International always held fast to the Enlightenment conception of human rights as the transcendent possession of the free and oppressed alike. It has limited its work to political imprisonment, unfair trials, torture and the death penalty. Realizing that if human rights includes everything it means nothing at all, the organization has always refused to endorse the argument from the Soviet bloc that such so-called social and economic rights as a minimum wage, health care, and the right to paid vacations exist on the same moral plane as political rights. This is why it is so disturbing to see Amnesty International's name suddenly associated with a notion of human rights so vague that it is almost meaningless.    It is even more worrisome to see Amnesty International slinging around a slogan like &quot;Human Rights Now!&quot; Built around small groups of dedicated members who &quot;adopt&quot; political prisoners and involve themselves in direct relationships with them, the organization works for relief that often takes years. Members are warned not to expect immediate results, and perhaps not to expect any results at all. What they discover is that through persistence and hard work, incremental improvement is possible, and that external pressure is sometimes an effective tool. &quot;Human Rights Now!&quot; is breeding an unfortunate illusion that the disrespect for human rights is amenable to a one-off, rock-show solution.    Amnesty International officials argue that the concerts in countries identified as major violators of human rights will be especially useful, since they will exert pressure on those governments to improve their records. With that strategy in mind, the organization is negotiating to include a Moscow date at the end of its tour. But a Russian concert probably would be a mistake for Amnesty International. Next time they are accused of violating human rights, the Soviets could point to their &quot;relationship&quot; with the human-rights organization. Amnesty International's place is pressuring dictators to free political prisoners, not negotiating with them about concert venues and logistics.    One could excuse the escapade if Amnesty International needed the cash. It doesn't. The concerts will lose something on the order of $10 million by the time the tour winds up in Buenos Aires on Oct. 15. To pay for the losses, Concerts for Human Rights has secured sponsorship from Reebok International, which has shrewdly picked up on human rights as a pitch for its shoes.    &quot;Amnesty's objective dovetailed with our corporate philosophy about the right for freedom of expression,&quot; commented Reebok's president, Joseph LaBonte. &quot;We both believe strongly in the freedom to do what you want.&quot; The company's newest advertising slogan is &quot;Reeboks let U B U.&quot; Amnesty International has tried to keep its distance from this sort of tackiness, but the wider problem is the trivialization of human rights by association with pop stars who may mean well but just aren't appropriate spokesmen for the issue. Soft rock is no substitute for hard work.    ---   Mr. Weisberg is a reporter in Newsweek magazine's London bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
