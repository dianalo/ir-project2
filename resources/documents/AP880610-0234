Iran is expected to net about $1.6 million as a result of thedeal, reached after three days of talks in London between Britishand Iranian officials.   ``Broad agreement has been reached on the basis of the proposalsput forward by the British government in May 1987,'' said a ForeignOffice statement.   Under those proposals, Iran will pay Britain for damageinflicted by mobs on the British Embassy and associated buildingsin Tehran in the late 1970s, and Britain will pay a larger sum forthe burning of the Iranian Embassy in London during a 1980 hostagesiege and rescue.   The Iranian Embassy declined comment on the talks.   British newspapers and politicians of the governing ConservativeParty have welcomed the negotiations. They say the negotiations maylead to improved relations with Iran and better chances of freeingWestern hostages _ at least two of whom are British _ held bypro-Iranian kidnappers in Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
