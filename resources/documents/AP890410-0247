Chairman Donald Petersen earned$10.5 million in compensation last year, mainly from exercisingstock options, the company said Monday.   Separately, Ford announced the appointments of three newexecutive vice presidents including Allan Gilmour, who isconsidered Petersen's likely successor.   The compensation for Petersen and four other top executives wasdetailed in Ford's annual proxy statement, which is being mailed toshareholders in advance of the company's May 11 annual meeting.   Ford was the nation's most profitable automaker last year, withearnings of $5.3 billion.   Petersen got $3.3 million in salary, bonuses and other benefitsand gained $7.2 million from exercising stock options last year.   His compensation topped the $3.7 million Chrysler Corp. ChairmanLee Iacocca received for 1988. General Motors Corp. was expected toissue its proxy statement within a week.   Ford President Harold Poling earned $4.1 million, including $2.6million in salary and other compensation and $1.5 million fromexercised stock options.   Last year, Ford reported that Petersen exercised no stockoptions and received $3.7 million. Poling last year exercised stockoptions worth $8 million and received $10.9 million in totalcompensation.   United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber and Vice PresidentStephen Yokich, who heads the union's Ford Department, criticizedthe payments as part of ``Detroit's annual executive pigout.''   ``We think it would be far better advised to invest in newfacilities and hire more employees rather than squander valuableresources on trying to keep up with the junk bond barons,'' theysaid in a statement.   Other Ford officers listed in Monday's proxy statement, alongwith their salaries, supplemental compensation payments and stockoptions exercised, were:   _Louis R. Ross, executive vice president for North Americanautomotive operations and named Monday as executive vice presidentfor international automotive operations, $3.5 million.   _Philip Benton, executive vice president and president of theFord Automotive Group, $3 million.   _Gilmour, Ross' predecessor in international operations who wasappointed executive vice president for corporate staffs, $1.7million.   The appointments of Gilmour, Ross and Alexander Trotman, whosucceeds Rosee, become effective May 1.   Because Gilmour was the only one of the three also named to theoffice of the chief executive _ which is shared by Petersen, Polingand Executive Vice President Stanley Seneker, the company's chieffinancial officer _ he is seen as the likely choice to succeedPetersen when the chairman reaches Ford's mandatory retirement ageof 65 in the fall of 1991.   At the end of March, Vice Chairman William Clay Ford Sr.,grandson of the company's founder, retired from the company and histitle was eliminated. Ford, who was a member of the office of thechief executive, will remain a member of the company's board ofdirectors.   The promotion of Gilmour, 54, leaves only General Motors Corp.without an heir apparent to its chairman. GM Chairman Roger B.Smith is expected to retire when he turns 65 in July 1990.   Last November, Chrysler Corp. promoted Gerald Greenwald to vicechairman, tapping him as the likely successor to Chairman LeeIacocca, who is not expected to seek a new contract when hisexpires in December 1991.   Gilmour joined Ford in 1960 as a financial analyst. He has beenpresident of Ford Motor Credit Co., vice president and controller,vice president for external and personnel affairs in 1984, andexecutive vice president and chief financial officer in 1986. Hetook over the company's international operations in October 1987.   Ross has been executive vice president for North Americanautomobile operations since February 1985. He joined Ford in 1955as a research engineer. In the 1950s and '60s he worked in variousjobs in the engineering and manufacturing ends of the business. Helater worked overseas and in Ford's truck operations before movingto the North American operations.   Trotman joined Ford of Britain in 1955 and had a variety ofplanning responsibilities before being elected vice president forFord's European truck operations in 1979. Last year, he becamepresident of Ford of Europe. Last February, he was appointedexecutive vice president for North American automotive operations.</TEXT></DOC>
