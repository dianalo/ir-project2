Union leaders and management signed an agreement lateThursday to end the strike at Renault's Cleon plant despitean 807-717 rank-and-file vote to continue the walkout. Only1,524 of the 6,500 workers at the factory voted.</LP><TEXT>   But the communist-dominated Confederation Generale duTravail, one of the three unions that signed the agreement,said in a statement: &quot;One phase of the conflict is ending,but the dispute over our demands remains. The fight willcontinue in other ways.&quot;   Under the proposal, management agreed, among other things,to increase profit-sharing tied to productivity and not fireworkers who damaged company property during the strike.   The strike had halted production at Renault, whichestimated strike-related losses at about 100 million Frenchfrancs (about $18 million) a day.   French Prime Minister Edith Cresson hinted Friday at animpending shake-up in the top management at Renault and othernationalized corporations.   In a radio interview, Mrs. Cresson said the long strike atRenault highlighted the need for a change. &quot;There is anelitist French tradition in which the training of managers istoo far removed from employees,&quot; she said. &quot;There has to begreater worker participation, like in other countries wherepeople talk to each other. Conflicts of this type shouldn'texist, and I'll take the necessary steps to ensure that theydon't happen in the future.&quot;   Mrs. Cresson is known to be displeased at the way RenaultChairman Raymond Levy handled the strike at Cleon. Mr. Levy'smandate as the head of Renault runs for another 18 months,but officials close to Mrs. Cresson have let it be understoodthat Mr. Levy may leave before then.</TEXT></DOC>
