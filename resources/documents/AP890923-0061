Iran's official Islamic Republic New Agency and Tehran Radioquoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as urging Moslems around theworld to ``break their silence over these atrocities'' by SaudiArabia's royal rulers.   A statement from the fundamentalist Hezbollah said the executionswere ``a terrorist act ... The deep grudge which rules the actionsof the terrorist pagan regime ... will be a motive for avenging theblood of the oppressed.''   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is the pro-Iranian umbrella groupthought to hold 16 Westerners hostage in Lebanon, including eightAmericans.   A Pakistani man was killed and 16 other pilgrims were wounded inthe bombings on July 10 near the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Islam'sholiest city.   Sixteen Kuwaiti nationals were beheaded Thursday for the blasts,believed connected to an age-old feud between Sunni and ShiiteMoslems. Most Iranians are Shiites, while Saudis and other gulfstate Arabs are mainly Sunnis.   Iran's spokesman, who was not identified, denied Saudi chargesthat Iranian diplomats in Kuwait trained and equipped the terroristswho set off explosions at the height of the Moslem pilgrimage, orhajj.   He said recorded confessions of the condemned men, screened bySaudi television, were ``false allegations disseminated by theRiyadh government.''   Saudi Arabia said the executed men all were Kuwaiti nationals,but most were of Iranian, Saudi or Qatari origin. Four otherdefendants were sentenced to 15 and 20 years in prison and 1,000 to1,500 whiplashes for the bombings. Another nine people wereacquitted. The rulings were made and upheld by lower and appealcourts made up of Islamic scholars.   The Iranian spokesman rejected confessions by the condemned menthat they were provided with explosives and timing devices by twoIranian officers at the embassy in Kuwait, Mohammed Reza Gholoum andSadek Ali Reza.   ``Those people were never employed in the Iranian Embassy inKuwait, and the Kuwaiti government is fully aware of this,'' thespokesman said.   Kuwait has not commented on the executions.   The Iranian spokesman said the attacks were carried out by``mercenaries working for Saudi Arabia ... to suppress Moslems who... reject the Saudi rulers' control of the two holy shrines'' _Mecca and Medina.   Two years ago, he charged, Saudi Arabia pushed pilgrims ``intoblood and dust for the crime of disavowing the pagans.''   More than 400 people, mostly Iranians, died in clashes with Saudisecurity forces in Mecca in 1987.   The disturbances were the most serious of a series of incidentsduring pilgrimages since Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979, fueledby Iranian efforts to politicize the hajj and encourage other Moslemnations to seize shrines at Mecca and Medina from the control of thekingdom's Saud royal family.   After the violence, Saudi Arabia limited the number of pilgrimsand two years ago broke relations with Tehran, citing subversion andterrorism.   Lately, Iran's new President Hashemi Rafsanjani has indicated hewould like to mend the rift.   The Iranian spokesman said Riyadh's accusations against Tehranare part of a campaign by Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan andInterior Minister Nayef Bin Abdel-Aziz to keep relations strained.   ``This faction strongly desires continuation of enmity,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
