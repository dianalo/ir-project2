GM said it will have to idle its car plant in Ypsilanti,Mich., and lay off 4,200 workers for two weeks beginning Aug.13 because the Gulf conflict has derailed an order forChevrolet Caprices and Buick Estate Wagons.</LP><TEXT>   Kuwait is one of the best overseas markets for NorthAmerican-made GM cars. Kuwaitis particularly liked big,full-sized GM sedans such as the Caprice. The auto maker hadtwo dealerships in Kuwait that sold about 10,000 GM vehiclesin 1989, most of them built in North America. GM sold a totalof about 40,000 vehicles in the entire Mideast region lastyear.   Earlier this week, GM said it was suspending work oncontracts with Iraq's State Enterprise for AutomotiveIndustry under which the auto maker was to have helped theIraqis build a plant that would assemble North Americandesigned GM cars and trucks.   Separately, GM began to feel the effects of a strike at akey parts-making facility in Flint. The auto maker yesterdayidled its truck plant in Moraine, Ohio, that builds sportutility vehicles, putting 2,500 workers on lay-off.   GM may have to idle as many as two more plants todaybecause they've run out of parts supplied by the Flintoperation, a company spokesman said. He declined to identifywhich plants could be affected. GM has said as many as eightof its North American assembly factories could be idledwithin the next few days if the Flint walkout isn't resolved.   Negotiations to settle the strike continued yesterday, butwithout any apparent movement. &quot;There hasn't been anythingserious to discuss,&quot; a top UAW official said yesterday. Talksare scheduled to continue today.</TEXT></DOC>
