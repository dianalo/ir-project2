The legislation is expected to sail through the House and the Senate, perhaps next week, and then to be signed by President Reagan.    Under current law, the Federal Railroad Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department, may fine companies for violating safety rules, but it can't act against individual employees. The new legislation, sponsored by Sen. James Exon (D., Neb.,), would give the government the authority to fine workers and managers and, under some circumstances, to bar them from jobs that affect safety.    The bill also would require the Transportation Department to establish standards for locomotive operators, including a licensing requirement if the department thought it necessary. And it would increase to $10,000 the maximum civil penalty for each safety violation, and provide for an additional fine of as much as $20,000 for a &quot;grossly negligent violation.&quot; Currently, fines range from $250 to $2,500. The bill also would specifically prohibit tampering with rail-safety devices. </TEXT></DOC>
