Five years after the breakup of the Bell System monopoly, new entrants in the U.S. market for phone switching equipment have yet to make major inroads, still trailing ATandamp;T of New York and Northern Telecom Ltd. of Mississauga, Ontario, in technology.    &quot;In 1984, the big story was: 'Who was going to be the third supplier?'&quot; to the Bell operating companies, said Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. &quot;They (foreign companies) have done zippo.&quot;    The GTE-ATandamp;T venture, which will include some GTE factories, will allow the Stamford, Conn.-based company to graft ATandamp;T technology onto its own GTD-5 digital switches, which are sold mainly to GTE's local phone companies. ATandamp;T initially will own 49% of the venture, increase its stake to 80% after the first five years, then own all of it in 15 years. After unsuccessful negotiations for a similar venture with Siemens AG of West Germany a few years ago, GTE turned to ATandamp;T, company executives say, in part because similarities in switch design made it easier to transfer technology -- mainly software -- from the ATandamp;T switch to the GTD-5.    &quot;Although the foreign vendors have been here for a couple of years,&quot; said Jeff Siegel, GTE executive director, product development, &quot;they have to spend a lot of time&quot; adapting their switches to the North American market &quot;and that is a big cost.&quot;    Analysts, the Bell companies and suppliers themselves say that in the U.S. market for digital phone switches, it is too early to count out companies such as Siemens, Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson of Sweden and NEC Corp. of Japan. Because the U.S. phone network requires the most sophisticated equipment in the world, &quot;entering the switch market isn't a two- or three-year process,&quot; said Sean White, president of Northern Business Information Inc., a technology research concern. &quot;It's a 10- to 15-year process.&quot;    Nonetheless, &quot;I am sure the Europeans, in general, have found both the level of competitiveness and the way of doing business in the U.S. more different and difficult than they expected,&quot; said Peter Thomas, president and chief executive officer of Ericsson Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of the Swedish concern. While the fact that the U.S. phone network isn't government-owned has played a part, foreign makers also have been daunted by the high sophistication of the equipment and services that U.S. customers demand.    Ericsson and Siemens can't yet offer switches on par with ATandamp;T and Northern Telecom in Centrex features, which allow phone companies to sell to businesses services such as conference calling and four-digit interoffice transfers. Northern Telecom is partly owned by Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. of Montreal.    And Ericsson hasn't announced &quot;integrated services digital network,&quot; or ISDN technology, which allows simultaneous transmission of voice and data on one phone line. Indeed, GTE chose to form the switch joint venture with ATandamp;T rather than foreign suppliers, said GTE's Mr. Siegel, because &quot;we see ATandamp;T as the leader in ISDN,&quot; which will form the base for new phone services in the 1990s.    The Bell companies, similarly, say that while they want a third or fourth supplier to keep ATandamp;T and Northern Telecom on their toes, they aren't yet satisfied with the products of the new entrants. &quot;All three have good technology,&quot; Casimir S. Skrzypczak, Nynex Corp. vice president, science and technology, said of Siemens, Ericsson and NEC, but &quot;all three need further modification to be fully up to standard of what we are looking for in this market.&quot; In addition to new services, makers must offer automatic monitoring and support systems that allow changes and repairs to be made from a computer terminal rather than manually.    But because modification of existing switches to fit the U.S. market can cost as much as $1 billion over five years, industry executives believe at least one of the current players will be forced to drop out of the U.S. market in the 1990s. Ericsson and Siemens each say that, to make an adequate return, they want 10% of the U.S. market by then. But Bell procurement executives say this is unlikely, given the slow pace of new switch purchases.    &quot;There is room for three suppliers, but not four,&quot; Mr. White of Northern Business said. &quot;Either half the Bells will settle on Ericsson and the other half will settle on Siemens and they'll both starve to death, or one will get the upper hand.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
