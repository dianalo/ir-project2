ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   If President Reagan's proposed budget actuallybecomes America's budget for 1989, it will mean that the federalgovernment will collect $1,687 in individual income taxes for everyman, woman and child in the country.   That's an increase of $65 from the budget he presented a yearago, due almost entirely to economic growth.   The mathematics are straightforward. Divide the $412.4 billionexpected through individual income taxes during the year by 244.4million people, the U.S. population as of Jan. 1. Last year, whenthe total population was 242.1 million, the assumption was thatindividual income taxes would bring in $392.8 billion.   According to the budget proposal Reagan sent to Capitol Hill onThursday, the federal government expects its total receipts in 1989to be $964.7 billion. Besides the personal income tax, the sumincludes corporate income taxes of $117.7 billion and SocialSecurity taxes of $354.6 billion. The rest will come from estateand gift taxes, customs duties, excise taxes and the like.   Using the same population formula for this year, the totalreceipts represent $3,947 for everyone from the tiniest to theoldest centenarian.</TEXT><TEXT>   The source of money flowing in to the government has changedgreatly in the Reagan years, the administration points out. Theindividual and corporate income tax share of total receipts in 1989is expected to be 4.7 percentage points less than 1980 when threeout of every five dollars came from income taxes.</TEXT><TEXT>   The administration tagged two displaced worker programs forextinction because they have not ``operated efficiently to helpworkers adjust.''   One provides unemployment benefit payments when unemploymentinsurance runs out. The administration feels those additional weeksof payments ``encourage workers to delay efforts to seek newopportunities in the hope that somehow their old jobs willreappear.'' In the current year, the program cost $48 million infederal money.   The second program, costing $287 million in 1988, pays statesfor helping dislocated workers find new occupations that use theirskills, get training in new skills or meet the cost of looking forjobs. That money, says the budget, should go into a new WorkerReadjustment Program.   The administration also wants to drop a work incentive programthat provided job services, training and public service employmentto welfare recipients.   ``Although its aim is to help curb welfare dependency, it hasnot proved successful or cost-effective,'' the proposal said. Thegovernment budgeted $93 million for the program this year.</TEXT><TEXT>   Reagan's budget proposal for 1988 asked Congress to tack on $1for every ticket for international travel to and from the UnitedStates to be used for a government program that encourages foreigntravel to the United States.   Congress did not pass the legislation last year and theadministration wants it brought up again.</TEXT><TEXT>   Money for recreation is to be cut back under the proposal from$1.7 billion this year to $1.4 billion.   To make that cut, the administration wants to reduce the amountspent for buying land from $232 million to $51 million. And itproposes a halt in buying some land for park and refuge purposesthrough 1993 _ except for wetlands acquired with revenue from saleof duck hunting stamps and the like.</TEXT><TEXT>   The budget also makes clear that pardons are on the increase.Last year, there were only 23 pardons granted by the president.That number is estimated to increase to 50 this fiscal year and 50again in the next. There was no explanation. The number of``denials and no actions,'' _ 290 in 1987 _ is expected to increaseslightly to 300 this year and next.</TEXT></DOC>
