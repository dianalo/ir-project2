The U.S. is at the brink of war with an adversary armedwith a terrifyingly lethal weapon -- one capable ofinflicting massive military and civilian casualties. Sofrightening is this weapon that its possession has beenglobally banned by international agreement. As a result, theU.S. does not possess an in-kind deterrent to the use of sucha weapon against its forces or people; worse yet, it lacksvirtually any capability to minimize the devastation theenemy might inflict by that use.</LP><TEXT>   Does this sound too awful to be plausible? Unfortunately,the U.S. faces just such a prospect today in the threat posedby Iraq's potential for biological warfare and America'svulnerability to such an attack. Amid the feverishspeculation about the risk of an Iraqi chemical attack, thisweapon in Saddam Hussein's deadly bag of tricks has receivedaltogether too little attention.   In 1972, the U.S. and virtually every other civilizednation signed the Biological Weapons Convention, whichprohibits the development, stockpiling and use of biologicalarms. In accordance with the convention's terms, the U.S. hasnone of these terrible weapons that kill through the use ofvarious strains or combinations of toxic viruses, somecapable of replicating and spreading extremely rapidly.   This is so even though powerful evidence exists thatothers around the world, notably the Soviet Union and Iraq,have proceeded to acquire biological weapon capabilities,notwithstanding the convention. In fact, within the past fewweeks, the Soviet newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta disclosedthat a notorious accident in Sverdlovsk was -- as the Reaganadministration long maintained -- an &quot;accident&quot; in the Sovietbiological warfare program.   In the face of such evidence, it is nothing less thanscandalous that the U.S. government has failed for more than15 years to conduct meaningful research even into defensivemeasures required to detect, type and neutralize the effectsof lethal biological warfare. As a result, there is nowlittle more than a vestigial -- indeed, pathetic -- programin place for protecting Americans against biological weaponattacks.   Most terrifying of all, with the dawn of the era ofgenetic engineering, even nations with relativelyunsophisticated technology bases can acquire toxic virusesthat defy ready classification, require complex antidotes --if any exist -- and can penetrate the charcoal filtrationsystems of the best protective equipment.   For years, American policy makers have treated the growingmenace of noncompliance with the Biological WeaponsConvention with benign neglect. The crisis with Iraq makesobvious what should have been understood all along: Such apolicy is irresponsible and potentially disastrous.   If the U.S. chooses for moral or other reasons to remainbound by the Biological Weapons Convention's prohibition onpossessing offensive biological weapons -- effectivelydenying itself on a unilateral basis an in-kind deterrent --it must at the very least now undertake a crash program ofresearch into technologies associated with detecting, typingand defending against biological warfare.   The U.S. must also avoid the present temptation to repeatthe mistakes inherent in the Biological Weapons Convention.Completing a new and utterly unverifiable treaty banningchemical weapons -- as the Bush administration is determinedto do -- will simply add yet another technology to the listof biological and toxin weapons possessed by renegadenations, but not by those that abide by internationalagreements.   What is more, the present danger that Saddam might employbiological weapons (or, for that matter, any of the otherinstruments of genocide at his disposal) against the forcesor people of the U.S. or those of friendly nations is justone more argument for taking urgent steps to eliminate thisthreat. Saddam in the past has shown no hesitation in usinggenocidal weapons. Thousands of Kurds within Iraq, who werethe victims of his chemical warfare, can attest to that.   As Sen. Richard Lugar (D., Ind.), a senior member of theSenate Foreign Relations Committee and respected authority oninternational affairs, observed last week: &quot;I think {ifSaddam Hussein merely takes his troops and leaves Kuwait, itwould} leave us in a very unsatisfactory situation. . . .Saddam Hussein must either leave {office} or be removed.Likewise, {his} nuclear facilities and . . . chemicalfacilities should be destroyed.&quot;   Iraq's unprovoked aggression has created a uniqueopportunity and compelling justification for carrying outSen. Lugar's prescription. Accordingly, President Bush shouldimmediately issue an ultimatum to the government of SaddamHussein. It should require within 48 hours:   -- The immediate withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from andrelinquishing of Baghdad's control over Kuwait.   -- An agreement to destroy within 30 days and underinternational supervision all biological, chemical andnuclear weapons-related facilities and stockpiles andballistic missile sites.   -- The immediate release of all Western nationals nowbeing held hostage.   Such an ultimatum may encourage Iraqi opposition elementsto remove Saddam if he refuses to comply. Absent Iraqicompliance, however, the U.S. (and such allied forces as arewilling to participate) should move swiftly and with deadlyeffect against his regime, its power base and particularlyits lethal arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.   ---   Mr. Gaffney, formerly a senior Defense Departmentofficial, is the director of the Center for Security Policyin Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
