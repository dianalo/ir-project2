Speaking at the Conservative Party annual conference in Brighton, England, Mr. Parkinson gave his firmest commitment to date on the privatization of the British coal-mining industry. The Conservatives face another general election in 1992 at the latest.    &quot;Coal will be privatized. By the next Parliament we will be ready for this, the ultimate privatization,&quot; Mr. Parkinson said. The defeat of the coal miners' strike in 1985 is widely seen as a milestone in the United Kingdom government's bid to curb trade-union power in Britain. </TEXT></DOC>
