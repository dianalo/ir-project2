Now, finally, there is hope that an end to the conflict maybe within reach.   The latest step in the process occurred Monday when SouthAfrican Foreign Minister Roelof Botha said a ``de facto cessationof hostilities'' is now in effect in Angola, the scene of direct orindirect military involvement by the Soviet Union, the UnitedStates, Cuba and South Africa.   The imponderables in the region are many and just keeping trackof all the players is no small achievement.   The Cubans have been in Angola since that country's independencefrom Portuguese rule in 1975. South Africans have foughtintermittently in Angola, worried about Marxist penetration in anarea close to home. The Angolan Army, of course, has been a majorplayer, arrayed against both the South Africans and a U.S.-backedrebel group. Finally, in Namibia, a black nationalist liberationmovement has been fighting South African colonial control.   The trick for U.S. diplomats, led by Assistant Secretary ofState Chester Crocker, is to devise a formula that would induceeach of the five to lay down its arms.   For years, progress was negligible but things began to changewhen Crocker, serving as peace mediator, succeeded in convening ameeting of South African, Cuban and Angolan authorities in Londonlast May.   At that meeting and in three subsequent sessions, the outlinesof a settlement have come into view.   Following is a brief summary of the interests of each party:   South Africa _ It has said for years that it would be willing toallow independence and black majority rule in Namibia so long asthe estimated 50,000 Cubans leave Angola in a reasonable time.Continued colonial control of Namibia has been expensive for SouthAfrica and the departure of the Cubans would ease its securityconcerns about Angola.   Cuba _ Its initial reason for becoming involved in Angola was toprotect a Marxist ally against South African military encroachment.If the South Africans promise to leave, that would remove theexcuse for which the Cubans were sent to Angola in the first place.Cuba could withdraw its troops with its head held high, claimingthat Angola was now safe from South African aggression.   Angola _ It has been devastated by years of warfare. A Cubanwithdrawal could make the government more vulnerable to attacks bythe anti-communist guerrilla movement. On the other hand, the UNITArebels under the package deal now being negotiated would no longerreceive assistance from South Africa, whose forces would bewithdrawn to within the country's national boundaries.   SWAPO _ Known formally as the South-West Africa People'sOrganization, SWAPO is the Namibian rebel group that has beenfighting South African colonial rule for more than 20 years. OnceSouth Africa consents to elections for an independent government,SWAPO can finally lay down its arms and reintegrate into Namibiansociety.   The Soviet Union _ It has poured hundreds of millions of dollarsinto Angola in support of its ally over the years. Moscow has beenshowing increasing eagerness in promoting a settlement, apparentlyintent on cutting costs in an area of minimal strategic concern.   The United States _ Its main interest is eliminating the Cubanmilitary presence in Africa. Cuba's inclination to send largeexpeditionary forces to distant lands has long been a sore point inWashington. For the past three years, the Reagan administration hasbeen sending military aid to the UNITA rebels in Angola.   UNITA's fate is not under discussion in the U.S.-mediated talks,which are focused exclusively on external involvement in theregion. The United States has been prodding the Angolan governmentto open national reconciliation talks with UNITA.   A key hurdle will come later this month when the parties attemptto reach agreement on a timetable for Cuban withdrawal from Angola.Diplomats have never been more optimistic but Botha is advisingcaution, insisting that the cease fire is ``the first step of avery long, arduous road'' to peace.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   George Gedda has covered foreign affairs for TheAssociated Press since 1968. </TEXT></DOC>
