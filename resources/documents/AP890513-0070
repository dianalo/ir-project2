While Wright's eight-lawyer defense team filed a series ofmotions contesting the formal case against Wright last week, thespeaker was battered by a series of reports and events _ includingthe resignation of a top aide over the aide's criminal past _ thatkept him publicly on the defensive.   The motions ``have the look of a formal, high-risk,all-cards-on-the-table strategy,'' said one Wright supporter, Rep.Pat Williams, D-Mont. But he noted a ``significant'' change inperceptions of Wright's standing among colleagues: ``There's a newgloomy, dark feeling among the speaker's supporters.''   One participant in a recent strategy meeting in Wright's officelikened the atmosphere to what it must have been like inside theNixon White House during Watergate, according to two sources whowere there.   Many _ and not just the speaker's supporters _ are bitter aboutwhat they see as the unfairness of a process that holds Wright to anew and tougher behavior standard than the one that prevailed whenmany of the alleged rules violations occurred. But few deny thereality of the political damage already done.   ``The daily revelations are not helpful,'' said Rep. JimSlattery, D-Kan. ``There's a two-front war being waged here. One isthe technical legal war, and the other is the public relations war.It would be a good idea to win both. It's absolutely essential thatyou have a clear victory in one or the other.''   Two other Midwestern Democrats from different states, who a fewweeks ago believed Wright might be able to survive as speaker, nowhave changed their minds. ``He should step down. This hurtseverybody,'' said one, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.``He can survive the ethics question, but I don't think he cansurvive the political question.''   Those who have come to such a conclusion are not willing to bequoted by name, fearing reprisals or being seen as disloyal.   One reason for the changing mood is that lawmakers have grownweary of the public's perception of Congress as preoccupied withits own internal problems. Serious public policy problems, such asthe federal budget deficit, are not getting the attention theydeserve, they contend.   Wright's potential problems have grown faster than his legalteam, which he bolstered last week with the addition of Houstontrial lawyer Stephen Susman, senior adviser Clark Clifford andseveral associates.   On Thursday, John Mack, one of the speaker's most able andtrusted senior aides, resigned amid new reports about hisconviction 16 years ago for a brutal attack on a woman.   Mack said in a statement he did not want to become an additionalburden to Wright, but the resignation raised the profile of anmatter with greater emotional content than many of the ethicscharges surrounding the speaker. ``It tended to personalize thespeaker's problems,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.   Since the ethics committee formally charged Wright on April 17with 69 instances of violating House rules, new problems havesurfaced each week:   _ Former employees of the Pacific Institute, a Seattle, Wash.,firm that markets motivational programs, have questioned whetherWright's wife Betty did any work to earn the $36,000 salary she waspaid from 1984 until the ethics probe opened last June. Wright'soffice issued a statement last week from company chairman Louis E.Tice asserting that ``Mrs. Wright's performance of her assignedduties was excellent.''   _ The committee continues to look into a lucrative Texas gasdrilling venture that yielded a quick $170,000 profit for Wrightlast year, and plans this week to question Fort Worth lawyer TomLaw, the administrator of Wright's blind trust.   _ News stories have raised questions about whether Wrightreceived preferential treatment in his unsuccessful $100,000investment in a Texas nursing home venture, receiving dividends andinterest payments unavailable to other investors. Wright also isreported to have taken unreimbursed plane rides on the company'saircraft, but the speaker said he can recall no such rides.   _ The Justice Department has expressed renewed interest inWright's dealings, and said this week it will review the evidencefor possible criminal violations once the House ethics case runsits course.   One member of Wright's team, Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,defended the speaker's emphasis on his legal defense. ``That hasalways been the speaker's strongest position. The principlestruggle now is to prevail legally. The politics will follow.''   The lawyers soon will make oral arguments on their crucialmotion to dismiss the most serious charges, probably the week ofMay 22.   In making his assessment, Torricelli conceded a point that onlyunderlines Wright's troubles: that House rules are out of date withcurrent public expectations. ``Time has passed, circumstances havechanged and ethical standards have appropriately risen,'' he said.   Implicit in that statement is that Wright's dealings _ sellinghis books in bulk to interest groups and accepting financialbenefits from a Fort Worth friend _ while meeting the letter of therules, are out of step with Washington's new, tougher ethicalclimate.   ``There's such a tremendous shifting sand of ethical standardsright now that nobody's really clear on what is ethical and what isnot,'' Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in ethics,said in a recent speech to lobbyists. ``Ethical mores in Washingtonchange almost daily. You have to keep ahead of the curve.''</TEXT></DOC>
