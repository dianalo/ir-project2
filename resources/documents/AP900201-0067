WYMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some journalists may have been tipped totop-secret military plans of the invasion of Panama hours beforethe action began Dec. 20, but no one reported it before troopsbegan landing, an Army general says.   ``I had strong indications, based on people I talked to, thatthe press had a pretty strong indication about Tuesday (Dec. 19) asto what was going to happen, and they didn't run it,'' Army Lt.Gen. Thomas W. Kelly told an audience Wednesday at the Universityof Notre Dame.   ``So I think they earned a big plus for being good Americans andnot breaking the story.''   Kelly, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, didnot specify who may have known of the top-secret plans or how wordmight have leaked. He refused to accept reporters' questions andconfined his remarks to an informal talk before an audience ofabout 1,000, mostly university ROTC cadets.   Broadcast news reports the evening of Dec. 19 reported Americanplanes landing every 10 minutes at the U.S. base in Panama. Reportsalso indicated troops had left Fort Bragg, N.C., but did notindicate where they were going.   Since the invasion, there have been reports that strongmanManuel Antonio Noriega, who was deposed after the U.S. troopsarrived, had been tipped to an imminent invasion but refused tobelieve it.   During his wide-ranging talk, Kelly defended the invasion,castigated Noriega's leadership of the Panamanian Defense Forcesand discussed tactics.   ``We wanted to go in at 1 o'clock in the morning because we ownthe night,'' said Kelly. ``Our forces train at night, and justabout no one else's do. `We have night vision devices that no oneelse has.''   The Pentagon reported scattered resistance from Noriegaloyalists up to a week after the invasion.   About 14,000 soldiers joined 12,000 troops already stationed inPanama in the invasion ordered by President Bush, who said theoperation was undertaken to protect American lives, safeguard thePanama Canal and hunt down Noriega.   Kelly said the invasion, announced under the code name OperationJust Cause, was planned under a more innocuous name _ Blue Spoon.   ``Blue Spoon was a sort of covering,'' he said. ``If you hadcome across it on a piece of paper, you wouldn't think anything ofsomething called Blue Spoon.''</TEXT></DOC>
