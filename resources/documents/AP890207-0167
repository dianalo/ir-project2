KUNII</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Japan's stock-profiteering scandal claimed anothercasualty Tuesday, a leading opposition leader, and other governmentopponents hope his resignation will hasten the fall of PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita's government.   Saburo Tsukamoto stepped down as chairman of the DemocraticSocialist Party. He was the only one of four opposition memberslinked to the scandal who had refused to step down.   His departure opens the way for the opposition to unite and renewdemands for Takeshita and his entire Cabinet to resign whenParliament convenes Friday.   Many influential politicians and business leaders were offeredcheap, unlisted shares in Recruit-Cosmos Co., a real estatesubsidiary of the information-based conglomerate Recruit Co.   Shares rocketed in value immediately after they were offered forpublic trading in October 1986. Tsukamoto admitted in December thathe earned about $77,000 in the transaction.   Such lucrative dealings already have led to more than 20resignations, including those of three Cabinet ministers of thegoverning Liberal Democratic Party and three other oppositionmembers.   The transactions are not illegal, but they have incited publicoutrage and raised questions of political ethics.   Takeshita has denied any knowledge of Recruit stock trading byhis secretary, and has ruled out opposition demands that he resignand call an early election.   Instead, he has pledged to restore public trust in politics.   Tsukamoto also denies wrongdoing. The 61-year-old party chiefresigned only after party elders demanded he take responsibility fortarnishing the name of the third largest opposition group as itprepares for a major legislative election in July.   ``If my resignation can bring gains for the party, I decided itis better for me to withdraw now,'' said Tsukamoto. The party   Economist Takashi Ishihara predicted his action will bring``major political changes.''   Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for EconomicDevelopment, told reporters he now expects the ruling party to havedifficulty passing the fiscal 1989 budget.   Keigo Ouchi, secretary-general of the Democratic Socialists, toldreporters Tuesday: ``We have made our position clear in our ownparty ... and now we plan to cooperate with other politicalparties'' in clearing up the Recruit scandal.   Takako Doi, chairwoman of the largest opposition Japan SocialistParty, welcomed Tsukamoto's resignation, saying it would allow theopposition to join forces to ``question the responsibility ofTakeshita and other ruling party officials'' implicated in thescandal.   Tsukamoto, who has served nine terms in the House ofRepresentatives, will retain his seat in Parliament, where his partyhas 29 of the 512 seats.   He will remain chairman until his party's convention Feb. 22-23,when a successor will be chosen.</TEXT></DOC>
