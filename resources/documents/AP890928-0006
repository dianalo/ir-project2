Police loaded the protesters in wheelchairs into buses equippedwith wheelchair lifts _ devices the demonstrators were demanding beprovided on Greyhound-Trailways buses. Those arrested were chargedwith disorderly conduct or criminal trespassing and released.   Wednesday's demonstration marked the third day of protests inAtlanta by American Disabled for Accessible Public Transportation.Members of the group occupied a federal building Monday and Tuesdayin an unsuccessful bid to force the federal government to orderwheelchair lifts installed on public buses.   That protest ended Tuesday when Bush administration officialspromised to urge Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner to meetwith the protesters.   On Wednesday, police began arresting demonstrators after morethan 18 buses were forced to park on side streets to unloadpassengers because protesters were blocking the bus terminal.   First taken into custody were protesters sitting on buses,parked in front of them or sitting inside luggage compartments.   Barricades were placed on either side of the station to blockoff passers-by as protesters locked their wheelchairs together andchanted, ``Access is a civil right.''   Protest leader Michael Auberger said the group was demonstratingagainst a Greyhound-Trailways policy requiring passengers inwheelchairs to bring someone with them to carry them on and offGreyhound buses.   Tom Street, regional manager of Greyhound-Trailways, had askedpolice to arrest the protesters _ one of whom chained himself bythe neck to the steering wheel of the Nashville, Tenn.,-bound bus.   ``This is to symbolize how the private industry tries todiscriminate against us,'' said Clayton Jones, 41, of Houston.``They feel if they give you a place to live you should live insidethe four walls and not have any other life.''   Auberger said the group targeted the bus line for Wednesday'sdemonstration because Greyhound-Trailways has refused to addwheelchair lifts to its buses because of the costs.   ``We're making improvements to handle the handicapped. We can'thandle it in tis manner,'' said Street, refusing further comment.   Greyhound's ``helping hands'' policy requires a passenger in awheelchair to be carried on and off the buses but allows acompanion to travel with the disabled passenger free of charge. Thepolicy also prohibits battery-powered wheelchairs inside the bus.</TEXT></DOC>
