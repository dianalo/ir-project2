Only hours before the opening session of the convention, Jacksonrallied his delegates with a stirring speech and some toughadmonitions.   He also told them to gather again Friday after the convention toplot their role in the fall campaign.   ``This is the first time since Jamestown, Va. ... that we've hadthe right to take to the floor any issue of our interest ... thefirst time ... the first time ... the first time in 400 years,''the preacher told more than 2,000 delegates and supporters at hisheadquarters hotel.   ``We can't lose. We came in a winner. Let's enhance our winningby discipline,'' Jackson added. ``When the lights come on tonight,our foreparents will be crying from their graves.''   When Jackson delegates are faced with media interviews on theconvention floor, they should ``follow my lead ... reflect myspirit, attitude and discipline,'' he said.   Over and over again, he led the delegates in a chant:``Discipline. Details. Hope.''   Jackson mentioned Democratic nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis inpositive tones, but did not issue a rally cry for the fall.Instead, he phrased it in terms of his supporters being part of thefall campaign and of the party at all levels.   Jackson said his forces already had won major battles on theparty platform that will come up for a vote during Tuesday'sconvention session _ mentioning in particular its designation ofSouth Africa as a terrorist state.   ``But there is unfinished business,'' he said, mentioning budgetplanks and a plank calling for a ``no first use'' of nuclearweapons policy.   ``It's not right to be in the seats on the floor tonight and notin the budget next January,'' Jackson told his delegates.   But he warned that they may _ and probably will _ lose to theDukakis forces who have the numbers to control the convention floor.   ``If you negotiate away your self respect, you lose before youget to the floor. We can afford to lose a vote. We cannot afford tolose our self-respect,'' Jackson said.   To those who ask where the fireworks will be between Dukakis andJackson, he said: ``We did not come here for fireworks. We camehere for noble works.''   Jackson told a news conference of foreign reporters that he andDukakis did not discuss the platform at their Monday morningmeeting.   Instead, they dealt with their relationship, ``some focus on ourcampaign for the fall'' and Jackson's role in that campaign and``some focus on the DNC,'' he said, referring to the DemocraticNational Committee.   Jackson told his delegates and supporters that he wanted themall back in the room for a meeting Friday, the day after theconvention ends, to talk about where the movement goes and whatthey will do in the fall campaign.   The platform was one of four items he detailed as his agenda forthe future beyond 1988.   A second apparently was a detail of his agreement with Dukakis,struck at the Monday morning meeting.   ``When the Democratic National Committee meets on Friday, itwill be more reflective of the new Democratic Party,'' he said.Twenty-five at-large members of the DNC will be appointed Fridayand apparently Jackson supporters will receive some of those seats.   Another part of Jackson's future plans is a political actioncommittee, which he calls Keep Hope Alive PAC.   And the fourth point on his agenda was a state-by-state effortto enact on-site election-day registration and wipe out closing theregistration books 30 days before the voting.   In another hint of the future, Jackson said proudly: ``Wenegotiated new rules for 1992.''   At the news conference with foreign reporters, Jackson said hehoped Iran's announced acceptance of a cease fire in its war withIraq would be a positive sign ``to gain the opportunity of freeingthe American hostages.''</TEXT></DOC>
