The guarantee of all deposits at the Bank of NewEngland contrasts with the action taken at the smallerFreedom National Bank of Harlem, where investors withdeposits over the $100,000 limit imposed by the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. lost a significant portion of theirinvestments. Obviously, Freedom National Bank was consideredToo Small to Save.   When the comptroller of the currency first espoused theToo Big to Fail policy, many expressed concern over itsperceived fairness and its effect on the competitive balanceof the industry.</LP><TEXT>   One potential problem is that it removes any possibilityof default, allowing covered banks, especially those in theweakest financial position, to avoid paying a risk premium ondeposits. Furthermore, since a bank's costs are no longertied to its riskiness, the bank has an incentive to invest inriskier loans, which increases the probability of bankfailure.   A second difficulty is that while the benefits of thepolicy accrue only to covered banks, its costs are borne byall banks in the form of higher expected future insurancerates. This is further support for arguments that the depositinsurance system induces a redistribution fromwell-capitalized, conservatively run banks to large and riskybanks. As recent actions have also substantiated, the costsof such a policy ultimately affect the taxpayer.   In an article published in the Journal of Finance inDecember, my colleague Wayne Shaw and I examined some of theeffects of the adoption of the Too Big to Fail policy inSeptember 1984 on both included and excluded banks. Althoughthe comptroller of the currency did not specifically identifythe included banks in his testimony before Congress, he didavow that the policy would apply to 11 banks. In reportingthe story, The Wall Street Journal assumed that the nation'slargest banks were the beneficiaries of the policy and listedthe 11 it believed were &quot;too big to fail.&quot; These were Bank ofAmerica, Bankers Trust, Chase Manhattan, Chemical Bank,Citibank, Continental Illinois, First Chicago, J.P. Morgan,Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Security Pacific and WellsFargo.   Our research revealed significant average increases instock prices for the banks listed in the Journal on the daythe article appeared. The price increase was largest forbanks in the weakest financial condition. In contrast, thestock prices on average fell for the banks not on the list,with the price drop positively related to the size of thebanks. These results are consistent with an interpretationthat the market perceived the Too Big to Fail policy to bevaluable to included banks and costly to their closestcompetitors.   One interesting finding of our study was that not all thebanks listed in the Journal turned out to be the actualintended beneficiaries of the policy. According to the Officeof the Comptroller of the Currency, the comptroller'soriginal intent was to cover the 11 largest &quot;national&quot; banks.The 11 banks listed by the Journal, however, included fourstate-chartered banks outside his jurisdiction. As a result,the stock prices of two of the four intended beneficiaries(Bank of Boston and Crocker National Bank) fell after the TooBig to Fail announcement (the stock prices of two others,Marine Midland and Mellon Bank, did not), while the fourstate banks on the Journal's list (Manufacturers Hanover,Morgan, Bankers Trust and Chemical) reaped unintendedbenefits.   These results highlight the potential inequities of a TooBig to Fail policy and illustrate how the ambiguity over whatbanks it applies to may cause the markets to react negativelyto some of the very banks it is intended to help. Indeed, therationale generally given for such a policy is that it allowsthe government greater flexibility in dealing with probleminstitutions. The difficulty with that reasoning is that itignores the perverse effects the policy has on both includedand excluded banks.   It may be a legitimate governmental policy that some bankscannot be allowed to fail. What is not obvious, however, iswhy it is necessary to subsidize those banks at the expenseof others.   A deposit insurance system that relates the cost ofinsurance to the scale of coverage and to the risk of theinsured would mitigate the perverse incentive andredistribution effects that arise under the current system.Indeed, one vivid, and expensive, lesson that emerged fromthe Sandamp;L debacle is that charging insurance premiums unrelatedto risk can result only in increasing the risk of the systemto the breaking point. As Congress debates the variousproposals for deposit-insurance reform, it should bear inmind that the current Too Big to Fail policy may ultimatelyresult in a banking system too sick to save.   ---   Ms. O'Hara is professor of finance, Johnson GraduateSchool of Management, Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y.</TEXT></DOC>
