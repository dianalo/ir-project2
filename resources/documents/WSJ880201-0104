On a recent Fresno television newscast, Mr. Stewart, a vermin specialist with the county health department, was offering residents helpful hints on spotting rodent invasions. One sure sign is rat droppings, which Mr. Stewart described as resembling &quot;unwrinkled raisins.&quot;    Mr. Stewart's description was all too clear to some people in Fresno, where raisins are taken quite seriously. The town is the hub of California's $150 million raisin industry, and Mr. Stewart's remark went over in some circles like a ton of prunes.    Irate raisin growers phoned the TV station to say that Mr. Stewart's remark could undermine the raisin's image, which raisin boosters have spent tens of millions of dollars on advertising to improve. Raisin industry members quickly began a letter-writing campaign to denounce what they considered Mr. Stewart's off-hand slight to Fresno's favorite crop. One indignant raisin dignitary publicly called Mr. Stewart's analogy a &quot;stupid remark&quot; -- and even suggested he be fired.    Mr. Stewart, stunned at the outcry, says he hadn't intentionally meant to sully the raisin -- but he also doesn't think that his remark will result in the raisin industry's destruction.    Many people apparently agree -- at least that he shouldn't be fired. The health department says it has gotten scores of phone calls and letters from Fresno County residents who support Mr. Stewart. Letters to the editor in the local newspaper, the Fresno Bee, have been running heavily in Mr. Stewart's favor while &quot;pouring scorn on the raisin people,&quot; says Tom Kirwan, editor of the Bee's editorial page.    Mr. Stewart has tried to defuse the situation by publicly apologizing and promising to describe all future signs of rat infestations in non-raisin terms. He also notes that his raisin analogy isn't original -- state health department officials have used it for years -- &quot;though I threw in the wrinkled part.&quot; Still, Mr. Stewart adds, &quot;I'm sorry I said it. After all, this is the raisin capital of the world.&quot;    Officials of the Fresno-based Raisin Administrative Council who had led the castigation of Mr. Stewart didn't return phone calls to discuss the matter. But Mr. Stewart says that he has been told privately that -- barring some slip of the tongue -- the council won't press to get him fired. </TEXT></DOC>
