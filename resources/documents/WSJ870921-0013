The authorities, readopting the slogan &quot;root out leftists,&quot; is arresting and imprisoning people ideologically and pragmatically opposed to President Chun Doo Hwan's government. More than 50 people have been seized in the past two weeks on charges of encouraging sedition and violating the National Security Law.    The renewed anti-leftist campaign has dismayed some political moderates and diplomats and has prompted charges that the authorities are again trying to silence their foes by abusing powers of arrest and regulations controlling the media.    &quot;We've seen all this many times before,&quot; said a leader of the National Coalition for a Democratic Constitution, the federation of opposition politicians and dissident groups. &quot;But it's supposed to be different now. That's what the June movement was all about.&quot;    He was alluding to President Chun's pledge on July 1 to initiate democratic reforms following 20 days of violent anti-government demonstrations.    Choi Chang Yoon, vice minister for culture and information, defended the crackdown as necessary to safeguard the democratic process. &quot;The most serious threat to democratization is radical leftists,&quot; Mr. Choi said, and the government &quot;will continue mop-up operations.&quot;    He defined &quot;radical leftists&quot; as &quot;ideologically oriented critics&quot; of the government. He put their number at &quot;about 1% to 2%&quot; of South Korea's 1.2 million university students, or between 12,000 and 24,000.    These radicals, he added, &quot;mobilize about 20% of the students, the moderates, for demonstrations.&quot; He described moderates as &quot;those who have some complaints with the government, as well as naive, discontented dissidents.&quot;    Some Korean politicians and academics, as well as diplomats, expressed dismay at the new campaign, saying they are baffled by its timing. &quot;The social atmosphere in Korea is calmer today than it's been in 18 months,&quot; said a European ambassador. &quot;Most labor strikes are settled, the student demonstrations are attracting only a few hundred radicals and the mood of the country seems much more positive than it was two weeks ago. So why now?&quot;    A Seoul National University professor said he suspects the government is trying to &quot;polarize the nation and force Koreans into thinking they must choose between what they have and communism&quot; as the country approaches a presidential election, scheduled to be held by Dec. 20. Once again, the professor said, he and his colleagues are afraid to criticize the authorities publicly for fear of persecution.    Some South Korean newspapers have joined forcefully in the anti-leftist campaign. The Korea Herald, one of the nation's two English-language dailies, warned in an editorial yesterday against &quot;moves masterminded by leftists&quot; to &quot;sabotage the democratic process&quot; in Korea.    &quot;In a democratic society, of course, a variety of voices is natural,&quot; the newspaper said. &quot;Yet we must discern which ones are intolerable as they threaten our survival. We must protect the innocent from falling prey to agitators whose goal is to undermine our liberal democracy.&quot;    The Herald said the country can't simply rely on the police to crack down on &quot;those producing seditious publications&quot; but that &quot;society at large is responsible for that job.&quot;    The editorial met an angry response from some diplomats and academics, who said it would fuel the worst fears of a society already highly sensitive to the communist threat. &quot;It's hysterical red-baiting,&quot; said a U.S. diplomat.    But another diplomat dismissed concerns that the latest crackdown will garner much support, saying most Koreans are unlikely to be convinced by shrill warnings against leftism. &quot;What the government and (the Herald) are saying is that the democratization of Korea is threatened by the free expression of ideas,&quot; said the diplomat, who represents an Asian country. </TEXT></DOC>
