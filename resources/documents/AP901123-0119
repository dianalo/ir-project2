The republic's communist-controlled Parliament on Thursdaydenied requests to allow opposition officials into state-runballot-counting commissions, and permit some Serbs abroad to votein the Dec. 9 election.   A statement by 12 opposition parties said Parliament's decisionblocked the ``most elementary conditions'' for fair elections and``wiped out the last chance of compromise'' with the rulingSocialists, the new name adopted by the communist party.   The statement also demanded the resignation of Serbia'scommunist President Slobodan Milosevic and the ouster of Parliamentleaders and other communist officials.   The parties urged voters to join the boycott and attend aprotest rally Dec. 3 in Belgrade.   The statement was signed by leaders of the center-right SerbianRenewal Movement, the Democratic Party, the Serbian branch offederal Premier Ante Markovic's Alliance of Reformist Forces, andother parties.   About 50 opposition parties are registered for the vote. Manyhave complained they had less access to state-controlled media fortheir campaigns.   Vuk Draskovic, who was the top challenger to Milosevic, said hisRenewal Movement had planned to contest all 250 Parliament seats.But under the boycott, only Milosevic's Socialists and a few newlyformed communist groups would run, he said.   The statement said unfair elections would make Serbia ``alongwith Albania, the last Bolshevik ghetto in Europe'' and isolate therepublic.   Following the vote Thursday, Parliament Chairman Zoran Sokolovicsaid current law, drawn up by the Socialists, ensures democraticelections.   Nebojsa Popov, head of the small opposition Union for YugoslavDemocratic Initiative, said the vote would be ``a farce'' under thepresent election rules.   Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, andMontengro, the smallest, are the last to hold multiparty elections.   Communists were ousted last spring in the western republics ofSlovenia and Croatia.   In the central state of Bosnia-Hercegovina, nationalist partieshad a landslide victory over communists.   In last November's single-party Serbian elections, unregisteredvoters were allowed to cast ballots in some districts. Milosevicwon with 104 percent of the registered voters in some areas.   Parliament also began discussing a ban on the DemocraticAlliance of Kosovo, which opposes Serbia's rule over the Kosovoprovince, where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 1.9million people.   The Democratic Alliance, supported by the ethnic Albanians,registered as a party with federal authorities, but not withSerbian officials. Serbia clamped down on the province's autonomyin July after Kosovo's parliament declared sovereignty.</TEXT></DOC>
