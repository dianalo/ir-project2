Like other German companies, Kloeckner reports itsfinancial data both on parent-company as well as a group orconsolidated basis. At the group level, Kloeckner posted anet profit of 30 million marks. Under German regulations, acompany's dividend is paid from the parent company'sprofit-and-loss account, not from the group.
