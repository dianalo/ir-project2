Four British legislators are to arrive Sunday in Tehran, theIranian capital, on a similar mission.   Iranian radio and television reports monitored in Nicosia saidthe representative of Robert Runcie, archbishop of Canterbury andhead of the Church of England, met with Mehdi Karrubi, deputyspeaker of Parliament.   The envoy brought a letter from Runcie that ``expressed hopethat efforts for the release of Iranian and British hostages inLebanon will be fruitful,'' Tehran radio said.   It did not name the representative, but in London thearchbishop's public affairs office said Friday that John Lyttle wasin Tehran representing Runcie. The statement said no furtherinformation would be released until the visit ended.   Tehran radio said Runcie's letter was addressed to HashemiRafsanjani, speaker of the Iranian Parliament, and called forbetter relations between London and Tehran. It said the letter alsocondemned Iraqi use of chemical weapons in the war with Iran. Iranand Iraq have been fighting since September 1980.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency issued a reportdenying a Church of England statement on Friday that said fourmembers of the British Parliament had been invited by Iran todiscuss improving ties.   The agency quoted an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman assaying the British legislators ``had intimated an interest invisiting Tehran and their offer simply has been accepted by Iran.''   The lawmakers in the mission, expected to last three days, areCyril Townsend and Robert Hicks of the governing ConservativeParty, Thomas Clarke of the Labor Party and Lord Tordoff of theSocial Liberal Democrats.   Eve Keatley, a spokeswoman for the Church of England, saidFriday the four were not going to negotiate the release of hostagesbut to find ways to improve relations that might lead to such arelease.   In London the Foreign Office stressed the British government wasnot sponsoring the trip, which was organized through Runcie'soffice.   Eighteen Westerners, including nine Americans and three Britons,have disappeared in Lebanon and it is believed most were kidnappedby pro-Iranian militants.   Terry Waite, the 49-year-old foreign affairs advisor to Runcie,disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, during his fifth mission toseek the release of foreign hostages held in Lebanon.   The other missing Britons are John McCarthy, 31, a televisionjournalist, and Alec Collett, 64, a New York-based journalist.   An Islamic extremist organization has claimed Collett was killedbut there has been no proof that he is dead.   The longest-held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   In addition, the Iranian Embassy in Beirut said 17-19 Iranianswere believed to be held hostage in Lebanon.   Diplomatic ties between Britain and Iran were reduced tocaretaker status a year ago but improved when the countries agreedduring talks in London last week to compensate each other fordamages to their diplomatic offices.   The Iranian Embassy in London caught fire when British commandosstormed it in 1980 to end a hostage siege. British diplomaticbuildings and the British Embassy in Iran were damaged by mobs in1978, 1979, and 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
