Aguilar, 58, was indicted by a federal grand jury last month oncharges he used his office to do favors for convicted felons.   Among other things, he is alleged to have sought favorabletreatment for two felons from other federal judges and tipped off anex-mobster about a court-ordered wiretap. In the process, theindictment said, Aguilar turned his office into a ``racketeeringenterprise'' to obstruct justice.   Aguilar, a 1980 appointee of President Carter, has not commented,but his lawyers contend the case is politically motivated because ofAguilar's liberal record and his rulings against the government inseveral important cases.   If convicted, Aguilar faces up to 55 years in prison. Theindictment is the fourth this decade against a federal judge and thefirst racketerring charge ever against a federal judge.   Monday's arraignment before visiting U.S. District Judge HowardBratton of Albuquerque, N.M., lasted less than 20 minutes, andAguilar stood with his lawyers before the bench for less than threeminutes.   Dressed in a gray business suit, he repeated ``the plea is notguilty'' to the first two charges read by the court clerk, beforeBratton said further reading of the charges was unnecessary.   Allowed to go free without bail, Aguilar left through a rear exitwithout talking to reporters.   Aguilar, who can be removed from office only by congressionalimpeachment, has retained his judge's title and $89,500 salary, butrelinquished most of his duties while the case is pending.   Justice Department prosecutor Ralph Martin did not object to theno-bail release, but asked Bratton to prohibit Aguilar fromcontacting any potential witnesses. Martin noted that one chargeaccuses the judge of advising a witness to lie to the grand jury.Bratton refused the request.   Defense lawyer Patrick Hallinan told reporters the request wouldhave barred Aguilar from speaking to ``half of his family'' anddescribed it as part of the government's campaign to portray Aguilaras a corrupt judge.</TEXT></DOC>
