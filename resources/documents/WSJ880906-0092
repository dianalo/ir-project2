The rise from 5.4% in July marks the second monthly increase in the jobless rate since it hit a 14-year low in June, the Labor Department said.    &quot;Employment grew modestly in August . . . , considerably less than the monthly average during the first half of the year,&quot; Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said.    The department said 219,000 jobs were created in August, compared with 200,000 in July. The July figure was previously reported as a 283,000 gain. Both these gains are substantially lower than the June increase of 532,000 new jobs.    Manufacturing jobs fell by 5,000 in August after an increase of 45,000 in July. The department said that though employment growth in export industries, such as electrical equipment, paper and chemical, remained strong, other industries such as textiles and furniture lost jobs in August.    Jerry Jasinowski, economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, said last month's weakness in the factory sector reflects cautiousness by manufacturers in the face of sluggish orders for consumer goods.    &quot;There will, therefore, be a reluctance by manufacturers to increase hiring until it is clear what orders are going to be,&quot; Mr. Jasinowski said.    It is dangerous to read too much into a single month's statistics, and some economists contend that though the unemployment rate has increased, the pace of economic growth is likely to remain strong.    Charles Lieberman, economist at Manufacters Hanover Trust Securities Corp., said he believes the increase is likely to be a &quot;one-month's breather.&quot;    &quot;I think it is unconvincing to argue that the economy has slowed down. . . . There is still strength in exports,&quot; he said.    Nevertheless, economists said the report should allay at least some inflation fears. The average hourly earnings, a closely monitored wage measure for signs of inflation, remained unchanged at $9.31 in August.    The average hourly earnings index, which excludes wage changes caused by factory overtime and shift differentials, rose slightly to 179.4% of its 1977 average from 179.3% in July. This increase is a considerably slower rise than the month before.    The average work week for non-farm workers and factory overtime fell slightly but remains &quot;at extremely high levels by the standards of the past two decades,&quot; Mrs. Norwood said.    The service sector, which provides employment for three out of four non-farm workers, continued to register strong increases, with a rise of 227,000 jobs in August after a revised July increase of 137,000. The July rise had previously been reported at 201,000.    The increase in unemployment is unwelcome news for Vice President George Bush and Republican candidates who have been campaigning on a platform of strong job creation.    Susan Estrich, campaign manager for Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, called the unemployment increase a &quot;blow to the hopes for prosperity&quot; and said the loss in factory payrolls &quot;confirms fears that the trade deficit is worsening.&quot;    A spokesman for Mr. Bush called the unemployment increase &quot;an incremental change that is irrelevant when compared to the unemployment figure of seven years ago.&quot; He added that &quot;this also shows that fears of inflation are unfounded.&quot;    The department also reported in its survey of households that employment increased by 121,000 in August after a 41,000 gain in July. The household survey is used in calculating the unemployment rate but is considered less accurate than the department's payroll survey. The household survey counts each employed person once, while the payroll survey counts the number of jobs held by a person.    The figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.    Here are excerpts from the Labor Department's employment report. The figures are seasonally adjusted.
