It said Italians andNigerians were arrested.   The vessel M.V. Piave was seized as it docked to discharge itscargo, said Yusufu Maman, press secretary to the chief of generalstaff. He did not say how many people were arrested or give furtherdetails, saying only that the defendants would soon be brought tocourt.   Maman said five shipments of waste had been made to Nigeriasince last September.   The Ministry of External Affairs said Thursday it was recallingNigeria's ambassador to Italy in protest and was asking Italy torecall its ambassador.   Italy was asked to remove the 2,000 tons of toxic waste, whichreportedly included radioactive material, discovered by newspaperreporters in Bendel state. Press reports earlier said the waste wasshipped to Nigeria from Italy.   In Rome, Foreign Ministry officials said they assured Nigeriathe government will work ``in a spirit of maximum collaboration,including determining responsibility'' in the case, the Italiannews agency AGI reported.   The ministry said the Italian company purportedly involved was aprivate one, and the case should not involve ties between the twocountries, AGI said.   Maman told reporters his government viewed ``with great concernthe criminal act of ... (shipping) industrial waste into Nigerianterritory.''   He said the dumping was meant to embarrass Nigeria for leading adrive to halt developed countries from disposing of nuclear andother toxic wastes in Africa.   A report in Caracas, Venezuela, this week by the Greenpeaceenvironmental organization said increased waste shipments to Africamark a growing trend.   ``In particular, Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America havebecome the preferred dumping grounds of waste peddlers fromindustrialized countries,'' it said.   Dumping of toxic waste in Africa has become a growing scandal.   The government of Guinea announced Thursday in Conakry, thecapital, that Norway's consul general was arrested for complicityin the secret dumping of 15,000 tons of toxic waste from the UnitedStates.   Ibrahima Sory Diaby, Guinean secretary of state for security,said the waste was shipped from Philadelphia, but did not identifythe company producing the waste.   Newspapers here reported on Tuesday that security agents sealedoff the dump site in Nigeria, about 150 miles southeast of Lagos.   Reporters from the Guardian newspaper said they discovered thesite, in the Koko port region of the oil-rich delta region, afterbeing alerted by letters from Nigerian students in Italy.</TEXT></DOC>
