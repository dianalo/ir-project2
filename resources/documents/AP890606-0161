ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Armed with batteries of computers and brigadesof lawyers, Republicans and Democrats are skirmishing for controlof the political shakeup that offers the GOP its once-in-a-decadeopportunity to dent Democratic control of Congress.   ``If we want to be competitive in the House, we have to get agood shake on redistricting,'' said Charles Black, the politicalconsultant who is chairman of the Republican National Committee'sadvisory committee on redistricting.   ``Right now, given the strength of incumbency, there are onlytwo times you get a chance to pick up any congressional seats,'' hesaid. ``One is when the seats are open, and two is when you redrawthe lines.''   For Republicans, redistricting is a chance to break out of theirdepressing status as a seemingly permanent minority in the U.S.House.   Democrats control the House by a margin of 260 to 175. Whilevoters in recent presidential elections have preferred Republicancandidates by landslide margins, Democrats now hold 18 more Houseseats than they did when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated in 1981.   Democrats claim the capital's political split personality comesfrom voters' desire to have Congress act as a balance to GOPpresidents. Republicans claim the split is rooted the Democrats'drawing the lines for most current congressional districts.   Redistricting is the once-a-decade reshuffling of the nation'scongressional districts. It is a three-pronged battle _ technical,political, and legal.   Every 10 years, the U.S. Census counts everyone living in thecountry. This time, the day for the count is April 1, 1990.   For politicians, the most important Census information is nothow many Americans there are, but where they live. For while thepopulation increases, the size of the U.S. House remains at 435voting members.   By Dec. 31, 1990, the Census Bureau will announce each state'spopulation. And the bureau will reveal the reapportionment of theU.S. House _ the number of representatives for each state, based ona complicated mathematical formula.   Then comes redistricting at the state level _ redrawing theboundaries of congressional districts to fit the new population.   Gone are the days when cigar-chomping politicians matched upCensus data with voting lists and redrew lines to help theirfriends and punish their enemies.   They're still helping their friends and punishing their enemies,but now the politicians do it with computers that produce highlysophisticated plans to can do in a legislator with subtle shifts ofcity blocks.   But computers have little value to politicians who don't havethe votes to get their plan adopted.   The two parties are considered on a par technologically, but theDemocrats control 28 state legislatures, while Republicans haveonly 8. In 13 states Republicans control one legislative chamberand Democrats the other. Nebraska has a unicameral nonpartisanlegislature.   The other key players are governors _ 28 are Democrats, while 22are Republicans.   Elections this year and next will determine who controlsredistricting. In the states expected to gain or lose the mostseats, neither party is in control, promising fierce battles forgovernor and legislative seats.   The 1990 Census will certify the shift to the Sunbelt that willhave Congress speaking with a decidedly more Southern and Westernaccent. Based on current estimates, 17 House seats will head Southand West.   California will be the big winner, gaining six seats with anoutside chance of picking up seven. With 45 members in the currentHouse, California already has by far the largest congressionaldelegation.   Other winners are Florida, expected to gain four House seats,and Texas, likely to pick up three. Likely to gain one each areArizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.   The losers are a familiar lineup _ mostly Northern industrialstates that have seen their congressional representation erode inrecent decades.   If current trends hold, New York will lose three seats andPennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and Illinois two each. Losing one eachwould be Kansas, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, West Virginia andWisconsin.   With redistricting clout in the balance, the high-profile racesfor governor are in California, Texas, Florida and Illinois _ allof which are now in GOP hands. But George Deukmejian of Californiaand Bill Clements of Texas are not running for re-election and BobMartinez of Florida is regarded as vulnerable. Jim Thompson ofIllinois hasn't announced yet whether he will seek a fifth term asgovernor.   In addition, the battle for control will be fought in countlesslegislative contests.   For example, in Michigan, Democrats would control the process ifthey capture the state senate where Republicans have a narrowmajority. In Pennsylvania, Republicans control one chamber by fourseats and Democrats the other by three.   After the politicians draw the district lines, the battle willmove to another arena, the courts.   At some point in the 1980 process, redistricting plans in allbut three states ended up in court, says Kimball Brace, presidentof Election Data Services, a consulting firm that works onredistricting for Democrats.   Thus Republicans and Democrats are recruiting teams of lawyersto defend their plans or attack the opposition's in federal andstate courts.   The guiding legal principle stems from the Supreme Court's ``oneman, one vote'' ruling that mandated that legislative districts besubstantially equal in population.   Brace cited a Michigan plan that ended up in court. Republicansoffered a plan with congressional districts differing in populationby no more than four people. But the court ruled in favor of theDemocrats' plan which was drawn with each district identical inpopulation.   How long do districts remain identical in population? Probablynot more than a day or two after the Census is taken.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
