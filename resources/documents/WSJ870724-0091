Delta's fiscal fourth-quarter performance was aided by its acquisition of Western Airlines, effective April 1.    Washington-based USAir, reporting for the second quarter, foresaw continued strength and predicted &quot;a continuing strong travel season through Labor Day.&quot;    Atlanta-based Delta posted fourth-quarter profit of $58.8 million, or $1.21 a share, compared with $22.2 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 41% to $1.57 billion from the year-ago $1.11 billion.    While Delta acknowledged that Western's addition improved the comparison, it also cited strong traffic growth in the quarter, noting its expanded hub in Cincinnati. The carrier had a 47% increase in revenue passenger miles for the quarter. A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger, flown one mile.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Delta's shares closed at $54, up 75 cents.    Delta said its revenue per passenger mile declined, however, due to discounting, but maintained it had managed &quot;a reasonable balance between yield and traffic to produce maximum revenue.&quot; The company also said it had been able to reduce certain expenses following the acquisition.    Delta also increased its quarterly dividend yesterday to 30 cents a share from 25 cents and named Ronald W. Allen as chairman and chief executive officer, succeeding the retiring David C. Garrett Jr.    For the full year, Delta's profit jumped to $263.7 million, or $5.90 a share, from $47.3 million, or $1.18 a share in fiscal 1986. Revenue rose 19% to $5.32 billion from $4.46 billion.    USAir reported record quarterly earnings for the second period of $72.7 million, or $2.33 a share, a more than doubling of the year-earlier's $32.2 million, or $1.08 a share. All 1986 results have been restated to reflect pension accounting changes.    The latest quarter's profit was boosted, in part, by $21.4 million from the company's current 55.5% equity share in the earnings of Piedmont Aviation Inc. USAir's final acquisition of Piedmont is pending government approval.    Piedmont shareholders approved the proposed transaction at a special meeting yesterday in Winston-Salem, N.C.    Without the Piedmont contribution, USAir earnings would have increased 59% in the quarter on revenue of $619.6 million, a 35% increase over the year-earlier's $458.5 million.    Edwin I. Colodny, chairman, attributed the gains to strong traffic at USAir, the recently acquired Pacific Southwest Airlines and Piedmont.    For the six months, the company earned $96.2 million, or $3.14 a share, more than triple the $25.4 million, or 93 cents a share, reported for the first half of 1986. Revenue was $1.08 billion, a 25% gain over last year's $865.5 million.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, USAir closed at $45.875, up $1.375. </TEXT></DOC>
