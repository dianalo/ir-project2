As a result of the ITC's negative critical circumstancesdetermination, pursuant to section 735(c)(3)(B) of the Act, the U.S. CustomsService will refund all cash deposits and release all bonds collected onindustrial belts and components and parts thereof, whether cured or uncured,from Japan entered or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or afterNovember 3, 1988, and before February 1, 1989.
