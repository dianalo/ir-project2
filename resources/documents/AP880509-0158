Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., sent William Bradford Reynolds a copyof the 244-page report, urging him in a letter to ``kindly informus'' of any incorrect information, and pointing out that the reportwas the work of five Democrats and four Republicans.   The report accuses Meese of violating White House ethics policy.   Reynolds on Sunday branded the report as ``sleaze,'' and saidthe policy went into effect after ``the Wedtech thing was referredover to the attorney general.''   However, the Senate report noted that memos sent to Meese fromhis longtime friend E. Robert Wallach about Wedtech came tothen-White House counselor Meese in 1982 as well as in 1981. TheWhite House policy barring contact by White House staff withprocurement officers about a contract in which a friend has afinancial interest took effect in October 1981.   The report is based on ``really a very egregious, incorrectstatement of facts,'' said Reynolds, who also is assistant attorneygeneral in charge of the Justice Department's civil rights division.   Reynolds made his comments in an appearance on the CBS Newsprogram ``Face the Nation.''   ``I don't know whether Reynolds has received the report andletter (from Levin), but, as usual, he will respond in duecourse,'' said Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland.   Meese has acknowledged intervening on behalf of the South Bronx,N.Y., defense contractor to ensure that the company receiving afair hearing from the Army in connection with a $32 million no-bidcontract that eventually, after intercession by Meese's office, wasgiven to Wedtech. The Army initially had opposed giving the work toWedtech, saying the company's price was too high.   Meese's involvement with Wedtech triggered a criminalinvestigation of the attorney general last May 11.</TEXT></DOC>
