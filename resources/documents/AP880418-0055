True? As much as any of the hundreds of anecdotes in a newlyreleased compilation entitled ``The Jokes of Oppression: The Humorof Soviet Jews.''   Jews may not be free in the Soviet Union, but the Jewish joke is_ it doesn't fear jails or labor camps, escapes detection by theKGB, targets sacred institutions and venerated leaders, andpermeates every nook of society.   ``In the absence of an open press in this kind ofclaustrophobic, stifled society, where publicly people wear onekind of face and privately an entirely different type, these jokesare of great significance,'' says the book's co-author, DavidHarris.   Harris, the Washington representative of The American JewishCommittee, spent 10 years collecting the jokes from Jews living inthe Soviet Union, Israel, the United States and Europe. Hisco-author, Izrail Rabinovich, is a Soviet emigre who teaches at theDefense Language Institute in Monterey, Calif.   ``For Soviet citizens, humor is a private way of coping,criticizing, distancing themselves. A punch line, just for a momentor two, permits release of tension and anger that otherwise tendsto build up with no outlet,'' Harris says.   For Jews, in particular, the jokes reflect the pain of a 2.5million minority suffering anti-Semitic persecution andrestrictions on emigration, free worship, and the study of Jewishculture and the Hebrew language.   Last year about 8,000 Jews were allowed to leave the SovietUnion, although the figures for this year have increasedsignificantly. Israel estimates that some 400,000 Soviet Jews wishto leave.   This joke illustrates frustration with repeated rejections ofemigration requests:   A Jew named Khaimovich is turned down for an exit visa becausehe is in possession of state secrets from his place of work.``State secrets? You must be kidding. In my field the Americans areat least 20 years ahead of us,'' he exclaims. ``That's preciselythe secret,'' comes the curt reply.   The jokes, say the authors, are also embraced widely by non-Jewswho identify with the recurring themes of a hostile bureaucracy,discontent with the standard of living, memories of Stalinistterror and frustration with the stifling presence of the CommunistParty.   For instance, the same Khaimovich is being chastised at adistrict party meeting. ``Why weren't you at the last partymeeting?'' asks an official. ``If I had known it was the last, notonly would I have come, but I'd have brought my entire family aswell,'' he replies.   Or this one: ``What's the difference between Catholicism andCommunism?'' The answer: ``In Catholicism there's life after death.In Communism there is posthumous rehabilitation.''   While the humor of other countries doesn't always travel well,laughter about the Soviet Union is usually culturally translatablein the United States. President Reagan enjoys telling jokes aboutthe Russians, and he trots them out periodically at summit meetingswith Soviet leaders.   ``Americans find it reassuring to laugh at the Soviets. Itreinforces a feeling of political and social superiority toward theRussians,'' Harris says.   As a refugee official for Jewish organizations in Europe, Harrisdealt with thousands of emigre Soviets, including Rabinovich, whoarrived in Rome from the Soviet Union in 1976.   The two men discovered an interest in jokes, and although theyhave not seen each other since, they have conducted a prolificcorrespondence for some 11 years which yielded a collection of some2,000 jokes. The book is only a part of the collection.   Americans familiar with the humor of the ``Borscht Belt'' _those areas of the United States with large concentrations of EastEuropean Jews _ will likely be a receptive audience for this one:   Khaim and Abram devised a scheme for crossing the border _dressed up as a cow. As they approached the border in theirfour-legged outfit, Khaim whispered: ``Oy vey, we're in for bigtrouble.''   ``Border guards?'' Abram asked.   ``No, a bull,'' Khaim whispered.   Then there are jokes that appeal on the level of superpowercompetition.   An American and a Russian are discussing their countries'intelligence services. ``The KGB is the best. I hear they'vemanaged to steal all the designs of the major American weaponssystems for the last 10 years,'' boasts the Russian.   ``That's nothing, Ivan,'' retorts the American. ``I know for afact that the CIA has succeeded in stealing from the Kremlin's safethe results of all the Soviet elections for the next 10 years.''</TEXT></DOC>
