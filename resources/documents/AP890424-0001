The scandal and a widely criticized sales tax that took effectApril 1 sent his popularity rating skidding to a rock-bottom 3.9percent and made him Japan's most unpopular prime minister sinceWorld War II.   Takeshita, 65, spoke at a nationally televised news conferenceafter telling a Cabinet meeting he would end his 18-month tenure inoffice, half of it a downhill slide due to a scandal named afterthe Recruit Co. conglomerate.   ``The Recruit question has caused a grave crisis for thenation's parliamentary democracy,'' he said. ``As the chiefexecutive of government and president of the ruling party, I deeplyapologize.''   The prime minister said he will step down after the fiscal 1989budget is passed. That leaves the timing of his resignationuncertain because Parliament is deadlocked by an opposition boycottof budget deliberations. Parliament is expected to pass the budgetby early May.   It also was unclear who would succeed him since other seniorfigures in the governing Liberal Democratic Party are tainted bydonations from Recruit.   News reports cited former Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ito as apossible successor to Takeshita, but Ito is 75 and ailing. He is adiabetic.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with PresidentBush in San Jose, Calif. said Tuesday night: ``Japan is a closeally and friend. We will continue to work closely with the newprime minister and government.''   Takeshita became prime minister in November 1987. He deniedwrongdoing but acknowledged receiving more than $1 million in whathe called legal political donations from the Recruit Co. Weekendnews reports said he also borrowed $381,700 from theinformation-publishing giant in 1987, returning the funds a fewmonths later.   A former Takeshita aide and a relative also profited from salesof the Recruit Cosmos shares for a total of $192,000.   About 17 politicians or their aides and 150 other influentialpeople are known to have reaped profit from sales of hundreds ofthousands of unlisted shares in a Recruit real estate subsidiary,Recruit Cosmos, in 1986. The transactions generated hefty profitswhen the share prices soared after the stocks were made availablefor over-the-counter trading.   Recruit also paid millions of dollars to influential politiciansor their aides as contributions, raising suspicions it was seekingfavors in return.   The chief Cabinet secretary, Reizo Obuchi, said in making thefirst official announcement Tuesday that Takeshita would resign,said Takeshita wanted ``to clarify his responsibility for thepublic's distrust in politicians due to the Recruit question.''   More than a dozen people have been arrested on bribery and othercharges, and three Takeshita-appointed Cabinet members haveresigned in connection with the scandal. Along with Takeshita,former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone; Shintaro Abe, thesecretary-general of the Liberal Democrats, and former FinanceMinister Kiichi Miyazawa have been implicated.   Takeshita said Tuesday he would continue with a planned trip tofive Southeast Asian nations scheduled to start Saturday andlasting through May 7. News reports earlier said he planned tocancel the trip.   After Takeshita's resignation, governing party members wouldchose their next party president, who would in turn become primeminister due to the Liberal Democrats' majority in both houses ofParliament.   Ito, chairman of the governing Liberal Democratic Party'sExecutive Council and an eight-time member of the lower house, toldreporters who had gathered in front of his Tokyo residence beforeTakeshita's announcement late Tuesday morning: ``This is the timefor fundamental political reform.''   Ito and Takeshita met on Monday and afterward both deniedsetting a plan for Ito to take over the premiership.   A recent poll by the Kyodo News Service put Takeshita's supportat 3.9 percent, the lowest ever recorded by Kyodo for a primeminister.   Political analysts say that along with the scandal and lowpopularity ratings, the premier has been pressed by dissent withinthe party because younger party members fear they will not be ableto win elections with Takeshita as their leader.   Elections for half the seats in the upper house are due thissummer, though general elections need not be called by the primeminister until the summer of 1990.   Media reports did not say if Takeshita might call for earlygeneral elections or if the Liberal Democrats would pick asuccessor.   The Liberal Democrats have governed Japan for about 48 years andhold 297 seats in the 512-member lower house of Parliament.   Many of the Recruit donations to Takeshita and others wereticket purchases to fund-raising parties. Such gatherings of fellowpoliticians and business leaders are common in Japan, wherepolitics and business are closely related. They are especiallypopular with the Liberal Democrats as a way around laws restrictingcampaign funds.   In recent weeks, Takeshita had repeatedly vowed to push throughpolitical reforms to restore public trust in government.   The scandal has caused the greatest political fallout in Japansince former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was accused in theLockheed affair in 1976. Tanaka was convicted of taking a $2million bribe after the U.S. aircraft company admitted it spent$12.1 million to advance its sales in Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
