After Iraq crossed the border into Kuwait late last week,some defense stocks climbed 10%, even as the rest of themarket plunged on fears that higher oil prices wouldaccelerate inflation and, at the same time, prompt afull-blown recession.</LP><TEXT>   In the past two days, the run-up has faltered a bit. Butthe question remains: Just how much have the bellicose Iraqisbolstered the fortunes of U.S. military suppliers?   All in all, many securities analysts insist, very littlehas changed during the past week to actually reverse thedeterioration of earnings and balance sheets across theindustry. &quot;The rally has been driven by emotions, notfundamentals,&quot; says defense stock analyst Michael Rosen ofSmith Barney, Harris Upham.   &quot;None of these companies are going to recover overnight,&quot;adds Howard Rubel, aerospace analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence. Hesays that difficult-to-meet Pentagon contracting terms andthe melting of Cold War tensions will continue to take theirtoll on most weapons producers and defense stocks, as theyhave for the past year.   Still, many predict that the situation in the PersianGulf, serious enough to trigger the dispatch of Americanaircraft and soldiers to Saudi Arabia, will at least somewhatslow the defense stock slide. And clearly, there are specificDefense Department programs -- surface ships and fighterjets, for instance -- that are likely to benefit from theflex of Saddam Hussein's muscle if Congress decides to softenplans for tough military spending cuts.   &quot;This is a stark reminder of the volatile world in whichwe live and the irrationality of certain national leaders,&quot;asserts Stanley Pace, the chairman of General Dynamics. &quot;Thisfact necessitates that the U.S. remain militarily strong andable to meet all contingencies.&quot;   General Dynamics' lot, some think, has improved becauseincreases in orders for M-1 tanks and F-16 fighters are astrong possibility. The company also makes submarines, andvirtually all firms that outfit the Navy may find Kuwait'sloss their gain. Among the biggest surface-ship makers areLitton Industries and closely held Bath Iron Works. RobertCostello, former Pentagon acquisition chief, says that onearea potentially spurred by the Iraqi incursion is fastsealift ships, large vessels that are &quot;swift and highlyflexible.&quot;   Missile makers also may find more opportunities. Raytheonis perhaps the most prominent producer of missiles, includingthe Patriot, which the Saudis and Israelis want to add totheir arsenals. Iraq's show of force virtually ensures thatCongress will approve those sales, which could eventuallyaccount for $2 billion or more in revenue. The Iraqi attackalso cements the relatively solid position ofdefense-electronics companies such as Loral and E-Systems.   But for every defense dollar that pours into one of theseprojects, it likely takes away from another program. Evenafter the Iraqi assault, for instance, the Senate proposedscaling back the Strategic Defense Initiative, thespace-based missile shield known as &quot;Star Wars.&quot;   Strategic weapons, such as Northrop's B-2 Stealth bomber,also shouldn't find much relief in the current climate.Although some lawmakers argued this past week that Iraq'sactions were sound reason to keep the embattled programgoing, the fact remains that the plane has been soldprimarily for its nuclear-bomb-carrying capability. &quot;I'm notsure that all the talk really changed any votes,&quot; says onecongressional aide. In the case of other programs targeted bybudget-cutters, such as Grumman's top-gun F-14 fighter, itmay simply be too late to try to save them.   Of course, which companies ultimately win and lose willdepend a lot on whether Iraq dares to push into Saudi Arabiaand risk a major conflict. The trickiest thing to sort out,meanwhile, are those companies that may see both pluses andminuses as a result of the Iraqi onslaught.   Take, for example, McDonnell Douglas. The nation's No. 1defense contractor can certainly make a better case toCongress now to keep open its F-15 fighter line; SaudiArabia, fearful of what Iraq's next move could be, is amongthe countries that want more of the planes. In addition, thecompany's C-17 military cargo aircraft is just the kind ofproject that is likely to get a lift from the turmoil in theMiddle East.   Yet McDonnell Douglas also has a $1.8 billion contractwith Kuwait to deliver 40 F/A-18 Hornet strike fightersbeginning in 1992. That sale suddenly becomes uncertain.Moreover, a recession could have dire consequences forMcDonnell Douglas's massive commercial aircraft division.   Boeing is another mixed bag. The company could conceivablysee its faltering military segment helped by the Iraqiinvasion. Along with Textron's Bell subsidiary, Boeing makesthe V-22 tilt-rotor Osprey. The White House wants to kill thepotential $20 billion program, but some analysts think thatlawmakers now will be more open to the aircraft.   But, even more important, Boeing's robust passenger-jetbusiness could be hurt by an economic slowdown. Although arise in oil prices could eventually force airlines to buymore fuel-efficient planes, Boeing would probably see ordersdropping off and options going unfilled, at least in the nearterm.</TEXT></DOC>
