JesseJackson, disclosing yet another dimension of the bank'seffort to penetrate the political establishment of the West.   Nazir Chinoy, who ran a BCCI regional office in Paris,also said the Democratic Party leader told him he would takea step toward helping BCCI recruit central bank deposits fromAfrica -- accounts that have been frozen or depleted in thewake of BCCI's failure last July. There was no evidence thatMr. Jackson gave BCCI any such help, however.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Jackson denied that he ever gave such assistance.   Mr. Jackson was far from the only political leader to takeheat in a hearing by a Senate subcommittee on narcotics andterrorism. Sen. John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat whoheads the subcommittee, attacked President Bush forpermitting James Lake, a deputy manager of the Bush-Quaylecampaign, to serve as the U.S. public relations adviser forthe majority shareholders of BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A.   &quot;To be blunt,&quot; Sen. Kerry said, &quot;I do not believe that Mr.Lake should be sitting in on White House campaign strategymeetings while he is also providing strategy&quot; to Sheik Zayedbin Sultan al-Nayhan, the president of the United ArabEmirates, who controls a majority of BCCI's shares. He calledon Mr. Lake to resign from the campaign.   An official of Mr. Lake's firm said &quot;The charge made todayby Sen. Kerry is completely without foundation, and isnothing more than election-year politics.&quot;   Sen. Kerry said Mr. Lake's involvement with the majorityshareholders of the bank deserves more scrutiny because ofthe involvement of U.S. government officials with BCCI inintelligence activities. Yesterday's testimony disclosed theextent of BCCI's role in the movement of funds and arms inconnection with the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages scandal,for instance, including the involvement of Lt. Col. OliverNorth as a signatory on three BCCI accounts.   The committee also released a memorandum in which a BCCIofficial in Washington enumerated the steps the bank couldtake to defend itself from federal money-laundering chargesfiled in Tampa, Fla., in 1988. The memo urged &quot;contact withBush administration by friendly Arab countries.&quot;   Mr. Chinoy, the former Paris-based executive who pleadedguilty in the money-laundering case, loaded more sleaze ontothe BCCI scandal, rendering accounts of how the bank procuredteen-age prostitutes for royal family members from the MiddleEast; how it used bribes to draw in $100 million in depositsfrom the African Development Bank; how it helped debtornations circumvent policies and rules of the World Bank andthe International Monetary Fund. Most of the testimony heapednew details on old allegations -- except for Mr. Chinoy'scomments about Mr. Jackson.   He testified that in 1985 Agha Hasan Abedi, the founderand chairman of BCCI, called him to ask that he take care ofthe lodging and transportation needs of Mr. Jackson and histraveling companions when they came through Paris as part ofa visit to Africa. The group's hotel expenses in Paris --about $4,000 en route to Africa and about $6,000 for thereturn trip -- were paid by BCCI's Paris office, which waslater reimbursed from an affiliate in the Cayman Islands.   Mr. Chinoy said that be believed Mr. Jackson met withBCCI's managing director in Nigeria. And after Mr. Jacksonreturned to Paris, Mr. Chinoy said he was told by Mr. Jacksonthat he was impressed by BCCI's &quot;visibility&quot; in Africa.   Mr. Jackson, he testified, also asked if it would beprofitable for BCCI to obtain central bank deposits, and Mr.Chinoy said he enthusiastically said yes. Mr. Jackson thensaid he would follow up on the matter with Mr. Abedi.   Though he didn't hear further from Mr. Jackson and doesn'tknow if he made good on the matter, Mr. Chinoy said, &quot;We hadsuccess in getting a number of central bank accounts inAfrica.&quot;   Mr. Jackson told the Associated Press: &quot;Mr. Abedi, in ourmeetings, never brought that up. He expressed interest inThird World development in the most general sense. But henever offered, and I never offered to engage in, any businessrelationship with him.&quot;   Before its seizure by Western regulators last July, BCCIhad drawn roughly 11% of its $20 billion in deposits fromAfrica. The bank's closing froze many of those funds, causingsevere hardship for governments. The government of Cameroon,for instance, had more than a third of its reserves ondeposit with BCCI.   BCCI depositors may receive 30 cents to 40 cents on thedollar for their deposits.</TEXT></DOC>
