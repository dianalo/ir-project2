More attention has been paid to whether teachers should becompelled to lead the Pledge of Allegiance at the start of eachschool day than to what students learn after that patriotic ritual.   George Bush has said repeatedly he wants to go down in historyas ``the education president.'' The Republican candidate tellsvoters wherever he goes that better schools are the key to a betterfuture for America.   Michael Dukakis, too, avers that he wants to be ``the educationpresident.'' The Democrat gets big cheers every time he promises,``We're going to make teaching a valued and honored professionagain.''   Whichever candidate wins on Nov. 8, educators are confident theeducation budget will be in safer hands under the next presidentthan under Ronald Reagan.   But they say neither Bush, who attended private schools as ayoungster, nor Dukakis, who attended public schools, has doneenough to dramatize the problems facing American schools or tospell out a convincing plan to improve performance.   Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for theAdvancement of Teaching, said, ``We hear strong inspirationalstatements about how important education is, but the direction the`education president' would take is still not clear.''   At the outset of the campaign, ``the candidates were stumblingall over themselves to say this was America's most urgentobligation,'' said Boyer. ``It faded as a central issue.''   Richard Berendzen, president of The American University inWashington, said, ``I grade both on what I hear and what I don'thear. ... I'd give both a D-plus.''   Berendzen said 25 percent of American young people drop out ofhigh school and 20 percent grow up in poverty, and the UnitedStates is far back on international scholastic tests.   ``If you take a sober look at the matter, you could say that thepreparation of our youth today and workforce readiness for the year2000 is one of the two or three top issues facing America,'' saidBerendzen.   Despite the generalities, said College Board President Donald M.Stewart, ``It is obvious both candidates are making the linkbetween economic productivity and international competitiveness andthe underserved, undereducated poor.''   However, Dennis Doyle, a Hudson Institute scholar, said it isinevitable that education will slip to the back of the president'sagenda.   ``Education is 15th or 20th on the real list the president willactually keep, as apart from a campaign list,'' said Doyle. ``Thedeficit, defense, international relations, economic problems, evenhealth care, Social Security, transportation and housing all arehigher on their priority list.''   Both candidates have outlined ways to help families cope withthe soaring costs of college _ Bush with a tax-free savings bondplan, and Dukakis with a new loan program that students would repaythrough payroll deductions.   Bush, whose administration tried to cut $5 billion from theEducation Department last year, actually has proposed biggerspending increases than his rival.   Here are their major education proposals:</TEXT><HEAD>BUSH</HEAD><TEXT>   _ $500 million for a ``merit schools'' program that would rewardschools that raise the academic scores of disadvantaged students.Schools would get up to $100,000 each to spend as they saw fit.   _ $50 million for matching grants to create more ``magnet''schools that emphasize various academic subjects.   _ Expanding from $12 million to $50 million a proposed Fund forInnovation and Reform of Schools and Teaching to give each state $1million for an experimental district trying such concepts asparental choice, merit pay or year-round schools.   _ Money for Head Start, the $1.2 billion pre-school program fordisadvantaged children, would be ``sharply increased'' by anunspecified amount. Bush said he is committed to building HeadStart ``to a level where all eligible 4-year-olds can attendclasses.'' The Children's Defense Fund says the 453,000 childrennow in Head Start are only 16 percent of those eligible.   Bush has also promised to spend more on Chapter 1, a $4.6billion remedial program that serves about 55 percent of eligiblepoor students.   _ Tax-free U.S. Savings Bonds for college tuition. This wouldeventually cost the Treasury $200 million a year; the tax breakwould be phased out for families earning $60,000 to $80,000 orabove.</TEXT><HEAD>DUKAKIS</HEAD><TEXT>   _ $250 million for a National Teaching Excellence Fund toprovide college scholarships and forgive loans for those who becometeachers, launch a new National Teacher Corps, create state teacherretraining centers, recruit retirees to teach, and support afive-fold expansion of a $1.9 million Christa McAuliffe Fellowshipprogram for talented teachers.   _ $25 million for a ``Citizens Literacy Corps'' to supportvolunteer efforts to teach illiterates to read.   _ A Student Tuition and Repayment System (STARS) allowingstudents to pay back college loans through payroll deductions intheir working years. It would supplement, not replace, existingfederal grants and loans, at least at the start. Students would getSTARS loans from banks.   Dukakis officials have suggested a payback rate of one-eighth toone-quarter of 1 percentage point of earnings per $1,000 borrowed,meaning a tax of 2.5 to 5 percent for a $20,000 borrower.   The rate stays the same for low- and high-income earners, butthe loan is never paid off.</TEXT></DOC>
