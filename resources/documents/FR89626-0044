That order is before me for review under 50 U.S.C. App.2412(c).The charging letter alleges 96 separate violations of andSection; 387.6 ofthe Export Control Regulations in effect in 1983 and 1984 (1983/84 Regulations),96 separate violations of andSection; 387.4(a) of the 1983/84 Regulations,and 16 separate violations of andSection; 387.7 of the 1983/84 Regulations.In total, the charging letter alleges 208 separate violations of the 1983/84Regulations.This case has had a tortuous procedural history, including a previous dismissalof the proceedings by the ALJ which was vacated by the Under Secretaryon November 17, 1988. The dismissal now before me for review results froma serious of incidents following the breakdown of settlement negotiationsin late April of this year. First the ALJ refused the Department's requestfor an extension in time to answer Respondents outstanding motion to compela response to requests of admissions. The Department then filed a motionfor judgment on the pleadings which was rejected by the ALJ as ``unresponsiveand untimely.'' The Department then refused to comply with the ALJ's May9 order requiring a response to Respondents outstanding requests for answersto interrogatories and production of documents, insisting that the ALJshould rule on the merits of the Department's motion for judgment on thepleadings. On account of the Department's refusal to comply with his May9 order, the ALJ issued the order of dismissal now before me for review.In his order of dismissal, the ALJ found that the Department's refusalto comply with orders relating to discovery prevented the development ofa full record leaving no alternative but dismissal of the case. The Department,on the other hand, contends that the case can be decided on the existingrecord and that the ALJ's refusal to rule on the merits of the Department'smotion for judgment on the pleadings as well as other allegedly arbitraryand capricious procedural rulings constitute abuses of discretion. Needlessto say, Respondents supports the order of dismissal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>The record in this proceeding reveals a climate of animosity between theALJ and the Department inconsistent with effective enforcement of exportcontrols and obtaining a sound resolution of this case. Some of the ALJ'sprocedural rulings appear to result from less than judicious consideration.In particular, the ALJ's summary refusal to accommodate the joint requestto extend procedural deadlines appears arbitrary in the absence of anyindication that the extension would inconvenience the tribunal. On theother hand, while a careful reading of the Department's motion for judgmenton the pleadings reveals that it was intended to be responsive and notin disregard of the ALJ's May 1 order requiring a response to Repondent'smotion to compel discovery, that document could have been better draftedto make that point more clearly.The Department decision to file a motion for judgment on the pleadingsin a case involving substantial allegations going to the issue of mitigationis also subject to question. In seeking to have the entire case resolvedon a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Department has necessarilyconceded that all allegations of Respondent going to mitigation shouldbe accepted. Yet, these allegations appear to be so substantial and extensiveas to support a cogent argument that not more than nominal sanctions shouldbe imposed even if the alleged violations of the regulations are proven.\1\<NOTE/> Without some better showing than more than nominal sanctionsshould be imposed if the alleged violations are proven, I cannot find thatvacating the order of dismissal and remanding the proceeding for considerationof the motion for judgment on the pleadings would serve the cause of fairand effective enforcement of the Export Control Regulations. Accordingly,for the reasons just stated rather than the reasons stated by the ALJ insupport of his order of dismissal, I have decided that the order of dismissalshould be affirmed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Particular note has been taken to claims asserted by Respondentin mitigation. First, Respondent claims that the alleged violations havealready been adequately sanctioned by the Department's having summarilysuspended Respondent's distribution license in September of 1984 costingRespondents millions of dollars in lost sales. Second, Respondent claimsthat its post 1984 adherence to the Export Control Regulations has beenexemplary.<ITAG tagnum="84">Order</ITAG>Having examined the record, and based on the facts before me in this case,I hereby affirm the ALJ's recommendation that these proceedings be dismissed.This constitutes final agency action on this matter.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: June 19, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joan M.

The approach of Agency Counsel does not appear to have changedin the two years since the Order quoted below was issued. In relevant partit said:<ITAG tagnum="21">The record clearly reflects and demonstrates that the Department'sdilatory tactics respecting discovery have and continue to impair the orderlyprogress of this proceeding, including the Respondent's ability to developand present its equitable defenses. Further, it is noted that this citedrefusal is but another, in a pattern of Agency countenanced actions onthe part of its officials and counsel, which demonstrate a continuing patternof interference and obstruction of the functional independence of therAdministrative Law Judge to conduct fair and impartial due process adjudicationsunder the Administrative Procedure Act and the Export Administration AmendmentsAct of 1985, Pub. L. 99-64, 99 Stat. 120 (<T3>Nash</T3> v. <T3>Califano,</T3> 613 F.2d 10 (1980)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The record of interference and obstruction is demonstrated and documentedin the correspondence and the disposition of numerous cases over the pastyear since the above Act was implemented culminating in the incomplete``Request to Amend Charging Letter'' filed by Agency Counsel on December19, 1986. As with the other of Agency Counsel's filings which are incompleteand mistate the record, it does not provide a basis for coherent action,nor does it reflect the specific guidance given during the December 19conference. Over the last decade, Agency Counsel appears to have presidedover a compliant and secretive administrative adjudicatory process faciallypatterned to provide a fair hearing, but in fact, devoid of independentconsideration or review. The submissions and comments clearly demonstrateAgency Counsel's unwillingness to permit independent inquiry or adjudication,even in the limited area of discovery as provided in the Agency Regulations55 CFR 388.9 Administrative Conference Recommendation 21, and the relevantFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Action is deferred on all other aspects of the Motion except withrespect to attorney's fees which is denied. While it is abundantly clearthat the Counsel and the Agency's failure was not substantially justifiedand such award of expenses would not be unjust, applications for attorney'sfees under the Equal Access to Justice Act to the Department of Commerceare to be filed in the manner prescribed in 15 CFR Part 18. Since no suchfiling was made, no proper adjudication may be considered here. Counsel'sattention is also invited to the recent administrative decision, in thematter of Robert W. Haire, Sr., Docket No. 601-172, December 16, 1986,which would deny such recovery even under the Equal Access to Justice Act,the statutory basis for the sovereign immunity waiver. Here, resort toan Article III court of competent jurisdiction would appear to be morethe appropriate forum to adjudicate the question of fees and expenses inthe course of the judicial proceeding.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Extract from Order of December 22, 1986 in </ITAG><T3>D.S.E., Inc.,</T3> Docket No. 6679-01).BackgroundThe charging letter covering these alleged 1983-1984 violations was initiallydated July 1, 1988. Differences concerning the sufficiency of both theinitial and amended charging letter were determined by the Under Secretary'sOrder of November 17, 1988. An answer was filed on December 19, 1988. Theusual requests were made for the parties to state their position on January11, 1989, and such filings were made before the scheduling Order was issuedon February 17, 1989. On March 9, 1989, Respondent filed requests for Discovery.A Motion to Compel Discovery was filed and an Order issued on April 7,1989, to which a response was directed by April 18. The period in whichto respond to the Motion to Compel was thereafter extended to April 28.In this period it was represented that settlement was imminent. However,the proceedings were not suspended and when further extension was requestedon the due date April 28, it was denied by Order of May 1, 1989, with theadmonition that a complete response was to be filed on May 2, and thatsanctions would be deferred pending that filing. On May 2, 1988, the contemplatedfiling was not made. Rather, Agency Counsel filed a Motion for Judgmenton the Pleadings, which was denied as unresponsive and untimely. By Orderof May 5, 1988 Agency Counsel was again given the opportunity to respondto the outstanding discovery requests, this time by May 9, 1988. On May5, Agency Counsel filed an interlocutory appeal with the Under Secretary,without prior notice or request for certification of the question posed,to this Office.\1\<NOTE/> Following a further extension to May 12, 1989 for the Agencyto respond to all of the Discovery requests, Agency Counsel, on that datefiled a pleading declining to respond to the discovery requests. On May16, 1988, following the initial drafting of this Order, Respondent's Counselfiled a Motion to Dismiss.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The manner of filing the interlocutory appeal is wellcalculated to deny to the Secretary's delegatee a full basis of decision.The usual and better course in such exceptional instances is for the movingparty to request certification of the question by the Administrative LawJudge, noting the intention to file such appeal. The Administrative LawJudge and the opposing party then have the opportunity to comment, presentingthe appellate authority with a complete record for a prompt adjudication.DiscussionIn the present incomplete state of the record this Tribunal perceives noalternative to dismissal of the case, regrettable though that course ofaction is. Agency Counsel's actions have effected a statemate preventingdevelopment of a complete record. The comments on behalf of the Agencyin its Appeal respecting its Motion To Dismiss are at least misleading.The appropriate time for filing a Motion to Dismiss is following the filingof Respondent's answer. While no time is established in the rules for suchfiling, orderly practice, particularly with respect to such a dispositiveMotion, warrants it as well as other such Motions that are directed tothe contents of pleadings, being made as soon after the filing as possible.In addition to the filing being out of time, it was made in lieu of theresponse to Discovery. Since the Agency was then in default, it was inno position to pray for, urge, request or compel dispositive action onan alternative request. Without a delay to allow for the Respondent's Counselto respond, which would materially alter the course and timing of the proceeding,a ruling on the substance of the Motion would have been clearly prematureand inappropriate. The parties had been advised of the pre-hearing andhearing dates. Administrative arrangements had been initiated. Witnessesand other schedules had been set. By such tardy filing, Counsel was notentitled to disrupt the process in this already stale proceeding. If AgencyCounsel had such confidence in the position asserted, the outcome soughtshould have been perceived as inevitable and the proceedings respectingdiscovery and hearing could have continued as provided by the regulationsand the announced schedule. The pre-hearing conference would have beenan appropriate time and place to go over each of the asserted admissionscontained in the Motion. They would, at that point, have been the basisfor a specific finding on the record or identified as an area for disputeto be resolved at the hearing. For Agency Counsel to take the positionthat by some divine inspiration or manifest destiny only he has the visionof immutable truth and right, demonstrates an unacceptable arrogance.Discovery is specifically provided for in Agency Counsel's self scrivinedregulations. A mockery has been made over the years of the valuable right,culminating in this most recent instance of refusal by Counsel to followthe agency regulations. No objection has been made to the discovery requests.No cause has been stated for not responding. An impudent refusal to participatein the process has been manifest by Counsel who is delinquent. The delegeeof the Secretarial Authority may not countenance such misconduct.The arguments of Respondents Counsel in support of this Motion to Dismissare adopted and incorporated herein. <ITAG tagnum="6">Hugh J.
