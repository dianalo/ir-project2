 If my righteye drops to the low vision of my left eye, I will need the characters on mymonitor to be at least two inches high to continue enjoying this fascinatingcomputer.andP;  Are there any programs that I can use to magnify the screen six toten times and then scroll it for viewing?andM;Eugene Lica Tarzana, CaliforniaandM;A reader from Ohio, David Daye, foreseeing a letter such as yours, alerted meto some free publications offered by IBM's National Support Center forPersons with Disabilities (P.O.andP;  Box 2150, Atlanta, GA 30055; voice (800)426-2133, TDD (800) 284-9482), which provide partial guides to computer-basedtechnology available for the physically impaired.andP;  These publications includeresource guides for people with hearing, speech, learning, mobility, andvision impairments.andM;While the resource guides offer only lists--not reviews--of the products,they do provide a good starting point for finding any sort of information youmight need, as well as lists of user groups and on-line services that mayalso be of assistance.andM;From the Resource Guide for People with Vision Impairments, as well as fromother sources, I have located a few products that can help you out.andP;  Anall-purpose text-magnification utility, ZoomText ($495; AI Squared, 1463Hearst Dr., Atlanta, GA 30319; (404) 233-7065) seems to address your problem.andO;ZoomText, a TSR that works with many applications and with DOS command-lineoperations, can magnify characters from two (40 characters by 12 lines) toeight (ten characters by three lines) times.andP;  You can magnify the entirescreen and scroll around, or zoom on only a portion of the screen.andP;  Theproduct also allows you to change colors for maximum contrast.andP;  An especiallynice feature is the smooth font, which lacks the &quot;jaggies&quot; associated withmost screen magnifier fonts.andP;  The only drawbacks are that it needs an EGA orbetter display and does not support a mouse.andP;  AI Squared will also be comingout with inFocus ($149), a similar utility that offers one and a half to twotimes magnification, and is geared toward reducing eyestrain.andM;If ZoomText's $495 list price is too steep for your budget, you can alsocontact Hexagon Products (P.O.andP;  Box 1295, Park Ridge, IL 60068; (708)692-3355), a firm that sells a line of large-font shareware for around $30each.andP;  The products include B-Pop, which is quite similar to ZoomText butlacks some of the flexibility, and B-Edit, a large-type editor that usesWordStar-like keystrokes.andP;  Hexagon's software is also available in DataLibrary 4 of the DISABILITIES forum on CompuServe (BROWSE on the filenamesBPOP*.* and BEDIT*.*).andP;  If you have a Hercules-compatible display, you cantry MAGHERC, another shareware pop-up magnifier, which is available in thesame location on CompuServe (filename: MAGH10.COM) or from MicroMind ($35;417 W. 120th St., New York, NY 10027; (212) 222-2849).andM;COPY INFRINGEMENTandM;QUANDARYandM;I am facing a dilemma.andP;  I was given a used computer as a gift, and the harddrive contains many copyrighted programs.andP;  I don't have the originalinstallation disks, the authorization, or any of the other goodies that go tothe program purchaser.andP;  The drive contains WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, Lotus1-2-3, First Publisher, Norton Commander, and several others.andM;Am I a lawbreaker, and if I am, how do I go about avoiding severe punishment?andO;I thought of writing to the various companies, but fear I may be set upon bythe FBI.andP;  The situation also has other drawbacks, such as asking my kids fortechnical help or posing sly questions around the office.andM;It would seem to me that as the used-computer market swells, this crime willbecome more rampant and could overwhelm the legal system.andP;  Right now, I'mworried only about my own good name and any advice you can give me on how toclear it would be greatly appreciated.andM;Name withheld upon requestandM;Rest assured you won't wake up tomorrow morning with the FBI pounding on yourfront door.andP;  Unless, of course, you decide to go into business sellingpirated software or start a bulletin board system through which people willpass illegal copies.andP;  Most cases of copyright infringement are handled by theSoftware Publisher's Association (SPA; 1101 Connecticut Ave. NW, Washington,DC 20036; (202) 452-1600) or the individual companies themselves, who filelawsuits in federal courts.andM;Before filing suit, however, the software company or the SPA will usuallysend out &quot;cease and desist&quot; letters, warning you of the consequences (alawsuit).andP;  If the piracy problem is rife through a corporation, the suitfiler may request that an internal audit be performed.andM;I'm assuming that whomever gave you the machine with the software installedon it kept all the &quot;goodies&quot; and is using the programs on a new system: if,on the other hand, they gave you the software (and didn't keep backups ormasters) as part of the &quot;gift,&quot; then what you have isn't illegal, merelyincomplete.andM;Frankly, if you are in the position of having to &quot;pose sly questions aroundthe office,&quot; then go out and buy the software.andP;  The &quot;goodies&quot; you refer toaren't just the disks and documentation--they include the right toinexpensive (or free) updates and technical support.andP;  And when you skulkabout the office in search of furtive technical support, you run the risk ofsomeone reporting you to the SPA's Piracy Hotline ((800) 388-7478).andM;The growth of the secondhand computer market probably exacerbates thecopyright infringement problem because it's so easy to be a passive user ofthe copies (you don't have to physically make them yourself), and becausethere's a plethora of books out there meant to supplement (but many are usedto replace) the actual documentation.andP;  But if the practice becomes rampant,it probably won't overwhelm the legal system, because companies can simplyreturn to the bad old days of copy protection--and nobody wants that.andM;In the end, the only proper way to &quot;clear your name&quot; is to delete all thesoftware that you are not licensed to hold from your disk.andP;  What would you doif someone gave you a stolen TV set?andM;MORE QUICKEN CHECKSandM;Your advice in the April 10, 1990, issue on sources for compatible checks forQuicken check-writing software was incomplete.andP;  In addition to the twocompanies you mentioned, there is also Moore Business Products (701 WoodlandsPkwy., P.O. Box 5000, Vernon Hills, IL 60061; (800) 323-6230).andP;  The price forstandard one-part checks is as competitive as the other two companies youmentioned, and the checks are available in a variety of color combinations atno extra cost.andM;Kevin Allen Product Manager Moore Business ProductsandM;At $56.20 for the checks and $27.30 for the envelopes for a total of $83.50,Moore also slides in below Intuit's $92.90, along with Nebs' $79.90 andDeluxe's $88.65.andP;  Thanks for the information.andM;ASK THE ADVISORandM;Send your questions to Advisor, PC Magazine, One Park Avenue, New York, NY10016, or upload to PC MagNet (see &quot;By Modem&quot; sidebar in the Utilities columnfor access information).andP;  Please specify your equipment.andP;  Unfortunately,personal replies are not possible.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
