(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A healthy Galileo spacecraft spedunerringly toward distant Jupiter on Thursday, while the fiveorbiting astronauts who released it measured the threatened ozonelayer that is Earth's natural sunscreen.   Racing along at more than 9,000 mph, the probe Thursday nightwas more than 260,000 miles out on its 2.4-billion-mile, six-yearjourney to study the largest planet in the solar system in a searchfor clues to how the universe began.   Galileo was dispatched from Atlantis' cargo bay Wednesday night,6{ hours after the shuttle was launched from Cape Canaveral.National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials reportedThursday the craft was in ``perfect shape'' and ``right on course.''   Atlantis also was pronounced in ``excellent condition'' byMission Control after the crew members successfully restored acooling system that shut down Wednesday when it overheated and cutin a backup unit.   On Thursday, a major solar flare hurled a surge of radiationtoward Earth, but NASA officials said they were not concerned.   Government scientists said the flare may disrupt communicationsand electrical power transmission over the next two days, but NASAsaid it had been evaluated and was not considered a problem for theastronauts.   ``In the orbit we're in, at 160-mile altitude, it is no threatat all,'' said flight director Ronald D. Dittemore.   The burst also has had no impact on Galileo, which is ``builtfor much harsher environments than a solar flare,'' said NASAspokeswoman Paula Cleggett-Haleim.   Earlier Thursday, Mission Control wakened the space travelerswith a musical tribute to Atlantis commander Don Williams and pilotMike McCulley, both naval aviators and graduates of PurdueUniversity.   Played were ``Hail Purdue'' and ``Anchors Aweigh,'' withreveille sandwiched in between.   The other crew members are Ellen Baker, Franklin Chang-Diaz andShannon Lucid.   They began a series of medical, materials processing and otherexperiments that will occupy their time until they return to Earthon Monday. Landing is scheduled for Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.,at 2:38 p.m. EDT Monday.   On NASA satellite television Thursday night, Chang-Diaz and Mrs.Baker demonstrated a retinal photography test on the shuttle'smiddeck.   With swimming goggles strapped around her head, Mrs. Bakersteadied herself while Chang-Diaz pressed a camera to the rightgoggle to photograph her retina.   Researchers said the camera slides should help them determine ifthere are any changes in the eye's vessels in zero gravity. Suchchanges could indicate some brain swelling, and researchers want todetermine if that is related to motion sickness in space.   A new shuttle experiment used a sensitive instrument in thecargo bay to measure sections of the Earth's ozone layer, an areaof the upper atmosphere that protects our planet from most of thesun's ultraviolet radiation.   There is global concern over depletion of the ozone layer, andmany people fear its destruction will cause a rise in such humanhealth problems as skin cancer.   The information gathered by the Atlantis crew will be comparedwith data being collected at the same time and over the same areasby nearly identical sensors aboard three older U.S. satellites.   Researchers want the new data so they can accurately calibratethe satellite sensors. NASA considers the experiment so importantthat it has scheduled it for six more shuttle flights.   ``Accurate, reliable measurements from space are critical to thedetection of ozone trends and for assessing the potential effectsand development of corrective measures,'' the agency said.   Scientists report the ozone shield has thinned out worldwide byabout 3 percent within the last two decades, with the largestlosses occurring over the polar regions.   The depletion is thought to be increased by the interaction ofcertain manmade chemicals, principally chlorofluorocarbons, orCFCs, used as refrigerants and in the manufacturing of some plasticproducts.   Some U.S. manufacturers and users of CFCs have announced plansto stop making the chemical or to guard against releasing it intothe atmosphere.   Galileo, which slowed from its initial earth-escape velocity ofmore than 25,000 mph, has a long way to go on its odyssey that willtake it on a scenic route through the solar system. Its path willwhip it once past Venus, twice around the Earth and within view ofan asteroid before it reaches Jupiter in December 1995.   The roundabout route is necessary for the 6,000-pound spacecraftto use the gravity forces of Venus and Earth to gain enough speedto reach its target.   Once at Jupiter, Galileo will fire a probe into the Jovianatmosphere and then orbit the planet for a planned 22-month study.   Scientists believe the probe could reveal much about the birthof the universe.   Because Jupiter has apparently undergone little change from itsbeginnings, its composition is thought to resemble the cloud of gasand dust from which the sun and planets formed. Galileo'sobservations could give scientists a better idea of what the earlysolar system looked like when it formed 4.6 billion years ago.   Similarly, the Jovian atmosphere's hydrogen-to-helium ratiopromises to be a vital clue to the validity of the big-bang theory,which holds that the universe was created in a single explosivemoment more than 15 billion years ago. The ratio is thought to beabout the same as was created at the time of the big bang.</TEXT></DOC>
