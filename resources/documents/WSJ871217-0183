Britoil shares were quoted late yesterday on London's stock exchange at 406 pence ($7.43), up 14 pence (26 cents) from Tuesday. As expected, BP's tender offer for Britoil shares at 300 pence each failed; the offer was frustrated, after it opened last week, when Atlantic Richfield Co. of the U.S. said it would pay 350 pence a share for a stake in the company.    Many analysts and investment bankers expect BP to make a higher offer for Britoil, but BP yesterday declined comment. BP's tender offer, which sought to raise its 14.9% stake in Britoil to 29.9%, was widely assumed to be a prelude to a full bid. Yesterday's share price values Britoil at about #2 billion ($3.66 billion).    Arco said last week that it intended to acquire a 29.9% stake in Britoil, and then raise its stake to 49.9% through an exchange of assets for new Britoil shares. Analysts and investment bankers said Salomon Inc., which has acted for Arco in the past, was a buyer of Britoil shares in London yesterday, prompting speculation that Arco was seeking to raise the 7.7% stake it acquired last week. Salomon declined comment.    Under British takeover rules, BP and Arco must make a full bid if they buy 30% or more of Britoil. Arco has indicated it would consider a full bid for Britoil if BP makes one. But both companies face uncertainty because of the British government, which through a so-called golden share in the formerly state-owned Britoil can block a change of control.    ---   Kuwaiti BP Stake Tops 15%   LONDON -- The Kuwait Investment Office increased its stake in British Petroleum Co. to 15.02% from 13.07%, sowing some doubts about its intentions.    The investment-management arm of the Mideastern oil-producing country said it has acquired an additional 116.25 million partly paid BP shares, bringing its total holding to 895.75 million shares. The BP shares traded late yesterday at 70.5 pence ($1.29) each, down half a penny, on London's stock exchange. At that level, the KIO's total BP holding is valued at #631.5 million ($1.16 billion).    The KIO has said it intends its BP interest as a long-term investment. But analysts said that exceeding the 15% level may indicate a desire to take a more instrumental role at BP. &quot;Obviously that's more of a possibility,&quot; said Jeremy Elden, an analyst at the London stockbrokerage Phillips andamp; Drew. However, Mr. Elden said it is too early to tell whether the KIO has changed its intentions. The KIO declined to comment yesterday on its stake. </TEXT></DOC>
