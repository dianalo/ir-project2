All of the patientswith meningomyelocele underwent surgery soon after birth for closureof the skin defect. Whenever possible, examination was not confined tothe lumbosacral area but also included the brain and other portions ofthe spinal cord. Certain similarities and differences in pathology wereascertained in the two groups. The tethered cords were the same in bothgroups. However, Chiari malformations were observed only in patientswith meningomyelocele, and hydrocephalus occurred only in patients withChiari malformations. Syringomyelia and scoliosis were detected in bothgroups, but scoliosis was more prevalent in the meningomyelocele group.There appeared to be a correlation between scoliosis and syringomyelia;in five of the seven cases of syringomyelia, the locations of the scoliosisand syringomyelia were the same. With MRI, these complex pathologies,including tethered cord, syringomyelia, scoliosis, Chiari malformations,and hydrocephalus, were easily visualized. The superiority of MRI overconventional X-ray technology has been well established. First, a directimage of the spinal cord is obtained. Second, there is no necessity forinjection of contrast material into the intrathecal space. Third, anyscanning field is possible. There are also some disadvantages with MRI.First, the spatial resolution is inferior to that of high-resolutioncomputed tomography. Second, MRI cannot provide information concerningbone cortex. Therefore, bone involvement cannot be accurately diagnosed.However, in the assessment of spinal dysraphism, MRI is an excellentdiagnostic tool and should be the preferred method of diagnosing spinaldysraphism.</TEXT></DOC>
