<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-46-1120 </DOCNO><TEXT>The program is aimed at development and utilization of common data baseintegrating publications on nuclear and non-nuclear energy technologiesby member countries of the International Energy Agency (IEA). IEA wasestablished in 1974 under the Organization for Economic Co-operationand Development (OECD). The program covers fossil fuels, recyclable energysources, nuclear fission energy, nuclear fusion energy, energy storage-conversion,end use techniques, advanced energy systems and energy policies in theareas of chemistry, engineering, environmental science, biomedicine,physics, mathematics, computer science, materials and instrumentationrelated with both nuclear and non-nuclear energy technology development.The Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) of the U.S.Department of Energy (DOE), which already has established DOE-EDB (energydata base), will be in charge of its management and provide on-line servicefor retrieval of information from the above data base and IEA-CDB (commondata base) to be constructed under the present program. The member countriesshould send data on publications (recorded on magnetic tape) to OSTIonce or twice a month and provide OSTI with a prescribed amount of funds.In Japan, the New Energy Development Organization and the Japan AtomicEnergy Research Institute are in charge of practical operations in non-nulcearand nuclear areas, respectively.
