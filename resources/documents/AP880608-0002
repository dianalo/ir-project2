Delegates agreed at the monthlong conference that ended last weekto lift a ban on development of Antarctica. The 100-page document,called the Antarctic Minerals Convention, also expressed concern forthe Antarctic environment and contained provisions for itsprotection.   Chris Beeby, New Zealand's deputy secretary of foreign affairsand chairman of the 20-nation group which approved the documentThursday, said it offered the strongest protection possible for theunspoiled Antarctic environment.   However, Greenpeace and other non-governmental groups included inthe discussions claimed they were inadequate.   The convention's provisions include creating an Antarcticminerals resource commission to oversee the region's development.   The United States, which was represented at the meeting,estimates there are 48 billion barrels of offshore petroleumreserves.   The convention also contains provisions for clean-up operationswhere necessary, must now be ratified by a minimum of 16 of theAntarctic Treaty's 20 members, including the seven which have landclaims in Antarctica.   Beeby predicted the convention ``will go down in Antarctichistory as the most important political development regarding theregulation of Antarctica since the Antarctic treaty itself wasadopted in 1959.''   Conservationists, who pushed to have the region protected as a``world park,'' disagreed.   Greenpeace spokesman Roger Wilson said the agreement was reachedonly by ``bludgeoning'' environmentally minded nations intosubmission.   Wilson said the convention looked good on paper but would notprotect the environment in practice.   Beeby said he did not think exploitation of resources will beginsoon.   A moratorium on mineral development has existed since 1977 andwill remain until the convention is ratified, delegates said.   Antarctica is double the size of the United States. Countrieswith land claims are Australia, Britain, New Zealand, Chile, Norway,Argentina and France.</TEXT></DOC>
