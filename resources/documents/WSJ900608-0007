It is important thatthe West not lose interest as these incipient democracies nowtake up the hard part. For Czechoslovakia, that begins thisweekend as citizens go to the polls for the first freeelection in 42 years.   The country's new Parliament will be drafting aconstitution, an undertaking no less important than the taskthat confronted the Founders of the United States 200 yearsago. This will be the fifth version of the country'sconstitution since the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moraviaunited with Slovakia in 1918. The current squabbling betweenthe country's Czechs and Slovaks reflects an identity crisisthat has haunted Czechoslovakia throughout its history.</LP><TEXT>   The internal divisions among the 10 million Czechs, fivemillion Slovaks plus Hungarian, German, Polish, Ruthenian andRomany nationalities have made the country easy prey toexternal and internal predators. The Slovaks have felt allalong that the dominant Czechs reneged on a promise of Slovakautonomy. But it wasn't until about the 20th birthday ofCzechoslovakia before Slovaks could find someone to take uptheir cause. The tragedy was that that someone turned out tobe Adolf Hitler.   When the &quot;Fuhrer&quot; swooped down on Czechoslovakia in 1938,he renamed the country &quot;Czecho-Slovakia,&quot; with a hyphen and acapital S, the same spelling Slovakian separatists have beendemanding this year. The 1948 communist &quot;coup d'etat&quot; broughtCzechoslovakia under a Stalinist constitution. Perversely,Communist rule had the effect of unifying the country. Thepolitical and cultural liberties of the Czechs were trampledas much as those of the other nationalities. Anti-communismwas a sentiment all groups could support.   But when constitutional tinkering in 1960 eased press andcultural restrictions, the issue of Czech domination of theother nationalities once again caught fire. Jan Carnogursky,one of Slovakia's leading human-rights and religiousactivists, and who emerged from prison as the Novemberrevolution began to unfold, wants Slovakia to apply as aseparate entity for membership to the Common Market. He couldsucceed this weekend in leading his right-wing ChristianDemocratic Party to victory over the Civic Forum's Slovakianaffiliate. Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's current andundoubtedly future president, has been crisscrossing thecountry trying to defuse the issue, but without much success.   Since all parties agree that the country needs to adopt amarket economy, tough issues such as privatization, currencyreform and the development of capital markets rank low in theelectioneering. Despite this promising consensus on economicpolicy, the people responsible for it will need solidpolitical support, not factionalism, if they are to have thecourage to carry through on these reform.   The longer Czechoslovakia remains adrift in itsconstitutional void the greater the danger to all the goodthat it has achieved and to its great future potential.(Voters also go to the polls this weekend in Bulgaria, acountry whose long road to recovery is suggested by the factthat, unique among East European countries today, one stillsees the Soviet flag flying.)   Whether a consensus can be reached in Czechoslovakia onthe sovereignty of the state hinges on the ability ofpolitical leaders at a crucial point in their country'shistory to devise a federal structure that recognizes theauthority of the majority, while it extends to nationalitiescollective political rights sufficient to satisfy them. Suchan extraordinary achievement would be a first in EasternEurope.</TEXT></DOC>
