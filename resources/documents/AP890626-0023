(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Threatening to lock up adults who don'tlock up guns sends a strong message, but police and prosecutorsquestion whether a first-of-its kind bill approved in Florida willprevent accidental shootings.   ``We do feel there will be some difficulty in enforcement sinceit will take a child committing some dreadful act before lawenforcement becomes aware that he or she had access to a weapon,''said Tom Berlinger, director of operations for the Florida Sheriff'sAssociation.   Monroe County State Attorney Kurt Zuelch, president of theFlorida Prosecuting Attorneys Association, also expressed concernthat ``the prevention issue hasn't been totally dealt with.''   Accidental shootings that killed three children since June 5prompted the Legislature to pass the bill during a special sessionTuesday. Gov. Bob Martinez is expected to sign the measure into lawthis week.   Gun owners who fail to secure loaded weapons in homes orbusinesses could face charges if children ages 15 and younger hurtsomeone with the firearms. The maximum penalty under the bill wouldbe five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.   Lesser penalties would apply if the child brandishes the gun inpublic or threatens others with it.   The bill exempts police officers and military personnel and doesnot apply in cases where the guns were obtained illegally, such as aburglary.   The bill requires gun-shop owners to post a sign explaining thelaw and to give customers a written warning. The measure alsodirects the state Department of Education to develop a gun-safetyeducation program that lawmakers can consider by next spring.   Gun lobbyists were divided in their appraisal of the legislation.   ``What they've got now is a public relations bill,'' said WilliamBerger, a Sarasota resident who has urged passage of a stricterversion of the legislation since March 1987 when his 9-year-oldstepson was accidentally killed by a friend.   Berger was disappointed that the bill filed by Rep. HarryJennings, a retired Army colonel, was ``watered down,'' but saidgetting a weaker version passed was still ``a battle won in that Iknow parents ... went out and bought a padlock.''   Bernard Horn, state legislative director of Handgun Control Inc.in Washington, called the bill a significant victory that wouldquickly save lives.   ``It makes people understand what's expected of them when theykeep a loaded gun in the house with children,'' Horn said.   Gun-shop owners in Florida say locks and safety boxes have gonefrom being overlooked accessories to one of the most sought-afteritems since lawmakers passed the law.   But Richard Gardiner, who directs state and local legislativeaffairs for the National Rifle Association in Washington, said thebill only repeats what is already covered in criminal negligencelaws throughout the country.   ``We don't have any objection with it ... because it doesn'tchange anything,'' he said.   Gardiner said there's no need for the bill anywhere. He said theNRA would look at laws that may be proposed in other statesindividually.   Handgun Control plans to promote the Florida bill as modellegislation around the country, according to Horn. The organizationis chaired by Sarah Brady, wife of President Reagan's PressSecretary Jim Brady, who was shot in the 1981 assassination attempton Reagan.   A call for similar gun-control action was made Friday byWisconsin Lt. Gov. Scott McCallum following a rash of shootings inthat state. Lawmakers from about a dozen states have expressedinterest in Florida's legislation, according to Horn.   ``I'm sure that this is going to be introduced in quite a numberof legislatures,'' Horn said. ``And what's the NRA going to do? Theycan't say, `Oh, it's not a good law for Michigan or Ohio orIllinois' when they agreed to it in Florida.''   Firearms are the fourth leading cause of accidental deaths inchildren under age 16, according to the National Safety Council, aprivate non-profit organization. Automobile accidents, drownings andfires are the top three.</TEXT></DOC>
