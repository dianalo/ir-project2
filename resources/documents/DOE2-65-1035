To project future emissions of the six gases that contributemost to global warming and to estimate the effects of that warming. Theauthor integrated existing simulation models into one structure - theModel of Warming Commitment. Basing the authors' analysis on four policyscenarios ranging from business-as-usual to strong, timely intervention,he demonstrates that policymakers can significantly diminish the build-upof greenhouse gases if they act soon.</TEXT></DOC>
