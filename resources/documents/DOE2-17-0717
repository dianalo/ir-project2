Describes present possibilities and automation requirementsof individual plant sections. A concept for an automated run-of-minecoal preparation station with a process simulation model is shown. Inregard to heavy media separation, further development consists in introductionof microprocessor controllers and electro-pneumatic transducers. Blockdiagrams of automated cleaning in heavy media, in jigs, and in flotationprocesses as well as a control system for radial slurry separators aregiven. New automation equipment now available and problems that remainto be solved before full automation is rendered possible are reviewed.11 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
