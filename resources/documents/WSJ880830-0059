A spokesman for General Instrument, which makes cable-television electronics and satellite and other electronic systems, said the unit was profitable and had sales of about $50 million in the fiscal year ended Feb. 29. The unit has facilities in St. Louis, Belgium, Mexico and Taiwan.    The spokesman said a sale is expected by year's end. &quot;A couple of negotiations are going on,&quot; he said, but he declined to name the parties.    General Instrument is selling the unit to concentrate on its electronic-communications systems, the spokesman said. Clare makes electrical switches, relays and surge arresters.    &quot;We are proceeding on the basis that the potential buyers have indicated their intent to continue the business as a going concern with existing division management participation,&quot; said Frank G. Hickey, General Instrument's chairman and chief executive officer.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, General Instrument closed at $28.875, up 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
