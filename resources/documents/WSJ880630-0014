Traders cited a perceived split among central banks -- with Japan and the U.S. thought to be less averse to a higher dollar than the Europeans -- as fueling the market's willingness to test the U.S. currency's upper limits.    In late New York trading, the dollar was unchanged at 1.8215 West German marks. The dollar also climbed marginally to 132.80 yen from 132.50 yen a day earlier. The British pound rose to $1.7135 from $1.7091 on Tuesday.    In early trading in Tokyo, the dollar softened to about 132.35 yen.    All eyes today will be focused on West Germany to see if the Bundesbank raises its discount rate by half a percentage point, to 3%, as many expect. A big question in the market, said traders, is how much European central banks will attempt to supplant their recent intervention with increases in official interest rates and how effective those measures will be.    While some traders say they believe such a boost is already discounted in the market, others say a rate increase by West Germany -- and possibly other European countries -- could signal whether central banks are eager to halt the dollar's rise or just temper it.    Noting that the market remains wary of the central banks, Jack Kessler, head of New York foreign-exchange operations for Chase Manhattan Bank, said: &quot;The key question is: Have the central banks been in to push the dollar down or smooth trading out?&quot;    Yesterday's activity was punctuated by a combination of actual European central bank intervention, rumors of U.S. and Japanese intervention and seemingly conflicting statements by senior Japanese monetary officials.    During Tokyo trading early Wednesday, the dollar topped 133 yen on news reports that Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japanese authorities didn't feel current currency fluctuations required immediate action. The comment was similar to one he made Tuesday. However, at a subsequent news conference, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank was prepared to take &quot;appropriate&quot; action, if needed, to stem the dollar's climb. &quot;We will act flexibly if the situation necessitates,&quot; he said.    Nonetheless, the central-bank chief added that the recent appreciation of the U.S. currency was more or less a product of speculation and that chances of its continued ascent were slim.    Japanese monetary officials are known to be concerned about the inflationary pressures associated with their falling currency, high money-supply growth and booming economy. They are also concerned about rising world commodity prices. Yet Mr. Sumita said such pressures were under control and that prices in Japan remained stable because of the yen's appreciation during the past 2 1/2 years.    Dealers said the central banks of West Germany, Switzerland, Italy and the Netherlands intervened during European trading, selling dollars against their own currencies, when the U.S. currency was trading slightly above the 1.8200-mark level. But traders said the amounts were moderate and didn't have a lasting impact.    &quot;The Swiss National Bank and the Bundesbank were active. . . but they weren't that successful,&quot; said Graham Broyd, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Traders will &quot;still take on central banks because they don't believe the central banks have coordinated their actions.&quot;    After European trading had finished, dealers in New York pushed the dollar higher. At one point in the day, the dollar rose to 134.05 yen, its highest level against the Japanese currency since late last November. It also climbed to an intraday peak of 1.8330 marks, an 8 1/2-month high.    After reaching those levels in late morning and early afternoon activity in New York, the dollar quickly fell back a pfennig and one yen on rumors that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Bank of Japan were selling dollars, said dealers.    But &quot;the dollar went back up when people saw nobody (in the market) selling dollars,&quot; said Victor M. Polce, a vice president at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.    While the Fed did sell small amounts of dollars on Monday and Tuesday, U.S. authorities have indicated their cooperation is more symbolic than substantive and have made it clear that for now, they aren't willing to intervene on a large scale to stop the U.S. currency's rise. A stronger dollar helps the Fed fight inflation expectations at home. Moreover, Fed officials fear that large dollar sales would increase liquidity in the U.S. and call into question their resolve to battle inflation.    Most traders said the perception that the Bank of Japan would tolerate a higher dollar has limited the effectiveness of the European central banks' actions. They said that without intervention by the Bank of Japan and a more convincing show of force by the Fed, markets will continue to push the dollar higher.    &quot;The dollar is still well bid; it has been for the last week and a half,&quot; said Mr. Kessler of Chase Manhattan. Supporting the U.S. currency, he said, were the combination of relatively high U.S. interest rates, generally good U.S. economic growth and recent improvement in the U.S. trade deficit.    Other traders pointed to a perception that the so-called Group of Seven industrial nations -- West Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada, and especially the U.S. and Japan -- were willing to tolerate a stronger dollar. In addition, they said the market was testing the &quot;dollar's upside,&quot; because that seemed more vulnerable to movement than trying to push it lower.    Mr. Polce of Bear Stearns predicted the dollar would top 1.8500 marks and 135 yen in the next two weeks and reach as high as 1.90 marks and 138 yen by the end of the summer.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for July delivery settled at $435.70 an ounce, down $2.30. Estimated volume was a high six million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $436.35 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Wednesday, June 29, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
