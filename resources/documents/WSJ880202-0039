Chairman William C. Norris's penchant for shoveling company cash at social welfare projects was widely criticized while he was in charge. Now Control Data is handing him nearly $9 million to do the same thing on his own time.    The company said its directors recently approved a one-time cash contribution of $8.96 million -- which represents nearly half of Control Data's 1987 earnings -- to establish the William C. Norris Institute. The expenditure was included in &quot;restructuring&quot; expenses, a spokesman said.    Though Mr. Norris said directors applauded making the contribution, a company source said it set off grumbling among operating managers seeking more financing for their own projects.    In an interview, Mr. Norris, 76 years old, said his nonprofit organization would &quot;address unmet or poorly met societal needs,&quot; including computer-aided education, advanced manufacturing capability for small business, and tracking technology transfer between the U.S. and Japan.    When Mr. Norris was at Control Data's helm, such efforts were criticized within the company and by Wall Street as diversionary. Mr. Norris, who founded Control Data, retired in early 1986 amid a drastic restructuring to staunch heavy losses. At the time, he signed a five-year, $1.5 million consulting contract with the corporation. The new institute will be housed in a company-owned building. </TEXT></DOC>
