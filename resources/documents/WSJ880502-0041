Karene Witcher (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST </CO><IN> TNM </IN><DATELINE> SYDNEY, Australia  </DATELINE><TEXT>   October's stock-market crash finally caught up with Robert Holmes a Court, removing Australia's best-known corporate raider from the ranks of the world's most influential financiers, at least for now.    Mr. Holmes a Court, who has been struggling to rebound from the beating he and his companies took in the market's plunge, announced last Friday the sale of most of his stake in Bell Group Ltd., the core of his corporate empire.    &quot;It's the end of an era,&quot; said veteran Holmes a Court watcher Tony Moody of Melbourne broker A.C. Goode andamp; Co. &quot;It seems to signal his departure from the whole investment scene.&quot;    Among Mr. Holmes a Court's more notable forays in recent years were the building of a 10% stake in Texaco Inc., sold after the market's crash to raise cash, and unsuccessful efforts to acquire Broken Hill Proprietary Co., a steel and mining concern that is Australia's largest company. His raids succeeded often enough to build Bell Group's assets to six billion Australian dollars ($4.55 billion) at their peak.    His inability to recover from October's market plunge was traced to a hostile bid from two rival financiers for Bell Resources Ltd., which is controlled by Bell Group. The bid forced Mr. Holmes a Court to call off a proposed merger of the Bell companies. &quot;That was the turning point,&quot; said Darryl Smalley, a director at the Perth brokerage Hartley Poynton Ltd.    Mr. Holmes a Court had been depending on the merger, which would have netted him at least 120 million dollars ($91 million), to bail him out of his personal financial problems and put him back on the international takeover trail.    While some analysts reasoned that Mr. Holmes a Court saw no other way out of his personal financial morass, others believe he stepped aside partly for less tangible reasons. &quot;He's been battered,&quot; said one broker. &quot;He needs to recharge his batteries.&quot;    Several analysts said the corporate world hasn't seen the last of Mr. Holmes a Court, but even those who expect him to re-emerge believe it will be difficult for him to become as formidable a force as he was during the heyday of the bull market.    &quot;He'll never be able to do it on the scale of the past,&quot; said Nestor Hinzack, a director of Sydney brokerage Ord Minnett Ltd.    Mr. Holmes a Court sold 39.9% of Bell Group for more than 330 million dollars, leaving him with 6% of the company's shares. He will remain chairman and chief executive of Bell Group, but most analysts believe this is a temporary measure until the company's future is decided.    The transaction passed control of Bell Group to Alan Bond, another Australian corporate raider, whose Bond Corp. bought a 19.9% stake from Mr. Holmes a Court for 2.70 dollars ($2.05) a share, or about 170 million dollars.    At the least, Mr. Bond is likely to run Bell Group in a much different style, and several analysts believe he is likely to restructure the company, selling some assets and shifting others into Bond companies, moves shareholders would have to approve.    The State Government Insurance Commission of Western Australia also bought a 19.9% stake in Bell Group, paying 2.50 dollars a share, or 160.2 million dollars. The commission doesn't plan to take a role in managing Bell Group.    Both investors paid a big premium for Bell Group's shares, which fell two cents Friday to 1.70 dollars. Rumors about the sale circulated late last week, but full details weren't known until after the close of trading Friday.    Bell Group's holdings include a 43% stake in Bell Resources, which in turn holds about 11% of Broken Hill. Bell Group also holds, among other assets, a 15% stake in Standard Chartered PLC, the London banking group.    Bell Resources is currently the target of a joint takeover bid by Sir Ronald Brierley, New Zealand's most famous corporate raider, and Australian publisher Kerry Packer, who since October has replaced Mr. Holmes a Court as Australia's richest man. </TEXT></DOC>
