The 75-member company is one of the Soviet Union's greatestcultural gifts, founded in the early 1940s by Nina Ramishvili andher late husband. Their son, Rengiz Sukhishvili, is artisticdirector. Mother and son choreograph, keeping many regionaltraditions intact, such as keeping couples apart when they dancetogether.   The airborne antics of the male dancers were dazzling and superbTuesday night. Jumping two feet in the air, they tucked in theirfeet to do fast double turns, flying to a landing on their kneesand calves.   The men wore knee pads, which certainly were needed for some ofthe other moves they so easily made. Four adolescent boysdemonstrated their dexterity by whirling around the floor withtheir weight on their knees.   The men also were adept at dancing on their toes in somemovements.   In ``Khorumi,'' a dance in which locations for battle arescouted, one dancer jumped on the shoulders of another to scan theterritory. It was highly effective.   Anyone who thinks all Eastern European dance companies lookalike will decide differently on seeing the Georgian Dancers. Thereare no colorful flying hair ribbons for the women or red embroideryon dirndl skirts.   The women are garbed elegantly for every dance. In several theylook like a flock of brides. In one, where three made a triangledancing back to back, they're dressed more regally.   Also, unlike many Eastern European dance steps which involvehopping, the women in this company do more of a gliding step.   The emphasis is on smoothness and patterns.   Costumes, muted but not dull, were beautifully coordinated.Simon Virsaladze, who designs for the Bolshoi Ballet, is said tohave used the heritage of the Georgian region in the costumes. Themen's costumes favored military coats worn with swords over blackpants.   The company, on a 12-week U.S. tour, will appear on Broadwaythrough Sept. 4. It will then go to Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Trenton andAtlantic City, N.J., and Orlando, Daytona, Sarasota and Clearwater,Fla.   James M. Nederlander, in association with Classical ArtistsInternational, produced the Broadway season.</TEXT></DOC>
