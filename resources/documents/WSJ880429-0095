The budget matches the defense spending level hammered out in last year's budget summit. A version being debated on the House floor also matches the budget agreement, but contains different funding levels for individual programs. The Senate panel, concerned about a Soviet advantage in conventional weapons in Europe, beefed up funding for tanks and anti-tank systems, and chopped outlays for certain nuclear systems. Many programs, including the Trident submarine and its D-5 missile, went unchanged from the administration's proposal.    In a cost-cutting move, the budget bill would launch a plan making it easier for the defense secretary to eliminate unnecessary domestic military bases.    The Senate panel authorized the purchase of 58 General Dynamics Corp. M-1 tanks on top of the 545 sought by the Pentagon, along with funds to develop high-velocity missiles to penetrate enemy tanks. The budget for another Army staple, the McDonnell Douglas Corp. AH-64 helicopter, was increased to $853 million from the requested $773 million.    The committee cut research money for the Strategic Defense Initiative to $4.3 billion from the proposed $4.5 billion. It also voted to push the Midgetman missile closer to extinction by chopping proposed funding for fiscal 1989 to $50 million from $200 million. Late last year, the Pentagon suggested killing the mobile nuclear missile altogether, but under pressure from House supporters of the weapon, agreed to seek $200 million for it.    But the Senate panel also cut $93 million from a nuclear missile program the Pentagon vigorously supports -- the rail-car MX missile. The committee cuts would bring spending authority for the project to $700 million.    The committee chopped the proposed funding for General Dynamics F-16 fighter jets to $2.5 billion from the proposed $2.8 billion.    The Senate panel found further savings by postponing procurement of the Army's air-defense system and by blocking the Navy request to spend $53 million on a proposed home port in Everett, Wash. The home-port plan has encountered staunch resistance in Everett for environmental reasons and may remain stalled indefinitely.    The Senate action came as the full House was preparing to vote on program funding levels in its version of the $299.5 billion budget for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.    Both chambers are expected to set in motion a plan to eliminate one often-identified source of military waste -- dozens of unnecessary bases in the U.S. that lawmakers protect because they provide jobs and revenues in their home districts. A provision likely to be part of both bills would set up a bipartisan commission to draw up a list of unnecessary bases; if the defense secretary approves the list, all would be eliminated under streamlined procedures. </TEXT></DOC>
