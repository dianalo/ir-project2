Approval of a 100-page document called the Antarctic MineralsConvention came despite the objections of environmentalists at amonthlong conference that ended last week.   Chris Beeby, New Zealand's deputy secretary of foreign affairsand chairman of the conference, said the convention, approvedThursday, offers the strongest protection possible for theunspoiled Antarctic environment.   But the environmental group Greenpeace and othernon-governmental groups included in the discussions called theenvironmental safeguards inadequate.   The convention's provisions include creating an Antarcticminerals resource commission to oversee the region's development.   The United States, which was represented at the meeting,estimates there are 48 billion barrels of offshore petroleumreserves.   The convention must now be ratified by a minimum of 16 of theAntarctic Treaty's 20 members, including the seven with land claimsin Antarctica, before it would take effect.   Beeby predicted the convention ``will go down in Antarctichistory as the most important political development regarding theregulation of Antarctica since the Antarctic treaty itself wasadopted in 1959.'' The treaty regulates activities in Antarctica.   Conservationists, who pushed to have the region protected as a``world park,'' disagreed.   Greenpeace spokesman Roger Wilson said the agreement was reachedonly by ``bludgeoning'' environmentally minded nations intosubmission.   He said the convention looked good on paper but would notprotect the environment in practice.   Beeby said he did not think exploitation of resources will beginsoon.   A moratorium on mineral development has existed since 1977 andwill remain until the convention is ratified, delegates said.   Antarctica is double the size of the United States. Countrieswith land claims are Australia, Britain, New Zealand, Chile,Norway, Argentina and France.</TEXT></DOC>
