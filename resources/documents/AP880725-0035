We're going toclean up the police force,'' Attorney General Sergio Garcia Ramirezsaid during a visit to this city on the U.S. border to initiate aninvestigation into the shootings.   Linda Bejarano, 28, co-anchor for XHIJ-TV of Juarez; hermother-in-law, Lucrecia Martinez de Gomez, 58; and family friendCarlos Alfonso Garcia, 25, were gunned down in their car about 3a.m. Saturday by men identifying themselves as Federal JudicialPolice, officials said.   Ms. Bejarano's husband and co-anchor, Manuel Gomez, was in thecar but escaped injury by lying on the floor.   A Federal Judicial Police officer and three officers on the citypolice force were arrested, according to Notimex, Mexico'sgovernment news agency.   Garcia said the three were ``madrinas,'' underlings who workillegally for members of the elite federal force.   Though illegal, the use of madrinas reportedly is widespread inJuarez. The ``officers,'' lured by the chance to work with Mexico'shighest police agency and carry automatic weapons, often havelittle or no training.   City police Chief Fernando Motta Allen later denied the threewere on the city police force.   If an investigation determines the three are not commissionedofficers, they will face charges of usurpation of police powers aswell as of homicide, District Attorney Alberto Salinas said Sunday.   Garcia suspended the chief of the Juarez Federal Judicial Policepending an investigation, and said he wanted the use of madrinas toend.   ``I am absolutely against that corrupt and dishonest practice,''he said. ``My indignation is great. ...   ``The bad elements (in the federal force) will be removed. Thereare good elements in the force, ones who devote their lives to it.That isn't the case in this instance. But the bad agents will beremoved. We won't let this blow over.''   Carlos Armendariz, acting head of the Juarez detachment of thefederal police, said the four detainees mistook the victims' carfor one involved in a police shootout two hours earlier on ahighway south of Juarez.   Occupants of the first car were suspected of being drugtraffickers. Police said they found the abandoned car Saturdayafternoon in Juarez, with bullet holes in the rear window and morethan 80 pounds of cocaine stashed in the trunk. There were noarrests.   Gomez said he, his wife and the two others were returning from abirthday party when men identifying themselves as Federal JudicialPolice shouted to him to pull over. He said he didn't because hewas afraid the men would search his car and steal $12,000 cash hehad just collected for doing publicity for a traveling circus.   In the last six years, there have been more than 20 unsolvedkillings of Mexican journalists. Journalistic groups allege thatsome of the reporters were killed in revenge for their work or tosilence them.   But reporters at XHIJ said neither Gomez nor Ms. Berajano wereknown for exposing drug traffickers or government corruption.   Gomez met with Juarez reporters Sunday night and asked them tosupport his efforts to seek justice. He said he feared for his twodaughters and himself because he believed at least one gunmanremained free.   ``I want to ask you to help me to demand that they not permitthis (deed) to be forgotten,'' he said.   The three deaths prompted Chihuahua Gov. Fernando Baeza to buyadvertisements of sympathy in Sunday's Juarez newspapers.   At the funeral home where the bodies of Ms. Bejarano and Ms.Martinez lay, hundreds of mourners streamed in all day Sunday. Morethan 40 large wreaths lined the walls of the viewing chapel.</TEXT></DOC>
