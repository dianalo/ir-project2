Data included are the radiation induced change of properties suchas kinematic viscosity, total acid number, flash point, pour point, specificgravity and color, and the results by instrumental analysis such as gasanalysis by gas chromatography, ESR spectra, infrared spectra, mass spectra,and molecular weight distribution by liquid chromatography. Twenty-sevendifferent kinds of commercial lubricating oils including mineral oils,a synthetic hydrocarbon oil, ester lubricants, a polyether, siliconeoils, florinated oils and aromatic oils were irradiated with /sup 60/Co{gamma}-rays at room temperature in a vacuum, in air and under bubblingoxygen. The irradiation was carried out up to 30 MGy at a dose rate of10 kGy/h.</TEXT></DOC>
