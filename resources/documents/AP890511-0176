Palestinians staged a general strike in the occupied territoriesto mourn the 471 Arabs killed in the 17-month uprising againstIsraeli rule. Twenty-one Israelis also have been killed.   In Bethlehem, activists blocked roads with rocks, hung outlawedPalestinian flags from electricity poles, and covered walls withgraffiti saying ``No to Shamir's Elections!''   Government officials said Israel's coalition government remainssplit on party lines about how to conduct elections in the occupiedWest Bank and Gaza Strip, despite U.S. pressure for a detailedproposal.   In southern Israel, hundreds of people waving anti-Arab bannersand Israeli flags marched near the port city of Ashkelon to protestthe slaying of an army sergeant and the disappearance of a secondsoldier.   Demonstrators stoned several Arab-owned cars, and at one pointmenaced two terrified Arab pedestrians who were rescued by police.   ``We're going to liberate Ashdod and Ashkelon. No Arab will workhere!'' one woman in the crowd yelled, referring to the coastalcities just north of the Gaza Strip.   Both soldiers disappeared in the area, and authorities blameArabs. The slain soldier's body was found last week after he wasmissing almost three months, and the other soldier dissapeared lastweek.   The incidents have sparked anti-Arab outbursts and demands fortougher measures to crush the Palestinian rebellion.   In Ashdod, police detained three Israelis for attacking a storeowner who employed Palestinians, Israel radio said.   Ashdod Mayor Zvi Zilker said the municipality barred 21 Gazamerchants from working at an outdoor market Thursday for fear thattheir presence would spark anti-Arab riots.   He said the town council will meet Sunday to discuss measures toreduce the number of Arabs working in Ashdod. Gazans make up 5percent of the work force in Ashdod and are primarily employed inlow-paying industries and as gardners and street cleaners.   On Thursday, Transport Minister Moshe Katsav of the right-wingLikud bloc demanded that troops seal off the West Bank and GazaStrip for three months, barring Arabs from entering Israel andjournalists from covering the uprising.   The free movement of Palestinians ``has become dangerous. Theyhave kidnapped soldiers and murdered soldiers,'' Katsav said onIsrael army radio.   A Defense Ministry spokesman refused to comment on the proposal.   In the Gaza Strip town of Sheikh Radwan, troops shot and killedan Arab teen-ager in a clash with stone-throwers, Arab reporterssaid.   Arab hospital officials identified the youth as Khalid JadallahJadallah, 17.   In the West Bank town of Hebron, troops fired at stone-throwers,fatally shooting 17-year-old Salmi Ibrahim Abu Kaff in the chest,the army said.   Arab hospital sources reported 16 Palestinians wounded by armygunfire, including 12 in the Gaza Strip where troops enforced acurfew confining 700,000 Palestinians to their homes for a fourthday.   The army said it was checking the casualty reports.   In Jerusalem, police arrested a squad of PLO activists forplanting bombs in Jewish Sabbath bread last October. The bombswounded three girls.   Maariv newspaper quoted senior government officials as sayingthat once the Cabinet approves an election plan, Israel willprepare to hold the balloting even if Palestinians don't agree.   ``Preparations for elections and the decision on who will beentitled to vote and run will be assigned to the office of thecoordinator of activities in the territories,'' Maariv said.   ``The military government will constitute the source ofauthority for autonomy, and will issue a special order for thispurpose,'' it said.   Israel and the United States back elections, and governmentofficials Thursday said U.S. Secretary of State James Baker IIIwrote to Shamir and other Cabinet ministers asking for detailedplans on the proposed vote.   Among points he raised were international supervision ofballoting and the participation of 140,000 Palestinians fromIsraeli-annexed east Jerusalem. Shamir's Likud bloc is opposed tothe east Jerusalemites voting, while its left-leaning coalitionpartner, the Labor Party, is in favor.   The Palestine Liberation Organization and leading Palestiniansin the occupied lands say they will accept elections only as partof a comprehensive peace plan, including an Israeli commitment toexchange land for peace.</TEXT></DOC>
