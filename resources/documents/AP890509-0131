Bonn sparked major infighting with its demand for negotiationson reducing short-range nuclear weapons, saying NATO should take upevery opportunity for talks on disarmament.   The United States and Britain say such talks can be dangerousbecause of the Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventional forces.NATO's short-range nuclear weapons, most of which are in WestGermany, act as a deterrent against possible attacks on allianceforces, they say.   Washington officials say the United States probably would beforced to withdraw its troops from West Germany if the Bonngovernment went so far as to ban short-range nuclear weapons fromits soil.   The feud has led some American observers to wonder whether WestGermany's insistence on pursuing a major internal battle shows aweakness in its commitment to the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization.   But Bonn government officials insist they remain committed tothe Western alliance, and that disarmament negotiations help reducetensions between East and West and present no threat to NATO.   Alfred Dregger, parliamentary leader of Chancellor Helmut Kohl'sChristian Democratic Union, said reducing armaments in Europe ``tothe lowest levels'' would help make it possible for ``East and Westto lose the fear they have of one another.''   ``This is the grand goal that guides us: unity and freedom forall of Germany in a united, free Europe from Poland to Portugal, aEurope that would serve as a peace bridge between the United Statesand the Soviet Union,'' Dregger told parliament Tuesday.   Another Christian Democrat, who asked not to be furtheridentified, said fears that West Germany plans to abandon thealliance stem at least partially from a sharp lack of understandingin the United States of the situation in Europe.   ``We have to do a lot to have a better understanding of what'sgoing on in Europe and in Germany,'' said the official.   ``It is very clear that we Germans are working for commonsecurity in the Western alliance, and on the basis of commonsecurity we are looking for dialogue and better relations with theEast.''   Nevertheless, even some West German political analysts say Kohlmade a colossal error by insisting on a fight with the UnitedStates and Britain over short-range nuclear weapons.   Thomas Ender, a specialist at Bonn's German Institute forForeign Affairs think tank, said he fears Bonn's eagerness toplease voters could seriously damage the alliance.   ``Chancellor Kohl is tempted to confront the United Statesbecause that may please the voters since it makes him lookstrong,'' Ender said in an interview. ``But I am worried this couldlead to a major break within NATO.''   There is a strong anti-military mood in West Germany, a factorwhich apparently prompted Kohl to target short-range nuclearmissiles in the face of predictions he could lose next year'selection.   ``This is a very narrow-minded and dangerous game to be playing.The utmost West German national interest is to keep a strongalliance with the United States'' Ender said.   The conservative newspaper Die Welt on Tuesday echoed Ender'sworry, saying it is a ``serious mistake'' for West Germany toattempt to pit other continental European allies against the UnitedStates and Britain in the missiles dispute.   Kohl's government often claims the support of six continentalEuropean NATO allies in its attempt to persuade Washington andWhitehall of the need for disarmament talks.   Die Welt said ``only time will tell'' whether the NATO feud is``the start of a distancing between North America and WesternEurope, between Britain and the continent.''</TEXT></DOC>
