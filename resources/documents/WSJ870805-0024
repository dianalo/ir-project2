Last month, United, British Airways, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Swissair said they would invest $120 million to build a more sophisticated reservations and information system than the Europeans currently have. The system is expected to be in service by mid-1989. A spokesman for United, a unit of Chicago-based Allegis Corp., said the group's total $120 million investment won't change with the addition of the two carriers. He said each airline's stake hasn't been determined, since the consortium has invited other carriers to join the group. </TEXT></DOC>
