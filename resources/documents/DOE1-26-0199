<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-26-0199 </DOCNO><TEXT>The goal of our spectroscopic work is to &quot;gain sufficient understandingof the entrainer effect so that, ultimately, the optimal solvent andcosolvent can be chosen and solubilities predicted.&quot; Spectroscopic datawill be used to test and improve, where necessary, the accuracy and predictivecapability of APACT (the Associated Perturbed Anisotropic Chain Theory).Our plans are (1) to determine, by FTIR spectroscopy, the extent of hydrogenbonding in liquid and compressed gas mixtures of solvating and associatingfluids, (2) to use phase equilibrium data and the results of our spectroscopicmeasurements to test APACT as a model for Lewis acid/base interactionsin liquid or compressed gas mixtures, (3) to investigate the hypothesisthat CO{sub 2}, as a solvent in compressed gas mixtures, acts as a Lewisacid (or base, depending on the acid/base properties of the other componentsin the mixture). To test this hypothesis, and to provide data to testAPACT, mixtures of a compressed gas, an associating fluid (such as methanol)or a potentially solvating fluid (such as a ketone) will be analyzedfor hydrogen bonding. Further experiments with CO{sub 2} will be planneddepending on the outcome of this first experiment. Liquid spectroscopywill be developed as a technique for obtaining data that can be usedwith APACT calculations to make predictions of the phase behavior andhydrogen bonding tendency of compressed gas mixtures. 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
