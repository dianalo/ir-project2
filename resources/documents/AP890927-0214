Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Valder said Recognition EquipmentInc., its chief executive officer and marketing vice president wereinvolved in a scheme to ``defraud the government by buying'' PeterVoss, a former member of the postal service's board of governors.   The two REI officers are William Moore and Robert Reedy.   In opening statements at the non-jury trial, the prosecutor saidREI paid $325,000 to Detroit-area businessman John Gnau in 1985 andearly 1986 in an attempt to win work with the postal service.   Gnau funneled some of the money to Voss, who as vice chairman ofthe postal board of governors had urged Moore and Reedy to hireGnau as a consultant in the fall of 1984.   REI lawyer Jack Cooney responded that no one at the company knewof the arrangement between Gnau and Voss.   The conspiracy between Voss and Gnau ``was up and running andprofitable before REI was contacted,'' said Cooney. ``REI wasvictimized. REI was one of many companies this conspiracy tried toseduce.''   But Valder said the company ``polluted'' and tried to``capture'' the postal service procurement process, and Moore was``obsessed'' with getting a postal contract for the company.   Moore and Reedy ``cheated ... they lied ... they stole ... theycovered up,'' Valder said.   The charges of conspiracy, theft and fraud are being triedbefore U.S. District Court Judge George Revercomb.   Moore and Reedy participated in an arrangement that has been``around since the beginning of time,'' Valder said. The defendantswere ``trying to buy a government official.''   Valder said Moore's own notes refer to Gnau's firm at one pointby saying, ``consultant wired,'' adjacent to a notation reading,``Peter Voss.''   But the prosecutor acknowledged there will be no evidence thatGnau, Voss or their associates ever specifically told REI or itsofficers of the corrupt arrangement.   ``Valder hangs his case on words like `wired''' which connote noillegality, Cooney said.   Other companies had hired high-profile lobbyists such as formerWhite House political director Lyn Nofziger, Cooney said, and ``alot of people would think those people were wired.''   Voss, who headed Ronald Reagan's 1980 Ohio presidentialcampaign, received a four-year sentence in 1986 after pleadingguilty to taking an illegal gratuity and to expense account fraud.The gratuity from Gnau was in connection with REI's attempt to getpostal service work.   Gnau, who headed Reagan's 1980 Michigan campaign, was sentencedto three years for conspiracy and paying an illegal $2,500 gratuityto Voss.   Both men are expected to testify as government witnesses at thetrial, which could last several months.   Valder said evidence will be presented showing that:   _Reedy asked one of Gnau's business partners, ``Why don't youget Voss to go sole-source?'' by awarding a non-competitivecontract to REI.   _Moore and Reedy worked with Voss through Gnau associate WilliamSpartin to get rid of U.S. postmaster general Paul Carlin andreplace him with someone sympathetic to REI.   _Spartin, under contract with the postal board of governors,asked Moore to suggest replacements and Moore's first choice was AlCasey, who quickly was selected by the board.   But Cooney said a tape recording of the meeting in which Carlinwas fired shows the board of governors voted 6-0 to dismiss himbecause he was a poor manager.</TEXT></DOC>
