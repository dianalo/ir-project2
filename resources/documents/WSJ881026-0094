Do you pamper your skin with &quot;tissue matrix fluid&quot;? Maybe you prefer &quot;bio-proteotone complex.&quot;    Don't expect much help from your dictionary. More and more technical-sounding language is appearing in skin-care advertisements, usually without explanation. Some are actual scientific terms; others are the creation of imaginative marketing officials. Either way, the goal is the same: to portray the products as the latest word in skin care.    Makers of skin-care products concede that consumers may not understand the terms but say they hope to arouse enough curiosity to get people to the sales counter. Some marketers and analysts, however, say the approach only sows confusion.    Of course, jargon and scientific language in skin-care ads aren't new -- words such as &quot;moisturize&quot; and &quot;hypo-allergenic,&quot; both now in Webster's dictionary, were coined on Madison Avenue -- but never has it been so widespread. The trend stems partly from increasing competition: In recent years, dozens of manufacturers have entered the market, making it harder for products to stand out.    The use of technical language has accelerated since a clampdown last year by the Food and Drug Administration on product labeling and advertising. Previously, skin-care companies competed to see which could make the most outrageous anti-aging and cell-restructuring claims. But language that suggests a cosmetic product can enter skin cells and affect cell structure is forbidden because it implies that the product is actually a drug. Early last year, the agency ordered words like &quot;rejuvenate,&quot; &quot;restructure&quot; and &quot;anti-aging&quot; struck from ads and packaging for skin-care products. Despite some resistance to the order, skin-care companies have moved away from anti-aging claims and toward terms that sound scientific but don't offend the FDA.    Thus, Estee Lauder Inc. has stopped talking about Eyzone's ability to promote &quot;oxygen uptake&quot; and instead advertises the lotion's &quot;tissue matrix fluid.&quot; Cosmair Inc., which distributes Lancome and other products in the U.S., has dropped mention of promoting skin's &quot;self-revival&quot; in ads for Lancome's Forte-Vital Firming Creme and now advertises the &quot;bio-proteotone complex&quot; in that product.    Heinz Eiermann, director of the FDA's cosmetics division, says the agency allows such phrases because they don't make implied drug claims. &quot;Some of it is scientific gobbledygook and some is meaningful,&quot; he says. But much gobbledygook is considered simply &quot;puffery&quot; and doesn't violate any rules.    Some people say the ads may help to create a sense of mystery, which can be a selling point. Helen Gurley Brown, editor in chief of Cosmopolitan magazine, concedes that she doesn't understand the advertising, but adds: &quot;The point is, the whole business of using treatment products has to do with a ritual that makes us feel better. I don't see why advertising has to make total sense, because there's a mystique to it. So all these words don't disturb me for a minute.&quot;    But some marketers say the approach may be turning off consumers. &quot;There's a sort of pseudo-science that's built up around beauty care,&quot; says Edward Weiss, marketing director of Packaged Facts, a research firm. &quot;It's effective to a degree, but I think it's getting confusing.&quot;    Allan Mottus, an industry analyst, adds: &quot;The consumer is saying, 'Hey, I'm all messed up. You've created such a clutter that I don't know what to use.' This kind of confusion will lend itself to some pretty negative positions for some lines.&quot;    Cosmair and Estee Lauder decline to comment on the strategy. Officials of Christian Dior Perfumes Inc., which advertises &quot;patented liposomes&quot; and lists patent numbers for the phospholipid molecules in its Capture moisturizer, didn't return calls seeking comment.    Though most of the scientific language comes from upscale manufacturers, some trickles down to mass-market brands. For example, Maybelline Co., a subsidiary of Schering-Plough Corp., recently began promoting its makeup as &quot;non-comedogenic.&quot;    But there are signs that the use of scientific language may be peaking. Avon Products Inc. says focus groups show the average consumer doesn't want any more technical language. So it has returned to an ad strategy of &quot;simplicity and clarity,&quot; says spokeswoman Bernadette Mansur.    Consider Avon's BioAdvance. Two years ago, Ms. Mansur says, ads for BioAdvance promised to &quot;help invigorate the skin's biomatrix.&quot; But now, ads for the product say, &quot;BioAdvance with Retinol,&quot; and, in smaller type, &quot;Featured on nationwide TV news and talk shows.&quot;    Farther down, the ads reveal that &quot;Retinol&quot; is actually Vitamin A -- although it sounds suspiciously like Retin-A, the new, highly publicized prescription drug that can reduce wrinkles. So why not call it Vitamin A in the first place?    &quot;We want to make sure consumers understand that it's not Retin-A,&quot; says Ms. Mansur. </TEXT></DOC>
