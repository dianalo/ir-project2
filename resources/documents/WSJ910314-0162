That's the conclusion of oil ministers, OPEC officials andindustry analysts focusing on the specifics -- or lack ofspecifics -- in the production arrangement reached Tuesday.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It made me wince,&quot; said Michael Rothman, Merrill Lynch andamp;Co.'s senior oil analyst, who was here to observe the OPECmeeting. &quot;It's certainly a loosely worded agreement.&quot;   The cutbacks are intended to reduce OPEC's productionabout one million barrels a day, to 22.3 million a day forthe second quarter, in hope of propping up oil prices asseasonal demand slackens.   &quot;This is neither a ceiling nor quotas,&quot; said Saudi ArabianOil Minister Hisham Nazer. &quot;This is just a production leveldealing with the current situation.&quot;   Industry officials suggested that OPEC is really cuttingproduction 500,000 to 700,000 barrels a day, rather than theannounced one million.   &quot;They're reducing output by about one-half of what they'reclaiming,&quot; according to Lawrence Goldstein, president of thePetroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. &quot;This canhardly be called a cut -- it's more like a seasonal decline.&quot;   Part of the problem is that the production level fromwhich OPEC plans to make its cuts is a phantom number. Thegroup claims it will trim 5% from output of 23.4 millionbarrels a day. But current production is around 23 millionbarrels a day, according to those who monitor OPEC output.   The base level for the percentage cut was calculated fromeach member's average daily production during its peak monthbetween August and February -- and those numbers are,apparently, subject to debate.   Gholamrezah Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, confirmed theamorphous nature of the arrangement. He told a newsconference that Iran's output after its 5% reduction would be3.4 million barrels a day, not 3.2 million as stated on listsbeing circulated informally among delegates. Iran bases itscuts on a February production rate of 3.6 million barrels aday, rather than a lower figure being passed around. TheIranians say they were never officially assigned anyproduction level from which to cut.   It was clear that Iran, Saudi Arabia and several othermajor producers in OPEC will probably continue selling asmuch oil as possible.   Saudi Arabia was scheduled to account for about 400,000barrels a day of the output cuts by setting its ownproduction at eight million barrels a day. But Mr. Nazer saidits contribution will be larger than that, because it &quot;isproducing now about 8.5 million.&quot;   Saudi Arabia, which has been pumping oil on an all-outbasis during the months of the Persian Gulf crisis andmilitary confrontation with Iraq, had been expected to slowits output anyway. Production facilities can't be run at nearcapacity for long periods without running into problems ofmaintenance, oil analysts said. The United Arab Emirates,which has also been pushing huge quantities of oil into themarket, is expected to ease up for similar reasons.   But despite the apparent inconsistencies in the OPECagreement, oil prices may be relatively firm because ofchanging market fundamentals, some analysts say. Globalpetroleum inventories held by oil companies are declining,and although there still is evidence that crude oil suppliesare in surplus, much of the excess is in so-called producerstocks, which include unsold oil stored on tankers.   Saudi Arabia and Iran hold the bulk of the producerinventories. Both Mr. Aghazadeh and Mr. Nazer insisted thatany sales from inventories would be orderly and would be partof their second-quarter production calculations. &quot;Sales offloating stocks will be according to our provisionalproduction level,&quot; Mr. Aghazadeh said.   Also, according to Merrill Lynch's Mr. Rothman, petroleumprices could be supported by anticipation that OPEC ministerswill resolve the production issue when they meet again inearly June. By then, the seasonal period of weak demandshould be nearly over. Supply and demand are expected to betenuously balanced during the second half of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
