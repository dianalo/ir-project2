The proposed $330 million stock offering would trim KKR'sstake in the Bethel, Conn., battery company to 52.5% fromabout 60%. It also signals an increased willingness by KKR,the nation's largest leveraged buy-out firm, to use publicstock offerings to sell off its controlling stakes incompanies acquired in the 1980s takeover boom.</LP><TEXT>   News of the proposed stock offering caused Duracell'sstock to drop as much as $2.125 a share yesterday morning.The stock recovered somewhat, and was quoted in late New YorkStock Exchange composite trading at $27.375 a share, down$1.375 on the day. Duracell, which was taken private in a1988 leveraged buy-out led by KKR, went public at $15 a shareearlier this year, and its stock has soared since then.   Investment bankers said the drop in Duracell's stockyesterday was typical for a company announcing a stockoffering by a major shareholder. First Boston Corp. analystLynne Hyman, who is recommending Duracell stock to clients,said that &quot;the one negative&quot; in the announcement is theprospect of further KKR stock sales. &quot;We don't know when orhow KKR will come to market again,&quot; she said.   The proposed Duracell stock sale, however, was welcomed bysome of the banks and pension funds that participate in KKR'sbuy-out partnerships. These investors share in any profitsrealized by the sale of KKR-controlled stock, and some ofthem in recent months have been encouraging KKR to takeprofits on its successful buy-outs.   &quot;For us, it's always nice to realize a profit,&quot; saidMichael Murray, an executive vice president at ContinentalBank, which participates in KKR buy-out funds. KKR'spartnerships paid $5 a share for Duracell stock in 1988, lessthan one-fifth the current stock price.   Historically, KKR hasn't sold its stakes in companiespiecemeal, preferring to wait until acquirers can be found tobuy 100% of the companies KKR controls. But the buyout firmrecently announced plans to sell an additional 10% of itsholdings in AutoZone Inc., following a successful initialpublic offering in April. And there's speculation that KKR atsome stage may sell more of its largest buy-out investment,RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., which is already publicly traded.   &quot;There's a realization on KKR's part that when you're acontrolling shareholder in some absolutely huge companies,these sorts of offerings are much more preferable than tryingto sell the whole company,&quot; said John Canning, an executiveat First Chicago Corp., which also invests with KKR. &quot;Iwouldn't want to sell all my Duracell shares at this price,&quot;Mr. Canning added, &quot;but it's nice to get some liquidity.&quot;   Duracell said it expects to raise about $138 million fromselling five million new shares in the stock offering.Proceeds from that part of the offering would be used toreduce the company's $897 million of debt, trimming $11million or so a year from annual interest expense.   By year end, First Boston's Ms. Hyman estimates,Duracell's debt could shrink to just 40% of totalcapitalization. That would be an unusually conservativebalance sheet for a KKR-controlled company, and thepossibility has analysts wondering if Duracell will use someof its spare cash flow for dividends, acquisitions or stockrepurchases. Duracell currently doesn't pay dividends on itscommon, but said in its prospectus that it will set adividend policy in 1992.   People familiar with Duracell say KKR partners havedescribed the firm's stake in the company as a &quot;core,long-term holding.&quot; In the offering prospectus, however, KKRis more circumspect. The buy-out firm says only that it won'tsell any more Duracell stock for the next six months.</TEXT></DOC>
