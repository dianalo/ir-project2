Stevens andamp; Co. said an employee stock-ownership plan would own a majority of the company under a $696 million leveraged buy-out being proposed by management.    Separately, at least four Stevens shareholders filed suits in state court in Delaware aimed at blocking the transaction. The suits contend the $43-a-share price -- $38 in cash plus debentures valued at $5 -- is too low.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Stevens closed at $46.75 a share, up 25 cents.    The company said it decided to include an employee stock-ownership plan, or ESOP, in the buy-out &quot;to have our employees participate in the growth of the company.&quot; In addition, use of an ESOP brings tax advantages that would lower the effective cost of financing 15% to 20%, the company said. Such tax benefits have recently made ESOPs an effective tool in corporate acquisitions.    Under the buy-out proposal, a newly created ESOP would borrow an undetermined amount of money to purchase a majority stake in Stevens as the company is taken private, Stevens said. As the debt is paid off, shares being held as collateral would be released to employees. In a leveraged buyout, a company is taken private in a transaction largely financed with borrowings that are repaid with funds generated by company operations or assets sales.    All non-union workers would participate in the ESOP, the company said. Union workers also may participate, but that is subject to negotiation. The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, which represents 3,500 Stevens workers, said it would study the proposal. The company has about 23,000 employees. </TEXT></DOC>
