<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-16-0064 </DOCNO><TEXT>In 1985, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) sought toregulate rail shipments of spent nuclear fuel through the state, becausefederal regulations did not adequately protect the environmentally sensitivecorridor along the route of the shipments. A state interagency workinggroup identified five serious deficiencies in overall federal regulatoryscheme: 1) failure to consider the safety or environmental risks associatedwith selected routes; 2) abscence of route-specific emergency responseplanning; 3) failure of the NRC to regulate the carrier of spent nuclearfuel or consider its safety record; 4) abscence of requirements for determinationof need for, or the propriety of, specific shipments of spent nuclearfuel; and 5) the lack of any opportunity for meaningful public participationwith respect to the decision to transport spent nuclear fuel. Pursuantto Wisconsin's hazardous substance statutes, the WDNR issues an orderrequiring the utility to file a spill prevention and mitigation planor cease shipping through Wisconsin. A state trial court judge upheldthe utility's challenge to Wisconsin's spill plan requirements, basedon federal preemption of state authority. The state is now proposingfederal legislation which would require: 1) NRC determination of needprior to approval of offsite shipment of spent fuel by the licensees;2) NRC assessment of the potential environmental impacts of shipmentsalong the proposed route, and comparative evaluation of alternative modesand routes; and 3) NRC approval of a route-specific emergency responseand mitigation plan, including local training and periodic exercises.Additionally, the proposed legislation would authorize States and IndianTribes to establish regulatory programs providing for permits, inspection,contingency plans for monitoring, containments, cleanup and decontamination,surveillance, enforcement and reasonable fees. 15 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
