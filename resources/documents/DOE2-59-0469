Although a variety of countermeasures have been devised, theaccidents and failures due to human factors still occur. So far, theproblems related to human factors have not been fundamantally and systematicallyinvestigated. Also the data base related to this problem has not beendeveloped. Therefore, the government and electric utility industry beganthe research on the prevention of the accidents caused by human errors.The basic research is carried out by the government, and the appliedresearch is done by electric utility industry. The Central Research Instituteof Electric Power Industry established the Human Factors Research Centeron July 1, 1987. The research program in the Human Factors Research Centeris divided into the basic research to clarity fundamental human characteristics,the systematic research to apply this information and the analyticalresearch on human error experience. These research activities are reported.(Kako, I.).</TEXT></DOC>
