The minutes of the March 29 meeting of the Federal Open MarketCommittee said the credit tightening was approved on a 10-1 vote,with board member Martha Seeger voting no.   The minutes said Ms. Seeger objected to the tightening becauseshe did not see a significant risk of higher inflation. It said sheremained concerned that higher interest rates could have an adverseimpact on economic growth, jittery financial markets andfinancially troubled banks.   The minutes were the first official confirmation of the Fed'smove to tighten interest rates in early April. The move was notedat the time by economists, who said they also believe the Fedtightened once again earlier this month.   The closely watched federal funds rate, the interest that bankscharge each other to make overnight loans, has moved higher andaveraged 7.04 percent in the past week, the highest it has beensince last October.   A move by the Fed to lower the amount of money the bankingsystem has available shows up first in an increase in the federalfunds rate. With their own cost of money rising, banks are forcedto hike the interest rates they charge their customers.   After the second round of credit tightening by the Fed, majorbanks last week raised their prime lending rate from 8.5 percent to9 percent, the first hike in this benchmark lending rate sincebefore the October stock market collapse.   The committee met again Tuesday and many analysts believe itleft credit conditions unchanged, deciding to wait and see whetherinflationary pressures continue building.   Many economists believe the Fed will be forced to act again withanother round of credit tightening, possibly as early as nextmonth. Because of this belief, they are forecasting that variousinterest rates, including mortgage rates, will be headed higher inthe months ahead.   In the minutes of the March meeting, Fed policymakers noted thateconomic growth had been much stronger than was being predictedright after the Oct. 19 stock market plunge. They noted that U.S.factories were operating at the fastest pace in eight years whileunemployment was dropping to the lowest levels of this decade.   Several of the participants cited these developments as evidencethat the Fed needed to boost interest rates to ``prevent thebusiness expansion from gathering excessive and unsustainablemomentum that would lead to higher inflation. ... Moreover, actionat this time might preclude the need for more substantialtightening later.''   At another point, the minutes said, ``The economy might well benear the point where faster growth in business activity wouldinduce a higher rate of inflation, and in the view of severalmembers there was a potential for a sharp escalation in prices.''   The Federal Open Market Committee is made up of six members ofthe Federal Reserve Board and six of the 12 Fed regional bankpresidents, who serve on a rotating basis. There is currently onevacancy on the panel.   The minutes of Tuesday's meeting will not be released untilafter the next strategy session is held on July 6-7.</TEXT></DOC>
