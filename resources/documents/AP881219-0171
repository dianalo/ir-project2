Norman Rothberg, 52, was convicted of one count of conspiracy _taking a bribe to cover up ZZZZ Best's frauds _ and four counts ofmail fraud.   The 22-year-old Minkow, who was 16 when he created the ZZZZ Bestcarpet cleaning company in his parents' garage, was convicted by thesame jury last week of 57 counts of fraud.   Ten other defendants pleaded guilty to various charges.   Jurors deliberated heard four months of testimony about the $25million swindle that snared Wall Street brokerages, major banks andsmall investors. Before his downfall, Minkow gained wide publicityas an apparent boy genius in business.   Convicting young Minkow ``wasn't something that was easy,'' saidjury foreman Mel Tiedemann, 32, after the trial ended. ``I had toseparate my emotions from my decision.''   He noted that Minkow was ``just a kid'' and said, ``I wanted tolet him go. But I felt in my bones the guy was guilty.''   The Securities and Exchange Commission, a federal grand jury andthe Police Department remained involved Monday in investigationscentered on the Minkow case.   Last year, Police Chief Daryl Gates described ZZZZ Best as one ofseveral local companies linked to money laundering and drugtrafficking by East Coast crime families.   Police Department spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said the17-month-old statements are ``still valid and the investigation iscontinuing.''   Federal prosecutors say their work on the case now involves themore complex securities fraud side, exploring such issues as whetherinsider information was illegally used to profit from trading inZZZZ Best stock.   During the trial, Minkow claimed that he was exploited bymobsters who infiltrated his business.   Sentencing for Minkow was set for February, and sentencing forRothberg was set for March.   Prosecutors said Rothberg told a friend at the Ernst and Whinneyaccounting firm that something was amiss at ZZZZ Best. Later, heaccepted $25,000 from Minkow to retract that statement, prosecutorssaid.</TEXT></DOC>
