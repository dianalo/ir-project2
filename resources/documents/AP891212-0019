But a Costa Rican official said the two Central American leadersresolved the dispute and Azcona agreed to return to the gathering,which dealt with the region's fragile peace process.   Azcona's spokesman, Marco Tulio Romero, said the presidentwalked out because Nicaragua refused to promise to drop its caseagainst Honduras in the World Court in The Hague.   Nicaragua has a case pending against Honduras for harboringU.S.-backed Contra rebels. Romero said Honduras has taken stepstoward dismantling the Contras and feels Nicaragua should respondby dropping the suit.   After more than three hours, Ortega agreed to suspend the casefor six months and Azcona said he would return to the meeting,according to the Costa Rican information minister, Jorge Urbina.   ``There has never been a summit like this, such a climate ofconfrontation,'' Urbana said.   Earlier, sources close to the talks said the five presidentshoped to reach an agreement that would keep the peace processalive, even if the agreement did not resolve the conflicts.   Sources in the Nicaraguan, Salvadoran and Costa Ricandelegations, speaking on condition of anonymity, had said anagreement to keep the 28-month-old peace process going was likely.The agreement might include a call for more U.N. involvement, theysaid.   Another factor was the roles the Kremlin and Washington can playin achieving a peaceful solution, a subject mentioned at the Mass.   ``We know it does not depend on such distinguished citizens tobring us peace in Central America,'' the Rev. Leonel Chacon toldthe presidents attended by the presidents. ``There are others andwe ask them also in the name of God almighty to give us peace.''   Hundreds jammed the parish church in Coronado, a San Josesuburb. They clapped and cheered as presidents Ortega; Oscar Ariasof Costa Rica; Azcona; Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador and VinicioCerezo of Guatemala entered.   In a message to Arias on Monday, Pope John Paul II noted thesummit comes ``during a time of new tensions and painfulconflicts'' in Central America and said: ``I wish to express myfervent hope that this meeting, through a sincere and constructivedialogue, contributes to rediscovering the road of peace.''   The five presidents met in a long session Monday to work out afinal document based on at least three draft proposals, the sourcessaid.   The presidents discussed a proposal to ask the United States tohalt all aid to Contras fighting the leftist Sandinista governmentin Nicaragua, the sources said. Cuba and the Soviet Union would beasked to halt intervention in Central America.   Some sources said the Nicaraguans were willing to accept aloosely worded document implying they would not provide militaryaid to the Salvadoran rebels, but an end to U.S. non-lethal aid tothe Contras was considered unlikely.   The Salvadorans were discussing an agreement to work out aChristmas truce with the rebels in exchange for a statement by thepresidents criticizing the guerrillas for their bloody urbanoffensive in San Salvador last month.   The presidents agreed last August to disband the Contras by Dec.5 in exchange for democratization and a Feb. 25 election inNicaragua, but the Contras defied the agreement. They were onceagain unrepresented, as was El Salvador's rebel Farabundo MartiNational Liberation Front, known as FMLN.   Momentum toward peace has slowed since October, with fightingrenewed in both El Salvador and Nicaragua, a suspension ofdiplomatic relations between the two countries and increasingcampaign violence in Nicaragua.   Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria of El Salvador told TheAssociated Press his nation was willing to re-establish normalrelations, suspended after a Nicaraguan-registered plane loadedwith weapons for the FMLN crashed Nov. 26 in El Salvador.   Nicaragua is demanding that the Contras be demobilized byHonduras or through a reinforced U.N. force. Honduras says it wantsto disband the force camped in its territory, but won't use itsarmy or shed Honduran blood to do it.   A United Nations observer group was sent to verify the peacefulrepatriation of the Contras to Nicaragua and make sure no weaponswere sent from one country to another to help insurgent groups.   The Contras say no guarantees of democracy or freedom exist forthem inside Nicaragua and their presence is the only guarantee theFeb. 25 vote will be fair.   Costa Rica proposed a cease-fire in El Salvador, with U.N.verification, and Guatemala suggested the United States, Cuba andthe Soviet Union be asked to stop any kind of interference in theregion as a contribution to the peace process.   The regional summit opened Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
