However, rising prices are building political pressures totap stockpiles such as the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserveeven though these were established as buffers againstphysical shortages, not volatile markets.</LP><TEXT>   Total OPEC output has rebounded from the August low of19.7 million barrels a day to 22 million barrels a day ormore for September. That level generally hadn't been expecteduntil October.   The extra oil is coming mainly from Saudi Arabia, theUnited Arab Emirates and Venezuela. It's enough to replacethree-fourths of the four million barrels a day of embargoedIraqi and Kuwaiti oil.   Demand for OPEC's oil still is higher than its output,partly as a result of panic buying. But rising flow ratescombined with high world inventories make it unlikely thatthe International Energy Agency's emergency oil-sharingmechanism will be triggered when the governing board of 21oil-consuming nations meets again in Paris Friday.   The increased output doesn't bar individual nations fromdipping into their strategic oil reserves to alleviate highprices. Nor does it completely rule out a possible supplycrunch later this year. &quot;It's going to be a touch-and-gowinter,&quot; said Thomas A. Petrie of Petrie Parkman andamp; Co., aDenver investment firm specializing in energy. &quot;We couldstill see some pretty tight conditions in November andDecember in some fuels.&quot;   It's true that supplies of some petroleum products --including kerosene, jet fuel and naphtha, a petrochemicalfeedstock -- already are tight in some areas, particularly inregions of the Persian Gulf and Asia. &quot;This reflects the lossof Kuwait refining capacity and the added demands associatedwith the military buildup in the Gulf,&quot; Cambridge EnergyResearch Associates reported Friday.   But crude oil supplies are ample everywhere even thoughsome refiners worry that some oil replacing the lost Iraqipetroleum is of lower quality. In the U.S., according to thelatest count by the Department of Energy, crude oilinventories total 373.1 million barrels, 35 million above theyear-earlier level. And in Europe, according to EnergySecurity Analysis Inc., crude oil inventories are 25 millionbarrels higher than they were a year ago.   Energy Security Analysis is a Washington-based firm thatmonitors oil supplies world-wide. It estimates that at theend of August commercial onshore inventories of crude oil andchief petroleum products totaled 2.93 billion barrels. Thatwas 87 million barrels above the year-earlier level. Ifgovernment stockpiles are included, total global inventorieswere 113 million barrels higher than a year ago.   &quot;We've seen no statistical evidence that inventories arebeing drawn down significantly,&quot; said Sarah Emerson, a vicepresident of Energy Security Analysis. Still, she said, thesurplus is getting smaller just as demand increasesseasonally. &quot;No one is going to run out of crude,&quot; she said,&quot;but in a month or two we could start having problems onproducts.&quot;   Oil markets appear to be expecting severe disruptions ofsupplies. Petroleum prices underscore that sentiment. Theycontinued their run-up last week, reaching a nine-year highof more than $35 a barrel.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the futures price ofcrude oil for November delivery settled Friday at $35.43 abarrel -- up $2.01 a barrel for the day and $4.27 a barrelfor the week. Gasoline and heating oil futures also continuedto show sizzling gains, each advancing toward $1 a gallon.   U.S. and European energy officials foresee some problemsin the distribution of petroleum products, as is happeningalready in Asia. Still, many are concerned that the potentialfor a supply crunch exists, even if war doesn't break out inthe Middle East, because the global systems to produce,transport and refine oil have grown taut in the wake of thePersian Gulf standoff over Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.&quot;We areoperating in a fragile environment,&quot; one official explained.&quot;At every level, from the wellhead through the refinery, weare at capacity.&quot;   Still, energy representatives of oil-consuming nationshave been pleasantly surprised at the rapid increases inproduction by Saudi Arabia and others. According to mostestimates, the kingdom already is producing the additionaltwo million barrels a day it had pledged, putting its currentoutput at between 7.3 million and 7.5 million barrels. And itis understood to be pushing to expand its output to eight or8.5 million barrels a day.   Actual &quot;supplies&quot; from OPEC -- exports of oil plus thevolumes refined and used domestically -- exceed production atthe moment. That's because Saudi Arabia and others areselling oil from storage as well as from current production.Petro-Logistics Ltd. of Geneva monitors both the volumesrefined and exported by OPEC and estimates that such suppliescurrently total 22.2 million barrels a day.   But surveys of oil in tankers at sea by Petro-Logisticsindicate that so-called producer-owned stocks afloat arebeginning to shrink.   Further evidence of the declines in oil at sea comes fromtanker charterings, which dropped sharply in recent weeks.However, according to Robert Boslego, a Winchester, Mass.,oil consultant who monitors such charterings, there has been&quot;a significant rebound in tanker chartering fixtures sincethe depths reached in August.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
