It isn't that videophone technology, with which telephoneusers can see callers on a small screen, has finally becomeviable and affordable -- in telecommunications, that would beas unthinkable as Godot's actual arrival. But videophones ofall shapes and sizes are so plentiful here that, for thefirst time in years, even the skeptics feel it may be worthwaiting just a little longer.</LP><TEXT>   However, the wait continues to look as if it will be along one. All the videophones at the show use a still-raretransmission standard called ISDN, which allows voice, dataand pictures to be sent along the same telephone line. ISDNstands for Integrated Service Digital Network -- althoughTelecom wags have been saying it means &quot;It Still DoesNothing.&quot;   ISDN was the star of the previous Telecom, held here in1987, but the latest efforts to promote it smack slightly ofdesperation on the part of firms that have bet huge amountsthat it will succeed. Part of the problem: Even withsouped-up ISDN, the pictures on a videophone don't come closeto broadcast-quality television, so companies are forced totout a screen that shows blurry, jerky pictures.   In addition, many of the new videophone models are merelyprototypes that the companies have no plans to sell for atleast two years.   As with most electronic devices these days, theleading-edge videophone technology comes from Japan, where aselection of models is just hitting store shelves. But eventhe cheapest Japanese model on show here, a compact HitachiCorp. unit, sells for about $7,000, a price that still limitsits use to business applications. More typical is a bulkiermodel from Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co., which a companyspokeswoman says costs about $24,000 and is aimed at &quot;whoevercan afford it.&quot;   No major Japanese firm yet sells a videophone in Europe,and most companies say they plan to move first into the U.S.market. Still, at least three European manufacturers areshowing off new videophones they say can be orderedimmediately.   ---   As with any large gathering, Telecom '91 has been touchedby politics. The country of Lebanon, for example, has set upa stand just inside the main entrance here, asking forassistance in its effort to rebuild its ravagedtelecommunications networks. The numbers cited by Lebaneseofficials are startling: Half of the country'stelephone-switching capacity is out of action; 200 kilometresof cable have been damaged; one satellite ground-station hasbeen severely damaged, while two have been completelydestroyed.   The story is similar at the tiny Kuwaiti stand, whereofficials wear yellow ribbons pleading, &quot;Do not forget ourPOWs.&quot; Abdulmajeed Ali, a consultant to Kuwait's Ministry ofCommunications, says the Iraqi occupation and Persian GulfWar resulted in disastrous damage to Kuwait's links to theoutside world -- although the basic infrastructure is mostlyintact, he adds. At Telecom, Kuwait is looking for newtechnology to re-establish its position as a link in theglobal telecommunications network. &quot;There has been a lot ofsympathy for us here,&quot; he says. &quot;People are very happy to seethat Kuwait is still there.&quot;   Meanwhile at the pavilion of Yugoslavia's Iskra Telekom,continuing dispatches from that country's civil war don'tseem to faze a steady stream of customers, who press througha small hospitality area. &quot;We have had much, much morebusiness here than we expected,&quot; says Zvezdana Kompara, anIskra spokeswoman. Based in Slovenia, Iskra specializes incheap but up-to-date telecommunications equipment fordeveloping countries and rural areas.   Although hostilities erupted in Slovenia in June, Ms.Kompara says they didn't touch Iskra's factories and have nowlargely died down.   ---   Translators are busy every day in the conference rooms ofthe convention center here, as high-ranking executives gatherto discuss topics such as regulation, economic developmentand technology directions. On the exhibition floor, however,Japan's NEC Corp. is showing off what it claims is the firstsystem to computerize translation between Japanese andEnglish in &quot;real time&quot; -- and then output the results inFrench and Spanish too. The company says the set-up is a steptoward its ultimate dream of telephone systems that translateforeign speech automatically.   In practice, the NEC system is a bit clunky. Although itwill recognize speech from almost any Japanese or Englishspeaker -- an impressive achievement in itself -- volunteersare asked to choose from a tight menu of phrase-booksentences that supposedly reflect a typical conversation at atourist-information booth. After a delay of four seconds orso, the translated sentence is played back in acomputer-generated voice or, in the case of French andSpanish, simply printed on a computer screen.   An NEC spokesman says the system can understand about 500words. The tourist-booth scenario, he says, is deliberatelyrestrictive, partly because NEC thinks the initial market fortranslating machines will be in limiting contexts: airports,for example, or hospitals. In the future, he adds, touristsmight carry small translating machines tailored to help themin restaurants or public transportation.   ---   As usual, the number-one topic at Telecom cocktail partiesis the enormous scale of the event itself. The pavilions atthe exposition, which occurs every four years, have grownprogressively more elaborate since the event was founded in1971.   The growth has culminated this year in the sprawlingGerman pavilion, a dramatic structure that spans four storiesover two separate convention halls, dominating every otherstand here.   Punctuated by sweeping, white-lit staircases that curvedown from each corner, the stand contains exhibits from mostGerman companies at the show, which pooled their alottedspace and resources to create a super-pavilion thatreportedly cost more than $30 million to build.   Other pavilions, while not as overwhelming, are similarlyimpressive. France's Alcatel N.V. has a huge presence at theshow, centering on a pavilion that also reaches four storieshigh and looks rather like a small office building, completewith its own glass elevator.   A big winner from all this one-upmanship is the city ofGeneva, which reaped much of the estimated $200 million thatwent into fitting out the convention center -- not to mentionthe money spent by the estimated 60,000 visitors to the show,and the employees of about 850 exhibitors.</TEXT></DOC>
