It also signaled EC fears about U.S.congressional calls for limits on foreign investment andcriticized laws that cover activities outside the country.   While U.S. protectionism hasn't increased in the pastyear, EC officials said many points in the report stemmedfrom the failure to conclude the Uruguay Round of talkswithin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The reportdoesn't specify any threat of action, but if the currentUruguay trade negotiations collapse, the EC could filecomplaints under GATT about specific trade practices.   Among the barriers cited are measures encouraging orrequiring state agencies to &quot;buy American.&quot; For example,Kentucky forbids imported goods and several states banforeign steel in new highways. More than half the statesrestrict foreigners' land ownership, and some curb foreignbanking and insurance firms.   The National Association of State Development Agenciessaid the states like job-creating foreign trade andinvestment, and at least 35 place a &quot;high priority&quot; onattracting such investments and brokering U.S.-foreignventures.                                                                                                          NEW CHERNOBYL DATA RELEASED                                                                                                          Five years after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, theSoviet Union has identified 500,000 people contaminated byradiation and is giving medical care to 300,000 a year.Moscow left unchanged at 31 or 32 the deaths resultingdirectly from the Ukrainian power plant explosion on April26, 1986. Many Soviet and Western researchers dispute theofficial death toll, which has stood for three years, andassert that at least 500 and as many as 10,000 people havedied of cancer and other illnesses caused by the accident.                                                                                                          NORWAY CANCELS WHALING SEASON                                                                                                          For the first time since the 16th century, Oslo called offits whale hunt this year. The International WhalingCommission for five years has banned Norway and other nationsfrom commercial whale hunting, but allowed them to kill a fewwhales each year for scientific purposes, such as gatheringbirth-rate and mortality data. Norway said research huntingwould resume next year. Environmentalists say the researchkills by Norway, Iceland and Japan are disguised commercialhunts, as much of the meat is sold.                                                                                                          GIRAFFE BARBECUE PLAN PROTESTED                                                                                                          A South African social group's plan for what could be theworld's first giraffe barbecue has drawn flak. Die AfrikanerKlub has already sold 300 tickets at $40 each for the May 4roast of a 2,800-pound giraffe. Barbecues, or braais, are apopular entertainment in South Africa. Animal advocatesdenounced killing a wild animal as &quot;a gimmick.&quot; The barbecueisn't illegal, as giraffes aren't endangered.                                                                                                          GLOBAL EFFORTS ARE REWARDED                                                                                                          German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher receivedthe Athinai Prize for Man and Mankind for advancing East-Westrelations. Also in Athens, former U.S. President Jimmy Carterwas awarded the Aristotelis Prize for Man and Society. TheGreenpeace International environmental group also won aprize. The awards and $100,000 each are given annually by theAlexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation to honorcontributions in scholarship, human rights and theenvironment.   SOVIETS DETAIL '90 EMIGRATION                                                                                                          About 452,000 people emigrated from the U.S.S.R. in 1990.Almost 60% of the emigres went to Israel, where Jewsautomatically gain citizenship; about one-third went toGermany, and 2.9% moved to the U.S. Emigration has increasedin the past several years as Moscow gradually easedrestrictions.                                                                                                          BRAZIL'S INFLATION FIGHT IMPERILED                                                                                                          Brazil's tough anti-inflation program is threatened by arash of court cases that seek restitution of funds thegovernment froze in attacking runaway prices.   The stampede of cases -- an estimated 6,000 in two daysthis week -- was triggered by a Sao Paulo court ruling thatBrasilia's temporary seizure of financial assets last yearwas unconstitutional. The ruling poses a fresh challenge tothe government's economic policy just as inflation for Marchcame in at the first one-digit monthly rate since June.   About two-thirds of the money circulating in Brazil'seconomy was frozen. Some companies and individuals have usedlegal loopholes to free some of the cash, but about 6.7trillion cruzados novos ($26.39 billion) remain frozen. Thegovernment had pledged to return the money, with interest, in12 monthly installments starting in September.   Brasilia is struggling to keep prices under control whilelifting a price freeze that disrupted production andtriggered strikes in the industrial Sao Paulo area.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          Singapore officials raided music stores and seized compactdisks and cassettes with banned songs by artists includingthe Beatles, Elton John, 2 Live Crew and George Michael.Songs can be banned in Singapore if they contain themesconsidered objectionable or purvey values deemed undesirable.. . . Bonn warned that the danger &quot;continues unabated&quot; formore attacks by the German Red Army Faction terrorist gang,which claimed responsibility for killing the first leader ofthe Treuhandanstalt privatization agency.</TEXT></DOC>
