The Vagos, which was formed in the 1960s to rival the HellsAngels, alleges Hawthorne Police Department used unnecessary force,brandished guns in children's faces and confiscated personalproperty during raids on 43 homes on Aug. 9 and Sept. 7, 1983.   The lawsuit, filed jointly by the American Civil LibertiesUnion, alleges emotional distress and civil rights violations. Thejury trial before Superior Court Judge Maurice Hogan Jr. openedlast month, and will hear from nearly 200 witnesses during the nexttwo months, court officials said.   Ed ``Fat Eddie'' Serna, who has since retired from the Vagos,testified that his restored 1948 Harley Davidson was confiscatedand returned months later with a rusted motor and broken shift rod,the chrome pitted and the paint scratched.   ``It was in real bad shape,'' he testified. ``I felt very angry.I worked four years on it and was that close to driving it and itwas taken away.''   About 50 police officers from various departments acrosssouthern California took part in the hunt for Vagos member Raymond``South Bay Ray'' Malloy. Some of the homes were occupied by formerand current Vagos members, and others by people who said they hadnever heard of the group.   Molloy was not found, and later surrendered. He pleaded guiltyto a reduced assault and battery charge and was sentenced to 142days in jail. Molloy stabbed three men in a bar brawl, but none wasseriously injured.   The defendants were named as former Hawthorne Police ChiefKenneth R. Stonebraker, three lieutenants, a sergeant and numerousunidentified officers. The ACLU alleges Hawthorne police lied inaffidavits to obtain search warrants and harassed the families tomake Malloy surrender.   Hawthorne police denied the allegations and say they believedthe Vagos group was hiding Malloy.   ``Vagos were known violent people, and the police were knockingon doors with the expectation of finding Malloy, who had beenaccused of three vicious stabbings,'' said John Daly, an attorneyfor the city.</TEXT></DOC>
