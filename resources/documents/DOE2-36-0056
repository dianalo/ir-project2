The model forecasts annualoil and natural gas production on a regional basis. Natural gas is modeledby gas category, generally conforming to categories defined by the NaturalGas Policy Act (NGPA) of 1978, as well as a category representing gaspriced by way of a spot market (referred to as ``spot'' gas). A linearprogram is used to select developmental drilling activities for conventionaloil and gas and exploratory drilling activities for deep gas on the basisof their economic merit, subject to constraints on available rotary rigsand constraints based on historical drilling patterns. Using exogenouslyspecified price paths for oil and gas, net present values are computedfor fixed amounts of drilling activity for oil and gas development anddeep gas exploration in each of six onshore regions. Through maximizingtotal net present value, the linear program provides forecasts of drillingactivities, reserve additions, and production. Oil and shallow gas exploratorydrilling activities are forecast on the basis of econometrically derivedequations, which are dependent on specified price paths for the two fuels.10 refs., 3 figs., 10 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
