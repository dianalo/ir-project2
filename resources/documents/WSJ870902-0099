The other good news is that, despite all the disorder, the Philippine economy is recovering from the Marcos slump, growing at nearly a 6% rate. But President Aquino has big troubles and we wonder why she isn't getting more support from the American politicians who helped her win power.    The immediate task is to find the coup makers and mete out justice, resisting any temptations to go as easy as she did after past attempts. She also needs to consider the difficulty of maintaining discipline in the military if her line toward the communists the troops are fighting is too soft.    In the longer term, the crucial task is to rebuild a country beggared and divided by decades of economic misrule. This means moving ahead with the economic liberalization that has aided the present recovery. It makes little sense to impose new burdens such as the increased fuel levies that caused massive strikes just prior to the coup attempt -- and may have encouraged the coup plotters to act.    The U.S. Congress could support reconstruction by encouraging more responsible behavior in the newly elected Philippine Congress. Taking their lead from Peru -- of all places -- Philippine lawmakers have introduced bills that would slap a ceiling on repayments of the country's $28.6 billion foreign debt. The idea is to limit annual repayments to 10% of export earnings. Any country that stiffs its creditors damages its own development. Philippine Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin last month warned Mrs. Aquino that a freeze on debt repayments could cripple recovery.    Other bills would outlaw the presence of both nuclear arms and nuclear-powered vessels in Philippine territory. Any official who sanctioned a port call by a U.S. nuclear submarine, for example, would be subject to criminal penalties and possible impeachment. This does not augur well for the U.S. bases at Clark Air Field and Subic Bay, whose leases come up for review early next year.    New Zealand's David Lange seems to have inspired this brainstorm, but the Philippines do not have New Zealand's distant isolation. The U.S. bases provide the chief balance to Soviet bases in Vietnam, just a refugee-ride across the South China Sea.    Philippine Senate President Jovito Salonga, who toured Clark Air Base last week, worries that the U.S. facility is &quot;a limitation on sovereignty&quot; for the Philippines. What ought to worry Sen. Salonga more is that if the Yankees go home, the Philippine army will be his only defense against Soviet sovereignty. The current battle against 24,000 armed Communist guerrillas seems more than enough to occupy the army right now.    It would serve the interests of both the U.S. and the Philippines if the two could agree to renewal of the base leases in return for a U.S. offer of free and open access to U.S. markets for Philippine exporters. Right now, thanks to Washington's protectionists, Philippine exports such as sugar, shoes and textiles are partly shut out by U.S. import quotas. Were such goods freely allowed into the U.S., the Philippine economy would grow more rapidly, U.S. consumers would live better for a lower price and Philippine legislators could stop huffing and puffing over the bases long enough to brag about negotiating a terrific deal.    With that kind of encouragement, Mrs. Aquino might be able to get on with some other pressing business, such as the privatization of state-held companies. Mrs. Aquino has signed a land-reform decree, which carries serious economic risks, but she could urge the Philippine Congress to decide quickly on a minimal program.    Clearly, there is a supportive role to be played in all this by American politicians. We hope that history won't write that Americans savored the excitement of helping Mrs. Aquino to power and then abandoned her to her enemies. </TEXT></DOC>
