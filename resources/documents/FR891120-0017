The toxicology data listed below were considered in supportof this reexpression.1. Several acute toxicology studies placing technical-grade glyphosatein Toxicity Category III and IV.2. A 1-year feeding study with dogs fed dosage levels of 0, 20, 100, and500 milligrams/kilogram/day (mg/kg/day) with a no-observable-effect level(NOEL) of 500 mg/kg/day.3. A 2-year oncogenicity study in mice fed dosage levels of 0, 150, 750,and 4,500 mg/kg/day with an equivocal (uncertain) oncogenic effect (a slightincrease in the incidence of renal tubular adenomas, a benign tumor ofthe kidney, in males) at the highest dose tested (HDT) of 4,500 mg/kg/day.4. A chronic feeding/oncogenicity study in rats fed dosage levels of 0,3, 10, and 31 mg/kg/day with no oncogenic effects observed under the conditionsof the study at dose levels up to and including 31 mg/kg/day (HDT) anda systemic NOEL of 31 mg/kg/day.5. A developmental toxicity study in rats given doses of 0, 300, 1,000,and 3,500 mg/kg/day with no teratogenic effects occurring up to and including3,500 mg/kg/day (HDT); a maternal NOEL of 1,000 mg/kg/day based on weightgain deficits, altered physical appearance, and mortality during treatmentat 3,500 mg/kg/day (HDT); and a fetotoxic NOEL of 1,000 mg/kg/day basedon unossified sternebrae in fetuses from high-dose (3,500 mg/kg/day) dams.6. A developmental toxicity study in rabbits given doses of 0, 75, 175,and 350 mg/kg/day with no teratogenic effects occurring up to and including350 mg/kg/day (HDT); a maternal NOEL of 175 mg/kg/day based on alteredappearance and mortality at the highest dose (350 mg/kg/day); and a fetotoxicNOEL of 350 mg/kg/day (HDT).7. A three-generation reproduction study in rats fed dosage levels of 0,3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day with a NOEL of 10 mg/kg/day based on focal, unilateral,renal tubular dialation in the kidneys of male pups from high-dose dams(30 mg/kg/day). No effects on fertility or reproductive parameters werenoted up to and including 30 mg/kg/day (HDT).8. Mutagenicity data included chromosomal aberration <T3>in vitro</T3> (no aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells were causedwith and without S-9 activation); DNA repair in rat hepatocytes; <T3>in vivo</T3> bone marrow cytogenic test in rats; rec-assay with <T3>B. subtilis;</T3> reverse mutation test with <T3>S. typhimurium;</T3> Ames test with <T3>S. typhimurium;</T3> and a dominant-lethal mutagenicity test in mice(all negative).The acceptable daily intake (ADI) based on the three-generation rat reproductionstudy (NOEL of 10 mg/kg/day) and using a hundredfold safety factor is calculatedto be 0.1 mg/kg/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC)for published and unpublished but approved tolerances is 0.005094 mg/kg/day,which utilizes 5.0 percent of the ADI. The addition of the monoammoniumsalt of glyphosate does not increase the TMRC and will not increase thepercentage of the ADI utilized.Desirable data lacking are a repeat of the rat oncogenicity study. Becauseof the large difference between the high dose tested in the rat and mouseoncogenicity studies, the rat oncogenicity study was rereviewed. The rereviewindicated that a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) may not have been reachedin that study. Therefore, the Agency decided to request a repeat of therat oncogenicity study at doses high enough to reach an MTD.There are currently no actions pending against the continued registrationof this pesticide. No detectable residues of <T3>N</T3>-nitrosoglyphosate, a contaminant of glyphosate, are expectedto be present in the commodities for which tolerances are established.The oncogenic potential of glyphosate is not fully understood. Becauseof the equivocal (uncertain) nature of the oncogenic response in mice,the Agency referred the issue to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, andRodenticide Act (FIFRA) Science Advisory Panel (SAP) for a ``Weight ofthe Evidence'' classification. After rereviewing all available evidence,the SAP proposed that glyphosate be classified as a ``Class D Oncogen''having ``inadequate animal evidence of oncogenicity,'' and recommendeda Data Call-In for further studies in rats and/or mice to clarify unresolvedquestions. After a review of all available information, the Agency decidedto classify glyphosate as a ``Class D Oncogen'' and also to request a repeatof the mouse oncogenicity study. A subsequent review by the Agency of thedata and additional information submitted concluded that the mouse oncogenicitystudy would not be required at this time. Once the rat oncogenicity studyis received and reviewed, the need for a repeat mouse oncogenicity studywill be reevaluated.The Agency's policy has been to issue new use registrations in which theresulting change in TMRC is less than 1 percent; however, any significantnew use registrations will be handled on a case-by-case basis and may notbe issued until issues in the Glyphosate Registration Standard have beenresolved. Monsanto Co. has been notified of these conclusions and deficienciesby the Glyphosate Registration Standard dated June 30, 1986, and by a letterdated July 9, 1989.The nature of the residue in plants is adequately understood, and an adequateanalytical method (gas-liquid chromatography with a flame photometric detector),is available for enforcement purposes in Volume II of the Food and DrugAdministration Pesticide Analytical Manual. The established toleranceson liver and kidney of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, poultry, and sheepare considered adequate to cover residues of glyphosate and AMPA resultingfrom the proposed use of the monoammonium salt of glyphosate on registeredcrops.Based on the information considered by the Agency, it is concluded thatthe tolerance established by amending 40 CFR Part 180 will protect thepublic health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below.Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days afterpublication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk,at the address given above. Such objections should specify the provisionsof the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections.If a hearing is requested, the objections must state the issues for thehearing and the grounds for the objections. A hearing will be granted ifthe objections are supported by grounds legally sufficient to justify therelief sought.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certificationstatement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 4, 1981 (40 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 20, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
