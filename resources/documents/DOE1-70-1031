A new extract spectrophotometricmethod to determine UO/sub 2/ (II) between 3 and 20 ppm ({lambda} = 320nm, e* = 14250 L.mol/sup -1/ . cm/sup -1/) is proposed. This method isbased on the extraction of the ionic association complex formed betweenMHA, UO/sub 2/(II) and Adogen 464 in toluene, of stoichiometry {vert_bar}2MHA: 1 UO/sub 2/(II){vert_bar} : {vert_bar}2 Adogen 464{vert_bar}. Theeffect of various parameters has been studied.</TEXT></DOC>
