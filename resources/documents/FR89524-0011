The pesticide is considered useful for the purpose forwhich the tolerance is sought.The data considered in support of the tolerance include:1. Plant and animal metabolism studies.2. A rat oral median lethal dose (LD<T2>50</T2>) study with an LD<T2>50</T2> of 2.357 grams per kilogram (g/kg) or 2,357 milligrams perkilogram (mg/kg).3. A 90-day rat feeding study with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of20 ppm (1.0 mg/kg/day).4. A 90-day dog feeding study with a NOEL of 16 ppm (0.4 mg/kg/day).5. A 2-year dog feeding study with a NOEL of 15 ppm (0.37 mg/kg/day) anda lowest-effect level (LEL) of 75 ppm (1.875 mg/kg/day).6. A rat teratology study with a NOEL of 32 mg/kg/day for developmentaleffects and maternal toxicity and an LEL of 100 mg/kg/day (highest dosetested) for developmental effects and maternal toxicity.7. A rabbit teratology study with a maternal toxicity NOEL of 12.5 mg/kg/dayand a maternal LEL (decreased weight gain and reduced food consumption)of 50 mg/kg/day, and a developmental toxicity NOEL of 50 mg/kg/day, anda developmental toxicity LEL of 200 mg/kg/day (highest dose tested) withan increased incidence of rib anomalies and diaphragmatic hernias at thisdose level. Two rabbit teratology studies have been submitted for thispesticide. Both of the studies (including the one cited above, with dosesof 0, 12.5, 50, and 200 mg/kg) have been classified as supplementary.8. A two-generation rat reproduction study with a NOEL of 5 ppm (0.25 mg/kg/day).9. A 2-year dog chronic feeding study with a NOEL of 15 ppm (0.37 mg/kg/day).10. A rat oncogenicity (28 months)/chronic feeding (24 months) study withno observed oncogenic potential at any dose up to 180 ppm (9.0 mg/kg/day),the highest dose tested and a NOEL for chronic toxicity at 30 ppm (1.5mg/kg/day).11. A 2-year mouse oncogenicity study with no observed oncogenic potentialat any dose up to 40 ppm (6 mg/kg/day), the highest dose tested.12. A negative <T3>in vitro</T3> human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration mutagenicitystudy; a negative unscheduled DNA synthesis study with HeLa cells; a negative(both with and without S9 activation) Ames assay with the appropriate strainsof <T3>Salmonella typhimurium</T3>; a negative (with and without S9 activation)DNA repair study in <T3>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</T3>; and a negative mouse micronucleus assay. Based on a NOEL of 0.25 mg/kg/day in the two-generation rat reproductionstudy and a hundredfold safety factor, the acceptable daily intake (ADI)has been set at 0.0025 mg/kg/day with a maximum permissible intake (MPI)of 0.15 mg/day for a 60-kg person. The established and proposed toleranceshave a theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) of 0.000030 mg/kg/dayand would utilize 1.2 percent of the ADI.  There are no regulatory actions pending against the registration of thispesticide. The nature of the residue of the pesticide is adequately understoodfor use on cotton and peanuts, and an adequate analytical method, gas chromatographywith electron capture detector, is available for enforcement purposes.There is no expectation of secondary residues in meat, milk, poultry oreggs.  Because of the long lead-time from establishing these tolerances to publicationof the enforcement methodology in the <T3>Pesticide Analytical Manual</T3>, Vol. II, the analytical methodologyis being made available to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement whenrequested from:<ITAG tagnum="15">William Grosse, Chief, Information Services Branch (H7502C), ProgramManagement and Support Division, Office of Pesticide Programs, EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Office location and telephone number: Rm. 223, CM andplusmin;2, 1921Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703) 557-2613.</ITAG>Based on the information and data considered, the Agency concludes thatthe tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerancesare established as set forth below.  Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days afterpublication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk,at the address given above. Such objections should specify the provisionsof the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections.If a hearing is requested, the objections must state the issues for thehearing and the grounds for the objections. A hearing will be granted ifthe objections are supported by grounds legally sufficient to justify therelief sought.  The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.  Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certificationstatement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180  </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 11, 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
