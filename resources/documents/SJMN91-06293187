Thatcase is hailed by property-rights advocates as the first major constitutionalblow to restrictive environmental regulations.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Home  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DEBATE BUILDS AGAIN OVER RENT CONTROL  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Real Estate; Bradley Inman is an Oakland-based real estate writer.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Legal tide turning; While tenant activists expect the courts to uphold rentcontrol as they have in the past, the apartment industry is betting that thechanging composition of the court will work in its favor. In the last twodecades, several conservative justices have been appointed to both the U.S.and California supreme courts.;   The CAA-PLF legal plan is unusual becausethe two organizations haven't even identified a case they intend to push.Instead, they are building a legal war chest that can pay for four years ofconstitutional feuding. Their case will hinge on the Fifth Amendment -- theConstitution's property rights clause, which prohibits taking of propertywithout just compensation.;   Gathering forces; In a fund-raising pitch tomembers, CAA executive Michael Sandel wrote, &quot;The CAA-PLF rent control projectpromises to finally bring an end to rent control.&quot;;   In the last two decades,disgruntled property owners have failed to convince the Legislature, localofficials or the voters to turn back existing rent control rules.;   FifteenCalifornia cities have rent controls on apartments. At least 50 percent of thestate's apartments are regulated, and both big and small cities have some sortof controls. Those communities include Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose,Oakland, Berkeley, Palm Springs and Cotati.;   In California, the push forrent control began in the late 1970s, after a period of soaring rents. Thepolitical support for controls was further fueled by the passage ofProposition 13. During the campaign for the 1978 property tax-cutting measure,landlords promised to lower rents if the ballot measure was approved. Instead,rents increased in response to market demand.;   All the cities that havecontrols on apartments enacted the regulations within five years afterProposition 13. Since then, the housing industry has beaten back controls inother cities, but they haven't been able to overturn regulations incommunities that have already adopted them.;   Based on historic rulings, thecourts would seem to be an unlikely ally for opponents to rent control. Overthe last three decades, both the U.S. and California supreme courts haveupheld rent control.;   However, the court has sent a favorable signal toproperty rights advocates with cases such as the Nolan decision, which struckdown part of the California Coastal Commission Act. That sort of precedent,say landlords, is a sign that their $1 million investment will pay off.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Bradley Inman column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911019  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  485  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, October 19, 199100293187,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
