(IBI) plans to release next month a version of itswidely used application-development environment that will be among the firstavailable front ends for SQL Server and potentially the earliest to provideaccess to data outside a  LAN.andM;The Focus SQL Server Interface, a $395 server program that IBI plans to shipin mid-June, enables Focus applications running on a PC to transparentlyaccess data residing in SQL Server, said Keith Toleman, marketing manager forIBI's Micro Products Division in New York.andP;  SQL Server, released last month,is a database engine for OS/2 networks marketed jointly by Ashton-Tate,Microsoft Corp. and Sybase Inc.andM;With the new IBI interface, users can develop applications for SQL Server inthe familiar Focus language or, with only minor adjustments, they can runexisting PC Focus applications with the database engine, Toleman said.andO;Currently, users developing SQL Server applications generally must useregular programming languages such as C.andM;In addition, the Focus front end can access data stored in minicomputer andmainframe Focus databases, and then integrate that data with informationstored in SQL Server, he said.andM;This connectivity to other databases, as well as the ability to leverageusers' knowledge in developing applications in Focus, makes the new IBI frontend appealing to many users considering SQL Server, observers said.andM;''Having our current end-user environment available for SQL Server as soon asit ships is appealing,'' said Mike Purcell, staff software engineer at BaxterHealthcare Corp. in Deerfield, Ill.andP;  It is also important to get corporatedata stored on mainframes into SQL Server, which makes Focus' connectivityaspect interesting to Baxter as well, he said.andM;Besides offering Focus as an SQL Server front end, IBI is authorized to sellthe database engine as part of a reseller agreement with Ashton-Tate, Tolemansaid.andM;IBI can offer SQL Server to its installed base of 500,000 Focus users as analternative to IBI's own OS/2 network database engine, which will beavailable in the third quarter, he said.andM;''It has always been our strategy to have the Focus tools operateindependently of the underlying DBMS [database-management system],'' Tolemansaid.andP;  ''We're selling SQL Server as a one-stop shopping service to ourcustomers, should they decide to go with another DBMS engine besides Focus.''andM;Toleman stressed that although IBI will sell SQL Server, the company is notlimiting its front-end support to that database engine.andP;  IBI will have Focusfront ends for IBM's Extended Edition and any other database server the firmconsiders strategic, he said.andM;Despite the prominence of Focus in the mainframe and minicomputer world, someindustry observers believe that many PC users will hold out for such SQLServer front ends as Ashton-Tate's dBASE IV 1.1, Borland International Inc.'sParadox or DataEase International Corp.'s DataEase.andM;Ashton-Tate is promising a third-quarter delivery of dBASE IV 1.1; DataEaseand Borland are targeting late summer for the release of their SQL Serverfront  ends.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
