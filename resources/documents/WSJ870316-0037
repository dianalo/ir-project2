Ms. Walters, a veteran correspondent for ABC television, interviewed Mr. Ghorbanifar and Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi last December, less than three weeks after the Iran-Contra scandal erupted. After the interview, Ms. Walters prepared an internal memo outlining, among other things, Mr. Ghorbanifar's private statements, and sent it to the White House, according to Richard Wald, an ABC News senior vice president.    Mr. Wald said the memo, sent to the White House at Mr. Ghorbanifar's request and without prior approval from the network, was &quot;a rather unusual thing.&quot; Mr. Wald said Ms. Walters informed management after she sent the memo to the White House. When asked if her conduct was appropriate, he said: &quot;I would rather not comment.&quot;    The same memo, he said, was circulated among editors at ABC News and was &quot;the basis of our reporting&quot; on the Iran-Contra affair. Mr. Ghorbanifar was the principal Iranian middleman handling U.S. arms sales to Iran.    Ms. Walters, in an interview last Friday, declined to give details about the information provided by Mr. Ghorbanifar, except to acknowledge that some of it dealt with alleged payments to Iranian officials. She said she hadn't broadcast the allegations, but said that she had included them in the information she passed along to President Reagan.    Ms. Walters said she &quot;felt terrible&quot; acting as an intermediary for Mr. Ghorbanifar, but she said she agreed to pass along information because she believed it was important for President Reagan to receive it. &quot;So, I made sure it was delivered,&quot; Ms. Walters said. &quot;It is very unimportant whether I delivered it or somebody else did.&quot;    According to one account, Ms. Walters was said to have passed the information along to Nancy Reagan. However, Ms. Walters said, &quot;That is not exactly how it happened,&quot; but declined to elaborate. Three days after the first lady's press secretary, Elaine Crispen, was asked whether Mrs. Reagan had received some information from Mr. Ghorbanifar through Ms. Walters, the press secretary responded yesterday: &quot;I haven't had time to check into it.&quot;    This odd episode in the Iran-Contra scandal raises questions about who at the White House received the information and what was done with it. No mention of the Walters memo is contained in the report issued by the Tower Commission, the three-member panel appointed by President Reagan to probe the Iran-Contra affair.    As part of his overall request for documents, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh has asked the White House for access to memos, letters or other communications from the middlemen and other participants in the arms sales, according to federal law-enforcement officials.    A major area of interest to Mr. Walsh, these officials said, is whether funds generated as a result of the arms sales were funneled to Iranian officials. Mr. Walsh's team, as reported, is investigating whether funds were paid to the speaker of Iran's parliament, Hashemi Rafsanjani. Officials also said the Walsh team has expanded its probe to cover other Iranian officials, including Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, the designated successor to Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.    Such payments would prove embarrassing to the Reagan administration and could violate federal conspiracy and fraud laws if, among other things, proceeds from the arms sales were deemed to belong to the U.S. government.    Ms. Walters Friday acknowledged that some of the information from Mr. Ghorbanifar concerned alleged payments to an Iranian faction headed by the Ayatollah Montazeri. Mr. Wald also confirmed that Ms. Walters's memo included information about payments to the faction. But he said, &quot;It was sort of inconclusive.&quot;    Ms. Walters said that &quot;almost everything&quot; she received from Messrs. Ghorbanifar and Khashoggi eventually was broadcast by the network. But, she said, she didn't feel she could disclose some of the information because she was concerned it would &quot;jeopardize others' safety.&quot; She wouldn't elaborate, but her comments seemed to refer to American hostages in Lebanon, some of whom are captives of groups allied with Iran.    Mr. Wald said that he recalled that Ms. Walters's memo included discussion of efforts to free some hostages around Christmas time last year.    The exclusive interview with Mr. Ghorbanifar and Mr. Khashoggi, the Saudi businessman who provided financing for the arms sales, was broadcast Dec. 11 on ABC's &quot;20-20,&quot; a program Ms. Walters co-hosts. Mr. Ghorbanifar asserted in the interview that despite public disclosure of the secret arms sales to Iran, &quot;I see great hopes of seeing your hostages released&quot; and developing better U.S.-Iran relations.    Without providing details, Ms. Walters said she now is preparing to broadcast information that hadn't been disclosed. &quot;It is time for me now to tell my story . . . where it came from, how it came.&quot;    Federal criminal investigators believe that Mr. Ghorbanifar could explain what happened to the millions of dollars that Iran funneled through various intermediaries and bank accounts to pay for weapons purchased from the U.S. and Israel.    According to a letter signed by Mr. Ghorbanifar after the arms sales became public, profits from the sales &quot;would be made available&quot; to Ayatollah Montazeri and his faction &quot;to strengthen them in their fight to take power.&quot;    Moreover, the letter, which was disclosed in February by the Washington Post, indicates that &quot;substantial payments financed by loans were made&quot; to the Montazeri faction, &quot;with the hope the funds would be recovered at a later stage from arms sales.&quot; It isn't clear to whom Mr. Ghorbanifar sent the letter. Ms. Walters said she never passed along any Ghorbanifar letter to the White House.    Mr. Ghorbanifar's lawyer, Stuart Pierson, declined to comment or to make his client available for an interview. Mr. Khashoggi couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
