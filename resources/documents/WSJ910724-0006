Non-farm personal income fell 0.6% in the six New Englandstates in the first quarter, the only region to record adecline. That income rose a minuscule 0.1% in the fourthquarter, less than in any other region. Personal income fellmore in New Hampshire than in any other state, declining 1.9%in the first quarter.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The first-quarter slowdown was particularly pronounced inthe Far West and Great Lakes regions,&quot; the department said.Only in the Southeastern states did personal income risefaster in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter oflast year, climbing 0.7% in the first period after risingonly 0.3% in the fourth quarter.   Personal income includes wages, rent, dividends andinterest before most taxes. The figures aren't adjusted forinflation or for population shifts, but usual seasonalfluctuations are removed. Because farm income is so erraticfrom one quarter to the next, the Commerce Department saysnon-farm income is a more useful measure.   For the U.S. as a whole, non-farm personal income rose0.3% in the first quarter, the smallest quarterly increase inthe past two decades. Slowdowns occurred in 32 states. In thefourth quarter, income rose by 0.9%.   Non-farm income was up 1% in the Rocky Mountain states inthe first quarter, the largest increase of all the regions,after climbing 1.8% in the fourth quarter. Leading all thestates was Idaho with a 2% increase.   Here are the increases for the other regions: Southwest,up 0.8%; Plains, up 0.4%; Mideast (or mid-Atlantic), up 0.2%;and Great Lakes, up 0.1%.</TEXT></DOC>
