(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Flatbed, overhead, and sheetfed scanners are the workhorses of theimage-capture world.andM;Thanks to falling prices and increasing flexibility, scanners are popping upon desktops everywhere.andP;  Monochrome, gray-scale, or color images; text, lineart, or photographs; loose, bound, or odd-sized paper; even smallthree-dimensional objects - you name it, there's a desktop scanner that canhandle it.andM;To help you sort through the bewildering array of choices, MacUser Labssubjected 15 flatbed scanners -- 11 gray-scale and 4 color - and 3 overheadscanners to a grueling set of benchmark tests.andP;  We judged each on its speed,resolvability, halftone quality, gray scale, color range, text-extractioncapabilities, and ease of use.andP;  In addition to examining the flatbed andoverhead models, we also looked at 4 sheetfed scanners and the uniqueThunderware ThunderScan to see how well these specialists perform.andP;  Ingeneral we found that grayscale technology has really come into its own overthe last few years while color capabilities are still maturing.andM;Of the three types of desktop scanners - flatbed, overhead, and sheetfed -flatbed scanners command the largest market share.andP;  They've earned theirposition because of their versatility, image quality, and ease of use.andP;  Ifyou're interested in introducing your Mac to the world of images, you shouldfirst consider a flatbed scanner.andP;  Although overhead and sheetfed scannerseach have their own special abilities, odds are that a flatbed scanner willbest meet your needs.andM;Do You Redly Want to Do This?andM;Let's set something straight right away.andP;  Flatbed scanners aren't exactlyinexpensive.andP;  At $995, the portable Sharp JX-100 marks the low end of thescale (and it's actually a crossbreeding of a hand-held scanner and aflatbed) - you can get a used Mac for that kind of cash.andP;  At the other end ofthe spectrum is the $29,000 Varityper 1200 - you can get a brand-new Porschefor that kind of money! (Lest you think the Varityper over-priced, keep inmind that it comes as part of a complete system with an 8-megabyte Mac IIcx,a 210-megabyte hard-disk drive, and a Radius 19-inch gray-scale monitor.) Themiddle ground between these two extremes is the standard gray-scale scanner,which starts at around $1,600.andM;But your spending spree won't stop once you've selected a scanner.andP;  To takefull advantage of the images your scanner can produce, you'll want to add ahost of other peripherals to your Mac system.andP;  Detailed graphic imagesrequire a gray-scale or color monitor and a video board for display, scads ofsystem RAM for manipulation, a huge hard-disk drive for storage, and ahigh-resolution printer or film recorder for output.andP;  And when you tack onthe cost of specialized software packages for image editing or OCR (opticalcharacter recognition), the total investment rivals the annual city budget ofFargo, North Dakota.andM;If pondering such purchases makes your wallet whimper, consider some of thealternatives to flatbed scanners.andP;  Hand-held scanners cost hundreds, notthousands, of dollars (see &quot;Hand-Held Scanners&quot; elsewhere in our scannercoverage).andP;  Likewise, there are some bargains to be found in overheadscanners and video digitizers (see the &quot;Overhead Scanners&quot; and &quot;VideoDigitizers&quot; sidebars).andP;  And finally, don't forget about good old clip art.andO;There's a wealth of free electronic images in the public domain and anabundance of commercial packages from vendors such as 3G Graphics, T/Maker,and Dubl-Click.andM;Paper RouteandM;If you do decide to invest in a scanner, your choice is determined largely bywhat you plan to scan.andP;  Think about the type and quantity of material you'llbe scanning.andP;  With the exception of the portable Sharp JX-100, all flatbedscanners can process an entire letter-sized (8.5 x 11 -inch) original in onepass.andP;  If you want to scan legal-sized (8.5 x 14-inch) documents, youroptions narrow to five flatbeds: the Abaton Scan 300/GS, Apple Scanner,Microtek MSF-300GS, Microtek MSF-300Z, and UMAX UG80.andP;  And for those of youwho think really big, the Howtek Scanmaster and the Varityper 1200 both havebeds big enough for tabloid-sized (11 x 17-inch) originals.andM;If you have high-volume requirements, look for a scanner with either aremote-scan button or an automatic document feeder.andP;  Only the Apple Scanneroffers a remote-scan button, a handy feature that lets you initiate a scanwithout software intervention.andP;  You operate the scanner just as you do aphotocopy machine, simply pressing the scan button every time you insert anew page, but you must still manually feed each document into the scanner.andO;For unattended work, an automatic document feeder can pass a stack ofdocuments to the scanner one at a time.andP;  Only four vendors - Datacopy, DEST,Hewlett-Packard, and UMAX - offer optional automatic feeders for theirflatbed scanners, with prices ranging from $525 to $695.andP;  If you'll beprocessing lots of documents for OCR, you should investigate sheetfedscanners as an alternative to a flatbed model equipped with a document feeder(see the &quot;Sheetfed Scanners&quot; sidebar).andM;Getting 'Em GoingandM;Setting up scanners is usually a straightforward process.andP;  Plug in a powercord here and a cable there, and drop a file or two into the System Folder.andO;The Mac connection is achieved in one of four ways: straight SCSI (SmallComputer System Interface) connection, SCSI with a converter box, GPIB general-purpose interface bus) card in a NuBus slot, or connection to aserial port.andM;The majority of the scanners reviewed here are SCSI devices.andP;  The benefit ofSCSI is that it comes with all Macs since the Plus and is faster (anywherefrom 263K to 1,400K per second, depending on your Mac) than the serial port.andO;Three scanners - the Datacopy Model 830, Hewlett-Packard ScanJet Plus, andMicrotek MSF300Z - require a special box that converts their native signalsinto SCSI commands.andP;  Both Datacopy and Microtek include a SCSI converter withtheir scanners; Hewlett-Packard charges an extra $595.andM;Two scanners - the Howtek Scanmaster and the Sharp JX-300 - use a NationalInstruments' GPIB card that plugs into a NuBus slot in any Mac 11 and canaccept data at a rate of up to 600K per second.andP;  GPIB comes from thelaboratory-instrumentation world, so if you experience any installationproblems (as our technicians did during testing), be prepared to deal withcryptic error messages and obtuse documentation.andP;  Howtek bundles a GPIB withits Scanmaster; Sharp makes it a $570 option.andM;Finally, the diminutive Sharp JX-100 flatbed scanner plugs into either themodem port or the printer port.andP;  Perhaps Sharp took the serial route becausea SCSI controller would have added bulk to this portable unit.andP;  The trade-offis that the serial ports are relatively lethargic (5.7K per second) and thatan A-B switch box is necessary if your ports are already in use.andM;RAM GluttonsandM;In addition to considering various interfaces, you must be mindful of memoryneeds.andP;  Even though most scanner vendors claim that you can get away with aminimum of I or 2 megabytes of RAM, you'll probably need more to display andedit your images.andM;The larger the image and the more grays or colors, the higher your memoryrequirements climb.andP;  For example, an 8.5-x-11-inch image scanned at 300 dpiwith 256 gray levels gobbles up nearly 8.5 megabytes.andP;  And 24-bit-colorscanners have even more voracious memory appetites (see Table 1).andM;Luckily, most scanners save files to disk as they scan.andP;  Therefore, you canscan as large an image as you like, provided your hard disk has enough freespace to hold the resulting file.andP;  On the other hand, the Pentax SB-A4301Model 2 and both Sharp flatbeds (as well as the Truvel TZ-3 overhead) scan toRAM only.andP;  If the image you want can't fit into RAM, too bad.andP;  Even Virtualfrom Connectix, which should fool the system into seeing free hard-disk spaceas normal memory, doesn't let you get around this frustrating limitation.andO;This serious shortcoming dropped these scanners down a notch in our ratings.andM;Time TrialsandM;Although we made a point of mentioning the relative speeds of the variousinterfaces employed, the time spent acquiring an image is negligible whencompared with the amount of postscan time necessary to clean it up.andM;Our test system consisted of a Mac IIcx with 8 megabytes of RAM and a44-megabyte Bernoulli Box 11 44 drive running System 6.0.4.andP;  To measurespeed, we scanned identical images at each scanner's maximum resolution,using various pixel depths (pixel depth is the number of bits assigned toeach pixel to define its color or gray level).andP;  In general, the larger theimage and the more bits per pixel, the longer it takes to scan.andP;  For a 1-bitscan of an 8.5-x- 11 -inch document, the H-P ScanJet Plus was the fastest at20 seconds and the Howtek Scanmaster was the slowest at just under 3 minutes.andM;ResolutionandM;The detail a scanner can discern depends largely on its resolution, thenumber of discrete pixels, or picture elements, a scanner can see in a givenarea.andP;  Resolution is most commonly given as dpi (dots - or pixels - perinch).andP;  In general, the higher the resolution, the better the scanner is atpicking up detail such as tiny type and fine lines.andP;  High resolution isespecially necessary if you work primarily with detailed line art such asengineering and architectural drawings.andP;  That's because the jaggies are mostnoticeable on fine lines.andP;  The drawback of high-resolution scanners is thatthey may pick up unwanted detail, such as dust and scratches on youroriginals.andM;Although it's easy to be tempted by scanners that boast lofty resolutionrates, the resolution of most laser printers (300 dpi) is plenty for mostscanning needs.andP;  With three exceptions - the Sharp JX- 100 (200 dpi) and theAgfa Focus 11 800GSE and Varityper 1200 (both 400 dpi) - all the flatbedscanners evaluated here have a maximum resolution of 300 dpi.andP;  (If you needeven greater resolution, check out the 900-dpi Truvel TZ-3, discussed in the&quot;Overhead Scanners&quot; sidebar.)andM;Using a technique called intel-polation, or supersampling, some scanners cangive you resolutions higher than their stated maximum.andP;  The circuitryaverages an image's gray-scale values and places new pixels between theexisting ones.andP;  Interpolation doesn't add detail to a scan; it merelyperforms a smoothing function, providing better transitions between grays andreducing the jaggies (see Figure 1).andP;  Four of the scanners provideinterpolation capabilities: the Agfa Focus 11 800GSE (up to 800 dpi), theDEST PC Scan 3000 (600 dpi), the HP ScanJet Plus (600 dpi), and the Varityper1200 (1,200 dpi).andM;To test resolvability - how well scanners pick up details - we scanned theUSDC Image System Test Target in line-art mode at the highest true resolutionof each scanner (see Figure 2).andP;  (This test sheet, which is available fromthe Patent and Trademark Office, contains a series of shapes and line pairs,and text of varying sizes.) We then printed the scans at 800 percent on aLaserWriter and examined them for the smallest line pair in which our panelof judges could resolve at least two contiguous pairs of lines bothvertically and horizontally.andM;It should come as no surprise that the 400-dpi scanners fared better than the300-dpi units.andP;  The Varityper 1200 did the best, being able to resolve 8.0line pairs per millimeter.andP;  Of the 300dpi scanners, the DEST PC Scan 3000 andthe UMAX UG80 had the sharpest images.andP;  Worthy of note is that theinexpensive 200-dpi Sharp JX-100 did better than almost half of the 300dpiscanners.andM;Made in the ShadeandM;The number of grays a scanner can see depends on the amount of internalmemory it devotes to each pixel (see the &quot;How It Works: Monochrome andGray-Scale Scanners&quot; sidebar).andP;  Early monochrome scanners saw everything inblack-and-white, because they used only I bit per pixel.andP;  To simulate grays,monochrome scanners (and all scanners in 1-bit mode) employ a trick calleddithering, which combines adjacent black and white pixels into patterns thatlook like photographic halftones.andM;The advantages of scanning photographs in the black-and-white halftone modeare that the resulting file is much smaller than a gray-scale scan and thatit prints much faster, since the printer needn't convert gray scale tohalftone.andP;  The disadvantage is that the image is locked at the scanresolution and is therefore nearly impossible to edit or resize.andP;  For maximumediting flexibility, scanning in true gray-scale mode is best.andM;All 15 flatbed scanners reviewed here can capture real grays, because theyuse more than I bit to define each pixel.andP;  A 1-bit pixel can define twoshades: black and white.andP;  The more bits per pixel, the more shades of grayand the more realistic your scan.andP;  The Apple Scanner and Pentax SB-A4301Model 2 store 4 bits per pixel; thus, a pixel can be one of 16 shades ofgray.andP;  Likewise, the 6-bit Datacopy Model 830 can see 64 gray levels.andP;  Allthe others are 8-bit scanners and can generate the full range of 256 graylevels.andM;We knew that the Apple Scanner was a 4-bit unit, so we were surprised tolearn that it contains a Tokyo Electronic Company engine that can register 8bits of gray.andP;  Apple Scanner owners who want 256 gray levels should buyAbaton's 8-Bit Apple Upgrade ($595).andP;  Once it's installed by a fieldtechnician, this kit essentially turns the Apple Scanner into an Abaton Scan300/GS.andP;  (If you don't already have an Apple Scanner, it's morecost-effective to buy the Abaton Scan 300/GS).andP;  We evaluated the AppleScanner with and without the Abaton 8-Bit Apple Upgrade.andM;To test how well each scanner was able to distinguish among various levels ofgray, we scanned an industry-standard Kodak SR-37 test strip with 37 steps ofgray, from white to black.andP;  The resulting files were imported into AdobePhotoshop to measure the number of grays each scanner differentiated on thestrip.andM;As expected, the 4-bit units - the Apple Scanner and the Pentax SB-A4301Model 2 - came in in last place, recognizing only 16 different grays fromamong the 37 blocks the best you can expect of a 4-bit scanner.andO;Theoretically, the 8-bit scanners can distinguish among 256 levels of gray,so they should have no problem handling a lowly 37, right? Wrong.andM;The best of the 8-bit scanners the Apple Scanner with Abaton 8-B it AppleUpgrade, the Microtek MSF-300GS, and the Sharp JX-300 -could sense only 34 ofthe 37 gray levels (see Figure 3).andP;  What's going on'? We've stumbled onto oneof the little white lies of scanners.andP;  Because &quot;noise&quot; creeps into images,8-bit scanners offer only approximately 6 bits of accuracy.andP;  Don't get uswrong; they all try to give you 256 grays, but those grays aren't reallyaccurate.andM;For a real-world evaluation of each scanner's gray-scale ability, we used itsgreatest pixel depth at 150 dpi to scan a test image of a street scene.andO;These files were then printed on a Linotronic L300 at 1,270 dpi for ourjudges to examine for smooth shading, detail in shadows and highlights,realistic contrast, and focus (see Figure 4).andP;  The Truvel TZ-3 overhead andSharp JX-300 flatbed received the highest ratings from our panel; the PentaxSB-A4301 Model 2 and the Sharp JX-100 turned in the poorest performances.andM;Capturing ColorandM;Color has been slow to catch on in the scanner market, because - untilrecently - there have been few color applications to drive demand.andP;  Mostscanners are purchased for desktop publishing, where most work is done inblack-and-white.andP;  But if you're active in the emerging fields of multimediaor desktop presentations, you know the importance of color and the impact itcan make.andP;  For you, there are four flatbed scanners to choose from: theHowtek Scanmaster, the Microtek MSF-300Z, and the Sharp JX-100 and JX-300.andO;Of the four, the Sharp JX-100 has the smallest color range, with 6 bits percolor.andP;  Since there are three primary colors for each pixel, this translatesinto 18 bits per pixel.andP;  The other three color scanners are 8-bit-per-colormodels, each theoretically able to recognize 16,777,216 colors.andP;  However,color scanners suffer from the accuracy problems of gray-scale scannersmentioned earlier, so the color range of even the best scanners is in effectmuch smaller.andM;Actually, very little distinguishes color scanners from their gray-scalebrethren.andP;  The main difference is that color scanners scan images in threepasses, using colored filters  red, green, and blue) that attempt to simulatethe color sensitivity of the human eye.andP;  In fact, with the $399.95 Colorsetpackage from Studiotronics, all gray-scale scanners can produce color scans.andO;With Colorset, you use your scanner's existing software and scan an imagethree times, making one pass for each of the red, green, and blue filters inthe package.andP;  Once you've done this, the Colorset utility electronicallycombines the three gray-scale scans into one color file.andP;  Colorset is forpeople who want to extend the usefulness of gray-scale scanners they alreadyown, but its image quality can't compete with that of true color scanners,because of calibration problems, dust, and the like.andM;Testing the color scanners proved to be the most difficult of all the aspectsof our work on this report, because there is no known method of measuring theexact color of a scanned image.andP;  There are too many variables: the techniqueused to print the original, the scanner settings, differences in monitorphosphors, and inconsistencies in printed output.andP;  These factors interactwith one another to make it impossible to state that a particular scannerprovides the truest color reproduction.andP;  The best we can do is compare thescanners relative to one another.andM;Never ones to be daunted by an impossible task, the MacUser Labs techniciansdevised an ingenious method of measuring each scanner's relative ability toreproduce the entire range of human color vision.andP;  First we scanned theindustry-standard Kodak Ektacolor Plus Paper Reproduction Guide Q-60C (seeFigure 5).andM;The resulting files were imported into Adobe Photoshop to give us RGB (red,green, blue) values.andP;  These values were then mathematically mapped onto a CIEcolor space, an internationally accepted method of objectively describingcolor.andP;  Of the four color scanners, the inexpensive Sharp JX-100 had thepoorest accuracy.andP;  It had problems with oranges and saw yellows as overlydull.andP;  The other scanners all performed reasonably well.andM;No matter what numbers and charts tell us about scanner performance, thefinal arbiter must be a pair of eyes.andP;  If a scan doesn't look good, nobodycares how well it scores in laboratory tests.andP;  So to give us a real-worldassessment, our panel of judges compared test images from each of the colorscanners, produced by the best color-output device we had at our disposal, a2,540-dpi Compugraphic 9600.andP;  (You can't say we didn't give each colorscanner its best shot.)andM;The Sharp JX-300 output had the best overall look, with very realisticfleshtones (see Figure 5).andP;  The Howtek Scanmaster image was a bit dark, butthat's easy to tweak.andP;  You can either raise the scanner's brightness levelbefore scanning or use an image-editing program to increase the brightnessafter the fact.andP;  On the other hand, the Microtek MSF-300Z and Sharp JX-100images were both too red.andP;  This problem isn't as easy to fix, because if youcompensate for the red by changing the scanner's gamma curve (the colorresponse of the scanner at increasing light intensities), you invariablythrow off other colors in the process (see Figure 6).andP;  Keep in mind that therelative strengths and weakness that show up in real-world tests depend onthe image chosen.andP;  If we had used an image with a different range of colors,our judges might have noticed other peculiarities than those we've mentioned.andM;SoftwareandM;Because scanners don't have a lot of physical controls - knobs, switches, andso on - their software determines how easy they are to use.andP;  The softwarebundled with our tested scanners comes in three flavors: Das, applications,or plug-in drivers.andP;  Das are convenient, because they can be accessed at anytime, but they're usually not as full-featured as dedicated scanningapplications.andP;  Plug-in drivers tell popular image-editing applications suchas Digital Darkroom how to access particular scanners.andP;  Their benefit is thatyou can scan and edit in a single familiar application.andM;Scanner vendors seem to be of two minds when it comes to software.andP;  The firstgroup simply provides the basic tools necessary to acquire scans.andP;  If thescanner you choose has this limitation, make sure the software can save in aformat you can open in your favorite applications (see Table 2).andP;  The secondgroup goes one step further and includes software for manipulating scannedimages.andP;  For instance, Abaton and Microtek throw in Letraset's Imagestudioand Silicon Beach's Digital Darkroom with their scanners, whereas UMAX andVarityper bundle only the latter.andP;  Only the Agfa Focus 11 800GSE and thePentax SB-A4301 Model 2 come without any software whatsoever, so be preparedto spend several hundred dollars on a good scanning package if you decide tobuy either of these products.andM;Of the color scanners, the Microtek MSF-300Z comes with the least-complicatedsoftware.andP;  Its default settings provide rich, saturated scans, but there islittle you can do in the way of color correction - fine for laypeople whowant color scans but don't require precise accuracy.andP;  The MSF-300Z does,however, include PhotoMacEdit for color correction and separations after thescan.andM;Graphic-arts professionals will feel at home with the software bundled withthe Howtek and Sharp scanners.andP;  Though difficult to understand at first, thesoftware provides powerful gamma, brightness, and contrast controls.andP;  If youknow what you're doing and the effects you're looking for, these softwarepackages offer a tremendous amount of flexibility.andM;Read My TiffsandM;Aside from image acquisition for desktop-publishing work, the second mostcommon application for scanners is OCR (optical character recognition).andP;  Totest how well each scanner could read, we scanned normal, dark, light, andfaxed text - representative of documents scanned in a typical office.andP;  Thepages had different-colored backgrounds to test the ability of the scannersto provide an image that had good contrast under a range of conditions.andM;The TIFF files created by the scanners were imported into Caere's OmniPage toperform the text recognition.andP;  We timed how long it took OmniPage to convertthe image to a MacWrite II document and then used the MacWrite spellingchecker to count the errors in each file.andM;The Microtek MSF-300Z has the best recognition accuracy for white sheets butrequires tweaking of the brightness control to give acceptable OCR resultsfor brown and goldenrod sheets.andP;  On average, the UMAX UG80 and Varityper 1200had the lowest error rates for all five colored sheets.andP;  The HowtekScanmaster, Pentax SB-A4301 Model 2, and Agfa Focus 11 800GSE all performedbelow average.andP;  OmniPage was able to deal with UMAX TIFF files faster than itdealt with all others and took the most time with the files produced by theerror-prone Agfa Focus 11 800GSE.andM;Where We Stand on ScannersandM;The last time MacUser Labs evaluated scanners  &quot;Scanning the Color Horizon&quot;and &quot;Gray Expectations,&quot; June  89, pages 90 and 170, respectively),gray-scale scanner prices hovered around $2,000.andP;  Apple had yet to define32-bit QuickDraw, so there were few color models to choose from.andP;  Now priceshave dropped considerably, and 24-bit-color scanners are becoming morecommonplace.andP;  Since there is little mechanical difference between the two,expect to see even more color scanners and fewer gray-scale-only models inthe future.andP;  There are some fine products among today's offerings, but becareful, the pack also harbors a dog or two.andP;  Check &quot;The Bottom Line&quot; sidebarbefore you buy.andM;AcknowledgmentsandM;MacUser Labs would like to thank David Q. McDowell of the Eastman KodakCompany for test targets and assistance in devising color-accurachbenchmarks.andP;  Thanks also to X-Rite, Iomega, and Agfa Compugraphic for  testequipmentandM;Owen W. Linzmayer is a recently married San Francisco-basd free-lance writerspecializing in covering the Apple 11 and Macintosh communities.andM;Overhead ScannersandM;One scanning option you don't hear much about is the overhead, or copy-board,scanner.andP;  Although they're as flexible and useful as flatbed scanners,overhead scanners are more cumbersome and can suffer from illuminationproblems.andP;  Items to be scanned are placed faceup on an &quot;open air&quot; bed and arescanned by an optical mechanism, similar to a camera, that passes overhead ona small tower.andP;  Overhead scanners can handle loose sheets of paper any sizesmaller than the scanning bed, as well as bound books and low-profilethree-dimensional objects.andM;MacUser Labs tested three overhead scanners - the Chinon DS-3000, the MirrorVS300, and the Truvel TZ-3.andP;  The Truvel TZ-3 tied with the Agfa Focus 11800GSE flatbed scanner for the highest rating of all the scanners we tested.andO;it can handle documents as large as 12 x 17 inches at up to 8 bits per pixel.andO;Thanks to its adjustable zoom lens, the resolution of the Truvel TZ-3 can beset at 75 to 900 dpi, in one-dot increments.andP;  The higher the resolutionspecified, the smaller the image you can scan.andP;  Nonetheless, if it'sresolution you want, the Truvel TZ-3 wins hands down.andP;  it was capable ofresolving 1 1 line pairs per millimeter, and with its optional ($1,795) Zebraenhancement board installed, the Truvel was able to resolve 14 line pairs permillimeter! That's really, really small.andM;Resolution isn't the only area in which the Truvel TZ-3 blew the cover offflatbed scanners.andP;  Our five-person jury rated the halftone output of theTruvel better than that of any of the flatbed scanners as well as the othertwo overhead scanners.andP;  It was also tops in the SR-37 test, able todifferentiate among 35 of the 37 grays on the strip.andP;  On the negative side,the Truvel TZ-3 was one of the worst in evenness of illumination, despitebuilt-in fluorescent lights.andP;  Furthermore, it can scan only to RAM, therebylimiting the size of the images you can acquire.andM;If the Truvel's lofty price tag scares you off, consider one of the lessexpensive overhead scanner units - the Chinon DS-3000 or the Mirror VS300.andO;These 300-dpi monochrome scanners are identical-each uses a Chinon engine -except that the Chinon DS-3000 comes standard with a SCSI-converter box thatis a $197 Mirror option.andP;  Without the box, the scanners connect to one of theMacintosh's two RS-422 serial ports and are considerably slower thanSCSI-equipped units.andM;Both units rely on ambient light to illuminate originals lying in their8.5-x-11-inch beds, so contrast tends to be uneven.andP;  Although it's a bitpricier than the Chinon DS-3000, the Mirror VS300 does come with a one-yearwarranty (compared with the Chinon's 90 days) and includes Oiduvai's Read-it!andO;OCR package  $495) and Zedcor's DeskPaint ($99).andM;Both the Chinon DS-3000 and the Mirror VS300 ranked among the poorest flatbedscanners in the resolution test, resolving only four line pairs permillimeter; nonetheless, they performed admirably in the OCR tests.andP;  Althoughthey're not great, they are inexpensive, so if you're looking for acost-effective way to scan line art and text, the Chinon DS-3000 and theMirror VS300 deserve your attention.andM;Scanner Jeopardy: The answer is sheetfed scanner.andP;  The question: What's afast, low-cost device used mostly for OCR and fax scanning? As long asquality isn't your main concern, a sheetfed scanner can also inputline-artand even gray-scale images.andP;  But before you're stuck with an expensivedoorstop, you'll need to answer some more questions: Are your sheets mostlystandard- or legal-sized? Are they standard weight, very thin, or very thick?andO;Do you want to scan single sheets or load a tray and let the scanner rununattended?andM;The implications of these questions became clear when we looked at thefeatures and limitations of four sheetfed scanners and one variation on thetheme.andP;  The resolution was fairly consistent, at a respectable four linepairs per millimeter at 300 dpi - features of sheetfed scanners vary morethan performance.andM;The DEST PC Scan 2000 has a horizontal, single-sheet input tray, but theoptional multisheet feeder can handle 35 sheets, The paper path makes a180-degree turn, so watch out for extra-thick sheets or photographs.andP;  Small3-x-3-inch sheets scan without mishap, but nothing wider than 8.5 inches canfit - a limitation that barred entry inches wide.andP;  Maximum resolution is 300dpi, and 16 levels of gray are available in addition to line-art and halftonesettings.andM;The Complete PC Page Scanner also has a paper tray with a single-sheetlimitation, and again the tray was too narrow f or our resolution test sheet.andO;The paper path is relatively straight, and 3-x-3-inch sheets are no problem.andO;Only line art and halftones are possible, at up to 300-dpi true resolution400-dpi interpolated).andM;The Datacopy JetReader 220 has a fairly straight paper path and a paper traywide enough for our resolution test sheet, and it accepts a 10-sheet tray.andO;The 3-x-3-inch sheet lost its way inside the scanner and had to be removedmanually.andP;  You can select line art, halftone, or 16 levels of gray at amaximum resolution of 300 dpi.andM;The Microtek MS-11 has a rated capacity of 50 sheets, and our test traysnever jammed.andP;  The paper path is short and straight and easily handles3-x-3-inch sheets.andP;  The glossy surface of our resolution test sheet was tooslippery for the MS-11's paper-feed mechanism, however, resulting indistortion of output images.andP;  Only line-art and halftone settings aresupported - at up to 300 dpi - and TIFF, PICT, and EPS formats are available.andM;Although it's not strictly a sheetfed scanner, we couldn't ignore theingenious Thunderware ThunderScan.andP;  This low-cost scanning alternative issimply a scanning head that mounts over the print head of your ImageWriter orimagewriter 11.andP;  It's cute but agonizingly slow: A single-sheet scan can takeup to 20 minutes, versus 15 to 30 seconds with the other four sheetfedscanners.andP;  Thick sheets are susceptible to scratches f rom the scanning head,and glossy sheets do not scan well.andP;  A maximum resolution of 288 dpi and 32gray levels are featured, and TIFF, PICT, EPS, and paint output formats aresupported.andP;  The basic setup is only $249, but you need a $49 PowerAccessoryif your Mac belongs to the Mac 11 family.andP;  Thunderware, Inc., 21 Orinda Way,Orinda, CA 94563; (415) 254-6581.andM;Scanners are great for getting images from paper to screen, but they fallflat when you want a picture of a skyscraper.andP;  To capture realworldthree-dimensional images, you need a video digitizer.andP;  Video digitizerscreate graphics files from standard video sources including camcorders, VCRS,still-video cameras, and laserdisc players.andM;Video digitizers open up interesting new input avenues, but their resolutionand color quality are limited by a video source that can't compete with printor film.andP;  Most can capture an entire video frame in as little as 1/30 second.andO;Digital Vision sacrificed speed for economy when it created ComputerEyesColor ($450), the lowest-priced 24-bit video digitizer for the Mac 11 family.andO;Unlike frame-grabbing digitizers that essentially take video snapshots,Computer-Eyes takes six seconds to capture a 640-x-480-pixel 24-bit-colorimage from a static source.andP;  its NuBus card has an RCA-type phono jack forcommon NTSC (National Television Standards Committee) signals and a 4-pinmini-DIN connector for S-video devices such as Super VHS and Hi-Band 8mmrecorders.andP;  A similar monochrome model for compact Macs, ComputerEyes B/W($250), plugs into the RS-422 serial port and captures 8-bit-gray-scaleimages.andP;  Digital Vision, 270 Bridge St., Dedham, MA 02026; (800) 346-0090 or(617) 329-5400.andM;Koala Technologies' MacVision ($499) has recently received an upgrade.andP;  Oneof the first Mac video digitizers, MacVision accepts both NTSC and PAL(phase-alternatingline-the European video standard) signals.andP;  Because itconnects to the serial port, it is somewhat slow, but it can create 8-bitimages of up to 640 x 480 pixels.andP;  The upgraded MaeVision comes with improvedimage-editing software.andP;  Koata Technologies, 70 N. 2nd St., San Jose, CA95113; (408) 287-6311.andM;The Aapps MicroTV ($395) is a black-and-white television on a NuBus card thatdisplays real-time video in a Mac 11 window (see review, May '90, page 54).andO;A tap of the space bar copies any MicroTV frame into the Clipboard as a256-x-216-pixel PICT2 image with 128 gray levels.andP;  The MicroTV Professionalmodel ($595) can display and capture images four times larger, and a colormodel is in the works.andP;  Aapps, 756 N.
