Police said 25people were killed and 54 wounded.   Also Saturday, the International Red Cross began pulling out itsSwiss staff from Lebanon, 10 days after one of its employees waskidnapped in Sidon.   Sources at the International Committee for the Red Cross inBeirut said the all-Swiss organization will close its operationthroughout Lebanon if Peter Winkler, head of the Sidon office, isnot freed by Dec. 3.   The ultimatum came as fighting intensified between the rivalmilitias. The pro-Syrian Amal militia drove out the fundamentalistHezbollah, backed by Iran, from most of west Beirut on the secondday of street battles, police reported.   ``We've finished them. We killed all 11 Hezbollahis who wereterrorizing the whole neighborhood by sniper fire,'' said the localAmal commander who identified himself only as Bahij.   A police spokesman said 25 people were killed and 54 wounded inthe last 24 hours in the fighting between Hezbollah, or Party ofGod, and Amal, Arabic for hope. That raised the overall toll to 35dead and 74 wounded since the conflict began in Beirut's southernslums Wednesday.   The fighting moved into central city districts Friday.   Winkler, 32, was kidnapped from his car by three unidentifiedgunmen on Nov. 17. No group claimed responsibility.   The Sidon Red Cross office shut down on Wednesday to protestWinkler's abduction. Three of its staff left Saturday for Geneva,leaving about 28 in the country, said the Red Cross sources, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   Police believe the Fatah-Revolutionary Council faction led byPalestinian terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal carried out thekidnapping on behalf of Hezbollah, which has no presence in Sidon.   Abu Nidal's organization has claimed responsibility for scores ofterrorist attacks, including those at Rome and Vienna airports inDecember 1985.   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council has long been allied withHezbollah, which is believed to be the umbrella for fundamentalistShiite factions holding most of the foreign hostages, including nineAmericans.   In Sidon, a southern port city, Lebanese and foreign humanitarianorganizations went on strike Saturday to protest Winkler's abductionand the apparent kidnapping of Belgian doctor Jan Cools.   Cools, 32, disappeared May 21 after leaving his apartment in aPalestinian refugee camp near the southern port of Tyre, 25 milessouth of Sidon.   He worked at the camp for Norwac, a Norwegian humanitarian group,for three months before he vanished. No group has claimedresponsibility.   Gilbert Holleufer, International Red Cross spokesman in Lebanon,said the suspension of activities in Sidon will cut back assistancefor war-disabled people at a Red Cross orthopedic center there. TheSwiss technicians have left.   In Beirut, the estimated 12,000 Syrian troops in charge ofsecurity in the city's Moslem sector offered safe conduct forsurrendering Hezbollahis but made no serious effort to stop thefighting.   The new clashes between Hezbollah and Amal, struggling fordominance of the 1 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest sect, alsoappeared to reflect growing strain between Syria and Iran. TheSyria-Iran alliance has weakened since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in theeight-year war between Iran and Iraq.   Police said that by Saturday afternoon Amal had evicted Hezbollahfrom eight west Beirut districts and was closing in on theirmilitants in the three other neighborhoods.   About 25 Hezbollah gunmen were seen surrendering to Syrian troopsin the Zokak Blatt district after Amal fighters surrounded them in ahigh school.   The Hezbollah fighters handed over their weapons to a Syrian armycaptain, who sent them off in seven private cars. The officerrefused to talk to reporters.   The Amal leader in Zokak Blatt, Ayman Shirri, said the Hezbollahfighters were being taken to the Iranian Embassy ``where theybelong.''</TEXT></DOC>
