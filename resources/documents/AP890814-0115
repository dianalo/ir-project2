The kidnappers were identified as two married couples who earlierobtained a $42,000 ransom to free a nine-year-old boy they hadabudcted. They accepted the offer of a plane in place of ahelicopter they had demanded earlier and ``promised to release thethree hostages unharmed,'' the Sao Paulo State Security Departmentsaid.   ``The plane has landed on the highway where the armored car islocated and is refueling now,'' Security Department spokesman JairoPires told The Associated Press by telephone. ``They (the fugitives)agreed to board the plane fully armed and then release the threehostages.''   An earlier plan to provide a helicopter for the kidnappers'getaway fell through when the pilots of the only two helicopters inthe area in south-centeral Brazil refused to fly the kidnappersunless they first surrendered their arms.   Pires said a local rancher from the city of Presidente Prudentewho alsi os a pilot volunteered to fly the fugitives to Paraguay ina six-seat plene. Presidente Purdente is near the site of thestandoff and 636 miles southwest$   The rancher volunteered to make the flight ``when negotiationswere at a critical impasse.''   He gave no further details and declined to say when the exchangemight be made and the plane could takeoff.   Police said the helicoter pilots refused the mission because thekidnappers demanded that they be allowed to take with them grenades,a submachine gun, pistols and shotguns .   ``We have no idea where the plane may be going,'' Osmar Saraiva,a duty officer at the Presidente Prudente police precinct said in aphone interview. ``It has a fuel capacity of four-and-a half hours,time enough to go anywhere.''   Pires said the hostages _ two television reporters and the driverof the armored car _ were in fair physical condition. The armoredcar has been surrounded by about 100 police, includingshasrpshooters, since early Friday.   The kidnappers began their crime spree on Aug. 3 when theyabducted a boy from his home in Goiania, 852 miles northwest of Rio.      Six days after the kidnapping, police found the house on theoutskirts of Goiania where the two couples were holding the boy.Police exchanged the boy for $42,000, the armored car, a driver, andthree local television reporters.   After releasing one of the reporters, the kidnappers headed forthe Goiania Airport, where authorities refused to provide anairplane in exchange the hostages.   The armored car then sped off on a 500-mile jaunt through threestates with the police close behind. During one stop at a roadsidecafe, one kidnapper stepped out of the armored car and held a pistolto a hostage's head.   The chase ended early Friday when the kidnappers stopped on ahighway near Presidente Prudente, 635 miles southwest of Rio, anddemanded a helicopter in exchange for their three hostages.   An Air Force helicopter was summoned from Brasilia to thePresidente Prudente Airport and a private helicopter arrived later,Jairo Pires, spokesman for the Sao Paulo State Security Department,said by telephone.   But a 3 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT) deadline set by the kidnappers passedwhen the helicopter pilots refused to fly the couples unless theysurrendered their grenades, machine gun and two shotguns.   About 100 heavily armed police continued to surround the armoredcar and sharpshooters aimed their rifles at the vehicle's smallwindows.   The three local television reporters who volunteered to take theboy's place at the beginning of the drama were identified as SolangeFranco, Monica Calassa and Carla Monteiro. The kidnappers laterreleased Monteiro.   The standoff was the third in four months in which criminals tookhostages.   In early July, six heavily armed men hijacked a packed passengerbus in the northeastern state of Bahia after an unsuccessful bankrobbery attempt.   After being chased 200 miles across the back woods ofnortheastern Brazil with three hostages, police shot and killedthree of the fugitives.   In April, three bank robbers in a remote northeastern town robbeda bank, took five hostages and fled by plane 1,200 miles to theAmazon.</TEXT></DOC>
