Troops have killed at least 95 people in massive anti-governmentprotests since Sein Lwin became president on July 27, the radiosaid. The People's Assembly elected him to replace Ne Win, whoresigned after 26 years in power.   However, Western diplomats said the death toll may be in thehundreds, and unconfirmed reports reaching Bangkok put the figureas high as 1,000.   The broadcast gave no reason for the resignation, and nosuccessor was immediately named. The radio said a special meetingof both the central committee of the Burma Socialist Program Partyand the People's Assembly would meet next Friday.   Earlier today, a Burmese guerrilla leader called on rebel groupsto launch a nationwide offensive against Sein Lwin's government.   Soldiers in one town reportedly turned against the governmentand allowed thousands of protesters to march through the streets.   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidBurmese security forces were trying to get rid of evidence ofcivilian deaths by burning bodies.   Radio Rangoon said the 92nd meeting of the party's centralcommittee today accepted Sein Lwin's resignation as the partychairman, by far the most powerful political position in thecountry.   The report also said the Council of State accepted hisresignation as president of the republic and from membership of thePeople's Assembly.   Students initially led the anti-government demonstrations, whichalso demand a return to democracy and economic reforms, but widesectors of the population later joined in the bloody street battles.   Sein Lwin, 64, a former military officer, was held responsibleby demonstrators for brutal suppression of student demonstrationsin March and June as well as his predecessor's earlier crackdown ondissidents.   Demonstrators chanted slogans and carried placards through thestreets of Rangoon calling Sein Lwin ``a dog,'' ``a butcher'' and``a Nazi.''   But the radio said there were virtually no demonstrations inRangoon today. It said protesters also dispersed in the NorthOkkalapa suburbs, where workers and others have battled troops inrecent days.   But a Thai official speaking on condition of anonymity, said 200soldiers and 100 policemen stayed inside while thousands ofdemonstrators marched freely through Victoria Point in Burma'ssouthernmost province of Megui for a third straight day today.Radio Rangoon denied that Victoria Point, a market town of about5,000 people, had been taken over by protesters.   Brang Seng, leader of a coalition of Burmese guerrilla groups,called for an offensive ``from north to south'' to push the armyfrom dozens of towns and cities in Burma.   A spokesman quoted the guerrilla leader as saying rebels wouldattack government troops and calling on them to join in battlingthe government. Rebels fighting for autonomy control vast areas ofthe country.   The spokesman, who refused to give his name, read the statementover the telephone from Burma.   Brang Seng is leader of the Kachin army, one of the ethnic-basedrebel groups in the National Democratic Front coalition. Thecoalition claims to field about 35,000 rebel fighters. The nineother rebel groups in the coalition could not be immediatelyreached for comment.   A senior Western diplomat in Burma, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said Thursday that the actual death toll from therioting may be in the hundreds. He said solid information wasvirtually impossible to get, partly because soldiers and protesterswere fighting a ``battle for the bodies.''   ``When someone is killed, (the protesters) try to get it, sothey can display the bodies, and the government tries to get it tocremate it'' so there would be no evidence of deaths, he said.   He said the leadership, accustomed to undisputed rule, simplydoes not know how to handle the disturbances and has assumed thatif enough force is applied, the demonstrators will simply go away.   Protesters have turned more violent, responding to unprovokedkillings by security forces who shot into crowds to disperse them.The protesters, mostly students, Buddhist monks and young people,are getting ``100 percent support'' from the public, the diplomatsaid.   Prime Minister Tun Tin went on the radio Thursday to say that aspromised, the government will urgently carry out economic reformsto boost living conditions. Reforms can't be implemented in thecurrent violence, he said.   It was the government's first hint of concessions since SeinLwin assumed power in the impoverished nation of 38 million people.Diplomats say economic problems, caused by Ne Win's isolationistpolicies, are among the reasons for the uprising.   With a per capita income of less than $200, Burma is one of theworld's poorest nations. Inflation is soaring and the country has aforeign debt of $4 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
