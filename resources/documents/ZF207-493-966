A1500-meter limit applies to most metallic cable systems, but itdoes not apply to a LAN system with microwave links.andP;  Signalstraveling at the speed of light are 1.2 to 1.6 times faster thansignals through cable, allowing information to be sent up to 5800meters over microwave while still conforming to IEEE 802.3specifications.andP;  Soon, microwave extensions for LANs will belimited only by atmospheric conditions, so that LAN extensionswill provide transmissions for distances greater than ten miles.andO;Microwave Networks will introduce a microwave interface, some timein 1989, that will take full advantage of a microwave link'sfull-duplex capabilities.andP;  Microwave is already a good option, andit is getting better.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Microwave CommunicationsBridges (Connector)Local Area Networks.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   The major elements of a microwave LAN extension.
