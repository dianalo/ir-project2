(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge's ruling in a divorce battle overseven frozen human embryos that life begins at conception mustwithstand the test of higher courts before it sets a precedent inthe debate over reproductive rights, law specialists said Friday.   ``It's one decision at this point,'' said Elizabeth Bartholet, anexpert in family and reproductive law at Harvard Law School.   Neil P. Cohen of the University of Tennessee Law School said theultimate decision will be determined by higher appellate courts,perhaps even the U.S. Supreme Court.   ``And those are the decisions we'll look to for guidance on thisissue,'' he said.   Lori Andrews, medical law projects director at the American BarFoundation in Chicago, said that even in this formative stage,Circuit Judge W. Dale Young's decision Thursday in the case of MarySue Davis vs. Junior Lewis Davis will have to be weighed carefullyby judges facing similar issues.   ``When he started this case he had nothing to look to forprecedent, and so other judges will at least have to turn first towhat he said,'' Ms. Andrews said. ``So it will be very widely read.It will be very influential.''   In a 57-page decision, Young plotted out his conclusion that lifebegins at conception, relying on the testimony of a Frenchgeneticist and a federal appeals court decision in Florida affirmingthe use of DNA fingerprinting in court.   The judge ruled that seven embryos conceived by the Davisesoutside the womb through in vitro fertilization were people, notproperty, and he awarded temporary custody to Mrs. Davis to bringthem to term.   Junior Davis, who had fought to be part of any decision on thedisposition of the embryos and not to be forced to become a fatheragainst his consent, said he would appeal to the Tennessee Court ofAppeals and potentially beyond.   Young said after issuing the decision that he would welcomereview by a higher court.   Typically, it takes cases two to three years to travel theappellate route through the Tennessee appeals court and then thestate Supreme Court, and even longer if the case continues to theU.S. Supreme Court.   Janet Mayfield, the attorney handling Davis' appeal, said a stateSupreme Court ruling could come sooner if the courts agree toexpedite the proceedings for medical reasons.   Davis' attorneys said they will seek a stay of Young's orderpreventing Mrs. Davis from implanting the embryos until the appealsare over. There has been some question about how long the sevenfrozen embryos would remain viable.   However, Dr. I. Ray King, who oversees the Knoxville clinic wherethe embryos are stored, said, ``From our standpoint, there would notbe a time restraint that we know of. In other species we can go fiveto 10 years easily. I would expect in humans, it is probably goingto be similar to that.''   There is also a question of whether the Tennessee appellatecourts will address directly the question of when life begins.``Usually judges want to decide something on its narrowest groundsand not open up a Pandora's box,'' Mayfield said.   She said Davis' appeal would focus on the apparent conflictbetween Young's decision awarding custody to Mrs. Davis with statelaw requiring both parents to consent to donating the organs oftheir children and a state policy requiring the reporting of deathsand miscarriages that doesn't mention embryos.   Even without appellate review, Ms. Andrews of the Bar Foundationsuggested the decision, though at this point applying strictly toYoung's jurisdiction, could prompt an array of legal cases elsewhereon the grounds that embryos are persons.   Some possibilities: Inheritance disputes, doctors unwilling toperform in vitro procedures for fear of being accused of murder ifall of the implanted embryos fail to come to term _ the success ratetypically is one in five _ and even tax disputes on whether frozenembryos can be counted as dependents on tax returns.   If the ruling withstands appellate review, the dimensions couldbe even larger, further limiting in vitro fertilization practicesand potentially entering the area of abortion rights.   The U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision giving womenthe right to an abortion did not address the issue of when lifebegins and failed to find constitutional grounds for considering afetus a person.   ``But the philosophy that would say that life begins atconception would also say it's appropriate for the state tointervene in the woman's decision about what to do with thatpregnancy as early as day one,'' Ms. Bartholet of Harvard said.   ``And the same court that came down with this decision wouldpresumably say in the context of abortion that it is OK for thestate to prohibit abortion from day one. And Roe vs. Wade clearlysays the opposite of that,'' she said.   Young said his decision was not concerned with abortion law, butas Ms. Andrews put it, ``This case has created more potential legalproblems than it has solved.''</TEXT></DOC>
