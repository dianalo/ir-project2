Like many defense contractors, HRB's sales have declinedin recent years because of &quot;the breakout of peace,&quot; saidHadson President J. Michael Adcock, explaining why the unit'svalue dropped 50%. In 1989, the unit had sales of about $113million, down from about $140 million only two years earlier,Mr. Adcock said.</LP><TEXT>   He stressed, however, that &quot;HRB remains a good solidcompany,&quot; and that its sale is part of a larger Hadsonstrategy to reduce debt and concentrate on producing andsupplying energy products and facilities, the primarybusiness of Oklahoma City-based Hadson.   HRB will give E-Systems, a maker of defense electronicssystems, &quot;access to new customers, emerging programs, andsynergistic opportunities which we expect will result in apositive future contribution to our earnings,&quot; said E.G.Keiffer, chairman and chief executive of E-Systems. He addedthat HRB &quot;will further complement and expand our position inthe advanced intelligence and reconnaissance systemsmarketplace, an area which we believe has and will becomeincreasingly important.&quot; HRB, based in State College, Pa.,employs about 1,300.   Mr. Adcock said Hadson established reserves in the secondquarter large enough to cover the loss on the sale of HRB. Ofthe $147 million, or $3.71-a-share, loss that Hadson reportedfor the second quarter, about $144 million came fromdiscontinued operations. In the year-earlier quarter, thecompany had a loss of $2.7 million, or seven cents a share,after taking a $2.8 million loss on discontinued operations.Revenue in the quarter fell to $106.5 million from $130.2million.   E-Systems reported six-month earnings of $35.9 million, or$1.15 a share, compared with $38.5 million, or $1.24 a share,a year earlier. Sales rose to $896 million from $791 million.</TEXT></DOC>
