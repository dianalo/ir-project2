The exchange offer from New Century Communications Inc.,the New York-based parent holding company of EdgellCommunications, follows a deteriorating situation at thepublishing and trade show company. Founder Robert Edgellunexpectedly resigned in March as chief executive. And thecompany did not make a $7 million interest payment tobondholders on July 16.</LP><TEXT>   Cleveland-based Edgell, one of the country's largest trademagazine publishers and a growing force in the tradeexposition field, continues to operate with substantialprofit margins, Edgell executives said. But revenue frommagazines and trade shows have not grown as expected, and thecompany can't keep up with interest payments.   Richard B. Swank, the recently appointed chief executiveofficer of Edgell, said that as part of the restructuringplan, as many as eight Edgell magazines have been pegged forsale.   Edgell Communications was formed in 1987, when Mr. Edgellled management in a $334.1 million leveraged buy-out of thebusiness publications and school supplies unit of HarcourtBrace. The buy-out was financed by Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., aunit of General Electric Co., and General Electric CapitalCorp., another GE unit, which remains the majority owner ofEdgell. Traditionally profitable but unglamorous, Edgell'strade magazines include Urology Times, Pipeline andamp; GasJournal, and Food Management, as well as 52 other titles.   In the exchange offer made last week, Edgell is proposinga change in the amortization schedule on a $185 million loanfrom General Electric Credit Corp. Edgell is asking thatinterest payments on the loan be delayed and spread out overa period of time. Edgell is also proposing that institutionsthat own about $100 million in high-yield junk bonds exchangetheir bonds for equity in the company. Edgell's buy-out wasalso backed by $5 million from private investors, as well asabout $8 million in cash and $45 million in preferred sharesfrom Kidder, Peabody.   The deadline for the exchange offer is Aug. 30. NeitherKidder nor General Electric would comment on the exchangeoffers.   Edgell is still a &quot;good company,&quot; Mr. Swank said, which heclaimed has operating profit margins of more than 20% inmagazines and more than 35% in the trade show business.</TEXT></DOC>
