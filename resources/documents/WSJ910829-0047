The 10-megawatt electric generating facility -- enoughpower for about 5,000 customers -- will heat molten salt asthe first step to conventional generation by steam turbine.</LP><TEXT>   The project will be built and managed by a consortium ofutilities led by Southern California Edison Co., a unit ofSCEcorp. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power andthe Sacramento Municipal Utility District will alsoparticipate. Other investors are being sought.   The federal Department of Energy will pay half the cost ofthe facility, which has been dubbed Solar Two.   Solar Two will update a $140 million solar plant operatedfor five years near Barstow, Calif., 140 miles east of LosAngeles. The plant was closed in 1989 after proving to beuneconomic.   The Solar Two experiment will use the same field ofcomputer-controlled mirrors to direct the sun's rays to atower where molten salt will be heated to 1050 degreesFahrenheit. The molten salt, in turn, will be used to makesteam to turn a conventional turbine generator. The moltensalt can be stored to allow generating from the system atnight.   Construction of the facility will be completed by 1994,Southern California Edison said.</TEXT></DOC>
