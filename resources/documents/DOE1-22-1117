It was concluded that undersuch disposal conditions carbon steel would not be subject to localisedcorrosion or hydrogen embrittlement, and therefore the study concentratedon evaluating the rate of general attack. This was carried out by developinga mechanistically based mathematical model which was formulated on theconservative assumption that the corrosion would be under activationcontrol, and would not be impeded by the formation of corrosion productlayers. This model predicted that an allowance of 33 mm would be requiredfor a 1000 year life.</TEXT></DOC>
