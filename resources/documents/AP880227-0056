The Coast Guard said Friday that it has lifted a restriction andwill permit the Khian Sea into harbor. The Coast Guard had barredthe ship because its Liberian registery expired, but spokeswomanElizabeth Brannan said of the problem, ``it's all worked out.''   She said the ship, carrying 15,000 tons of incinerator ash, wasexpected to arrive at the mouth of the Delaware Bay early Monday.   The state Department of Environmental Resources said it wouldnot allow the Khian Sea to unload until the ash had been tested forhazardous chemicals.   ``If the ash tests are hazardous, it must be disposed of ashazardous material. If it isn't, it can be landfilled,'' saiddepartment spokesman Paul Ciotta.   Philadelphia incinerator ash has not been found to be hazardousin the past by government standards, but the environmental groupGreenpeace has contended the ash is toxic.   Greenpeace has been tracking the ship's unsuccessful efforts todispose of its refuse in the Bahamas, Bermuda, the DominicanRepublic, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti and Honduras, and making it thecenter of a campaign against exporting waste from the United States.   ``The City of Brotherly Love must take responsibility for itsash crisis, and not dump it on developing countries,'' said JimVallette of Greenpeace USA.   Faced with a shortage of affordable landfill space, the cityhired a contractor, Joseph Paolino andamp; Sons, Inc. of Philadelphia, todispose of the ash.   The Khian Sea set sail Sept. 5, 1986.   A second ship, the Bark, loaded with about 14,000 tons of cityash, left Philadelphia Feb. 5, bound for Haiti, according to thePhiladelphia Maritime Exchange. Greenpeace said Friday it learnedfrom shipping industry sources that the Bark arrived in Haiti onFeb. 23.</TEXT></DOC>
