The purchase price represents a discount of about 37% froman earlier Rio Algom offer made in 1989. That offer, laterwithdrawn, was for $10.20 a share after adjustment for aconsolidation of Uranium Resources' shares. The two miningconcerns resumed takeover talks last month.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I suspect the uranium market was depressed for so longthat the insiders {of Uranium Resources} were anxious to takethe money and run,&quot; said Ken Friedman, an analyst atBoettcher andamp; Co. in Denver.   Uranium Resources management control about 52% of thecompany's shares.   &quot;We believe the cash merger transaction is very favorablefor {Uranium Resources} shareholders and employees in view ofpresent and anticipated uncertain uranium market conditions,&quot;Raymond Larson, chairman and chief executive officer ofUranium Resources, said in a statement.   The acquisition of Uranium Resources would giveToronto-based Rio Algom access to lower-cost uraniumproduction. In addition, Uranium Resources, based in Dallas,has perfected a method of extracting uranium by dissolvingthe mineral from the ore while it is still in the ground. RioAlgom has been experimenting with similar technology at aWyoming property.   The transaction is subject to regulatory and otherapprovals.</TEXT></DOC>
