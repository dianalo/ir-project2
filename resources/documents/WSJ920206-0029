Oneof his main selling points was that Venezuela is a stabledemocracy that offers less risk than most of its neighbors.   Now, in the wake of a failed coup attempt againstPresident Carlos Andres Perez, Mr. Broslat admits that hewould have to rewrite his script. But he says he would stillinsist that Venezuela is a safe country in which to invest.</LP><TEXT>   In fact, he says, democracy has come out strengthened, andso has Mr. Perez. &quot;We went through a test of fire, and we gotthrough it,&quot; says Mr. Broslat. His confidence exemplifies thegiddy mood reigning in Venezuela's business community as thecountry quickly returned to normalthough armored vehicles andsoldiers still surrounded the Miraflores presidential palace,and there were fresh rumors of rioting here last night.   Businessmen and bankers acknowledge that the uprisingcould lead some investors to have second thoughts and couldthreaten this year's macroeconomic targets, but they stressthat the quick and decisive crushing of the coup attemptassures the continuation of economic reforms that have putVenezuela in the forefront of South America's free-marketrevolution.   &quot;This was an unfortunate, unnecessary and unwanted event,but Venezuela's momentum is such that it is just a stumblingblock on the way to its becoming a more prosperous country,&quot;says Stephen Fellows, president of the American-VenezuelanChamber of Commerce.   Adds Andres Sosa Pietri, president of the huge state-ownedoil company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.: &quot;What will this doto business? I think it will do nothing.&quot;   Financial markets remained closed yesterday to prevent awave of panic trading, making it difficult to verify whetherinvestors shared this optimism. But the value of Venezuela'sdebt on the secondary market stayed virtually stable, and Mr.Broslat says no investors have defected from Corrimon'soffering.   But while they are confident the country's free-marketreforms will be preserved, many here also say that the failedcoup is likely to force Mr. Perez to loosen his tight fiscaland monetary policies in order to increase social spending.   Indeed, while the coup leaders never clearly explainedtheir aims, analysts say they were trying to capitalize on abroad wave of discontent that has led to a series of protestsby students and teachers over price rises and poor pay.   Through a series of belt-tightening measures, includingcuts in subsidies, Mr. Perez managed to bring inflation downto 30% last year from 89% three years ago, while balancingthe budget and doubling reserves to $14 billion.   &quot;The coup attempt was a wake-up call to spend more moneyon social programs that have been delayed,&quot; says a bankerhere. &quot;I expect this year we will have more distribution ofincome, and this will have an effect on reserves, the fiscaldeficit, inflation and the currency.&quot;   But paradoxically, this could speed up some of Mr. Perez'sfree-market moves, some say. Mr. Perez will have to find newsources of revenue to fund increased social spending. Thiscould mean more privatization following the successfulsell-offs last year of assets such as telecommunicationscompany CANTV to a consortium headed by GTE Corp., and theairline Viasa to Spain's Iberia.</TEXT></DOC>
