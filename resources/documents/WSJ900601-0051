The department said Nynex willfully provided informationservices through its Telco Research Corp. unit, a smallsoftware company based in Knoxville, Tenn. Specifically,Telco Research provided MCI Communications Corp. with aservice that allowed MCI to gain access to Telco Researchcomputer facilities and obtain information on the cheapestway to configure telecommunications networks for customers.The department said the service was illegally providedbetween April 11, 1986, and February 1987.</LP><TEXT>   A Nynex spokesman said the company believes there is noviolation of the consent decree, and that the charge iswithout merit. Nynex, he said, had discontinued thearrangement with MCI early in 1987 &quot;to eliminate any policyquestion.&quot; Indeed the company said that in May 1986 it hadcalled the activity to the Justice Department's attention toavoid any possible problems.   Besides, the spokesman said, Telco's revenue from theoperation was a minuscule part of Nynex's business and thatit was &quot;clearly ludicrous&quot; to believe that Nynex wouldwillfully risk a criminal charge over the revenue. Heestimated the revenue amounted to &quot;less than 2% of the annualrevenue of Telco Research and less than 1/1000 of 1% of Nynexrevenue overall&quot; in 1986.   The Justice Department investigation began in late 1986after Scott Rafferty, a lawyer who was hired by Nynex to headup Telco's consulting operation, questioned Telco'scompliance with the consent decree. Mr. Rafferty, who wasdismissed by the company when it folded the consultingoperation, complained to the Justice Department late in 1986,alleging violations of the consent decree's ban on providinginformation services.   Apparently some within Nynex weren't completely confidentthat all of Telco's activities clearly fell within the boundsof the consent decree. In a November 1986 memo writtenshortly after Telco officials decided to withdraw from theconsulting business and fired Mr. Rafferty, Barbara Morris, aNynex lobbyist and wife of Rep. Norman Lent (R., N.Y.), wrotethat Mr. Rafferty had questioned a corporate lawyer aboutwhether the activities were legal.   The lawyer, Ms. Morris wrote, &quot;told Scott they were buttold me he's not so sure. . . . There was room forinterpretation and Nynex interpreted in its own favor. Aclose look by someone else could result in differentconclusion.&quot;   Mr. Rafferty has filed suit against the company, includinga recent action under the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations law.   The Telco matter was investigated by a special JusticeDepartment task force set up to examine allegations ofillegal activities by the Baby Bells. Constance Robinson, whoheads the task force, said her unit is investigating othercompanies for decree violations. She declined to elaboratebut said, &quot;We think it is important that consent decrees areenforced.&quot;   The consent decree, which was signed in 1982, bars Nynexand the six other regional Baby Bell telephone companies fromproviding information services, which generally allowcustomers to obtain computer-based information over thetelephone lines. &quot;A court order is the law and companiesbound by a decree are not free to deliberately or recklesslydisregard that decree,&quot; said James F. Rill, head of theAntitrust Division. He called the Bell decree &quot;the mostsignificant antitrust consent decree of recent decades&quot; andsaid the companies &quot;must take all steps necessary to ensurethat they comply with the decree.&quot;   The department said there isn't a maximum penalty underthe criminal statute used in the Nynex case.   The case is to go to trial before Judge Harold Greene, thefederal district court judge who oversees the consent decree.   For Nynex, the indictment was a second major blow fromWashington. Earlier this year, the Federal CommunicationsCommission proposed a record $1.2 million fine against thecompany and rebates to customers for alleged overcharges by aNynex supply subsidiary to the company's two telephone units.Nynex is contesting the proposed fine. The FCC action alreadyhad given some lawmakers pause as they consider legislationthat would free the Baby Bells from consent-decreerestrictions that bar them from providing informationservices, manufacturing telecommunications equipment andentering the long-distance business.   Opponents of freeing the Bells are likely to use theindictment to bolster arguments that the Baby Bells have theincentive and the inclination to break antitrust laws.   The Nynex spokesman emphasized that the indictment and theFCC proceeding aren't related and that the company isconfident lawmakers won't let the charges cloud theirdecisions on the future of telecommunications policy.</TEXT></DOC>
