Barring wet weather orunforeseen problems, they likely will wrap up work on the northbound laneswithin a week, and should finish painting yellow stripes and direction arrowsby mid-October, Murphy added.;   When the last patch of roadway is finished,crews will have laid 5 million square feet of open-grade-mix asphalt. Thatamount -- about 28,000 tons -- could cover 110 football fields one inch deep,said Mike Lawson of Granite Construction, the project's primary contractor.;  Buttoning up job; In addition, during the next two weeks crews will glue29,000 plastic lane markers, known as &quot;buttons,&quot; to the road.;   Work willcontinue this week on the northbound slow lane from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Crewswill close stretches less than a mile long near Bear Creek Road, Idylwild Roadand Laurel curve to finish paving. Delays should be about 20 minutes.;   Therewill be periodic, minor delays through the spring, as well, as crews completea separate job to build on- and off-ramp lanes at the Summit Roadinterchange.;   Since Sept. 3, when work to repave the 13.5-mile stretchbetween Scotts Valley and Los Gatos began, traffic bottlenecks along thewinding mountain freeway have been frequent.;   On four days in particularlast month, accidents that lengthened delays from 15 minutes to two hours hadsome motorists calling the route &quot;The Highway to Hell.&quot;;   One San Jose radiostation even began making light of the horrific jams in its promotional ads,claiming &quot;There's only one thing that lasts longer than Caltrans construction-- classic rock 'n' roll.&quot;;   Employees in Caltrans' Scotts Valley office haveworked late almost every day since the job began, answering hundreds of phonecalls from motorists complaining about tie-ups or asking for updatedconstruction schedules.;   It was worse on the road.;   &quot;It's not too much funwhen people drive by and swear at you,&quot; said one Caltrans worker who asked notto be identified. &quot;Or when they throw cans.&quot;;   But by renegotiating its $1.4million contract with Granite, Caltrans made everyone's life easier, cuttingthe job time nearly in half.;   Originally Caltrans predicted work could lastas long as three months. Planners estimated a completion date in November. Theagency worked a deal with Granite, however, to pay $75,000 for second pavingcrew.;   As a result, crews were able to work in both directionssimultaneously.;   &quot;The weather's been a real godsend,&quot; said Caltransconstruction supervisor Dan Kimberly. &quot;The warm spell was exactly what weneeded.&quot;;   The Highway 17 overhaul is designed to repair structural damagecaused by the Loma Prieta earthquake and years of heavy auto and truck use.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAUL ROGERS, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911001  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  515  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, October 1, 199100275113,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
