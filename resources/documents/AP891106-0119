The Russian-born virtuoso, who brought ``controlled thunder'' tothe piano and was a last link to the 19th century masters, diedSunday at 85 in his Upper East Side home. Funeral services were setfor Friday at the famous La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy.   Horowitz left his native Russia in 1925 and came to the UnitedStates in 1928, playing his first American concert seven days later.   He was an instant success.   ``When he played, he'd turn on the current and it would hit sortof like a shockwave,'' said Morton Gould, president of the AmericanSociety of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ``His performance hadthat unique electricity that was magical.''   ``He touched every musician who ever heard him,'' said pianistMurray Perahia, who was at the home when Horowitz died. ``He knewall the repertory and could play pieces he hadn't done in 20years.''   Horowitz had been in good health and as recently as last weekwas recording in his living room, said his manager, Peter Gelb.Less than three weeks ago, hundreds of admirers filled a recordstore for an album-signing session.   His last performances were in 1987 in Berlin, Hamburg, WestGermany, and Amsterdam, Netherlands, Gelb said. The year before, hehad returned to Moscow for the first time in 61 years for anemotional concert shown on American television.   His final American performances were in the fall of 1986, Gelbsaid, when he played at New York's Lincoln Center and the reopeningof the refurbished Carnegie Hall.   His awards included the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highestcivilian award in 1986, the Legion of Honor from France and Italy'sOrder of Merit. He also was the recipient of more than 20 Grammyawards.   He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Wanda, daughter of thelate conductor, Arturo Toscanini. Visitation was set for Tuesdayafternoon in New York, and then the body would be flown to Italyfor the service at La Scala, a spokeswoman for Gelb said today. Hewill be buried in the Toscanini family plot in Milan, Gelb said.   In a letter of condolence to Mrs. Horowitz, composer-conductorLeonard Bernstein called the temperamental pianist ``a supermusician with all the mortal fallibilities such geniuses have.''   Referring to Horowitz's occasional long withdrawals fromperformance, Bernstein wrote that Mrs. Horowitz cared for him and``returned him to us time and again refreshed, renewed, and evergreater.''   ``The greatest legend of the piano in the 20th century is deadand his death leaves a vacuum which probably can never be filled,''lamented Sir Georg Solti, the Chicago Symphony's music director.   Pianist Emanuel Ax said an audience could feel Horowitz' energywhen he performed.   ``There was the sense of an unbelievable energy being harnessed,and the feeling that if he ever let it go, it would burn up thehall,'' Ax said.   Pianist Andre Watts said, ``It would be hard to come up with anequivalent. There isn't another Horowitz. Thank God forrecordings.''   Watts also said that Horowitz during a performance was ``like ademon barely under control out there on the stage.''   President Carter in 1978 called Horowitz a ``national treasure.''   Horowitz played the White House three times _ first at HerbertHoover's request, second at Carter's, and the third forthen-President Reagan.   Roman Popadiuk, deputy White House press secretary, said in astatement:   ``We are saddened at the loss of this world-renowned musician.We extend our sympathies to his family. His musical legacy willcontinue to live on.''   Horowitz, whose sartorial trademark was a bow tie, was known forhis intense, electric performances, his technique and skill, hisrich interpretations, speed and a power described as ``controlledthunder.''   In addition to his playing, audiences were charmed byeccentricities _ his impish smiles and twinkling eyes. He traveledwith his Steinway grand piano.   He called playing the piano as ``the coordination of mind, heartand finger,'' with emotion the key.   ``The brain is the control of emotion; there has to be somethingto be controlled. The heart is the guide, the brain is the control;what comes out had to have both,'' he once said.   He often interrupted his career for long periods _ 1936 to 1938,from 1953 to 1965, from 1968 to 1974 and from 1983 to 1985.   He continued to make records during the second retirement andserved as mentor to five concert pianists who later would speak ofthe complex relationship that grew between them and their volatileteacher.   The ``demon inside me'' that urged him to do better, and adesire to perform in public again, brought him back to the stagewhen he was 61 with what critics said was a new maturity and awider range.   The pace of his concerts slowed as he grew older, but hisreputation was undiminished.   ``No matter how difficult and complicated the piece, Horowitzwould make it sound easy,'' The New York Times' Harold C. Schonbergonce wrote.   Horowitz was born Vladimir Gorowicz on Oct. 1, 1904, on Kiev'sMusic Street. His father, Simeon, was a prosperous engineerimpoverished by the Russian revolution. His mother, Sophie Bodik,was an amateur pianist who inspired such a love of music in herthree children that daughter Regina also became a concert pianistand son Georg a violin teacher.   Horowitz was given piano lessons at age 6. Within three years,he shocked his parents by learning all the Rachmaninoff pieces inthe family library and all the piano scores of Wagner's operas. Heattended the Kiev Conservatory, where from age 12 to 16 he studiedpiano and composition under Felix Blumenfeld.   He made his concert debut at 19, seeking to earn money for hisfamily.   Horowitz left the Soviet Union on a six-month visa to study inthe West. Instead of studying, he began a two-year European tourthat won him acclaim. It was during that tour, when he played inBerlin, that he changed his name to Horowitz.   In 1933, he was chosen as solo for Toscanini's last in a seriesof Beethoven concerts. Toscanini also introduced Horowitz to hisdaughter, and they were soon married.   Horowitz, who became a U.S. citizen that year, was a longtimecritic of the Soviet system _ ``I don't like the Russian approachto music, to art, to anything'' _ and repeatedly said he wouldnever return.   But he did return in 1986.   The Soviets obviously had not forgotten him; determined fansrushed police and stormed his Moscow concert and open rehearsal. Itwas the most talked-about musical event in the Soviet Union inyears.   Horowitz' only rival for acclaim and popularity was ArturRubinstein, who died in 1982. Rubinstein conceded that Horowitz wasthe better pianist, but not the better musician.   ``I am a 19th-century Romantic,'' Horowitz once said. ``I am thelast.''</TEXT></DOC>
