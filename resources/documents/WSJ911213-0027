Purge empowerment and benchmarking from yourvocabulary. They're all passe, replaced by a fresh batch ofcutting-edge issues -- each with a management label of itsown. This column offers a sample of what you'll hear and reada lot about in the months ahead.   Look for &quot;Randamp;R&quot; to re-emerge as a buzzword, thanks toInternational Business Machines. But this new Randamp;R isn't shortfor executive rest and relaxation. It stands for rating andranking, IBM's controversial new system for evaluating its350,000 employees.   Starting next month, IBM will not only rate its employeeson a scale of one to four (from &quot;superior&quot; contributors tothose &quot;needing some improvement&quot;), but also rank all membersof a group where employees do similar work (so each member ofa group of, say, 60 employees would be ranked from one to60).   The system will give IBM &quot;a better handle at looking atwhat each individual contributes to the overall business,&quot; anIBM spokesman says. But employee-relations specialists andmany IBM employees think the revamped appraisal system isdesigned to help the company in its drive to pare employmentby 20,000 by the end of 1992, in part through increasedfirings. &quot;IBM is pushing much harder to push poor performersout,&quot; says D. Quinn Mills, a Harvard Business Schoolprofessor.   The Randamp;R system isn't exactly new. Bell System companiesonce used it. But the system was deemed counterproductive;managers overseeing many employees couldn't make such finedistinctions about performance. &quot;It's not very progressive atall,&quot; says Ed Gubman, who heads Hewitt Associates'performancemanagement area.   But since IBM is using it, other big employers are likelyto consider the two-step system. &quot;IBM is always a pace setterin human relations,&quot; Prof. Quinn says.                                                                                                          `Theory P' Stresses How   Departments Interact                                                                                                          AS companies stress stream lining the process of making aproduct or providing a service, they are viewing theirorganizational structures from a new perspective.   Such companies as Corning Glass Works, Ford Motor andHewlett-Packard are bypassing the traditional method ofexamining functions -- as symbolized by lines and boxes on anorganizational chart. They're less interested in howindividual departments perform and more interested in howthey work together in the manufacturing process.   What's this called? Theory P (for &quot;people and process&quot;).Booz Allen andamp; Hamilton consultants coined the term.   This approach can pay rich dividends. In a pilot project,Lakeland Regional Medical Center in Lakeland, Fla., cut itsturnaround time for routine tests by more than two-thirds to48 minutes, streamlined its diagnostic radiology proceduresto eight steps from 40 and reduced the number of hospitalpersonnel the average patient encounters to 13 from 27.   There are pitfalls to Theory P, concedes Gary L. Neilson,a BoozAllen vice president. Among them: &quot;Asking tens of teamsto simultaneously redesign all process,&quot; &quot;redesigning whenyou should obliterate&quot; and ending up with crossed signalsbetween employees and managers.                                                                                                          Helping Asians Climb   Through Bamboo Ceiling                                                                                                          THE familiar term &quot;glass ceiling&quot; connotes difficultiesthat women managers have breaking into senior executiveranks. An emerging term, &quot;bamboo ceiling,&quot; applies to Asianand Asian-American employees and their troubles moving intoU.S. management posts.   Though U.S. companies pursue Asians for technical jobs,they often shun them for managerial spots. Many corporateexecutives say Asians often are passive and self-effacing,lacking management skills and possessing cultural values thathurt their ability to succeed as bosses.   The University of Illinois at Chicago has begun a one-yearprogram to give foreign-born engineering Ph.D.s a strong doseof American culture, especially in the ways of Americanmanagers. &quot;Too often, Asians come to believe that if you knowjokes or understand American slang or get pronunciations downpat, you can communicate,&quot; says assistant vice chancellorJudy Curry, who helps lead a seminar on interculturalcommunication. &quot;But there's a need to identify thedifferences in values between Asian and Western cultures.&quot;   Among other things, students learn how to make small talk,ask for a raise, turn someone down gracefully -- and shakehands: &quot;up and down four times, dry, firm, eye contact and asmile,&quot; Dr. Curry says. They also follow the Chicago Bearsand the stock market, giving classmates weekly stock tips.   Next semester, professors in English, history, managementand political science will weave together other aspects ofAsian and U.S. business cultures.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          UP AND COMING: &quot;Age weighted&quot; profit-sharing and pensionplans. Unlike nondiscriminatory corporate plans, theseallocate employer contributions on the basis of age andcompensation levels, favoring owners and other key employeeswho are older than most of the rank and file. . . . &quot;Broadbanding,&quot; or collapsing the number of salary ranges in atraditional salary structure as a company flattens itsorganization, allows greater job-to-job mobility.</TEXT></DOC>
