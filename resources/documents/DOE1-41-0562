Having solved for the average velocities at which electromagneticwave moves from the surface to the bottoms of corresponding micro-layers,the authors can plot the vertical time-distance curve in a coordinatesystem whose coordinate axes are time and depth respectively. The interpretercan then make the interpretation of the vertical time-distance curveto acquire the thickness (or depth) and resistivity of each electriclayer. The examples of all kinds of theoretical curve and real data aregiven in the paper. The inversions of theoretical and field data showthat vertical time-distance methods is an effective method for inversionof magnetotelluric data.</TEXT></DOC>
