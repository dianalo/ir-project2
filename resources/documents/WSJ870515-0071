The banks -- Marlin National Bank, Marlin, Texas, which had assets of $44.3 million; First National Bank of Elbow Lake, Elbow Lake, Minn., which had assets of $17.5 million; United Bank, Libby, Mont., which had assets of $15.8 million, and Todd County State Bank, Long Prairie, Minn., which had assets of $14.3 million -- were closed yesterday by state and federal regulators.    Marlin National, closed by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, is to reopen today as a branch of Bank of Longview, Longview, Texas. The failed bank held $42.5 million in 7,600 deposit accounts.    First National's office, closed by the comptroller's office, is to reopen today as a branch of First National Bank of Fergus Falls, Fergus Falls, Minn. The failed bank held deposits of $16.2 million in 2,750 accounts.    All the deposits and some of the loans of United, closed by state regulators, were purchased by First National Bank in Libby, Libby, Mont. The failed bank's office is to reopen today as a temporary office of First National; state law in Montana bars First National from permanently operating United's office as a branch. United held $14.5 million in 4,900 deposit accounts.    State regulators closed Todd County State's offices. The failed bank's branch office in Grey Eagle, Minn., is to reopen today as a branch of First National Bank, Long Prairie, Minn. The failed bank's main office in Long Prairie won't reopen, and customers will be served at First National's office. Todd County State held deposits of $14.1 million in 4,600 accounts. </TEXT></DOC>
