Grove, president and chief executive officer, said, &quot;Itappears we're catching up with demand for our Intel386 DX and SXmicroprocessors.andP;  As this occurs, we're moving more capacity to our newerIntel486 and Intel386 SL microprocessors, which are stillsupply-constrained.&quot;andM;Grove noted that excellent factory performance allowed Intel to expandoutput, which helped to alleviate the tight supply of Intel386 SX and DXmicroprocessors.andM;The company's bookings set a new quarterly record and its book to bill ratioexceeded 1.0.andP;  Bookings were led by strength in North America and AsiaPacific; bookings in Europe and Japan were off slightly from record Q1levels.andM;Intel said demand for commodity semiconductors and system level products wasstable for the quarter.andM;&quot;In addition to an outstanding financial performance,&quot; Grove noted, &quot;we alsohad an extremely busy quarter in terms of new products and key developments.&quot;andM;Among the highlights: - The company introduced the 50 MHz version of itsIntel486 microprocessor.andP;  Several personal computers and multiprocessorsystems based on this new chip, which is capable of performing 41 millioninstructions per second, have already been introduced by Intel customers.andM;- A second key new product is the i860 XP supercomputing microprocessor, ahigh performance CPU.andP;  It is also expected to be used to bringsupercomputer-like graphics capabilities to technical and businessworkstations as well as personal computers.andM;- The world's fastest supercomputer, the Intel Touchstone Delta system, wasinstalled at Caltech for use by the Concurrent Computing Consortium insolving very large scientific computation problems.andP;  The system is based on528 i860 XR supercomputing microprocessors, predecessor to the XP chipintroduced this quarter.andM;- Digital Equipment Corporation introduced its DECpc 433 Workstation, ahigh-performance, low price desktop system based on the Intel486 DX chip.andO;The new system is built by Intel for Digital Equipment.andM;- Intel began the production ramp for its new 0.8 micron chip production linein Rio Rancho, N.M.andP;  Both the new i860 XP and Intel486 DX 50 MHz chips arebeing produced on this advanced manufacturing process.andM;- In early July, IBM and Apple said their new jointly developed operatingsystem, which should be introduced in the mid-1990s, will run on Intel's X86family of microprocessors, among others.andM;Commenting on the companies' plans, Grove said, &quot;We're pleased to see plansfor a robust, object-oriented operating system that will tap into the fullpower of our microprocessors.&quot;andM;As a result of the record earnings reported today, Intel said its employeeswould receive regular cash bonuses equivalent to 6.8 days' pay as part of thecompany's profit-sharing program.andP;  The bonuses are paid semi-annually and arebased on a pretax income formula.andM;Intel Corp.andM;Consolidated Summary Financial StatementsandM;(In thousands, except per share amounts)andM;INCOME                Three Months Ended         Six Months EndedandM;6/29/91     6/30/90       6/29/91      6/30/90andM;Net revenue       $1,252,686    $968,301    $2,385,464   $1,862,758andM;Cost of sales        590,017     468,989     1,140,418      908,188andM;Research andandM;development         153,957     129,614       299,353      245,594andM;Marketing, generalandM;and administrative  185,826     152,271       353,657      289,013andM;929,800     750,874     1,793,428    1,442,795andM;Operating income     322,886     217,427       592,036      419,963andM;Interest and other    26,917      44,766        56,178       63,998andM;Income before taxes  349,803     262,193       648,214      483,961andM;Income taxes         119,000      91,500       220,000      169,500andM;Net income          $230,803    $170,693    $  428,214   $  314,461andM;Earnings per share  $   1.10    84 cents    $     2.05   $     1.57andM;Common shares andandM;equivalents         209,768     203,774       208,720      200,243andM;BALANCE SHEET                   At 6/29/91        At 6/30/90andM;Current assetsandM;Cash and short-termandM;investments                  $1,918,384        $1,477,732andM;Accounts receivable              781,169           626,751andM;Inventories                      445,764           399,020andM;Prepaid taxes and other          202,291           158,516andM;Total current assets           3,347,608         2,662,019andM;Property, plant andandM;equipment, net                1,870,963         1,410,244andM;Long-term investments            555,795           529,770andM;Other assets                      47,800            34,490andM;Total assets                 $5,822,166        $4,636,523andM;Current liabilitiesandM;Short-term debt               $  145,035        $  188,888andM;Accounts payable andandM;accrued liabilities             758,354           533,628andM;Deferred income on shipmentsandM;to distributors                 133,274           100,105andM;Income taxes payable             176,347           196,120andM;Total current liabilities     1,213,010         1,018,741andM;Long-term debt                   353,310           335,988andM;Deferred taxes on income         144,430           113,843andM;Stockholders' equityandM;Common stock                         203               196andM;Capital in excess ofandM;par value                     1,664,248         1,469,867andM;Retained earnings              2,446,965         1,697,888andM;Total stockholders' equity     4,111,416         3,167,951andM;Total liabilities andandM;stockholders' equity        $5,822,166        $4,636,523</TEXT></DOC>
