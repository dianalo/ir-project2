Attempts to isolate the government of South African PresidentF.W. de Klerk are not the answer, British Ambassador Sir CrispinTickell told the General Assembly's Special Session on Apartheid.   ``Nor are sanctions. ... They certainly weaken the South Africaneconomy, and in doing so they increase misery and poverty, inparticular among the most vulnerable parts of the community,'' itsblack majority, he said.   ``Their political effect is to increase resistance to changerather than to encourage it,'' Tickell said. ``When Mr. de Klerkdoes take the necessary steps, we believe it would then be right tolift some of the measures imposed by the international community,so as to acknowledge progress and encourage South Africa to proceedfurther down the path of dialogue.''   Tickell's advice received polite applause; in the 159-memberGeneral Assembly, the overwhelming majority of nations believeSouth Africa is implementing limited reforms only in response tothe limited sanctions imposed so far.   Most nations favor a total, mandatory trade embargo againstSouth Africa, butthe United States and Britain have used their vetopower in the Security Council to consistently block such moves.   A General Assembly call for all nations to sever economic,military, sports and cultural links with South Africa also has metwith partial success.   Apartheid has established a racially segregated society in whichthe 28 million South African blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
