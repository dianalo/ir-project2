Your article sees only the unrest in my country without appreciating the fact that it is all part of a political transition.    With the Congress of the Philippines elected by an overwhelming majority of the Filipinos, the executive branch of the government being reorganized to respond to the needs of the people, and local elections scheduled for Jan. 18, the country will move toward the direction for nation-building defined by President Aquino: a democratic political order, respect for human rights, national reconciliation, a restored and robust economy, and the elimination of poverty through a more equitable distribution of income and wealth.    People are confident that the government will prevail as shown by the fact that daily life retains its even tenor. While the stock market, as in other financial capitals, has had its ups and downs, it remains active with levels of trading at far greater volumes than last year. Southeast Asian businessmen continue to vie for equity in corporations being sold by the government. It is an exaggeration to say that Manila is &quot;a jittery capital, awaiting the final blow to Corazon Aquino's presidency.&quot;    Other assertions in the article are as exaggerated as they are inaccurate. One is the claim that &quot;checkbook warfare has broken out, with each side bidding for the loyalty of the military commanders whose allegiance is for sale.&quot; Another is that &quot;large elements of the armed forces are hostile to the government.&quot; The truth of the matter is that less than 1% supported the Honasan coup attempt, and the majority of the armed forces are loyal to the constitution and to the president as their commander in chief.    I don't deny that we have serious problems in the Philippines. For instance, the government will have to shoulder a debt-servicing cost of $3 billion more than the assistance it will obtain from foreign sources as a result of the profligacy of the previous regime. But these are the ills of a society that has been ravaged by a corrupt dictatorship and a communist insurgency. President Aquino and the national leadership are determined to cure these ills and to fight insurgency.    In the process of setting our house in order, we need no brickbats but the generous understanding of the American people.
