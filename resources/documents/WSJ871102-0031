But it quickly became apparent that the nomination process for the 41-year-old federal appeals court judge will follow a different path than the battle over Judge Robert Bork, whose nomination was defeated by the Senate 10 days ago on a 58-42 vote.    Mr. Ginsburg has a sparse record outside the fields of antitrust and economic regulation and is an enigma even to some friends and close acquaintances. Some conservatives have welcomed the appointment and praise him as one of their own. &quot;Son of Bork,&quot; conservative columnist Patrick Buchanan called him over the weekend. Some liberals and moderates, however, describe him as a libertarian favorably disposed to privacy, free speech and other individual liberties, in a way that could disappoint President Reagan.    &quot;People tend to see him the way they want him to be,&quot; says an acquaintance of Judge Ginsburg's at the University of Chicago Law School, where he graduated in 1973. One thing they all agree on is that Mr. Ginsburg has first-rate intellectual abilities.    Hal Scott, a classmate in high school and law school in Chicago, and a colleague when Mr. Ginsburg taught at Harvard Law School from 1975 to 1983, says, &quot;My own guess is you're not going to be able to tag him as a libertarian, or anything else. . . . He will try to work his way through particular situations.&quot; On questions of civil rights and liberties and how to interpret the Constitution, Professor Scott says, &quot;He's not a person who discusses these kinds of things.&quot;    One friend, who asked that he not be identified, said Judge Ginsburg has a narrow view of the proper function of the courts. &quot;He makes very modest claims for the role of judges,&quot; the friend said, and believes that the elected branches of government should play a greater role in resolving disputes that aren't at the heart of the intent of the Constitution's framers.    But at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last year on his appointment to the federal appeals court, Mr. Ginsburg offered a relatively temperate definition of &quot;judicial activism,&quot; a practice harshly criticized by conservatives. He said such activism includes judges resolving issues that aren't really presented in specific cases and judges supervising prisons and school systems. He made no mention of the criticism leveled by many conservatives that judges too often substitute their own views for those of Congress or the framers.    Because he is such an unknown, there is little in his record for senators to oppose -- except to raise questions about his youth and level of experience -- unless his confirmation hearings themselves provide ammunition. The hearings will play a major role in the process, as they did with Judge Bork. In visiting members of the judiciary committee Friday, Mr. Ginsburg gave no indication as to whether he would answer questions expansively, as Judge Bork did, or be more circumspect in his replies.    A number of senators who cast pivotal votes in the defeat of Judge Bork urged their colleagues to keep an open mind and to await the hearings. Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.) said there shouldn't be a &quot;rush to judgment.&quot;    An important factor in the hearings will be the rating by the American Bar Association's Committee on the Federal Judiciary. Last year, the 15-member committee gave Mr. Ginsburg its lowest acceptable rating -- &quot;qualified&quot; -- for the appeals court.    For the Supreme Court, however, that category doesn't exist. The choices are &quot;well-qualified,&quot; &quot;not opposed,&quot; and &quot;not-qualified.&quot; The &quot;not opposed&quot; category is reserved for Supreme Court nominees considered minimally qualified, while the other two speak for themselves. Judge Bork received 10 well-qualified votes, one not opposed, and four not-qualified ballots.    Liberal groups that mounted an all-out campaign against Judge Bork were unable to respond quickly to the Ginsburg nomination and have launched their own research efforts. Unless new information is unearthed, some groups that opposed Judge Bork, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, may return to their practice of staying on the sidelines in judicial nominations.    White House officials have suggested that, since Judge Ginsburg is Jewish, Jewish groups that joined the civil-rights coalition against Judge Bork may be muted in the Ginsburg nomination. But questions have been raised in Jewish circles about why Judge Ginsburg's two daughters, one from his first marriage, the other from his current marriage, have been given their mothers' family names.    One family friend said that Judge Ginsburg's first wife was Jewish and wanted her own family name perpetuated. His second wife, Hallee Morgan, an obstetrician, isn't Jewish, the friend said. The naming of their daughter was &quot;more of a feminist thing,&quot; the friend said.    While some lawmakers are hoping to learn more about Mr. Ginsburg, who was formerly chief of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division and an administrator at the Office of Management and Budget, other senators are questioning the selection process in which Judge Ginsburg was chosen.    Four Democratic senators wrote to White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker and Attorney General Edwin Meese to ask them to explain published reports that the White House bowed to conservative threats of a filibuster if President Reagan selected Judge Anthony Kennedy, a federal appeals court judge in Sacramento, Calif.    Judge Kennedy, widely viewed as the likely nominee in the 24 hours before Judge Ginsburg's name was announced, was seen as too moderate by some conservatives, who made their views known to the White House. Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan, Alan Cranston of California, Wendell Ford of Kentucky and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii asked for the explanation.    One question Senate aides will explore is whether Mr. Ginsburg had a conflict of interest when, as head of the Antitrust Division, he helped prepare the Justice Department's brief urging the Supreme Court to extend First Amendment protection to cable television operators. In June 1986, the high court agreed that cable operators are entitled to First Amendment guarantees.    Judge Ginsburg's financial disclosure records show that at the time he held bonds of Rogers Cablesystems Inc., which operates cable systems in the western U.S. His disclosure form, dated July 1985, lists the value of bonds at between $50,000 and $100,000. His form for September 1986 shows the value of bonds of Rogers Communications Inc. at between $100,000 and $250,000. Another form filed with the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 1986 puts the value at $139,000.    Rogers Communications is a subsidiary of Rogers Telecommunications Ltd. of Toronto, Canada.    Terry Eastland, a Justice Department spokesman, said last night on behalf of the nominee that Mr. Ginsburg &quot;considered at the time the possibility of staying out&quot; of the case. He decided to participate, Mr. Eastland said, because he &quot;determined that the value of his holdings in Rogers would not be financially affected regardless of the outcome of the case.&quot; Rogers wasn't directly a party to the case. </TEXT></DOC>
