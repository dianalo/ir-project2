Several results were obtained as follows:the permeability in the rock discontinuity was confined by the characteristicsand inclusion rate of debris, and increasing the degree of inclusionrate of debris reduced the permeability of the rock; in the seepage teston the discontinuity of narrow width with the degree of 0.03-5mm, thelower permeability was observed in comparison with the theoretical valuesfor the hydraulic gradient of 0.01 and under; a permeability of reflecteddiscontinuity was reduced by the bend and elongation of the flow channels.Though the debrises in the rock discontinuity are one of the factors,which confine the permeability, the majority of debrises are to be cohesiveor coagulated and it is concluded that the erosion of debrises is seldomhappened in the extent of the ordinary ground water flow in low speed.(17 figs, 4 tabs, 3 photos, 15 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
