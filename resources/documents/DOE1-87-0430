In this formulation itis possible to interpolate continuously between a regular simpliciallattice and a pseudorandom lattice. Calculating average plaquette expectationvalues we look for the phase transitions of the Z(n)-gauge models withn = 2 and 3. We find all the phase transitions to be of first order,also in the case of the Z(2)-model. The critical couplings increase withthe irregularity of the lattice.</TEXT></DOC>
