The final report won't be released until this summer. Butalready, word of it is causing a stir among fund executivesbecause it predicts a slower growing and less profitablemutual fund industry.</LP><TEXT>   Among the conclusions: In the 1990s, the annual boost infund industry assets coming from new money will amount to3.1% a year, down from nearly 10% in the past 15 years.   The report's author is Heidi Fiske, a New York financialconsultant and former reporter with Institutional Investormagazine. She was hired by the Investment Company Institutein early 1989 to prepare a special report on &quot;The Environmentfor the Investment Company Industry in the 1990s.&quot;   &quot;We conclude . . . that the extraordinary boom which theindustry experienced in the 1980s was in many respects anaberration, created by factors such as the long rise in thestock market and the explosion of money market funds,&quot; Ms.Fiske wrote in a confidential interim report dated Jan. 15.&quot;The industry can look forward to moderate growth . . . butto expect that the growth rates of the 1980s will persistinto the next decade appears unrealistic.&quot;   Until Ms. Fiske's final report is out this summer, theInvestment Company Institute is allowing only a small groupof fund executives to see the report. But Ms. Fiske presentedsome of the report's highlights at last week's ICI generalmembership meeting.   &quot;Virtually all observers expect a margin squeeze in thedecade ahead,&quot; Ms. Fiske wrote. She expects intensifiedcompetition from banks, insurers and foreign firms,particularly the Japanese.   Many fund executives might hope that a slowdown in thenumber of new funds would ease pressure on profit margins.But Ms. Fiske reckons the proliferation of new funds maycontinue, and that the fund industry will also faceintensified competition from other financial products such asbank common trust funds and &quot;wrap&quot; accounts that allowinvestors to hire a personal money manager even though theyhave relatively small amounts to invest.   Fund industry assets jumped tenfold in the 1980s, but Ms.Fiske's report predicts much slower growth over the comingdecade. The report suggests that fund industry assets willgrow from $1 trillion today to $3.5 trillion in the year2000. Money will pour in at a rate of just $58 billion ayear. That means three-quarters of the industry's assetgrowth will come from appreciation of existing assets.   Though money-market funds now account for almost half offund industry assets, Ms. Fiske's report suggests they willshrink to 31% of assets by the end of the decade. Stock andbond funds will account for the remaining 69%, though thereport doesn't spell out exactly how industry assets willdivide up between bonds and stocks.   But Ms. Fiske clearly thinks stock funds could turn out tobe the industry's big winner in the 1990s. She reckonsinvestors, worried about money for retirement and theirchildren's college education, will turn to stocks in searchof higher investment returns.</TEXT></DOC>
