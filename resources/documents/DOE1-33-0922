Epidermal peels taken from top andbottom surfaces after 90 minutes showed an increase in IAA on the lowerside and of Ca{sup 2+} on the upper side. Inhibitors of IAA movement(TIBA, 9-hydroxyfluorene carboxylic acid) block the development of bothIAA and Ca{sup 2+} asymmetries, but substances known to interfere withnormal Ca{sup 2+} transport do not significantly alter either IAA orCa{sup 2+} asymmetries. These substances, however, are active in modifyingboth Ca{sup 2+} uptake and efflux through oat and pea leaf protoplastmembranes. The authors conclude that the {sup 45}Ca{sup 2+} fed to peaepicotyls occurs largely in the cell wall, and that auxin movement isprimary and Ca{sup 2+} movement secondary in gravitropism. They hypothesizethat apoplastic Ca{sup 2+} changes during the graviresponse because itis displaced by H{sup +} secreted through auxin-induced proton release.This proposed mechanism is supported by localized pH experiments, inwhich filter paper soaked in various buffers was applied to one sideof a carborundum-abraded epicotyls. Buffer at pH 3 increased calciumloss from the side to which it is applied, whereas pH 7 buffer decreasesit. Moreover, 10 micromolar IAA and 1 micromolar fusicoccin, which promoteH{sup +} efflux, increase Ca{sup 2+} release from pea epicotyl segments,whereas cycloheximide, which inhibits H{sup +} efflux, has the reverseeffect.</TEXT></DOC>
