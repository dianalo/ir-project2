But officials said it was an &quot;isolated retaliation&quot; that isn't meant to escalate the fighting in Chad.    France and Libya in 1984 agreed on an &quot;interdiction line&quot; along the 16th parallel, which divides the arid African country about in half. The French left the northern half to the Libyans and Chadian rebels but indicated that they wouldn't tolerate Libyan forays into the south. The French, who support Chad's government, in the past have raided northern Chad in reprisal for Libyan actions in the south.    The Libyan air raid in the south came after fresh attacks on Libyan forces in the north by newly reconciled Chadian rebel and government forces. A key group of rebels, led by a former Chadian president, appears to have broken a previous alliance with Libya, Chad's neighbor to the north.    Libya claims parts of northern Chad as Libyan territory. Libya also has sought to play down its latest confrontation with France, saying that its own raid below the 16th parallel was an isolated retaliation, presumably for the new Chadian attacks. </TEXT></DOC>
