No comments on the proposed rule were received. Thus, thisfinal rule is the same as the proposed rule.The benchmark survey is to be conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis,U.S. Department of Commerce, under the International Investment and Tradein Services Survey Act, hereinafter, ``the Act.'' Section 4(b) of the Act,as amended, requires that ``With respect to foreign direct investment inthe United States, the President shall conduct a benchmark survey coveringyear 1980, a benchmark survey covering year 1987, and benchmark surveyscovering every fifth year thereafter * * *. In conducting surveys pursuantto this subsection, the President shall, among other things and to theextent he determines necessary and feasible_(1) Identify the location, nature, and magnitude of, and changes in thetotal investment by any parent in each of its affiliates and the financialtransactions between any parent and each of its affiliates;(2) obtain (A) information on the balance sheet of parents and affiliatesand related financial data, (B) income statements, including the grosssales by primary line of business (with as much product line detail asnecessary and feasible) of parents and affiliates in each country in whichthey have significant operations, and (C) related information regardingtrade, including trade in both goods and services, between a parent andeach of its affiliates and between each parent or affiliate and any otherperson;(3) collect employment data showing both the number of United States andforeign employees of each parent and affiliate and the level of compensation,by country, industry, and skill level;(4) obtain information on tax payments by parents and affiliates by country;and(5) determine, by industry and country, the total dollar amount of researchand development expenditures by each parent and affiliate, payments orother compensation for the transfer of technology between parents and theiraffiliates, and payments or other compensation received by parents or affiliatesfrom the transfer of technology to other persons.''The responsibility for conducting benchmark surveys of foreign direct investmentin the United States has been delegated to the Secretary of Commerce, whohas redelegated it to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).The benchmark surveys are BEA's censuses, intended to cover the universeof foreign direct investment in the United States in value terms. Foreigndirect investment in the United States is defined as the ownership or control,directly or indirectly, by one foreign person of 10 percent or more ofthe voting securities of an incorporated U.S. business enterprise or anequivalent interest in an unincorporated U.S. business enterprise, includinga branch.The purpose of the benchmark survey is to obtain data on the amount, types,and financial and operating characteristics of foreign direct investmentin the United States. The data from the survey are used to measure theeconomic significance of such investment and to analyze its effects onthe U.S. economy. They are also used in formulating, and assessing theimpact of, U.S. policy on foreign direct investment. They provide benchmarksfor deriving current universe estimates of direct investment from sampledata collected in other BEA surveys in nonbenchmark years. In particular,they serve as benchmarks for the quarterly direct investment estimatesincluded in the U.S. international transactions and gross national productaccounts, and for annual estimates of the foreign direct investment positionin the United States and of the operations of the U.S. affiliates of foreigncompanies.The benchmark surveys are also the most comprehensive of BEA's surveysin terms of subject matter in order that they obtain the detailed informationon foreign direct investment needed for policy purposes. As specified inthe Act, policy areas of particular interest include, among other things,trade in both goods and services, employment and employee compensation,taxes, and technology.The survey consists of an Instruction Booklet; a Form BE-12(X), which isto be used to determine the reporting status of those to whom the surveypacket is sent; a Form BE-12(LF), a long form for reporting by nonbankU.S. affiliates with assets, sales, or net income of more than $20 million;and a Form BE-12(SF), a short form for reporting by U.S. affiliates with$20 million or less of assets, sales, or net income, and by U.S. affiliatesthat are banks. Although the survey is intended to cover the universe offoreign direct investment in the United States, in order to minimize thereporting burden, U.S. affiliates are exempt from reporting on Form BE-12(LF)and Form BE-12(SF) if their assets, sales, and net income are $1 millionor less.Primarily to minimize the reporting burden on respondents, BEA made a numberof major changes in the reporting requirements between the 1980 and 1987benchmark surveys. They are:1. Introduction of the BE-12(SF), the short form for reporting by U.S.affiliates with $20 million or less of assets, sales, or net income, andby U.S. affiliates that are banks. In the 1980 benchmark survey, in contrast,smaller nonbank affiliates had to report on the 1980 equivalent of thelong form. Thus, the short form will significantly reduce the reportingburden for these smaller affiliates and for the survey as a whole. Theshort form will also be utilized by banks, whereas there was a separateform for banks in 1980.2. Introduction of the BE-12(X), Determination of Reporting Status. Thisform replaces the exemption claim form used in the 1980 survey. It allowscompanies to determine if they must file the long form or the short formor if they are exempt from filing altogether. This form will be placedfirst in the survey packet and should give reporters a quick, easy wayto determine their reporting status at the outset. This rule revises 15CFR 806.17 to implement the above changes in reporting requirements forthe survey.In addition, this rule amends 15 CFR 806.15 to change the year of coverageof the benchmark survey from 1985 to 1987. The original legislation authorizingthe survey required that a benchmark survey be conducted at least onceevery 5 years. Because a benchmark survey covering 1980 was conducted,the original legislation would have implied that the next survey cover1985. However, amendments to the original legislation made in 1981 (seePub. L. 97-33 and Pub. L. 97-70) now require the conduct of ``a benchmarksurvey covering year 1980, a benchmark survey covering year 1987, and benchmarksurveys covering every fifth year thereafter.'' The postponement of thissurvey from 1985 to 1987 was done in order to place it on the same 5-yearcycle as the Census Bureau's economic censuses. As a consequence, it willbe possible to link the enterprise data reported to BEA in its benchmarksurveys, and the establishment data reported to the Census Bureau in itseconomic census, for those U.S. companies that are in the foreign directinvestment universe.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>BEA has determined that this rule is not ``major'' as defined in E.O. 12291because it is not likely to result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The collection of information requirement in this final rule has been approvedby OMB (OMB No. 0608-0042).<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to preparationof an initial regulatory flexibility analysis are not applicable to thisfinal rule because it will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities. Most small businesses are not foreignowned, and most that are foreign owned are excluded from reporting on FormBE-12(LF) and Form BE-12(SF) by the $1 million exemption level below whichreporting on these forms is not required. Also, under this rule, companieswith assets, sales, or net income above $1 million, but not above $20 million,will report on the much more abbreviated BE-12(SF), rather than on theBE-12(LF). This provision will significantly reduce the burden on smallerbusinesses.Accordingly, the General Counsel, Department of Commerce, has certifiedto the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, underprovisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) that theserules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 806</ITAG>Balance of payments, Economic statistics, Foreign investment in the UnitedStates, Reporting requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 28, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Allan H.
