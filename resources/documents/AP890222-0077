KROPKO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The city's new law banning ownership ofsemiautomatic assault weapons will hurt law-abiding gun owners morethan criminals, gun control opponents complained.   ``Over the next couple of weeks, I think you will find a lot ofspontaneous outrage to it by gun owners and sportsmen,'' saidCharles H. Cunningham, Ohio liaison for the National RifleAssociation. He said Tuesday the NRA's legal branch would soonreview the ordinance.   Several cities passed laws banning semiautomatic weapons after agunman used an assault rifle to kill five children and wound 30other people at a school playground in Stockton, Calif. on Jan. 17.   Wilmette, Ill., became only the fifth municipality in the nationto ban handguns when its village board unanimously adopted such anordinance Tuesday. The ordinance requires handgun owners to turntheir weapons into police for safekeeping. They could reclaim themif they move out of the Chicago suburb.   The Cleveland City Council passed the ordinance 20-0 Friday. CityLaw Director Marilyn Zack signed it into law Tuesday as acting mayorin the absence of Mayor George V. Voinovich, who is vacationing. Shealso signed into law, with the mayor's approval, an ordinanceallowing some police officers to carry 9mm pistols, a more potentweapon than the ones police now carry.   The City Council passed both gun measures after a public hearingin which police made a plea for help in their struggle against drugtraffickers.   At a news conference Tuesday to voice concern about the gun law,William Bash, technical adviser to the Sportsmen and FirearmsCounsel, estimated that more than 75 percent of city gun ownerswould be affected by the change.   Police Commander Robert Bolton said a common gun that would fallunder the new law's restrictions would be a semiautomatic action,center-fire rifle or carbine that accepts a detachable magazine witha capacity or 20 rounds or more.   Other guns banned are semiautomatic shotguns with a magazinecapacity of more than six rounds and semiautomatic handguns that aredesigned to accept a detachable magazine holding more that 20bullets.   Richard Horvath, an attorney for the city, said gun owners willhave until March 3 to take their guns out of Cleveland or make theminoperable.   Under a mandatory sentence provision, a violation is afirst-degree misdemeanor that calls for six months in jail and a$1,000 fine.</TEXT></DOC>
