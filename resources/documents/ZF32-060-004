 In some ways, the conceptdoesn't seem too farfetched.andP;  After all, why shouldn't a brainy machine beable to diagnose and occasionally cure problems without always calling outfor human intervention?andM;Today's personal computers still can't fix themselves completely, but a newclass of utilities software is taking the first step in that direction.andP;  Thissoftware is addressing a corporate need to diagnose and even fix commonhardware ailments too specialized for the capabilities of today's morepopular utilities packages.andM;Over the last two years, Central Point Software Inc.'s PC Tools and SymantecCorp.'s Norton Utilities have garnered the lion's share of attention in theutility tools market.andP;  But this duo is known best for its all-in-oneutilitarian approach, cramming as much functionality as possible into oneprogram.andM;Most of the newer PC diagnostic packages are highly specialized products thatdon't try to be all things to all PCs.andP;  Street prices range from $50 to $150and are typically used by IS staffers to track down and fix many hardwareproblems that would otherwise need the attention of the manufacturer orcomputer dealer.andM;Finding The CureandM;Fueling the growing use of this diagnostic software is the increasedcomplexity of PCs and networks.andP;  &quot;PC computing has indeed become both morecomplex and more critical,&quot; says Andrew Hammond, a Central Point Softwareproduct manager.andP;  In addition, the transition to the graphical user interfaceworld of Microsoft Windows and OS/2 is presenting managers with many newconfiguration and compatibility problems that can be pinpointed withdiagnostic software.andM;The trend is also being shaped by the desire to extend the life of PCs aslong as possible before bringing in new equipment.andP;  &quot;As our PCs get older,they start to fail with increasing regularity,&quot; points out John Pfeifer, PCsupport specialist for US West Communication's finance department in Seattle.andM;Pfeifer recalls the recent failure of seven hard drives, all of which werebrought back to life, data intact, using Gibson Research Corp.'s SpinRite II.andO;The only help once available for failed hard drives was from themanufacturers of the drives or the controllers--options that often resultedin reformatting the drive and data destruction.andM;Gibson Research has made a name for itself as a supplier of diagnosticsoftware that can resurrect some crashed hard disks.andP;  The firm has licensedthis capability to Central Point Software, and according to Gibson Research,Symantec has since discovered the art through reverse engineering.andM;&quot;We are not a stew product with all the functionality, like PC tools orNorton Utilities,&quot; says Gibson Research president Steve Gibson.andP;  &quot;I think wedo a substantially better job focuses on nondestructive, low-level hard diskmaintenance.&quot;andM;US West is using both PC Tools and SpinRite for most diagnostic tasks,although the latter is not yet on the company's approved products list.andO;&quot;When I try to solve a problem, I usually run two products against it andtake a look at the results before I fix it,&quot; say Pfeifer.andM;But most users favor using a variety of utilities separately, knowing thateach one serves a specific task well.andP;  For example, Hughes Aircraft Co.'sMissile Systems group in Tucson Ariz., depends on a number of diagnosticsoftware packages to support its 2,000 PC users.andP;  SpinRite is on Hughes'sfavored list, as is TouchStone Software Corp.'s CheckIt and DiagSoft Inc.'sQAPlus.andM;Doug Crowder, a senior PC LAN consultant at Hughes, confirms the need fordiagnostic software.andP;  &quot;We have people doing a lot of stuff at a variety ofdifferent system levels.andP;  We have to know more about how to make a PC workand program it to work optimally with the GUI andlsqb;Windowsandrsqb; and networkedenvironments,&quot; he says.andP;  Over the long run, Crowder says, Hughes wants toidentify the different hardware setups and anticipate in advance what repairsolutions will work in what environments.andP;  As a result, his support group isbusy talking an inventory of machines to find out how many distinctconfigurations are in the field.andM;Special TraitsandM;A few diagnostic packages are especially adept at detailing a PC'sconfiguration.andP;  CheckIt, for example, reports on processor type, base memory,types of drives present, number of ports available, the contents of thebattery-backed configuration table and the status of attached peripheralssuch as printers.andP;  Beyond issuing status reports and logging user activity,CheckIt can also pinpoint failed random access memory (RAM) chips withoutforcing the user to test every one manually and can report on base, extendedor expanded memory.andM;DiagSoft's QAPlus helps users identify circuitry problems, locate bad chipsand defective ports and detect viruses.andP;  Advanced Diagnostics, from KMSAdvanced Products, performs extensive tests of subsystems such as thekeyboard, display/video controller, interrupt channels and serial/parallelports.andP;  Several diagnostic packages, including CheckIt and QAPlus, alsomeasure PC performance using standard benchmark tests.andM;American Megatrends Inc. sells AMI Diag and AMI Super Tools, even though thefirm's core business is manufacturing motherboards for clone suppliers.andP;  AMIDiag runs a read-only memory (ROM) Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) test,performs low-level formatting and tests hard disk and floppy drives.andM;Preventive MeasuresandM;One unresolved issue facing corporate users is the age-old question ofsoftware site licensing.andP;  Part of the problem is that in most situationsdiagnostic tools are not installed on every computer's hard disk.andP;  Rather,technicians carry the software from PC to PC on floppies.andP;  Some users andanalysts say that, as long as suppliers insist that users pay for one copy ofthe diagnostic software per CPU, its widespread use could ultimately behampered in large companies.andM;But this site-licensing problem may become academic if, as suppliersenvision, their diagnostic software is used more in the future for preventionthan for repair.andP;  That would require the utilities to be installed oneveryone's hard drive anyway, constantly on the lookout for pending failures.andO;The latest version of SpinRite, for example, continuously tests the surfaceof a hard drive and automatically keeps it running, even if it is severelydamaged.andP;  Suppliers of similar packages predict that more end users will relyon their offerings to sense trouble before their PCs actually break down andcry out to human beings for help.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
