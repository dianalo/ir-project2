Members elected Michael Kelliher, an 11-year employee based in Chicago.    The union confirmed Mr. Kelliher's victory, but said final results must be certified by its ballot committee. According to a count by his campaign staff, Mr. Kelliher received 1,447 votes; Ms. Gibbs came in last in a four-candidate field, with 899 of 4,792 votes cast.    In December, American, a unit of AMR Corp., and its Association of Professional Flight Attendants union avoided a threatened strike with an 11th-hour agreement that over time abolishes the airline's two-tier wage scale.    Mr. Kelliher said dissatisfaction with the contract -- and with Ms. Gibbs's tactics -- led to his victory. He also said Ms. Gibbs split the vote of more militant members with her former aide, Elaine Barber, who got 917 votes.    Mr. Kelliher said he opposes the two-tier wage scale, which pays flight attendants hired since 1983 significantly less than senior flight attendants. But he isn't pleased with the new contract, which merges the scales after eight years, saying it &quot;freezes the A scale and lets the B-scale catch up with it.&quot;    Ms. Gibbs wasn't available for comment, and other union officials declined to answer questions until results of the election were certified. </TEXT></DOC>
