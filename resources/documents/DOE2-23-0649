After the very intensive researchof the 1930's and 1940's, which followed the formulation of quantum mechanics,and the path-breaking activity of the 1950's and 1960's, the problemsbeing faced now are much more complex and not always susceptible to simplemodelling. The (subjectively) open problems discussed here are: hightemperature superconductivity, its properties and the possible new mechanismswhich lead to it; the integral and fractional quantum Hall effects; newforms of order in condensed-matter systems; the physics of disorder,especially the problem of spin glasses; the physics of complex anisotropicsystems; the theoretical prediction of stable and metastable states ofmatter; the physics of highly correlated states (heavy fermions); thephysics of artificially made structures, in particular heterostructuresand highly metastable states of matter; the determination of the microscopicstructure of surfaces; and chaos and highly nonlinear phnomena. 82 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
