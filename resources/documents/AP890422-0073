No casualties were reported as the 122mm Soviet-designed Gradrockets exploded around Jounieh, the Christians' only escape routefrom their beleaguered enclave.   Other rockets hit the area around the coastal highway runningnorth to the ancient port of Byblos.   Christian sources reported that one unidentified ship slippedinto the port.   Several other small freighters with unknown cargoes have reachedthe Christian zone in recent days. Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival,has been supplying weapons and ammunition to the Christians.   Saturday's salvos came during a relative lull in the battlesbetween the Syrians, aided by Moslem Druse allies, and the mainlyChristian units of army commander Gen. Michel Aoun.   By police count, 270 people have been killed and nearly 1,000wounded in ferocious artillery and rocket exchanges that beganMarch 8.   Police reported that an estimated 4,000 Christians had gatheredat Jounieh, 12 miles north of Beirut, awaiting a ferry from Cyprusto take them to safety.   The 4,000-ton Baroness M, one of two ferries that have carried12,000 Christians to Cyprus during the fighting, anchored offJounieh on Friday night.   The ship took on an estimated 1,200 people who were shuttled outfrom Jounieh in small boats without incident.   Cypriot shipping officials said the Baroness M would make thetrip to Jounieh again Sunday.   Beirut's Moslem Voice of the Nation termed the Syrian rocketinga ``warning to ships to stay away from the besieged enclave.''   ``It will persist as long as the blockade imposed by Aounperists,'' it said.   The current spasm of fighting was triggered after Aoun, seekingto restore state authority to the fractured government, blockadedillegal ports run by Moslem militias.   The 310-square-mile Christian enclave is ringed on its threelandward sides by hostile forces, and about 1 million Christiansare trapped inside.   Despite the shelling of Jounieh, no major exchanges between theMoslem and Christian regions have been reported for three days. Butfew believed the lull would last.   The Ad-Diyar daily quoted Justice Minister Nabih Berri, leaderof the Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal militia, as warning: ``Thelull will not last ... as long as we don't have a politicalsettlement.''   The television station run by the Lebanese Forces, theChristians' main militia, advised Christians trapped in the enclavehow to aid casualties in the event of new shelling.   ``Keep your nerves under control,'' it said. ``Parks cars insuch a way that they don't block ambulances. Take cover in thenearest bomb shelter, underground bunker or building entrance.''</TEXT></DOC>
