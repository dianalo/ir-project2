It wasspawned within the narrow, and to outsiders mysterious, world ofhackers. What's it like, this esoteric subculture? Occasionalmischief notwithstanding, could it be a national treasure?

Computer hackers.   DEFINE: Misperceived as an electronic subculture of humans whonoodle at computers 40 hours a day _ subsist on Cokes and takeoutChinese food _ typically young, smart males who rarely become noseguards _ often found at schools whose initials end in `T' for Tech _nerds with acne who devise fiendish booby traps to blow the fuses ofthe republic's vital computer systems.   ENTER: Caution. Don't believe everything you read. Hackers aremore likely a national treasure.</TEXT><TEXT>   Seated at a terminal in the computer lab at the University ofCalifornia-Berkeley, Jef (one `f' has been sacrificed for aestheticpurity) Poskanzer, a longhair of 30 years, is poised like VladimirHorowitz about to bring magic from a keyboard.   Plockety-plock-plock. Suddenly on the screen appears a detailedportrait of the Earth's moon. Every 20 minutes throughout the 28-daylunar cycle the portrait changes to update the sunlight'sprogression from fingernail sliver to complete illumination at fullmoon. Jef programmed the computer to do this during several nightswhen the machines usually doze.   Neat.   But why did Jef do this? For about the same reasons thatMichelangelo painted ceiling, Columbus went sailing orHillary-Tenzing worried up the ice of Mount Everest.   ``What use is a newborn baby?'' replied Ben Franklin when arain-soaked fellow onlooker asked him in Paris in 1783 what possiblepurpose Jacques-Alexandre-Cesar Charles could have had in mind inlaunching a huge balloon up into the clouds.   Poskanzer's moon is an intellectual descendant of that balloonand is, in the purest sense of the term, a hack.</TEXT><TEXT>   Hacking can be called an attitude toward problem solving, a humanurge to outwit conventional wisdom, an exploration of limits, notalways absent _ whimsy.   When Caltech students at the 1961 Rose Bowl rearranged the codeof the cheering section's half-time show so their synchronized cardsspelled ``CALTECH'' instead of ``HUSKIES'' for the University ofWashington, then spelled Huskies backward, this was a hack.   Since Robert Morris, a 23-year-old Cornell grad student, wasstrongly suspected of planting a ``virus'' last fall _ actually a``worm'' but don't bother your head about the distinction _ thatgave 6,000 interconnected computers electronic hits, hacking hasbecome a nasty word. Should it be?   According to Steven Levy, the Herodotus of hacking in hisestimable history, ``Hackers,'' the word stems from MIT at the dawnof the computer age in the late '50s. The incubator was the TechModel Railroad Club.   In The Real World, defined by ``The Hacker's Dictionary'' as aplace whose inhabitants wear ties and are thought of as ``not unlikedeceased persons,'' hacking was how Henry VIII solved his maritaldissonances or what inept golfers or unfelicitous writers do.   At MIT, where ingenious students had long since advanced fromreassembling Model A Fords in a professor's room, hacking at theRailroad Club meant creating something of great panache andingenuity without necessarily an ultimate utility. Circuits could berewired not to make the tiny trains run on time, but to make them doit more elegantly.   When computers began showing up on campus, some railroaders wereimmediately drawn to them like moths to a diode. They set behaviorpatterns which abide. They lived by night when computers were idle,neglected families, food, studies, sunlight, soap. The last mayaccount for the scarcity of female hackers.   Early on, hackers, marked more by preoccupation than misogyny,ignored girls because they considered them unprogrammable.Poskanzer, however, backpacks, plays soccer and admits he has a girl.</TEXT><TEXT>   Gifted children have long been prodigies in music and math. Add,now, computers.   ``The young don't know there are walls,'' says Glenn Tenney whois 39, still hacks but knows he must buy foodstuffs in The RealWorld. ``It's easier to spend 40 hours a day hacking when you're akid than when you're middle-aged.''   A hacking prodigy can be called, often unjustly, a nerd.   The source of the term nerd is obscure. In a very informal poll,the only characteristic a majority agreed on was that nerds usuallywear plastic pencil holders in their shirt pockets.   In a lacrosse game, this writer once faced off against an MITdefenseman whose stick was twice the length of mine. Rather thansnarl that he'd split my skull the next time the ref wasn't looking,this student engineer observed:   ``Quite a disparity in leverage, isn't it?''   The remark was probably nerdistic.</TEXT><TEXT>   The hacking instinct in the years B.C. _ before computers _ mighthave expressed itself in the souping of hot rods. But this is dirtywork. Computing is clean. There's a whole world at your fingertips.You don't have to risk rejection when the neighborhood gang choosesup sides for one o' cat.   ``Years ago these kids would have been tipping over decrepitbarns or the like,'' says Don Parker, an authority on computer crimeat SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif., and once an expert inbarn demolition. His childhood mates would almost saw through thesupports of an abandoned barn, tie on ropes, then collapse thestructure before the startled eyes of the owner roused from his bedby the adolescent clamor. Delinquency, perhaps, but with a flairtoward a hack.   ``Most kid hackers are not socially skilled,'' says Dave Flory.``They socialize through the computer.''   ``It's a way to nudge the system, impress your friends, say,`Here I am,''' says Tom Mandel, a hacker who also wears a tie in TheReal World as a futurist at a Silicon Valley think tank.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
