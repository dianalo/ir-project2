In a speech to a meeting of Communist Party leaders this week,Vladilen V. Nikitin, head of the state committee on food, said theSoviet Union has been unable to grow the amount of grain mandatedby the economic plan.   Nikitin also said in remarks published in Friday's edition ofthe Communist Party daily Pravda that the government has beenunable to buy an additional 5 million tons of grain from foreignsources needed to supply the country. That will mean less fodderfor animals, he said.   ``There is no grain because there are no (production) means. ...There are no other reasons,'' Pravda quoted Nikitin as saying.   In some Soviet cities meat is rationed, with people receiving aslittle as the equivalent of two or three good-sized hot dogs permonth.   In remarks published Thursday, Nikitin said Soviet agriculturalproduction represents one-third of the national income but does notreceive adequate equipment.   Government statistics for 1989 published last week showed thatafter an investment of $110 billion in agriculture last year,Soviet food production rose only 1 percent and not the 6.6 percentexpected.   The Soviet government had hoped the program would help it obtainadditional grain more cheaply than by buying it in the West, butauthorities were still forced to import nearly 40 million tons lastyear, 1 million more than in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
