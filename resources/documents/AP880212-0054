(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic presidential hopeful BruceBabbitt's environmental record won him the gold star in a reportcard issued Friday by a national environmental watchdog group.   The League of Conservation Voters praised Babbitt and Republicanpresidential hopeful Pete du Pont for their stands on theenvironment, while criticizing several other candidates, notablyRep. Jack Kemp.   The report gave the former Arizona governor high marks for hisstands on air pollution, acid rain, land management and knowledgeof worldwide problems such as depletion of the ozone layer and rainforests.   Also scoring well among the Democrats were Tennesee Sen. AlbertGore and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, with Missouri Rep. RichardGephardt getting the most lukewarm reception for votes on water andpopulation issues.   Among Republicans, du Pont's record in Congress on waterpollution, toxic waste cleanup and population issues won him theleague's highest score.   League Chairman Brent Blackwelder slammed several Republicans,particularly Kemp and Vice President George Bush, for their recordsand unwillingness to respond to questionnaires about theirenvironmental views.   ``Kemp's record has gotten markedly worse in our last twocharts, and the 50 percent grade we gave Bush is probably betterthan some of his recent statements might suggest,'' Blackweldersaid.</TEXT></DOC>
