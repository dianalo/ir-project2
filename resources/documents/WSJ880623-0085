Big changes are still scheduled to be made next Thursday to the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations system, or Nasdaq. The new rules from the NASD, the self-regulatory body for the OTC market, are meant to fix trading bottlenecks that nearly paralyzed the market in October's crash.    But the NASD, and many investors, have been worrying about a provision that will suspend market makers in Nasdaq National Market System securities for 20 business days if they aren't able to make trades in a given security for more than five minutes. Some of the 2,982 market-system stocks have only a few market makers, and investors in those stocks are nervous about what would happen should all or almost all of the market makers of a given stock be suspended.    In response to such concerns, NASD officials said the 20-day suspension rule won't be in effect when the other changes are made Thursday. Instead, the rule will be implemented starting July 11 to give market makers some time to get used to it.    NASD officials concede that they will still be concerned July 11 that the new penalty strengthens Nasdaq, rather than unnecessarily harming trading in certain stocks.    The NASD is &quot;very aware&quot; of concerns about the 20-day rule, said John T. Wall, NASD executive vice president, member and market services. But Mr. Wall said that if Nasdaq's computers show that the number of market makers in a stock has shrunk greatly, the NASD will try to get other market makers to take over.    If other market makers aren't found, Mr. Wall added, the stock might still continue trading off of the National Market System. About a third of Nasdaq's issues, generally the smallest ones, trade in this way.    John L. Watson III, president of the 7,000-member National Security Traders Association that has worked with the NASD on the changes, said the possibility of losing all the market makers in a given stock is &quot;a concern, but we don't think there's going to be any bad problem.&quot; He said his group will assist in getting new market makers for a stock that loses too many in suspensions.    Although a stock could be hurt by the suspension rule, Mr. Watson said: &quot;We were looking to make the whole system stronger. That's just the price you pay.&quot;    Most officials declined to estimate how many market makers might be suspended under the new rule, but they conceded that there will be at least a handful of suspensions.    The changes specifically are to Nasdaq's Small Order Execution System, or SOES, which automatically executes customer orders at the best price. Most important of the changes is that all National Market System market makers will be required to take part in SOES, whereas in the past only half the market makers took part. Market makers will have to be able to execute five times the size of the biggest orders allowed on SOES, typically 1,000 shares. The 20-day suspension kicks in when market makers can't do that. </TEXT></DOC>
