 It is,however, showing many signs of maturity.andP;  Originally considered asystems-level language, C has found its way into virtually every applicationarea.andP;  C is available on machines ranging from mainframes to home computers.andO;The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) will publish the firstofficial C standard early this year.andP;  Books, toolkits, and add-on productsabound.andP;  And, of special interest here, MS-DOS programmers can choose fromover a dozen C compilers.andM;This article reviews 11 C development environments for MS-DOS, representingmost of those available.andP;  Only MicroWay and Mark Williams declined to beincluded.andP;  Table 1 lists the development systems as reviewed.andP;  Today's MS-DOSprogrammer is blessed with a wide choice of C systems ranging in price from$50 to $600 dollars.andP;  Many include a surprisingly rich set of tools such aseditors, linkers, make facilities, librarians, debuggers, assemblers, andother support utilities.andP;  Because some vendors include full systems in onepackage, while others sell key components separately, this review includesall integral system modules except specialized add-on products such asdatabase toolkits.andM;Four key areas are critical in choosing a C development system: thedevelopment environment, libraries, performance, and compatibility andportability issues.andP;  We emphasized these areas in evaluating the products forthis review.andM;Development environmentsandM;Development environments include the compiler and all support tools such aseditors, debuggers, make facilities, linkers, librarians, and miscellaneousutilities.andP;  C environments fall into two broad categories: fully integratedand stand-alone.andM;In a fully integrated environment, all aspects of the development system areaccessible from an integrated user interface.andP;  You can edit, compiler, linkand debug a program without ever exiting to MS-DOS.andM;Stand-alone environments include separate tools for building programs.andO;However, many modern stand-alone environments approach full integration byincluding editors that invoke compilers and then point out syntax errorsautomatically, and sophisticated make facilities that automate keeping aprogram comprised of many modules up to date.andM;The choice of an environment depends on the needs of individual programmers.andO;Novices need picky, explicit diagnostics; a consistent, simple userinterface; manuals with tutorials and clear examples; a sensible,comprehensive set of defaults; a standard dialect that can be used withtextbooks; and a debugger that interprets expressions interactively.andM;Those on a tight budget need all the pieces--editor, compiler, linker,librarian, and debugger--for one low price.andP;  Size and other resourcerequirements may be an issue.andP;  A compiler that needs 10MB of hard-disk spaceand 640K of RAM won't run on a bare-bones PC compatible or a laptop with3.5-inch disk drives.andM;Professionals working on large projects need sophisticated debugging support.andO;A break-point debugger is essential and a helpful run-time environment isimportant.andP;  Run-time checks for null-pointer references, stack overflow, andillegal heap operations can save hours of work, even with the best debugger.andO;Access to preprocessor output and generated assembly language is alsohelpful.andM;Large projects demand make support.andP;  Rebuilding a program may requirerecompiling and relinking dozens of source modules, each with its ownpeculiar options.andP;  A good make facility can help maintain sanity.andM;Control is crucial for technically demanding projects.andP;  Access to the knobson the back of the set is essential.andP;  An application may require adjustingcode placement, changing segment names, omitting certain types ofoptimization, restructuring or renaming compiler support files, specifyingoverlays, linking with others' object modules, and changing start-up code.andO;Those developing dedicated applications may need run-time source code todevelop special run-time packages that don't rely on an operating system.andM;Documentation for professionals should be well indexed and functionallyorganized and must include the technical depth to make full use of availablecontrols and compiler hooks.andP;  The technical department, not the marketingdepartment, should write the manuals.andP;  Professionals need honest, completeinformation about a compiler's limitations, known bugs, and resourcerequirements.andM;During the early stages of a project, a fast-cycle integrated editor andcompiler can be an important efficiency tool.andP;  Such an environment is idealfor testing and verifying code.andP;  However, many professionals have a heavyinvestment in development tools such as editors and make facilities.andP;  Theability to add a command-line compiler to an existing environment is alsoimportant.andM;Finally, although technically not a part of the environment, an installationprogram that guides a user gently through the myriad files in a C developmentsystem can save frustrating hours of trying to get things to work.andP;  After theinstallation, support is often critical.andM;Table 2 lists installation and support features.andP;  Tables 3 through 6 includeother important features in C development environments.andP;  They cover compileroptions amd editor, debugger, and integrated environment features.andM;LibrariesandM;Libraries are especially important to C.andP;  Library functions do many tasks,such as input and output, which are built into other languages.andP;  If thelibraries are lacking, the quality of the entire development system isquestionable.andP;  Desirable library features include:andM;* A deverse set of useful functions; the number of functions alone does notdetermine a library's qualityandM;* At minimum, functions for file I/O, string and character manipulation,memory management, basic mathematics, type conversions, and low-level accessto the operating systemandM;* Features such as support for terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) utilities,interrupt-service routines, graphics, communications, and 80x87 coprocessorcontrolandM;* Ideally, all ANSI and UNIX functions that apply to MS-DOS environments.andM;Most of the libraries meet minimum expectations, and many offer a rich set ofadditional functions.andP;  Table 7 lists library extras that can be time savers.andM;Functions with the same names as UNIX or ANSI functions should emulate thosefunctions in all respects, or at least implement proper subsets of theANSI/UNIX behaviors.andP;  While most libraries do a good job of including ANSIfunctions, they vary in their support for UNIX-compatible functions.andP;  Table 8shows how the libraries support important UNIX functions.andM;How a manual documents functions is almost as important as which functionsare included.andP;  Important library manual features include:andM;* Alphabetically organized functions: if they are divided into sections, thedivisions should be clear cut and intuitive (no easy task)andM;* A cross-reference that organizes functions by what they do and includescapsule descriptionsandM;* A new page with the function name as part of the page header for eachfunction or related group of functions.andM;Each function description should include a:andM;* Concise description of calling conventions (arguments and possible returnvalues)andM;* Detailed description of what the function doesandM;* &quot;See-also&quot; section, referring to related functionsandM;* Nontrivial example that does something useful and is formatted forreadabilityandM;* Discussion of portability (is the function ANSI- or UNIX-compatible?).andM;Table 9 shows how the manuals complied with these criteria and gives someimportant general features.andM;BenchmarksandM;Although their value is constantly debated, benchmarks are one of the fewempirical tests of a compiler's capability and quality.andP;  The benchmarksselected for this review try to show how the compilers should react to realprogramming tasks.andP;  Table 10 gives the results of five benchmarks for eachcompiler.andP;  They include:andM;Dhrystone:  This classic benchmark contains a mix of instructions thatemulates a typical program.andP;  Our version was translated from the original Adaprogram published by Reinhold P. Weicker (&quot;Dhrystone: A Synthetic SystemsProgramming Benchmark,&quot; Communications of the ACM 27(10), Oct. 1984).andM;FXRef: This MS-DOS filter tests I/O and dynamic-memory-allocation speed.andP;  Itreads text from standard input, breaks the text into tokens, and stores thetokens and their line-number references in a dynamically allocated binarytree.andP;  Finally, FXRef writes the text to standard output, followed by across-referenced listing of tokens and the line numbers in which the occur.andO;This test used the source code for FXRef as input.andM;Grind: This benchmark simulates a common report program to show the speed offile I/O and floating-point calculations.andP;  It reads 5,000 floating-pointnumbers from disk, sorts them, then calculates table values using libraryfunctions.andP;  Finally, it writes the table to disk.andM;Whetstone: This benchmark is commonly associated with FORTRAN.andP;  It tests awide variety of floating-point and integer calculations.andP;  Our version wastranslated from the original ALGOL Whetstone program introduced by H.J.andO;Curnow and B.A.andP;  Wichmann (&quot;A Synthetic Benchmark,&quot; The Computer Journal,Feb. 1976).andM;XLISP: We used XLISP as a benchmark to test how well the compilers did on alarge, complex program.andP;  XLISP is a public-domain LISP interpreter developedby D.M.andP;  Betz.andP;  It consists of 24 source modules and three header files,totaling over 10,000 lines of source code.andP;  To put the compilers on an equalfooting, we used a public-domain make utility with XLISP to test combinedcomple-and-link times.andP;  To test execution speed, we created a specialinitialization file to load a pretty-printer that displayed its own sourcecode.andM;Standards and portabilityandM;Soon ANSI will release the final standard specification for the C language,the result of nearly five years' work by hundreds of poeple.andP;  Why did allthese people volunteer so much time to create this standard?andP;  What does itgive the C programming community?andP;  Where did the standard come from?andP;  Andwhat new features does it offer to C programmers?andM;Language standards give programmers several advantages: programs are portablebetween different environments and easier to maintain because they contain nocompiler-specific code, learning times are lower, and the language has fewerambiguities.andM;Portable programs provide more software to more users.andP;  Moving a program toanother compiler usually means moving it to another machine and, often,another operating system.andP;  Few programs that move across hardware andoperating-system boundaries can be completely portable, but compilers thattreat non-hardware-specific code in the same way make porting programs mucheasier.andM;Language standards make code easier to maintain.andP;  When programmers movebetween environments, they don't have to spend time learning a specificcompiler, just the language itself.andP;  A programmer faced with the task ofmaintaining another's code written with a different development system canrely on a consistent language implementation.andM;Standard languages allow programmers to use the same tools and utilities indifferent environments.andP;  Tools written in the target language are portableapplications.andP;  Finally, a standard for a maturing language such as C clearsup ambiguities in the language that have developed in the first few years ofits existence.andM;The first problem in adopting a standard is choosing which standard to adopt.andO;Historically, C compilers have used the de facto Kandamp;R standard.andP;  Although longa mainstay, the Kandamp;R standard proved insufficient to deal with C's manysubtleties or to meet the needs of a maturing laguage.andP;  As C matured, vendorsadded features lacking in the original language.andP;  Fortunately, vendorsrealized that as each vendor changed the language, the resulting compilerswould implement different derivatives of C, but not C.andP;  The push to developANSI C arose from this confusion over C's future.andM;Written about extensively in this journal and others, ANSI C is a solidspecification that should meet the future needs of programmers.andP;  Major newfeatures include standard header files and libraries, function prototypes,several new data modifiers, and many small but important details.andP;  ThomasPlum, a teacher of C, consultant, and vice chair of the ANSIC committee, hasidentified 101 crucial areas for ANSI compatibility.andM;Testing all 101 critical ANSI-compatibility areas is costly because many testthe language implementation as a whole.andP;  But 79 of the standard's specificrequirements can be tested with a test program that runs by itself.andP;  Althoughit may be premature, with Plum's help we tested the compilers in this reviewto find out how far they have to go to be ANSI-compatible.andP;  And perhaps it isnot overly premature, because many vendors already advertise ANSIcompatibility.andP;  Table 11 lists the test results.andP;  (With Plum's permission,the complete test suite for the 79 tests in the ANSI sampler is availablefrom the COMPUTER LANGUAGE Bulletin Board Service and CompuServe forum.)andM;Will ANSI C deliver the promise of program portability?andP;  Nothing is perfect,and ANSI C will be no exception.andP;  Standard header files, libraries, and othermajor features will go a long way toward eliminating problems in portingprograms.andP;  However, truly portable programs will require that programmersfollow many additional rules.andP;  A discussion of all the rules is beyond thescope of this article, but some of the more important ones are:andM;* Do not use hard-coded path names.andM;* Do not make assumptions about the size of data types, particularly integertypes, or the storage alignment of data: sizeof() can help deal with theseissues.andM;* Some compilers may not support bit fields.andP;  If used, bit fields shouldnever exceed 16 bits.andM;* Casts of pointers to pointers of different types may cause problems.andM;Will ANSI C cause problems for programmers?andP;  Different programmers willdislike different minor details.andP;  But programmers will gain more than they'lllose with ANSI C.andM;Aztec CandM;Programmers with a UNIX background should love Manx Software's Aztec C.andP;  Theeditor is a clone of vi, the debugger is UNIX's sdb, and Aztec C includesseveral UNIX filters.andP;  Even the supplied make facility appears to be fullyUNIX compatible.andM;The similarities extend to the documentation, with UNIX-style manual pagesfor each command and UNIX-style partitioning.andP;  Functions are wellcross-referenced and, when necessary, include reasonable examples.andP;  However,the documentation has one drawback--poor organization.andP;  DOS- and8086-specific functions are in a completely different section than otherfunctions, some other topics are split into different locations, and the twoaddenda barely fit in the binder.andM;Aztec C has a sparse library, but the functions are well implemented.andP;  Manxcarefully preserves UNIX and ANSI compatibility.andP;  Of special note is a goodimplementation of the UNIX ioct() function, which controls the behavior oflow-level I/O devices such as the console.andP;  Manx supplies the source code forthe complete library with the commercial version of the compiler.andM;Manx should also be commended for including a run-time profiling utility.andP;  Aprofiler reports where a program spends its time and is invaluable foroptimizing large programs for speed.andP;  A UNIX-compatible monitor() functionenables the profiler.andM;Aztec C is known for its ability to make programs for ROM.andP;  It includescomplete support for generating the Intel hexadecimal-format files expectedby most programmable ROM (PROM) burners.andP;  It includes an .EXE to .HEXconversion utility and special, ROMable start-up routines.andM;Considering the need for small code size in ROM applications, it is notsurprising that Aztec C made by far the smallest programs in the benchmarktests.andP;  Compilation times were faster than average, although execution timeswere slightly slower than the norm.andM;The XLISP test caused the only significant problem because the documentationon increasing stack size is inaccurate.andP;  The manual explains how to set threevariables, but it doesn't mention that a fourth variable, _STRKRED, must beset to at least 1,024.andM;Aztec C tied with High C in passing 48 of 79 ANSI tests.andP;  The Aztec compilerdoesn't support the new backslash control characters, \x, \v, and \a.andP;  Mostother tests it fared poorly on were UNIX-related.andM;Anyone doing development for multiple environments should consider Aztec C.andO;Manx offers compilers for many architectures including CP/M.andM;C86PLUSandM;C86PLUS from Computer Innovations is one of only two systems that do notfurnish an editor.andP;  Although it also omits a debugger, the compiler output isobject-code-compatible with Microsoft C.andM;Compiler switches needed for Microsoft's CodeView debugger are indentical toMicrosoft compiler switches.andP;  The manual advises using CodeView and givesspecial instructions for preparing CodeView-compatible output.andP;  The makefacility is complete except that internal rules can't be redefined and macroscannot be targets.andM;The manual is professional, to the point, and a joy to read.andP;  It is full ofuseful hints, but not for programmers who are unfamiliar with environmentvariables and dynamic memory allocation.andP;  C86PLUS includes source code forkey parts of the run-time package and detailed instructions for changing thecode to create a dedicated run-time environment.andM;However, the library reference has several problems.andP;  The general librarycross-reference is inadequate.andP;  It includes a list of functions grouped bytype, but without a capsule description of what the functions do.andP;  Functionexamples use array indexes instead of pointers and do not indent the bodiesof loops and if statements.andP;  Some hard-to-understand functions such assignal() and the ANSI time functions have no examples at all.andM;C86PLUS has a very good basic library with good ANSI support but few extras.andO;For example, it does not support graphics, although it does offer good serialand parallel communications support.andP;  The signal() implementation stands out.andO;It supports trapping read and write errors, a memory-allocation error, andmost importantly, a bad free() pointer.andP;  However, Computer Innovations couldimprove UNIX support.andP;  For example, C86PLUS has a _doprnt() function but noandless;varargs.bandgt;.andM;On the benchmarks, C86PLUS was the slowest compiler for compile-and-linktime--nearly twice as slow as its nearest competitor, WATCOM C.andP;  It madelarger-than-average programs that were acceptably fast, except when thefloating-point emulator was involved.andP;  The emulator portions of the Whetstoneand Grind benchmarks yielded exceptionally poor showings.andP;  C86PLUS could nothandle the XLISP benchmark because of a problem in its expansion of complexmacros containing the? operator.andM;C86PLUS passed a respectable 54 tests in the ANSI sampler.andP;  It was the onlycompiler to pass the phases-of-translation test.andP;  The compiler ranks wellabove average for ANSI conformance.andM;Don't plan to run this compiler from 360K floppies.andP;  The main executable fileis 588,944 bytes and the package uses about 2MB of disk space.andM;DeSmet DC88andM;C-Ware's DeSmet DC88 uses a modular approach.andP;  the basic system includes anonoptimizing compiler and small-model support.andP;  C-Ware sells large-modelsupport and an optimizer separately.andM;The DeSmet editor, See, supports two split-screen windows and uses aspreadsheet-style menu.andP;  The editor can invoke the compiler, retrieve errors,and position the cursor at the trouble spots.andM;The stand-alone debugger is a primitive, command-driven, symbolic debugger.andO;It uses most of the screen as a TTY-style display, reserving the top fewlines for status information and a spreadsheet-style menu.andP;  Program outputgoes to an alternative display that can be accessed with a flip command.andO;(This doesn't require a separate monitor.)andP;  The result is much like usingsdb, the UNIX debugger.andM;DC88 includes several useful tools including grep, a separate assembler, anda cross-referencing source-code lister.andP;  It was one of only two systems toinclude a profiler for determining where a program spends its time.andP;  Althoughthe basic package doesn't include a compiler driver, one comes with theoptimizer.andP;  A utility that writes batch files from simple dependencyspecifications offers only limited support for project maintenance and doesnot compensate for the omission of a full make facility.andM;The manual includes a set of update pages that is about one third the size ofthe original manual.andP;  This much updated material should justify a new manual.andO;However, all the page shuffling yields a complete, well-organized manualexcept for one major omission--an index.andP;  C-Ware is the only vendor thatsupplied manual supplements designed for integration into the originalmanual.andM;Unfortunately, the library does not meet the standards set by thedocumentation.andP;  The library uses ANSI/UNIX names for nonstandard functions.andO;For example, exec() has completely different argument-passing conventionsthat the UNIX version.andP;  The system interface is nonstandard, the printf()implementation is minimal (no %p), stat() is absent, and the library has nosupport for wild-card file searches except resorting to the DOS interruptfunctions.andM;The library does come with a good set of graphics and screen I/O functions,although all the documentation is on disk.andP;  The graphics functions supportthe CGA and Hercules adapters only.andP;  EGA support would be a plus.andM;In the benchmark tests, DC88 was the second-fastest compiler tested and madethe third-smallest programs.andP;  However, it fell short in executable times,coming in well above average.andP;  DC88 could not compile the XLISP benchmarkbecause of a limitation of 500 external and static declarations per sourcemodule.andP;  XLISP's XLFTAB.C module exceeds this limit.andM;DC88's ANSI preprocessor will break some Kandamp;R-compatible code because of theway it expands complex macros.andP;  However, this fault lies with ANSI, not withC-Ware's compliance.andP;  DC88 passed only 36 of 79 ANSI-compatibility tests.andP;  Itwas the only compiler that did not support all unsigned types.andP;  For ANSIconformance, this compiler is below average.andM;Eco-C88andM;Ecosoft's Eco-C88 includes a WordStar-like editor with special features forinvoking the compiler and reporting errors, a multipass compiler capable oflint-like semantic diagnostics, and a stand-alone debugger.andP;  The lint-likediagnostics can be especially helpful.andM;Each of the parts is small (30K to 90K), making Eco-C88 a practical choicefor floppy-based systems.andP;  Eco-C88 uses so little RAM that a 640K systems hasabout 200K free for a RAM disk.andP;  (The manual includes advice about using sucha RAM disk to improve performance and convenience.)andM;The editor's on-line help system includes interface information for alllibrary routines.andP;  Much like the Brief editor, Eco-C88's editor displayscompiler error messages in a screen window after positioning the editor atthe appropriate line in the source file.andP;  Compiler error messages citerelevant pages in Jack Purdum's popular C Programming Guide.andP;  (Purdum ispresident of Ecosoft.)andM;Although Eco-C88 doesn't include a make facility, a driver option does amini-make, rebuilding only source files that have changed since theircorresponding object files were changed.andP;  Ecosoft supplies the completesource for the driver.andM;The debugger has one outstanding feature: a single command sets a breakpointat the start of every function.andP;  Otherwise it is roughly comparable to thestripped-down, integrated debuggers in QuickC, Turbo C, and Express C.andM;Most of the manual covers the standard library.andP;  It does not include alanguage specification.andP;  The manual confines the bulk of advanced technicalinformation to nine pages covering segment naming, memory layout, and callingconventions.andP;  The balance of the manual covers the various user interfacesand furnishes novice-level help with MS-DOS configuration and theprogram-development cycle.andM;The library reference suffers from a lack of cross-referencing and no headerson the manual pages, making it hard to find specific functions.andP;  The manualdoes not state if a function is ANSI- or UNIX-compatible or unique toEco-C88.andM;The library is adequate but limited.andP;  It includes a minimum of the functionsneeded to write useful programs.andP;  The library has some unusual features.andP;  Forexample, it contains a UNIX-compatible qsort() and bubble, quick, and shellsorts.andP;  However, the latter are incompatible with qsort(), so they can't beused interchangeably.andP;  Because the bubble sort is extremely slow, a heap sortwould be more useful.andM;However, the library includes several useful and interesting groups offunctions for directory-walking, maintaining binary trees, and building hashtables.andP;  A soundex() function, which tests two strings for phoneticequivalence, is useful for &quot;do-what-I-mean&quot; command interfaces.andM;A set of memory-file functions support copying a file to active RAM memory,then accessing the file from memory instead of the disk.andP;  These could beuseful to improve file-access times, but carry the same dangers as RAM disks.andM;Unfortunately, the library has compatibility problems.andP;  A child() call spawnsa child process, but the arguments for child() are dissimilar to the morestandard exec().andP;  A set of spawn() functions is missing.andP;  The ioctl() is notUNIX-compatible and a UNIX-compatible stat() function for portable directoryaccess is missing.andM;Finally, screen I/O support is primitive--the library provides access to thenormal DOS and basic-input-output-system (BIOS) functions, but little else.andO;It does not include direct video or graphics functions, and the functions itdoes contain require ANSI.SYS.andP;  Nor does it support signals.andP;  AlthoughEco-C88 is a low-cost product, its maturity makes these deficienciesdifficult to explain.andM;The benchamarks show that Eco-C88 is an average compiler in compilation speedand file size.andP;  However, Eco-C88's execution times were consistently andsignificantly slower than average, especially for the benchmarks thatinvolved floating-point calculations.andM;Eco-C88 passed only 26 of 79 ANSI tests, finishing next to last.andP;  Its majorfailings include not supporting constants or the volatile keyword and nothandling ellipses.andP;  Eco-C88 ranks well below average in ANSI compatibility.andM;High CandM;MetaWare's High C includes a compiler, a handful of UNIX-style filters,several configuration utilities, and utilities for manipulating Lattice,Microsoft, and Digital Research object modules and libraries.andP;  It does notinclude an editor or even a compiler driver for automatically invoking alinker (also not included).andM;By default the compiler generates listings with nesting levels at the leftthat function like a curly brace checker.andP;  Loadable tables drive parsers andscanners, making the compiler highly configurable by MetaWare; however, thisfeature is undocumented.andM;MetaWare offers compatible compilers and cross-compilers for severalnon-Intel architectures and is one of three compilers that supports OS/2.andO;OS/2 support is an extra-cost option.andM;If C gives you enough rope to hang yourself, High C gives you enough to bindand gag everyone in the neighborhood, rig the sails on a small ship, and hangyourself from a yardarm.andP;  Pragmas specify aliases, design customfunction-calling conventions, rearrange code and data, mix models andlanguages, include other pragmas, change strategies for searching for includefiles, control the format of source and assembly listings, force severalbehaviors that improve backward compatibility, enable and diable lint-likewarnings, change internal naming conventions (let's put two underscores atthe end instead of one at the beginning), choose C++ style unions, and cleanthe kitchen sink.andP;  This results in incredible flexibility, but may beslightly confusing to those who are new to C.andM;To supplement the tiny set of pragmas, MetaWare includes several languageextensions, including block and function nesting similar to Pascalhs.andP;  As ifall these options weren't enough after a long day, they're all explained insome of the most demanding technical terms available in any compiler manual.andO;The manual explains most features in terms of their low-levelimplementations.andP;  This manual is practically written in assembly language--itis definitely not for beginners.andM;However, for those who can absorb it, the manual offers much usefulinformation about some very esoteric applications.andP;  It includes a goodoutline of the necessary steps to make ROMable code (including buying aseparate locate utility to fix up addresses), and discusses a bewilderingarray of mixed-model and mixed-language configurations.andP;  The manual gets goodmarks for its library reference, especially the &quot;see-also&quot; sections, whichnot only list related functions with their page numbers, but also givecapsule descriptions.andM;The High C library is something of an anomaly.andP;  It has excellent ANSIconformance, but the attitude seems to be that if a function isn't in thedraft standard, it isn't needed.andP;  The library has no low-level I/Osupport--open(), close(), read(), write(), stat(), and others are missing.andO;The only way to spawn a child process is via system().andP;  And the libraryprovides no mechanism for accessing DOS or BIOS, making it difficult toovercome other deficiencies without resorting to assembly language.andP;  Manyprograms are difficult to port to this compiler because of the lack of thesenon-ANSI functions.andP;  However, programs written for High C should be easy toport to other environments.andM;Only C86PLUS and WATCOM C were slower at compiling than High C.andP;  High C madelarge programs with slower-than-average execution speeds.andP;  It could notcompile the XLISP benchmark, continually crashing with multiple system errorsand internal stack dumps.andP;  MetaWare could not furnish a solution to theproblem in time for this review.andM;High C tied with Aztec C in passing 48 of 79 ANSI tests.andP;  It ranks slightlyabove average in ANSI conformance.andM;Lattice CandM;Lattice C has been a mainstay for MS-DOS programmers.andP;  Although they havelong since parted ways, in the early days Lattice C and Mitcrosoft C waresynonyms for the same product.andP;  Working with Latice is much like ending atrip through the Texas panhandle: you realize you have reached thedestination, but have few lasting impressions of the journey--no realsurprises or disappointments.andM;However, Lattice C has several positive features.andP;  It is one of threecompilers reviewed that supports both OS/2 and MS-DOS development work.andP;  Itincludes an editor, a stand-alone debugger, and a special linker for OS/2.andO;The installation program was one of the best.andP;  And the MS-DOS version willrun from 360K floppy disks.andP;  Although Latice C omits a make facility, adriver option supplies a mini-make, compiling only source files that arenewer than their corresponding object files.andM;The editor supports to split-screen windows and uses a spread-sheet-stylemenu at the bottom of the screen.andP;  It can invoke the compiler, retrievecompilation errors, and position the cursor at suspect lines.andP;  The keyboardis fully configuarable.andP;  However, the editor lacks some key features such ascommand macros and goto tags.andM;The debugger is a command-oriented, symbolic-breakpoint debugger thatincludes a sophisticated macro capability and a knowledge of C source code.andO;While capable, it is less convenient that a windowing debugger such asCodeView.andM;The manuals are professional and to the point.andP;  They are designed primarilyas a reference for experienced programmers.andP;  The manuals organize functionsby library--standard, math, real-mode, old, and graphics--but a &quot;CombinedLibrary Index&quot; makes finding functions in different sections less painful.andO;Strangely, although Lattice includes an OS/2 protected-mode library, it wasnot documented in the manuals or on the disks.andP;  We assume this oversight willbe corrected.andM;The libraries are of high quality and loaded with functions.andP;  They conform toANSI and support UNIX well.andP;  The graphics library is worth special mention.andO;It includes functions to save and restore pictures to and from files and goodsupport for windowing environments.andM;Lattice C required changes to several benchmarks.andP;  Both FXRef and Grindcontained function prototypes with dummy variable names that had to beremoved; that is, Lattice considers void func1(short x); an illegal prototypeand void func1(short x)[]; an illegal definition.andM;Lattice C also required the const type qualifier after the data type inWhetstone (int const instead of const int).andP;  With XLISP, the compilerrequired the \n option for long symbolic namesandM;Lattice C compiled slowly, and the programs it built were generally slow,especially so for XLISP.andP;  However, it made surprisingly small programs for anonoptimizing compiler.andM;In the ANSI conformance tests, Lattice C finished dead last, passing only 20of 79.andP;  However, this could be because of a conscious decision on Lattice'spart not to seek conformance until the standard is official.andM;For the technically oriented, Lattice C puts const items in a separatesegment even with the small model and lacks good segment control.andP;  However,it includes an interesting C extension that allows applying the * operator toan array name.andP;  Although it's slow, the \R compiler option also meritsmention.andP;  It authomatically inserts object modules into a library.andM;Microsoft C with QuickCandM;Microsoft C feels more like an institution than a mere piece of software.andO;Everywhere in the manuals and the products you can see the results ofcumulative decades of use.andP;  Microsoft C is one of the most completedevelopment systems we reviewed.andP;  It includes all the essentials: driver,linker, make, librarian, debugger, editor, a host of minor utilities, and afully integrated environment in the form of QuickC.andP;  This release alsoincludes both MS-DOS and OS/2 support.andP;  All these features make a hard disk anecessity.andM;The editor, ME, can edit multiple files, run the compiler, and retrieveerrors.andP;  The keyboard can be completely reconfigured.andP;  This editor is uniquein supporting C extensions, essentially executable C modules containingeditor hooks for customizing the editor.andM;The stand-alone debugger, CodeView, can trace more than a single thread ofexecution, trace through overlays, and examine interrupt handlers.andP;  CodeViewcan use Expanded-Memory-Standard (EMS) memory to store symbolic information,but doesn't include a macro facility.andP;  A new graphic display command followspointers much like the Turbo C debugger's inspect.andM;Microsofths documentation (even for QuickC) informs instead of teaching.andP;  allthe information is present, but sometimes you must work hard to find it.andP;  Thev. 5.5 manuals are generally good.andP;  Unfortunately, Microsoft didn't handlethe manual updates to v. 5.1 well.andP;  The documentation comes in three pieces:printed 5.0 manuals, printed update sections, and more than 100 pages in adisorganized collection of readme files.andP;  Although the library reference isgenerally very good, the examples need work.andP;  Most are poorly formatted, andmany are trivial to the point of being noninformative.andM;The libraries are extensive and of high quality with excellent ANSI and UNIXcompatibility.andP;  They include a full graphics library.andP;  Microsoft C alsooffers the greatest number of floating-point options, including analternative math library for noncoprocessor applications that is faster thanthe emulator but less accurate.andM;QuickC, which is also available separately, competes directly with Turbo C infeatures and performance.andP;  It includes a fast compiler (with a restricted setof compile and link options), a WordStar-like editor, and a stripped-downdebugger.andP;  Unlike Turbo C, quickC has mouse support.andP;  Unfortunately,single-stepping the debugger requires an awkward two strokes per step.andM;The QuickC integrated debugger's smart pointer option traps some types ofpointer errors.andP;  However, the smart pointers weren't smart enough to trap thetwo simple bugs we tested.andP;  Both an overwrite of stack space and a free() onan auto variable went undetected (as they did in Turbo C).andM;QuickC includes a simple project facility similar to Turbo C's.andP;  Unlike TurboC, however, QuickC can convert this project information into a make file.andO;The competent, stand-alone, make facility is similar to but incompatible withUNIX make.andM;Compared with the other stand-alone compilers, Microsoft C compiled withaverage speed.andP;  The programs it make were slightly smaller than average.andO;While, with one exception, it did not make the fastest programs, those itmade were consistently fast and never more than a few percentage pointsslower than competitors' results.andM;QuickC compiled and linked very fast, ranking third behind Turbo C and DeSmetDC88.andP;  Compared with Microsoft C 5.1, QuickC's executable files were slightlylarger and slower.andP;  The only exception was the FXRef benchmark, where QuickCfinished slightly faster than C 5.1.andM;Microsoft C 5.1 had respectable results for the ANSI tests, passing 54 of 79.andO;It showed no glaring weaknesses in ANSI conformance compared with the othercompilers.andP;  QuickC came in just below Microsoft C 5.1.andP;  The results wereidentical except that QuickC failed the &quot;catenation, stringizing&quot; test.andM;For the technically oriented, we noticed that if you are working in the rootdirectory and the function _searchenv finds a sought-after file there, thepath it builds has an extra backslash (A:\\test.txt).andP;  And many prototypesare issing const keywords in the include files.andM;Finally, two optimization switches dealing with aliases can create bad objectcode for legal statements.andP;  An alias occurs when a memory location can beaccessed via different variables, usually pointer references.andP;  /Oa and /Oxrelax alias checking.andP;  With either, Microsoft C assumes that it can delete orchange variables without determining whether they are changed under anothername.andP;  This is not a bug; the manual clearly states that you can only ignorealiasing if the program is written properly.andP;  However, it can causefrustraction if you aren't careful.andM;Power CandM;It seems the people at MIX Software realized they couldn't give Power C andits siblings away and stay in business, but decided to see how close theycould come.andP;  A compiler, editor, unsophisticated make facility, stand-alonedebugger, assembler, librarian, binary-coded-decimal (BCD) library, and fulllibrary source code are available for under $70.andP;  Add another $19.95 for adatabase toolkit (not reviewed).andP;  This adds up to a lot of gear at a veryreasonable price for budget-minded programmers.andP;  However, the way twocomponents are packaged was a surprise--the librarian and assembler come withthe source code, not the compiler.andM;The editor supports editing two files in a split-screen environment.andP;  It canrun the compiler and retrieve error messages.andP;  It is the only stand-aloneeditor we reviewed that can call the debugger after a compilation.andP;  Thiscomes very close to putting Power C in the fully integrated environmentcategory.andM;The debugger, Power Trace, uses a four-quadrant screen with aspreadsheet-style menu.andP;  Power Trace puts on an interesting show,highlighting each subexpression individually as it is evaluated.andP;  In afunction call, each of the parameters and then the function name ishighlighted, furnishing a good graphic introduction to evaluation order.andM;Power Trace has a unique, execution-logging facility.andP;  It remembers the last255 statements executed.andP;  Instead of writing a series of line numbers to afile, Power Trace shows the history graphically by highlighting each step inreverse order.andP;  It can show a program running in reverse.andM;Unlike other debuggers, Power Trace always displays all variables currentlyin scope in a scrollable display window.andP;  This is convenient for small datastructures, but not for large linked lists.andM;The Power C manual targets beginners, trying to teach C fundamentals; it alsofunctions as a reference for the package.andP;  The library reference loses pointsfor omitting an overview of how to use the various functions together andcompletely omitting function cross-references in the individual functiondescriptions.andP;  However, the rest of the reference is good.andP;  The manuals forall the modules include installation instructions for floppy-based systems.andM;The libraries were a surprise in two ways.andP;  They were complete, containing afull complement of utility functions, good ANSI and UNIX compatibility, DOSsupport, adequate graphics, and good TSR support.andP;  They also lacked supportfor all but the medium memory model.andP;  Mix was the only vendor to offer a BCDlibrary for business applications.andP;  BCD calculations make sure a programdoesn't lose any pennies and irritate CPAs.andM;Power C could not compile XLISP because it lacks a large memory model (sonoted in the readme file).andP;  Because a small model is also missing, allbenchmarks used the default, medium model.andM;The compilation and linkage times were a little slower than we expected of acompiler advertised as competing with Turbo C and QuickC.andP;  Execution speedswere better than average, but program sizes were larger than average.andM;Power C displayed above average ANSI compatibility.andP;  The compiler passed 54of 79 tests, tying Microsoft C and C86PLUS.andP;  Power C showed no majorweaknesses on its march toward ANSI conformance.andM;Turbo C ProfessionalandM;Borland International's Turbo C Professional Package includes Turbo C, TurboDebugger, and Turbo Assembler (not reviewed).andP;  Borland also sells Turbo Cseparately for $150.andP;  While it requires three 360K disks, you can run Turbo Con a floppy-based system.andP;  The installation program includes this option.andM;Turbo C's user interface is well designed.andP;  It is intuitive, consistentacross all subsystems, very fast, and requires minimal typing skills.andP;  Theintegrated environment includes a WordStar-like editor, directory access,full control over compiler and linker options, and access to a simple projectsupervision facility (a mini-make).andP;  You can also run the linker and compilerwith a traditional, command-line driver.andM;Like QuickC, the Turbo C integrated debuggerhs smart pointer option trapssome types of pointer errors.andP;  Like QuickC, the smart pointers didn't trap anoverwrite of stack space or a free() on a auto variable.andM;The stand-alone debugger offers a full range of monitoring and executionfacilities through a slick, windowing environment.andP;  The inspect commandfollows pointers, greatly simplifying the validation of linked lists.andP;  Aunique remote mode supports running the debugger on one machine to monitorthe behavior of an application running on a second machine.andM;The debugger can use EMS memory for symbolic information.andP;  A utility convertsMicrosoft-CodeView-compatible object modules to Turbo C format, lettingdevelopers debug function libraries and assembly modules developed with andfor Microsoft products.andM;Although the documentation makes a serious effort to teach, it also includescomprehensive coverage of advanced topics such as mixed-language programming,device drivers, and interrupt handlers.andP;  The library reference is good,losing points only for failing to start functions on new pages.andM;Turbo C's library is of high quality, loaded with functions, and ranks withthe top libraries reviewed.andP;  It conforms to ANSI and supports UNIX well.andP;  Itincludes BIOS-based functions, direct video-memory access, extended screenI/O, and graphics.andP;  The graphics package offers exceelent control of text ingraphics mode.andM;Turbo C has no trouble with any of the benchmarks.andP;  It was easily the fastestcompiler reviewed and ranked third to WATCOM C and Zortech C in averageexecution speed.andP;  However, program sizes were larger than average.andM;Turbo C did well on the ANSI conformance tests, ranking second and passing 60of 79.andM;WATCOM CandM;The WATCOM C development system from Watcom Products Inc. includes all thepieces--driver, editor, linker, librarian, UNIX-style make facility,stand-alone debugger, assembler, several useful utilities such as grep and across-referencer, and a fully integrated environment named Express C.andM;The Express C interface, which WATCOM also uses for the stand-alone editor,is reminiscent of UCSD Pascal editors.andP;  It manipulates files with get and putcommands and presents major operations in a spreadsheet-style menu.andP;  Otheroperations are entered on a command line.andP;  The editor is awkward, withseveral nonintuitive modes.andP;  For example, simply putting text in an emptyfile can be awkward because the editor must be in insert mode or it won'taccept text on an empty line.andM;The Express C debugger interface consists of a menu bar and pull-down menus.andO;It is much easier to use than the editor.andP;  Unfortunately, the integrateddebugger has severely limited capabilities.andP;  About all it supports isexecution tracing and intermittent dumping of a variable.andP;  Despite thewindowing interface, the debugger cannot continuously monitor variables.andO;When used without the editor, the debugger allows only one pass through theprogram under test.andM;Although the stand-alone debugger, VIDEO, uses a nearly identical interface,it is complete.andP;  However, the structure-follow operation (a modifiedmemory-dump command) isn't as well formatted or as convenient as the graphicinterfaces of Turbo Debugger and CodeView.andM;The linker has an easy-to-use, self-documenting scheme for specifying overlaystructures.andP;  The supplied make facility is highly compatible with UNIX make.andO;WATCOM C's academic heritage shows in the manuals, which is both good andbad.andP;  The well-written manuals both teach and inform.andP;  However, they arereluctant to discuss operating-system-dependent issues such as wild-cardexpansion and linking with other WATCOM languages.andP;  This doesn't imply thatthe manuals lack technical depth.andP;  They include complete, coherentdiscussions of many important subjects such as overlays, mixed-modelprogramming, and WATCOM C's strategy for assigning parameters to registers.andM;WATCOM C has by far the best of the basic libraries--those with few extrassuch as graphics support.andP;  It has very good ANSI compatibility and goodsupport for the unbuffered UNIX I/O functions.andP;  However, WATCOM C wouldprofit from a UNIX _doprnt() and andless;varargs.handgt;.andM;WATCOM C won four of seven execution-time benchmarks and ranked first inaverage execution; only Zortech C could compete.andP;  WATCOM C is, however, aslow compiler.andP;  It took nearly 31 minutes to compile XLISP, with alloptimizations off.andP;  With optimizations on, the compilation lasted 56 minutes!andO;But given the small program sizes (second only to Aztec C) and high speeds,WATCOM C showed shining performance.andM;WATCOM C gains some of its speed with enregistered parameters.andP;  This is thedefault, but can be disabled with a pragma.andP;  WATCOM C usesMicrosoft-compatible object files with enregistering turned off.andM;The benchmark tables do not list results for Express C.andP;  WATCOM furnishesExpress C as a learning and initial development tool; it is not intended formaking final versions of programs.andM;WATCOM C passed 65 of 79 tests in the ANSI sampler, five tests ahead of TurboC, its closest competitor.andP;  This compiler's only major drawback is that itcompiles very slowly.andM;Zortech CandM;Zortech C was the least expensive system as reviewed and it had surprisingperformance for the price.andP;  Zortech C includes a WordStar-like editor and amake facility that differs only slightly from UNIX make.andP;  The editor handlesmultiple files and buffers and includes extensive on-line help.andP;  Aself-contained, language-help subsystem is accessible from other editors andfrom the command line.andP;  A special compiler option in the editor invokes maketo rebuild the current project.andM;Zortech C also includes a driver, librarian, and linker.andP;  The major missingpiece is a debugger.andP;  However, this is forgivable in a $50 package, and thedocumentation includes instructions for preparing output for Microsoft'sCodeView debugger.andM;Zortech's manual is well-written and organized, although it has some problemswith omissions and contradictions.andP;  The library reference is good with twoexceptions.andP;  The section on mouse functions does not explain how thefunctions are used.andP;  Instead, it cites the Microsoft documentation.andP;  Themanual would profit from more information on how to use the graphicsfunctions.andP;  An example implementation of a simple, mouse-driven, paintprogram would be a good solution to both problems.andM;Zortech C includes a good library that is highly ANSI compatible.andP;  The UNIXfunctions--primarily low-level I/O functions--are compatible.andP;  However, thelibrary would profit from more UNIX functions such as _doprnt and ioctl().andO;DOS and BIOS support includes a set of BIOS-access routines and typicalMS-DOS routines.andM;Extra capabilities include mouse-support functions and a basic (thoughuseful) graphics library.andP;  Graphics support includes the usual lines, arcs,circles, and ellipses, and moving objects over other objects on the screen.andO;The graphics functions support all common display adapters--CGA, VGA, EGA,Hercules, and Toshiba 3100.andP;  Higher-level functions such as rubber-bandingand hatching would be useful, but this set is a good start.andM;Zortech C was one of the fastest compilers in the benchmark tests.andP;  With theoptimizer enabled, it made some of the fastest programs, ranking second onlyto WATCOM C in average execution speed and beating WATCOM in three of theseven individual tests.andP;  XLISP caused problems.andP;  Zortech C's documentation onincreasing stack size is poorly written.andP;  The /stack option for the linkerhas no effect on stack size.andP;  Instead, the integer variable _stack must beset to the desired stack size.andM;Zortech C passed 42 of 79 ANSI sampler tests, coming in just below average.andO;Zortech C ompiled the &quot;volatile&quot; test but failed to handle it correctly.andM;The bottom lineandM;C has come a long way on MS-DOS systems since IBM introduced the PC.andP;  Itsjourney has been a fruitful one, as evidenced by the rich array ofdevelopment systems reviewed here.andP;  Early packages usually were notdevelopment systems at all, just compilers and perhaps a linker.andP;  Now many Csystem vendors offer most, if not all, of the tools needed for serioussoftware development.andP;  And the range of development systems is wide enough tosatisfy the needs of programmers from budget-minded novices to seriousprofessionals.andM;If a tool is missing, a third-party vendor almost certainly sells it.andP;  Manysoftware vendors specialize in C add-on products such as enhancedgeneral-purpose libraries, special-purpose libraries for everything fromserial communications to advanced database management to scientificproblem-solving, and screen-design packages that generate C source code.andO;Sophisticated debuggers, overlaying linkers, make facilities, and editorsespecially configured for C are available.andP;  It is doubtful that programmershave more high-quality development systems and supplementary tools from whichto choose for any other language in any other environment.andM;However, as always, there is room for improvement.andP;  The debuggers in thefully integrated environments--Turbo C, QuickC, and Express C--wereuniversally disappointing.andP;  For example, none had a good trace-back facilityor could evaluate a function entered from the command line.andP;  And nonedetected even the most blatant violations of heap or stack integrity.andM;The libraries offer extensive sets of functions, but all are missingsomething.andP;  Only Aztec C supports ioctl() the UNIX, low-level, I/O-controlfunction.andP;  None extends signal() sufficiently, for example, to access thetimer interrupt.andP;  Vendors that support graphics could add a layer ofwindow-management functions, ideally compatible with the UNIX cursesfacility.andP;  A set of simple disk-based, database management utilities such asa small b-tree package would be welcome addition.andM;All the manuals would benefit from improving the examples, which are oftentoo trivial to be useful.andP;  For example, signal() is universallyunderdocumented.andP;  No vendor clearly explains how to implement afloating-point exception (SIG_FPE) trap.andM;As the results from the 79 tests reveal, most compilers have a long way to goto become truly ANSI compatible.andP;  The shining stars in the ANSI-conformancetest were the WATCOM C and Turbo C compilers, which come close to fullconformance.andP;  Others are well on their way.andM;With a cornucopia of C systems and tools, high-quality, extensive libraries,and the added benefits an official standard C will bring, C is becoming thekey language for MS-DOS programming.andP;  No matter how large or technicallydemanding your project is, you should consider C for the job.andM;Happy coding!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
