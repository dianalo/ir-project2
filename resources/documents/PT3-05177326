The array is formed from a length of bare wire which is      appropriately folded and bent to provide interconnections between the      contact pads on the leadless chip carrier and contact pads on the printed      wiring board, which are then separated by removing portions of the lead      wire array after its attachment to the leadless chip carrier. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates to an improvement in the surface mounting of a      leadless chip carrier to a printed wiring board. </PAR><PAR>  A leadless chip carrier is an integrated circuit package which includes a      ceramic substrate on which there is provided a pattern of contact pads. A      corresponding pattern of contact pads is provided on a printed wiring      board. When the leadless chip carrier is mounted to the printed wiring      board, the patterns of contact pads are electrically interconnected. </PAR><PAR>  Various approaches to the mounting and electrical interconnection of a      leadless chip carrier to a printed wiring board have been proposed and      implemented in the past. All of the known approaches are disadvantageous      for one or more reasons. One approach is to provide a connector socket for      receiving the leadless chip carrier on the printed wiring board. This      approach is relatively expensive. Another approach is to directly solder      the contact pads of the leadless chip carrier to the contact pads of the      printed wiring board. Since the leadless chip carrier has a ceramic      substrate, it has a low coefficient of thermal expansion. Therefore,      unless the coefficient of thermal expansion of the printed wiring board      matches that of the leadless chip carrier, a reliability problem ensues.      Printed wiring boards having a coefficient of thermal expansion matching      that of the leadless chip carrier are available, but these are expensive. </PAR><PAR>  Another mounting approach is the use of a Chip Carrier Mounting Device (a      trademark of Raychem Corp.) which is an array of high temperature solder      wire leads having an imbedded helical copper braid. This array is held in      place by a dissolvable carrier which is temporary, the carrier being used      to facilitate alignment of the wire leads to the contact pads of the      leadless carrier. The carrier is removed after the leads are soldered to      the leadless chip carrier. Disadvantages of this approach include the use      of the temporary carrier which has a limited shelf life and is adversely      affected by humidity. Additionally, limited stress relief is provided by      the leads, which limits the size of the leadless chip carrier when      implemented on standard printed wiring boards. </PAR><PAR>  Another approach is the use of edge clips, which are created from metal      stampings and are available on continuous reels. The edge clips are      intended to clip onto the edge of the leadless chip carrier using a spring      retention mechanism. Some disadvantages of edge clips are that they do not      fit many leadless chip carrier packages and they are frequently difficult      to assemble to leadless chip carriers. Additionally, the use of edge clips      results in excessively high leadless chip carrier standoffs, which reduces      packaging density. </PAR><PAR>  It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an approach      for mounting and electrically interconnecting a leadless chip carrier to a      printed wiring board which is economical and which does not possess the      disadvantages of the approaches described above. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The foregoing, and additional, objects are attained in accordance with the      principles of this invention by providing a lead wire array for mounting      and electrically interconnecting a leadless chip carrier to a printed      wiring board. The lead wire array comprises a length of bare wire formed      into a planar serpentine shape having a plurality of parallel segments      each connected by reversing segments at its ends to the next adjacent      parallel segments on either side. The formed wire is then folded about a      line orthogonal to the parallel segments so as to be in two substantially      parallel and spaced apart planes with connecting segments therebetween.      The parallel segments in the first plane are then attached to respective      contact pads on the leadless chip carrier and the parallel segments in the      second plane are attached to respective contact pads on the printed wiring      board. The reversing segments are then removed so that individual contact      pads on the leadless chip carrier are mounted and electrically connected      to individual contact pads on the printed wiring board by portions of a      respective parallel segment and a respective connecting segment. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with an aspect of this invention, there is provided a carrier      board which holds the lead wire array prior to its attachment to the      leadless chip carrier and the printed wiring board. The carrier board      comprises a planar board and a plurality of posts secured to the planar      board in locations corresponding to the relative positions of the      reversing segments of the lead wire array. The posts are sized, shaped and      located on the planar board so that the reversing segments can be wrapped      around respective ones of the posts to removably secure the lead wire      array to the carrier board for transportation and subsequent registration. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The foregoing will be more readily apparent upon reading the following      description in conjunction with the drawings in which like elements in      different figures thereof are identified by the same reference numeral and      wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1A is a perspective view of a leadless chip carrier showing a typical      pattern of contact pads; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1B is a perspective view of a portion of a printed wiring board      showing the corresponding pattern of contact pads; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 illustrates a prior art approach for directly soldering the contact      pads of a leadless chip carrier to those of a printed wiring board; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 illustrates a prior art Chip Carrier Mounting Device for mounting a      leadless chip carrier to a printed wiring board; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 illustrates a prior art edge clip for mounting a leadless chip      carrier to a printed wiring board; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5A is a top view illustrating a first step in forming a lead wire      array according to this invention, and FIG. 5B is a side view thereof; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6A is a top view illustrating a second step in the formation of a lead      wire array according to this invention, FIG. 6B is a side view thereof,      and FIG. 6C is an enlarged detail of a portion of FIG. 6B; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7A is a top view illustrating a third step in the formation of a lead      wire array according to a first embodiment of this invention, and FIG. 7B      is a side view thereof; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8A is a top view illustrating a third step in the formation of a lead      wire array according to a second embodiment of this invention, and FIG. 8B      is a side view thereof; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9A is a top view illustrating a fourth step in the formation of a lead      wire array according to a first embodiment of this invention, and FIG. 9B      is a side view thereof; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10A is a top view illustrating a fourth step in the formation of a      lead wire array according to a second embodiment of this invention, and      FIG. 10B is a side view thereof; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 illustrates a carrier board and a lead wire array according to this      invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 illustrates the attachment of the first embodiment of a lead wire      array according to this invention to a leadless chip carrier; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 13 illustrates the final steps in the mounting and electrically      interconnection of a leadless chip carrier to a printed wiring board,      according to a first embodiment of this invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION </PAC><PAR>  Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1A shows a typical leadless chip      carrier 20 which includes a ceramic substrate with a major surface 22. On      the surface 22 is a pattern of contact pads 24 which typically extend      along the edges of the surface 22. FIG. 1B shows a portion of a printed      wiring board 26 to which the leadless chip carrier 20 is to be mounted.      The printed wiring board 26 has a major surface 28 on which there is a      pattern of contact pads 30 corresponding to the pattern of contact pads      24. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 illustrates the direct soldering of the contact pads 24 of the      leadless chip carrier 20 to the contact pads 30 of the printed wiring      board 26. Unless the printed wiring board 30 has a coefficient of thermal      expansion which matches that of the ceramic carrier 20, the solder joint      32 is subject to failure. The reason for matching the coefficients of      thermal expansion is to minimize stresses induced in the solder joint 32      which provides the electrical interconnection between the leadless chip      carrier 20 and the printed wiring board 26. The approaches most commonly      utilized for controlling the coefficient of thermal expansion of the      printed wiring board 26 are to utilize thick film ceramic printed wiring      boards, to utilize composite printed wiring boards having low coefficient      of thermal expansion metal cores laminated within the printed wiring board      structure or to utliize low coefficient of thermal expansion reinforcing      fibers within the dielectric material making up the printed wiring board.      However, the costs associated with these approaches can be prohibitive. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 illustrates a chip carrier mounting device 34 bonded to the contact      pads 24 by a solder joint 36 and bonded to the contact pads 30 by a solder      joint 38. As previously discussed, there are numerous disadvantages to      this approach. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 illustrates an edge clip lead 40 connected by a solder joint 42 to      the contact pads 30 and by a solder joint 44 to the contact pads 24. The      edge clip lead 40 is attached to a carrier strip 46 which is frangible at      48 so that the carrier strip 46 may be snapped off after the soldering is      performed. To assist in the soldering, the edge clip lead 40 may be      provided with a solder preform 50 contained within a curved region of the      clip lead 40. The disadvantages of this approach have been discussed      above. </PAR><PAR>  According to this invention, a lead wire array is advantageously provided      which allows pre-leading of leadless chip carriers for subsequent solder      assembly to a printed wiring board. The lead wire array is formed from a      length of bare wire which is first bent into a planar serpentine shape, as      shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B. This bending results in a plurality of parallel      segments 52 each connected by reversing segments 54 at their ends to the      next adjacent parallel segments on either side. The spacing of the      parallel segments 52 corresponds to the spacing of the contact pads 24,      30. Illustratively, the reversing segments 54 are C-shaped, but other      shapes, such as pointed V-shapes, are possible. </PAR><PAR>  The next step, as illustrated in FIGS. 6A, 6B and 6C is to flatten the      portions of the parallel segments 52 which will eventually be soldered to      the contact pads 24, 30. The reason for flattening the wire is to provide      a greater surface area for the soldering step. This is accomplished by      utilizing a coining tool 56. If desired, the coining tool 56 can have a      sharp point 58 (FIG. 6C) so that the flattened portion 60 of the parallel      segment 52 has a frangible region 62 adjacent the reversing segment 54 for      a subsequent snap-off operation. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIGS. 7A, 7B, 8A and 8B, the next step is to fold the wire      about a line orthogonal to the parallel segments 52 so that the flattened      portions 60 are in either a first plane or a second plane. The first and      second planes are substantially parallel to and spaced from each other. In      a first embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, the folding includes      forming a C-shaped bend of the parallel segments 52, preferably about a      mandrel 64. In this embodiment, all the reversing segments 54 extend in      the same direction from the C-shaped bend. In a second embodiment, as      illustrated in FIGS. 8A and 8B, the folding includes two oppositely      directed bending steps to form a Z-shaped bend, wherein the reversing      segments 54 extend in opposite directions. </PAR><PAR>  As illustrated in FIGS. 9A, 9B, 10A and 10B, the foregoing steps are      repeated for the second side of the leadless chip carrier 20. Although not      shown, these steps are repeated twice more for the third and fourth sides      of the leadless chip carrier 20. </PAR><PAR>  The resulting lead wire array 66 is shown in FIG. 11. To assist in      transporting the lead wire array 66, and aligning it for attachment to the      leadless chip carrier 20, there is provided a carrier board 68. The      carrier board 68 includes a planar board 70 having secured thereto a first      plurality of posts 72 and a second plurality of posts 74. The posts 72 and      74 are so sized, shaped and located on the planar board 70 that the lower      reversing segments 54 can be placed around the posts 72 and the upper      reversing segments 54 can be placed around the posts 74 (FIG. 12) in such      a manner that the lead wire array 66 is removably secured to the carrier      board 68. Thus, after its formation, the lead wire array 66 is easily      transportable. In addition, the carrier board 68 functions to properly      register the leadless chip carrier 20 with respect to the lead wire array      66 for its attachment thereto. To perform this function, the posts 74 are      formed with a ledge, or abutment, 76 which is at the appropriate height so      that when the major surface 22 of the leadless chip carrier 20 is placed      thereon, the contact pads 24 engage the flattened portions 60. The posts      74 also have abutments 78 terminating the ledges 76 so that the four rows      of abutments 78 from the four rows of posts 74 form an enclosure for the      leadless chip carrier 20 which properly registers it with respect to the      lead wire array 66. </PAR><PAR>  The carrier board 60 may also be formed with members 80 which serve to      align a heat sink 82 for its attachment to the leadless chip carrier 20,      in a conventional manner. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 13 illustrates the final steps in the assembly of the leadless chip      carrier 20 to the printed wiring board 26. After solder paste is applied      to the contact pads 24 of the leadless chip carrier 20, the leadless chip      carrier 20 is placed onto the carrier board 68 which aligns the contact      pads 24 with the lead wire array 66, as described above. If desired, a      heat sink is also appropriately registered, as described above. This      assembly of the leadless chip carrier 20, the lead wire array 66, and the      carrier board 68 is then placed into a reflow oven for solder attachment      of the lead wire array 66 to the leadless chip carrier 20. After the      assembly cools and is cleaned, the carrier board 68 is removed from the      leadless chip carrier 20/lead wire array 66 assembly. The portion of the      lead wire array 66 which extends beyond the outline of the leadless chip      carrier 20 is then removed. This portion comprises the reversing segments      54. Such removal may be accomplished either by shearing or by snapping at      the frangible region 62. After the unwanted reversing segments 54 have      been removed, the now pre-leaded leadless chip carrier 20 may be located      onto the printed wiring board 26 for final solder assembly. </PAR><PAR>  There has thus been disclosed a simple, low cost technique for the      formation of compliant high reliability leads for the pre-leading of a      leadless chip carrier. This technique allows reliable mounting of high      input/output count leadless chip carriers to standard printed wiring      boards due to its small cross-section and bend configuration for maximum      compliance with minimum length. It also allows reliable mounting of      leadless chip carriers to standard printed wiring boards using small      component stand-offs for maximum packaging density. The lead wire array      can be provided with an integral heat sink/carrier to minimize assembly      cost and can easily be adapted to fine pitch leadless devices having      perimeter contact pads down to 25 mil center pitch. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, there has been disclosed an improvement in the surface      mounting of a leadless chip carrier to a printed wiring board. While a      preferred embodiment of the present invention has been disclosed herein,      it is understood that various modifications and adaptations to the      disclosed arrangement will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the      art and it is only intended that this invention be limited by the scope of      the appended claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
