People who owe tax will get fewer benefits from filingcomputer-ready returns by wire than did the 4.2 millionelectronic filers whose 1990 refunds arrived faster. But theywill get receipts for their returns and help reduce errors.The IRS is eager for the processing advantages. So it plansin 1991 to have its Cincinnati center accept balance-duereturns from preparers filing electronically from WestVirginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Michigan.</LP><TEXT>   If the test works, the program will be made national in1992. The returns can be filed early; preparers will supplytaxpayers with payment vouchers to mail with their checks byApril 15. Thus, payment won't be paperless; but the IRS isexperimenting with that. Its Andover, Mass., center this yearaccepted six returns reporting taxes paid by wire transfersfrom a bank. The bank advanced the funds for six customersand billed their credit-card accounts.   The IRS isn't allowed to take credit-card payments. Banksmay lend money for taxes in any form they choose.                                                                                                          EMPLOYERS' ERRORS in wage reports to Social Securitymuddle many accounts.   Social Security runs on records: It credited over $2trillion in 1988 earnings to 130 million workers -- relyingon 265 million wage and self-employment-pay reports. But eachyear, it faces over a million discrepancies between reportsto it and to the IRS. Three million more reports are shuntedto a &quot;suspense file&quot; while the agency tries to clear upmissing or faulty employer and employee ID numbers and tocorrect other errors, so many workers lose credits for theSocial Security taxes they pay.   Social Security Commissioner King says the agency istaking many steps to instruct employers on filing correctlyand workers on checking their accounts. The IRS is startingto assess penalties on employers who file withholding-taxreports late, improperly, or not at all. And new rulesrequire employers to certify that they are reporting the sameinformation to both agencies.                                                                                                          PAPERLESS PAYMENTS of state business taxes by wire arespreading widely.   Fourteen states require businesses to make certain largepayments by electronic transfers between banks; the numberadopting the more efficient and accurate systems may doubleby 1991, officials say. Indiana collects $3 billion a yearthis way from concerns owing at least $20,000 a month incorporate-income, sales, payroll-withholding, and fuel taxes.New Mexico gets over $80 million a month from 503 concernsremitting sales, withholding, and oil-and-gas taxes.   Electronic transfers help states manage cash flow andraise interest-earning bank balances. But multistatecorporations worry about coping with a different system ineach state. So uniform standards are being developed andpromoted jointly by the Federation of Tax Administrators, astate officials' group; the Committee on State Taxation, acorporate group, and the National Automated Clearing HouseAssociation. Most states are adopting these standards.   In New England, the IRS is about to start testingelectronic collections of corporate federal tax deposits.                                                                                                          INTENSIFIED AUDITS of small pension plans have pensiondesigners and their clients fuming. But the Supreme Court hasrefused to review a seventh-circuit appeals-court ruling onwhich the IRS relies. In that case, the IRS discreditedassumptions used in the tax-deductible funding of a plan forJerome Mirza andamp; Associates Ltd.                                                                                                          A FOURGONE CONCLUSION? In a fourth straight case, the TaxCourt imposed damages of $5,000 on Orian E. Wright ofCalifornia for filing frivolous tax-protester pleas. Heappealed the three prior rulings to the ninth-circuit appealscourt; it has upheld two and recently ordered Wright to pay$1,500 for a frivolous appeal.                                                                                                          SALES TAXES are climbing again. Oklahoma's rose to 4.5%from 4% on May 1. On July 1, Kentucky's goes to 6% from 5%and New Mexico's to 5% from 4.75%. Nebraska's rises to 5%from 4% on July 10. North Dakota voters will decide June 12whether to raise their tax to 6% from 5% for a year.                                                                                                          THEY WORKED IN deductible business losses when they laidplans to work out.   Bill Upton, Wayne E. Schirmer, and other professional menof Moberly, Mo., formed an S corporation in 1982 to own ahealth club for them. S concerns are taxed much likepartnerships; the founders noted that the 25 stockholders notonly would get free family memberships for their $8,000investments, but also could deduct personal shares of theclub's losses. They sold some other memberships, mainly byword of mouth; but the losses ranged from $13,954 to $21,352in the club's first five years.   The IRS denied the holders' 1982 deductions, saying theclub didn't have a profit motive. Now Tax Court Judge Shieldshas upheld the IRS; the tax and recreational benefits showthe club wasn't run for profit, he says. The owners had noexpertise in running a club, didn't get expert advice, anddidn't hire a staff. They did &quot;virtually nothing&quot; to recruitpaying members.   Indeed, the judge notes, the club didn't even put up asign to show the public what was available inside.
