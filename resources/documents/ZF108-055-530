(CCL) is attempting to help DEC bringIBM System 36 and 38 users into the VMS fold.andM;The Tel Aviv-based company recently opened offices here and announced anautomatic conversion service that ports applications from IBM's System 36 andSystem 38 computers to VMS Cobol.andM;The Easymig conversion process takes two to five months.andP;  The customer sendstapes containing screens, programs, files and a system command language toCCL's Tel Aviv headquarters, where the conversions take place.andM;&quot;We've sold it to four customers in Israel.andP;  Digital is [now] helping us topromote this service in the U.S.,&quot; said CCL President Martin Templeman.andM;CCL uses Easymig software to convert System 36 files into VMS RMS files andSystem 38 files into VMS Rdb files.andP;  Forms are converted to FMS forms, theJob Command Language is converted to DCL command procedures, and IMB and RPGprograms and IBM Cobol programs are converted to VMS Cobol.andP;  All referencesto file and screen I/O are handled in routines outside the main application.andM;The service also includes database conversion software that is sent to thecustomer.andP;  The customer can convert the database himself or, for about$10,000 a month, a CCL technician will perform the task at the customer'ssite.andM;'Window of Opportunity'andM;A small database can be converted in about one month; very large databasesrequire about three months, according to Templeman.andM;Pointing to difficulties experienced by System 36 users converting to IBM'sflagship AS/400, he said, &quot;There are about 96,000 installations of System 36salone.andP;  We have a window of opportunity to start drawing customers away fromIBM to Digital.&quot;andM;&quot;We are really pushing very hard,&quot; said Moshe Brown, business manager forDEC's Israeli subsidiary in the United States.andP;  &quot;We are working with CCLinternally here even though there's no official relationship.andP;  We have[briefed] all sales district managers in the U.S.,&quot; Brown said.andM;Industrsy analysts said the conversion scheme is a good one, but areskeptical about whether many conversions will take place.andP;  &quot;This gives[users] a means to consider another environment, but it's a veryniche-oriented product,&quot; said Michael Killen, president of Killen andAssociates, a Santa Clara, Calif., market research company.andM;&quot;For a very limited number of customers, it's a pretty nice deal, buthistorically there's very little cross-data shopping,&quot; said John Jones, asenior analyst at Montgomery Securities, a San Francisco investment researchcompany.andM;Jones said the IBM market remains a difficult one for DEC to crack becausemost customers who change systems &quot;migrate from a third-tier or second-tierplayer to DEC rather than from IBM to DEC.&quot;andM;Also, the AS/400 is a strong product that's worth the conversion woes,analysts said.andP;  &quot;While the conversion is a difficult one, 31 percent of IBM'sAS/400 customers have converted from the System 36,&quot; Jones said.andM;The Easymig program isn't the only solution DEC is using to woo customersfrom Big Blue.andP;  DEC's Colorado facility also does IBM-to-DEC migrations.andM;But considering IBM's own System 36 conversion offerings to the AS/400, DEChas decided to support Easymig as well.andP;  &quot;I don't think we have too muchtime,&quot; DEC's Brown said.andP;  &quot;That's why we decided to go in parallel.&quot;andM;Prices for Easymig depend on the number of programs to be converted.andP;  Forexample, a 100-program, 100-procedure conversion would be about $50,000;converting 1,000 programs, 200 procedures, 200 screens, 25 logical files and25 physical files would be about $200,000, Templeman said.andP;  A very largecustomer with 4,000 programs would pay about $400,000, he said.andP;  As a trialoffer, CCL will convert 10 programs for 10 percent of the total conversioncost.andP;  The trial conversion takes two to three weeks, Templeman said.andM;Creative Consultants Ltd. is located at 28 Broadway, Suite 400, New York, NY10004, (212) 837-7880.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
