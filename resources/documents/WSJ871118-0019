The dollar rose Monday, triggering widespread gains for stocks.    Continuing to keep many traders from participating was uncertainty about the U.S. deliberations on cutting the budget deficit.    In Tokyo, share prices closed lower on profit-taking in light volume.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks, which rose 167.18 points Monday, fell 271.15 to finish the afternoon session at 22344.28. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index fell 20.11 to 1833.96. Turnover in the first section was estimated at 250 million shares, down from 300 million Monday.    At the end of the morning session Wednesday, the Nikkei was up 66.26 points at 22410.54.    Traders said a pronounced downturn in Tuesday afternoon turnover on the Nikkei was perplexing, given Monday's gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei's bullish morning start. Shrinking investor interest during the day was ascribed to the fact most shares in the first section index have recovered about 30% of their value since the Oct. 20 plunge, sparking cautious profit-taking.    An early morning advance on the Nikkei of roughly 40 points was erased by the dollar's slip in the Tokyo currency markets. The dollar in Tokyo opened at 136.88 yen and moved lower to about 136.25.    &quot;It's really mixed today,&quot; said one broker, noting that export-led stocks tended to be spotty while the rest of the market drifted lower on aimless profit-taking.    In export-led electrical and computer shares, Kyocera, a maker of ceramic jackets for computer chips, fell 80 yen to 4,900 ($35.75). Matsushita Electric Industrial fell 50 to 2,140, NEC slipped 30 to 1,950, and Hitachi dropped 30 to 1,210. ALPS Electric, however, rose 30 to 1,790. Japan Victor rose 30 to 2,400.    In car manufacturing shares, Honda fell 20 to 1,240.    Traders were divided about the outlook for Japanese share prices later this week. While some wrote off Tuesday's moderate decline as the inevitable result of three consecutive advances on the Nikkei, others were disappointed about the stumble in what was expected to be a bullish investment week.    Many said investors are closely monitoring final deliberations on a U.S. budget deficit-reducing package and are taking a wait-and-see attitude.    Share prices in London closed lower and at the day's worst level as the market reacted to a weak trend on Wall Street and uncertainty about the U.S. budget prospects.    The Financial Times 30-share index was off 15.0 points to 1310.6 at the close. Volume was a modest 671.2 million shares, down from 704.8 million shares a day earlier. The 100-share index was off 24.6 to 1660.1 at the close.    Share prices staged a rally around midday, moving into plus territory for a few hours, after the release of figures showing the government had a #1 billion budget surplus for October. The large surplus reinforced predictions of further tax cuts, dealers said.    The market returned to negative territory after Wall Street opened lower. London shares then followed New York down to touch their low point at the close.    Volume in British Petroleum new shares was very high at 274 million. Dealers said there were continuing rumors of share purchases by the London-based investment arm of the Kuwaiti government. The BP new shares were heavily traded Monday amid similar rumors.    BP new shares rose 6 pence to 85 pence ($1.48). The old shares were up 8 at 258.    Among the widely traded stocks, Imperial Chemical Industries was off 30 at #10.20 ($17.80), Glaxo Holdings fell 33 to #10.38, and Jaguar dropped 15 to 307.    Share prices closed sharply lower on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange after investors took a double blow from the dollar's fall and Siemens AG's decision to cut its dividend, brokers said. The market's index dropped 14.57 points, or 3.2%, to 442.42.    Although lower on the day, shares were up from the opening, when stock prices lost between 5% and 10%.    Brokers traced the market's sour mood to the Siemens decision to cut its fiscal 1987 dividend. Analysts said the relatively weak performance of the company, which is the country's biggest electrical group, could presage a wider corporate earnings decline in West Germany.    Adding to the gloom, the dollar fell to a Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing rate of 1.6972 marks from 1.7159 marks amid doubts that the U.S. will be able to come up with a credible deficit reduction.    A slump in Tokyo stocks before the start of Frankfurt dealing also weakened the market, brokers said.    On the other hand, news of a sharp pretax profit increase at chemical group Hoechst for the first nine months of 1987 buoyed the market later in the day. Chemical stocks closed only slightly lower as a result of the report.    In the electrical sector, Siemens plunged 17.5 marks to 391 ($230), but it was up from lows of around 370. AEG was down 10.3 to 234.    Among chemical issues, Hoechst was off 0.5 to 255, Bayer eased 4 to 275, and BASF slipped 1 to 257. Schering gained 2 to 405.    Elsewhere in Europe, Milan was the only exchange showing gains -- and those were erased in unofficial post-session dealing, traders said. Prices fell in Paris, Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam and Stockholm.    In Paris, traders said investors were disappointed by conflicting signals on the state of negotiations to reduce the U.S. budget deficit. The weakness of the dollar also discouraged investors, they said. Dealers in other European markets cited similar concerns.    Share prices closed lower in Singapore and Hong Kong but rose in Sydney.    The Australian share prices closed higher on news that the current account deficit was narrower than expected, which sent interest rates down. Early gains were trimmed in afternoon trading following the drop on the Tokyo market.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                      % This                                Nov 16     Nov 13      Year    U.S. ...................... 230.7      229.3     +  1.2    Britain ................... 504.8      502.3     +  1.4    Canada .................... 331.0      330.6     -  0.6    Japan .................... 1100.1     1095.4     + 16.4    France .................... 317.1      301.4     - 22.3    Germany ................... 169.3      166.6     - 34.8    Hong Kong ................ 1628.3     1581.7     -  8.5    Switzerland ............... 157.9      154.4     - 21.4    Australia ................. 251.8      249.0     -  4.6    World index ............... 396.5      395.4     + 11.1</TEXT></DOC>
