Foundation grantsincreased an inflation-adjusted 4%.   The trust, established by the American Association of FundRaising Counsel to track charitable and philanthropic giving,attributed the growth in individual giving to several things:a jump in personal income of nearly 9%, an average increaseof 21% in stock prices and growing public awareness of ofcauses such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome,homelessness and environmental crises. Individual giving hasoutpaced inflation almost every year since 1955, when thetrust began monitoring such trends.   Religion was the main beneficiary.
