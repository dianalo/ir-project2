On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, advanced 34cents to close at $20.57 a barrel after trading as high as $21 abarrel. Contracts for delivery later in the year showed more modestgains.   Among refined oil products, unleaded gasoline prices fell on whatanalysts said was a late bout of profit-taking. Unleaded gasolinefor July delivery fell 0.48 cent to finish at 59.44 cents a gallon,while contracts for later delivery also declined.   July heating oil rose 0.61 cent to 46.26 cents a gallon, pulledup by crude prices, energy brokers said. The contract rose 1.07cents in Wednesday's session.   Analysts said there was little economic news to drive crudeprices higher. However, a change in the method of delivery of crudeoil to various customers had some investors worried.   Traders said some customers who had been receiving WTI weregetting similar light, sweet crude that met their specifications butwas not WTI.   ``What we're seeing is for some reason a bit of a panic ondelivery of spot crude,'' said Greg Dreis, a broker with MerrillLynch Energy Futures. ``The contract just says it must be a sweet,light crude, and some WTI is being replaced with foreign and otheroil.''   Observers said that in some cases buyers who want only WTI arebeing asked to pay extra for delivery.   Analysts said July crude prices also were pushed higher byinvestors buying before the contract expires on Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
