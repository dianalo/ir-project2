Robert Garcia goes on trial this weekon charges he, his wife and her lawyer extorted $185,000, includinga diamond and emerald necklace, from Wedtech, the now-defunctdefense contractor.   The 56-year-old Democrat is accused of using his position toobtain the payoffs from Wedtech, once acclaimed as a model ofminority-owned businesses.   This is likely to be the last of seven trials from the Wedtechscandal. Already convicted were such figures as Rep. Mario Biaggi,D-N.Y., and Stanley Simon, borough president of the Bronx.   Jury selection was set to begin today in federal court; openingarguments are scheduled a week later. Garcia faces up to 20 years inprison.   Garcia was indicted in November, three days after Biaggi drew aneight-year sentence in a Wedtech racketeering case. Biaggi resignedfrom the U.S. House and is in prison.   Garcia, his wife, Jane Lee, and lawyer Ralph Vallone Jr. areaccused of a bribery-extortion scheme to get $185,000 from Wedtechofficials in checks, interest-free loans and, for Mrs. Garcia, ajeweled necklace.   Because of illness, Vallone's trial was postponed until thespring, The New York Times reported today.   The government is expected to present witnesses who will testifythat Garcia demanded payments from Wedtech that were routed throughhis wife's political consulting business.   The indictment said the payments were demanded to influenceGarcia's ``performance of official acts for and on behalf ofWedtech.''   Garcia, the son of a Pentecostal minister, since 1978 hasrepresented a a district that includes the South Bronx.   Wedtech, once a small South Bronx machine shop, grew into a $100million government contractor through a federal program that setaside contracts without bidding for minority-controlled companies.   Evidence at earlier trials showed Wedtech continued to receiveno-bid contracts through bribery even after it ceased to beminority-owned. It went out of business in 1986 after allegationsabout illegal activity were made public.</TEXT></DOC>
