Because of the shortcomings, HUD ``cannot be sure'' money awardedfor the projects was being spent ``in the most efficient andeconomical way,'' said the audit report released Aug. 21.   The Butte housing authority operates 356 low-income housing units_ 214 for senior citizens and 142 for families. The assistanceprogram provides money to improve their physical condition andupgrade their management. As of March 1989, $4.8 million had beenapproved for the projects.   The audit was conducted in April and May of this year.   The housing authority made budget changes without followingwritten procedures, particularly concerning the addition to the1986-87 budgets of $639,000 to remove lead-based paint and $100,000to repair or demolish a building, the audit said. Because of thosechanges, other items budgeted for those years, such as $251,000 forwater heaters and heating units, were postponed to 1988.   HUD regulations call for submission of a formal budget revisionwhen a major change is made.   The audit found that the Butte housing authority charged expensesto the wrong accounts, didn't keep adequate accounting records,didn't use available resources such as $17,000 worth of computerequipment, requested money before spending what it already had andfailed to cancel invoices to ensure bills weren't paid more thanonce.   The audit also determined that the authority didn't follow HUDrequirements in awarding contracts. Among other discrepancies, theauthority failed to advertise or obtain HUD approval for contractsover $10,000, as required.   Butte did meet HUD requirements for developing and implementing afive-year plan to meet the projects' physical needs but didn'tprovide a rolling five-year plan, which would outline futurefinancial needs.   The Inspector General's office instructed the Butte PublicHousing Authority to provide within 60 days a report on action takento remedy the problems or why action is not needed.</TEXT></DOC>
