Jimmy Swaggart'salleged sexual misconduct, says a minister who has talked to thetelevision evangelist.   ``I hope to God there aren't any more'' sex scandals, added GlynLowery, pastor of Pace Assembly of God in this Pensacola suburb.``I don't know how we'll stand many more scandals in the Assembliesof God. It has shaken our movement tremendously.''   Another Assemblies of God television evanglist, Jim Bakker, wasthe subject of earlier reports that he had sex with a churchsecretary.   Lowery was one of about a half-dozen ministers called to BatonRouge, La., to counsel Swaggart in the wake of reports he had beenphotographed with a prostitute in New Orleans.   ``He is a broken man,'' Lowery said Sunday. ``As he told me,`Glyn, nobody could exact any punishment on me greater than thatwhich I put upon my own self for what I done.' ''   Church officials have proposed to relieve Swaggart of hisministry for three months.   ``Some preachers feel like he needs a year out of the pulpit;others don't,'' Lowery said. ``For him to stay out of the pulpitfor a year would be a death sentence to his ministry ... but that'ssomething he should have thought about when he went to NewOrleans.''</TEXT></DOC>
