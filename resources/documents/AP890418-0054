Aides of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and former PrimeMinister Yasuhiro Nakasone profited in the stock deals, but bothmen have denied any personal wrongdoing.   The scandal has seriously eroded public confidence in theTakeshita government, and support for the prime minister fell below4 percent in a poll by Kyodo News Service last week.   The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office today chargedKunio Takaishi, 59, a former vice minister of education who wasarrested on March 28.   He was the 14th person _ all businessmen or bureaucrats _arrested so far in the scandal.   All now have been formally charged, and prosecutors said theywould turn their attention from bureaucracy's part in the scandalto the role of politicians.   Takaishi is accused of receiving bribes from Recruit Co. andproviding favors for the information and publishing conglomerate.   Others who have been charged include Recruit founder HiromasaEzoe; Takashi Kato, a former vice minister of labor; and HisashiShinto, former chairman of Japan's telecommunications giant, NipponTelegraph and Telephone Corp.   Recruit sold unlisted stocks in a subsidiary at bargain pricesto about 160 influential politicians, public officials andbusinessmen. The buyers profited handsomely when the shares werelisted for public trading and shot up in price.   According to a 1988 Supreme Court decision, the sale of stockbound to rise in price and not available to the general publiccould amount to bribery.   At least 17 politicians, including Takeshita and Nakasone, havebeen linked to the scandal directly or through stock purchases byaides.   In addition, Takeshita has acknowledged receiving more than $1million in political contributions from Recruit in 1986 and 1987,but has said the donations all were legal.   Despite repeated demands from opposition parties that he resignand call elections to allow a public judgment, Takeshita has vowedto stay on and push for political reforms.   Passage of the budget for this fiscal year, which began April 1,has been blocked by an opposition boycott of Parliament in supportof demands that Takeshita resign or call Nakasone to Parliament forquestioning about his role in the affair.</TEXT></DOC>
