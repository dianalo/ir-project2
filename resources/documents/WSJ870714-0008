With the guilty plea of Eugene Brower, former mayor of the North Slope Borough, the investigation now centers on a number of prominent borough contractors and consultants during Mr. Brower's three-year tenure, said U.S. Attorney Michael Spaan.    Mr. Brower, who entered his plea in Anchorage, is the third person convicted in the two-year federal grand jury investigation of alleged bribes, kickbacks, fraud and extortion in the borough's billion-dollar public works program. The others, a former borough public works director and a borough representative in Washington, D.C., have also agreed to cooperate with authorities.    Mr. Brower and the borough were subjects of Wall Street Journal stories in 1984 and 1985 chronicling the borough's billion-dollar debt and a federal probe of its finances. The borough, created in 1972 by Eskimo leaders seeking a greater say over local affairs, derived its massive wealth from its ability to tax the North Slope oil fields and TransAlaska pipeline.    Mr. Brower, borough mayor from 1981 until defeated in his reelection bid in 1984, pleaded guilty to one count of tax evasion. He admitted not paying taxes on $42,500 of gifts he received in 1982. Without admitting they were bribes, Mr. Brower acknowledged that the gifts -- a boat, trailer, 175-horsepower outboard motor and groceries -- were part of a &quot;business or commercial&quot; transaction.    In exchange for his guilty plea and for cooperating with authorities, prosecutors agreed to drop two counts of interstate travel in connection with receiving bribes and two counts of failure to file tax returns.    Mr. Brower could be sentenced to five years in prison and fined $100,000. But government attorneys asked that sentencing be delayed until next spring so they and U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland can see how candid his testimony is against others.    Mr. Brower said in a prepared statement he was &quot;relieved&quot; to have the incident behind him. His attorney, William Bryson, said his client is cooperating with authorities and, if necessary, will testify before a grand jury and at a trial.    The grand jury investigation stems in part from an audit of the final days of Mr. Brower's administration in 1984. The audit cited about $15 million in payments approved by Mr. Brower for questionable contracts, in some cases for work that apparently hadn't been completed. The beneficiaries of those contracts included large contributors to Mr. Brower's unsuccessful reelection campaign.    The scandal rocked the Minnesota-sized swath of arctic tundra, where the borough had functioned much like a county government.    Until the scandal broke, Mr. Brower, a whaling captain, was a respected native leader whose family was among the most influential in the borough. He now works as a laborer on a demolition project in Anchorage. </TEXT></DOC>
