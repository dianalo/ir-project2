The informationset forth below does not constitute a requirement for filing, as the publicationof such requirements is the prerogative of the United States Claims Court,but rather provides a statement of what information PHS views as necessaryfor it to carry out its responsibilities under the Program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>National Vaccine Injury CompensationProgram, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 4-101, Rockville, Maryland20857, (301) 443-6593.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Program provides a system of no-faultcompensation for certain individuals who have been injured by specifiedchildhood vaccines. Subtitle 2 of Title XXI of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 300aa-10<T3>et seq</T3>., provides that those seeking compensation are to filea petition with the United States Claims Court, which is responsible foradjudicating the petition. A copy of the petition is also to be servedupon the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who is named as the respondentin each proceeding.Section 2111(c)(2) of the PHS Act provides that each petition is to beaccompained by:<ITAG tagnum="21">All available relevant medical records (including autopsy reports,if any) relating to the person who suffered such injury or who died fromthe administration of the vaccine and an identification of any unavailablerecords known to the petitioner and the reasons for their unavailability* * *.</ITAG>While the United States Claims Court is responsible for issuing rules onthe content of petitions and their accompanying medical and related records,PHS, as the respondent, will have the responsibility of reviewing thesedocuments and advising the Court of its view as to whether compensationshould be awarded. Accordingly, we are advising the public of the informationthat we would view as necessary for us to carry out this responsibility.For petitions that are not accompanied by sufficient information, we intendto request the missing materials, and if they are not provided (or an adequateexplanation of their unavailability is not submitted), we may be forcedto advise the Court that the records submitted are insufficient to supporta determination that the petitioner is entitled to compensation.Under the statue, the determination regarding eligibility for compensationrequires examination of records related to the following: (a) The healthstatus of the injured individual before the administration of the vaccine,(b) information related to the actual administration of the vaccine, (c)the effects of the vaccine, (d) the period in which those effects firstoccurred, and (e) the period for which the effects continued. Accordingly,while we recognize that not all of these materials will be relevant ineach case, the materials that we would view as constituting complete medicaland related records are as follows:1. Maternal prenatal and delivery records;2. Newborn hospital records, including all physicians' and nurses' notesand test results;3. Vaccination records associated with the vaccine allegedly causing theinjury;4. Pre- and post-injury physician or clinic records, including all relevantgrowth charts and test results;5. All post-injury outpatient records, including all provider notes, testresults, and medication records;6. If applicable, death certificate; and7. If applicable, autopsy results (if an autopsy was conducted).We are also requesting that petitioners make every effort to provide medicaland related records that are legible. Clearly, our task of evaluating petitonswill be significantly impeded if the records provided are not legible.Section 2111(c)(3) of the PHS Act provides that petitions for compensationmust also be accompanied by:<ITAG tagnum="21">Appropriate assessments, evaluations, and prognoses and such otherrecords and documents as are reasonably necessary for the determinationof the amount of compensation to be paid to, or on behalf of, the personwho suffered such injury or who died from the administration of the vaccine.</ITAG>This notice does not cover the medical and other records necessary to determinethe amount of compensation once eligibility for compensation has been established.Accordingly, the Secretary (or the Department of Justice, which representsthe Secretary in proceedings before the United States Claims Court) mayrequire additional records in order to determine the amount of compensation.Chapter 35 of Title 44, United States Code, related to paperwork reduction,does not apply to information required for purposes of carrying out theProgram.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 2, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John H.
