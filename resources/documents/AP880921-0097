Sept. 19   The (Baltimore) Sun on gun control:   The House of Representatives shamelessly caved in to thepolitical muscle of the national gun lobby when it rejected amodest measure that would have required a seven-day waiting periodfor the purchase of handguns.   The vote put House members on record against virtually every lawenforcement organization in the country, groups that had pleadedfor this measure known as the ``Brady Amendment'' to assist them intheir jobs. ...   But the House refused to listen, and the reason is transparentand deplorable.   There is no sound argument against a cooling off period. Itwould have caused only minor inconvenience to law-abiding citizens,who could pick up their guns in a week, but would have made itdifficult for criminals to walk into a store and get a handgun withease. ...   Yet, the House buckled under pressure from the well-heeled gunlobby and voted 228-182 against the Brady amendment.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 19   The Birmingham (Ala.) Post-Herald on gun control:   Well, all those hunters can relax. It appears that the federalgovernment is not going to make them wait seven days to get a newor used handgun.   The National Rifle Association convinced the House ofRepresentatives ... that it would be discommoding, not to mentionunAmerican, to require a prospective purchaser to wait a whole weekto pick up a pistol. ...   The waiting-period legislation was cast aside. ... In its place,the House substituted an amendment calling on the JusticeDepartment to develop a system under which gun dealers couldidentify felons who seek to buy handguns.   The chances of the department fashioning a reasonably efficientsystem is doubtful. And even if it does, there's nothing in theamendment that says it should be put into effect.   Thanks to the well-heeled gun lobby, over-the-counter,no-questions-asked sales of handguns can continue.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 20   Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) Sun-Sentinel on the coup in Haiti:   Haiti, the most improvished nation in the Western Hemisphere,may be pathetically short of food, jobs and opportunity, but itseems to possess an inexhaustible supply of military strongmen.   Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, a former adviser to the ousted regime ofJean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier, seized power from Lt. Gen. HenriNamphy on Sunday after a revolt by noncommissioned officers in thePresidential Guard. ...   About the best the administration can do at this time is to leadan international effort to isolate Haiti's corrupt military cliqueuntil moderate elements in the armed forces or a true popularuprising can prevail.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 19   Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat and Chronicle and Times-Union onSocial Security:   When it comes to federal budget deficits, baby boomers should bedemanding more than platitudes from the presidential candidates.   The reason? The deficits ... endanger the Social Securitybenefits the boomers are entitled to.   Here's the problem. Back in 1983, Congress and the Reaganadministration wisely acted to save Social Security with sharplyhigher taxes _ enough to build up $3 trillion in reserves for the74 million baby boomers who'll start retiring in 2010. ...   By law, the Treasury must use all available revenue before itborrows money to cover the deficit. In return, the Social Securitysystem gets government IOUs, theoretically payable on demand. ...   The solution ... is to eliminate or radically shrink thedeficit. Then the surpluses could be used to buy back the nationaldebt from the private citizens and foreign investors who now holdgovernment bonds. ...   So it's up to the boomers. If they don't demand change, the nextpresident and the next Congress may follow the path of leastresistance _ and take the security out of Social Security.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 14   The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tenn., on Congressional pensions:   Want to retire with a million-dollar pension? Get elected toCongress and stay there a while.   The National Taxpayers Union, which keeps track of federalspending, reported that Ben Reifel of South Dakota will this monthbecome the second retired member of Congress to collect more than$1 million since leaving office.   Former Sen. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine collected her firstmillion in May. In November, former Sen. Albert Gore Sr. ofTennessee will join the club. No doubt they will be joined shortlyby many more.   Reifel and Gore, who retired in 1971, and Mrs. Smith, whostepped down in 1973, made $42,500 during their last year on thejob. Mrs. Smith now draws $88,715 a year in pension benefits,Reifel $83,589 and Gore $81,347. ...   The best part _ for congressman, not taxpayers _ is that thefederal treasury foots 85 percent of the bill for the congressionalretirement plan.   No wonder House and Senate members have seen the campaign deckis stacked against challengers.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 19   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer on the CDC-AIDS report:   Two of every five adults infected with AIDS are black orHispanic _ far in excess of these groups' proportionalrepresentation in the general population.   That's why, appropriately enough, there is a flap over theCenters for Disease Control's significant little omission in areport the agency made public assessing its performance incombatting AIDS.   The analysts hired by the CDC took it to task for having ``ncohesive plan of action'' for stopping the spread of AIDS amongracial and ethnic minorities.   They said the CDC lacks information about the ``knowledge,attitude and behaviors'' regarding AIDS in minority populations.   And it said the agency has no idea how much of the money itsends to local health agencies for minority AIDS programs actuallyreaches the minorities for whom it was intended.   All of this criticism, however, the CDC saw fit to delete fromthe report. But it left intact an 11-page discussion detailing the$30 million minority AIDS program it administers, according to theAtlanta Constitution.   CDC officials offered the lame excuse that they had merely``condensed'' the report. Unfortunately, the public already is alltoo familiar with this type of ``condensation'' of disturbinginformation unfavorable to government agencies.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
