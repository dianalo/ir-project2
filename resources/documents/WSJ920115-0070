Keenly aware of reregulation threats and new federal rulesthat let more cities cap basic cable rates, cable systemshave simply redefined what &quot;basic&quot; supposedly means. Theyhave carved out a layer of popular channels to form a new&quot;tier&quot; that costs extra -- and thus they effectively dodgethe rules aimed at curbing price increases for basic cable.</LP><TEXT>   The practice of &quot;tiering&quot; wasn't prevalent in late 1989,when Congress first threatened to impose new regulations oncable, just three years after it had largely deregulated theindustry. But tiering had spread to almost 60% of all cablesubscribers by the middle of last year. It is likely toexpand even further this year.   Consumer groups call it a shell game that has let cablecompanies blithely slap on unfair rate increases. In the pastfew months alone, the cable system in Los Angeles imposed a12% increase on its most popular package, and the system herein Manhattan similarly set a 10% increase. Last March, TimeWarner Inc.'s Brooklyn system formed a new tier that includedMTV and CNN; nine months later, it raised the charge for thetier by 34%.   &quot;Cash flow is the name of the game for these companies,&quot;says lawyer Nicholas Miller, who represents several cities indisputes with cable systems. &quot;Their main concern is how do wefrustrate, confuse, divide or slow down an attempt toregulate the rates.&quot;   Almost all of the nation's biggest cable companies now usetiering. They maintain that it more fairly spreads the costsof various channels among the viewers who really want them,that it lets them lower the price of pared-down basic cableand reach viewers who merely want better reception and thelow-income people who otherwise couldn't afford cable.Criticism of tiering &quot;is pure cable-bashing that is totallyunjustified,&quot; says Richard Aurelio, president of TimeWarner's New York cable group.   Many cable operators, however, don't tell customers that acheaper basic option is available. They simply switchcustomers over to the more expensive tiers through a&quot;negative option&quot; that requires subscribers to go out oftheir way to reject the change. In some cases, customers arepenalized for switching to the lower-priced tier by having topay an extra one-time charge.   Only a sliver of cable subscribers on tiered systems --usually well under 10% -- actually buys the redefined narrowbasic service. When federal investigators randomly calledsystems and posed as customers, they found that nine leadingcompanies offering tiers didn't even acknowledge theexistence of the lowest-priced basic tier, according to arecent report from the General Accounting Office. (Calls by areporter to Time Warner systems in Manhattan and Brooklynproduced similar results.)   &quot;The game for cable operators is to tell regulators thatthis is a separate and optional tier,&quot; says Joseph Van Eaton,a cable lawyer for several cities. &quot;But they're tellingsubscribers that expanded tiers are part of basic service.&quot;   Despite cable operators' claims to the contrary, the pricestructure behind tiering often has little basis in reality,in terms of demand for the channels and operators' costs. Forexample, Time Warner's Brooklyn-Queens cable group previouslycharged $20.90 for 58 channels. Last March it split the dialinto 24 channels for basic ($14.95) and a tier of 34 popularchannels for an extra $5.95. Then it tacked on an extra $2.05for the second tier last month, a 34% increase. Yet the tierprobably costs the company only $3.52 to begin with, based onan average monthly cost of 16 cents a channel. (That averagecost comes from Paul Kagan Associates, a media researchconcern; Time Warner's cable group declines to discussspecifics of its channel prices.)   Charging an extra $8 for the tier is &quot;totallyunjustified,&quot; asserts Bill Squadron, who oversees New YorkCity cable systems as the city's telecommunicationscommissioner. &quot;These companies are protecting unbelievablyfavorable market conditions -- no competition and noregulation.&quot; Time Warner's Mr. Aurelio dismisses the chargeas unreasonable.   Just four years ago, cable companies were doing thereverse of tiering. When Congress freed cable from rateregulation by local governments, systems folded all channelsand rates into one basic offering. Then they levied startlingand aggressive price increases. Cable bills shot up 61% fromDecember 1986 to July 1991.   Cable operators said the jump was needed to make up foryears of artificially low rates, when local governments hadrefused to grant adequate fee increases. But a JusticeDepartment report found that only about half of the rate risewas due to higher costs.   As criticism intensified, Congress began weighing newregulation but got nowhere. A bigger threat came from theFederal Communications Commission. In January 1990, the FCCannounced a proposal that would vastly increase the number ofcommunities allowed to ride herd on basic cable rates.   When Congress deregulated cable in 1987, it let a handfulof communities -- those that had fewer than three broadcaststations in their local markets -- continue to regulate localcable rates. The new FCC rule proposed to let towns withfewer than six stations control cable rates, affecting 61% ofall cable systems and covering 34% of all cable subscribersin the U.S.   But the FCC didn't pass the new rule until last July --and by that time tiering had taken hold. The FCC rule alsohad a major loophole: It let local governments control onlybasic rates.   &quot;It tends to make a mockery of the process,&quot; says BillJohnson, deputy chief of the mass-media bureau of the FCC.&quot;It's annoying to the consumer because what they want isn'tregulated by the city.&quot;   The new FCC rule gave Laredo, Texas, new authority tocontrol local cable rates. But in June 1990 the local cablecompany, Paragon Cable, split its single package of 34channels into a basic offering of 11 and a second tier of 23channels. Subscribers who signed up for the expanded basictier had to pay the system $15 each to change to the morelimited basic service.   Three months later, the system raised the price of thesecond tier by 30%, from $5 to $6.50. It tacked another $2increase on one year after that. The end result: In 15 monthsafter Paragon imposed the tiered approach, Laredo subscriberswere paying 21% more for the same 34 channels ($20.50 amonth, compared with $17 when the tier was adopted in June1990).   Paragon, a subsidiary of Kblcom Inc. in Houston, alsolowered the price of its 11-channel basic offering to $7.95 amonth from $12 last July, but only a small number ofsubscribers were affected.   Some cities are trying to fight the cable companies byseeking the right to regulate the extra tier of &quot;expandedbasic.&quot; The city of Gillette, Wyo., is in a court battle withTele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cableoperator.   In December 1989, Tele-Communications retiered itschannels and automatically switched customers to the expandedservice. It also began charging extra for items such asconverter boxes and cable guides. By May 1990, a customerwould have had to pay $22.20 for the same package that hadcost $16.74 five months earlier, a jolting 33% increase.   Outraged, the city passed an ordinance that set the pricefor basic service at $12.80 and set expanded basic at $13.20.TeleCommunications refused to lower the price, and the cityfiled suit. In November, a federal judge ruled that the cityhad the authority to set only &quot;basic rates.&quot; Now Gillette ispursuing a second argument, that TCI's &quot;expanded basic&quot; tierisn't really a distinct and separate product from basicservice. (TCI officials declined to comment on the situationin Gillette.)   Tiering has also triggered resentment among newer cablechannels, which fear a loss of distribution if they areplaced on tiers with pay services.   Bills now in Congress address tiering, but if Congressregulates every level of service, &quot;it will freeze thedevelopment of new programming,&quot; contends Steve Effros,president of the Community Antenna Television Association, acable trade group. He says proposed laws aimed at tiers wouldput artificial price caps on channels. &quot;We are finding ourprice levels now,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
