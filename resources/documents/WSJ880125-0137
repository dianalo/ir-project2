Here, it's called a &quot;clever concept.&quot;    That, at least, is how David Ludtke, restaurateur, describes his Hourglass Tavern, a midtown restaurant where diners are required to eat with hourglasses suspended over their tables. When the sand runs out, the customers have to leave.    This inhospitable rule -- printed on the menu -- is Mr. Ludtke's solution to the problem he faced when the restaurant opened last May: how to serve cheap meals in a tiny space and still turn a profit. The answer, he decided, was quick turnover. So, counting on New Yorkers' penchant for putting up with the ridiculous and calling it fun, he decided on the hourglass gimmick.    So far, most customers have accepted the idea. &quot;At first I felt under the gun, and I really scarfed the salad down,&quot; says Scott Killian, a composer. &quot;But then when the entree arrived, I realized I had plenty of time.&quot; Mr. Killian adds that &quot;in Harrisburg, Pa., where I come from, a restaurant like this wouldn't last two days before the waiter got murdered.&quot;    Fitness consultant Keith Peterson, a regular patron, sees the experience as &quot;a challenge. You agree to participate in an event. You know, when in Rome . . .&quot; His dinner partner, lyricist David Sinkler, says it reminds him of an episode in &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; in which &quot;the wicked witch turns over the hourglass for Dorothy and says, 'This is all the time there is for you, my pretty.'&quot;    Still, Mr. Sinkler says, the time limit isn't a problem because &quot;speed eating is the normal modus operandi in this city.&quot;    That's how Mr. Ludtke feels. &quot;How long does it really take to eat an entree?&quot; he asks. &quot;Ten minutes?&quot; He says most of a meal is really spent not in eating, anyway, but in &quot;excess.&quot; &quot;You nurse a drink, you nurse a menu, you nurse the wine list. We've eliminated all that excess.&quot;    He claims that customers almost always finish within an hour and that waiters are successful in hurrying dawdlers &quot;with a little tap on the hourglass.&quot; But despite his apparent success, he doesn't plan to install timers at his other eatery, a Mexican restaurant called Mike's American Bar and Grill.    &quot;I wouldn't think of it,&quot; he says. &quot;That's more of a drinking restaurant.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
