Information obtained from the plane's black boxes ``showed thatthe flight proceded in a normal manner until a total interruption,which translates as an explosion in flight'' at an altitude of about30,000 feet, said a statement issued by the Transport Ministry.   ``The work of the crew was proceeding normally when the recordingof words and electronic data abruptly stopped,'' the statement said.   It said data from the black boxes backed up the preliminaryfindings of an investigative commission at the site that ``leads usto accept the hypothesis of the presence of explosives on board.''   Workers searching wreckage in the northern African nation ofNiger recovered both the cockpit recorder, which records in-flightconversations by the crew, and the flight data recorder, whichrecords information such as altitude and speed. Both devices arrivedin France late Friday night.   The conclusion drawn from the data signals the start of anintensive search for the individual or group responsible for thebombing of UTA Flight 772, which was flying to Paris fromBrazzaville, Congo, when it crashed Tuesday.   The victims included seven Americans, among them Bonnie Pugh,wife of the U.S. ambassador to Chad, Robert L. Pugh.   In Beirut, a previously unknown group calling itself the SecretChadian Resistance claimed responsibility on Saturday for thebombing.   In a typed a statement sent to Western news agencies, the groupsaid: ``The struggle will continue until the complete withdrawal ofall military colonial forces from Africa.''   France maintains 1,200 soldiers in Chad to help the former Frenchcolony in its 16-year-old war with Libya. But Libya and Chad signedan agreement Aug. 31 putting an end to the conflict.   Responsiblity for the UTA bombing earlier had been claimed by theIran-backed Shiite Moslem group Islamic Jihad.   Islamic Jihad is among several radcal fundamentalist groupsbelieved to be part of Hezbollah, or Party of God, theIranian-supported umbrella group thought to hold 16 Western hostagesin Lebanon.   Callers claiming to represent Islamic Jihad demanded the releaseof Shiite Moslem religious leader Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, who waskidnapped from southern Lebanon on July 28 by Israeli forces. Francehas not been linked to the kidnapping.   However, Ash-Shiraa, a Beirut weekly, recently quoted Islamicmilitants loyal to Iran as charging France with reneging on a 1988deal that resulted in the release of three French hostages held inLebanon. The newspaper said the militants were planning attacks onFrench interests in Africa.   France continues to deny making any deal for the hostages, beyondagreeing to restore diplomatic relations with Iran.   Nevertheless, recurring reports in the French press detail a dealin which France secured release of the hostages by agreeing to freeAnis Naccache, a pro-Iranian Lebanese terrorist serving a lifesentence for attempting to kill former Iranian Prime MinisterShahpour Bakhtiar in France in 1980.   Before the latest claim, an unidentified source at thepresidential Elysee Palace was quoted by the French news agencyAgence France-Presse as saying that the manhunt for the planebombers would be focused on the ``Shiite network'' in Africa.   Police, meanwhile, were examining the plane's passenger list forsuspects, concentrating on nine people who got off in the Chadiancapital, N'Djamena, the plane's last stop before exploding over theTenere Desert in eastern Niger.   Investigators also are loking for clues about the precise natureof the explosive, where it was located on the aircraft and how itgot on board.   Autopies on the bodies of the victims were expected to revealtraces of material or toxic substances that would help answer thesequestions.   A brief statement by the Transport Ministry late Friday nightconfirmed that an investigating commission of officials from France,Niger and Chad had found indications of explosives aboard theflight, but it provided no details until the announcement onSaturday.   The French army, in charge of recovering the victims, flew 200body bags to the site Saturday where paratroopers and militarydoctors have been working in 120-degree heat. The violence of theexplosion and the rapid decomposition of the bodies are expected tomake identification of some victims difficult.   About 100 bodies, already gathered for transport, were to beflown Saturday by helicopter to Agadez, a village in central Niger,and then on to Niamey, the capital, said Col. Jean Job, who issupervising the operation. The rest of the passengers remainscattered across miles of sand.   Among the dead retrieved from the wreckage is the pilot, GeorgesRaveneau, and four other crew members found in the cockpit of theplane and identified by their uniforms, Job said. Workers at thesite said watches on the victims indicate that the explosionoccurred at 2:08 p.m. Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
