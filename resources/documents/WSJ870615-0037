Called a Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit, or Remic, the format was authorized as part of the Tax Act of 1986. For accounting and legal reasons, the Remic is considered by many mortgage experts to be the format that will supplant collateralized mortgage obligations, which are serialized cash flows from pools of mortgages.    Remics have been used to securitize residential mortgages before, but industry experts believe Los Angeles-based Security Pacific's issue represents the first time they have been used to finance a specific commercial property.    Security Pacific's issue involves a first mortgage on the building and land underneath Union Carbide Corp.'s headquarters in Danbury, Conn. The securities are partly backed by a letter of credit from several West German banks and were rated double-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. The complex was purchased by Nevada Investment Holdings Inc., which is controlled by a West German investor, for $340 million.    The eight-year bonds carry a 9.4% interest rate, including the cost of the letter of credit. In an interview, Sidney Bostian, senior vice president of Security Pacific's merchant banking unit, estimated that a mortgage from a traditional source would have carried a 10.75% to 11% interest rate. </TEXT></DOC>
