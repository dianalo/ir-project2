Atkinson Co. of California said it expects an after-tax gain of about $6 million in the third quarter from terminating and replacing an overfunded employee pension plan.    The South San Francisco engineering and construction concern bought annuities to cover its pension liabilities for active employees, and it intends to terminate the current plan. If regulators clear the measure, Atkinson plans to institute a substantially identical replacement plan. The about $38 million in excess assets the move would free up will result in the $6 million gain, Atkinson said.    The company said it expects to take similar action regarding the overfunded benefits plan for employees who retired after a similar settlement in 1986. Atkinson expects &quot;minor&quot; fourth-period after-tax gains from that planned move.    The excess assets will be available to Atkinson late this year or early in 1988, the company said.    In the third quarter of 1986, Atkinson earned $340,000, or four cents a share, on revenue of $245.7 million. </TEXT></DOC>
