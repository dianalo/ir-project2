SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Americans are adopting nearly 50 percent moreforeign babies than they did a decade ago, a private adoption groupsays.   William L. Pierce, president of the National Committee forAdoption, said Monday the increase was not surprising, with as manyas a million American couples unable to have children of their ownand only about 50,000 children available for unrelated domesticadoptions.   But these adoption also show the underlying altruism ofAmericans, Pierce said, noting that many foreign children wereadopted even when more American babies were available.   The rise in foreign adoptions accounted for a large percentageof the overall adoption increase in recent years, he said.   Americans adopted 10,019 foreign babies in 1987, the most recentyear for which Immigration and Naturalization Service statisticswere available. That was a 46 percent increase over 1977 when therewere 6,854 foreign adoptions, Pierce said.   However, Pierce complained that there are children within theUnited States who aren't adopted because of ``a new racism'' byadoption agencies.   These agencies often try to find parents who match the child,both of the same race, or the same mix as the baby's naturalparents. That can result in willing parents being denied a childbecause they are of a different race, he said.   Pierce's comments came as his committee released its ``AdoptionFactbook,'' the second such book it has produced, compilingnational facts and figures on adoptions, adoption laws andregulations and listing sources of information and help.   Other than the INS, the federal government no longer collectsadoption statistics, said Pierce, so his group is seeking to fillthat gap. The committee describes itself as a private organizationthat encourages adoption but takes no stand on abortion.   The first book covered adoptions through 1982, and the newedition brings the figures up to 1986, except for the foreignbabies, which include 1987.   Pierce said that 7,614 of the 1987 foreign adoptions were fromAsia, while only 122 were from Europe. Females were slightly in themajority at 56 percent.   The most common country of origin was South Korea, he said, andthe state where the largest share found new homes was New York.</TEXT></DOC>
