(These are not toll-free numbers).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Single-Employer Pension Plan AmendmentsAct of 1986 (SEPPAA) imposed new restrictions on and rules governing thevoluntary termination of single-employer plans. Under SEPPAA, plans mayvoluntarily terminate only in a standard or distress termination, and then,only if several statutory prerequisites are satisfied. The law also includesseveral detailed requirements mandating the submission to PBGC of the informationnecessary for it to determine whether the requirements for a standard ordistress termination have been met. On April 10, 1986 (at 51 FR 12491),the PBGC issued a Notice of Interim Procedures providing plan administratorswith detailed guidance on complying with these statutory notice requirements.The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 modified some of the substantiverequirements for voluntary plan terminations and, as a consequence, alsomodified the various notice requirements. On January 22, 1988 (53 FR 1904),the PBGC published a notice advising plan administrators of these changes.The information submitted to the PBGC is used by it to make the severalstatutorily mandated determinations it must make relative to a proposedtermination. For both standard and distress terminations, the PBGC mustdetermine whether the statutory requirements therefor have been satisfied.For distress terminations, the PBGC must also determine the level of planfunding.These notices are filed by the plan administrator of a terminating plan.As a rule, plan termination is only initiated once, and therefore thesenotices are typically filed only once per plan. Moreover, the notice requirementsthemselves constitute a relatively minor burden on plan administratorsbecause virtually all of the information/data that must be submitted isinformation or data that must be collected or created in order to carryout the plan termination. The PBGC, therefore, estimates that the aggregateannual burden imposed on plan administrators in filing these notices is4,712 hours. This reflects an assumption, for fiscal year 1989, of 9,000standard terminations and 100 distress terminations.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued at Washington, DC, this 23rd day of June, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Kathleen P.
