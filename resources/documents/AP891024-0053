'</HEAD><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israeli-backed militiamen shot and killed twoarmed guerrillas during a firefight in Israel's self-declared``security zone'' in south Lebanon, military sources said today.   The gunbattle occurred late Monday when a post of the SouthLebanon Army militia came under a barrage of small artillery firenear Kafr Hunah, 15 miles north of the Israeli border, the sourcessaid.   ``SLA soldiers returned fire and a terrorist was killed. No SLAforces were injured,'' said one source on condition of anonymity.   The Israeli army sources said a reconaissance patrol found anAK-47 assault rifle and an explosive charge near one guerrilla'sbody.   The patrol found a second body on a later sweep, the sourcessaid.   They were unable to say if the victims were Palestinian orLebanese. Both Palestinian and Lebanese militias have attackedIsraeli soldiers and their militia allies in the Israeli-controlledzone in south Lebanon.   No organization has claimed responsibility for the attack on theSouth Lebanon Army, which is trained, armed and financed by Israel.   An Israeli army spokesman, who cannot be identified according toregulations, said it is believed more guerrillas took part in theclash but managed to escape. He said no Israeli troops wereinvolved.   Foreign reports have said about 500 Israeli soldiers patrol the2.5-to-12-mile-wide security zone together with the militia forcemade up mostly of Lebanese Christians.   Israel carved out the buffer zone to protect its northern borderagainst attack in June 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its troopsfrom Lebanon after a three-year occupation.</TEXT></DOC>
