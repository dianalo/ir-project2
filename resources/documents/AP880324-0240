MILLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A top opposition leader returned fromexile to a hero's welcome Thursday and said he will join hiscountrymen's struggle which he said has ``but one objective _ toget rid of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.''   The return of Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of the ChristianDemocratic Party, came on the fourth day of a nationwide strikeaimed at Noriega's ouster. The strikers' solidarity seemedunbroken, with Panama at a virtual standstill.   Panama's Roman Catholic archbishop, Marcos G. McGrath,acknowledged meeting with Noriega Thursday morning, but deniedrumors he was trying to mediate the general's departure.   McGrath told an Associated Press reporter when stopped outsidehis home, ``We have met with the general a number of times in thepast few months and we will meet with him again soon.''   Asked if he was acting as go-between for Noriega's exit, McGrathsaid, ``No.''   The church's Episcopal Conference of Bishops met Wednesday,raising opposition hopes that the bishops would demand Noriega'sremoval. But the closed-door session ended with no communique.   There was speculation the bishops remained silent awaiting theoutcome of the McGrath-Noriega meeting Thursday.   A cheering crowd of more than 300 people greeted Arias Calderonat the airport.   Arias Calderon, who is considered a presidential aspirant inelections scheduled for May 1989, told the crowd: ``I am profoundlymoved to be back in my own land. We have but one objective _ to getrid of Noriega and build reconciliation and democracy in Panama.''   He rejected any talks with the government, as suggested thisweek by Noriega's new, hand-picked civilian chief executive, ManuelSolis Palma.   ``Solis Palma is simply a voice, the recent voice for Noriega.He means absolutely nothing for this country,'' Arias Calderon said.   His flight was delayed more than an hour because the Panamanianairline, COPA, at first refused to let him board at San Jose, CostaRica, citing government orders.   Guillermo Cochez, the Christian Democratic Party's vicepresident, called it an ``attempt to intimidate him, to get him toback down. But it was the government that backed down instead.''   With Arias Calderon were five Christian Democratic legislatorsfrom Venezuela, Costa Rica and West Germany to help ensure hissafety. At least 100 journalists covered his arrival.   Despite virtually unanimous support for the general strike bybusiness and industry, Noriega _ head of the 15,000-member DefenseForces and the power behind the civilian government _ remaineddefiant.   He said his foes at home and in the United States don't ``havethe capacity'' to overthrow him.   That feeling appeared to be shared by some strike leaders, whosaid it might take a revolt by fellow officers to remove Noriega asmilitary chief.   ``There are growing pockets within the Defense Forces that areagainst Noriega,'' said Jose Mulino, an attorney and oppositionleader. ``What we don't know is if they will act.''   But in a Wednesday night speech, Noriega claimed the militarywas maintaining ``its high moral and patriotic beliefs'' despite afailed barracks coup last week.   Eleven officers were arrested in that foiled plot. Noriegadismissed more than a dozen officers and shifted the assignments ofother key personnel.   Still, the members of the Defense Forces are due to be paidFriday, and opposition leaders said their loyalty to Noriega couldbe tested anew if they don't get their paychecks.   Panama is out of cash because Washington cut off the supply ofU.S. dollars, the Panamanian national currency, in a bid to driveNoriega into exile. The general was indicted in the United Stateslast month on federal cocaine trafficking charges.   The government was unable to fully meet a $33 million payrollfor 130,000 public employees earlier this month, touching off aseries of strikes and massive demonstrations by workers onceconsidered loyal to Noriega.   The next semi-monthly paychecks for most government employeesare due next week, following the military payday, and they could bestirred to renewed fury if the army gets paid and they don't.   Arias Calderon shared second place on a losing presidentialticket in 1984 and has made himself highly visible in the more thannine months of civic demonstrations and protests against Noriega.   In addition to his party leadership, he is a member of theNational Civic Crusade, a coalition of about 200 business,professional, labor and political groups seeking Noriega's removal.   Arias Calderon was denied entry Feb. 25 when he sought to returnto Panama from a business trip to Miami. That was the day formerPresident Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to dismiss Noriega, but was inturn deposed by the general.   The United States still recognizes Delvalle, who is in hiding inPanama.</TEXT></DOC>
