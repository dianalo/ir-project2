Consider, for example, the 100,000 envelopes Manville ordered for shipping its reorganization plan out for a vote. They proved too puny for the bulky document; after several split in two, stuffers had to divide the package into separate envelopes they bound with rubber bands.    &quot;It's the stupid little thing that will hang you up and drive you nuts,&quot; says Ms. Krawchuk, the 33-year-old Manville attorney who is engineering the building and forest products company's hoped-for exit this fall from court protection after more than six years.    For Ms. Krawchuk, Manville's complex plan for coping with thousands of lawsuits from people who've become sick or died from exposure to asbestos has come to such picayune details. It's a far cry from her main task last year -- the high-level negotiations for the sale of Manville's fortress-like headquarters a half-hour outside Denver. &quot;I've had a real struggle shifting from being a person who's used to doing to a person who gets other people to do it,&quot; says Ms. Krawchuk, who graduated from Ohio State University's law school in 1979 and joined Manville the following year.    If appeals by opponents of Manville's reorganization plan fail, as expected, Ms. Krawchuk and her troops will stuff some 70,000 envelopes with letters telling creditors and asbestos victims that Manville may finally ante up.    They'll sign some 10,000 checks to unsecured creditors, issue 24 million new shares of common stock and thousands of other complex securities -- all within five days. Somehow, it will all tie into Manville's computerized bookkeeping system. If Manville is late in its payments, interest starts racking up, and if the company is really slow, a creditor could declare the company in default.    &quot;I call it 'administrivia,'&quot; says William R. Mansfield, who steered Storage Technology Corp.'s exit from bankruptcy and doesn't wish to repeat the experience.    The job used to be considered cushy. To handle exit details, bankruptcy judges appointed independent agents who usually received a hefty fee -- as much as 0.5% of the money they disbursed. But in the 1970s, companies realized one of their own could do the job for no extra cost, and independent agents were deleted from the 1979 bankruptcy-law reforms.    Ms. Krawchuk, who does legal work for Manville's roofing systems division and helps manage Manville's legal staff, and the rest of her team, must also keep up with their regular workload. Her phone answering machine hints at her 12-hour and 15-hour days, asking callers to &quot;let me know how late I can call you back.&quot;    Ms. Krawchuk doesn't make their jobs easy, co-workers say good-naturedly. &quot;She doesn't take no for an answer,&quot; says Ray Gomez, a public-relations officer, checking his computerized phone-mail machine to find another set of instructions from her.    For a long time, Ms. Krawchuk acknowledges, getting her 35-member transition team in motion was &quot;like moving a rock -- a very large rock.&quot; At Manville's new downtown headquarters, the phone-mail computers are one of her favorite rock-movers. At the old headquarters, she used the &quot;war room&quot; -- a huge conference room lined with some 30 charts that tracked the teams' progress in plain view of passersby, including Manville's top executives. There were gold stars for tasks completed and garish green stripes and neon orange dots for missed deadlines.    As a final motivator, she declared Aug. 1 a trial-run consummation date, forcing everyone to act as if Manville had finally heard from the U.S. Supreme Court that the final appeals by plan foes had failed.    Staffers cut fake checks and even sent trial mailings. They figured out the logistics of notifying news organizations, and they monitored whether all their specially written computer programs would enable auditors to track what they'd done.    They turned up snags: Some ledgers didn't balance, and they discovered they'd miscalculated the record date for the reams of new stock they'll be issuing.    &quot;Things are not happening as smoothly or as on time as we'd like them to,&quot; Ms. Krawchuk said during the trial run. &quot;But that's what the dry run was all about.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
