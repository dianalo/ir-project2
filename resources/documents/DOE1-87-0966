<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-87-0966 </DOCNO><TEXT>Extensive computer simulations have been performed on CMOS and bipolaroperational amplifiers in an attempt to obtain a better understandingof low-level transient radiation response mechanisms. The simulationmethodology has been confirmed using flash X-ray data for the amplifiersstudied. Variations in circuit response to loading and feedback configurationhave been explored, and several generalizations can be made which mayprovide a useful basis for a specification methodology.</TEXT></DOC>
