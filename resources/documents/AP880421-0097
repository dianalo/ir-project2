(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some San Diego police officers arequestioning a former colleague's claim that he was shot and beatenup at his home by three men who intended to kill him.   Doyle F. Wheeler, a former San Diego police lieutenant who oncetestified against a fellow officer in a murder trial, deniedWednesday that he staged the attack. He said he was assaultedbecause he testified last year that another San Diego policeofficer was a racist.   ``I know it had something to do with that,'' Wheeler told theSpokesman-Review newspaper of Spokane.   ``It was absolutely physically impossible for me to do it tomyself. It is impossible to hogtie and shoot yourself,'' he said.   However, some San Diego police oficers cast doubt on Wheeler'sversion of of how his head was grazed by a bullet in an incidentTuesday at his home northwest of Spokane.   Wheeler was treated and released from a Spokane hospital, saidStevens County Sheriff Richard Andres.   Wheeler was described by Assistant San Diego Police Chief BobBurgreen as ``a fellow who is really disturbed.''   ``He (Wheeler) reported that someone tried to kill him, butthere was only a graze wound and powder burn,'' Burgreen told theSan Diego Tribune. ``He was handcuffed, tied up and had to dial 911with his tounge. I find all of this very interesting.''   The incident ``makes no sense,'' said Harry O. Eastus II, apolice officer and director of the San Diego Police OfficersAssociation.   ``Based on (Wheeler's) past performance, there is a stronglikelihood that he could have done that to himself or paid somebodyto do it,'' he said.   Local authorities have refused to release details about theshooting and have declined comment on a possible connection toWheeler's testimony on behalf of Sagon Penn, a black who wasacquitted of murder and attempted murder charges in the 1985shooting of two San Diego police officers.   Wheeler testified that the attack was provoked by the whiteofficers.   Police Agent Thomas Riggs died during the shooting, and policeAgent Donovan Jacobs and a civilian observer, Sarah Pina-Ruiz, werewounded.   Wheeler, who was a member of the San Diego force for about 10years, retired on stress disabilty in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
