The concern, which reports on the credit card industry, confirmed last week that it had received funding from American Express Co. since its newsletter was founded early last year. American Express in March introduced its own credit card, Optima, which is offered to selected holders of its charge card.    As previously reported, The Wall Street Journal, which started publishing the monthly table in January, wasn't informed of the newsletter's ties to American Express until last week.    &quot;The data provided by Bank Credit Card Observer for our monthly tables have been accurate and reliable, but we were troubled by its failure to disclose its ties to American Express,&quot; Paul E. Steiger, a Wall Street Journal deputy managing editor, said yesterday.    John C. Pollock, publisher of the newsletter, said he was &quot;grateful to have had the opportunity to publish our results in the Journal.&quot; Mr. Pollock, who said this week that it was &quot;a mistake&quot; to not disclose &quot;a major source of funding&quot; at the outset, said yesterday that a survey of the newsletter's subscribers had confirmed &quot;their confidence in the reliability and usefulness of the information that we collect.&quot;    The Journal is studying other plans for a monthly credit card table. </TEXT></DOC>
