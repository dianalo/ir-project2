Dale Toussaint.;    The body ofJessica Ann McHenry, a freshman at Granada High School in Livermore, was foundabout 4 p.m. Tuesday along Tesla Road, which runs through rolling grasslandssouth of Livermore.;    Investigators would not release the cause of death orsay if they thought she was killed at the scene or elsewhere. They would notcomment on whether the girl had been killed first and then burned.;    &quot;Therewas a very small amount of evidence at the scene,&quot; said Sgt. Dal Toussaint.&quot;There were not gas cans lying around.&quot;;    Jessica was last seen by schoolfriends early Tuesday afternoon, according to the sheriff's department. Whenshe didn't arrive home after school, her mother reported her to police as apossible runaway.;    Police are searching for a car seen on the road near thebody, but there is no indication that the car is linked to the crime,Toussaint said. Sheriff's deputies were setting up roadblocks Wednesday tosearch for witnesses.;    The circumstances of Jessica's death are similar tothe slaying of a young woman whose burning body was found in Palomares Canyon,between Fremont and Castro Valley, in January. It is not clear if flammableliquid was used to ignite the body in the January case, but a coroner'sinvestigator reported an &quot;odor of diesel fuel&quot; at the scene. She died fromhead injuries from a blunt instrument, the investigator said.;    The womanfound Jan. 27, alongside Palomares Canyon Road, has not been identified,Toussaint said. A coroner's investigator said the woman was 5 feet 6 andweighed 91 pounds. Although no age has been determined, she was described as&quot;young appearing.&quot;;    He said there were no apparent connections between thetwo burned bodies and the slayings of two women whose dismembered bodies werefound recently in the Oakland area.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAN STOBER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910613  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  390  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday June 13, 199100165110,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
