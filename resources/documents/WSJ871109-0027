Terms weren't disclosed. A Robertson Colman spokesman said that &quot;it is fair to assume that National Medical Homecare has annual revenues in excess of $100 million.&quot;    National Medical Homecare provides respiratory products and services, durable medical equipment, and infusion therapy products and services through 145 locations in 40 states. It has more than 2,600 employees.    The sale to NME Holdings Corp., a new company formed by the investor group, is part of a restructuring begun last year by National Medical Enterprises, which has been selling off the bulk of its non-hospital businesses and focusing on its core institutional care operations. As previously reported, National Medical took a $77.1 million write-off related to the restructuring in the fiscal year ended May 31.    Robertson Colman said it has received financing commitments from the Heller Financial Inc. unit of Fuji Bank Ltd., Tokyo, and the Glenfed Capital Corp. unit of Glenfed Inc., Glendale, Calif. </TEXT></DOC>
