The Defense Forces announced in a one-line statement that Maj.Gen. Solomon Dumeni Hawala was appointed army commander, effectiveimmediately.   The position had been vacant since Namibia, formerly South-WestAfrica, became independent on March 21.   An opposition party, the Namibian Patriotic Front, condemnedTuesday's appointment.   Hawala was a fighter in the South-West Africa People'sOrganization, or SWAPO, which waged a 23-year battle forindependence against South Africa.   Hawala, commonly called Jesus Hawala, also has been called theButcher of Lubango, a town in southern Angola where SWAPO had acamp during the war.   People formerly held in SWAPO camps in Angola on suspicion ofbeing spies or dissidents have accused Hawala of supervisingwidespread torture.   The Namibian Society for Human Rights, a private group, accusesSWAPO of failing to account for an estimated 1,500 people detainedduring the war. A U.N. commmission of inquiry last year put thefigure at just over 300.   SWAPO official Theo-Ben Gurirab, who became Namibian foreignminister after independence, acknowledged in August 1989 that somedetainees were tortured, but said all were released.   Under an independence plan, Namibia wrote a constitution andheld democratic elections last year that were won by SWAPO.   SWAPO President Sam Nujoma became Namibia's first president.   Namibia's infant democracy has been widely praised for itsfairness and moves toward reconciliation, but Hawala's appointmentcould reopen old wounds.   The SWAPO Youth League has demanded removal of oppositionmembers of Parliament it accuses of being puppets for South Africa.   SWAPO party leader Moses Garoeb has attacked the DemocraticTurnhalle Alliance, the largest opposition party, as disruptingnational unity.</TEXT></DOC>
