The IRA has used mortars in Northern Ireland.;    Thevan was 100 yards from 10 Downing St., where the prime minister lives andworks.;    Two police officers on duty at the Foreign Office and an employeeof the Cabinet Office were injured by flying glass, police said.;    Policesaid two men were seen running from the van, which caught fire and burnedfuriously on a cordoned-off street just off Whitehall, a busy thoroughfarelined with government offices.;    A spokeswoman for Scotland Yard said themortar landed 40 or 50 feet behind the prime minister's official residence inthe garden, and the explosion &quot;blew out a few windows&quot; at No. 10 and adjoiningbuildings, she said, describing the damage as minor.;    She said the mortarsapparently were fired through a hole in the roof of the van.;    Two women whowere participating in a peace vigil near Downing Street said a piece of themetal landed in the street near them, several hundred feet from where the vanwas parked.;    One of them said there was a series of explosions and the vanburst into flames with black smoke. &quot;A piece of metal came flying past us,&quot;the Press Association news service quoted her as saying.;    The burning vanwas on Horseguards Avenue, near the Old War Office.;    Dr. Andy Ashworth, aformer army doctor who heard the explosions, told the BBC he had been toldthere were bodies in the van, but police said there were none.;    &quot;I heardthree loud explosions sort of consecutively, followed a second later byanother explosion, I mean just loud bangs,&quot; Ashworth said.;    &quot;When I turnedthe corner, I saw a white Ford transit van, its rear doors open, a couple ofsheets hanging out the back of it. But the inside was a burning inferno, justflames completely engulfing the van, and black smoke billowing up.&quot;;   Ashworth, who had served as an army doctor in the Falkland Islands war in1982, said he offered assistance but was told that there were no casualtiesneeding treatment.;    &quot;I certainly wouldn't believe that anyone could get outof that van alive,&quot; he said.;    &quot;There didn't appear to be anybody on thestreet. I got a fairly good view of the street and There didn't seem to beanybody actually right next to the van.&quot; He said it appeared that the van hadbeen on the move, rather than parked.;    If directed at Major, the attackwould be the first on a British prime minister since the IRA bombed the GrandHotel in Brighton on Oct. 12, 1984, during a Conservative Party conference.Five people died but Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher escaped injury.;    Theworst previous terrorist strike in the Whitehall area was a bomb that killedThatcher's ally, lawmaker Airey Neave, in the parking garage of the House ofCommons in 1979.;    The IRA seeks to drive the British out of NorthernIreland and unite the province with the Republic of Ireland.;    There havebeen letter bomb attacks in the past on 10 Downing St. In Nov. 1982, anincendiary package mailed to Thatcher ignited, injuring an office manager.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  London  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910207  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; MAP  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  672  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday February 7, 199100038020,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
