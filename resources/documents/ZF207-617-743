C. Tien, may be a simple, inexpensivesolution to the problem.andM;Previous attempts to facilitate Chinese writing have met with limitedsuccess.andP;  A phonetic spelling system called Pinyin, taught in Chinese schoolssince 1958, uses Roman characters for writing.andP;  But this system has a majordrawback: the language has many homophones, words that sound alike but havedifferent meanings.andP;  Homophones spelled phonetically in Pinyin becomevisually indistinguishable.andM;But Tien's Pinxxiee system spells each word uniquely, regardless of identicalpronunciation.andP;  The software allows users to type in Pinxxiee, see bothPinxxiee and Chinese characters onscreen, and print Chinese and Romancharacters for either Pinxxiee or Pinyin.andM;His program has a 6,500-word Pinxxiee-Chinese dictionary, a compound-worddictionary with more than 50,000 entries, and room for a 200-worduser-defined glossary.andP;  The $295 program was released in the United States inApril.andM;Other packages from the company include PX-Chinese FlashCards, a $29.95program that teaches Chinese root words; PX-TM2, a $695 professionalChinese/English word processor; and PX-TM2+PX 2001, which includes bothpackages for $995.andM;PX 2001 and the other products may be ordered directly from Chinese ComputerCommunications, of Lansing, Michigan, by calling 517-372-4661.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
