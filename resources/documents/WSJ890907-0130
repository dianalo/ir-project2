The launch was originally scheduled for last month, but was delayed by a rocket engine failure.    The breakdown, the first since 1975, was considered an embarrassment for the National Space Development Agency. Japan is behind the other developed countries in space technology, and has been pushing hard to catch up.    A spokeswoman said the agency replaced two engines, and launched the H1 rocket without any problems early yesterday morning. The agency also reported it had received a signal from the satellite. </TEXT></DOC>
