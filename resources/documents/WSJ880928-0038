The problem with things that sound too good to be true is that they usually are.    The legislation would direct all U.S. development assistance toward achieving three goals by the year 2000: a 50% reduction in mortality rates for children under five, a female literacy rate of at least 80%, and a cut in absolute poverty to no more than 20% of each developing country's population. These goals are certainly laudable. But they can be neither attained nor sustained without economic growth -- something on which the legislation is silent.    By proposing to limit U.S. development aid to activities that directly focus on the three goals, the legislation would gut continuing efforts by the Agency for International Development and other U.S. agencies to foster policy reform and economic progress in a wide range of countries. It would turn U.S. foreign aid into a global welfare system.    A bipartisan coalition of 174 co-sponsors in the House and 24 in the Senate has been taken in by the bill's motherhood-and-apple-pie aims. Michael Dukakis recently added his endorsement; George Bush hasn't ventured an opinion yet. The debate is now over-ripe for a dose of sobriety and good sense.    Rather than passing a bill that is no more than a well-meaning statement of intent that addresses three symptoms of economic stagnation, Congress should tackle the causes of poverty by making economic growth through free-market policies the primary goal of U.S. foreign aid. The evidence shows that it is countries with high growth rates that are best able to meet their people's basic human needs and eliminate poverty:   --South Korea now enrolls more than 90% of its children in high school. From 1965 to 1986, while the nation achieved an average annual economic growth rate of 6.7%, it also cut infant mortality by 60%.    --Rwanda, with virtually no economic growth during the period, saw nearly no reduction in infant deaths.    --Japan's infant death rate before World War II was as high as India's today. Japan's rate is now 7% of India's and among the lowest in the world.    --Tanzania, once touted as a socialist success story, has been forced to close schools and clinics in recent years for lack of funds. State domination of agriculture has halved production since 1970.    --China's agricultural liberalization during the 1980s has increased food production by 35% and doubled rural incomes. China can now feed itself.    Indeed, when countries adopt sound economic strategies and begin to grow, the symptoms of underdevelopment on which the legislation focuses start to disappear. The targets the Global Poverty Reduction bill sets for developing countries are reached as soon as economic growth raises average per-capita income to roughly $2,000 a year.    Ignoring such evidence of the need for growth, the bill's targets are naive to the core. For example, they would have all countries achieve in just over a decade the dramatic decrease in infant mortality South Korea produced over 20 years.    Proponents of the legislation insist that it won't increase costs. But while in the current fiscal year the U.S. spent $2.7 billion on development assistance and food aid, officials of the Agency for International Development estimate that meeting the bill's lofty targets would require tens -- possibly hundreds -- of billions of dollars annually.    Whatever the cost, past experience shows that poverty cannot be eradicated simply by sending more money. The U.S. has provided nearly $400 billion in aid to the developing world over the past four decades, with often meager results. Indeed, while Latin America's top 10 debtor governments borrowed $44 billion abroad from 1983 to 1985, their economic policies drove their own citizens to transfer $31 billion out of the region.    While social programs are a necessary component of assistance, the U.S. foreign-aid program should focus first and foremost on growth. Only when U.S. aid aggressively promotes responsible, pro-growth economic policies can America's relatively small amount of assistance bring exponential results. This is the only hope for developing countries to one day provide for themselves what Western aid workers now work so hard to provide.    ---   Ms. Tammen is a research associate with the Heritage Foundation's Center for International Economic Growth. </TEXT></DOC>
