About 5,000 students rallied today at Chosun University in thesoutheastern city of Kwangju to denounce police for the death ofChol-kyu Lee, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.   Some cut their fingers and wrote anti-government slogans inblood.   Lee, a 24-year-old student at Chosun, had served almost twoyears in jail for violating national security laws and was beingsought by police for writing articles praising communist NorthKorea.   His body was found Wednesday in a reservoir near Kwangju, policesaid.   The United National Democratic Movement, the main dissidentalliance, alleged Lee was tortured and killed by policeinvestigators assigned to suppressing dissident groups.   Dissidents and Lee's family claimed the body showed signs ofelectric torture and beatings.   Police denied involvement in Lee's death and officials saidleftists may have killed the student as part of an attempt to coverup anti-government activities. An initial autopsy showed no signsof torture, but it appeared Lee was slain, they said.   Dissident groups charged that a special police unit, the JointInvestigation Team, set up earlier this year to suppress violentanti-government groups, may have been involved in Lee's death.   The unit had announced Wednesday it arrested 234 dissidentssince April 3 for anti-government activity.   The discovery of Lee's body came after six riot troopers werekilled May 3 in a clash with radical students in the southern portof Pusan. The government ordered a major crackdown on violentdissidents after the troopers were killed.   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent anti-governmentprotests and labor strikes in recent months. Police have rounded updozens of suspects as part of efforts to crush dissident groups.   The National Student Council, the main alliance of South Korea'sradical students, charged that Lee was tortured and it demandedthat police officers involved be arrested and punished.   ``We will fight to the end if there is any attempt to cover upor fabricate the truth,'' said council head Lim Chong-suk.   Thousands of riot police were on alert for demonstrations Fridayin the central city of Taejon and in Kwangju on Saturday to markthe anniversary next week of a 1980 anti-government uprising inKwangju in which at least 192 people were killed.   Some dissident and radical student groups have said they willstop violent protests because of the deaths of the riot troopers inPusan. But Lee's death could provoke new unrest, especially ifpolice attempt to block protests.   Radical students and the anti-government dissident groups havelittle support because of their violent tactics and extremepolitical views. The radicals have been calling for the overthrowof Roh and the creation of a leftist state ruled by workers andfarmers.   The government has warned that efforts by radicals to build analliance with workers threatens stability. Strikes have cost theeconomy almost $4 billion in lost production so far this year,officials say.</TEXT></DOC>
