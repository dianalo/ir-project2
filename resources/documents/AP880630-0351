SNIFFEN</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   FBI agents eavesdropped as a Navy procurementofficial read to a private defense consultant the sealed bids from10 companies competing for a $120 million air control contract,court documents disclosed Thursday.   In a 27-page affidavit for a search warrant for theoffice-at-home of consultant Mark C. Saunders in suburban Virginia,FBI agent Joanne T. Burns said court-ordered wiretaps and officebugging devices captured the relay of confidential, insideinformation on nine defense contracts worth a total of more than$522 million.   Another affidavit by FBI agent James B. Lamb spelled out thegrounds for searching the offices of Varian Continental Electronicsof Dallas, one of the firms Saunders dealt with. The Saundersaffidavit was attached to the Varian affidavit.   The affidavits laid out the government's burgeoninginvestigation of defense contract fraud and bribery in greaterdetail than ever since the probe was revealed by coordinatedsearches around the nation June 14.   ``If you can get anything, we ... can make some money,'' thedocuments quoted one consultant as telling Saunders in aconversation monitored by the FBI. The documents contained thefirst publicly disclosed quotes from the government's eavesdropping.   The FBI said, ``There is probable cause to believe that all ofSaunders' business records, dated June 1982 to present, ...constitute evidence of the criminal activities of Mark C.Saunders.''   Saunders is a former Navy procurement officer convicted of andfired for stock trading on insider Navy information in 1982. TheFBI said Saunders was receiving inside contract data from his Navysuccessor, George Stone, and it ``believes that Saunders is payingStone for this information.''   Stone is one of six Pentagon officials transferred to otherduties after their offices were searched.   A phone call to a number the FBI listed as the one at whichSaunders reached Stone was not answered Thursday night.   In all, the documents list the dates and location of wiretappingand electronic bugging in the homes and offices of nine defenseconsultants, including one not previously named. They describe theinitial tip that triggered the investigation in September 1986.   The documents also give a taste of the sums of money involvedfor the consultants, revealing that Saunders and anotherconsultant, Thomas Muldoon, were paid $8,000 a month by Litton, amajor defense contractor, which was just one of at least threecompanies they worked for jointly.   The documents detailed not only the flow of inside contractinformation but also alleged that Saunders, under governmentsubcontract to devise a plan for the Navy to buy radios, conspiredwith Joe Bradley, vice president for marketing of VarianContinental, to rig the purchase requirements so Varian Continentalcould beat other companies in the bidding.   The affidavits were ordered unsealed Thursday by U.S. MagistrateJohn B. Tolle in Dallas. Federal agents requested the documents besealed June 10, saying they did not want to reveal the existence ofcourt-approved wiretaps that were still being used in theinvestigation.   The FBI said the searches were needed to investigate possiblebribery of public officials, conflict of interest, theft ofgovernment property, false statements, mail and wire fraud andconspiracy to defraud the United States.   Varian Continental's parent company, Varian Associates Inc.,headquartered in Palo Alto, Calif., was the 155th largest defensecontractor for 1986, according to the affidavit. The parent companyreceived more than $81.76 million in defense awards that year.   Gary Simpson, spokesman for Varian Associates, said companyofficials have not had an opportunity to review the unsealedaffidavit and would not immediately comment on its specificallegations.   ``Our own internal investigation is continuing and at this pointwe do not believe the company was involved in any criminalmisconduct,'' Simpson said. ``We have been advised that ContinentalElectronics is not a target of the investigation. Mr. Bradley hasbeen placed on administrative leave until our investigation iscomplete.''   Simpson said Bradley's leave was effective Thursday.   A Justice Department spokesman, John Russell, said federalprosecutors in charge of the investigation were ``surprised andshocked'' that the affadavits had been released in Dallas.   ``We didn't know it was being made public,'' said Russell,adding that the department would have no further comment.   The magistrate unsealed the documents because the government hadasked that they remain sealed only until June 30.   The FBI said Saunders regularly acquired information from Stoneand relayed it to Muldoon to give to defense contractors. The FBIsaid it got a court order to tap Saunders' telephones in Virginiain September 1987.   ``Saunders speaks with Muldoon almost daily and provides himwith information and documents relating to various governmentcontracts,'' the FBI said. ``In return, Muldoon pays Saundersone-half of the money which Muldoon receives from the contractorswho pay Muldoon for the information provided by Saunders.''   The FBI said Saunders told Muldoon that ``he (Saunders) ispaying a lot in expenses to get information on specific programs.It is believed these payments are to Stone because the statementsmade by Saunders to Muldoon were in regard to programs (about)which Stone passed information to Saunders.''   The Marine Corps and the Navy Space and Naval Warfare Command,where Stone is director of information management services andinformation transfer purchase division, are taking bids on anAdvanced Tactical Air Command Control system, which the FBI saidmay be worth $120 million. Initial proposals were submitted inAugust 1987.   On Sept. 30, 1987, the FBI intercepted a conversation atSaunders' home between Stone and Saunders. The FBI said:   ``Stone provided Saunders with the following figures from eachof the competitors' proposals: SAIC - 53.4; E-Systems - 88.8; GE-90.8; Ford -132.1; Comptek - 137.1; LTV - 138.9; Grumman - 140.3;Unisys - 143.0; UTC (Norden) - 144.4; and Litton - 198.7. It isbelieved these numbers refer to millions of dollars.   ``It is not known exactly what the figures represented, but itis known that the figures were not supposed to be given out andthat the lower its figure, the better off a company was in thecompetition,'' the FBI said.   ``Saunders in turn told Muldoon over the telephone the relativepositions of the companies for which Muldoon was working orconsidering working,'' the FBI said.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
