(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   American and Japaneseentrepreneurs are making deals in the desolate Soviet Far East, bestknown to outsiders as the area where border gunners shot down aKorean Airlines jumbo jet.   Most foreign investment in the resource-rich, lightly populatedregion is still in the startup stage.   Moscow sees foreign trade and foreign investment as ways to boostthe Soviet economy, although so far no large-scale foreign projectshave been started in the Soviet sector of the booming Pacific Basin.   Nonetheless, enthusiasm abounds on both sides when the ideasmesh, and a small projects are envisioned for ventures ranging fromsportfishing to seafood canning to volcano tours.   ``The key factor is the (Soviet) desire to do business, and it'sthere in spades,'' W.K. Nichoson said after signing a preliminarypact to go into business with the district government in YuzhnoSakhalinsk, capital of the island of Sakhalin and the remote KurilIslands.   Nichoson, originally from Long Island, N.Y., but a longtimeresident of Japan, accompanied a group of Tokyo-based journalists ona recent Soviet-arranged tour to Sakhalin, previously off limits toforeigners.   Sakhalin became a household name worldwide six years ago, whenthe Soviets shot down a KAL 747 en route from the United States toSouth Korea. All 269 people aboard died in an incident thataggravated East-West tensions.   Sakhalin also was an area Nichosen knew 35 years ago. Then he wasan electronics officer in the U.S. Air Force flying reconnaissancemissions from Japan and dodging Soviet fighters based on Sakhalin,he said.   He has been in business in Japan since leaving the military, andstarted his own company, Asia Dynamics (Japan) Ltd., in 1969.   ``I've been selling things in Tokyo for 30 years, and I'm tiredof selling things in Tokyo,'' said Nichoson, 58, explaining why hewas exploring this new frontier.   The initial business Nichosen foresees is small _ processinglocal wild berries for a health drink and canning high-qualityseafood, both for export. He is pledging $500,000 to be half thecapital of a joint-stock company, with local Soviet governmententerprises putting up the rest in rubles.   But further down the line, he said, there were possibilities intourism, plywood, dairy products and other exportable goods, and theventure would need ``very large sums from Wall Street investmentbankers.''   The Soviet Far East is terra incognita now to Wall Street, butsince President Mikhail Gorbachev put the region on the perestroikacourse of economic restructuring, business tours have been tricklingthrough.   Problems abound: the ruble isn't convertible to foreign currency;it is hard to repatriate profits; roads, telephones and hotels arepoor; Soviet products often don't meet export standards.   Worst of all, the Soviets are new to business. But the Soviet FarEast has such rich resources _ fish, forests, minerals, oil, coal _that a growing number of foriegn businessmen are exploring forprofitable opportunities.   Some Japanese firms have embarked on deals, even though Tokyodoes not want economic relations to expand before the resolution ofthe dispute over Kuril islands captured by Soviet troops in the lastdays of World War II.   Japan insists on the return of the islands, Moscow refuses, andthe issue lies like a tall barricade between big Japanese investorsand the Soviet desire to join the economic boom now enjoyed by manycountries in the Far East.   Nonetheless, small Japanese-Soviet operations include twofish-farming joint ventures on Sakhalin, the southern half of whichwas owned by Japan until 1945. A Japanese company is taking a 30percent interest in a project to refurbish a hotel in YuzhnoSakhalinsk and participate in management.   Yoichi Okada is running a Japanese restaurant as a joint venturewith a Soviet enterprise in the Sakhalin port of Holmsk and saysit's already profitable.   The Kuchiro restaurant, in a nicely trimmed building with a giantred lantern outside, stands out in drab Holmsk like a peacock in apiggery. It draws 300 customers a day, Okada said.   A problem, he said, is how to take out his side's 49 percent ofthe profits and convert them to Japanese yen. ``There are ways to doit, maybe buy fish or go into further enterprises to export fish toJapan,'' Okada said.   Perestroika seems to have unleashed a torrent of ``new Sovietbusinessmen'' on Sakhalin with sometimes eccentric ideas requiringforeign money, ties or technology. A geologist wanted to organizetours of the island's volcanoes. An electronics specialist wanted todeal in computer technology.   Ilya Sukharev, a local television producer, is organizing acooperative to export art. He said permission came in only threemonths. ``I never imagined it could be done in such a short time,''he said. ``It was a miracle.''   Two Sakhalin journalists, Vladimir Ardunov and Grigory Kireev,said their young company is embarking on a deal to develop a resorton an island in Vietnam and wants foreign expertise.   One way to exploit the area's bountiful fish is with rod andreel, preferrably wielded by a hard-currency-spending foreignanglers. To find out how to please them, the Soviets invited FishingThe West, of Milwaukie, Ore., to Sakhalin to try the rivers and giveadvice.   Kerry E. Brown of the company said the salmon fishing had beengreat, but accommodations and roads were poor. ``The Russians wantto do it right, but they've got a long way to go,'' he said.
