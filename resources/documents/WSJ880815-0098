Illicit commerce in wildlife tends to increase during the summer and Christmas holiday seasons, because customs officials often are overloaded and the shipments slip past them, Jean-Patrick Le Duc told a news conference last week.    Mr. Le Duc is an enforcement official for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which aims to prevent international trade from threatening species with extinction.    The convention, in force since 1975, has been ratified by 95 countries, including the U.S., most Latin American countries except Mexico, and many Asian, African and European nations.    Signatories are supposed to enforce bans on commercial trade in an agreed list of endangered species and to regulate trade in others that might become endangered.    Endangered species on the list include all apes, the giant panda, many South American monkeys, the Asian elephant, all rhinoceroses, many birds of prey and parrots, all sea turtles, some crocodiles and great whales. Permits aren't issued for international trade in these species except under unusual circumstances.    Mr. Le Duc said many people think that live animals make good Christmas presents. In Europe, for example, parrots and reptiles including baby crocodiles are increasingly popular pets.    He said total trade, legal and illegal, in wildlife amounts to $5 billion annually. He estimated that illegal trade is about 30% of the total.    The hot spots of illicit wildlife trade are Southeast Asia, Japan, Latin America and Africa, though &quot;Africa is doing more than any other developing country&quot; to try to control it, Mr. Le Duc said.    But he said a trader could buy a gray parrot in Ghana for about $10 and resell it for about $600 in North America. </TEXT></DOC>
