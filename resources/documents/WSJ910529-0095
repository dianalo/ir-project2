The project, still in the early planning stages, has anestimated value of $4.3 billion.</LP><TEXT>   Japanese companies involved in the project include NipponMining Co., Arabian Oil Co. and Nippon Oil Co., which isexpected to hold the largest stake of the three companies.   Saudi Aramco, the Saudi national oil company, representsthe kingdom's interests and is expected to control 50% of theproject.   In addition, Caltex Group, a joint venture of ChevronCorp. and Texaco Inc., may also participate in the projectthrough Nippon Petroleum Refining Co., which Chevron andTexaco jointly own with Nippon Oil.   The plan calls for building a 300,000-barrel-a-dayrefinery in the Saudi city of Jubail, a Persian Gulf portwhere Saudi Arabia and Royal Dutch/Shell Group now operate arefinery that processes 250,000 to 300,000 barrels a day.   A final site for the Japanese refinery hasn't been chosen,but a mothballed 43,000-barrel-a-day facility in Yamaguchiprefecture, owned by Nippon Petroleum, has been suggested.   The Saudi-Japan plan is expected to sharply reduceJapanese demand for petroleum products from other sources. Asa result, many Asian oil refineries now in the planning stagecould be scrapped or reconfigured if Japanese productsimports are expected to shrink.   Few foreign oil companies have refining and marketingoperations in Japan, the developed world's second-largest oilconsumer. The Saudi involvement marks the first entry intoJapan by a Mideast oil producer. Earlier this year, SaudiArabia acquired a minority interest in Ssangyong Oil RefiningCo. of South Korea.   Construction of the facilities, which is expected to takeup to two years, could begin as early as next year.   Financing for the project must still be worked out. Of thethree Japanese companies, only Nippon Oil is thought to havesignificant cash reserves. But the Japanese government may beexpected to assist the group. The government recentlyinitiated a program of low-interest loans to Japanese oilrefiners for upgrading existing refineries.   Officials at the Ministry of International Trade andIndustry have for more than two years lobbied for companiesto build their ties to oil-producing nations.   Saudi officials were said to be treating the venture as agovernment-to-government agreement, according to officialsfamiliar with Saudi policy. But Japanese officials maintainthe project is private.</TEXT></DOC>
