But administration officials won't embrace the plan publicly for fear of alienating their allies on Capitol Hill.    Mr. Rostenkowski's plan, unveiled earlier this week, would remove from taxation that part of a gain that is attributable to inflation. As an alternative, it would also offer a special tax break on assets held for five years, and a more generous break on assets held for 10 years.    The plan would reduce the effective tax rate to as little as 14% for some high-return, venture capital investments -- even less than the 15% rate originally proposed by President Bush. &quot;It's a very powerful incentive,&quot; one administration official said.    In addition, the proposal would encourage investors to hold on to their assets for five or 10 years, a goal favored by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.    Mr. Rostenkowski's plan has won few plaudits from the advocates of a capital gains tax-cut in Congress. &quot;There are a lot of objections to it,&quot; Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, senior GOP member of the Ways and Means Committee, said this week. But the administration's enthusiastic response suggests that the Rostenkowski plan might be the starting point of a compromise that could win House approval.    Mr. Archer is one of 13 Republicans and six Democrats on the committee -- a majority of the panel -- who are backing a plan proposed by Rep. Edgar Jenkins (D., Ga.). That plan would cut the top tax rate on capital gains to 19.6% for 2 1/2 years. Afterward, the rate would rise to 28%, and the gain attributable to inflation wouldn't be taxed. Currently capital gains are taxed at the ordinary income rate, which can be as high as 33%.    President Bush has publicly backed the Jenkins plan, and administration officials say they will continue to work with Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Archer and their other allies in Congress. &quot;They stood by us,&quot; one administration official said. &quot;Now we want to stand by them.&quot;    Moreover, administration officials say they have no reason yet to believe the Rostenkowski plan will win over House Speaker Thomas Foley or other Democratic opponents of a capital gains tax cut.    But in private, several administration officials acknowledged yesterday that they prefer Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal to Mr. Jenkins's. They say it does more to encourage entrepreneurial investment and it provides a greater incentive to invest for the long term. Budget Director Richard Darman and Treasury Secretary Brady met with the Ways and Means chairman on several occasions while the Illinois Democrat was fashioning his proposal, and it apparently was designed, in part, to meet their concerns.    One reason some members of Congress don't like the Rostenkowski plan is because it applies only to assets purchased after the law takes effect. For timber investors, for instance, Mr. Rostenkowski's tax break would apply only to trees planted in the future. Mr. Jenkins's proposal would apply to any asset sold in the next 2 1/2 years.    But administration policy makers point out that if the purpose of the capital gains tax break is to encourage investment, there's no point in giving it to investments that have already been made. The Rostenkowski plan, they note, would give the tax break only for new investments.    The debate over capital gains is being driven in part by revenue concerns. According to Joint Tax Committee estimates, the Jenkins proposal would raise $2.5 billion in revenue next year by encouraging people to sell their assets and pay taxes at the lower rate. The Rostenkowski plan would bring in only $1.18 billion.    But over the next five years, the Jenkins plan would result in a revenue loss of $1.9 billion, the committee said, while the Rostenkowski plan would lose only $136 million.    Mr. Rostenkowski's plan would allow investors who had held an asset for five years to choose, instead of inflation indexing, to pay tax on only 75% of the sales price of the investment. For assets held 10 years or more, the investor could choose to pay tax on only 50% of the sales price.    For venture capital investments and other investments that earn large returns, the value of that alternative is considerable. The effective tax rate on an asset earning a 40% annual rate of return and held for 10 years, for instance, would be only 15%, according to calculations by Robert McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice. </TEXT></DOC>
