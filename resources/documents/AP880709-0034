Postmaster General Anthony Frank said on Friday that managershave found enough savings in other areas to re-open windows Sept.10 to ``the same level of service that existed prior to Feb. 13.''   Frank said local managers will have the discretion to decidewhat changes are best for their community. For example, in someareas evening hours may be expanded, while in others an extra clerkmay be put on at busy times instead of having longer hours withfewer clerks.   The cuts in window service, one step to trim spending by $160million, amounted to about half a day a week, and in many areasthat meant closing offices on Saturdays.   Other communities had their post offices closed one morning orone afternoon a week.   The changes drew considerable criticism, particularly since theyoccurred just before an increase in postal rates.   Frank has struggled in his four months in office to explain thatthe rate hike was initiated more than a year ago because of growingdeficits, while the service cuts were required when Congressordered a sudden reduction in postal spending.   In a related development later Friday, the Postal Serviceannounced it was suspending all work on a controversial contractwith Texas computer billionaire H. Ross Perot, who was studyingways to improve the agency's efficiency.   Under terms of the deal with Perot, the initial $500,000 phaseof the work was to be followed by a second phase in which paymentwould be based on a percentage of any savings realized by thePostal Service. That apparently open-ended deal has generatedcontroversy.   At least two competitors of Perot complained to the GeneralServices Administration's Board of Contract Appeals, which orderedthe pact suspended. The Postal Service, however, has argued thatboard has no jurisdiction over its activities.   The Postal Service said late Friday it believed its contractwith Perot was a ``valuable and innovative approach'' to makingoperations more efficient, but that it suspended the contractbecause of GSA board's order.   The dispute probably will have to be settled in federal court.</TEXT></DOC>
