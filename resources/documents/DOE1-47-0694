Ideas do have consequences, he argues, andwe ignore the connection between Marxist ideology and practice at ourperil. The Soviets still adhere to Lenin's adaptation of the German militarytheorist Karl Von Clausewitz's dictum that war is a continuation of politicsby the addition of other means. Lenin reversed the dictum: politics isa continuation of war by other means. In times of war as well as in timesof peace, the Soviet Union operates on a war footing. Thus, Marxist-Leninistregimes throughout the world are great garrison states. Also, they areexpansionist states which constantly seek to spread their ideology toother countries, particularly to Third World nations.</TEXT></DOC>
