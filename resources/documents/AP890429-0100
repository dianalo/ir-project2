Concerned Shrimpers, which Mialjevich said represents 2,000shrimpers from North Carolina to Texas, was formed to fight theturtle excluder devices, commonly called TEDs.   U.S. District Judge Patrick Carr held a rare telephone hearingFriday afternoon after Louisiana Attorney General William Gusteasked for a temporary restraining order blocking the requirement.Carr said he would rule Monday.   Already, shrimp fishermen have won a 60-day reprieve from heftyfines that were to go into effect Monday for boats that aren'tequipped with the TEDs, to free endangered sea turtles entangled intheir trawls.   Last week, under congressional pressure not to strictly enforcethe special net requirements, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbachersaid he was ordering the Coast Guard to issue only warnings throughJune 30 _ instead of fines of up to $10,000 _ to violators alongthe Gulf and Atlantic coasts.   Environmentalists maintain that the TEDs will help save theendangered Kemp's ridley sea turtle from extinction, andMosbacher's decision drew criticism from a federal biologist.   ``The shrimpers think that the sky's going to open up and Godwill save them again,'' said Jack Woody, national sea turtlecoordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ``In this case,God is the secretary of commerce. I'm totally frustrated at thispoint.''   Shrimpers disclaim responsibility for most of the 11,000 turtledeaths estimated by the National Oceanographic and AtmosphericAdministration each year.   ``In 21 years of shrimping I've caught six Kemp's ridley seaturtles and they all went right back into the water alive,''Mialjevich said.   ``I don't know of but about a dozen shrimpers that have TEDs,''Ted Shepard, director of the 400 member Louisiana ShrimpersAssociation, said Saturday. ``I don't think most of them will towthem. They're having a hard enough time making a living now.''   TEDs fit into the mouth of shrimp trawls and have trap doorsthat let turtles escape.   Fishermen maintain the devices are dangerous to pull and clogeasily, are expensive and reduce their harvests. The contention isdisputed by researchers who say fishermen who learn to use devicescorrectly show no signs of loss. The ones based off Louisiana alsoargue that the endangered turtles are not found in the waters wherethey fish.   ``This is an unbelievable horror story. There's just no way thisshould be placed on the Gulf fishermen,'' Shepard said. ``You don'tget the Kemp's turtles in the areas we shrimp in. They're in theAtlantic and off the coast of Florida.''   Shrimpers have proposed alternatives, Mialjevich said, includinga $25 fee on shrimping licenses each year dedicated to hatching andgrowing the turtles.   The two-month delay in enforcement approved by Mosbacher comesat the beginning of the sea turtle nesting season when thousands ofthe seagoing creatures come ashore to dig their nests on sandybeaches across the Southeast.   Previous studies have shown that more than 11,000 sea turtlesdrown in shrimp nets each year in the United States, incuding about3,000 in the Gulf of Mexico.   ``We don't need to wait for another study to find out if they'reendangered,'' Woody said. ``They can call me and I'll tell them forfree. I've been putting little turtles in the ocean for 12 yearsand watching them disappear.''</TEXT></DOC>
