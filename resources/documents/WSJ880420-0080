Officials of National Business and of Hees International Corp., a Toronto management and investment concern, disclosed the debt figure along with revised financial statements, which show National Business with a loss of 33.8 million dollars for the year ended Sept. 30, as opposed to previously reported net income of 14.2 million dollars, or 85 cents a share.    The maker of plastic transaction cards said the adjustments were due to &quot;misrepresentations&quot; including 32.2 million dollars of &quot;fictitious sales&quot; previously reported. The revised statements show fiscal 1987 sales of 162.6 million dollars, as opposed to 189.6 million dollars initially reported.    National Business said it plans to renegotiate terms of the debt, most of which is owed to a group of U.S. insurance concerns who hold senior notes of the company.    Hees released basic details of the proposed recapitalization plan. Hees was hired in January after two of National Business' senior officers resigned and the company's board said it found &quot;unauthorized&quot; securities transfers.    Hees' plan calls for the sale of certain National Business assets, a rights offering to current holders, private or public equity offerings, and restructuring of debt, with some debt converted to equity.    Tim Casgrain, a Hees managing partner named president and chief executive officer of National Business in January, said he is &quot;optimistic&quot; that the proposed recapitalization plan will win approval from lenders and National Business holders. Representatives of the note holders couldn't be reached. A meeting with them is scheduled for next week.    National Business said Hees would underwrite any proposed equity offering. Willard L'Heureux, a Hees managing partner, said the investment concern would retain a minority holding in National Business only. It will ensure credit is available to National Business to cover payments to trade creditors, he added.    Mr. Casgrain said National Business shareholders are expected to vote on the plan at the company's annual meeting in June or July. The plan is subject to regulatory approval.    National Business said the revisions also affect 1986 results, and its financial statements for that year were withdrawn. Revised numbers aren't yet available.    Trading in National Business was halted prior to the opening yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It closed Monday at 3.40 dollars, up five cents.    Messrs. Casgrain and L'Heureux wouldn't estimate the proceeds from proposed equity offerings or asset sales.    Hees said National Business' NBS Transaction Services Inc. unit is the most likely asset to be sold, and Mr. L'Heureux said &quot;about 100&quot; parties have shown interest in buying it. A Toronto investment dealer has been retained to auction the company, Hees said. Mr. Casgrain said &quot;a few&quot; of the same parties, which include North American and foreign investors, have shown interest in acquiring a controlling stake in National Business. </TEXT></DOC>
