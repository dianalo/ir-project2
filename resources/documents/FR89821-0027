Due consideration has been given to the commentsreceived.There were a total of 38 commenters, representing manufacturers, airlines,crew unions, consumer advocates, and foreign airworthiness authorities.Some commenters stated that not enough technical/research data is availableeither to substantiate that an unsafe condition exists or to determinea consummate design modification to address the unsafe condition, and suggestedthat the proposal be withdrawn. The FAA disagrees. As explained in theNotice, the FAA conducted an in-depth review of existing regulations, policies,and procedures pertaining to the certification of large main deck ClassB cargo compartments with volumes exceeding 200 cu. ft. This review revealedthat, notwithstanding compliance with the existing regulations, airplanesequipped with main deck Class B cargo compartments do not provide an acceptablelevel of safety in terms of smoke and fire protection, for the followingreasons:1. The existing rules, policies, and procedures being applied to the certificationof Class B cargo or baggage compartments in terms of smoke and fire protection,are inadequate.2. While entry into the cargo compartment is available, not all cargo isaccessible.3. It is unlikely that personnel would have the means available to extinguisha fire (particularly a deep-seated fire).4. The quantity of fire extinguishing agent and the number of portableextinguishers are inadequate.5. The level of visibility available in a smoke filled cargo compartmentis not adequate for locating and fighting a fire with a portable fire extinguisher6. Most existing transport airplane smoke or fire detection systems werecertified prior to FAR 25 Amendment 25-54 and are incapable of giving timelywarning.7. Current designs do not provide adequate means to monitor conditionsin the cargo compartment after fire warning and firefighting procedureshave been implemented.8. Cargo compartment lining does not provide adequate fire containment.9. Current designs do not provide a means to shut off ventilation air intothe cargo compartment to limit oxygen to the fire.In addition to that study, data available from full-scale fire tests atthe FAA Technical Center reveals the rapid exponential growth of cargofires and the quick loss of visibility in the compartment. Past testingin Class C, D, and E compartments indicates that, without a fire suppressionsystem, ``cargo fires can easily reach dangerous proportions in any sizecompartment.'' (Reference 1) It was also concluded that ``fire in largeloaded cargo compartments may be expected to result in a flash fire shortlyafter detection and the shutoff of ventilation air.'' (Reference 2) Testingutilizing smoke detection systems similar to those presently used in newerClass B compartments led to the conclusion that ``the smoke detection systemdid not always give early warning of fire and subsequently gave false warningsof fire and subsequently gave false indications of the level of smoke inthe compartment.'' (Reference 3) Although a shorter detection time couldincrease the time available for fire fighting, all the referenced FAA studiesindicate that a flash fire could occur in as little as 2 to 3 minutes afterignition of standard type cargo packing material in cardboard boxes. Itwas concluded from testing in References 3 and 4 studies that a Halon 1301suppression system could effectively suppress and control a cargo fireas long as the initial concentration was in excess of 5 percent and atleast a 3 percent concentration was maintained.<ITAG tagnum="84">References</ITAG><T3>Reference 1</T3>_Blake, D.R. and Hill, R.G., <T3>Fire Containment Characteristics of Aircraft Class D Cargo Compartments,</T3>FAA Technical Report No. DOT/FAA/82-156, March 1983.<T3>Reference 2_</T3>Gassmann, Julius J., <T3>Characteristics of Fire in Large Cargo Aircraft (Phase 11). </T3>FAARD-70-42, September 1970.<T3>Reference 3</T3>_Blake, David R., <T3>Suppression and Control of Class C Cargo Compartment Fires, </T3>DOT/FAA/CT-84/21,February 1985.<T3>Reference 4</T3>_Gassmann, Julius J. and Hill, Richard G., <T3>Fire Extinguishing Methods for New Passenger/Cargo Aircraft,</T3> FAA-RD-71-68,November 1971.)In light of the considerable amount of data and information available,the FAA has determined that an unsafe condition exists with regard to ClassB cargo compartments, and considers this AD action a positive step in addressingthe unsafe condition posed by fire in Class B cargo compartments.Some commenters contend that the proposed AD would be inflexible, ineffective,or inappropriate, and that the means of dealing with the described safetydeficiency would be more appropriate as a change to FAR part 25 or FARpart 121. The FAA disagrees with these comments. FAR part 39 provides forthe issuance of airworthiness directives when an unsafe condition existsin a product and is likely to exist or develop in other products of thesame type design. As discussed in the Notice, the FAA has determined thatan unsafe condition exists with regard to fire hazards in the Class B cargocompartment. The proposal was prompted by information from a specific accident,a Boeing Model 747 ``Combi'' airplane operating with a main deck ClassB cargo compartment, as defined by FAR 25.857(b), that was lost over theIndian Ocean on November 28, 1987. Although no formal findings have beenissued by the foreign authority having jurisdiction over the accident investigation,there is firm evidence that an inflight fire occurred in a Class B cargocompartment, which contributed to the loss of the airplane.Some commenters suggested that the Class C compartment was not as goodas a Class B because a Class B compartment can be accessed by an individualto identify and evaluate the fire situation. Further, this method preventsadverse action being taken in the event there is a smoke alarm failureinstead of a fire. The FAA acknowledges that for the false warning situation,where there is no fire, the Class B cargo compartment has an advantageover the Class C. Verification that there is a fire, or that the fire isextinguished is not an option with the Class C compartment. It is generallyassumed for a Class C cargo compartment that a fire warning constitutesa fire, the compartment is flooded with Halon, and the airplane is landedat the nearest suitable airport. If there is no fire then it is only acase of inconvenience, lost time, and fuel, but safety is not adverselyaffected. When there is a fire in a cargo compartment, which is the criticalsituation as opposed to the false warning condition, optimum safety withintechnological limits has been provided by the Class C cargo compartment.That is not the case with the Class B cargo compartment. Simulated firetests have shown that the smoke detection systems and the compartment linermaterials may not be adequate to contain the fire until it can be reachedby a fire fighter with extinguishing agent. Further, the fire fighter maynot be able to locate the fire to extinguish it because of the presenceof smoke and obstructing cargo.Over the years, the size of Class B cargo compartments and the size ofcargo packages has increased, making timely fire detection, fire locationidentification, and manual fire suppression much more complicated, difficult,and ineffective. In Class C cargo compartments, cargo is not accessibleby a fire fighter; therefore, the equipment is equipped with cargo linersfor containment, control of ventilation and drafts, and fire detectionand suppression systems to control or extinguish the fire. There are noknown cases of loss of aircraft due to fire in Class C cargo compartments.Several commenters agreed with the intent of the rule, but opposed theproposed requirements. In general, these commenters pointed out significanttechnical difficulties with converting in-service airplanes with ClassB cargo compartments to Class C cargo compartments. There are significantdesign considerations, since most Class B compartments are designed foreasy and quick conversion for carriage of passengers or cargo on shortnotice. Therefore, to maintain the proper fire extinguishing agent concentration,major changes would be necessary not only to provide compartment ventilationand air exhaust, but also to provide protection against rapid decompression.The commenters stated that conversion to a Class C cargo compartment wouldprobably prevent them from having the needed flexibility of rapid compartmentsize changes to support certain customer requirements. These commenterssuggested that there were other alternate actions and/or modificationsto the Class B compartment that were appropriate safety improvements andmore easily accomplished. The following were suggested as areas of improvements:1. Reducing the detection time to 1 minute.2. Providing a means to ``knock down'' fire, plus a method to stop directflow of ventilation system air into the compartment.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>``Knock down'' is a term often used to refer to a processthat occurs when a sufficient concentration level of extinguishing agentis present at the fire to reduce it to a non-threatening level.</ITAG>3. Improving the firefighting training.4. Providing an improved smoke ``barrier.''5. Providing public address (PA) speakers in the compartment.6. Providing improved lighting in the compartment.7. Reviewing the ``access'' to cargo within the compartment.8. Installing viewing ports in access doors to the compartment for monitoringcompartment conditions.As stated in the preamble to the Notice, the FAA recognized that otheralternative design changes may be developed which would provide a levelof safety equivalent to the options proposed in the Notice. Therefore,as a result of these concerns raised by the commenters, the high cost ofretrofit of Class C cargo compartments, and the jeopardy to certain highlydesirable cargo operations, the FAA has evaluated the suggested alternativedesign features and concurs in part with the commenters. In regards tothe suggestions listed above, the FAA has determined that the followingdesign changes and procedures are appropriate to achieve major fire safetyimprovements for Class B cargo compartments:1. Provide a smoke or fire detection system that meets FAR 25.858 (Amdt.25-54), FAR 25.1309, and also provide an aural and visual warning to thestation assigned to individuals trained to fight cargo fires.2. Requiring a compartment fire extinguishing system that provides an extinguishantconcentration to ``knock down'' a fire and suppress it, allowing time fora trained individual to find and extinguish a fire, or to verify that thefire is extinguished; and provide a means to shut off ventilation systemair inflow to the compartment from the flight deck.3. Requiring individuals trained to fight cargo fires.4. Provide a cargo compartment liner that meets FAR 25.855 (Amdt. 25-60).5. Provide two-way communication means between the flight deck, the stationassigned to the trained individual, and the interior of the cargo compartment.6. Provide improved illumination within the cargo compartment.7. Requiring cargo loading envelopes and limitations to provide accessto all the cargo for fighting a fire.8. Provide a cargo compartment temperature indication system to the flightdeck and designated station.In addition to the above items, the FAA has determined that the followingfeatures are necessary to ensure that an acceptable level of safety isattained:1. Additional portable fire extinguishers appropriately located for usein the compartment and a means to effectively discharge portable fire extinguishersinto each container or into each pallet that is covered. This will providesufficient extinguishing agent and will ensure a means to properly usethat agent in containers or covered pallets.2. Protective garments and protective breathing equipment for individualsfighting a cargo fire. This will provide protection for the individualassigned to control a cargo compartment fire.3. Fire thermal protective covers for cockpit voice and flight data recorders,windows, safety devices, wiring, flight controls (unless it can be shownthat a fire could not result in jamming or loss of affected control systems),and other equipment necessary for safe flight and landing that is locatedwithin the compartment. This is necessary to ensure that items which arenot critical for continued safe flight, but are essential for the overallsafe operation of the airplane, are not damaged in the event of a cargocompartment fire.Accordingly, the final rule has been revised to include the accomplishmentof the design changes and procedures specified above as an alternate methodof compliance with the rule. The FAA has determined that if these itemsare incorporated, they will adequately address the unsafe condition. Thisalternative action is a logical outgrowth of the proposal and is responsiveto the commenters.Several commenters stated that discontinued use of pallets for cargo isnot practical and would result in serious adverse economic consequencesto the operators and to very remote communities that heavily rely uponthe Combi service. Other commenters stated that cargo loads are often transferredfrom one airplane size to another of different size. In addition, cargoloads are transferred from airline to airline creating compatibility, logistic,and airworthiness control problems for cargo containers that have a detectionand extinguisher system and meet the flame resistant liner requirements.It is not the FAA's intent to deny the use of pallets in ``Combi'' aircraft.The issue is the fire control and containment capability with cargo loadedon pallets. With the present practice, in which the cargo is loaded onpallets, a deep-seated fire could develop and result in the compartmentbeing filled with dense smoke. By revising the final rule, as describedabove, the FAA has addressed these concerns by requiring a means to dischargeportable extinguishers into covered pallets, improved access, lighting,and protective equipment for the individual fighting the fire.Numerous commenters indicated that the 180-day compliance time is unrealistic.After further consideration, the FAA concurs. The FAA has determined thatcertain of the equipment and operational changes described above (includingthe formulation and implementation of a training program for fighting cargocompartment fires) can be reasonably accomplished within one year afterthe effective date of the final rule and will provide an acceptable levelof safety as an interim measure. In addition, the FAA has determined thatthe originally proposed alternatives or the remaining design changes describedabove can be reasonably accomplished within three years after the effectivedate and will provide an acceptable level of safety thereafter.Several commenters provided cost estimates, based on discussions with airplanemanufacturers, that indicate the cost of converting a Class B cargo compartmentto a Class C cargo compartment would be approximately $2,500,000 for awide body airplane and about $1,000,000 for a standard body. The FAA agreesthat these cost estimates are reasonable, and has revised the economicimpact analysis paragraph below, to incorporate these figures.After careful review of the available data, including the comments notedabove, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest requireadoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA hasdetermined that these changes will neither increase the economic burdenon any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.There are approximately 278 Boeing Model 707, 727, 737, and 747 seriesairplanes and 124 McDonnell Douglas Model DC-8, DC-9, and DC-10 seriesairplanes of the affected desitificated to operate with a Class B maindeck cargo compartment. Many of these airplanes have been permanently operatedin the all-passenger configuration and are, therefore, not affected bythis proposal. Approximately 40 of these airplanes are presently operatedby U.S. operators in the mixed cargo/passenger configuration. Based onthe estimated cost of conversion submitted by several commenters, $1,000,000per standard body airplane and $2,500,000 per wide body airplane, the costsassociated with incorporating additional design features, enhanced protectivesystems and equipment, and fire control procedures for the Class B cargocompartment are estimated to be $800,000 per standard body airplane and$2,200,000 per wide body airplane. (These estimated figures are based onthe fact that these changes require less redesign than is required forconversion to a Class C compartment.)Because this final rule contains a significant alternative to the proposedrequirements, interested persons are invited to submit such written data,views, or arguments as they may desire regarding this AD. Communicationsshould identify the docket number and be submitted to the Federal AviationAdministration, Northwest Mountain Region, Transport Airplane Directorate,ANM-103, Attention: Airworthiness Rules Docket No. 88-NM-80-AD, 17900 PacificHighway South, C-68966, Seattle, Washington 98168. All communications receivedby the deadline date indicated above will be considered by the Administrator,and the AD may be changed in light of the comments received.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is nota ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positiveor negative, on a substantial number of small entities, under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
