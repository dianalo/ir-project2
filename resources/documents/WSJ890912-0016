Companies budgeting merit increases for 1990 plan to lift executive salaries 5.8% from this year's level, the same as in 1989, consultant Mercer Meidinger Hansen finds. Another consultant, Sibson andamp; Co., puts the expected boost for executives and officers at 5.7%, off slightly from the 5.9% awarded this year. By both surveys, however, executives will fare better than most workers. For all employees, Mercer sees an increase of 5.5%, up from this year's 5.4%; Sibson comes up with an unchanged 5.4% boost.    Increasingly, though, more companies establish variable pay programs to reward top performers throughout corporate ranks. Sibson says 46% of the companies it surveyed now award pay-for-performance increases to employees below the executive level; a further 7% plan to introduce such programs by the end of 1990.    With inflation near 5%, most workers face &quot;yet another year of treading water,&quot; consultant Towers Perrin says.    THE SUREST ROUTE to the top seems no clearer now than it ever was.    Is finance, marketing, engineering or law the best path to the chief executive's chair? Daryl Renschler, a physicist who is CEO of SL Industries, sees &quot;the pendulum on the side of financial and legal expertise now.&quot; But Mike Hawkins, a National Semiconductor Corp. vice president, says a technical company needs technical talent at the helm. And Barbara Franklin, a director of several companies, says more firms look for executives who have &quot;managed something that's not in the U.S.&quot;    Management Practice Inc., a consultant, says 23% of the CEOs appointed at major companies last year were technical specialists; finance people got only 14% of the jobs. Companies, though, clearly look beyond resumes. Cyprus Minerals Co. shifts several top managers to test their potential as CEOs. The chief financial officer, for one, now heads coal and iron-ore operations. &quot;How well he handles that will be key to whether he is selected,&quot; says Kenneth Barr, who retires as CEO next year.    SUMMER'S END brings massive changing of the guard in temporary help.    September school bells signal the return to classes of high school and college students who took jobs this summer. But the tolling bells also mean that parents of elementary school youngsters are free to resume work. Manpower Inc., a temporary-help agency that counted 40,000 students among its 120,000 temps this summer, signs up 40,000 young parents to pick up where the students left off. &quot;It's the essence of job sharing,&quot; says Mitchell Fromstein, Manpower's president.    Aetna Life andamp; Casualty says 200 of its 1,600 temporary employees in Hartford, Conn., were students who are being replaced mostly by mothers with young children. But Frank Liguori, Olsten Corp. president, says parents are only part of the ever-changing inventory of available workers. &quot;There is a big pool out there,&quot; he says.    Another switch comes with the Christmas break when college kids seek jobs and parents want to stay home.    EXECUTIVE DENIAL: Fully 35% of the executives who flunked cardiac stress tests given this year by the Life Extension Institute haven't followed up with recommended visits to cardiologists or otherwise modified their behavior, the institute says.    ONE IN THREE companies rearranged working hours this summer to give workers longer weekends or other flexibility, the American Society for Personnel Administration finds. Most did it to boost morale; 34% say it also increased productivity.    SUGGESTION BOX ideas from employees saved companies $2.2 billion last year, up 10% from 1987, the National Association of Suggestion Systems says. For their inspiration, the workers won $160 million.    EMPLOYERS SHOULD be required to provide health insurance to all full-time employees, eight of 10 Americans believe, according to a Gallup poll for the Employee Benefit Research Institute.    WANDERING AROUND draws raves as a management tool. But don't force it. &quot;You can't find out much sitting in an office,&quot; says Dresser Industries' CEO John Murphy. Going into the field brings contact with lower-rung workers &quot;more willing to tell it as it is,&quot; he says. At Mattel Inc., &quot;there's a creative synergy when I move around,&quot; says Diana Troup, a senior vice president. William Donovan, Gillette Co.'s personnel director, says his traveling &quot;isn't aimless, I'm not looking over shoulders.&quot;    Lynnette King, a senior vice president of CalFed Inc.'s California Federal Bank, says wandering taught her that it took computers at some branches excessively long to prepare a report. She got the computers reprogrammed. But Michael Conway, America West Airlines president, warns some managers &quot;can wander and never accomplish a thing.&quot; Workers, he says, see through executives who aren't sincere.    Consultant Peter Grazier says the wandering should include contact with customers as well as workers.    THE CHECKOFF: One-track minds: An investment banker off to visit his family in Washington state jests he plans a takeover offer for Mount Rainier and will spin off some trails to finance the deal. . . . Why bother? Nearly half the resumes sent to prospective employers receive less than a minute's attention, Transition Team, an outplacement firm, says. </TEXT></DOC>
