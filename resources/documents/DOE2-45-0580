The results of a recent relativisticBethe-Brueckner-Goldstone calculation are taken as 'data'. Fits in awindow of normal nuclear densities are extrapolated to large densitiesand compared with the 'data'. We find large discrepancies which hintat an insufficiency of the model in its present parametrisation.</TEXT></DOC>
