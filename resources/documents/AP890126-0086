Danny Wall, chairman of the bank board, told theHouse Budget Committee.   The bank board last year spent $38 billion to close insolventinstitutions or merge them with healthier partners.   Wall estimated that insolvent savings and loans are losing $2.5billion a year. The bank board has estimated it would cost $45billion to $50 billion to clean up the industry. Private estimatesrun to $100 billion or more.   Wall said the bank board will provide an updated cost estimate,possibly next week.   He said to ``permit weak institutions to continue todeteriorate...would ultimately increase the cost of resolution.''   Rep. Leon E. Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the committee, said``this crisis is a major economic and budgetary threat. It threatensthe future of the housing finance system.''   The committee session came one day after the Bush administrationfloated a trial balloon suggesting that depositors pay to resolvethe savings and loan problem. Congress wasted little time sticking apin into the balloon.   Bush's Treasury secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, said Wednesday hisstaff is looking into a variety of revenue-raising options,including a proposal to charge depositors in banks, Sandamp;Ls and creditunions a 25-cent fee for every $100 in their accounts.   Bush, in an interview, stressed that he hasn't made anydecisions, but he said, ``That is one option.''   The trial balloon stirred a furor on Capitol Hill where Rep.Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., predicted, ``It's going to be blown out ofthe water.'' Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, said through an aide, ``Thereis not a member of the (banking) committee who would vote for it.''   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp. which insures commerical banks, said Wednesday that he opposesany plan that would stick banks with the cost of the Sandamp;L cleanup.   ``In general we have said it is unfair to have the banking systempay for the errors of the Sandamp;L industry, but we have alwaysrecognized that it's a possibility,'' he said.   Last year, federal regulators pledged more than $38 billion toclose 205 insolvent Sandamp;Ls. More than 350 other insolvent institutionsremain open and billions of dollars more will be required.   The Washington Post reported today that a forthcomingcongressional study will criticize some of the nation's largestaccounting firms for failing to uncover fraud and mismanagement atSandamp;Ls.   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,found that a dozen failed Sandamp;Ls were given ``clean audits'' _ meaningno problems were found _ shortly before they went under, thenewspaper said.   So far, no single proposal for bailing out the industry hasgained widespread support.   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a senior member of the House BankingCommittee, said the administration's decision to float the depositfee plan ``underscores how bad all the alternatives are.''   ``The nature of the solutions is they are going to beuncomfortable. ... Our choices are potentially increasing taxes,potentially increasing the budget deficit or some sort of depositinsurance premium increase,'' he said.   One option under Treasury scrutiny is a user fee paid by mortgageborrowers. Other choices involve various ways to borrow the money,either on or off budget, with the Treasury paying the interest.   A variation strongly opposed by Sandamp;L lobby groups calls for theTreasury to issue bonds whose principal would be covered by theindustry-owned, regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Only the annualinterest payments by the Treasury would count toward the budgetdeficit.   Others say putting all of the Sandamp;L spending on-budget would be thecheapest alternative in the long run, but that would greatlycomplicate the Bush administration's efforts to bring the 1990budget deficit under the $100 billion Gramm-Rudman limit.   Rep. Willis D. Gradison Jr., R-Ohio, a member of the budgetpanel, advocates putting Sandamp;L spending on-budget, but exempting itfrom the Gramm-Rudman limits. He argues that Sandamp;Ls costs alreadyexist as a federal liability and therefore shouldn't count as newspending.   Meanwhile, White House chief of staff John Sununu maintained thata deposit insurance fee is not a tax and wouldn't violate Bush's``Read my lips: no new taxes'' pledge. Sununu called it ``anadjustment upward of the current premium structure.''</TEXT></DOC>
