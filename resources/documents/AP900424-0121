Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.   The measure:   _Authorizes loans, purchases and payments by the AgricultureDepartment to help the wool and mohair industry.   _Sets a payment rate that would be the difference between thenational average of all domestic wool receipts and the price thegovernment predetermined that producers should get. Each producer'spayment from the government would be calculated by applying thisrate to net proceeds for wool sold the preceding year.   The honey section of the farm bill also would be little changedfrom current policies.   The price support for honey has dropped an average 5 percenteach year for five years. Under the new legislation, support priceswould be frozen at 56.86 cents a pound through 1995.   Loan repayment rates would be unchanged.</TEXT></DOC>
