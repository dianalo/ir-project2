 &quot;I don't know what the t-tests mean,&quot; headmitted.andP;  A journalist and investigative reporter, he is studying campaignspending in the 1988 congressional elections at the Center of ResponsiblePolitics in Washington.andP;  He uses the Data Desk statistical package fromOdesta Corp., which, he said, makes it possible to &quot;digest and look forpatterns in huge amounts of data without doing a formal proof.&quot;andM;Data Desk uses the visually oriented exploratory data approach to statisticalanalysis developed by Paul Tukey, a statistics professor at PrincetonUniversity in New Jersey.andP;  The technique of exploratory data analysis worksby animating a 3-D scatter plot.andP;  The patterns revealed by rotating the x, yand z axes help you determine what statistics to run.andM;&quot;It lets you approach data the way a detective approaches the scene of thecrime -- without preconceived answers,&quot; said Paul Velleman, developer of DataDesk and professor of statistics at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.andM;In traditional statistics, you formulate hypotheses, collect data and conducttests to confirm the original hypothesis.andP;  &quot;This is certainly a validapproach, but often there is [existing] data sitting around, like marketing,sales or election data,&quot; said Velleman.andP;  &quot;Data Desk lets you approach itinquisitively rather than judgmentally.andP;  It lets tha data speak to you.&quot;andO;Data Desk includes a large set of statistical procedures so that you canexplore and verify your observations in an iterative fashion.andM;MacSpin rom D2 Software was the first program to bring Tukey's exploratorydata techniques to the Mac.andP;  MacSpin can add color and shading to createcontours, but it doesn't do the actual statistics.andP;  Jim Gardner, anoceanographer with the U.S.andP;  Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Cali., keepsdata from a study of surface sediment collected in the Mediterranen Sea in anExcel database.andP;  By exporting and charting the data with MacSpin, Gardner can&quot;see [statistical] relationships between elements or differentiate distinctpopulations of [chemical] elements.&quot;andM;Scatter and rotate.andP;  Neither Exstatix nor Fastat, the newest statisticalanalysis programs for the Mac, use exploratory data analysis.andP;  But both addrotating 3-D scatter plots as one of their chart types.andM;Exstatix users appreciated its friendly user interface and attractive graphs.andO;&quot;The 3-D graphs are teriffic, and the company is extremely responsive,&quot; saidMakinson.andP;  &quot;But it takes me 20 minutes to load my data.andP;  I can't wait thatlong each time I use the program.&quot;andM;Daryl Scott, president of Exstatix's developer Select Micro Systems (SMS),said that despite the program's slowness, &quot;it produces the most commonstatistics instantaneously.andP;  It uses what we call &quot;think-ahed processing.'andO;While you think, it calculates.&quot;andM;Multiple charts and tables can be combined in a single Exstatix Layout windowto create reports.andP;  With other programs, this information must be exported toa word processing or desktop publishing program to be combined on a singlepage.andM;Exstatix is also extendable by writing external routines in Pascal or C aswell as links to SMS's Map-Maker package.andP;  This extends the capabilities ofthe program beyond the standard statistics package.andM;Systat/Fastat.andP;  Systat comes from Fastat Inc., a leading developer ofstatistical software for mini-and microcomputers.andP;  Fastat is a scaled-downversion of the original, with a vastly improved user interface.andP;  WhereasSystat is a professional-strength program, Fastat is easy to use.andM;Johan Joseph, a member of the advanced development group of Arthur Andersenin Chicago, bought Fastat at Macworld Expo in January, where it was firstintroduced.andP;  &quot;I got all the statistics I wanted and was surprised at how easyand fast it was to use,&quot; he said.andM;Joseph look for the bottlenecks in computer systems through simulation andneeded a package that could do curve fitting in 3-D plots.andP;  &quot;I can create aquadratic curved surface plot, examine and manipulate the surface separatelyfrom the plot, and even export it to a word processor.&quot;andM;&quot;Systat is bigger and more comprehensive than anything else on the Mac,&quot; saidDavid Brant, a statistician and technical writer at ACIUS Development Corp.andO;While it has a more powerful programming language, unique multivariateanalyses to work on groups of data and an extensive graphing facility with aseparate 900-page manual, &quot;it's still a command-line language, which isunpalatable to many Mac users,&quot; said Brant.andP;  &quot;Without a stat background, youwouldn't know what to do with it.&quot;andM;StatView.andP;  StatView, the first general-purpose and most popular statisticsprogram for the Mac, is available in four different versions from twocompanies.andP;  StatView, which came out on the 128-Kbyte Mac, and StatView 512+,with additional statistics and graphing, are sold by BrainPower Inc.andO;StatView II, which requires a math coprocessor, and StatView SE + Graphics,which is identical to 512+ but with added graphics, are sold by AbacusConcepts, the original developer.andM;StatView is comparable to Exstatix and Fastat in power and the scope of thestatistics included.andP;  However, it uses the single window interface developedfor the original program, making complex analysis awkward.andM;&quot;StatView's strongest point is that it's fast and it's easy to put togetheranalysis,&quot; said Sherwin Stefan, president of Brain Power.andP;  &quot;It's self-evidenthow to use the program.&quot;andP;  StatView is also the only program that allows fullediting of labels on charts.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
