An independent Lagos newspaper said at least three people died inMonday's rioting at Sokoto, 465 miles north of the capital, in Kanoprovince. The Guardian Express quoted no source and did notelaborate.   State-run Radio Nigeria mentioned no casualties and did notestimate damage, which was inflicted a day after the provincialmilitary governor approved the appointment of Ibrahim Dasuki asSultan of Kano.   Reporters in Lagos said people believed the military forced thecommittee of Moslem elders that selected the new sultan to chooseDasuki instead of the elder son of the late sultan Sadiq Abubakar.   As sultan, Dasuki leads Nigeria's Moslems, nearly half the peopleof black Africa's most powerful and populous nation. He is reveredby Moslems of neighboring West African states and he wieldspolitical power as the sultan is consulted by Nigerian leaders ofall denominations.   Abubakar was sultan for 50 years until he died last week. Dasukiis a 56-year-old former civil servant.   State radio said tension started building Friday in Sokoto, apredominately Moslem town, after local state-owned Rima Radioannounced that Muhammadu Maccido, Abubaker's elder son, had beenappointed successor.   Police arrested the station's general manager and four employeesafter the announcement. Rima Radio later reported the nine-memberselection committee of Moslem elders, called kingmakers, had not yetdecided.   Anticipating trouble when the true announcement was made,authorities deployed police to strategic buildings and into thestreets.   But Radio Nigeria said they fled when they saw the crowd ofthousands, who set fire to the radio station building beforemarching on Sokoto Prison and freeing all the inmates.   Rioters set alight the administrative block of the HealthMinistry and the local branch of the Luxembourg-based Bank of Creditand Commerce International. Dasuki is chairman of the bank's localboard.   There also was a power failure, but it was not immediately clearif it was connected with the rioting.   Troops were called in and, together with police, twice repulseddemonstrators' attempts to storm the sultan's palace. Radio Nigeriasaid frustrated rioters then blocked streets with burning tires andbillboards and damaged several public and private vehicles.   Security forces managed to get most rioters to disperse by Mondayafternoon, though sporadic disturbances continued around the palaceand Sokoto's main market, the radio said.</TEXT></DOC>
