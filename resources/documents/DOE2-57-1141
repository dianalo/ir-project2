Bacterionema matruchotii proteolipid wasincubated with a radiolabeled H+-channel inhibitor, 14C-dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide,and binding characterized by displacement studies with DCCD or ethyldimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide.A carboxyl binding site was suggested by displacement of DCCD by thenucleophile, glycine ethyl ester. The displacement studies indicatedthat proteolipid bound DCCD via carboxyl group interaction in a hydrophobicregion of the protein. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showedthat all label was associated with a single band of 8500 Mr. No non-specificbinding of 14C-DCCD to phospholipids occurred, since all bound labelwas associated with protein following Sephadex LH-20 chromatography ofcrude proteolipid. Phospholipid liposomes were prepared containing bacteriorhodopsinand proteolipid or proteolipid-14C-DCCD, via cholate dialysis. TransmembranepH changes established by the bacteriorhodopsin H+ pump were measuredin the presence and absence of added proteolipid. Proteolipid had aneffect similar to those of uncouplers such as tetraphenylboron. Boththe rate and extent of proton translocation increased following additionof proteolipid to BR-liposomes. 14C-DCCD abolished the proteolipid-augmentedion transport. When tetraphenylboron was used to abolish the transmembraneelectrical potential, calcifiable proteolipid did not augment protontransport.</TEXT></DOC>
