Over the weekend, my governor, a Republican lawyer and farmer named Terry Branstad, signed a bill that makes Iowa the first state in the land where it's a crime for anyone in a video shop to tell anyone else what films are being rented by you or me or Judge Bork. So now my friend Rich Eychaner, who runs Movies to Go here, will face jail and a fine if he tells you how many times I've checked out &quot;Casablanca&quot; in the past year.    Coincidentally, just a few days before that, one of my senators, Chuck Grassley, joined with three colleagues to introduce the Video and Library Privacy and Protection Act, which lets patrons sue any video shop or library that discloses customer records. So if that bill passes, and surely it will, I'll be able to sue Rich for thousands of dollars -- plus punitive damages -- if he tells you that I've almost worn out a copy of &quot;Top Hat.&quot;    Just about everyone is for these bills. In Iowa, the bill passed in the Senate by a 47-to-1 vote and in the House by 90 to 1. The U.S. Senate bill is sponsored by Mr. Grassley and Wyoming's Alan Simpson, two Republicans who are just this side of the wacko right, and Paul Simon and Patrick Leahy, Democrats who are just this side of the bizarre left.    The American Civil Liberties Union and the American Library Association and the Video Software Dealers of America all are lined up behind the Grassley bill. In Maryland, where a bill similar to Iowa's awaits the signature of the governor, the lower house approved 130 to 2 and the upper house 37 to 0.    It seems to me that any time a bill passes with margins like those in Iowa and Maryland or is backed by such diverse sponsors as Chuck Grassley and Paul Simon, the bill bears an extra-careful look. And if you take an extra-careful look at the Iowa and Maryland and U.S. bills you'll find that they're pretty awful.    Pretty awful because:   First, they're not needed. The problem they deal with doesn't exist.    Second, remedies already exist should the problem arise.    Third, they'll lead to some terrible court confrontations over freedom that will be needless and damaging.    Fourth, they'll spur legislators of all stripe to propose laws mandating more and more secrecy in this open society.    Let's take these one at a time.    The problem doesn't exist. During the confirmation hearings of Judge Robert Bork, a scrappy Washington publication called City Paper somehow got a look at the records of a video shop he patronized and disclosed that he liked Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock movies. It was an innocuous, isolated case. People are hard pressed to find other examples.    But it was a big deal to some. &quot;This unwarranted peek into Judge Bork's personal life was a grim reminder of just how elusive a concept personal privacy can be,&quot; Sen. Grassley intoned from the right. Over on the left, the American Civil Liberties Union was officially &quot;appalled.&quot;    The unstated concern, clearly, is this: What if he had been renting dirty movies? Well, what if. &quot;Protecting a person from a neighbor's raised eyebrow isn't exactly fit subject matter for legislation,&quot; Herb Strentz, a Drake University professor and executive secretary of the Iowa Freedom of Information Council, said in a letter to Sen. Grassley.    Indeed, should a problem arise, better remedies exist. The first is: If you rent from a video shop that has loose-lipped employees, go elsewhere. There are 30,000 video stores in America. The big ones, like Washington's Erol's, have policies prohibiting employees from discussing a customer's selections. If disclosure of records became a problem, the marketplace would solve it. Stores would change their procedures and advertise that they don't even keep records after the film is returned. (And, for that matter, why should they? Why not just hit the computer's delete button when I return &quot;Top Hat?&quot;)    A legal remedy exists, too. People can, and do, sue for unwarranted disclosure of private, embarrassing facts. That's one aspect of the tort called invasion of privacy, a tort invented 100 years ago and pretty well established by now. So if Rich Eychaner tells The Wall Street Journal that I'm crazy about the movie &quot;High Society,&quot; and if that hurts my feelings, I already can sue Mr. Eychaner and The Journal. (He did tell me that Gov. Branstad occasionally rents movies at Movies to Go. &quot;Trust me, it's not very interesting stuff,&quot; he said. &quot;Didn't you just break the law?&quot; I asked. &quot;Oops,&quot; he said.)    But these new bills set up some ugly confrontations. Assume that a video-store clerk tells me that you're a werewolf-movie freak. Assume that I print it in the Daily Tribune here. Then you sue the store under the Iowa or proposed U.S. law. The store owner says he didn't disclose the information. So your lawyer subpoenas me. I refuse to say who gave me the information. I'm held in contempt and jailed.    Whose side will you be on on that one? I asked Mark Lambert, legislative coordinator of the Iowa Civil Liberties Union, a strong backer of the Iowa law. &quot;Yours,&quot; he said. Well, thanks. But that's an issue that wouldn't come up under existing remedies -- remedies of the marketplace or the courts -- and it's a Constitutional confrontation the nation doesn't need.    So why did the Iowa civil liberties group support the bill? &quot;I guess I would argue that there's some information that shouldn't be getable,&quot; Mr. Lambert says. &quot;Everyone would draw the line somewhat differently. Obviously, we draw the line that video rental is one area where people should have protection.&quot;    But others will indeed draw it elsewhere. What about bookstores? Will we soon have a law making it a crime for a bookseller to let slip what books I bought? What about movie theaters? Should we have a law forbidding a ticket-taker from mentioning who went to what at Cinema 42 last night? How about lingerie sellers? Surely we need legislation to protect us from having some blabbermouth tell his drinking buddies what kinds of silks and satins we buy. How about magazine stands and drugstores?    This is not idle speculation. The Grassley bill &quot;is a precedent to build on,&quot; the ACLU says approvingly.    &quot;The tar pit becomes stickier and stickier,&quot; says Prof. Strentz.    Should we go a step further? What about controlling the speech of not just the owner or clerk but also of the person standing next to you in line at the video store or the drug counter? What if that person goes and tells someone that he saw you buying birth-control pills or renting chainsaw movies? What about the customer at the liquor store who tells his neighbor about all that cheap wine you bought yesterday? Shouldn't we fine or jail that person, too?    All of that, of course, is ridiculous. You can't outlaw gossip.    Yet talk of what movies you or I or Judge Bork rents is just gossip, and nothing more. And any attempt to regulate that gossip would be ridiculous, too -- if it weren't actually happening.    ---   Mr. Gartner is editor and co-owner of the Daily Dispatch in Ames, Iowa. </TEXT></DOC>
