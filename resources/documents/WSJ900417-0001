The high court agreed to hear an appeal by NewJersey-based Ingersoll-Rand Co. The company was sued by PerryMcClendon, a former salesman of its construction equipment,who was hired in 1972 and fired in 1982, four months beforehe would have been vested in the company's pension program.</LP><TEXT>   The case presents the important question of whetheremployees may sue for damages under state law for so-calledwrongful discharge related to pension benefits, or whethersuch lawsuits may only be filed under federal law, withreparation limited to reinstating the pension benefits thatwere lost.   That question is part of a larger legal debate overwhether states may limit the right of employers to fireworkers who were hired for indefinite periods and aren't partof union contracts. Many states have adopted an&quot;employment-at-will&quot; approach, meaning an individual works atthe will of the employer and may be fired at any time,without being given a reason.   But, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce NationalLitigation Center, 39 states have allowed individuals to suefor damages on the ground that their dismissal violatedpublic policy. &quot;Thousands of such claims have been filedacross the country,&quot; the Chamber said in afriend-of-the-court brief. Dismissal to avoid paying pensionbenefits is one example of a firing that would violate publicpolicy.   The Chamber and other business groups argue that whenwrongful discharge lawsuits involve pension benefits, statelaws must give way to a federal law, the Employee RetirementIncome Security Act. The federal law prohibits firing workersto interfere with their pension benefits and limits suchlawsuits to federal court.   Mr. McClendon sued Ingersoll-Rand in state court in Texas,arguing that he was improperly fired to keep him fromreceiving pension benefits. Ingersoll-Rand, after the lawsuitwas filed, allowed Mr. McClendon to become vested in thepension program, but he continued the lawsuit, hoping tocollect damages for the company's &quot;bad faith conduct.&quot; ATexas trial court dismissed the lawsuit prior to a trial.   But the Texas Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, that firingworkers &quot;primarily&quot; to avoid paying pension benefits violatespublic policy and justifies allowing lawsuits for damagesunder state law. The Texas high court said that such alawsuit isn't barred by federal pension law. The Texas courtordered a trial in the case.   Yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear thecompany's appeal, to be argued in the fall.

(Clayton vs. Place)   -- Stayed a California state court order that wouldrequire the sale of four Hare Krishna temples in the U.S. tosatisfy a verdict against the religious group of more than $5million including punitive damages and interest. The verdictwas for a mother who alleged that her 14-year-old daughterwas held against her will by members of the group in 1974 and1975. The stay is in effect until the high court decideswhether to hear the Hare Krishnas' appeal, which challengesthe constitutionality of the damage award.
