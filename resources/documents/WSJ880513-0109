Exact terms of the contract weren't disclosed, but the two companies said the value of the work to Textron would be $700 million through 1995 if 600 aircraft were sold. Airbus, a pan-European consortium of which British Aerospace is a part, so far has orders, options and other commitments for 145 of the two planes, the A-330 and the A-340.    The risk for losses in the wing work, possible if more aircraft aren't sold, will be shared between the two companies under terms that weren't disclosed. British Aerospace has been shopping for subcontractors for its Airbus work because it lacks capital resources to do all the work on its own, and has gotten less financing than it requested from the British government.    Analysts said the deal represented a marriage of interests between British Aerospace and Textron, an aerospace, financial services and consumer products concern. The Airbus group has strived in the past to keep as much work as possible in Europe, but needs outside investment. Textron is apparently willing to take a risk on the project because it is winding down production of wing structures for two big U.S. Air Force projects and is hungry for new work.    Textron will invest $14 million initially, and more over the life of the contract. A spokesman for the company declined to say how much would be spent, or how the risk will be shared between the two companies.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Textron shares closed at $24.50, down 12.5 cents.    The U.S. has been involved in a longstanding trade dispute with the Airbus Industrie consortium over the state subsidies that the groups' partners receive. The U.S. government has argued these subsidies enable planes to be sold at unfairly low prices. The consortium already has several large U.S. subcontractors.    British Aerospace said that Textron's work on the wing structure represents 15% of all of the A-330 and A-340 work that British Aerospace is responsible for. British Aerospace will design the wing parts. A number of other subcontracts have yet to be placed.    John Simon, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles, said the consortium faces a tough battle selling the wide-body A-330 and A-340 against the U.S. competition, which includes Boeing Co.'s 747 and 767-300 planes, and McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s MD-11.    Mr. Simon said the main opportunity for sales will be over by 1990, when many airlines will have completed planned replacement of aging fleets. </TEXT></DOC>
