Meanwhile in New York, the U.N. Security Council, assembled in anemergency session by the secretary-general under a rarely usedarticle of the U.N. charter, called late Tuesday for an immediatetruce in the 14-year-old civil war and Arab League mediation.   The 15 nations in the council ``urgently appeals to all theparties to put an immediate end to all operations and to all firingand all shelling on land and at sea,'' said Algerian AmbassadorHocine Djoudi, the council president.   ``It further appeals to all parties to observe a total andimmediate cease-fire,'' the U.N. declaration read by Djoudi said.   Christian forces, greatly outnumbered by Syrian soldiers, foughtSyrian troops with tanks and artillery along the southern, easternand northern edges of the 310-square-mile enclave north of Beirut.   Syrian gunners also hammered the 28-mile-long Christiancoastline, the Christians' only escape route.   Police said 19 people were killed and 99 wounded in fighting. Bypolice count, 760 people have been killed and 2,045 wounded sincethe battles began March 8.   Casualties Tuesday included two young girls killed when a Syrianshell hit their home in the Christian port of Byblos, north ofBeirut, and a Moslem woman who was eight months pregnant. Doctors atBeirut's Makassed Hospital said the baby survived.   The Syrians, who were reported massing troops and tanks in themountains, appeared to be trying to stretch Gen. Michel Aoun'sChristian fighters, who number 20,000 to the Syrians' 40,000.   Aoun urged the 22,000 Moslem soldiers in the fractured army tojoin the Christians.   ``The hour of unification has struck,'' he said on the radio.``Our reunion is essential to reunite the partitioned homeland anddefeat the enemy.''   The poorly equipped Moslem soldiers have largely stayed out thefighting and were not expected to go against the powerful Syrians.   International pressure was building for a cease-fire.   Pope John Paul II, his voice shaking with emotion, said fromCastelgondolfo, Italy: ``In the name of God, I turn to the Syrianauthorities, asking them to stop the bombardment that aims todestroy ... the whole country.''   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar called theemergency Security Council meeting Tuesday after none of the 15council members took any lead in the issue, and hours later thedeclaration prepared by the Algerian ambassador that called forpeace in Lebanon was unanimously adopted.   The U.N. charter allows the secretary-general to call suchmeetings when situations are deemed to threaten internationalsecurity.   The last meeting of its type was held in 1979 after Iran seizedthe U.S. Embassy in Tehran, said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani.   The Syrians summoned their Moslem and leftist Lebanese militialeaders to Damascus for a council of war in what appeared to be amove to escalate the campaign against the Christians.   The leaders of 16 factions, including Iranian-backed Shiitegroups and radical Palestinian guerrillas, attended.   Syria's state-run Damascus Radio pledged that Aoun ``will bedefeated not by the Syrian army, but by the nationalist and Moslemforces.''   Syria's tactic in recent years has been to use its militia alliesto do most of the ground fighting while Syrian artillery and armorprovide support, giving Damascus room for diplomatic maneuvering.   Until the last few days, most militias had stayed stayed out ofthe fighting.   Assem Kanso, leader of the Lebanese chapter of Syria's rulingBaath Socialist Party, said after the meeting: ``We shall fight adecisive battle with Aoun and we shall foil the plots he ishatching.''   The duels began after Aoun, the army commander and head of aChristian government vying for power with a Moslem Cabinet,blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south ofBeirut.   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standingregulations, said the Syrians had expanded the confrontation tocover all the Christian enclave in an apparent effort to shatterAoun's forces and deplete their stocks of ammunition.   He said the Syrian move was ``in apparent preparation for a newoffensive against Aoun's defenses.''   A Syrian attempt to storm the Christians' strategic Souk el-Gharbgarrison on Sunday was repulsed.   Aoun said he expected the Syrians to strike at the Upper Metnarea, north of Souk al-Gharb.   ``They'll try again and again and again,'' said a spokesman forAoun's command.   An Israeli legislator said Israel planned to warn Syria ofcertain lines it should not cross in Lebanon. If Syria passes thesepoints, the Israeli military might intervene, said Uzi Landau of theright-wing Likud bloc following a report by the defense minister.   Officials have said in the past that Israel would not tolerateSyrian troops south of the Awali river, about 25 miles from Israel'sborder, or into areas from which Israel withdrew in 1985 in theBekaa Valley.</TEXT></DOC>
