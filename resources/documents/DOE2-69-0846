The control of iron input is performed by precoat type condensatefilter/demineralizer system. The present study shows a method for controllingthe precoat type condensate filter/demineralizer performance on ironcrud removal. It was found that the most important factor was the methodto form precoat layer on condensate filter element. A hypothesis on thefiltration mechanism of iron crud was also proposed.</TEXT></DOC>
