Primarily the cost of energyproduced has been reduced from 15.8 p/KWh to 7.3p/KWh. This has beenachieved by increasing device productivity while reducing capital costper device and simplifying maintenance. The increased productivity isa result of allowing for viscous and vortex losses which dissipate muchof the power at model scale. Foundation, electrical inter-connectionand maintenance costs have been significantly reduced by using tunnelsin the sea bed to gain access to the base of each device. The exceptionallyhigh ''one-off'' cost of the turbo-generator sets has been reduced toaccount for mass production in a specialised construction plant. Theimproved productivity, in conjunction with an increase in the numberof devices within the original array, has doubled the annual output ofthe station.</TEXT></DOC>
