And they say that transmission &quot;bottlenecks&quot; will have to be overcome before the power can be brought from Maine into southern New England, where it is needed most.    The Quebec government-owned electric utility signed a letter of intent with Central Maine in February 1987 for the sale of a total of 15 billion Canadian dollars (US$12.43 billion) of electricity over a 29-year period starting in 1992. Central Maine, based in Augusta, is Maine's largest electric utility.    The proposed contract would be one of the largest power-sales agreements for the Quebec utility, which has been aggressively marketing its electricity for export. The proposal includes construction by the two utilities of a transmission line from the Quebec border through Maine at a cost of at least $200 million.    Because Central Maine doesn't need all the power for its own use, it proposed from the start to resell big blocks of electricity to other utilities in New England. Under the original proposal, Hydro-Quebec would deliver 400 megawatts of power to Central Maine, starting in 1992, half of which would be sold to other utilities. Deliveries would increase to 600 megawatts in 1995 and to 900 megawatts in 2000.    But under recent changes to the letter of intent, Central Maine has reduced its own purchases of power, and ultimate responsibility for the resales will be inherited by Hydro-Quebec. Under the revised arrangement, Central Maine will be obliged to take only a minimum 100 megawatts for its own use in 1992, with the minimum purchases for 1995 and 2000 also reduced.    Donald Kelly, Central Maine's senior vice president, said the utility decided it didn't need as much of the electricity itself because of planned additional power purchases from nonutility sources in Maine and improved load management.    As for the resales, &quot;we would have thought we could have got them done a little earlier,&quot; conceded Mr. Kelly.    Although he remains confident the resales will be completed, the decision to make Hydro-Quebec ultimately responsible for the sales was taken because it was felt that the Maine Public Utilities Commission &quot;wouldn't allow us to buy excess capacity on anticipation of a resale.&quot;    &quot;It seems to be an awful lot of power they were (originally) committed to,&quot; said Deborah Ross, a commission staff attorney, adding that the new arrangement reduces Central Maine's risk. The commission is studying Central Maine's plan to import the power but isn't expected to rule on it until January.    Robert Bigelow, vice president of New England Electric System, based in Westborough, Mass., said the company is considering buying power from the Quebec-Maine project but is waiting for the results of studies being carried out by Central Maine and by Nepool, a consortium of 95 New England utilities. Nepool already buys big blocks of Quebec power under a separate contract.    &quot;My feeling is that it's going to be an economic project, but I want to see the numbers before I commit,&quot; said Mr. Bigelow, who believes the project won't be completed until 1993, &quot;at the earliest.&quot;    Philip Otness, Nepool's executive director, said the region will need additional power in the early 1990s but &quot;it's up to the member utilities to step up to the bar and make a decision,&quot; adding that there are alternatives to the Hydro-Quebec link, including proposals from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. He also said it will take &quot;a lot of work and new transmission lines&quot; to get the power into southern New England.    Hydro-Quebec's Mr. Guevremont insisted that interconnections are sufficient and that resale agreements will be signed soon. But he noted that Hydro-Quebec has a final option; if resales aren't completed by September 1989, Hydro-Quebec may withdraw from the proposed contract, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
