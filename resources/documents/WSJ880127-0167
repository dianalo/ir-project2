The announcement caused Birmid shares to rise 18 pence, to 369 pence, on London's stock exchange. Blue Circle closed unchanged at 431 pence.    Blue Circle, a major British maker of cement and building products, said its latest offer was &quot;final.&quot; The revised offer values Birmid, a maker of heating equipment, lawn mowers and gas cooking ovens, at #275 million ($486.2 million), compared with #217 million based on the previous offer, Blue Circle said.    Blue Circle and associates of the company currently own 6.7 million Birmid shares, representing 9.3% of the share capital. In addition, Blue Circle said last week it had received acceptances for its previous offer from holders of 1.1% of Birmid shares, bringing to 10.4% the share capital controlled by Blue Circle.    The sweetened offer, which also offers a loan note alternative, closes on Feb. 13, and won't be raised unless another bid emerges for Birmid, Blue Circle said.    Birmid officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
