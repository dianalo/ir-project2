(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By PC Week StaffandM;Network management and internetworking will be well-represented at thisweek's Communications Networks '91 trade exhibition in Washington.andM;Many of the nearly 400 vendors at the voice, data and telecommunications showwill focus on products supporting multiple protocols, multimedia and multiplelinks for dispersed networks.andM;Cabletron Systems Inc., for example, plans to announce a new terminal-servermodule that provides direct TCP/IP and LAT connections to its Multi MediaAccess Center hubs.andP;  Developed for Cabletron by Xyplex Inc., the new EthernetTerminal Server Media Interface Module will let network managers controlterminal-server operations from a central network concentrator, said ChrisOliver, director of engineering at Cabletron in Rochester, N.H.andP;  The terminalserver module is slated for release in March for $3,995.andM;Micom Communications Corp., of Simi Valley, Calif., plans to demonstrate anew terminal server that enables remote users to dial into their company'sEthernet network for voice, data or fax communications.andP;  The Marathon RemoteTerminal Server (RTS), which includes support for the Simple NetworkManagement Protocol (SNMP), will be able to handle as many as 64 remote userssimultaneously, said officials.andP;  The RTS, slated for March release, willretail for $5,500.andM;A handful of developers plan to unveil a mix of bridges and routers for theburgeoning internetworking market.andM;Artel Communications Corp., of Hudson, Mass., plans to announce the Galacticamultiport bridge, which interconnects Ethernet and Fiber Distributed DataInterface (FDDI) networks locally and remotely over T-1 links.andP;  The bridge,slated for release next quarter, consists of a chassis with an 800M-bpsbackplane and a system-management adapter and houses as many as four networkinterface adapters.andP;  A Galactica chassis with one Ethernet adapter costs$15,000.andM;Advanced Computer Communications (ACC) of Santa Barbara, Calif., plans to adda multiprotocol bridge/router to the high end of its Series 4000 line, alongwith a Token-Ring link for its existing 4000 bridge line.andP;  The new ACS 4200interconnects remote Ethernet LANs over 2M-bps European T-1 links, andsupports TCP/IP, DECnet, XNS and Novell IPX protocols.andP;  It is expected to beavailable in March for $8,500.andM;The new Token-Ring option for the Series 4100, which includes SNMP support,lets companies connect dispersed 4M- and 16M-bps Token-Ring LANs.andP;  Theoption, available 30 days after ordering, for $1,000, supports theindustry-standard Internet protocol and source routing.andM;Network Systems Corp. also plans to unveil a series of multiprotocolbridge/routers, as well as an FDDI concentrator and two high-speed hostcontrollers for IBM mainframes and Cray supercomputers.andM;The three new bridge/routers in the 6000 Series line provide a range ofperformance and support as many as 16 communications adapters to connectEthernet and FDDI LANs over a variety of wide-area links, including T-3lines.andP;  The products range in price from $5,500 to $46,000 and are slated tobe released in stages between now and June, officials from theMinneapolis-based company said.andM;Also at Communication Network:andM;BICC Data Networks Inc. is expected to demonstrate an OS/2 version of itsIsoview Network Manager software.andM;Set for release in April, the new Isoview software is more modular than theDOS-based version 2.0, as users will be able to separately purchase a $5,000kernel and $500 to $1,000 modules that support different BICC bridges andother hardware, said Dave McCrabb, product marketing manager in Westboro,Mass.andP;  BICC will continue to offer the DOS version.andM;BICC also plans to show a new fiber-optic Ethernet card and a 12-port 10BaseTrepeater line card.andM;RAD Data Communications plans to announce OmniFiber, a wiring chassis andinterface modules that connect PCs in a star topology over fiber-opticcabling.andP;  Modules are available that support 3270, 5250, RS-232C andToken-Ring environments.andP;  The chassis, available now, is priced at $1,200,and the modules range in price from $600 to $1,200 each.andM;Canoga-Perkins Corp. plans to announce a fiber-optic modem, the Model 2240,that is capable of sending data at 2M bps, said company officials.andP;  Themodem, slated for March release, will retail for $495.andM;Memotec Data Inc. plans to announce a T-1 multiplexor, slated for releasethis quarter, that will support voice and video, as well as an optionalnetwork-management card, said company officials.andP;  The company also plans torelease its new V.32bis-compliant modem that sports data throughput rates ofas fast as 14.4K bps.andP;  Pricing has not been determined.andM;CXR Telcom plans to announce its first V.32bis modem as well.andP;  The external9632-MM and its rack-mount version are available now through authorizeddealers, for $1,085 each.andM;----------Reported by Paula Musich, Kristina B.
