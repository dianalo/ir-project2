WELCH</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis, contending he's catching up in major states,said today he's ready for a dash to the finish line as voters take``a very strong second look at me.'' Front-runner George Bushdefended his campaign against suggestions of racism.   Five days from the election, the Democratic governor ofMassachusetts and the Republican vice president took advantage ofinvitations to appear on morning network television programs topress their cases.   On NBC's ``Today,'' Bush was asked about Democratic suggestionsthat his campaign had a racist tinge in that his speeches andcommercials have emphasized the case of a black Massachusettsconvict who escaped while on furlough and attacked a Maryland couple.   ``There is no bigotry,'' Bush said. ``I oppose that furloughprogram ... but to go out as my opponent did ... and try to assignme something that is not in my heart, this charge of racism, isgrossly unfair and untrue.''   ``I don't have one ounce of bigotry in my body, nor does myrunning mate,'' he said. ``Even though a lot of civil rights leadersautomatically endorse whoever the Democraitc candidate is, I thinkmost of them know in their hearts that I am a decent honorableperson who cares about race relations and will leave the tiredbaggage of bigotry behind.''   Dukakis, in an interview on ``CBS This Morning,'' shrugged offnational polls showing him well behind, saying that ``we are eithertied or moving ahead'' in major states he needs to score an upsetvictory.   He said 20 percent to 30 percent of voters have not finallydecided for whom to vote, and he contended that as decision timenears they ``are taking a very strong second look at me.''   Dukakis, celebrating his 55th birthday today, said, ``This one isgoing to go down to the wire. ... We're sprinting for the finishline and we hope and expect that we're going to win.''   Later, in Fairless Hills, Pa., Dukakis outlined a proposal for afederal, state and local alliance to combat drug use in the nation'sschools.   At a town meeting in Pennsbury High School, he said hisPresident's Alliance Against Drugs ``will set for its goal drug-freeschools in the 1990s in every community in the United States.''   He called for community advisory councils to coordinate localefforts, including educators, parents, children, business, sportsand media leaders, with special grants targeting ``high-risk kidsand high-risk communities.''   With the race for the White House down to less than a week, thecampaigns were bringing out their final TV ads, including one inwhich President Reagan asks viewers to ``vote Republican up and downthe ticket to continue the change we began in 1981.''   The Democrats contend in a new ad that they are the party ofaverage working people while under the Republicans millions of U.S.jobs were ``shipped to workers overseas.''   Dukakis, in Chicago on Wednesday, assailed the Republicans'recent claim on Harry Truman's memory. ``Have they no shame?'' heasked.   With Democrat Dukakis taking full advantage of nationaltelevision interview invitations, Bush tossed another barb loadedwith ``the L word,'' or liberal label.   ``It seemed like he appeared on every television show except`Wheel of Fortune,''' Bush joked. ``You see, he was afraid thatVanna might turn over the L word.'' Vanna White is hostess on thepopular game show.   Still, Dukakis' television apperances prompted Bush to acceptseveral of his own, including 30 minutes live on NBC's ``Today''show today.   The campaign grew more heated for the vice presidentialcandidates. Democrat Lloyd Bentsen blasted Bush for selecting DanQuayle as his running mate. The choice, Bentsen said in Illinois,showed ``a real disdain, disregard for our country.''   Quayle found himself caught up anew in a controversy overabortion.   While he ardently opposes abortion, even in cases of rape, Quayletold questioners he had no quarrel with a medical procedure known asdilation and curettage, or D-and-C, and said it would preventconception if performed soon after rape.   The medical procedure is considered by many in the field ofgynecology as a means of terminating a pregnancy.   Questions about abortion have hounded Quayle in recent days,particularly following his suggestion to a 12-year-old girl that sheshould go ahead and give birth in a theoretical situation in whichshe was raped by her father and became pregnant.   Dukakis, with fatigue from his frenetic pace showing in hisvoice, campaigned with Jesse Jackson in Philadelphia late Wednesdaynight where the former Democratic candidate received a rousingreception.   Dukakis, introduced by Jackson, sparked the crowd at MartinLuther King High School when he stressed his anti-apartheid theme.   ``Nelson Mandela is still in jail and Manuel Noriega is stillrunning Panama. It's time that changed,'' Dukakis said.   He earlier unleashed some of his harshest rhetoric yet, blastingBush for anti-drug efforts and saying a day before that he would notnecessarily halt aid to nations that refuse to cooperate with U.S.anti-drug effort.   ``If you're against us, don't expect a dime of American foreignaid,'' Dukakis said.   ``I'll work with other countries, but I'll be damned if I willallow those countries to send their poison into the United States ofAmerica,'' Dukakis said. ``Maybe (Bush) thinks there are otherthings more important than the future of our children. ... I say youhave to draw the line somewhere.''   Bush spokesman Mark Goodin, responding to Dukakis' comments, saidthe Democratic nominee has distorted the GOP nominee's position onthe issue.   ``The vice president would never hesitate to use aid as a leveron the war on drugs,'' Goodin said.</TEXT></DOC>
