Gore, conceding ``things didn't turn outexactly as I planned,'' suspended his campaign but said he wouldhang on to the delegates he's won so far.   ``I want no part of a stop-Jackson or stop-Dukakis movement. Theonly man I want to stop is George Bush and we're going to stopGeorge Bush, Gore said, bringing applause from supporters at a newsconference in a Senate office building.   ``Technically, I shall remain a candidate for the nomination butonly to enable my delegates to go to the convention so they canrepresent our point of view in our party's deliberations,'' he said.   Gore, the youngest candidate in the race, joked that in thecampaign, ``I was doing great until I turned 40.''   Jackson, in Pennsylvania, brushed aside surveys suggesting hefaces an uphill fight in next week's primary in that state. ``I donot follow opinion polls, I mold opinion,'' Jackson told cheeringsupporters in Philadelphia.   Gore's decision to merely suspend his campaign followed asimilar action by Sen. Paul Simon earlier.   Both Dukakis and Jackson were campaigning today in Pennsylvania,where 178 Democratic delegates are at stake on Tuesday. Dukakis wasgoing on to Ohio, which holds its primary a week later.   Dukakis, asked about a potential running mate during aninterview with The Associated Press, said, ``I have spent literallyzero time thinking about it. And I will not, unless and until Ihave either won the nomination or it looks as if it's pretty wellin hand.''   Some Jackson backers were beginning to float the idea of Jacksonas a possible running mate if Dukakis were the nominee. ``Therewould be lots of enthusiasm for that ticket,'' campaign chairmanWillie Brown told The New York Times.   But Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk said such aticket was unlikely. Kirk, in comments published in today's SeattlePost-Intelligencer, said, ``Only once in 19 elections since theturn of the century has the nominee turned to the person who placedsecond and asked him to run. It was 1960.''   Dukakis himself said, ``If I were to finish second, it wouldn'tentitle me to anything more than consideration, period.''   He refused to discuss any individuals and tried to steerquestions about the vice presidency away from Jackson.   ``The nominee makes that decision _ as he (Jackson) himselfsaid. And rightly so,'' Dukakis said.   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush continued hismarch to the nomination, with 1,052 of the 1,139 delegates neededto nominate.   Bush was endorsed Wednesday by California Gov. GeorgeDeukmejian, who had initially pledged neutrality through the June 7California primary. But Bush's only remaining competitor is PatRobertson, who has all but halted his campaign.   Simon's suspension of his Democratic presidential campaignearlier this month drew fire from Jackson, who complained bitterlyabout the Illinois' senator's decision to keep a lock on delegatesthat would otherwise have gone to him.   Jackson campaign spokesman Bob Brosage brushed aside talk ofJackson as vice president. ``We're still running for president,''he said. ``There are significant primaries to come.''   And Jackson himself gave no indication he's giving up his drivefor the nomination.   ``We have come a long way, and we will not turn back,'' he toldan enthusiastic crowd of 3,500 at a Philadelphia rally.   Jackson was also picking up the endorsement today of thePhiladelphia Daily News. A survey commissioned by the newspaper, inconcert with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, suggested this week thatDukakis had a 3-1 lead in the state.   Even so, ``Jesse Jackson can win,'' the Daily News said in aneditorial.   Financial reports filed with the Federal Election Commissionindicated Jackson had his best fund-raising month ever in March,raising $2.8 million. But Dukakis, whose campaign has been wellbankrolled all along, raised $3.4 million during the same period.   Jackson's stops in Pennsylvania today ranged from a high schoolto a labor rally to a homeless shelter. Dukakis was heading forPittsburgh tonight, after spending a day in Boston following theNew York primary.   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, at a Democratic dinner in WashingtonWednesday night, was eager to move beyond the raucous contest inhis home state.   ``I expect the campaign will be converted to an intelligent,civilized exchange of opinions,'' he said.   Dukakis is comfortably ahead of Jackson in the delegate count,getting a boost Wednesday from the selection of congressional``super delegates.''   The latest Associated Press delegate count gives Dukakis1,063.15; Jackson 841.1; Gore 421.55; and uncommitted 613.75, outof 2,081 needed to nominate.   But Dukakis was doing his best to dampen any talk ofinevitability. When he was introduced at a Statehouse reception inMassachusetts as ``the next president of the United States,'' hegrinned but quickly cautioned: ``Steady as she goes.''   In one respect, however, Dukakis was behaving as if he were thenominee, focusing attacks on Bush, who is all but certain to carrythe GOP banner in the fall.   ``I'm a doer,'' Dukakis said Wednesday, saying thatcharacteristic stands in ``sharp contrast to the Republicannominee.''</TEXT></DOC>
