The change of course removes a stumbling block from aninternational conference in London next week that is expectedto accelerate the phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons, orCFCs, which are damaging the upper-atmosphere ozone layerthat filters the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.</LP><TEXT>   Developing countries, including such giants as India andChina, have insisted they need financial and technologicalhelp, and the industrialized countries expect them to join inswitching to chemicals that are safer for the atmosphere.   The White House drew strong criticism at home and abroadlast month, when the U.S. objected to an internationalproposal to create a fund of at least $100 million. Chief ofStaff John Sununu objected to setting the precedent of aspecial environmental fund and insisted aid should beprovided through existing organizations. Butenvironmentalists and industry and British Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher appealed to the White House to change itsposition.   A statement issued by Mr. Sununu on the new policystipulates the U.S. will support the new fund, and woulddonate about $25 million to it over three years, on thecondition that this doesn't set a precedent for furtherforeign aid for environmental causes.</TEXT></DOC>
