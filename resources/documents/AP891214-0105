Activists for years have suspected the existence of police deathsquads, but Butana Nofomela's statement marked the first timeanyone confessed in court to serving on such a unit.   In another development, recently freed African National Congressleader Walter Sisulu said the government was trying to drive awedge between his jailed colleague, Nelson Mandela, and militantblack leaders outside prison.   Sisulu, a co-defendant of Mandela's who was freed in Octoberafter 26 years in prison, said he was surprised to learn ofWednesday's meeting between Mandela and President F.W. de Klerk.But Sisulu said the talks did not contradict the ANC's positionthat conditions are not yet right for negotiations with thegovernment.   ``The government always wants to drive a wedge between him andleaders outside,'' Sisulu said in a radio interview. ``We are quiteaware of that and I think Mr. Mandela is very much aware of that.''   ``Exchanging views with an individual is not negotiations,''Sisulu said.   Sisulu said Mandela was likely to explain his position duringmeetings planned at his prison quarters next week with leaders ofthe militant Congress of South African Trade Unions, the country'slargest labor federation.   De Klerk was expected to discuss Mandela's status when hetravels to a meeting Friday with Mozambique's President JoaquimChissano. The South African Press Association said there wasspeculation de Klerk could announce a date for Mandela's release ina speech Saturday commemorating the Day of the Vow, a major holidayfor the Afrikaners who control the government.   Mandela, the country's best-known black leader, has beenimprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for plottingan anti-government sabotage campaign. Six ANC leaders convictedalong with him, including Sisulu, were freed in October.   Nofomela, the confessed death squad member, first made hisallegations in an affidavit Oct. 19, the night before he was tohang for a separate murder with no political overtones. Humanrights lawyers obtained a stay of execution so Nofomela couldassist in investigations of death squad activity.   Subsequently, two ex-policemen named by Nofomela as death squadmembers confessed in newspaper interviews that they were involved.The issue has become a major national controversy.   Last week, de Klerk rejected requests to appoint a judicialinquiry commission, saying the allegations could be handled throughnormal legal procedures. Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee announcedthat Nofomela would be prosecuted for the 1981 stabbing ofGriffiths Mxenge, a black lawyer and activist from Durban.   In a statement read in Magistrate's Court in Pietermaritzburg,capital of Natal Province, Nofomela said he and three other blackpolicemen abducted Mxenge to a stadium, then kicked, punched andstabbed him until he died.   ``I was a member of the (police) special branch assassinationsquad,'' Nofomela told the court. ``I was instructed by Brig.(Willem) Schoon and Capt. (Dirk) Coetzee to proceed to Durban andthere to kill one Griffiths Mxenge.''   Schoon, now retired, has not issued any statement on allegationshe ordered Mxenge's assassination.   Coetzee, who has fled South Africa, made detailed claims aboutdeath squad activities, including Mxenge's murder, in a newspaperinterview last month. Police have issued a warrant for Coetzee'sarrest.   Nofomela's case was adjourned until Feb. 28.</TEXT></DOC>
