She is 20, with longchestnut hair and the face of a Ukrainian Madonna.;   She is also ahard-currency prostitute who sells her body to strangers for valuta --dollars, deutsche marks, lira and yen.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SOVIET WOMEN TURN TO PROSTITUTION AMID COUNTRY'SCOLLAPSE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  People  </MEMO><TEXT>     Lighting up her first cigarette of the evening, Larissa smiles sweetly andexplains why she dons her leopard-print mini-dress and black boots severalnights a week and makes her way to this chilly hotel lounge to dangle her longlegs over a bar stool.;   &quot;For us, life has become very difficult,&quot; Larissasays. &quot;I have a little daughter to raise, and I work in (a) children'shospital but the pay is only 200 rubles a month ($6.50 at the tourist exchangerate). It is not enough to live.&quot;;   Unlike the call girls of the Cold Warera, Larissa and thousands of young women like her are not working underdirect orders of the KGB -- their prime motivation is economic.;   And if thepolice are involved nowadays, the women say it's often to collect bribes foraverting their eyes from this supposedly illegal activity.;   Favored careerchoice;   The proliferation in most Soviet cities of sleek, pricey prostituteswith a Western clientele illustrates the depth of the economic and moralcollapse in this onetime superpower.;   Last year, the Soviet press wrung itshands as it reported a poll in which 60 percent of schoolgirls said that theywant to be valuta prostitutes when they grow up. When U.S. broadcaster TedKoppel visited Moscow last year to film a special television report on sex inthe Soviet Union, he found a study in which women ranked prostitution eighthamong the top 20 preferred professions.;   Many of the young women hauntinghotel bars today have attended college and speak English. But the Sovietsystem doesn't pay doctors and university professors enough to live on. Sowomen turn to the world's oldest profession.;   Across the Soviet Union,police charged 5,849 women with prostitution in 1990, according to InteriorMinistry statistics. But that was just women caught in flagrante delicto anddoesn't begin to reflect actual figures, police and the women themselves say.;  Just a hobby;   Larissa's husband, for instance, sends home money each monthfrom St. Petersburg, where he has found a construction job. But even theircombined income isn't enough to fend off 30 percent monthly inflation in thepost-perestroika Soviet Union. So about a year ago, without telling herhusband, Larissa started moonlighting.;   She doesn't consider herself aprostitute; it's only a &quot;hobby,&quot; she says, and she plans to quit in two yearsafter saving up enough money.;   Already, she has been able to afford a Ladacar, a brown leather jacket and a five-room flat, an unspeakable luxury inthis land of chronic housing shortages. But like any red-blooded capitalist,Larissa is also thinking long-term.;   &quot;You see, I have a dream, I would liketo open a little boutique and run my own business. Each month I put away somemoney,&quot; she says.;   Unlike some of the more seedy Moscow hotels, the KievIntourist prides itself on running a clean ship, and there are no obviouson-the-make women lounging in the hotel lobby or knocking on doors at midnightwearing a big smile and not much else.;   The fruits of democracy;   But hotelmanager Nikolai T. Yefimov acknowledges that prostitutes do get in, despitethe Interior Ministry troops that guard the entrance each night and theprivate security guards that stand at each exit.;   &quot;This is the result ofdemocracy,&quot; Yefimov says. &quot;Before, we didn't have any freedom but we hadorder. Now we have freedom, and we also have narcotics, prostitution, racketsand black markets.;   &quot;We pay a lot of money for these guards but theprostitutes remain a very big problem for us,&quot; he said, shrugging hisshoulders. &quot;If you go to the guards they'll say, 'Oh, there's no problem,' butI'm not so sure.&quot;;   His suspicions are not unfounded. Larissa says thesecurity guards let her slip through a side entrance for 50 rubles --one-quarter of her legal monthly wage.;   That's just to sit at the basementbar. If she meets a customer and wants to go upstairs with him, she must paythe hotel staff an additional $30 in dollars, not rubles; the average Sovietcitizen has no access to dollars.;   Larissa, who charges $100 an hour, saysItalian and Japanese businessmen are the most generous and sometimes give her$200. Americans, she says, can be cheap and sometimes pay only $50.;   Rightnow, she has no pimp, just a number of thuggish &quot;friends&quot; who materializedsuddenly at the hotel bar one evening when she was spending too much timetalking to another woman instead of looking available.;   &quot;All the girls atthis hotel used to have a manager, and we each paid him $100 a month,&quot; Larissasays, &quot;but he got in trouble with the police, and now we are on our own.&quot;;  Almost 500 miles away in Moscow, Irina, a striking blond wearing a short skirtand frilly blouse, sits at the bar of the Mezhdunarodnaya Hotel and explainswhy she prefers the safety of the lounge to the wide boulevards of nighttimeMoscow.;   &quot;It's dangerous on the street, and the people are crazy andstupid,&quot; she says. &quot;But here,&quot; Irina adds hastily, &quot;you have to pay everyone-- the doorman, the police, the Mafia.&quot;;   &quot;Girls want to try this life, theythink they can make a more beautiful world, but their dreams disappear veryquickly,&quot; Irina says.;   The prostitutes range in age from 18 to 30, she says,and some are married to husbands willing to look the other way so long astheir wives bring home hard currency to buy Western goods. With dollars, thewomen can also travel to the West for reliable contraception. Abortion isstill the most widely available form of birth control in the Soviet Union.;  And while the Soviet government has launched a massive campaign to educatepeople about SPID -- as AIDS is called here -- condoms that could help preventits spread are still a rarity. And information about the disease -- althoughnot fear of its consequences -- appears to drop as one leaves Moscow.;   IfAIDS is the nightmare for all prostitutes, then the fairy tale is that a richWesterner will be smitten enough to marry and take them away to Finland, Italyor best of all, the United States.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DENISE HAMILTON, Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Kiev, Soviet Union  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911222  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8L  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,086  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 22, 199100357069,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
