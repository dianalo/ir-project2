Hinderliter said it expects to close the sale by the end of the year and to record a profit of more than $2 million, representing the difference between the auto equipment units' book value of about $12.7 million and the sale price. The three companies are Pitts Industries Inc., Surfaces Inc. and Machined Parts Corp., all located in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, area. The companies supply auto parts to original equipment manufacturers in the truck and auto industry.    Richard H. Hughes, Hinderliter president, said the proposed sale would mark the completion of Hinderliter's restructuring, in which it has sold its interest in oil and gas businesses, leaving it with three subsidiaries: Corken International, a maker of compressors and pumps for flammable liquids and gases; Hinderliter Heat Treating Inc., a service company that heat-treats metal; and Johnson Manufacturing Co., a maker of hoist and lifting devices.    In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. The debt utimately is paid through the acquired company's operations or a sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
