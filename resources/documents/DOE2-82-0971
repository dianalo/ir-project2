With microalloyed structural material the precipitationhardening also is a factor that, besides fine grain-, subgrain-, anddislocation hardening, cannot be ignored. Methods have therefore beendeveloped, with which the amount and the size distribution of incoherentprecipitations can quantitatively be determined. Here the optical microscopeis used for particles with diameters {ge} 0,5 {mu}m, and for smallerones the electron microscope. In both cases the analysis is made witha half automatic image analyser. As has been demonstrated by an exampleit is perhaps possible, though there have only been measured incoherentparticles, to make quantitative assertions about the coherent precipitationstate.</TEXT></DOC>
