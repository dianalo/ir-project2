He said lawmakers will be ``courting disaster'' ifthey do not pass it.   Bush urged members of Congress to vote for the package and then``blame the president'' when they talk to voters.   Earlier, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Wedon't have enough votes yet'' to pass the budget package. He said aSenate vote will be close, but the House at this time would defeatthe plan worked out by administration and congressionalnegotiators.   Bush called the budget agreement balanced and fair, although heacknowledged it will hit Americans in the wallet.   ``There's nothing that is without pain,'' the president told agroup of journalists from around the country.   However, he said, `` It is our last best chance to try to getthis federal deficit under control.''   ``There comes a time when you have to make tough decisions, givea little and do what is best for the country,'' Bush said.   He said he, too, had to compromise to get the deficit-reductionagreement. ``No one got everything he or she wanted,'' he said.   Bush broke his ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge to get thebudget agreement.   ``We linger along and don't get a deal, we are courtingdisaster,'' he said.   Looking to the congressional debate on the package this week, hesaid, ``I call upon the Congress, both House and Senate, to casttheir vote for this plan, and to prove to the American people thatwe can solve problems, that we can go out and get something doneand put this nation on the path to long-term economic growth.''   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today he supportsthe deficit-reduction package, giving Bush a big boost in hisefforts to sell the compromise proposal to Congress.   Greenspan's views were seen as crucial because supporters of thepackage are looking to the Federal Reserve to lower interest ratesto offset any negative economic effects from cutting governmentspending and raising taxes.   Fitzwater and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who briefed thevisiting journalists, said Congress might make some changes in thepackage, fashioned after months of wrangling by the negotiators.   ``There will be some details that will be fleshed out,'' saidFitzwater, but he insisted they would not be significant changes.   If the major provisions do not remain, he said, ``you don't havean agreement.''   Brady discussed changes in the context of mistakes that mighthave been made in the crush to finish the deal. ``I'm sure thosemistakes will be corrected,'' he said.   Asked about the 12-cent tax increase on gasoline included in thepackage, Bush said, ``I can't get enthusiastic about a tax on theAmerican people. We are not dealing with the best of all worlds.''But, he added, ``we are trying to solve an enormous problem.''   ``The tax is fair,'' he said, noting that gasoline tax in theUnited States is ``still substantially below world markets.''   While the spending cuts and tax increases will hurt differentpeople in different ways, Bush said, the $500 billion package is``the medicine that a sluggish economy needs to go forward, to havemore growth.''   He acknowledged there is hesitancy on the part of both Democratsand Republicans who have to face the voters next month to accept aplan that increases taxes.   ``I have to understand the passions of people standing out therefor election,'' he said. He indicated he would not try to punishRepublicans who don't support him. ``I can't bring myself to berecriminatory,'' he said.   He acknowledged that ``every once in a while the going gets alittle tough. ... Nobody said it would be easy.''   However, he insisted that even with some members of his ownparty shunning the budget agreement, ``I don't feel embattled.''   Bush in a television address to the nation Tuesday night urgedAmericans to convince skittish lawmakers that backing the packagewon't cost them re-election.   Today he continued high pressure lobbying to bring HouseRepublicans on board. He met with 20 Republicans this morning, andplanned to contact as many later in the day.   Bush also canceled political travel plans for Thursday andFriday which would have taken him to New England to campaign forseveral GOP candidates. He decided to stay in Washington to lobbyfor a possible congressional vote on the budget package.   Fitzwater said several lawmakers indicated today that Bush's TVaddress gave them the justification they needed to back thepackage.   ``It fulfilled a part of their need which was to have anexplanation from the president to the voters,'' the spokesman said.   ``I'm not, and I know you're not, a fan of tax increases,'' Bushsaid in a nationally televised address Tuesday night.   ``But if there have to be tax measures, they should allow theeconomy to grow. They should not turn us back to higher income taxrates, and they should be fair,'' he added, referring to theproposed tax increases on gasoline, cigarettes, boats, liquor andfurs.   Many lawmakers already are shunning the package because it willhit Americans hard in the wallet, a fact that could reverberatewhen voters go to the polls next month.   The $500 billion budget accord, reached Sunday after months ofnegotiation, shaves benefits to farmers and Medicare recipients andreduces tax deductions for people who earn more than $100,000.   A congressional study released Tuesday said the poor would behit hardest by the package and the rich would feel its increasesthe least. The plan's increased taxes and reduced benefits wouldtake an average 2 percent of the earnings of one-fifth of Americanswith the lowest incomes, according to the survey by the House Waysand Means Committee.   Speaking for the Democratic leadership, Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell echoed the president, saying, ``This package is acompromise. Neither side got what it wanted.''   Democrats, he said in an equal-time TV address after Bush spoke,joined a Republican president to get the agreement. Now, he said,``We hope the Republican members of Congress will also set asidepartisan differences in doing what's right.''   While it is expected to take a tough sell among many Democratsas well as Bush's fellow Republicans who don't want to endorse taxincreases and spending cuts in an election year, some opponentssaid the president had a good chance of getting the package throughCongress.   One, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said that more than half theHouse Republicans were opposed or leaning against the package butthat administration lobbying eventually would sell it.   Support is considered stronger in the Senate, where onlyone-third of the 100 members are up for re-election this year whileall 435 House seats are up for grabs.</TEXT></DOC>
