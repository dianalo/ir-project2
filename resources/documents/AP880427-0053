Governor Predicts Democrats Would Lose Michigan With Jackson</HEAD><DATELINE>SPRING LAKE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A national Democratic ticket thatincludes Jesse Jackson would lose in Michigan and could even costthe party some congressional seats, Lt. Gov. Martha Griffiths says.   Griffiths told the local League of Women Voters in a speechMonday night she believes the strongest ticket for the Democrats inNovember would be Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Sen. SamNunn of Georgia.   ``Jackson can't be on the ticket, if so, he would lose us someseats,'' Griffiths said.   In the March 26 Democratic caucuses in Michigan, Jackson beatDukakis by a 2-to-1 margin and captured 76 national conventiondelegates to Dukakis' 53.   Griffiths said, however, that ``by the end of the 1990s or intothe next century we will see both a black and a woman in the WhiteHouse.   ``There will come a time when there will be a black candidate soexperienced and competent that they will not be able to deny himthe presidency,'' Griffiths said.</TEXT></DOC>
