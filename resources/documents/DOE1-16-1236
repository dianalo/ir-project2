The work in FY 1985 laid the basis fora more focused effort at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), in FY 1986,which is summarized in this paper. Several companion papers deal withmore detailed results of this year's study. The primary areas of emphasishave included the plasma engineering aspects of achieving higher {beta}inthe second stability regime with radio-frequency current drive for steady-stateoperation, the development of a self-pumped first-wall or limiter concept,simplified liquid-metal blankets, development of new first-wall/blanket/shieldconcepts, and the development of inherently safe designs.</TEXT></DOC>
