<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-28-0051 </DOCNO><TEXT>The general principles of single- and double-crystal spectrometers aredescribed using the three-dimensional DuMond diagram and new formulaefor the resolution of the spectrometers are deduced. A method for measuringthe fine structure of spectral lines with high precision is suggestedand a generalized method of refraction correction is discussed. The CuK{alpha}/sub 1/ line profile is measured carefully by double-crystalspectrometers using (n/sup s/, n/sup s/) and (n/sup V/, n/sup R/) arrangements,and a hump is found unambiguously on the long-wavelength side of theCu K{alpha}/sub 1/ line.</TEXT></DOC>
