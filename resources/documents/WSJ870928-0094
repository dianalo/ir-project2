Roscoe Robinson Jr. commanded the legendary 82nd Airborne Division, headed the U.S. Army forces in Japan and held a key post in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.    But after a career of success, Gen. Robinson, only the second black ever to attain four-star rank, is frustrated. Since his retirement in 1985, when he was 57 years old, he hasn't been able to find a job that suits his experience and abilities. &quot;I'm tired of sending out resumes because I get them back with a letter saying, thanks but we've hired someone else,&quot; he says.    Gen. Robinson wanted to sit on corporate boards or to run a national association. He used the executive search services of Arthur Young andamp; Co. and Russell Reynolds Associates Inc. But nothing panned out. For example, he had hoped to land the executive directorship of the National Association of Parents for Drug Free Youth, but &quot;they gave the job to a white retired admiral who had a similar background,&quot; he says. He currently works two days a week as a consultant for Planning Research Corp. in McLean, Va.    Gen. Robinson's experience isn't unique. Many retired black general officers say they face a job market that doesn't appreciate their worth. Charles Moskos, a Northwestern University professor who specializes in military sociology, agrees. &quot;It's a scandal that they aren't better taken care of by corporate America,&quot; he says.    The problem was unfortunately highlighted last spring by Al Campanis, who was fired as a Los Angeles Dodgers vice president after he said that blacks lack the &quot;necessities&quot; to hold management jobs in baseball. George Price, a black retired brigadier general, says black officers represent &quot;an untapped pool of management talent that can do well in baseball, business or whatever.&quot;    Gen. Robinson says, &quot;If there's one thing I think I can do well, it's motivate people and manage organizations.&quot;    A few retired black generals have found corporate jobs, but others wonder if they are encountering racial discrimination after conquering it in the service. Gen. Robinson carefully avoids charging racism. &quot;You just have to draw your own conclusions,&quot; he says.    Edwin Dorn, a senior analyst at the Joint Center for Political Studies, which researches minority issues, says there isn't any &quot;systematic evidence&quot; of discrimination. &quot;We know that many black officers aren't getting good offers from the corporate sector but we don't know why,&quot; he says.    Retired Lt. Gen. Arthur Gregg says one explanation is that blacks aren't part of the social and economic networks that can lead to jobs. &quot;The problem is that our group of former generals and the CEOs of large corporations don't know each other,&quot; he says. What's more, &quot;the climate of the 1960s and 1970s that encouraged the employment of blacks is being replaced by a more conservative mood,&quot; he says.    Executive recruiters deny that retired black general and flag officers are the victims of discrimination. John Franklin Jr., a managing director of Russell Reynolds, says that &quot;age could be a factor&quot; behind employment problems. &quot;Some companies prefer to hire a younger man who'd be more adaptable than a 30-year Army man.&quot;    Retired Gen. Edward Meyer, a former Army chief of staff, confirms that white as well as black generals often get the cold-shoulder from industry. &quot;I know of other four-star generals with similar problems,&quot; Gen. Meyer says. &quot;Industry isn't going to go out of its way to hire generals. They have this Colonel Blimp stereotype of generals that does a great disservice.&quot;    Still, he says the response to Gen. Robinson's job search is &quot;scandalous.&quot; Roscoe Robinson, his West Point classmate, &quot;is one individual who excels across the board,&quot; Gen. Meyer says.    No matter what the reason, the employment difficulties encountered by many retired black generals tarnish a military success story. Quietly, blacks have risen to positions of command and influence in all services but especially in the Army. In all service branches there are 40 black generals and admirals on active duty -- 3.5% of the total -- and 43 who have retired. &quot;They've all earned their stars through sheer talent and leadership,&quot; asserts retired Gen. Russell Dougherty, who once headed the Air Force's Strategic Air Command.    But Mr. Moskos says the U.S. doesn't realize the value of this growing black elite. He says that black commissioned officers -- 10,000 in the Army alone, or 10% of the officers in that branch -- constitute the largest single pool of black managerial talent.    Ironically, black officers don't get much respect in the black community either. In its latest listing of the &quot;100 Most Influential Black Americans,&quot; the black magazine Ebony picked all 23 members of the congressional Black Caucus, 11 church ministers, nine mayors, and five black sorority leaders but not a single black officer. &quot;It was just a subjective list,&quot; says Ebony's managing editor, Charles Sanders.    Traditional black leaders haven't embraced military retirees, who are &quot;more conservative and less given to rhetorical flamboyance&quot; than civil-rights, religious, political and other black leaders, Mr. Dorn says. Some black leaders are &quot;ambivalent&quot; about black officers because the Pentagon has won spending increases at the expense of social programs, he says.    There aren't any systematic studies of what jobs retirees get. &quot;After officers retire, we no longer keep any records of them,&quot; Army spokesman Maj. Bruce Bell says. An informal survey shows that many black generals find it difficult to translate military experience into key corporate positions.    Mr. Moskos knows one retired black brigadier general who was put to work supervising the security of a gambling casino. &quot;It was a sergeant's job,&quot; he says. Gen. Price says he passed up a number of unchallenging job offers. &quot;We want to be more than token blacks,&quot; he says. He spends most of his time managing his sister, opera singer Leontyne Price. Often, retired blacks who are recruited by large corporations tend to be pigeon-holed in civic relations, personnel, or other racially related functions.    Of course there are successes. &quot;Those who want to work can find work,&quot; insists Charles Jiggetts, a retired Air Force brigadier general who now deals with Congress and several federal agencies for General Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems unit. Gen. Jiggetts was vice commander of the Air Force Communications Command and thus an attractive find for GM's high-technology subsidiary. He believes that the technical training blacks get in the Air Force gives them an edge over their Army colleagues. &quot;We have highly transferable skills,&quot; he says.    ---           Black Generals and Admirals on Active Duty                    In U.S. Armed Services                                  Generals or Admirals                                 Number          Percent    Service                     Of Blacks       Of Total    Army                            30             7.3%    Navy                             5             1.5    Marines                          1             1.3    Air Force                        4             1.2   Source: Defense Department</TEXT></DOC>
