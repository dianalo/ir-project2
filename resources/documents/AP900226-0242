The fund said Monday it has put off a decision on new fundinguntil the end of June in yet another setback for the agency.   The deadline had been set for March 31 after repeatedpostponements. That date would have represented a two-year delayover the normal timetable for reviewing fund resources. Decisionsnormally are taken every five years.   Poland has recently won a $730 million loan from the fund andapproval is reported to be near on a $213 million loan for Hungary.   Though small in comparison with the borrowing needs of easternEurope, these loans are important in opening the way to lending byothers. Governments and commercial banks take confidence from thestrict economic measures that the fund requires countries to put inplace before it lends money.   Resources of the fund amount to the equivalent of $117 billion,but much of that is in currencies of Third World countries and isnot in demand by borrowers.   Managing Director Michel Camdessus has asked that the total bedoubled. Although he had widespread support among the 152 membergovernments, the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia demurred.   The United States has been reported ready for a 50 percentincrease. That would require it to put up nearly $12 billion as thelargest source of the fund's money. The outlays would not count inthe U.S. budget because the money is considered still the propertyof the United States, which receives interest on dollars that thefund lends out.   The United States itself could borrow other countries' currency,as it has in the past.   Japan raised a problem when it asked to be the number twocontributor instead of number five. Officials said this issue hadbeen virtually settled, with West Germany as number three, thoughthe relative positions of Britain and France are not yet clear.   The officials, who spoke on condition they not be named, saidthe U.S. Treasury is concerned about overdue payments to the fundfrom 11 Third World countries, which have reached nearly $4.8billion. The fund has set up special arrangements for loans to thepoorest countries on easier terms, but those which have not broughttheir accounts up to date are not eligible to not take advantage ofthe offer.   Treasury Undersecretary David C. Mulford has been asked totestify Thursday on the fund before a panel of Congressmen, thesubcommittee on international development, finance, trade andmonetary policy of the Banking Committee in the House ofRepresentatives.</TEXT></DOC>
