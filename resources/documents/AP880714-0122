The statement contradicted a U.S. announcement.   ``I would say it is not precise to say that an agreement hasbeen reached on the withdrawal of Cuban troops,'' said AlcibiadesHidalgo, a member of the policy-making central committee of Cuba'sCommunist Party.   ``This issue ... is part of all the discussions, is part of aprocess that is continuing. I would qualify it as inexact to saythat an agreement has been reached on the withdrawal of all Cubantroops,'' he added.   ``It is our opinion that we made substantial progress,'' hesaid, speaking in Spanish through an interpreter.   On Wednesday, Chester A. Crocker, under-secretary of state incharge of African affairs, said that Angolan, Cuban, and SouthAfrican delegates agreed that Pretoria would end its 73-year rulein South-West Africa and that Cuban troops would leave Angola.Crocker said no schedule was set for the pullout.   ``As a result of these 2{ days, the Angolans, Cubans, and SouthAfricans were able to reach agreement on a set of principles whichconstitute the essential elements of a political settlement insouthwestern Africa,'' said Crocker, who led the host Americandelegation at talks that began Monday.   Hidalgo was not the most senior member of the Cuban delegation.It was led by Carlos Aldana, another member of the party's centralcommittee. He did not appear at today's press conference.   Crocker said the South African administration in South-WestAfrica, also known as Namibia, would be replaced by U.N. civil andmilitary administrators to comply with a U.N. resolution callingfor that nation's independence under black majority rule.   ``There are some large gaps that remain,'' Crocker said. ``Forexample, the existing gap on the timing of the Cuban troopwithdrawal from Angola is a major issue. I think the parties agreedthat this was not the time to come to grips with that issue, and weagree with that judgment.''   Crocker said details of the principles would not be releaseduntil approval by their respective governments.   South Africa has said it would accept a U.N. Security Councilresolution calling for South-West Africa's independence when theestimated 50,000 Cuban troops withdraw from neighboring Angola.   The U.S. goal is a full Cuban troop withdrawal in one year, thesame time span that the U.N. resolution sets for grantingindependence to Namibia.   Angola and Cuba had insisted that the Cuban withdrawal shouldtake place over four years.   In Washington today, U.N. Ambassador Vernon Walters told ``CBSThis Morning'' that many obstacles remain, including obtainingapproval of the governments involved and setting a schedule for thetroop withdrawals.   ``This war has been going on for 15 years. There's a whole lotof hostility built up,'' he said.   The United States was a party to the talks because it has beensupporting anti-communist rebels in Angola with funds and weaponssince 1985.   Asked if the United States would still support the rebels,Walters said, ``That's a decision taken in the light ofcircumstances. Certainly the Soviets are still supporting theLuanda government.''   Private meetings among the negotiators began Monday under tightsecurity at the U.S. Coast Guard station on Governors Island in NewYork Harbor.   Both the Angolan and South African delegates expressed optimismduring the talks _ a marked contrast to the usual rancor andrecriminations in statements about each other.   Angola has been convulsed by civil war since it gainedindependence from Portugal in 1975. The Marxist one-partygovernment has been fighting the anti-communist rebels in thesouth, who call themselves UNITA, for National Union for the TotalIndependence of Angola.   South Africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border fromNamibia into Angola to support the UNITA rebel forces in theirclashes with Cuban and Angolan forces.   Namibia has been ruled by South Africa since World War I, whenthe League of Nations gave it a mandate to administer theterritory. The League's successor, the United Nations, has revokedthat mandate.   The four parties first met in London in early May, thenreconvened last month in Cairo, Egypt. South African and Angolanofficials held a separate meeting in May in Brazzaville, the Congo.</TEXT></DOC>
