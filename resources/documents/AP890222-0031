RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Supreme Court ruling permitting states to useanti-racketeering laws against adult bookstores could have a silverlining for supporters of freedom of expression, says an expert onFirst Amendment issues.   ``I'm quite encouraged,'' said Bruce Ennis, a lawyer who hasargued many high court cases involving freedom of speech and freedomof the press.   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said states may useanti-racketeering laws to crack down on adult bookstores.   But they also barred states from employing such toughcrime-fighting statutes to shut down the stores before trials areheld to determine whether any of the material sold is obscene.   Left unanswered is whether the anti-racketeering laws permitconfiscation of bookstore inventories _ including non-pornographicmaterial _ after there is a judgment that the stores sold obsceneitems.   Ennis said he is heartened that the three dissenters Tuesdaywould prohibit such post-trial seizures. He said he is confident atleast two other justices would join in barring such blanketconfiscation of property when the high court addresses that issue.   ``I think we'll pick up at least two votes,'' he said.   But law enforcement officials said Tuesday's court rulingupholding an Indiana anti-racketeering statute is a big victory forthem.   ``We won the war,'' said Stephen M. Sims, an Indiana prosecutorwho conceded that bookstore owners won some ``sub-battles.''   Indiana Attorney General Linley E. Pearson said, ``I think thereal reason that you have the crackdown in these kinds of cases isbecause the people do not want adult bookstores in theirneighborhood.''   The law that was upheld Tuesday, Indiana's Racketeer Influencedand Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), is patterned after a federalstatute aimed primarily at organized crime. Most states have similaranti-racketeering laws, and in 19 states besides Indiana the law canbe used to battle pornography.   A presidential commission on pornography, appointed during RonaldReagan's administration, urged all states to take similar steps tolimit the spread of sexually explicit material.   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said theIndiana law violates freedom of expression by allowing authoritiesto seize the contents of a bookstore and padlock its doors after atrial in which two books, films or magazines sold there have beenjudged obscene.   The law arms ``prosecutors not with scalpels to excise obsceneportions of an adult bookstore's inventory but with sickles to mowdown the entire undesired use,'' Stevens said.   Noting that the court's majority did not decide whetherpost-trial seizures of property are constitutional, he said thejustices should have resolved that issue by ruling that suchconfiscation of property in obscenity cases is unlawful.   Stevens was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and ThurgoodMarshall.   Indiana's RICO law provides for up to eight years in prison and a$10,000 fine for each offense.   A second related law provides civil penalties that permitauthorities to seize property owned by anyone convicted of a RICOoffense.   The justices were unanimous Tuesday in ruling that such propertyseizures may not take place before trial.   Indiana authorities said the 19 other states withanti-racketeering laws that apply to obscenity are Arizona,California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia,Hawaii, Idaho, New Jersey, North Dakota, New York, North Carolina,Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin.   The Indiana law was challenged by Fort Wayne Bookstores Inc. Oneof its stores was shut down in March 1984. Law enforcement officialspadlocked it and seized its inventory.   Tuesday's ruling allows the state to proceed with a trial againstthe bookstore owners, even though the pre-trial seizure of theproperty was overturned.   In other action, the court:   _Refused to kill a $90 million lawsuit against televisionevangelist Jimmy Swaggart and others filed by Marvin Gorman, adefrocked evangelist Swaggart had accused of adultery in 1986.   _Allowed Kentucky to begin enforcing a 1986 abortion law asaltered by a federal judge last year. The law requires girls underthe age of 18 to notify their parents or obtain a judge's consentbefore having an abortion.   _Ruled, by a 6-3 vote in a Texas case, that states may not givepreferential treatment to religious publications by exempting themfrom taxes imposed on other books, magazines and newspapers.</TEXT></DOC>
