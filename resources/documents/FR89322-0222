Applicant is a Nevada Corporation and an indirect wholly-owned limitedpurpose financing subsidiary of Lomas andamp; Nettleton Financial Corporation.Applicant engages in mortgage-backed financing by establishing separateTrusts to issue and sell one or more series (each, a ``Series'') of fixedand variable rate bonds. Neither the Applicant nor the Trusts will engagein any business or investment activities unrelated to such purpose.2. Each Trust has been or will be formed pursuant to a separate deposittrust agreement (``Deposit Trust Agreement'') between the Applicant, actingas depositor, and a bank or trust company or other fiduciary acting asowner-trustee (``Owner Trustee''). Each Trust will issue one or more Seriesof Bonds under the terms of an indenture (``Indenture'') between the OwnerTrustee and an independent trustee (``Indenture Trustee''), as supplementedby one or more series supplements. The Indentures with respect to eachSeries of Bonds will be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939unless an appropriate exemption is available.3. Under the Existing Order, the Trusts invest in Agency Certificates andother collateral that is pledged or assigned to an Indenture Trustee assecurity for each Series of Bonds.\1\<NOTE/> Applicant now proposes, subject to the amended and restatedconditions contained in the Application to: (i) use Non-Agency Certificatesas collateral for the Bonds,\2\<NOTE/> (ii) to enter into certain funding agreements, and (iii)to sell or assign Residual Interests to sophisticated non-institutionalinvestors.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Agency Certificates are defined as (1) fully-modifiedpass-through mortgage-backed certificates (``GNMA Certificates'') guaranteedas to timely payment of principal and interest by the Government NationalMortgage Association (``GNMA''), (2) mortgage pass-through certificates(``FNMA Certificates'') guaranteed as to timely payment of principal andinterest by the Federal National Mortgage Association (``FNMA''), or (3)mortgage participation certificates (``FHLMC Certificates'') guaranteedas to timely payment of interest and ultimate collection of principal bythe Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (``FHLMC'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Non-Agency Certificates are defined as pass-through certificatesand participation certificates which are neither issued nor guaranteedby an agency or instrumentality of the United States and which evidencethe entire undivided interest in whole mortgage loans secured by firstliens on single (one to four) family residential properties (``MortgageLoans'').4. Limited purpose financing entities affiliated with homebuilders, thrifts,commercial banks, mortgage bankers and other entities engaged in mortgagefinance (each, a ``Participant'') may enter into funding agreements witha Trust (``Funding Agreements''). In such event, Mortgage Collateral (asdefined below) owned by a Participant (``Indirect Mortgage Collateral'')will be pledged to the Trust as security for a loan from the Trust to theParticipant of all or a portion of the proceeds from the sale of a Seriesof Bonds. The indebtedness created by each Funding Agreement will be evidencedby one or more promissory notes (``Funding Notes''). The Trust will assignits entire right, title and interest in the Funding Agreements (other thanthe Trust's right to receive fees, to indemnification and to reimbursementas provided for in the related Indenture) and in the related Funding Notesand Indirect Mortgage Collateral to the Indenture Trustee as security foreach Series of Bonds. Each Participant will be obligated to repay the indebtednessevidenced by the Funding Notes by causing payments to the Indirect MortgageCollateral securing such Funding Notes to be made directly to the IndentureTrustee in amounts sufficient to pay such Participant's share of principaland interest on the Bonds, together with certain administrative expensesof the Trust.5. The Mortgage Collateral securing each Series of Bonds which is ownedby a Trust (``Direct Mortgage Collateral'') will consist of Agency Certificatesor Non-Agency Certificates (together, ``Mortgage Certificates''). The IndirectMortgage Collateral will consist of Mortgage Certificates or Mortgage Loans.(The Direct Mortgage Collateral and Indirect Mortgage Collateral are collectivelyreferred to as the ``Mortgage Collateral,'' and the Mortgage Collateraland all other collateral securing the Bonds are collectively referred toas the ``Collateral''). All or a portion of the Agency Certificates backingthe Bonds may be ``partial pool'' Agency Certificates, which representless than 100% of the undivided fractional ownership interest in an underlyingpool of mortgage loans, and some or all of any remainder could be ``wholepool'' Agency Certificates. Under the definition contained in the Application,Non-Agency Certificates are always ``whole pool'' certificates.6. In the case of each Series of Bonds: (a) The Trust will hold no substantialassets other than the Mortgage Collateral and a limited amount of othercollateral securing such Bonds; (b) the Mortgage Collateral will have acollateral value determined under the Indenture, at the time of issuanceand following each payment date, equal to or greater than the outstandingprincipal balance of the Bonds; (c) scheduled distributions of principaland interest received on the Direct Mortgage Collateral securing the Bondsand on the Indirect Mortgage Collateral securing Funding Notes pledgedas security for such Bonds (together with cash available to be withdrawnfrom any reserve funds, debt service funds, overcollateralization fundsor other funds), plus reinvestment income thereon, will be sufficient tomake timely payments of principal of and interest on the Bonds and to retireeach class of Bonds by its stated maturity; and (d) the Collateral willbe assigned to the Indenture Trustee and will be subject to the lien ofthe related Indenture.7. The Residual Interest holders, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trusteeof any Trust will not be able to impair the security afforded by the MortgageCollateral to the holders of the Bonds. Without the consent of each Bondholderto be affected, neither the Residual Interest holders, the Owner Trustee,nor the Indenture Trustee will be able to (a) change the stated maturityon any Bonds; (b) reduce the principal amount or the rate of interest (orthe formula by which such rate is computed) on any Bonds; (c) change thepriority of payment on any class of any Series of Bonds; (d) impair oradversely affect the Mortgage Collateral securing a Series of Bonds orsecuring Funding Notes securing such series; (e) permit the creation ofa lien ranking prior to or on a parity with the lien of the related Indenturewith respect to the Collateral; or (f) otherwise deprive the Bondholdersof the security afforded by the lien of the related Indenture.8. The interests of the Bondholders will not be compromised or impairedby the sale of Residual Interests in any Trust. The sale of Residual Interestsin any Trust will not alter the payment of cash flows under the Indenture,including the amounts to be deposited in the collection account or anyreserve fund created under the Indenture to support the payment of principaland interest on the Bonds.9. Except to the extent permitted by the limited right to substitute Collateral,it will not be possible for the Residual Interest holders to alter theCollateral initially deposited into a Trust, and in no event will suchright to substitute Collateral result in a diminution in the value or qualityof such Collateral. Although it is possible that any Mortgage Collateralsubstitued for Mortgage Collateral initially deposited into a Trust mayhave a different prepayment experience than the original Collateral, theinterests of the Bondholders will not be impaired because: (a) The prepaymentexperience of any Mortgage Collateral will be determined by market conditionsbeyond the control of the Residual Interest holders, which market conditionsare likely to affect all Mortgage Collateral of similar payment terms andmaturities in a similar fashion; and (b) the interests of the ResidualInterest holders are not likely to be greatly different from those of theBondholders with respect to collateral prepayment experience.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant's Legal Conclusion</ITAG>The requested order is necessary and appropriate in the public interestbecause: (a) Applicant and the Trusts should not be deemed to be entitiesto which the provisions of the 1940 Act were intended to be applied: (b)Applicant and the Trusts may be unable to proceed with their proposed activitiesif the uncertainties concerning the applicability of the 1940 Act are notremoved; (c) Applicant's and the Trusts' activities are intended to servea recognized and critical public need; (d) granting the requested orderwill be consistent with the protection of investors because they will beprotected during the offering and sale of the Bonds by the registrationor exemption provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the``1933 Act''), and thereafter by the Indenture Trustee representing theirinterests under the Indenture; and (e) the Residual Interests in the Trustswill be held entirely by the Applicant or offered only to a limited numberof sophisticated institutional or ``accredited'' non-institutional investorsthrough private placements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant's Conditions</ITAG>Applicant agrees that if an order is granted it will be expressly conditionedon the following:A. Conditions Relating to the Bonds1. Each Series of Bonds will be registered under the 1933 Act, unless offeredin a transaction exempt from registration pursuant to section 4(2) of the1933 Act.2. The Bonds will be ``mortgage related securities'' within the meaningof section 3(a)(41) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition,the Direct Mortgage Collateral securing the Bonds will be limited to AgencyCertificates and Non-Agency Certificates, and the Indirect Mortgage Collateralsecuring the Funding Notes securing the Bonds will be limited to AgencyCertificates, Non-Agency Certificates and Mortgage Loans.3. If new Mortgage Collateral is substituted for Mortgage Collateral initiallypledged as security for a Series of Bonds or as security for Funding Notessecuring such Series, the substitute Mortgage Collateral must: (i) Be ofequal or better quality than the Mortgage Collateral replaced; (ii) havesimilar payment terms and cash flow as the Mortgage Collateral replaced;(iii) be insured or guaranteed to the same extent as the Mortgage Collateralreplaced; and (iv) meet the conditions set forth in paragraphs 2. and 4.of this Section A. New Non-Agency Certificates may be substituted for Non-AgencyCertificates initially pledged only in the event of default, late paymentsor defect in such Non-Agency Certificates being replaced. In addition,new Mortgage Collateral will not be substituted for more than 40% of theaggregate face amount of the Mortgage Collateral initially pledged as MortgageCollateral. With respect to a Series of Bonds secured by Funding Noteswhich are secured as Mortgage Loans, (i) new Mortgage Loans will not besubstituted for more than 20% of the aggregate face amount of the MortgageLoans initially pledged as Mortgage Collateral, and (ii) new Mortgage Loansmay be substituted for Mortgage Loans initially pledged as Mortgage Collateralonly in the event of default, late payments or defect in such MortgageLoans being replaced. In no event may any new Mortgage Collateral be substitutedfor any substitute Mortgage Collateral.4. All Mortgage Collateral, funds, accounts or other collateral securinga Series of Bonds or securing Funding Notes securing such Series will beheld by the Indenture Trustee or on behalf of the Indenture Trustee byan independent custodian (a ``Custodian''). Neither the Custodian nor theIndenture Trustee will be an ``affiliate'' (as the term ``affiliate'' isdefined in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act, 17 CFR 230.405) of the Applicant,any Trust, the Owner Trustee, any Participant or the master servicer ororiginating lender of any Mortgage Loans (including, for purposes of thisparagraph, Mortgage Loans underlying Non-Agency Certificates) securinga series of Bonds or securing Funding Notes securing such Series. If thereis no master servicer, no servicer of those Mortgage Loans may be an affiliateof the Indenture Trustee or Custodian. The Indenture Trustee will be providedwith a first priority perfected security or lien interest in and to allCollateral.5. Each Series of Bonds will be rated in one of the two highest bond ratingcategories by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organizationthat is not affiliated with the Applicant. The bonds will not be ``redeemablesecurities'' within the meaning of section 2(a)(32) of the 1940 Act.6. No less often than annually, an independent public accountant will auditthe books and records of the Trust and, in addition, with respect to eachSeries of Bonds, will report on whether the anticipated payments of principaland interest on the Mortgage Collateral continue to be adequate to paythe principal and interest on the Bonds in accordance with their terms.Upon completion, copies of the auditor's reports will be provided to theIndenture Trustee.7. The master servicer of any Mortgage Loans (including, for purposes ofthis paragraph, Mortgage Loans underlying Non-Agency Certificates) securinga Series of Bonds or securing Funding Notes securing such Series may notbe an affiliate of the Indenture Trustee or Custodian. If there is no masterservicer for the Mortgage Loans securing a Series of Bonds or securingFunding Notes securing such Series, no servicer of those Mortgage Loansmay be an affiliate of the Indenture Trustee or Custodian. In addition,any master servicer and any other servicer of the Mortgage Loans will beapproved by FNMA or FHLMC as an ``eligible seller/servicer'' of conventional,residual Mortgage Loans. Each agreement governing the servicing of MortgageLoans shall obligate the servicer to provide substantially the same serviceswith respect to such Mortgage Loans as it is then currently required toprovide in connection with the servicing of Mortgage Loans insured by theFederal Housing Administration, guaranteed by the Veterans Administrationor eligible for purchase by FNMA or FHLMC.8. Beneficial and legal ownership of all Mortgage Collateral depositedwith the Indenture Trustee will not be transferred until such time as theIndenture Trustee releases such Mortgage Collateral from the Indenture.B. Additional Conditions Relating to Variable-Rate Bonds1. The interest rate for each class of variable-rate Bonds will be subjectto maximum interest rates (``interest rate caps'') which may vary fromperiod to period, and will always be specified in the related prospectussupplement for a Series of Bonds.2. The Collateral deposited with the Indenture Trustee to secure a Seriesof Bonds will at all times be sufficient to provide for the full and timelypayment of all principal and interest on the Bonds of such Series underthe assumption that the interest rate on all Bonds of such Series (includingany class thereof) is the maximum rate for each specific period.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ In addition to those mechanisms referred to in the application,Applicant may utilize additional mechanisms to ensure the adequacy of theCollateral notwithstanding the issuance of Bonds bearing interest at variablerates. Applicant will give the staff of the SEC notice by letter of anysuch additional mechanisms before they are utilized to give the staff anopportunity to raise any questions as to their appropriateness. In allcases, these mechanisms will be adequate to ensure the accuracy of therepresentation and to meet the standards required for a rating of the Bondsin one of the two highest bond rating categories.3. No Direct Mortgage Collateral or Funding Notes securing a Series ofBonds may be released from the lien of the Indenture prior to retirementin full of all Bonds of such Series and no Indirect Mortgage Collateralsecuring a Funding Note may be released from the lien of the related FundingAgreement prior to the retirement of such Funding Note, except to the extentpermitted by the limited right to substitute Collateral as described inthe Application.C. Conditions Relating to Sale of Residual Interests1. Applicant may sell or assign its Residual Interest in each Trust toa limited number, in no event more than one hundred, of institutional investorsor non-institutional investors which are ``accredited investors'' as definedin Rule 501(a) of the 1933 Act.

Non-institutional accredited investors, whichmay include individuals, will be limited to not more than fifteen, willbe required to purchase at least $200,000 (measured by market value atthe time of purchase) of such Residual Interests and will have a net worthat the time of purchase that exceeds $1,000,000 (exclusive of their primaryresidence). Non-institutional accredited investors will have such knowledgeand experience in financial and business matters, specifically in the fieldof mortgage-related securities, as to be able to evaluate the risk of purchasingResidual Interests and will have direct, personal and significant experiencein making investments in mortgage-related securities.

Each registered investmentcompany acquiring a Residual Interest will be required to satisfy itselfthat such acquisition will be in compliance with the provisions of section12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act.2. Residual Interests will be sold in transactions exempt from the registrationrequirements of the 1933 Act under Section 4(2) thereof.3. Each purchaser of a Residual Interest will be required to representthat it is purchasing such Residual Interest for investment purposes andnot for distribution, and that it will hold such Residual Interest in itsown name and not as nominee for undisclosed investors. Each purchaser ofa Residual Interest will be required to agree that it will not resell suchinterest unless (i) the subsequent purchaser would have been eligible topurchase the Residual Interest directly from the Applicant under the termsof Condition C.1, (ii) after the sale there would be no more than one hundredResidual Interest Holders, and (iii) the subsequent purchaser agrees tobe subject to the same representations and undertakings as are applicableto the reselling purchaser.

No holder of a controlling interest in a Trust (as the term ``control''is defined in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act) will be affiliated with eitherthe Custodian or any Rating agency rating the Bonds.5. No holder of a Residual Interest will be affiliated with the IndentureTrustee, the Custodian or any rating agency rating the Bonds. 6. If the sale of Residual Interests results in the transfer of control(as the term ``control'' is defined in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act) ofa Trust, the relief afforded by any order granted on the Application wouldnot apply to subsequent Bond offerings by such Trust. D. Conditions Relating to REMICs 1. The election of any Trust to treat the arrangement by which any Seriesof Bonds is issued as a REMIC will have no effect on the level of the expensesthat would be incurred by any such Trust. If such REMIC election is madewith respect to a Series of Bonds, the Trust will provide that all administrativefees and expenses in connection with the administration of the Trust willbe paid or provided for in a manner satisfactory to each rating agencyrating the Bonds. 2. Any Trust making a REMIC election will ensure that the anticipated levelof fees and expenses will be more than adequately provided for regardlessof which method or combination of methods described in the Applicationis selected by such Trust to provide for the payment of fees and expenses.E.
