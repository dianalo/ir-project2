The Friedmann-Robertson-Walker line element and the correspondingEinstein field equations are generalized to n-spatial dimensions (asothers have done) and it is found that the authors previous method ofavoiding the singularity at the big bang does not yield a singularity-free,stable, closed, pulsating universe for spatial dimensionality of n andgt;3. Since the modified Einstein equations are Newtonian in form, the argumentis similar to that given previously by Ehrenfest and as generalized bythe author to the Schwarzschild field. The problem of deriving the authorsmodified Einstein field equations from first principles remains unsolved.The closed, pulsating universe, however, is very compatible with thepresent apparent stability of the proton.</TEXT></DOC>
