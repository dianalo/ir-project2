The court rejected an appeal by relatives of those killedin a 1988 terrorist bombing of a Pan American World Airwaysjet over Lockerbie, Scotland, and the 1986 hijacking of a PanAm flight in Karachi, Pakistan. Pan American World Airways isa unit of New York-based Pan Am Corp.</LP><TEXT>   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the casebut four votes are needed to grant review.   The federal appeals court in New York last March threw outsuits against the airline alleging willful misconduct incontributing to the disasters and seeking punitive damages.The appeals court ruled that punitive-damage claims arepre-empted by treaties that limit to $75,000 the amount anypassenger on an international flight may get in compensationfor death or injuries.   The appeals court said the U.S. would become a magnet forsuch suits if it alone among the nations that signed theinternational accords permitted such punitive-damage suits.(Rein vs. Pan American World Airways.)                                                                                                          Insurance Agents' Pensions                                                                                                          The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the federal lawprotecting worker pensions should apply to insurance agentswho represent companies as independent contractors. The highcourt's decision could affect independent contractors outsidethe insurance industry as well. Federal appeals courts aresplit on the issue.   The justices voted to review a ruling in a North Carolinacase that said such agents must be considered insurancecompany &quot;employees&quot; for purposes of the Employee RetirementIncome Security Act.   The case involves Robert Darden, who had been a longtimeindependent agent for the Nationwide insurance groups inFayetteville, N.C. The retirement plan in his agencycontracts with Nationwide allowed the company to stop payingbenefits if, within a year of his ending his Nationwide ties,he competed with Nationwide within 25 miles of his formerbusiness location.   When his agency contract was terminated in 1980, heopened, at the same location, a new business representingvarious Nationwide competitors. Nationwide notified Mr.Darden that it wouldn't pay him any of the retirementbenefits.   Mr. Darden sued, and the federal appeals court inRichmond, Va., ruled that the common law definition ofemployee cannot be used in ERISA cases. Instead, the appealscourt said someone qualifies as an employee for ERISApurposes if he had a reasonable expectation he would receivethe benefits, relied on that expectation and lacked theeconomic bargaining power to get the contractual forfeitureprovisions removed. (Nationwide vs. Darden.)                                                                                                          Grand Jury Evidence                                                                                                          The justices also agreed to decide whether a grand juryindictment may be thrown out because prosecutors withheldevidence suggesting the defendant is innocent.   The justices said they will hear a Bush administrationappeal seeking to reinstate a bank fraud indictment chargingthat Tulsa, Okla., businessman John H. Williams Jr. obtainedloans in 1984 and 1985 by overstating his assets and income.Mr. Williams said prosecutors failed to give the grand juryfinancial statements, tax records and related material thathelped explain that Mr. Williams's methods of evaluating hisworth were legitimate.   The federal appeals court in Denver last year upheld afederal judge's ruling that dismissed the indictment.   Disclosure of exculpatory evidence long has been requiredof prosecutors after indictment, before a case goes to trial.The Justice Department argued that requiring disclosure togrand juries as well places a tremendous burden onprosecutors because the significance of such records incomplicated business cases is often unclear.   Government lawyers said the ruling conflicts with those ofother federal appeals courts and would &quot;particularly impedewhite-collar criminal investigations which frequentlygenerate thousands of documents that could support a myriadof possible theories of defense.&quot; (U.S. vs. Williams.)                                                                                                          Drug Regulation                                                                                                          The court refused to order federal officials to approve orreject the marketing of generic drugs under deadlines imposedby Congress.   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling thatfederal courts lack the power to require the Food and DrugAdministration to adhere to the deadline.   Barr Laboratories Inc. of Pomona, N.Y., a company thatmakes generic pharmaceuticals as an alternative to moreexpensive brand names, sued the FDA over its failure to acton applications for 23 generic substitutes.   The Bush administration urged the high court to reject theappeal. (Barr Laboratories vs. Sullivan)</TEXT></DOC>
