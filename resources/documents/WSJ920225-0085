Hoffman of several counts of illegallyexporting advanced U.S. aerospace software to South Africaand Japan, the U.S. attorney's office said.   Mr. Hoffman, a 52-year-old resident of Los Angeles, alsowas found guilty on an additional count for failure toregister as an arms exporter. Neither Mr. Hoffman nor hisattorney could be reached to comment.</LP><TEXT>   The engineer failed to obtain proper permits to export thesoftware, known as the Contam system, part of which is usedin research for the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiativeprogram. Mr. Hoffman had access to the technology through hisjob at Science Applications International Corp., a closelyheld company based in San Diego.   Science Applications wasn't aware of its employee'sillegal activities and the company cooperated with thegovernment in its investigation, said Stephen A. Mansfield,an assistant U.S. attorney who coprosecuted the case withJohn M. Potter.   From 1986 to 1990, Mr. Hoffman allegedly sold the softwareto Mitsubishi Group, Nissan Motor Co., Toshiba Corp. andSouth African interests for a total of about $750,000. WhenMr. Hoffman was arrested in June, Mitsubishi said it didn'tknow the software was restricted or that it had &quot;Star Wars&quot;program applications.   According to Mr. Mansfield, evidence presented during thetwo-month trial showed that the technology exported by Mr.Hoffman was used by the Air Force in the design of the onlymilitary satellite surveillance system currently inoperation. The system detects enemy launches of ballisticmissiles world-wide and was used in the Persian Gulf War todetect Iraqi Scud missiles.   Mr. Hoffman faces a maximum sentence of 96 years in prisonand a fine of $8.5 million, the U.S. attorney's office said.</TEXT></DOC>
