In this invention,fluorine gas is not used, but polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is despersedin chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), and the dispersion is supplied to the fuelcell material through a reaction gas supply mechanism, and then CFC isevaporated and discharged. This method gives simpler regeneration. Inthis invention, CFC works as a solvent and evaporates in the cell materialto blow phosphoric acid off, and PTFE adheres to the reaction gas flowpath or the electrode and gives water repellency. Features of CFC isthat it does not dissolve the electrolyte and is quick-drying. It ispreferrable to use, as CFC, CF{sub 2}ClCFCl{sub 2} which has relativelyhigh boiling point (47.6{sup 0}C).
