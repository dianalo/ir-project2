He also renewed his public hope that Lt. Col. Oliver North, akey figure in the Iran-Contra affair, be found innocent of thefederal charges he faces.   Bush said Massachusetts has lost 26,000 jobs in the past fiveyears while Dukakis has been governor _ a contention at odds withfederal figures that show a big increase during the period thoughjobs in manufacturing have decreased by about that number.   And, in a comment two days before the opening of the summerOlympic Games, he said Dukakis should be crowned the ``gold medalwinner in the tax-and-spend competition.''   On economics, Bush quoted his Democratic presidential rival assaying he wants ``to do for the nation what he has done forMassachusetts.'' The vice president added, ``That slogan issounding more and more like a threat.''   Winding up a two-day campaign drive in California, where thepresidential race is neck and neck, Bush delivered a speech beforeSan Francisco's Commonwealth Club, whose members includebusinessmen, lawyers and politicians.   ``Under my opponent, Massachusetts has lost _ lost _ 26,000 jobssince 1983, more than any other state in the country,'' Bush said.   Government figures indicate the state has gained more than230,000 jobs in the past five years. The text of Bush's speech said``manufacturing jobs,'' and aides said that was what the campaignwould stand by. Government figures do show a loss in manufacturingjobs, more than made up for by increases in other areas.   Bush said that under Dukakis, ``taxing and spending inMassachusetts has increased more than in any other state,'' andthat the state has amassed a $7.4 billion dollar debt.   Dukakis, responding to the Bush remarks while on an inspectiontour of five-damaged Yellowstone National Park, said:   ``My state has more jobs than people to fill them. We're veryproud of what we've done. ... We've not only built a strongeconomic future but we've balanced budgets 10 years in a row.''   On a different subject, Bush was asked about North by a studentat a Concord, Calif., high school. Asked whether he would pardonNorth, Bush said: ``The question is for me _ pardon imputes guilt,and therefore I have refused to speculate on this because I want tosee this man have a fair trial. I hope he's found innocent. ...   ``In my description anybody that shed his blood in Vietnam withtwo or three purple hearts is a hero for that,'' Bush said. ``Nowdid he make some mistakes? Maybe so. But you're not going to see mepicking on Ollie North.''   At the same question-and-answer session, a girl needled himabout flubbing the date of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor,and a boy asked if Bush didn't want to ``deck'' Dukakis for teasinghim on the same issue.   Bush told the boy, ``When you make a mistake like that, I expectsomebody to jump on me.''   And when the girl asked him ``When was Pearl Harbor?'' he jokedabout being in Connecticut instead of California, teased her aboutnever having made a mistake in her life, then waxed serious.   ``I remember because I fought for my country in war...and I hopewe'll never have another one,'' the former bomber pilot said.   Later, aboard Air Force Two, Bush said he would study debatetapes from President Reagan in preparation for his own encounterswith Dukakis ``because I think it's important ... to say what youfeel in your heart more than reel off some statistics.''   Bush relaxed and sipped on a glass of wine as he told reportershis goal in the debates is to ``project what I am, warts and all.''   Responding to an account in a forthcoming book about PresidentReagan that said some aides expressed serious doubts about thepresident's mental ability to carry out his duties during theIran-Contra crisis, Bush said:   ``I was there. I saw the president. This is so offensive to me.It's so grossly unfair to a very successful president. It reallyoffends me.''   Bush said Dukakis as governor has tried to raise taxes fivetimes, most recently this summer with a $180 million increase inbusiness taxes, sales taxes and personal income taxes.   When taxpayers rebelled, Dukakis was forced to sign a repeal,Bush said. ``This, by the way, is one of the `five tax cuts' thathe boasts about in his campaign _ gospel, gospel truth,'' Bushsaid, calling the other four inconsequential.   Bush said that under Dukakis, Massachusetts has had the secondfastest increase in state taxes per capita of all 50 states. ``Whenit comes to increasing state spending, per capita, my opponent isat the top of the list, leading (the) 50 states.   Michael Boskin, a Stanford University professor who is a Busheconomic adviser, said the tax-increase ranking was based on anincrease in tax revenue during Dukakis' past five years.   In general, that increase was caused by higher income, nothigher tax rates, he said.   Bush also said that under Dukakis, Massachusetts has ranked 40thin job growth and 45th in manufacturing job growth.</TEXT></DOC>
