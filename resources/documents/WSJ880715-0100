That amount, hammered out by House and Senate conferees, is nearly identical to the figure set by a White House-Congress budget agreement last fall. But tough arms-control provisions and a sharp cut in the administration's budget request for the Strategic Defense Initiative triggered sharp debate in both houses.    The legislation would bar the Pentagon from conducting Stars Wars tests that could violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty as it traditionally has been interpreted. Moreover, it would shift spending from Star Wars programs to conventional weapons, providing only $4.0 billion for the program. The administration had requested $4.9 billion for Pentagon Star Wars spending.    The House, dividing mostly along party lines, voted 229-183 to approve the bill. Three hours later, the Senate approved it, 64-30.    The bill reflects a number of compromises between the original Senate and House defense authorization bills. For instance, rather than choosing between the MX and Midgetman missile programs, it would authorize $250 million for each and give the Pentagon another $250 million to allocate as it wishes between the two programs. The administration and many Republican legislators back the MX missile while many Democrats favor the smaller Midgetman.    Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he was assured by Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci that the administration will accept the bill. Mr. Carlucci was traveling yesterday and couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
