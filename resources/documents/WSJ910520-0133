The new machine, the Model 425e, will rival in price thelowest-priced workstations on the market. The 425e will listfor $5,490 but runs as much as 76% faster, for example, thanSun Microsystems Inc.'s bottom-end machine, the $4,995Sparcstation SLC, Hewlett-Packard said.</LP><TEXT>   Hewlett-Packard, Sun and other workstation makers aretrying to expand the market for their workstations into theoffice -- usually the turf of personal computers andmainframes. &quot;That's the real sweet spot of the market,&quot; saidKarl Freund, Hewlett-Packard's workstation-marketing manager.   Mr. Freund said Hewlett-Packard engineers tailored the425e to the business user by stripping out features such asfast graphics and special printer sockets that, while vitalto workstations' usual engineering users, aren't needed formost business tasks but add cost to a machine.   The new Hewlett-Packard machine, on the other hand,includes amenities that makers have until now kept out oftheir low-priced workstations to hold down to around $5,000.Sun's bare-bones SLC and Hewlett-Packard's older $4,990 400DLworkstation are monochrome-only machines that are limited to16 megabytes of internal memory and can't accept internalhard-disk drives.   Hewlett-Packard said its new 425e, which uses MotorolaInc.'s 68040 microprocessor chip, can plug into colormonitors, can contain as many as 48 megabytes of internalmemory and can hold as much as an 840 megabyte hard-diskdrive. The machine has circuitry to process audioinformation, such as music from compact disks or speech froma microphone, and store it in digital form on hard-diskdrives.   Hewlett-Packard said it has received orders for 10,000 ofthe new machines, including an order valued at $40 millionfrom GTE Corp.'s GTE Telephone Operations unit.Hewlett-Packard said it also will announce today two newhigher-end 425 models -- the Model 425t for $8,990 and the425s for $21,490 -- which will include additional featuressuch as more memory.</TEXT></DOC>
