Jack Kemp of New York praises the Reagan economic revolution, which, he says, has transformed New Hampshire into one of the economic showcases of the nation.    &quot;We should not go back to the economic policies of the 1970s of inflation, unemployment, high taxes and high tariffs,&quot; Mr. Kemp tells voters. &quot;You in New Hampshire are at the center of gravity. Everybody's watching you.&quot;    But when he is in Iowa, site of the first caucuses of the 1988 race, Mr. Kemp talks about how he would correct the &quot;mistakes&quot; of Reaganomics that have left the state in economic distress. He stresses the need to &quot;stabilize the dollar, end the inflation/deflation cycle and bring down interest rates with the right kind of monetary reform.&quot;    Iowa and New Hampshire, which together account for less than 2% of the nation's population and have almost no minority-group populations, are the quirky states that provide the first tests for presidential candidates. But in this election, perhaps for the first time, the two states -- one coastal, one inland; one high-tech, one agrarian; one at the top of an economic wave, the other at the bottom -- force candidates to compete on both sides of the American economic coin.    &quot;These two states present real campaign challenges,&quot; says former Republican Gov. Pierre du Pont of Delaware, who has all but confined his campaigning to the two states. &quot;The question in New Hampshire is how to keep this prosperity. The question in Iowa is how to get it.&quot;    Since 1982, 31 banks have closed in Iowa; none have closed in New Hampshire. Since 1980, the population has dropped 2.2% in Iowa, where 86 of the 99 counties lost population last year; the population in New Hampshire has grown 11.5% since 1980. Employment in Iowa dropped by more than 3% in the first half of the decade; employment in New Hampshire grew by nearly 15% in the same period.    When former Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona campaigns in Iowa, where the drop in farm exports has fueled a rural depression, he portrays his consumption-tax plan as a way to trim the deficit and increase exports; in New Hampshire, where many homes are heated by oil, he portrays it as an alternative to other candidates' plans for oil-import fees. Vice President George Bush emphasizes prosperity and the glittery new opportunities of the high-technology future in New Hampshire, but he calls for policies to allow people to &quot;find good jobs here and keep the farm and the Midwestern way of life&quot; in Iowa.    &quot;It's a lot easier for Bush to campaign in New Hampshire than here,&quot; says Andrea Vanbeek, a Bush supporter in Orange City, Iowa. In her state, she says, the vice president can't talk &quot;about Reagan and the job he's done with the economy.&quot;    Democrats, meanwhile, are finding that their message is more appealing in Iowa, where the demand for government intervention in the economy is much stronger than it is in New Hampshire. &quot;The Democrats just don't seem comfortable pushing for a positive role of government in economic affairs in New Hampshire because people here like to think they've made it on their own,&quot; says Richard Winters, a political scientist at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. &quot;It's difficult for a Democrat to come in here and really be a Democrat.&quot;    Although both states have Republican governors and have voted for GOP presidential candidates in every election since 1968, the contrasting economic conditions of the two states pose particularly difficult challenges for Republicans. &quot;At least subtly, the candidates trim their comments to meet the economic situation here,&quot; says Michael Mahaffey, the Iowa Republican chairman. &quot;It isn't enough in this state for a Republican to campaign on extending what Ronald Reagan has done.&quot;    Mr. Reagan's legacy in Iowa, in fact, is one of economic despair. A study prepared this year for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the Iowa Business Council noted that with the exception of the insurance industry in Des Moines, &quot;Iowa's performance in the 1980s has been poor -- whether compared with the U.S., the Midwest or Iowa's neighboring states.&quot;    Land values, which have strengthened in New Hampshire, have declined by 65% in Iowa. While farming has enjoyed a small upswing in New Hampshire, its decline in Iowa has been catastrophic. Farm exports in Iowa fell to $27.9 billion last year from $43.8 billion in 1981. And although aggregate debt has fallen from its 1983 peak of $216 billion, it remains at $160 billion.    The ripples from the agricultural depression are still coursing through rural Iowa, where farm employment has contracted by a quarter, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. In some counties, food-stamp applications have increased by two-thirds and welfare applications are up about 30%. At the same time, the Iowa Farm and Rural Life Poll, a survey of farm families conducted by Iowa State University, shows that 74% of Iowans think that their quality of life has deteriorated and 61% expect conditions to worsen in the next five years.    &quot;There are probably more divisions in Iowa than at any other time in our history,&quot; says Joan Blundall, the director of the rural-response program at the Northwestern Iowa Mental Health Center in Spencer. &quot;People have a hostile view of the economic system, they've been locked out of prosperity, they think the political system simply can't be trusted, and they distrust both Republicans and Democrats.&quot;    Neil Harl, an economist specializing in agricultural issues at Iowa State, believes that some of the state's economic problems are chronic, including agricultural overproduction. &quot;That crisis isn't over and it won't be over in this century,&quot; he says. &quot;There's still a significant segment of farmers who are in deep, deep financial trouble. And if prices fall or if government price supports decline, it could get even worse.&quot;    Downturns in the state's two principal industries, meatpacking and the manufacture of farm implements, have broadened the economic crisis. &quot;Fifteen years ago people used to think Iowa was depression-proof,&quot; says Mark Smith, the secretary-treasurer of the Iowa Federation of Labor. &quot;We've dispelled that myth.&quot;    Even so, many signs -- record-setting hog profits, increasing numbers of farmers able to make their loan payments -- point to somewhat brighter days ahead. &quot;There still are a lot of people hurting, but this crisis has bottomed out and the direction of the trends is good,&quot; says James Gannon, the editor of the Des Moines Register. &quot;This is hardly a boom, but this is a period of stabilizing and cash accumulation by farmers.&quot;    While Iowans struggle with economic contraction, New Hampshirites struggle with the problems of economic expansion. By nearly every economic standard, New Hampshire is enjoying a remarkable economic explosion. The state's per-capita income ranked 25th in the country in 1980; today it ranks ninth. The state has had the lowest unemployment rate in the U.S. for the past 26 months. Growth of non-manufacturing employment was 7.9% in 1985 alone.    Even agriculture is booming, though it is focused more on radiccio than on radishes or other mass-cultivated consumer crops; no wheat or soy is grown in the state. &quot;We have more farms than ever,&quot; says Stephen Taylor, a Meriden dairy farmer who is the state's agriculture commissioner. &quot;It's geared not to the big markets but to sell at little stands to the yuppies down the street.&quot;    Some communities have experienced annual growth rates as high as 20% in southern New Hampshire, a region that today resembles the suburbs of Boston more than the tranquil Arcadia immortalized by Robert Frost. More than 50,000 people south of Manchester drive to work in Massachusetts every morning.    The result of the New Hampshire boom has been ground and surface-water contamination, a crisis in solid-waste disposal, and huge highway maintenance and traffic problems. &quot;You can't get from one place to another anymore without carrying an overnight bag,&quot; says Ronald Poltak, a New Hampshire native and former state planner.    In Rockingham County, which includes Salem and Portsmouth, the average wage increased 38% between 1980 and 1985, but the cost of an average house grew by 80% and the average rent by more than 120%.    Sam Langley of Northfield, in central New Hampshire, who tends a factory boiler, says that the growth has transformed the political character of the state. &quot;New Hampshire is a different place than it was six years ago,&quot; the burly former railroad worker says. &quot;People aren't so eager for a change as they once were.&quot;    New Hampshire, alone among the states of the continental U.S., has no sales or income tax, and its people -- including the newcomers -- retain a deep aversion to taxes. &quot;The people who came across the Massachusetts border came here for lower taxes,&quot; says Dayton Duncan, who was the chief of staff for the late Democratic Gov. Hugh Gallen. &quot;That's their whole connection with this state, and that's the sum total of their political consciousness.&quot;    Many critics of the current election system argue that New Hampshire, which has been holding its primary since 1916, and Iowa, which has been holding its caucuses since 1920, have a disproportionate role in the selection process. Together the two states accounted for about a third of all the media coverage in the 1984 primaries, and the 101,000 who voted in the New Hampshire Democratic primary in 1984 received more media attention than the 8.4 million Democratic primary voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and California combined, according to a study conducted by William Adams of George Washington University.    &quot;The presidency should not rest on a test of organizing these two relatively small states,&quot; says Thomas Patterson, a Syracuse University political scientist. &quot;Iowa and New Hampshire have set themselves up as arbiters and are distorting the whole process. Hanging around motels and shopping centers in Iowa and New Hampshire is no test of whether someone can be president.&quot;    In fact, New Hampshire is more conservative and more Republican than the rest of the nation. Its Republicans are more educated, more Catholic and more middle class, and its Democrats have virtually no black voices. Iowa caucus goers tend to be better educated, more likely to be union members and more likely to be white than the rest of the nation -- but less different from the rest of the nation than caucus goers in other states.    The result is a system that may be skewed but one that places enormous importance on personal campaigning. &quot;Having the first political battles in these two states allows some Americans to scrutinize us very carefully,&quot; says Democratic Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri. &quot;It forces us to have close-up personal meetings with people who get to ask every question of us they want and who get to see our families and our spouses and how we treat them. In Iowa and New Hampshire, people want to see you -- sometimes five or 10 times.&quot;    ---                   Comparing the Two States                                                NEW                                  IOWA          HAMPSHIRE Population                       2.9 million   1.02 million Rank in the U.S.                 29            40 Total area (in square miles)     55,965        8,993 Rank in the U.S.                 25            44 % Black population               1.5%          0.5% Total planted farmland           (1985)        (1982)   (millions of acres)            33.6          0.2 % Republicans                    31%           37% % Democrats                      35%           30% % Unemployment                   5.9%          2.1% Per capita income                $13,348       $15,911 Rank in the U.S.                 30            9 Families below   the poverty level              7.5%          6.1%</TEXT></DOC>
