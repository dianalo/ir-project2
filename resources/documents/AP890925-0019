House and Senate conferees, meeting behind closed doors onauthorization legislation, have made no progress on resolving theirdifferences over funding levels for Star Wars, land-based nuclearmissiles and the B-2 stealth bomber.   Complaints, rather than agreement, have emerged after threeweeks of negotiations.   ``The Senate still hasn't learned to do math,'' said Rep.Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., one of the House conferees. ``Theywant everything and take it off somebody else's budget.''   ``The thing is going nowhere,'' Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio,another House conferee, said Friday.   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., said the House came to the negotiationswith a series of votes that were ``all over the lot. They bothaccepted and rejected every strategic program.   ``This is one of the most difficult ones (conferences) I've everbeen in,'' he added.   Initially, the House and Senate were far apart on the majorstrategic programs.   _On Star Wars, the Senate approved $4.5 billion, a slight cut inBush's request of $4.9 billion. The House adopted a budget of $3.1billion for the missile shield.   _On the multiple-warhead, rail-garrison MX missile, the Senateendorsed Bush's request of $1.1 billion for the MX and $100 millionfor the Midgetman. The House cut $502 million from the MX programand eliminated all money for the Midgetman.   _The Senate made a modest cut of $300 million in Bush's $4.7billion proposal for the stealth bomber, the bat-winged aircraftthat at a cost of $530 million a copy has caused sticker shock. TheHouse limited production of the radar-evading plane to four overthe next two years _ half of what the administration requested.   Last week, the House presented a revised proposal that restoredthe MX money, left out the Midgetman and called for the chamber'slower funding total on Star Wars, according to congressionalsources. The Senate rejected the plan.   A counterproposal that left the original Senate bill relativelyintact was quickly turned down by the House.   Setting the tone for future House-Senate negotiations onstrategic weapons will be Senate action, scheduled to get under waytoday, on a $288.2 billion military spending bill. The SenateAppropriations Committee approved about $3.7 billion for thePentagon's Star Wars program, which amounts to last year's levelplus inflation.   Senate Republicans are expected to introduce amendments to raisethe funding level for Star Wars, formally known as the StrategicDefense Initiative, to at least something closer to theauthorization total. But their efforts may have been hurt by astatement from the administration released Friday.   The Office of Management and Budget complained about therestrictive language the Appropriations Committee put into the billwhich requires that $820 million of the $3.7 billion be used forresearch on laser and particle beams.   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., sponsor of the amendment,expressed concerns that the administration will sacrifice long-termresearch on directed energy weapons in favor of a quick deploymentalong the lines of the so-called ``Brilliant Pebbles'' schemefavored by many in the administration.   In its statement, the administration ``urged restoration of therequested funding levels .. and removal of the restrictive SDIlanguage,'' but unlike a previous statement on the Houseappropriations legislation, there was no veto threat.   ``That will be a key test vote,'' Exon said. ``Once the Senatespeaks on that issue it puts into cement what the figure would be.''   And the hope, according to Exon, is that a decision on Star Warswill trigger a chain reaction of agreement on the other strategicprograms.   ``Once the SDI number is resolved others will not easily fall inplace but likely will,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
