Technical aspects in each field are discussedalong with their relative potential for development. One of the sourcesshowing the most promise is solar energy for heating, although its implementationcost will probably mean only a modest contribution to the total energysupply. Biomass energy has considerable importance, considering thatthe energy potential of all agricultural, animal, and forest wastes alonerepresents 19% of Canada's energy needs. Research is being conductedon ways to use such wastes and other biomass products as energy sources,either by direct combustion conversion into fuels. Energy from tidesis not yet realized but the various plans for using Bay of Fundy tidalpower are outlined. Exploitation of wind and geothermal power are largelyin the exploratory or experimental stage, both having the problem thatthe source of greatest power are far from population centers. 25 refs.,3 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
