Pierre S. du Pont IV -- &quot;the Duper,&quot; aides call him -- has reinvented himself. A moderate, occasionally liberal, GOP congressman from 1971 to 1977, he became a supply-side, tax-cutting Delaware governor from 1977 to 1985. Now he's a sharply conservative presidential candidate, out-Reaganing Ronald Reagan. His ideas -- &quot;Damn Right&quot; ideas, he calls them -- are the most provocative of the GOP race.    The question is how deeply he believes in them.    He's a lean, horn-rimmed offshoot of an American dynasty, a great-great-great grandson of the man who founded the Du Pont Co. His contemporary home, &quot;Patterns,&quot; flies its own flag. He once had a blind date with Jane Fonda, but can't remember what they did. An expert yachtsman, he twice crewed during America's Cup trials, then did color commentary for CBS from a blimp.    There is a likeable, innately playful quality about this man, who once appeared as Dracula in a costume party he threw as governor, who turns out paintings signed D.A. Christmas (Done At Christmas). But there is a hard edge when he contrasts himself with GOP rivals.    &quot;You have George and Jack and Bob, and they're all like peas in a pod,&quot; he says. &quot;But down here at the end of the table is a fella who says, 'This (their views) is all rubbish!'&quot;    Rubbish! That's his war cry as he jets about, speaking the unspeakable. Farm subsidies? Rubbish! Abolish them! The Social Security system? Change it! The public school system? &quot;One of the last government monopolies.&quot; Break that monopoly with education vouchers!    His detailed proposals have earned the 52-year-old Mr. du Pont praise for boldness and imagination. He began his presidential bid with a shopping trip for ideas at such conservative think tanks as the Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute. He found them.    Yet one GOP consultant who considered working for him decided upon closer examination that his ideas represent a repackaging job -- &quot;gift-wrapping without a gift inside.&quot; And some of them today often seem at variance with his ideas of yesterday.    As a congressman, Mr. du Pont voted for the liberal Clark Amendment, which barred U.S. aid to anti-communist rebels in Angola. &quot;I was wrong,&quot; he says now. Today he champions aid for the Angolan rebels; in a Los Angeles address last August, he compared the &quot;pleas for help&quot; from the Nicaraguan Contras to a letter George Washington wrote at Valley Forge.    Congressman du Pont averaged a 48.6% approval rating from the liberal Americans for Democratic Action, more than four times as high as Sen. Robert Dole or Rep. Jack Kemp. Amid Vietnam-era anti-war sentiment, Rep. du Pont voted to override President Nixon's veto of the War Powers Act, which gives Congress a check on military intervention abroad. Today, while still defending that vote, he says Vietnam's central lesson is that the communists won. &quot;The dominoes fell.&quot;    Last year the Republican Mainstream Committee, a lonely band of moderates, invited him to address a Chicago meeting. He was once, after all, their kind of Republican. He accepted -- then ripped Mainstream views in a news conference before the speech, which itself was critical.    &quot;I figured I could get a little more press coverage in the press conference than the speech,&quot; he recalls. And he adds with quiet satisfaction: &quot;You know, they were stunned by that speech.&quot;    Critics see him as an unalloyed opportunist. &quot;I'm still looking for something he passionately believes in,&quot; says Ralph S. Moyed, a columnist for the Wilmington News Journal. &quot;He wants to find issues that make people say, 'damn right.' And he doesn't care what they are.&quot;    &quot;Pete was a classic liberal Rockefeller Republican,&quot; says Iowa Rep. Jim Leach, Mainstream's chairman. &quot;Now it appears he's decided to wrap himself in New Right political cloth.&quot;    Change, for Mr. du Pont, wasn't the result of some political crisis or agonized introspection. Rather, it appears to have been an easy adjustment to shifting national political currents. He is a man without deep ideological moorings.    &quot;Some (change) has been conviction, some has been blowing with the wind,&quot; ventures former Du Pont Co. Chief Executive Officer Irving S. Shapiro, a Democrat. &quot;You can sort of trace some of Pete's movements to turns in the country.&quot;    Defenders see an open, probing mind. &quot;It could be that (campaign) strategy begat a commitment to issues,&quot; says Cato Institute President Edward H. Crane. &quot;But I don't think that lessens the commitment. Pete has done a fine job of challenging the status quo on economic issues, which makes him unique in either party.&quot;    Mr. du Pont himself argues: &quot;The party has changed. We've all changed. Conservative Bob Dole, conservative Jack Kemp and conservative Pete du Pont all voted for conservative Richard Nixon's wage and price controls. Don't tell me that we aren't all different now.&quot;    Unlike many rich men drawn to politics, Mr. du Pont has never felt compelled to atone for his wealth by such liberal gestures as joining the Peace Corps or working in the ghetto. &quot;I'm not saying he's not sympathetic to those people, but I don't think he went through that phase,&quot; says Charles F. Richards, an old friend and law partner here.    Mr. du Pont says he helped the poor in more meaningful ways: His tax cuts as governor, for example, took thousands of poor people off the tax rolls. But his altruism has limits. Last year, four charities, including the Bennington (Vt.) Humane Society Inc., asserted claim to payments Mr. du Pont and three relatives were getting from the $2.2 million estate of a deceased aunt. Mr. du Pont and his relatives fought back in court; they're appealing a first-round victory the charities won.    The quiet drama in Pete du Pont's life has been his voyage beyond the leafy, stone-walled family estates northwest of here. There are nearly 2,000 du Ponts now, scattered to the winds. But the family epicenter remains as definable as a principality on a map -- private, insular, a world unto itself.    An archconservative world. Great-uncle Irenee du Pont blew smoke rings at a Senate committee inquiring into family munitions -- making profits. The family dynasty warred with Franklin D. Roosevelt -- but gave a daughter in marriage to Franklin Jr. -- poured money into the stridently conservative Liberty League, funded GOP candidates from Alf Landon to Richard Nixon. &quot;My father,&quot; says Mr. du Pont, &quot;thought Barry Goldwater was the first person to come along who made some sense.&quot; Given this environment, the remarkable thing may be that Pete du Pont went through a moderate-to-liberal stage at all.    Forbes magazine, calling the du Ponts the &quot;first family&quot; of wealth, counts 16 of them on its latest list of the 400 wealthiest Americans. Pete du Pont and his wife Elise, however, fell well short of the $225 million cutoff. Although outside estimates have ranged far higher, a recent Touche Ross andamp; Co. audit put their net worth at a mere $5.8 million. The figure reflects income, but not the assets themselves, of three family trusts in which Mr. du Pont shares.    Elise du Pont, herself an heiress, brought a family tradition of her own to the marriage: Fierce games of Capture the Flag, with camouflage gear and military-type briefings. &quot;Remember last time?&quot; she reminisced during a recent campaign trip. &quot;That's when (son) Ben put a stake through his foot.&quot;    Pete du Pont's start as governor was almost as painful. He recalls: &quot;Even my mother called me one day to ask, 'Are you sure you know what you're doing?'&quot;    He did. In a debt-ridden state that had endured 22 tax increases in the previous six years, Gov. du Pont eventually cut personal income taxes three times, backed constitutional amendments limiting spending and new taxes and helped pass sweeping incentives for big banks relocating to Delaware, sparking an economic boom.    The political style of Gov. du Pont suggests a President du Pont would be far more flexible than his starchily conservative campaign rhetoric.    Gov. du Pont greased the legislative skids with his &quot;$50,000 rule&quot;: He didn't question pork-barrel projects costing less than that amount. &quot;Rather than argue about some $28,000 curb repair,&quot; he says now, &quot;why not argue about big things, like cutting everybody's taxes 30%?&quot;    And to win big victories, he could make big compromises. Glenn Kenton, his presidential campaign director and gubernatorial administrative assistant, recounts the bargain Gov. du Pont struck with a labor-leaning legislator. The legislator said he'd swing some support behind a tax cut -- if Gov. du Pont would &quot;go to sleep&quot; on a right-to-work proposal that he favored but unions opposed. The governor did go to sleep; right to work died, and the tax cuts passed.    Through it all, Gov. du Pont never took himself too seriously. When columnist Moyed discovered an improbably named dog act, &quot;Pierre du Pont and Sparky,&quot; Pete du Pont journeyed with him to Atlantic City to see it.    There is this same insouciant quality in presidential candidate du Pont. It's a counterpoint to his bristly declarations from the stump.    When he isn't telling farmers he'd end their subsidies in five years, Mr. du Pont is telling high-school students he'd subject them to mandatory, random drug tests. Or declaring he'd put all able-bodied welfare recipients to work in public-service jobs.    Or sailing at flank speed into a political mine field: Social Security. He tells young workers the program will likely shortchange them, and proposes tax credits for supplemental &quot;financial security accounts.&quot; Another controversial idea: education vouchers, which parents could cash at either private or public schools.    But standing off to one side, as if observing his own performance, is always another Pete du Pont, droll and ironic. &quot;This is a country of 240 million,&quot; he recently told a TV interviewer. &quot;And every one of them has something better to do than listen to you and me.&quot;    ---   Pete du Pont   52 years old   Married 30 years, four children    Princeton University, Harvard Law School   Republican of Delaware   Quality-control engineer at Du Pont Co. 1963 to 1969; Delaware state representative 1969 to 1971; U.S. congressman 1971 to 1977; Delaware governor 1977 to 1985; chairman of Hudson Institute 1985 to 1986.
