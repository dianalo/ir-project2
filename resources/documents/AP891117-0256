(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Seven months after putting its firearmsdivision up for sale, Colt Industries Inc. said Friday it had founda prospective buyer.   New York-based Colt didn't identify the potential buyer for itstwo manufacturing plants in Hartford and West Hartford, but therewas an indication workers who have been on strike since January1986 against Colt might become the new owners with state assistance.   In making its announcement about a possible buyer, Colt warned950 employees who have replaced the striking unionized workers thatthey face dismissal in January.   ``Negotiations among the parties involved in possibleacquisition of Colt Firearms Division of Colt Industries arecontinuing with all due dispatch and vigor, and all the parties arepleased at the progress of the talks to date. Past that, we have nofurther comment,'' the United Auto Workers Region 9A said in aprepared statement.   The statement was signed by Region 9A director Phil Wheeler andassistant director Robert Madore, the two leaders in the bitterstrike at the firearms plants that began on Jan. 24, 1986.   The workers went on strike after failing to obtain a newcontract. About 1,050 workers had gone 10 months without a newcontract before striking. Since then, some of the workers havecrossed the picket lines and others have found new jobs, leavingabout 800 on the picket line. Replacement workers were hired tofill their jobs.   Sturm, Ruger Co. of Fairfield, which had expressed an interestin the firearms division, said it was defenitely out the thepicture.   ``It's certainly not us,'' said Steve Sanetti, general counselfor Sturm, Ruger. He declined further comment, citing aconfidentialy agreement signed by his company when it consideredmaking a bid.   Officials at Smith andamp; Wesson Corp., a division of Tompkins PLC inSrpingfield, Mass., weren't immediately available for comment.Richard Carr, president of Tompkins' U.S. unit has said his companywould consider purchase of the Colt division.   The value of the potential deal wasn't disclosed byprivately-held Colt Industries, but analysts have said a sale couldfetch Colt betwen $150 million to $200 million. The analysts haveestimated that Colt Firearms has annual sales at between $75million to $100 million, with a profit margin at about 17 percent.   In a short announcement, Colt Industries said it had advisedemployees that the company ``is near agreement to sell the assetsof the (firearm) division.''   If the sale goes through, Colt said its two gun-manufacturingplants would stop production on or about Jan. 16, 1990. Effectivewith the halt of production, all workers will be dismissed, Coltsaid.   The company said, however, that the new owner plans to resumeproduction at the plants and ``many of the affected employees willbe contacted by the prospective buyer during the next several weeksconcerning the availability of jobs.''   Jon Sandberg, a spokesman for Gov. William A. O'Neill, said thegovernor's office was following the developments. Sandberg said thegovernor was working to keep the Colt jobs in Connecticut, butdeclined further comment.   Colt was founded in Hartford in 1836 by Samuel Colt, whoinvented the revolver. The firearms division is a leadingmanufacturer of handguns and rifles for military and commercialuses. Products include the well-known Colt .45 pistol, the KingCobra Magnum revolver, AR-15 sport rifle and the M-16 militaryrifle.   The company lost its contract with the Army to produce the M-16last year. The loss of that contract, coupled with the strike,apparently figured in Colt's decision to sell the division,although company officials have denied that the lost contract was afactor.   Analysts also have estimated that Colt's debt at around $1.8billion. The bulk of the debt was incurred when management mounteda $660 million leveraged buyout in 1988, analysts have said.   When the company announced in April that it was seeking a buyer,the union and firearms division management in Connecticut combinedforces with the state of Connecticut and private investors to makea bid for the business.   In the past two years, more than 300 U.S. companies have beenacquired by their employees, according to Joseph R. Blasi, abusiness professor and expert on employee ownership.   The largest employee buyout on record is the one engineered byworkers at Avis, who paid $1.75 billion for the car rental company.</TEXT></DOC>
