And he agreed tocooperate in a continuing investigation related to the giantelectric utility.   Mr. Howell, who was a vendor for Southern's Pensacola,Fla., Gulf Power Co. unit, vanished from an Atlanta hotelroom in December 1988 on the eve of his scheduled appearancebefore a federal grand jury. He went into hiding for a yearbut surrendered to authorities in December, saying he had runout of money.</LP><TEXT>   Federal investigators were expected to question Mr. Howellyesterday and today, his attorney said. Individuals familiarwith the investigation say he can give details of the rolesplayed by others in the political-contributions scheme.   In October, Gulf Power pleaded guilty to two felonycharges of conspiracy to make illegal political contributionsand tax evasion and paid a $500,000 fine. Papers filed in afederal court in Atlanta in that case alleged that Gulf Powerused Mr. Howell's Design Associates Inc. to channel money tothe 1988 campaign of Florida state Sen. W.D. Childers.Federal law prohibits utility holding companies from makingpolitical contributions.   Gulf Power's plea ended the case against it, but itdoesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing charges againstindividuals, such as employees or politicians. Neither Sen.Childers nor any other elected official or employee has beencharged with any wrongdoing.   In an interview, Sen. Childers said: &quot;I don't have anyknowledge, and I haven't seen any proof that Gulf Powerfunneled any money to my campaign.&quot;   John Hutchinson, a spokesman for Gulf Power, said Mr.Howell's plea &quot;closes another chapter.&quot;   Mr. Howell's contempt charge relates to his failure toappear before the grand jury; the tax charge involves filinga false corporate tax return in 1987. He faces as long asfive years in prison on the tax charge; his sentence for thecontempt count is largely up to the court's discretion. He isscheduled to be sentenced June 27.   Suzanne Hashimi, Mr. Howell's public defender, declined todiscuss what Mr. Howell might tell investigators.   Mr. Howell wants to go into the federal witness protectionprogram, his attorney said. As part of the plea bargainagreement, federal prosecutors said they will help him applyfor the program &quot;should the circumstances warrant.&quot;   Ms. Hashimi declined to say whether Mr. Howell, who isjailed in the federal prison in Atlanta, has been threatened,but she said she is worried about his safety. &quot;Only a foolwouldn't be, with Jake Horton dead,&quot; Ms. Hashimi said. &quot;Partof the reason he is not on bond is for his own protection.&quot;   Jacob F. &quot;Jake&quot; Horton, a Gulf Power executive who oversawthe contributions scheme, was killed in a fiery crash of acorporate plane last April. The National TransportationSafety Board is expected to release a final report on thecrash soon.   In a counterclaim to a civil suit filed in a federal courtin Pensacola by Mr. Horton's estate, Southern Co. ServicesInc. asserts that Mr. Horton deliberately caused the crashhimself. Just before the crash, Mr. Horton had been advisedthat a Gulf Power audit committee had recommended his ousterbecause of invoice irregularities related to the politicalcontributions scheme.   A federal grand jury is continuing other aspects of itsSouthern Co. investigation, including an examination ofwhether a method of accounting for spare parts resulted in adeliberate underpayment of federal income taxes and a probeinto certain pension-fund transactions.</TEXT></DOC>
