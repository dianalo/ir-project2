The product, Microsoft's popular MS-DOS computer operatingsystem, once was sold only through computer makers, whichpackaged it with their machines. Last month, though,Microsoft also started selling the latest MS-DOS versionthrough retailers -- and consumer response has been strong.</LP><TEXT>   Buying Microsoft's pitch that the new MS-DOS 5.0 Upgradeis faster and better than older versions, computer usersstarted a run on the product, snapping up more than a millioncopies in 30 days. Despite IBM's attempts to woo computerusers from MS-DOS to its newer system, OS/2, customerscontinue sticking with tried-and-true MS-DOS and its sisterprogram, Windows, which has already given Microsoft an edgeover IBM. Since OS/2's introduction in 1987, sales of thatproduct have totaled just 600,000 copies. A new version ofOS/2 is due out before year end to compete directly withMS-DOS.   The new MS-DOS is &quot;selling much greater than we expected,&quot;said Larry Carpenter, vice president of marketing for IngramMicro Inc., a software distributor which insiders say hasalready sold 300,000 copies to mass marketers and computerstores nationwide. Competing distributor Merisel Inc. says itsold double what it expected and is on allocation fromMicrosoft for more product.   Egghead Discount Software, a national chain, says it hassold out of the product in some stores, despite the fact thatits 500,000-copy order was its biggest-ever purchase of asingle software product, industry insiders say. CompUSA, achain of discount superstores, is also turning away MS-DOScustomers in some stores while it reorders from Microsoft.Microsoft says the product is selling faster than expected,and the company says it will take two weeks before it catchesup with orders.   Computer users in large corporations say they plan toupgrade most of their computers to the new version of MS-DOSright away. Although some companies may use OS/2 as a networkmanager in the future, few are buying IBM's pitch that OS/2could be a new standard for individual PCs. &quot;We're going tobe running MS-DOS for a long time,&quot; said Max Hopper, seniorvice president of information systems at American Airlines.   Microsoft's success is no surprise to observers who saydeep discounting of the software -- to as low as $40 from alist price of about $100 -- makes it an irresistible buy,especially since MS-DOS has not been adequately upgraded overthe years to take advantage of advances in computer-chiptechnology. Tim McCollum, an analyst at Dean Witter, says&quot;the real key&quot; to the upgrade's success is the follow-throughby buyers over three to six months.   While analysts' earnings projections already took MS-DOS5.0 into account, the software's success gives the company anedge in the increasingly bitter battle with IBM overoperating system software. Microsoft developed MS-DOS 10years ago for IBM's first personal computer, then soldgeneric versions to makers of IBM clones such as CompaqComputer Corp. and Tandy Corp. In the process, Microsoftbuilt a powerful software empire with revenue in excess of $1billion.   IBM and Microsoft developed OS/2 together, planning for itto replace MS-DOS. But the alliance started to come apartthis year when IBM's enthusiasm for OS/2 exceededMicrosoft's. Now, strong sales of Microsoft's MS-DOS andWindows, a sister program that makes MS-DOS easier to use,are rapidly making that combination a new standard, whileOS/2 increasingly looks like a four-year-old failure. &quot;Theaverage MS-DOS user doesn't even know what OS/2 is,&quot; saysDavid Weiss, director of software for software distributorMerisel.   Computer users say they are snapping up the latest MS-DOSversion because it lets them use computer memory moreefficiently when used with Windows. The current version ofMS-DOS, which was updated more than two years ago, can causecomputer glitches when using Windows.   Meanwhile, IBM has been trying to shore up OS/2's taintedimage, running ads in trade publications that promise: &quot;Thenew . . . OS/2 2.0 is being designed to run OS/2 applicationsbetter than earlier versions, DOS applications better thanDOS, and Windows applications better than Windows.&quot;   But even corporate users who plan to use OS/2 to managetheir networks of computers are skeptical about whether thelatest version will live up to its advanced billing. &quot;We'llhave to wait to see if OS/2 is production-quality,&quot; saidRonan McGrath, vice president of information systems atCanadian National Railways of Montreal.   The new OS/2 is not priced yet, but few expect it to becheaper than the rock-bottom street price of $39.95 for theMS-DOS Upgrade. Despite IBM's promises of greater speed,functionality, and power, few expect users switch. &quot;OS/2 willnever be close to DOS and Windows, I don't care what IBM doesto it,&quot; said Dewey Thoes, a software buyer for CompUSA.</TEXT></DOC>
