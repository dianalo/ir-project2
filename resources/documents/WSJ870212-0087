Things like that build up after a while, and you figure it isn't worth it.&quot; She took a job as a secretary and, last September, began studying for a graduate degree in public affairs. She plans to lobby eventually to improve child-care arrangements.    In Chicago, James Woods has also stopped teaching pre-school children. Despite a master's degree, he was earning about $14,000 a year. &quot;I learned a ton from my experience,&quot; says Mr. Woods, 36, now an advertising executive for DDB Needham Worldwide. &quot;But you give so much in that field, you finally have to find a way to give back to yourself and your family.&quot;    Low wages are damaging both the quantity and quality of child care, many professionals say. Demand for care has never been greater; the National Association for the Education of Young Children estimates that the number of day-care centers increased about 77% between 1977 and 1986, to 235,000. But the professional group says the annual pay of teachers and other full-time workers in day-care centers averages about $9,000.    Only about half of all child-care workers receive health benefits, while not even one in five has a retirement plan. Partly as a result, the Labor Department says the industry has the highest annual turnover rate -- 42% -- of any occupation.    Demographic changes make the staffing problem even more acute: The number of adults aged 18 to 24 -- the population from which day-care workers are mostly drawn -- dropped about 17% during the 1970s, to 25 million.    Some in the field suggest that the plight of day-care workers is of concern to more than just the workers themselves and day-care operators: It may harm children.    Carolee Howes, a professor of child development at the University of California at Los Angeles, says her studies -- of children between 18 months and three years -- show that those whose day-care providers have changed several times demonstrate less self-control and less confidence than peers in stable environments.    &quot;Saying that you teach very young children conjures up images of fuzzy bedroom slippers,&quot; says Ellen Galinsky, a professor at Bank Street College of Education, in New York. &quot;But it takes incredible skill to teach young children in an appropriate way.&quot;    Yet many pre-school teachers -- most of whom have attended college for at least two years -- worry that their careers may stall because the field offers few opportunities for advancement. Michael Olenick, 35, of Los Angeles, left a job teaching pre-schoolers to earn a degree in educational psychology. He says, &quot;It became pretty obvious there was nowhere for me to go.&quot; Some suggest there should be a well-paid &quot;master teacher&quot; position for pre-school teachers, as well as for other educators.    Some day-care workers are resentful, saying that they are, in effect, subsidizing parents by working for low wages. Patricia McGibbon quit teaching day-care children in Mendham, N.J., frustrated that she was helping parents in a wealthy community but was making only $9,000 a year. &quot;I liked what I was doing,&quot; she says, &quot;but I wanted a home and a decent life, too.&quot; But providing a decent life usually means higher fees -- yet many parents are already hard-pressed to afford child care.    Some day-care operators are trying to lift pay. Yvette Bass of Piscataway, N.J., plans to open a center this spring that offers above-average salaries and benefits -- about $14,000 for the typical teacher and $40,000 each for a head teacher and director. But her rates will also be high -- between $455 and $540 a month, depending on the age of the child. With her marketing efforts not yet under way, there isn't any way to gauge acceptance of those rates.    Where operators and parents are unable or unwilling to afford higher salaries and rates, labor unions have stepped up organizing activities, promising workers a better shake. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees represents about 25,000 day-care workers, for instance, principally at private nonprofit centers in New York. And the United Auto Workers union's District 65, which specializes in unionizing small work sites around the U.S., has so far organized about 35 centers and 2,000 workers.    In Massachusetts, a union-backed law took effect last year, granting workers a 30% pay increase at 300 state-funded centers, partly at taxpayers' expense. Teachers now earn $14,100 a year at the centers, used mainly by low-income people (whose fees rose). Wages for teachers' aides jumped to $11,800 a year, from $7,800. The pay raises at those centers prompted many private centers in the state to increase salaries as well.    &quot;The issue wasn't as simple as raising rates at the centers,&quot; says Nancy DeProsse, a District 65 official. &quot;It's expensive for families even when workers aren't paid well. So unions have to get involved in the political process.&quot;    The Minnesota Child Care Workers Alliance is pressing for similar state help, but wants the law to specify that a day-care center can get more state money only if it has an above-average wage scale. &quot;A lot of centers pay low wages and still charge high rates,&quot; says Margaret Boyer, the coordinator of the alliance. &quot;They just put the money into profits.&quot; California is expected to increase its support for centers serving low-income families because of a new law requiring welfare recipients with children over six years old to work, or to participate in job-training.    Day-care advocates hope the federal government will contribute more funds, both to expand services for low- and moderate-income families and to fund community referral centers and help states improve standards for day-care centers.    Those standards should include higher pay, advocates say. Says Helen Blank, the director of child care of the Children's Defense Fund, a Washington advocacy group: &quot;The need is so strong -- and people are feeling so frustrated -- that I think they will begin pushing very hard.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
