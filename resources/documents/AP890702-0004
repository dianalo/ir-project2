The flooding, the aftermath of record rainfall from TropicalStorm Allison, could continue for weeks, meteorolgists said.   Dallas fire officials received reports of two tornadoes touchingdown. The storms knocked down power lines, leaving about 50,000homes without electricity, authorities said.   About a dozen mobile homes near Lake Worth were knocked offfoundations and struck by wind-blown trees, said Fort Worth FireDepartment spokesman Walter McConnell.   There were no immediate reports of injuries.   In Louisiana, at least 700 homes and numerous roads remainedflooded, with scattered storms and showers replacing the unremittingrain of the previous five days. One town got nearly 29 inches ofrain in less than a week.   A tornado destroyed a taxidermy business and 70 mph winds sweptthe outskirts of Alexandria, in the central part of Louisiana, saidSgt. Anthony Ribaudo of the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Department.   Ribaudo said he couldn't tell if the storm would worsen floodingin the area.   ``It's already so bad one more storm doesn't seem likeanything,'' he said.   An earthen dam in another rural part of the state was reportednear collapse, and most residents near it had evacuated.   In Alexandria, a 12-year-old boy died when he jumped into astorm-flooded ditch and was sucked into a culvert Saturdayafternoon, one of three deaths blamed on the storm, authoritiessaid. Four deaths were blamed on the storm in Texas.   In Mississippi, authorities braved rain and lightning to searchfor a teen-ager missing after he and a companion went swimming in aswollen creek.   The body of the companion was recovered early Sunday nearNatchez, on the east bank of the Mississippi.   About 180 miles north, about 200 people were evacuated fromCoahoma County homes as a flood swept through their neighborhoods.   During the night, Allison's leftover rain and thunderstorms movedslowly eastward and shifted the heavy rain pattern into theTennessee and Ohio valleys.   The National Weather Service said fields and timberland werelikely to stay flooded for weeks because there was nowhere for allthe water to go.   ``The Red River itself is at bank-full from Grand Ecoredownstream to Alexandria and below,'' said Ernest Ethridge, aweather service meteorologist in Shreveport.   ``All these tributaries that received the torrential rains areunable to empty their water into the main channel,'' he said. ``Soit spreads out, becomes a big lake.''   At least 10 parishes _ Louisiana's equivalent of counties _ got12 to 15 inches of rain, he said, with 20 inches or more measured inWinn and Natchitoches parishes. He said some lakes and riverscrested Sunday and others were expected to do so Monday or later.All were flooding, he said.   In Winn Parish, about 70 miles southeast of Shreveport, deputieskept watch on the deteriorating Mirror Lake Dam, which initially hadbeen expected to collapse by daybreak.   ``It's doing better than we thought it would. But it's not goingto hold long,'' said Deputy Benjamin Phelps. ``Some trees that wereholding it yesterday washed out during the night. Now it's justdirt.''   He said no evacuation had been ordered, but most of the people inthe 50 or so homes nearby left on their own.   ``There's people getting smart and getting out,'' he said.   About 100 houses were evacuated around Saline Lake, along thewestern edge of the parish.   Downstream, authorities estimated that the flooded lake SalineLake, where about 100 houses were evacuated, would rise at least anextra foot if the Mirror Lake Dam broke.   Winnfield got the week's worst rain _ 28.75 inches sinceWednesday.   ``The sun's out ... and the water's receding at the present,''said Mayor Max Kelley. However, he said, more storms were expectedand the Dugdemona River had not yet crested. About 100 houses wereflooded in the town.   ``I would imagine our economy is going to suffer,'' he said.   At the weather service, Ethridge said Winnfield got 32 inches ofrain in June _ the wettest month on record and 7 inches above theprevious record, set in December 1983. Shreveport had its wettestJune ever, with 17.01 inches of rain. He said lowland flooding wouldcontinue to increase for the next few days, and then probably remainfor a couple of weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
