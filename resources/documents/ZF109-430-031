 NEW 3-D TERMINAL.andM;Sun Microsystems last Wednesday launched the lowest-cost color RISCworkstation in the industry, disclosed three major U.S.andP;  value-added dealeragreements and unveiled a new release of the OpenWindows applicationenvironment, which features the OPEN LOOK graphical user interface in 3-D.andM;Sun introduced the color SPARCstation IPC, priced at $9,995 (U.S.andP;  list),including a 207-megabyte hard disk drive.andP;  A diskless version costs $8,995.andO;The system features the new OpenWindows Version 2 user environment thatcontains 14 DeskSet productivity tools in 3-D, based on OPEN LOOK.andM;Like all SPARCstations, the new computer runs the industry's largestselection of RISC software, including Lotus 1-2-3, WordPerfect, WingZ andFrameMaker.andM;Targeted at commercial and technical users in Fortune 1000 companies, theannouncements signal a new era of affordability and availability for Sun'spowerful SPARC/UNIX workgroup computing solutions.andM;WORK-GROUP COMPUTING &quot;Workgroup computing&quot; refers to the way companies andorganizations are boosting productivity by sharing resources and informationusing &quot;clients&quot;-- powerful desktop workstations -- linked to servers thatstore and manipulate information.andM;&quot;Our customers seek three things that are answered by today's announcements,&quot;said Scott McNealy, Sun's president and chief executive officer.andP;  &quot;They wantworkgroup computing systems that are easy to purchase, easy to use and easyto afford.andM;&quot;These parameters -- coupled with powerful networking capabilities andapplication availability -- define the battle for the desktop.&quot;andM;NEW VALUE-ADDED DEALER AGREEMENTS Intelligent Electronics, MicroAge and NYNEXwill resell Sun's products through many of their locations, offeringcomputers in combination with software, training and support.andP;  Sun expectsthat within a year, approximately 200 IE, MicroAge and NYNEX outlets will beselling Sun products in the United States, thereby significantly expandingSun's penetration of commercial markets.andM;According to Joe Roebuck, Sun's vice president of U.S.andP;  sales: &quot;It's clearthat the PC retail model has led to over-distribution, which serves theinterests of neither dealers nor customers.andP;  Under our structure, selectedresellers will become `desktop integrators,' certified to install andmaintain UNIX-based networks.andP;  They won't just sell boxes.andP;  They'll berequired to provide customers with the highest level of service and support.&quot;andM;FIRST COLOR RISC WORKSTATION UNDER $10,000 The new color SPARCstation IPCfurther delivers on Sun's desktop computing strategy, since it is the leastexpensive, fully configured color RISC workstation available today.andP;  At$9,995 -- below the cost of many high-end PCs--it offers the processingpower, small package, broad connectivity and built-in networking thatcorporate users increasingly require.andM;The compact, 15.8-MIPS desktop system is expandable and includes aDOS-compatible, 3.5-inch floppy drive and a 207-megabyte hard disk drive.andP;  Adiskless version is also available that contains a floppy drive only.andP;  Thenew IPC features 8 to 24 megabytes of memory and a 16-inch color monitor.andP;  Itis currently being shipped in volume.andM;Unlike PC's that are limited to stand-alone applications or simplefile-sharing in homogeneous environments, it makes full use of corporateresources.andP;  In addition, the OPEN LOOK user interface makes the SPARCstationIPC as easy to use as a Macintosh.andM;OPENWINDOWS Sun's new release of the OpenWindows application environmentfeatures the OPEN LOOK user interface in 3-D, as well as 3-D DeskSet toolsand a new XView toolkit for designing 3-D OPEN LOOK applications.andP;  It alsoincludes a new release of the X11nNeWS Window System that is five timesfaster than the previous versions for tasks such as window creation, moving,resizing, opening and closing.andP;  All diskfull SPARCstation IPC's will beshipped with the new OpenWindows Version 2.andM;SPARCstations Succeeding in Corporate World Several recent wins for Sununderscore the SPARCstation's success in the Fortune 1000.andP;  Xerox will resellSun systems, including the new SPARCstation IPC, in an agreement worth morethan $200 million.andP;  The Sun computers will be the platform for a new line ofXerox document processing systems.andM;Other corporate users have chosen Sun's SPARC systems, such as Merrill Lynch,which will use the new SPARCstation IPC as a trader's workstation.andP;  DunkinDonuts will rely on Sun for managing its central database functions, whileCarnival Cruise Lines is automating several of its cruise operations viaSPARC computers from Sun.andP;  The Portland Trailblazers will use Sun's SPARCcomputers for an advanced new ticketing and information system.andM;Distribution agreements have been signed with three major computer resellerorganizations, Intelligent Electronics (IE) of Exton, Penn., MicroAge Inc.,andO;Tempe, Ariz., and NYNEX Business Information Systems Co., White Plains, N.Y.andO;This marks the first time Sun has distributed its computers through U.S.andO;dealer channels.andM;Sun Microsystems is 16.5 percent owned by ATandamp;T.andP;  ATandamp;T has an option toincrease their ownership to 20 percent.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
