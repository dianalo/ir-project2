The result is further postponement of possible Senateratification of two nuclear test treaties completed more than adecade ago. The treaties would limit underground blasts to 150kilotons.   President Reagan has said he would submit the 1974 accord onweapons tests and the 1976 agreement on tests for civilian purposesonly if agreement were reached on air-tight procedures to guardagainst cheating.   Reagan has accused the Soviets of carrying out tests thatprobably exceeded the permissible ceiling. Some American expertsdoubted the Soviets had violated the treaties, which both sides aresupposed to be obseving even though the Senate has not approved thepacts.   Other experts said the problem was a lack of reliable ways tomeasure underground blasts _ the only kind still legal _ and it wasdifficult to tell whether the Soviets were in compliance.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, meanwhile, suspended allSoviets tests in August 1985 and invited the United States to jointhe moratorium. The Reagan administration rejected the proposal.Administration officials said it was necessary to conduct U.S. testsin Nevada to improve American nuclear weapons, and the Sovietsresumed testing in February 1987.   The latest round of talks, which adjourned Thursday in Genevaafter four months, was termed a success by Charles E. Redman, theState Department spokesman.   He said work on the 1976 civilian test ban treaty ``has beensubstantially finished.'' But Redman said further work was requiredon the 1974 accord, which is far more important since it deals withweapons development.   The main problem, he said, is that the Soviets want to placerestrictions on the American system of measurement, known as CORTEX,which is being used under the 1976 treaty. Some American expertsconsider the method of using cables dropped into a foot-wide holeparallel to the test shaft more reliable than remote seismicmeasurements.   The two sides did not set a date for resuming the negotiations.That is a decision to be taken by the Bush administration.   Last July, Americans and Soviets carried out a joint experimentat the U.S. test site in Nevada on verification procedures. A secondjoint experiment was held in Semipalatinsk in September.</TEXT></DOC>
