Although his agreement to attend a Mideast peaceconference is a significant move, Mr. Assad hasn't shown manyother signs of change, given all he has achieved with theblessing of the U.S.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Assad's diplomatic decision to join the U.S. plantriggered a chain reaction that could lead to the firstserious peace effort in over a decade. But whether itsucceeds or not, Mr. Assad, an astute, long-range thinker,almost surely will get more out of the effort than he will becalled upon to give. Indeed, it appears he concluded that hispolitical survival depended on hitching his future to theU.S.   In recent years, the Syrian dictator witnessed with alarmthe collapse of his superpower patron, the Soviet Union; thedeterioration of his economy; isolation in the Arab worldbecause of Syria's support for non-Arab Iran in the Iran-Iraqwar; and estrangement from the U.S. because of his support ofterrorist groups.   But in recent months, Mr. Assad has seen a sharp change inhis fortunes. With U.S. acquiescence, he has achieved controlover neighboring Lebanon; Saudi Arabia and other oil-richPersian Gulf states are providing aid; his enemy Iraq hasbeen militarily devastated in the Gulf War, and Secretary ofState James Baker has become a regular visitor to Damascus.   Meanwhile, although the Bush administration encouragedSaudi Arabia to send aid to Syria, Mr. Assad used much of thewindfall to purchase such weapons as extended-range Scudmissiles from North Korea and tanks and MiG-29 jet fightersfrom the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.   U.S. intelligence officials say Syria continues to providesanctuary and training facilities for terrorist groups. Butlast week during a news conference in Jerusalem, SecretaryBaker seemed to play down Mr. Assad's role in suchactivities, saying that &quot;we have our differences&quot; withDamascus over the issue. That was less harsh than theofficial &quot;press guidance&quot; that Mr. Baker's department uses inWashington that says the U.S. has &quot;major differences&quot; withSyria over terrorism.   &quot;I don't think Hafez Assad has had a religiousconversion,&quot; says Democratic Rep. Wayne Owens of Utah, amember of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who met withMr. Assad for three hours this month. &quot;But I think he nowdoes see clearly that his self-interest is served by beingthere at the peace table.&quot;   According to U.S. officials and Mideast analysts whotravel frequently to the region, Mr. Assad began sendingsignals in 1987 that he wanted to repair relations with theU.S. In April of that year, Mikhail Gorbachev, the Sovietleader, had shocked Mr. Assad, who was visiting Moscow, whenhe told him that Syria's dream of achieving military paritywith Israel was unrealistic and that it was time to makepeace with the Jewish state. But Mr. Assad still hoped thatMr. Gorbachev might be replaced or that Syria would still bebacked by its East European allies.   Those hopes vanished in 1989 with the crumbling of theBerlin Wall and the violent overthrow of Nicolae Ceausescu ofRomania. Mr. Assad immediately sent a stronger signal,resuming full diplomatic relations with Egypt, the leadingmoderate Arab state and the only one that formally recognizedIsrael.   The Gulf War crushed Mr. Assad's enemy Saddam Hussein, butalso made the Syrian leader realize how weak he was, analystssay. Iraq had provided &quot;Arab strategic depth&quot; for therejectionist front against Israel, but now Mr. Assad stoodalone. &quot;He feared that if the U.S. withdrew from the game, hewould be left to the mercy of Israel,&quot; says one analyst.   Moreover, Syria's economy needed Western technology, whichMr. Assad knew would be difficult to get without Washington'sapproval. Syria has shortages of housing, electricity andwater and its population is expected to double, to 25million, over the next two decades. Mr. Assad's ability toexpand his oil production depends heavily on U.S. technology.   As a result, Mr. Assad signed on to the U.S. peace plan,receiving assurances that Washington would remain activelyinvolved and paving the way for his acceptance in the West asthe newest member of the moderate Arab axis.</TEXT></DOC>
