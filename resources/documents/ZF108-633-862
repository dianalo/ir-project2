 Microsoft, IBM and others hope to lure'computerphobes' with the idea that graphical interfaces are apanacea for training problems, but even a computer with agraphical interface takes time to learn.andP;  Many graphical programsactually reduce productivity by making word processing and othertasks excessively complex.andP;  A character-driven 'shell' interfaceis the best alternative for many users, combining ease of use withrelatively low processing overhead.andP;  Products available includeQuarterdeck's Desqview and Central Point Software's PC Tools.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Graphical User InterfaceCommand-Driven User InterfacesCharacter GraphicsSoftware SelectionStrategic Planning.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Graphical Interfaces Are Cute, But They Aren't Worth the WaitandM;Everybody seems to be asking me lately whenever Windows 3.0 is really &quot;worthit.&quot;andP;  I've come to the conclusion that graphical interfaces in general arenot worth their trouble.andP;  But there seems to be an industry imperative tosell users hardware we don't need and to get us to replace perfectly goodapplications with perfectly slow ones.andM;The small computer market has become a replacement market.andP;  The new machinesare replacing terminals, word processors and slower microcomputers.andM;But now, replacing character-driven programs with graphics-driven ones haslet Microsoft Corp. arrive at a point where its applications bring in moremoney than its near-ubiquitous systems software.andP;  Of course they want you touse Windows -- look at all the neat Microsoft programs you'll want to buywhen you have Windows.andP;  And why wouldn't IBM Corp. and Apple Computer Inc.andO;want to make sure you get that 8M of RAM in a fast 32-bit computer you'llneed to run the latest gargantuan software for OS/2 and Macintosh.andP;  Theydon't make as much money on Mac Pluses and PS/2 Model 25s.andM;Another catch here is that anybody who doesn't have some kind of computeravailable is really behind it.andP;  So charlatans can sell these computerphobicsouls on the idea that there's a single way to make computers easy.andP;  Bunk.andM;Computers take some learning.andP;  Many choose not to devote time to it.andP;  ButWindows, Macintosh and Presentation Manager won't appreciably shave the timeneeded to learn how to get out a letter.andM;Time after time, we see that what we do with computers is communicate, mostlyby writing.andP;  But it's not easier to write when most edits call for multiplemouse actions and the screen is substantially slowed by unnecessary graphicsoverhead.andM;I've tried some Windows programs that were unacceptably slow on an 8-MHz ATcompatible and barely fast enough on a 25-MHz 80386.andP;  This is progress?andM;UNIX no doubt needs a front end.andP;  Otherwise it's limited to the true computeraddicts and convoluted syntax lovers.andM;But give me a character-driven menu shell around MS-DOS.andP;  I don't have totype in all the paths and command syntax.andP;  The program does it for me.andP;  But Ican do it fast on my old 1983 model Compaq Portable with modified CGAgraphics.andP;  And I can pick one I like that works the way I want.andM;There are a lot of neat character-driven alternatives to let users launchprograms from menus and perform MS-DOS functions from menu choices.andM;Desqview from Quarterdeck Office Systems in Santa Monica, Calif., has thesefeatures as well as multitasking and memory management, while allowing foroptional desk accessories.andM;PC Tools from Central Point Software in Beaverton, Ore., has scads of otherfeatures such as disk fixing, desk accessories and backup, but does a greatjob as a front end on even the lowliest PCs.andM;A lot of users we talk to are using these two programs to great effect.andO;Desqview is gaining some currency around our offices, but it doesn't thrilleverybody.andM;That's one of the things wrong with Windows and Macintosh -- theone-size-fits-all theory of computing.andP;  Why strive for software homogeneitywhen the people running, and applications running on, the computers are asdifferent as can be?andM;Some people think every computer and program should look the same whetherthey are efficient and sensible or not.andP;  These same people probably havethree different kinds of athletic shoes for each different sport they do.andM;Do I miss those three-dimensional buttons on the screen in Windows or thelittle bomb that appears when you find a Mac operating system flaw?andP;  No.andP;  I'mgetting some work done.andM;Rick Vizachero is GCN's assistant managing editor for technical coverage.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
