Nonetheless, the audience'sresponse to one comment left me startled -- and reminded me once again of howdeep-seated is the Democrats' dilemma.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BAD NEWS CAN BE GOOD NEWS FOR THE DEMOCRATS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Points of View; Jeff Greenfield is a political and media columnist.  </MEMO><TEXT>     What, a questioner asked, would George Bush be remembered for in thehistory books?;   Well, suggested Time magazine's Michael Kramer, maybe he'llbe remembered as the man who presided over the Second Great AmericanDepression.;   And the audience broke out into sustained applause.;   Now itis possible that the audience was simply applauding Kramer's perspicacity.But, in the immortal words of Homey the Clown, I don't think so.;   I believethey were cheering the prospects of a calamity sufficiently severe that itwould undermine President Bush's prospects for re-election. More important,that anticipation of economic disaster seems to be the foundation on whichmost Democrats are basing their 1992 hopes. As a state party chairman put itearlier this year, &quot;You have to remember that bad news is good news for us.&quot;;  Now it is not exactly unheard of for a challenging party or candidate topaint a portrait of the way things are in somber shades.;   The 1952Republican campaign theme was &quot;Korea, Corruption and Communism&quot; -- shorthandindictments of the Truman administration's policies. John Kennedy based muchof his 1960 campaign on a (non-existent) missile gap, and on the assertionthat the United States was losing a worldwide race for power and influence tothe Soviet Union.;   In 1980, Ronald Reagan mocked the Carter administration'srosy view of the economy by saying, &quot;Recession is when your neighbor loses hisjob; depression is when you lose your job; and recovery is when Jimmy Carterloses his job.&quot;;   In each of these campaigns, however, something else lay atthe heart of the victorious battles by the &quot;out&quot; party: a sense that they knewhow to take control of the future.;   For Eisenhower, it was his World War IIleadership that would bring a just peace in Korea. For Kennedy, it was hisgenerational outlook that would provide the energy and wisdom to find the jobsand schools and ideas needed for new times. For Reagan, it was a bedrock faithin conservative principles that provided a basis for optimism -- indeed,Reagan's upbeat assertion that &quot;America's best days are before us&quot; provided animportant balance to his gloomy view of the U.S. economy.;   It is thatcounterbalance that the Democratic Party desperately needs to communicate.Clearly, the economic news is bad: The Federal Reserve Board chairman says theeconomy has turned &quot;sluggish&quot; in recent months; consumer confidence is at arecord low; last year's deficit hit $260 billion, and this year's deficit willdwarf that; retailers are facing the key Christmas season the way childrenwatch horror movies: peeking through their fingers covering their eyes.;   Noris this bad news confined to the blue collar sectors of the economy. Law firmsare laying off associates; restaurants and nightclubs are hurting badly; theworld of big media, from TV stations and networks to newspapers to magazinesto advertising agencies, is reeling from shrinking business.;   What thismeans is that the Democrats have a chance to make their case for change. Butthat case cannot rest simply on the recitation of bad news. Voters know thatalready.;   What they want to know is whether there is any reason to trust theDemocrats with their economic fortunes. After all, the last time they did theygot an industrial depression and double-digit inflation.;   What vision mightthey respond to? Sen. Tom Harkin's traditional populist liberalism? Gov. BillClinton's &quot;reciprocal responsibility&quot; theme, emphasizing what government andcitizens owe to each other? Sen. Bob Kerrey's less substantive, more poeticgenerational theme? Something yet to come from Mario &quot;Hamlet on the Hudson&quot;Cuomo?;   The source of this brighter vision is uncertain. The necessity forit is absolutely certain. Because the blunt fact is that the Democrats have soundermined themselves as a party that can lead, that bad news is simply notenough to put it back in power.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Jeff Greenfield column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911103  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  745  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, November 3, 199100308253,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
