Officer Candidate School demonstrated to Mr. Cadwalader how effectively the Marine Corps succeeded in remolding young men into its own image. In the isolation of the training camp, the rules and standards of civilian life, of college or of buddies in the old neighborhood no longer applied. Recruits were forced to readjust to an entirely new set of values. The rules of the game were entirely new, and everyone was ultimately driven by the desire to be rewarded by even a crumb of approval from the omnipotent, impossible-to-satisfy drill sergeant.    Years later, after his military career was cut short by an enemy mine in Vietnam, Mr. Cadwalader got the idea that the underlying principle of Marine OCS might be an effective way of redeeming delinquent boys -- not, of course, by promoting a warrior spirit, which the kids had more than enough of already, but by isolating them from their criminal world and its insidious values and role models and exposing them to a new community that they themselves would build and maintain, where the harshness of island life demanded a fellowship of commitment and where &quot;honesty ranked above deceit, self-reliance above preying on others, and compassion above the ability to inspire fear.&quot;    In an education community in which failure often is covered up or minimized and in which leaders from Education Secretary Bennett on down keep insisting that we &quot;know what works&quot; with youngsters, &quot;Castaways&quot; offers a refreshing insight into the complexities of the real world. Mr. Cadwalader found that the principle that worked spectacularly for the Marines largely washed out on Penikese. And the great strength of Mr. Cadwalader's account is the penetrating honesty with which he examines and evaluates his efforts to &quot;do some good&quot; and his innocence about the demons that drive bad boys.    The profoundly disturbed boys referred to Penikese by the state Department of Youth Services were a species apart from the &quot;romanticized image&quot; of the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; Huck Finn delinquent who could be straightened out by loving and firm guidance, useful and wholesome activities, and a clear opportunity to turn one's life around. The school usually got the most difficult-to-place kids. Some had invested too much of their fragile self-esteem in their delinquent image to be willing to surrender it. Others had been defeated so often that they could not believe in the reality of success and found a perverse satisfaction in seeing themselves as perpetual victims of sinister forces. Most lived for the moment and found it difficult to defer pleasure or endure hardship for some distant payoff. Ripping off the system in one way or another had become second nature to them -- &quot;their way of life.&quot;    But these &quot;explanations&quot; are not offered to pigeonhole the boys into this or that neat category. &quot;Castaways&quot; is a meditation on the mystery and complexity of the dark side of human behavior. No reader, for example, is likely to remain unmoved by the harrowing monologue in which Mr. Cadwalader tries to capture the thinking of the unknown boy who one night systematically broke the legs of all the chickens they were raising. Particularly impressive is the enormous amount of time, effort and thought that Mr. Cadwalader gave to each of his boys. He takes the reader with him in his perceptive, closely reasoned and convincing analyses of individual cases. However, in the end, in most cases, we are faced with the sobering reality that each boy harbors some dark secret that has eluded the logic of our wisdom and compassion.    And Mr. Cadwalader is not afraid to face tough questions. Might it not, for example, be better to practice a kind of social triage by locking up the incorrigibles and spending available resources on those who have a chance at rehabilitation? But the rub is that there is no profile of the ideal candidate for his program; there are no patterns, he argues &quot;that would enable us to identify candidates who had better-than-average chances for success.&quot;    When Mr. Cadwalader and his colleagues took stock and did a study in 1980, they concluded that they could claim that they had &quot;turned around&quot; only 16 of the 106 boys who had gone through their program -- a far cry from the huge success rates of &quot;breakthrough&quot; approaches that periodically are hyped in the media. But then Mr. Cadwalader doesn't believe in magical breakthroughs, and he is suspicious of alleged outstanding results that suggest there are readily available, surefire &quot;cures.&quot;    I doubt if many readers will judge Mr. Cadwalader as harshly as he does himself. It isn't only that he was dealing with some of society's most intractable problems. There's also the mounting evidence -- in dropout rates and test results -- that we don't do all that much better in motivating and engaging &quot;normal&quot; youngsters in regular schools. &quot;Castaways&quot; is far more sophisticated than most education studies in probing the mystery of the learning process. It is also a reminder of how much we have yet to learn.    ---   Mr. Shanker is president of the American Federation of Teachers. </TEXT></DOC>
