Her parents sued the physician, alleging negligence. They settled for damages of #3,500 ($6,300) -- less than their legal costs but the maximum court award.    &quot;My barrister says in the United States, I would have gotten $1 million for the same damages,&quot; observes Paul Hayter, the child's father and a Hampshire surveyor. &quot;To get a pittance . . . is inhuman.&quot; English justice, he adds, &quot;just isn't fair.&quot;    But hefty awards for victims of medical mishaps, defective products and disasters soon may become more common in England. Its antiquated civil-justice system is heading for a shake-up. In a report out tomorrow, a government judicial panel probably will decry the system's sluggishness and propose ways to make civil justice swifter and fairer.    The overhaul, perhaps the most far-reaching since Charles Dickens satirized the system in the 1850s, largely results from growing public clamor for a U.S.style approach to personal-injury cases.    For the first time, England could have class-action suits and a form of contingency fees as well as significantly higher damages. (In class actions, groups of plaintiffs with similar complaints band together. With contingency fees, a lawyer keeps a portion of a successful award -- but receives nothing if the case fails.)    The likely upshot: more litigation and legal expenses for major corporations, British and foreign alike. &quot;This is bound to have a bottom-line impact on manufacturers and their insurers,&quot; warns David McIntosh. He was chief outside counsel for Eli Lilly andamp; Co. in a string of recent suits here over Oraflex, the arthritis medicine that the big U.S. drug maker withdrew from the market.    The Lilly suits, settled in January, aroused much of the present furor. About 500 plaintiffs appeared ready to drop their cases until a British property tycoon offered to help foot their legal bills. The company's nearly #3 million settlement of the 1,300 health-damage claims also outraged some of the Oraflex plaintiffs. At less than #2,400 a claimant, the offer represented far less than the $6 million a U.S. jury awarded one Georgia man whose mother died after she took the drug. (Lilly later settled for a confidential sum in return for dropping its appeal of the 1983 jury award.)    Greater compensation awards here could encourage similar moves by other countries and slow American drug manufacturers' practice of marketing new products overseas first. &quot;As more of the world starts granting greater worth to human lives, the ante is going to go up for drug companies,&quot; predicts Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group. &quot;There will be more caution before dumping {new} drugs on the market.&quot;    In England, larger awards could arise from the introduction of class-action suits. A class-action bill sponsored by the Conservative government would allow even middle-class consumers involved in such litigation to receive government legal aid, which is usually limited to the less affluent. The measure has cleared the House of Lords and should win final parliamentary passage by early August.    A bipartisan consumer campaign, launched last month and led by a respected jurist and a veteran health activist, seeks broader legislative remedies. For instance, organizers want to create a court advisory board that would set higher compensation levels, giving greater emphasis to victims' pain and suffering and their loss of quality of life. The idea could attract wide support in Parliament, following a bill's introduction this fall.    But the campaigners' push for limited contingency fees, now outlawed in England, will stir a fierce fight. Many personal-injury victims either don't bring suits or quickly accept bargain settlements because protracted, failed litigation can ruin them financially. Losers must pay their lawyers' charges as well as the other side's. Contingency fees &quot;could well work in the interests of getting justice for people who don't have deep pockets,&quot; says Michael Grylls, an influential Tory member of Parliament.    Doctors disagree. &quot;We know it {contingency fees} leads to ambulance chasing and inflated damages,&quot; asserts John Havard, a barrister and secretary of the politically powerful British Medical Association. &quot;You'll get more of a United States-type situation, with huge sums for pain and suffering.&quot;    Some lawyer groups suggest a middle ground: a contingency fund, which would pay the costs of unsuccessful cases by keeping a portion of successful litigants' damages. The contingency fund idea may be embraced by the Lord Chancellor's Civil Justice Review Committee, whose report tomorrow marks the 36th scrutiny of civil courts during this century.    Whatever reforms do emerge, the English civil-justice system will remain a different breed from its American cousin. Lawyers usually don't seek damages for medical care here because of the essentially free National Health Service. And the lack of juries in personal-injury suits means even higher damage awards probably won't match the multimillion-dollar ones in the U.S.    The Confederation of British Industry, Britain's leading employer group, plans a late summer conference on how businesses should grapple with the coming overhaul of personal-injury litigation. Industry nevertheless &quot;shouldn't be fearful of people bringing {additional} actions when mistakes are few and far between,&quot; argues Norman Rose, the confederation's senior attorney.    Mr. McIntosh, Lilly's outside counsel, is aghast. He thinks the employer group should join the fray now because &quot;the changes are inevitable and consequential.&quot; He vows he will single-handedly fight &quot;emotionally motivated consumerists. They will do more harm than good.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
