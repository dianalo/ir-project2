This problem solution is basedon the fact that for non-relativistic electron Fermi-gas ({gamma}=5/3),stability of ratio between chemical potential and the temperature proceedsfrom entropy conservation condition. This ratio serves as a parameterin the parametrically assigned Fermi-gas state equation.</TEXT></DOC>
