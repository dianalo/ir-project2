Supreme Court.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>If you hire contract programmers, documentation writers, or other &quot;work forhire&quot; employees, this summer the Supreme Court may have handed you a tickingtime bomb.andP;  Unless you have a contract that calls for an explicit transfer ofcopyright ownership, says the Court, the intellectual property you bought maynot belong to you.andM;That's pretty much the bottom line of a landmark case, picturesquely titledCommunity for Creative Non-Violence v.andP;  Reid, that the Supreme Court decidedin June.andP;  The Reid case finally clarifies a murky area of law: Who owns therights to works produced by people who fall somewhere between regularemployees and independent contractors? There's never been much ambiguityabout copyright ownership at either end of the spectrum: Property created byfull-fledged employees has always belonged to the employer, while workscreated by arms-length contractors (independent developers, free-lancewriters and artists, code library vendors, etc.) has belonged clearly to theoriginal author.andM;But copyright ownership blurs when companies bring in outside specialists whofunction as quasi-employees--a situation that's especially common in softwaredevelopment.andP;  Many companies have tried to write so-called &quot;work for hire&quot;contracts that transfer copyright ownership, but these contracts have atendency to fall apart in court (at least four different federal courts havewrestled with work-for-hire cases recently, significantly adding to theconfusion).andP;  Now the Supreme Court has issued a definitive formula thatsimply eliminates the whole notion of de facto employees.andP;  According to theCourt, companies own only the work of people who are genuine employees;everything else is up for grabs.andM;How does the Court's new ruling affect software developers who hirefree-lancers and contract programmers? &quot;Most companies go by a rule ofthumb--if they pay for it, they own it,&quot; says Anne Fontaine, an intellectualproperty rights lawyer who has watched the Reid case closely.andP;  &quot;That's not aprinciple that holds true any more.andP;  Independent contractors now probablyhold a few more marbles.&quot;andM;Fontaine points out that it's still possible for an employer to acquire fullcopyright ownership from an independent contractor, but now the courts willprobably look for evidence of an explicit copyright sale.andP;  &quot;The advice we'regiving our clients,&quot; she says, &quot;is to write a separate assignment ofcopyright contract that's particular for each work, so that it appears thatan actual bargaining process took place.&quot; Handshake deals, open-endedassignments, and boilerplate clauses in generalpurpose contracts now may bean invitation to a lawsuit, she notes.andM;'The Court's decision makes the actual hiring and contracting process morecomplicated,&quot; Fontaine adds.andP;  &quot;still, it's a good decision becauseandM;there's finally a fairly definitive rule.andP;  That's an improvement.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
