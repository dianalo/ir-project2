The case seems to break new ground in determining who canbe charged with insider trading, since it apparently is thefirst to accuse a doctor of trading on confidentialinformation from a patient. The case also is one of the firstto apply a federal appeals-court decision two weeks ago,involving stockbroker Robert Chestman, that restricted thescope of insider-trading laws. The federal judge in New Yorksaid that even under the guidelines of the Chestman decision,the charges against the psychiatrist, Robert Howard Willis,shouldn't be dropped.</LP><TEXT>   Dr. Willis is charged with buying the stock in early 1986after learning that Sanford Weill, former chief executiveofficer of Shearson Loeb Rhodes, was seeking to becomeBankAmerica's chief executive officer. Previously, courtdocuments have identified the patient as &quot;Jane Doe,&quot; who wasupset because her husband would have to move if Mr. Weilltook the job. Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, in her writtendecision, however, disclosed that the patient is Mr. Weill'swife.   Dr. Willis argued that the charges against him should bedropped because he violated no fiduciary duty in allegedlytrading on the information. He also claimed that under theChestman decision he needed to have been specifically toldthat the information was confidential. Dr. Willis, chargedwith 46 counts of securities fraud and mail fraud, is accusedof making a profit of $27,475 on the transactions.   Judge Cedarbaum, however, ruled that because of thetradition of physician-patient confidentiality, Dr. Willisshould have known from the start that any information gleanedfrom Mrs. Weill was to remain secret. She also said thatallegations against Dr. Willis amounted to theft of valuableinformation from Mrs. Weill.   &quot;It is difficult to imagine a relationship that requires ahigher degree of trust and confidence than the traditionalrelationship of physician and patient,&quot; Judge Cedarbaum said.Unlike circumstances in the Chestman case, where thedefendant wasn't informed that a stock tip he received wasconfidential, Judge Cedarbaum said Dr. Willis knew he wasreceiving information in confidence from Mrs. Weill.   Judge Cedarbaum also said the alleged insider tradingdefrauded Mrs. Weill in two ways. First, she had an interestin Mr. Weill's possible advancement at BankAmerica, which thejudge said could have been jeopardized by disclosure of theinformation. Second, the judge said, Mrs. Weill &quot;had aproperty interest in a continuing course of psychiatrictreatment. . . . Dr. Willis's disclosures jeopardized thepsychiatrict-patient relationship and put at risk thepatient's financial investment in psychiatric treatment.&quot;   Mr. Weill currently is chairman of Primerica Corp.   Edward Brodsky, a lawyer for Dr. Willis, said he believedthat under the Chestman case, the charges against Dr. Willisshould have been dropped. Also, he said, Dr. Willis didn'tviolate the type of fiduciary responsibility that is requiredfor there to have been a securities-law violation. &quot;Patientconfidentiality doesn't extend to securities law,&quot; he said.   ---   RED SQUIRRELS won't stand in the way of Arizonaobservatory, court says.   In a decision that some environmentalists fear may weakenthe federal Endangered Species Act, the 9th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals overturned a ruling that had suspended aUniversity of Arizona plan to build the $200 millionobservatory on Arizona's Mount Graham. But the SanFrancisco-based appeals court said the stay on constructioncould be reinstated if evidence emerges of a threat to the180 red squirrels that live on the mountain.   Congress initially authorized the project on the basis ofa U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report that found that theobservatory wouldn't significantly harm the squirrels. TwoFish and Wildlife Service officials later said in depositionsthat they had suppressed their misgivings about the project.&quot;The government biologists wanted to say there was danger tothe squirrels, but politics got in the way,&quot; said BrockEvans, vice president of national issues at the NationalAudubon Society, one of the plaintiffs in the case.   Environmentalists have expressed concern that the court'sdecision reflects an unwillingness to reverse congressionalapproval for a project even though some of the evidence mayhave been fraudulent or erroneous. A spokesman for theMaricopa Audubon Society in Arizona said the courteffectively sides with those &quot;who have said the project'sgoing to continue no matter what, regardless of what Congresssaid about their intentions to not weaken the EndangeredSpecies Act.&quot;   Plaintiffs' lawyers wouldn't comment on the decision,saying the judge instructed the parties not to discuss thespecifics of the case.   John Moag, a lawyer representing the university from theBaltimore office of Patton, Boggs andamp; Blow, said Congressclosely followed the guidelines of the Endangered Species Act&quot;in balancing the purposes of the project against thepossible negative impact&quot; on the squirrels. The universityhad argued that its monitoring and feeding of the squirrelswould reduce the possibility of extinction. &quot;I think we'regoing to be an integral factor in this squirrel's survival,&quot;Mr. Moag said.   A red squirrel is named as a plaintiff in the case,although &quot;no one actually suggested that the squirrel shouldappear in court,&quot; according to a University of Arizonaspokesman.   ---   CENSORSHIP SUIT challenges ban on filming of &quot;Bonfire&quot;scene in courtroom.   The suit involves the decision by New Jersey Chief JusticeRobert Wilentz preventing a production crew from filming ascene from &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; in an Essex Countycourthouse in Newark. Judge Wilentz said in his ruling thatthe scene showing a group of black citizens rioting &quot;couldserve to seriously undermine the confidence of black citizensin our court system.&quot;   In the lawsuit filed yesterday in federal court in Newark,Essex County Executive Nicholas R. Amato and the countyalleged that the judge had acted as a censor in violation ofthe First Amendment. A spokesman for Judge Wilentz said hecouldn't comment on pending litigation.   Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. unit, which is producingthe film based on the novel by Tom Wolfe, had agreed todonate $250,000 to the courthouse-restoration fund for theuse of the courtroom. Ultimately the scene was filmed in thecourthouse in Queens, N.Y.   &quot;The county has historically used court buildings for thefilming of movies as a revenue source. We want to get thegroundwork laid on how much control the chief justice hasover filming in county-owned property,&quot; said H. CurtisMeanor, Essex County counsel.   Mr. Meanor said the county will seek to recoup the lostfee from the state judiciary as monetary damages.   ---   FAT BOYS rap group wins right to sue Miller Brewing Co.over commercial.   In federal court in Manhattan, N.Y., Judge Charles Haightrejected a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which claims that acommercial featuring Joe Piscopo and imitators of therap-music group infringes on the group's copyrights andtrademarks. The defendants, who also include Mr. Piscopo andthe advertising firm Backer andamp; Spielvogel, argued that thecase should be thrown out because the commercial was a parodyof the rap group's style, rather than a ripoff of the group'swork.   Judge Haight said the commercial wasn't protected asparody, however, because its &quot;use is entirely for profit: tosell beer.&quot; The judge said that based on previous cases,&quot;appropriation of copyrighted material solely for personalprofit, unrelieved by any creative purpose, cannot constituteparody as a matter of law.&quot;   Judge Haight, however, did throw out a part of the lawsuitcharging that the commercial defamed the group, whose membersare all under 21. They claimed that their reputations werehurt and business prospects damaged because the commercialimplied that they promoted the drinking of alcoholicbeverages by minors. The judge said the look-alike group'sbehavior in the ad was unlikely to be seen as an endorsementof under-age drinking.   Lawyers for the defendants couldn't be reached forcomment.   ---   Amy Dockser Marcus contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
