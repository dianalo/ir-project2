The obtained solidswere exposed to different doses of {gamma}-irradiation ranging between10-80 Mrad. The change in residual microstrain, lattice parameter andcrystallite size due to the irradiation process were investigated byX-ray diffraction analyses. The results revealed that {gamma}-irradiationeffected important changes in the structural characteristics of NiO lattice.No detectable change was observed for the crystallite size of NiO-400/sup0/C; however, the crystallite size of NiO-600/sup 0/C decreased by increasingthe dose up to 20 Mrad and increased at higher doses but still remainingsmaller than that measured for the unirradiated specimen. The latticeparameters of NiO preheated at 400 or 600/sup 0/C were found to increaseas a function of the dose. These results were attributed to progressiveremoval of Ni/sup 3+/ ions acting as lattice defects in NiO solid. Themicrostrains in NiO specimens precalcined either at 400 or 600/sup 0/Cwere found to decrease progressively by increasing the dose falling tominimum values at doses of 40 and 80 Mrad for the solids preheated at600 and 400/sup 0/C, respectively. The augmentation of the exposure doseabove 40 Mrad for NiO-600/sup 0/C resulted in an increase in microstrainwhich, however, remained always smaller than those found for the unirradiatedsolid. The strain-relief in NiO-600/sup 0/C due to {gamma}-irradiationtook place, mainly, via splitting of its crystallites. On the other hand,the progressive removal of lattice defects (Ni/sup 3+/ ions) due to theirradiation process might account for the observed strain-relief in NiO-400/sup0/C.</TEXT></DOC>
