Prices of some actively traded long-term government bonds fell less than 1/4 point, or just under $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Prices of many corporate, municipal and mortgage-backed bonds also slipped, while rates on some money market instruments edged higher as major banks raised their prime rates to 10% from 9 1/2%.    Mounting unsold dealer inventories of new Treasury 3-year and 10-year notes auctioned earlier in the week also contributed to the market slide, said Joseph Petri, president of Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc.    &quot;The participation of Japanese investors and traders in the ($22 billion) note auctions was less than expected, probably because of the discount rate increase,&quot; he said.    The half-point increase in the U.S. discount rate Tuesday to 6 1/2% prompted a sell-off in the Japanese government bond market, where yields surged to their highest levels this year. &quot;All of a sudden, on a relative value basis, our bonds looked less attractive next to the Japanese bonds,&quot; Mr. Petri said.    While many analysts say the Federal Reserve appears to be committed to restraining inflation pressures, they aren't optimistic that the bear market in bonds will end soon.    &quot;Maybe the Fed will be successful in bringing the rate of inflation down,&quot; said Gordon Pye, chief economist at Irving Trust Co. &quot;But I think long-term government bond yields,&quot; now approaching 9.40% on the most recent issues, &quot;are in a steady upward progression. I would not be surprised if these yields hit 12% before the trend is over,&quot; he said.    Mortgage-Backed Securities   Adjustable-rate mortgage securities have been under pressure during the past week because the sharp rise in short-term rates has left investors with below-market returns for now.    Key issues such as Fannie Mae securities that float monthly at 125 basis points above the 11th district cost-of-funds index and Freddie Mac securities that float yearly at 175 basis points above the one-year Treasury index are down about 5/8 point this week.    The Fannie Mae securities are trading at about 99 3/4, and the Freddie Mac issue, with an initial rate for a year of 8.75%, is now at 99 1/8.    The problem for investors in Fannie Mae cost-of-funds adjustable-rate securities, which float off a thrift deposit index compiled by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, is that the index, which stood at 7.62% in June, lags behind market rates.    While bad for investors, this tendency is welcomed by homeowners with 11th district mortgages. The 11th district index is unchanged since January, while the three-month London interbank offered rate is up about 150 basis points to nearly 8 3/4%, and the one-year Treasury bill is up about 130 basis points at 8.20%.    The Fannie Mae securities are under pressure because investors have to wait until the 11th district moves up to the market rate, which could take at least several months.    The Freddie Mac securities have dropped because investors have to wait a year to receive market rates on their holdings, and because there's a danger that next year's rate could be below market because of the annual rate caps on the securities.    In the pass-through market Thursday, Ginnie Maes and other mortgage issues were down 1/8 to 1/4 point after moderate trading.    Among active issues, August Ginnie Mae 9% securities were quoted at 92 3/4, down 1/4; 10% securities at 98 3/4, down 1/8; and Freddie Mac 10% securities at 98 2/32, off 1/8.    The Ginnie Mae 10% bonds were yielding 10.32% to a 12-year average life, as the spread to the when-issued 10-year note widened one basis point to 99 basis points.    Treasury Securities   In yesterday's activity, the price of the Treasury's latest 30-year bond fell to 97 3/8 from 97 18/32 Wednesday. The yield increased to 9.39% from 9.37%. The government's 10-year notes fell to 97 15/32 from 97 25/32 to yield 9.33%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 0.60 point to 1198.24. The index ranged between 1203.22 and 1193.57.    Among short-term interest rates, the discount yield on new three-month Treasury bills was unchanged at 7% bid. On six-month bills, the discount yield rose to 7.43% from 7.39%. The rate on fed funds averaged 8.16%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.). On Wednesday, the rate averaged 7.80%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.    Yesterday, the Treasury sold $7.02 billion of 248-day cash management bills at an average yield of 7.73%.    Here are the results of the auction:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

Foreign Bonds   British, Japanese and West German government bonds were little changed in quiet trading.   The cloud of a possible discount rate increase by the Bank of Japan, in the wake of a similar move by the U.S., continued to hang over the Japanese market. The benchmark 5% No. 105 bond due 1997 closed at a yield of 5.375% in the interdealer market, up half a basis point on the day. The range on the session was 5.305% to 5.38%, as a morning rally sputtered out. The closing yield represents a price of 97.67 yen, down 0.03 yen.   Gilts, or British government bonds, ended unchanged to down 1/8, as a steady performance by U.S. Treasury bonds and a rise in sterling helped lift the market from earlier lows. The benchmark U.K. Treasury 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007, which had fallen as low as 115 15/32 earlier in the session, ended unchanged at 115 25/32 to yield 9.69%.   The dollar's slight easing and the quiet U.S. Treasury market limited trading of mark bonds, with most government bonds ending flat, while some Euromark issues rose as much as 1/4 point on the day. The West German government's 6 1/2% bonds due 1998 ended yielding 6.832% at 97.65 bid, off 0.05 point from Wednesday's interbank close, when Bonn's 10-year benchmark yielded 6.825%.   Municipal Issues   Municipal bonds ended as much as 5/8 point weaker after tumbling municipal futures dragged the market lower in the afternoon.   The drop in cash municipals marked one of the first times in weeks that the tax-exempt marketplace underperformed the Treasury market on a down day.   The bout of weakness was caused by a number of factors, including a lower dollar, soft Treasury market and an overflow of concerns raised by the Federal Reserve's recent discount rate increase.   But the kicker was a rapid downturn in municipal futures that saw the September contract touch an intraday low of more than a point below Wednesday's settlement before rebounding to settle 24/32 lower at 86-30.   Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices tracked Treasury bonds, finishing the day generally unchanged to off 1/8 point in late dealings.   On the new-issue front, the Student Loan Marketing Association launched $200 million of 12-year notes at par to yield 9.80%, a spread of 45 basis points above the rate of the Treasury 10-year note. Salomon Brothers Inc. underwrote the issue.</TEXT></DOC>
