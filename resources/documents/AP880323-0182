Tight security segregated the international press corps of about150 journalists and most the 2,000 residents of this town about 90miles from Managua on the Costa Rican border.   The delegations met in the main customs house at the bordercrossing, the only building big enough for the talks.   Covering the negotiations, which began Monday, has meant hoursof waiting punctuated by frenzied activity. Whenever negotiatorsleave the customs house, cross the blacktop road and mount amakeshift stage, photographers shove and push for position aswriters grab for pens and notebooks.   Otherwise, the press waits in the constant wind blowing off LakeManagua, said to harbor the world's only freshwater sharks.   Some reporters meandered down to the lake. Others went to SanJuan del Sur to work on their tans. One slept in a hammock tied toa utility pole.   But most passed the time chatting, reading, writing or sippingbeer bought with U.S. dollars, Costa Rican colones or Nicaraguancordobas from a snack bar the government set up in a storage room.   Another room held the phones for international calls thegovernment had installed for the talks. Payment _ in U.S. dollars _had to be on the spot.</TEXT><TEXT>   The Contra delegation is staying in Liberia, Costa Rica, about37 miles miles away.   They arrive each day in a pale green schoolbus with smokedwindows accompanied by Costa Rican and Sandinista security agentsand with Contra fighters in U.S.-made fatigues flanking the leaderof the delegation, Alfredo Cesar.   Nicaragua's state-run Radio Sandino, which is heard here, refersto the Contras as the ``delegation of the U.S. government.'' RadioImpacto, a U.S.-financed station in Costa Rica that broadcasts theContra point of view, can also be picked up in Sapoa.   The Sandinista delegation, headed by Defense Minister HumbertoOrtega, arrives in four-wheel drive vehicles with motorcycleescorts. The Sandinistas are staying in San Juan del Sur, a beachtown on the Pacific Ocean about 10 miles away.   One report said phone lines there were cut as a security measure.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sandinista security has been tight along the PanAmericanHighway, but the border crossing itself has stayed open throughoutthe talks.   Journalists are searched by state security agents and issuedcredentials each day at a site about a mile away, then bused to thescene of the talks, a complex of customs buildings next to thevillage.   Most of the area is closed to reporters, roped off by securityagents. The governnment set up a covered press area outdoors,across a road from the customs house.</TEXT></DOC>
