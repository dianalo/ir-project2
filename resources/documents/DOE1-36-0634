<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-36-0634 </DOCNO><TEXT>The results of a measurement of the /sup 139/La(n,n'{gamma})/sup 139/Lareaction are presented for incident-neutron energies ranging from 1.3MeV to 2.7 MeV. The levels and the decay scheme of the /sup 139/La nucleuswere determined. Spin and parity assignements are proposed on the basisof extensive comparisons of measured excitation functions with predictionsof the statistical theory of the compound nucleus. Our results are comparedwith those reported in the literature.</TEXT></DOC>
