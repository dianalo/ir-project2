The release of the elderly, grizzled man came after thehijackers resumed talks with Algerian mediators on ending the10-day-old crisis.   The man, dressed in a white robe, descended from the KuwaitAirways Boeing 747 at 9:45 p.m. (3:45 EDT), got into a car and wasdriven across the tarmac to the VIP lounge at Houari BoumedienneAirport.   Algerian officials said he was a Kuwaiti named Djuma AbdallahChatti.   ``Praise to God, I am fine, but they had me tied all the timeand I am tired,'' said Chatti, who gave his age as 70.   ``They are not good people,'' he told reporters in the airportlounge. ``They beat me.''   At least 30 hostages remained on board the plane seized April 5on a Bangkok-Kuwait flight.   The hijackers first diverted the plane to northern Iran. It flewthree days later to Larnaca, Cyprus, where Palestine LiberationOrganization officials negotiated with the hijackers. The gunmenhave killed two passengers and freed 71. Among the remaininghostages are three members of Kuwait's royal family.   After the latest release, the hijackers broadcast a message tothe control tower in Arabic and English, repeating their demand forthe release of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists jailed in Kuwait.   The statement said Chatti had been released for ``strictlyhumanitarian reasons.''   ``We repeat forcefully our demands for the liberation of our 17brothers in Kuwait, and we will not go back on them even if theprice we have to pay is very high,'' the statement said.   Kuwait's deputy foreign minister, Mohammed Al-Osaimi, reiteratedthat the 17 would not be freed. He is head of a high-level Kuwaitidelegation on the scene.   Another Kuwaiti official, speaking to reporters on condition henot be identified, said the Algerian authorities continued to putpressure on Kuwait to be more flexible in its position.   ``You can see this from the fact that they are telling us thatthe ball is in our court,'' the official said.   Negotiations between the hijackers and Algerian mediatorsresumed Thursday evening after a breakdown earlier in the daycaused by the lack of progress, according to the official Algeriannews agency.   In Washington, lawmakers urged Secretary of State George P.Shultz to intervene because of reports that one of the hijackersmight be responsible for kidnapping American journalist TerryAnderson in Lebanon.   Kuwait's independent al-Qabas newspaper reported Wednesday thatthe alleged kidnapper, Imad Mughniyeh, was believed to have boardedthe plane when it landed in Mashhad, Iran.   Mughniyeh has been identified as one of the security chiefs inBeirut for Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed to be theumbrella organization for pro-Iranian groups holding foreignhostages in Lebanon.   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat accused Iran of being behind thehijacking and said some of the gunmen ``belong to the Iraniangovernment.'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid echoedArafat's comments Thursday in Cairo.   In a radio call to the airport tower Thursday, a passenger whoidentified himself as Ahmed Zayed said: ``I ask my government torelease the 17 Islamic Jihad prisoners. If not, they will kill usall.''   Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, is the group that holds Anderson,and it also is demanding the release of the 17 Kuwaiti prisoners.Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,was kidnapped March 16, 1985. He has been held longer than any ofthe 22 foreign hostages in Lebanon.   The hijackers, said to be armed with grenades and guns, havethreatened to blow up the plane and kill their remaining hostagesif their demands are not met.   A ranking Algerian official said Wednesday that Kuwait's``intransigence'' had created the standstill.   Algeria's negotiating committee is divided into two teams led byInterior Minister Hedi Khediri. One team is responsible forcontacts with the Kuwaitis, and the other with the hijackers.   A doctor was allowed on board the plane Thursday to examine thehostages.   ``I saw no sign of any illness that required hospitalization ormajor medicine,'' said Dr. Youssef Mahdi. He later told theofficial Algerian news agency that he prescribed some ``routinemedicines'' that would be sent to the plane.   ``The passengers I saw did not have their hands tied anddisplayed no signs of physical violence,'' Mahdi said.   An airport crew also went aboard to clean up and serve hot food,the Algerian official said.   In a letter Wednesday to Shultz, Sen. Daniel Moynihan and Rep.Louise Slaughter, both New York Democrats, wrote: ``We know theUnited States is not a primary party to the Algiers negotiations.But if Terry Anderson's chief kidnapper is on the Kuwaiti jet, theUnited States government must ensure that the negotiators are awareof this fact.''   ``It would be a travesty for Imad Mughniyeh to go free whileTerry Anderson remains a captive,'' they said.   The plane landed in Algeria on Tuesday night.   It was moved early Thursday to the end of the runway so anotherjet could land. It was later returned to its original positionabout 400 yards from the terminal.</TEXT></DOC>
