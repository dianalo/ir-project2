This past July 1, four years to the dayafter the Bork nomination, many of the same groups went intohigh gear when President Bush nominated another conservative.Will Clarence Thomas also die the death of a thousandinterest groups?   &quot;We're going to Bork him,&quot; Florence Kennedy said of NOW'sgame plan. &quot;We're going to kill him politically. . . . Thislittle creep, where did he come from?&quot; The script calls forthrowing up endless smears; if there's enough smoke, there'san excuse. Recall how Alabama Sen. Howell Heflin explainedthat he voted against Mr. Bork because &quot;He had a strangelifestyle.&quot; Senators representing the liberal plantation mustsee a conservative black as the very definition of a strangelifestyle. The attempted smears so far:                                                                                                          He's Catholic. Judge Thomas's Catholic upbringing is codefor the assumption that he finds no constitutional right toabortion. The abortion issue has already returned to thestate legislatures following the Webster decision but, freshfrom his grudge match with Chuck Robb, Virginia Gov. DouglasWilder asked, &quot;How much allegiance does {Judge Thomas} haveto the pope?&quot; The John Kennedy precedent aside, theConstitution says &quot;no religious test shall ever be requiredas a qualification to any office.&quot; This non-issue may bemoot. Judge Thomas attends the Truro Episcopal Church inVirginia.                                                                                                          He's Not Black. Derrick Bell, a Harvard law professsor,declared that Judge Thomas &quot;doesn't think like a black.&quot;Columnist Carl Rowan said, &quot;If you gave Clarence Thomas alittle flour on his face, you'd think you had David Duketalking.&quot; Ugly, but nothing new. &quot;Here's a strange black,&quot;Judge Thomas says about how people see black conservatives.&quot;Let's go see if he has two heads and a tail.&quot;                                                                                                          He Is Black. When Sen. George Mitchell declared that JudgeThomas was nominated only because of his race, President Bushwondered if he &quot;accused Lyndon Johnson of a quota&quot; fornominating Thurgood Marshall. On what grounds is Judge Thomasunqualified? He's written more law review articles than DavidSouter, has more law-enforcement experience than JusticeMarshall and his years at Monsanto would make him the onlyjustice with experience working as a corporation lawyer.Admittedly, there is a single mostqualified nominee; maybePresident Bush should send up Robert Bork's name if JudgeThomas is defeated.                                                                                                          He's an Affirmative Action Ingrate. Judge Thomasrepresents a generation of minorities who have felt bothsides of the affirmative-action sword. At Yale Law School, hesat in the back of classrooms in the hope that professorswould not notice his race and assume he was less qualified.One of his happiest experiences at Yale was when he went topick up his blindly graded final exam in tax law. Thesecretary handed him a copy of the best exam while she lookedfor his. He was thrilled to see that the model exam was his.   He ran into a double standard when law firms recruitedhim. Instead of discussing his favorite legal subjects -- taxand corporate law -- lawyers would only tell him about theirminority hiring and public-interest work. This is why JudgeThomas instead became assistant attorney general in Missouriunder John Danforth, who agreed to treat him like anyoneelse.                                                                                                          Only Liberals Can Cite Natural Rights. The hypocrisy awardgoes to Harvard's Laurence Tribe. After a career of urgingliberal judges to look beyond the Constitution, he criticizedJudge Thomas for writing about natural rights, which hehasn't invoked as a judge. He had a narrow purpose forthinking about natural rights when he ran the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission. This is that he thoughtBrown v. Board of Education did not go far enough because itrelied on sociological evidence more than legal principle tooverrule the separate-but-equal doctrine.   Judge Thomas wrote that a more enduring opinion would havereflected the original intent of the post-Civil Waramendments, which fulfilled the promise of equal rights inthe Declaration of Independence. Brown, he said, was a&quot;missed opportunity . . . to turn policy toward reason ratherthan sentiment, toward justice rather than sensitivity,toward freedom rather than dependence -- in other words,toward the spirit of the Founding.&quot; A close understanding ofthe Founders' background in natural-rights theory isimportant in interpreting the original intent of the documentthey left behind.                                                                                                          He's an Anti-Semite. Critics dug out a 1983 speech wherehe praised Louis Farrahkan's message of self-help for blacks.Once Mr. Farrahkan's anti-semitism became widely known, JudgeThomas gave speeches criticizing him -- more than Rep. GusSavage and others in the Black Caucus can say. Mr. Thomasinternationalized the EEOC by demanding rights for SovietJews. He was also the 1986 winner of the Humanitarian Awardfrom the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America,recognized for his &quot;commitment to the right of all Americansto live free from discrimination based on race, religion ornational origin and your support for the rights of Sabbathobservers.&quot;                                                                                                          He Has a Weird Personal Life. There was a leak about JudgeThomas using marijuana in college, which he disclosed when hewas appointed to the appeals court. Then there were reportsthat Mr. Thomas and his first wife had a bitter divorce. Hisformer father-in-law said the two &quot;were congenial and haveremained so,&quot; telling the Boston Herald that &quot;I'm very proudof Clarence, my whole family is.&quot; It's been reported thatJudge Thomas hung a Confederate flag in his Missouri office,but the flag was the Georgia State flag, which Judge Thomasdisplayed in mischievous patriotism for his home state.Perhaps trying to repeat the infamous scoop of the videotapesMr. Bork had rented, reporters perused the books Judge Thomasstores in his garage. They found such lascivious material asbooks by Ayn Rand, Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Alexander Pope.   These mudballs have not stuck, but the interest groupsknow they have until the September hearings. Judge Thomas andthe country deserve a debate on the Constitution,original-intent jurisprudence and judicial restraint.Instead, we will get endless smears that liberals hope willpostpone their greatest fear -- a conservative black justicewho will help legitimize a competing social and legal view.</TEXT></DOC>
