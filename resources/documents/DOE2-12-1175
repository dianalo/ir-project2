Alternately,the salt cavern filled with rock salt solution is filled with pumpablewaste materials so that the displaced volume of salt solution is filledwith pumpable waste materials in such a way that the displaced volumeof salt solution is pumped out and, after filling the cavern to abouttwo thirds to three quarters of its volume, the water of the liquid phaseis bound in the form of water of crystallization or as hydroxide or physicallyby adsorption through addition of hydrophilic compounds or substancesas a means of solidifying it. The cavern is then sealed.</TEXT></DOC>
