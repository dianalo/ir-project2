 Itscurrent forecasts through the year 2000, however, may be based on wishfulthinking.andP;  If you don't agree with those assumptions, it may be wise toproduce your own forecast.andP;  You can easily produce a reasonable alternativeto the Census Bureau's forecast by using 1-2-3 Release 2/2.01, 2.2, or 3 orSymphony Release 1.2 or 2.0 with the statistical add-in attached.andM;The simplest forecasting model is a straight line that is fitted to andextends beyond existing data.andP;  You determine the origin and slope of thisline by using linear regression.andP;  In my March 1987 article, &quot;UsingExponential Smoothing,&quot; I argued that this type of model is rarely usefulbecause it is difficult to find real business data that grow according to astraight line.andP;  When forecasting the United States population growth,however, these straight-line forecasts look a lot more reasonable.andM;Figure 1 shows that actual year-to-year population values, represented by thesquares, have indeed fallen along a straight line since 1960.andP;  The linerunning through the boxes was produced by performing a linear regression onthe known data and using the results to compute a set of predictedpopulations through the year 2000.andP;  In 1987, the most recent year for whichCensus Bureau data is available, the population was 243,773,000.andP;  By the year2000, the regression line projects growth to 273,410,000.andM;In January the Census Bureau published its forecast of annual populationsthrough the year 2080, predicting growth to 268,266,000 by the year 2000.andO;Figure 1 shows how the Census Bureau's forecast falls behind the regressionforecast.andP;  A crucial assumption behind the bureau's forecast is that thelevel of immigration will gradually decline between now and the end of thecentury.andP;  I agree, however, with Time's assessment (February 27, 1989) that&quot;the immigration wave is not likely to stop or even slow.&quot;andP;  The Census Bureaualso assumes that the number of births will gradually decline through theyear 2000.andP;  In my opinion, this also is unlikely.andM;A straight-line forecast can be justified by opinions about immigration andbirth rates.andP;  The technique's reliability can be proved by using historicaldata to &quot;forecast&quot; known population figures.andP;  The table below shows theresults of a five-year forecasting test.andP;  The regression forecasts were basedon population data for 1960 to 1982.andP;  The Census Bureau forecasts were madein May 1984 and were based on population data up to 1982.andP;  They differ fromwhat actually came to pass by a much larger margin than the regressionforecasts.andM;I should emphasize that this forecasting test is based on only one five-yearsample.andP;  Performing the same test with different starting years may producelarger or smaller differences between regression forecasts and those of theCensus Bureau.andP;  However, the error margins shown in the table should beenough to convince you that the straight-line regression model is worthconsideration.andM;REGRESSION-BASED FORECASTSandM;To duplicate the population forecast I used to make the graph, enter a seriesof years in one column of your worksheet, starting with the earliest year forwhich you have data and ending with the year through which you areforecasting.andP;  In the next column enter consecutive numbers starting with 1,and in a third column enter the known population values.andM;Next, produce a regression table: For the X values, use as many of thenumbers in the second column as there are known population numbers.andP;  For theY values, use the known populations themselves.andM;Finally, compute the predicted population values: Multiply each X value bythe X coefficient from the regression data and add the constant from theregression data.andM;To do all this, create the worksheet shown in figure 2 by following theinstructions in the setup box on the opposite page.andP;  Note that the regressionoutput in range A3..D11, including the labels, is created automatically whenyou issue the regression commands.andP;  The next two paragraphs explain how toproduce the regression table.andM;If you use 1-2-3, skip to the next paragraph.andP;  In Symphony, you must firstattach the statistical application STAT.APP.andP;  If you run Symphony from a harddisk, STAT.APP should be in the directory that has the Symphony programfiles.andP;  If you run Symphony from a floppy disk, place the Help and TutorialDisk in drive A.andP;  Select SERVICES Application Attach, select STAT.APP fromthe menu, then select Quit.andM;Press slash and select Data Regression (in Symphony, MENU Range Regres),select X-Range and specify range B14..B41, select Y-Range and specify rangeC14..C41, select Output-Range and specify cell A3, then select Go.andP;  After amoment, range A3..D11 of your worksheet matches that range in figure 2, andthe formulas in range D14..D54 return the values shown in the figure.andM;RUNNING A FORECASTING TESTandM;To show how accurately this model predicts the populations for the years 1983to 1987, issue the regression commands again, but adjust the X and Y rangesto B14..B36 and C14..C36, respectively.andP;  This creates a new set of values inrange A3..D11.andP;  The predicted-population formulas in column D, which dependon two of the regression values, change accordingly.andP;  Enter the labels shownin range E33..G36 of figure 3, then right-align the labels in rows 35 and 36by selecting/Range Label Right (in Symphony, MENU Range Label-Right) andspecifying range E35..G36.andP;  Enter the formula + $C37 - D37 in cell E37 andcopy this cell to range E38..E41.andP;  Enter a space and eight hyphens in cellE42 and enter the formula @SUM (E37..E41) in cell E43.andP;  The resulting valuesshow that the forecast missed predicting the actual populations for 1983 to1987 by 176,000 to 300,000.andP;  The total error for the five years was about 1.2million.andM;To see how well the Census Bureau did for the same period with the same baseof historical data, enter the values shown in range F37..F41 of figure 3,then copy range E37..E43 to cell G37.andP;  You'll see that the bureau missed themark by 576,000 to 740,000, with a total error of about 3.2 million.andM;Remember that you've adjusted the worksheet so that the forecasts through theyear 2000 are based on actual populations from 1960 to 1982.andP;  To makeprojections based on all available data, be sure to rerun the regressionusing B14..B41 and C14..C41 as the X and Y ranges.andM;As more historical population figures become available, you can add them tothe worksheet in column C.andP;  If you wish, you can extend the linear regressionforecast, say, to the year 2010.andP;  Add the values 2001 to 2010 in rangeA55..A64, add the values 42 to 51 in range B55..B64, and assign the Generalformat to these new values.andP;  Finally, copy the formula in cell D54 to rangeD55..D64.andP;  Do this only if you feel that the population increase willcontinue along a straight line.andM;SOURCES OF FORECASTS AND DATAandM;The standard reference source for population forecasts is Projections of thePopulation of the United States, by Age, Sex, and Race: 1988 to 2080 (SeriesP-25, No.andP;  1018, January 1989, U.S.andP;  Government Printing Office, Washington,DC 20402).andP;  This report explains the Bureau's assumptions and forecastingmethodology and contains more than 100 pages of detailed tables.andP;  To obtainmore detailed data on hard copy or in machine-readable form, write to theData User Services Division, Customer Services, Bureau of the Census,Washington, DC 20233, or call 301-763-4100.andM;For each year in the analysis period, the bureau produces 30 forecasts withthree basic series: high, middle, and low.andP;  The high and low forecasts arenot the same things as confidence limits; they simply reflect reasonablevalues.andP;  The middle series of forecasts was used in all comparisons in thisarticle.andP;  The figures for past populations were taken from the StatisticalAbstract of the United States 1988.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
