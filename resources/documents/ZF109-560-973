 SAA-compliant integrated application software packages havebegun to hit the market.andM;But that does not mean that SAA now offers all the elements needed to fulfillits potentialities for cooperative processing.andP;  Nor does it mean that thenext few years will see fully integrated SAA-based application softwareproducts in widespread use.andP;  Current releases that are arguably SAA-compliantmay be designed for the IBM 370 and are not as yet adapted for cooperativeprocessing in AS/400 and PS/2 environments.andP;  Or the offering may be presentedas a usable but incomplete product.andM;Where SAA-based software has been adopted, the system typically is not yetfully operational.andP;  How effectively the initial run of products will meetuser requirements when deployed is still unclear.andM;What is clear is that SAA-conforming application technology is further alongthan most prospective users may recognize, and has begun to offer moretangible capability than corporate managers may be ready to cope with.andM;Counterbalancing the strategic appeal of cooperative processing are anxietiesover the corporate consequences of decentralized, realtime, informationmanagement and decision-support systems.andP;  Because cooperative processingaffects the organizational structure, asset management and conduct ofbusiness, many firms are ambivalent about the prospects of full-scale SAAimplementation.andM;Lowell Schmidt, IS vice president of Farmers Alliance Mutual Insurance Co.,andO;McPherson, Kans., said, &quot;We all want the benefits of SAA; it's the conversionprocess that haunts us.&quot;andM;The change to a workstation-based information management system, serving abattery of self-sufficient professional administrators, is disturbing,Schmidt said.andP;  Serious financial investments are required and strategiccommitments must be made along untried paths.andP;  In addition, workingrelationships must be redefined, systems have to be reconfigured and workersmust be retrained.andM;The problems will not just disappear, of course.andP;  So organizations do whatseems most reasonable; they delay confronting the problems.andP;  However, majorcomputer-dependent firms should begin planning how to move toward adistributed processing applications environment.andM;IBM-oriented organizations whose competitive position depends on keeping upwith computer applications technology cannot afford the assumption that SAAimplementation is too far off to warrant strategic attention.andP;  They canexpect to see within the next three years a burgeoning of integrated, highlyuser-friendly products flexibly designed for current and evolving cooperativeprocessing environments.andM;Leading-edge application software product lines illustrate both thesophistication and diversity of announced and, in the case of one vendor,partially available SAA-conforming application products designed forcooperative processing.andM;DOCTORS GET DECISION SUPPORTandM;Automated application products in the health care industry have mainly beenenterprise-oriented, designed for institutional use.andP;  Recently, Hauppauge,N.Y.-based Spectrum Healthcare Solutions, a partnership of IBM and Baxtersubsidiaries (formed January 1, 1990), announced an addition to its hospitalinformation management and practice management product lines.andP;  The product,Physician's Aide, addresses the physician's information requirements.andM;Physician's Aide is an integrated, workstation-based decision-support systemthat will give doctors access to patient information on a LAN-connected,realtime, interactive basis, 24 hours a day.andM;John Napoli, Spectrum's advanced technologies director, said the product mapsthe information requirements of the physician over a daily cycle and providesturnkey support without encroaching on the doctor's diagnostic ordecision-making functions.andM;Designed for use on a PS/2-OS/2 platform, Physician's Aide incorporates anopen architecture that will seamlessly connect to 370 mainframe and AS/400midrange systems; it can transparently interface the DOS environment as well.andO;Screen versatility is enhanced by Microsoft's Windows 3, supported by a laserdisk.andM;Within IBM and IBM-compatible environments, hardware poses no problems,Napoli said.andP;  The major design challenge was to achieve the functionality tomake the system consistent with the physician's professional needs, and tocreate a back end that would deliver the required communication power.andM;If Physician's Aide lives up to its design specifications, &quot;it can help tofill a vital need in current health care practice,&quot; said physician JeremyNobel, a practicing internist and specialist in patient-care research on thefaculty of Harvard School of Public Health, Cambridge, Mass.andM;Physicians need tools that will give them the productivity and connectivityto deliver health care with the speed, precision and efficiency that only canbe achieved by &quot;new paradigms of realtime automation,&quot; Nobel asserted.andM;Said Napoli, &quot;Meeting the design criteria required building into the systeman enormous amount of intelligence.&quot;andP;  Programming for Physician's Aidesequentially anticipates the thought process of the physician extended to itslogical implications.andP;  It then provides the information access, guidance anddelivery capabilities necessary to expedite appropriate action.andP;  Alsocritical is the application-building capability designed to keep the systemopen to advances in system technology and the special requirements ofindividual physicians.andM;&quot;Meeting SAA standards was the easier part,&quot; Napoli observed.andM;How compliant is the new product with SAA requirements?andP;  It is a logicalquestion, Napoli acknowledges, but not necessarily open to an objectivestandard of measurement.andP;  &quot;SAA is just a bill of materials with enablingsoftware,&quot; he said.andM;Beyond basic levels of compliance, SAA does not dictate application designstrategy, Napoli said.andP;  &quot;It [SAA] says 'Use C or Cobol,' for example; itdoesn't tell you which to use or how to code the application.andP;  That's thesoftware designer's job.&quot;andM;Once the decision is made, however, the design should be maintained as longas it remains profitable and strategically supportable.andP;  SAA rules andoptions are bound to change, Napoli said.andP;  &quot;We want to protect our investmentand that of our customers by adding functionality rather than changing designstrategy each time IBM delivers a new SAA release.&quot;andP;  Building in anadaptability to change enables the vendor to conserve costs and simplifymigration.andM;Physician's Aide incorporates the basic SAA components IBM has delivered,Napoli said, including common command procedures and screen standards,DB2-SQL, user programming tools and Systems Network Architecture (SNA)Logical Unit 6.2.andP;  He said more work needs to be done to distribute DB2 andget online with AD/Cycle repository architecture, so the software designercan get a better fix on strategic business definitions.andP;  This, according toNapoli, will strengthen the flexibility and productivity of the enterprisedatabase.andM;Spectrum is waiting for IBM to deliver better connectivity to the Unixenvironment and eventually to the Integrated SystemsandM;Digital Network (ISDN).andP;   ButandM;these gaps, which one day will be closed, do not prevent Physician's Aidefrom being a viable tool now, according to Napoli.andM;The first product shipments are scheduled for September 1991.andP;  Prices are asyet undetermined.andM;In addition to the health care industry, SAA-compliant products are targetingthe insurance industry.andP;  Policy Management Systems Corporation (PMSC),Columbia, S.C., specializes in application software development andinformation services for the insurance industry worldwide.andP;  Its Series IIproduct line comprises a family of functionally integrated applicationsoftware packages.andM;Since 1987, the firm has invested $100 million in Randamp;D toward development ofSeries III.andP;  The product line uses new functional models set in an SAA designframework.andM;Chairman and President G. Larry Wilson said the objective was to create anapplication environment that will replace paper-based systems and clericalsupport with knowledge workers backed by intelligent workstations.andP;  The newmanpower structure will exploit the efficiencies and cost savings ofcooperative processing, software system portability, work-in-process controland relational databases.andP;  Said Wilson, &quot;We set out to bring enterprise-widecomputing to the insurance industry.&quot;andM;In June, PMSC introduced the first eight products of Series III, designed forproperty and casualty applications with IBM 370-PS/2 connectivity.andP;  A totalof 39 products embracing the major lines of business will be released overthe next three years.andM;In the area of product support, PMSC has introduced what it labels InsuranceApplications Platform (IAP).andP;  IAP is a software framework and toolsetdesigned to assure that Series III software will comply with SAA rules.andP;  Itwill also enable the implementation of Series III functionality within theSAA framework, as well as provide insurance companies with the ability todevelop their own custom enhancements or new SAA-conforming applicationsystems architecture more easily and reliably.andM;IAP design comprises five components: Presentation Control Facility, AdvancedCommunications Program, Process Management, Data Model and Process Model.andO;The IAP framework:andM;* enables programmers to develop screen presentations with a consistent lookand feel across all applications under IBM's OS/2 Presentation Managersystem, based on the Common User Access (CUA) standard;andM;* ensures that data and process requests are delivered to the appropriateplatform quickly and efficiently via IBM's Advanced Program-to-ProgramCommunications (APPC) facility;andM;* provides the interface software for cooperative processing in varyinghardware and software system configurations, coordinating all process anddata requests at any location in the enterprise network; andandM;* establishes the enterprise database structure and elements, defines thetransaction processes for all applications and uses the models as blueprintsfor the design of advanced insurance applications.andM;Series III with IAP support benefits users in three ways: It simplifies theadministrative process, strengthens the productivity of strategicdecisionmakers and expedites communication.andM;One of the first benefits can be seen in the corporate budget.andP;  By reducingthe amount of manual tasks, IAP-based Series III acts to decrease clericalstaff, redundancy and internal operational costs.andM;Myra Miracle, VP for Series III development, noted that &quot;adoptions won'thappen en masse overnight.&quot;andP;  The state of technology, organizationalstructures and corporate readiness for change vary among customers.andP;  Whilemost are IBM-oriented, only a small segment seems prepared to initiate SAAconversion.andM;Wilson points out that Series III is built on a broad foundation ofapplication products.andP;  He adds that the line has been under development wellover three years, has 2,000 programmers working on the project and 2,000service people ready to help customers implement use.andP;  By the time the firstphase of product development is completed, the Randamp;D effort is expected to have$150 million behind it.andM;Wilson also points to the Randamp;D, product and marketing strength represented byits alliance with IBM.andP;  In August 1989, IBM purchased a 19.8% equity interestin PMSC, signed a joint development and marketing agreement, and establishedPMSC as an IBM Insurance Applications Affiliate.andP;  (PMSC is one of 13 U.S.andO;software companies in which IBM made equity investments in 1989.)andM;Another major boost in Randamp;D support has resulted from strategic clientrelationships formed last year with six--three domestic and threeforeign--property and casualty insurance companies, whose designerscollaborate with PMSC's Randamp;D team in Columbia.andM;Only a few of its Series III products are available, but PMSC expresses noreservation about its right to claim product-wide SAA compliance or sellSeries III on that basis now.andP;  CUA-conforming data acquisition and managementcontrols, DB2 with SQL, CPI-and CCS-compliant programming and communicationsystems are in place for cooperative processing between OS/2, OS/400, VM andMVS.andP;  What is needed are customer commitments.andM;Late in 1989, Farmer's Alliance Mutual Insurance Co. cut a deal with PMSCthat took effect January 1 of this year.andP;  It was one of the first of its kindin the insurance industry.andM;The company had been using 20-year-old information technology based on an IBM4341 mainframe and nonprogrammable satellite terminals, said the insurancecompany's Schmidt.andP;  &quot;We knew that in order to remain competitive, we wouldhave to adopt the techniques of current information technology.&quot;andM;On the recommendation of its strategic planning committee, Farmer's Allianceupgraded to an IBM 4381 with LAN connections to over 100 PCs and PS/2s.andP;  Thecommittee also recommended adoption of PMSC's Series III.andM;&quot;We found that PMSC was moving in the same direction as we were: PS/2, DB2,PC-mainframe communication, LANs, realtime distributed processing,&quot; Schmidtsaid.andP;  No one else seemed to be working on anything comparable, he said.andO;&quot;Other vendors offered to tweak what we had to keep our systems productive;PMSC was way ahead in Randamp;D.&quot;andM;Farmer's Alliance elected to take available pieces of Series III and set up adirect bill requirements study for Series III's Billing and CollectionManagement System release.andP;  The program was scheduled to run one year,starting April 1, 1990.andM;It is too early to appraise the productive impact of Series III, Schmidtsaid.andP;  Implementation of Series III will evolve over a five- to six-yearperiod.andP;  The company probably will not be able to report comprehensiveresults until 1995-96, and does not expect radical increases in revenuegrowth or market share.andM;Schmidt said it is also too soon to talk about the competitive advantages ofthe move.andM;The race for strategic advantage is further obscured because the carrierswill be forced to link their corporate objectives to the conversion plans oftheir agencies.andP;  Agency participation will be a vital element in the successof cooperative processing, Schmidt asserted.andP;  How long it will take until theagencies are online is another unknown.andM;Revolutionizing corporate systems may appeal to systems vendors; it can bedisastrous for customers.andP;  A more gradual, orderly process of assimilationmay ease the trauma of staff reductions and organizational restructuring.andO;Schmidt admitted, &quot;If we could, we would prefer to sweep the problem underthe rug.&quot;andM;JOHN HANCOCK: TIME WILL TELLandM;John Hancock Property andamp; Casualty, a Boston-based subsidiary of John HancockMutual Life, adopted Series II products in 1983.andP;  Ross Whittier, VP ofsystems and policy holder services, said PMSC &quot;is going in the rightdirection with Series III.&quot;andM;John Hancock has used PMSC as a service agency for Series II processing,administration and development support.andP;  In 1989, Hancock became a strategicpartner in Series III with licensing rights to the full product line.andP;  Notingthat his company upgraded its Series II systems last year, Whittier stated,&quot;Before we'll be able to evaluate our commitment to Series III, we'll need toknow more about [its] capabilities and limitations.&quot;andM;Replacement of Series II with Series III will be no small project.andP;  Thecompany is highly departmentalized and thoroughly oriented to Series II.andO;Assimilation of the new systems predictably will demand constrainingtechnical adjustments.andM;But the major disruptions will doubtless be cultural, Whittier said.andP;  Systemsreplacement generates a fear of people replacement and job restructuring.andO;&quot;We'll want automation to strengthen our human resources, not replace orintimidate them,&quot; he said.andM;Another vendor developing under SAA is American Software, Inc., Atlanta.andP;  Thefirm develops application products mainly for realtime integrated materialsmanagement and financial control systems.andM;Tom McLinden, divisional vice president for purchasing and materialsmanagement systems, points out that the company &quot;independently anticipatedmuch of the direction of IBM's software strategy for the SAA environment.&quot;andO;For example, source code for all applications is written in Cobol, one of thetwo languages specified for SAA conformity.andP;  Cobol was even used for theSystem/38 midrange computer, &quot;when everyone else was using RPG,&quot; he said.andM;In addition, American Software took an open-architecture approach before itwas fashionable among most application software vendors.andM;All of the company's SAA application products now or will supportSAA-compliant cooperative processing within the IBM/370 environment.andO;Programmable workstations (PWSs) and host-attached non-programmable terminals(NPTs) are both included in American's SAA design umbrella, where each islinked to a 370 host-based transaction processing facility.andP;  Thegraphic-oriented advanced-level CUA specification will be used for PWSs.andP;  Thetext-oriented entry-level CUA specification will be used for host-attachedNPTs.andM;The PWS portion is designed for the PS/2 using OS/2EE.andP;  Cobol governsapplication programming; SQL controls data manipulation with OS/2 DataManager.andP;  OS/2 Dialog Manager, OS/2 Presentation Manager and Easel for OS/2are used to provide user presentation services.andP;  OS/2 Communications Manageris used for the APPC host communication services, and workstation-hostconnectivity will be supplied by LU6.2.andM;System/370-based applications will operate on the entire line of System/370processors, requiring either the IBM MVS/SP or VSE/SP operating system.andP;  TheSystem/370 host portion of the application employs the CICS/VS transactionprocessing facility running on DB2.andP;  Application programming is supported byVS Cobol II, DB2 manipulation by SQL/DS and PWS communication by the LU6.2APPC capabilities of CICS.andP;  IMS-DC transaction processing facility isoptionally available.andM;The AmSoft Solution Builder is an application software development tooldesigned to facilitate the creation of SAA-conforming application products.andM;At the August IBM-sponsored SAA conference held in New York, AmericanSoftware announced development of product-wide SAA-compliance for the AS/400.andO;The company further disclosed that SAA-based PC applications are underdevelopment.andM;Galileo's monumental calculations on the acceleration of a falling objectunfortunately give no clue to the acceleration of developments in softwaretechnology.andP;  All that can be agreed on is that it is fast.andP;  And once a systemtakes hold, development is even faster.andM;So it would seem with the evolution of cooperative processing in the SAAenvironment.andP;  Whether fully connected SAA-based cooperative processing in370, AS/400 and PS/2 environments will be a practical reality soon isconjectural.andP;  What is certain is that leading vendors of integratedapplication software are committed to the task and that the race is on.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
