Troops shot and killed a Palestinian in the West Bank town ofNablus during a stone-throwing confrontation and wounded 17 othersin clashes in the Gaza Strip, Arab reports said.   The army said it was checking the reports.   The death of Bilal Einab, 20, brought to 575 the number of Arabskilled by Israeli troops or civilians since the start of thePalestinian uprising in December 1987. An additional 121Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion ofcollaborating with Israel. Forty Israelis have died.   Also Thursday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin picked up a keyendorsement amid growing signs he may be able to unseat FinanceMinister Shimon Peres as leader of the left-leaning Labor Party.   Rabin, 67, who was prime minister from 1974-77, won backing fromLabor Party doves Ely Ben-Menachem and Ezer Weizman, the scienceminister.   The leadership issue is unlikely to come to a head unlessLabor's coalition with the right-wing Likud bloc breaks apart _likely only with serious movement toward Israeli-Palestiniannegotiations.   Hamas emerged soon after the start of the revolt, spreading itsinfluence from Gaza to parts of the West Bank. The movementadvocates an Islamic state including the occupied lands and Israel.   ``This movement has a religious character, is very radical andis using very cruel means. It pledged violent struggle not onlyagainst Israel but also against Judaism and Zionism,'' said ShmuelGoren, Israel's coordinator for the occupied territories.   The army announced a three-day closure of the Gaza Strip fromFriday through Monday during Rosh Hashana, the New Year holiday.Security throughout the country will be reinforced over the weekend.   Also Thursday, Palestinian activist Faisal Husseini warned theuprising will intensify if peace efforts fail, but he rejected theidea of armed struggle.   Husseini and three other prominent Palestinians, speaking on apanel, also said the 10-point Egyptian peace plan, aimed at endingthe impasse over Israel's peace initiative, does not go far enoughin pressing for Palestinian independence.   ``We are ready to deal with any proposal, we are ready to startany negotiations if we will be addressed as a people, not as aminority or as refugees or as inhabitants of a certain place,'' hesaid.   Husseini, a pro-PLO activist, told the forum sponsored by theForeign Press Association that if peace efforts fail, ``We willescalate our struggle. We will cover more areas, cover morepeople.''   But ``we will not be provoked. The Israelis will not push us touse weapons,'' Husseini said.   He and the other activists said the Palestinians were ready toopen peace talks with Israel but criticized the Israeligovernment's peace initiative and the plan put forward by EgyptianPresident Hosni Mubarak.   The Israeli government has called for elections in the occupiedterritories to select Palestinians to open talks with Israel on aninterim period of self-rule.   Mubarak, in an effort to overcome Palestine LiberationOrganization objections to the Israeli plan, has urged Israel tohold preliminary talks with a delegation including Palestiniansfrom outside the territories, and to consider accepting theU.S.-backed formula of trading land for peace. There is oppositionin Israel to both moves.   The Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq, meanwhile, charged ina statement that tax raids in the Wst Bank town of Beit Sahour byarmy troops were ``blatantly illegal'' and conducted with``extraordinary ... savagery and violence.''   Troops have been entering homes in Beit Sahour, a town of about5,000 people near Bethlehem, and confiscating goods since Sept. 20in lieu of unpaid taxes.   A PLO-ordered tax boycott has been widely observed in BeitSahour, a hotbed of activism against Israeli occupation. Residentsclosed shops and offices Thursday at the start of a three-daystrike to protest the raids.</TEXT></DOC>
