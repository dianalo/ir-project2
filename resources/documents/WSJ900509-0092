In federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., William Capaldoadmitted that the scheme involved passing on to the federalgovernment sham bills for $300,000 of packaging materials.The government ultimately covered the amounts in the phonybills, which were submitted to Grumman by a Long Island,N.Y., paper company between 1982 and 1987, according to thegovernment.</LP><TEXT>   Court documents indicate that the Grumman supplier, headedby James Kane, who has since died, paid Mr. Capaldo $75,000for certifying that the bills were legitimate. Mr. Capaldoalso admitted that he failed to report the money in hisfederal income tax returns. Grumman has said it isn't atarget of a continuing grand jury investigation in Brooklyn.   The guilty plea is an offshoot of earlier grand juryinvestigations of Grumman's business dealings with Mr. Kaneand a Long Island-based political action committee he headed.   A 1988 search warrant for another of Mr. Kane's companiesindicated that prosecutors were investigating whether he gavestock or other &quot;things of value&quot; to public officials. Inaddition, prosecutors have delved into Mr. Kane's contactswith former consultants and officials of Unisys Corp. andother defense contractors implicated in the procurementscandal.   Andrew Maloney, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, said therewould be &quot;some future activity coming out of this office&quot;following yesterday's guilty plea.
