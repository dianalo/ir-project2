Dukakis insisted there was no deal, no fine print worked out inthe nearly three-hour meeting at his hotel, only a betterrelationship with the man who fought for the presidentialnomination until the end.   ``I want Jesse Jackson to play a major role in this campaign. Iwant his supporters, who are out there by the millions, to bedeeply involved in this campaign,'' Dukakis told a packed newsconference after the meeting. ``And he is going to be involvedactively and fully.''   ``Obviously, I want to play a supportive role, a complementaryrole,'' Jackson said Monday night.   The agreement between the candidates includes financial backingfrom party funds to pay for Jackson's campaigning on behalf of theticket and needed personal staff, said Ron Brown, Jackson'sconvention manager.   ``Of course funding will be made available for the travel plansfor Rev. Jackson,'' said Dukakis campaign chairman Paul Brountas.   ``If the man's got to travel, we're not going to let him flycommercial,'' said Joseph Warren, a longtime Dukakis supporter whohas been involved in the negotiations. ``Make no mistake about it.What Jesse needs, Jesse will get.''   In addition, Jackson supporters will get close to half the new25 at-large slots on the Democratic National Committee and a newvice DNC chairman.   ``When the Democratic National Committee meets on Friday, itwill be more reflective of the new Democratic Party,'' Jackson said.   California Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, an outspoken Jacksonbacker, revealed the vice chairman slot as part of the deal andpronounced herself satisfied.   ``Dukakis announced it to the world: He needs Jesse Jackson,''she said.   And Jackson made it clear that he was sending the signal to hissupporters that Dukakis had looked for since the primaries ended.   ``I've sent a signal that we are involved,'' Jackson said,adding that Dukakis now must send a signal to Jackson backers. ``Insome sense, Gov. Dukakis must convey to those persons that he isreaching out ot them, that he cares for them, that they are on hisagenda. When it is all said and done, the nominee must convincepeople.''   And there was a wave of speculation about Jackson's impact on aDukakis administration, even though Jackson says he wants no job.   ``There are many things one could think of. He could be anoutstanding drug czar,'' said House Speaker Jim Wright. ``He hasthe passion, the belief, the dedication.''   DNC Treasurer Sharon Pratt Dixon said that there was ``clearlygoing to be a reflection of Jesse Jackson in a Dukakisadministration.''   Speaking with reporters after the Jackson supporter addressedthe convention, Dixon said he might be used as ``sort of a rovingambassador. Jesse Jackson sees himself in a more globalperspective. That's his scene, that's his stage.''   For his part, Jackson was upbeat about the meeting with Dukakisand his running mate _ in part because there were no roadblocks tohis pushing platform ideas in Tuesday night's convention session.   ``We did not come here for fireworks. We came here for nobleworks,'' Jackson told more than 2,000 of his delegates andsupporters.   ``Today we had a great meeting with Governor Dukakis and Sen.Lloyd Bentsen, a serious meeting,'' he added. ``In that meeting,there was the good judgment that debate is healthy for democracy.''   ``I think there was a real meeting of the minds,'' said Brown,who sat in on the meeting.   The summit meeting was held in Dukakis's hotel suite, justacross Peachtree Street from the hotel where Jackson is staying.   Jackson has bedeviled Dukakis for weeks by pushing hispresidential hopes and then his hopes for the vice presidency,saying he and his constituency had earned consideration. AfterDukakis picked Bentsen for the No. 2 spot, the tensions between thecampaigns increased.   At last, at the news conference, Jackson admitted his campaignwould officially end Wednesday night.   ``I'm still looking for a Chicago miracle,'' Jackson said, anear impossibility considering Dukakis' lock on far more than amajority of the delegates. ``If the miracle does not come to pass,then we'll have passed over to the next phase of our campaign.''   A bit later, the Greek-American governor of Massachusettsreplied: ``I don't think we're going to have a Chicago miracle ...we're going to have an Athenian miracle.''   Jackson said he wouldn't encourage anyone to put his name on theroll call on Thursday night when Bentsen is scheduled to beconfirmed as the vice presidential nominee.   And Jackson promised to work for the ticket against George Bushand the Republicans in the fall.   ``We met and discussed matters of serious and significantconcern, a relationship of substance, support and candor, thecommitment to help build a team that will expand our party andcarry us to victory in November,'' he told the news conference.   At a later stop, Jackson added, ``There was no discussion todayon the planks for the platform.''   Asked if he was depressed by the end of his campaign, Jacksonsaid it was the opposite: ``There's a sense of relief.''   Brountas denied that any agreement was reached that wouldguarantee Jackson supporters a role in a transition to a Dukakisadministration, should the Democrats win in the fall.   ``We decided not to go beyond the campaign,'' Brountas said.   Jackson agreed, adding that a future role will follow naturally:``That's a bit far off, but it stands to reason if you're part ofthe campaign. ... If you win, you are part of the transition andyou're part of the government. Let's take it one step at atime....''</TEXT></DOC>
