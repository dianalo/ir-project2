Developer Minoru Isutani, the new owner of Pebble BeachCo. and its famed Monterey Peninsula courses, is believed tobe considering selling more than 700 memberships for $740,000each, or about $560 million. Only other Japanese tycoons arelikely to be interested in paying such huge sums to belong toa golf club. Although the public would still be able to playthe courses, the members would get preference, theoreticallylimiting the access of Americans.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Isutani's company, Cosmo World Co., is denying thereports, carried in the Japanese press, but U.S. golfexecutives assert that such a plan is in the works and thatit reflects the financial difficulties of one of Mr.Isutani's key backers.   &quot;It is a golfing shrine and therefore, in my opinion, itshould be made available to the public,&quot; says Robert TrentJones Jr., the renowned golf course architect who helpeddesign Pebble Beach's Spanish Bay course.   People experienced with the way the Japanese run golfcourses they acquired in Hawaii, and with the way theJapanese buy and sell golf memberships, say not to worry. JoeBeditz, president and chief executive officer of the NationalGolf Foundation, Jupiter, Fla., said they maintain publicaccess to the Hawaiian courses. Moreover, in Japan, thewealthy pay up to $2 million to join private clubs, but oftennever set foot on a course. Rather, they regard membershipsas investments, trading in them as if they were commodityoptions. The practice indicates that Japanese members of aPebble Beach club wouldn't inundate the links.   David B. Hueber, president of Ben Hogan Property Cos., aFort Worth, Texas, subsidiary of Cosmo that owns the5,300-acre Pebble Beach property, insists the courses wouldremain accessible to the public and flatly denied reports ofmemberships being sold for $740,000 -- which would makePebble Beach the most expensive golf course in the U.S. Thecurrent highest U.S. golf memberships are about $200,000. ButMr. Hueber declined comment on whether there were plans forprivate memberships at all, and he added that &quot;we continue todevelop plans to insure the maintenance and enhancement ofPebble Beach&quot; and that an announcement should be forthcomingsoon.   Mr. Isutani bought Pebble Beach last year from oil manMarvin Davis and several other U.S. investors for anestimated $800 million to $1 billion. The purchase was partlyfinanced by a $574 million loan from Mitsubishi Trust andamp;Banking Corp., obtained by Mr. Isutani with the help ofOsaka-based Itoman andamp; Co. Itoman, a real estate conglomerate,issued a promissory note as collateral for Mr. Isutani'sCosmo World Corp., but is now believed to be struggling with$10 billion of debt.   Two executives close to the Pebble Beach deal said CosmoWorld would in fact begin selling the memberships for around$700,000 to help shore up the loan for the property andreplace the shaky Itoman collateral. They said MitsubishiTrust is in effect requiring additional equity from CosmoWorld.   According to John A. Lisanti, chairman and chief executiveofficer of American International Golf Resorts, a MarinCounty, Calif., developer and broker of golf coursetransactions, Cosmo has to sell the private memberships toraise badly needed cash.   &quot;I believe $700,000-plus for one of the best resorts inthe world will sell in Japan,&quot; Mr. Lisanti said.   If the arrangement follows the pattern of otherJapanese-owned golf resorts in the U.S., Mr. Lisanti said thecourses would remain open to some public play -- but for ahigher price. The green fee for the Pebble Beach courses,which include the Pebble Beach Golf Links, Spanish Bay,Spyglass Hill and Del Monte, is already about $200.   Mr. Isutani might face some formidable local obstacles,however. Both the Monterey County Board of Supervisors andthe state Coastal Commission would scrutinize the deal tomake sure it doesn't constitute the illegal sale oftime-sharing investments or unduly limit public access.</TEXT></DOC>
