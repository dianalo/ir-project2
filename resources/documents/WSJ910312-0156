U.S. District Court Judge Charles Haight Jr. in New Yorkruled that the group must disgorge $676,730 of illegal profitgained from trading stock and options before the deal wasannounced in July. He added a $2 million insider-tradingpenalty that members of the group would have to pay.</LP><TEXT>   The SEC hasn't identified the investors, but an SECattorney said between 20 and 30 people have been targeted bythe agency's investigation. Yesterday, just days after thejudge signed the judgment, one of the defendants cameforward, according to SEC trial attorney Richard Simpson.That defendant, who Mr. Simpson wouldn't name, bought 50Contel call option contracts -- a bet that the stock wouldrise -- on July 11, the day before the deal was announced. Hehad a profit of $27,650, which he would have to return, andcould be liable for a penalty of $110,600.   In addition, two others are prepared to come forward, Mr.Simpson said. While they technically could be subject toJudge Haight's ruling, the agency hasn't determined how totreat those defendants, Rudolph Gerlich Jr., an assistantenforcement director, said. &quot;We'll have to see what kind ofcooperation we get from those parties,&quot; he said. &quot;We'retrying to be fair, and we try to encourage people to comeforward.&quot;   The SEC also has charged a group of German investors inthe case, and those charges are pending. But the agencyhasn't definitively identified who tipped the alleged insidertraders. &quot;We do not have conclusive evidence at this pointwho the tipper is,&quot; Mr. Simpson said. But he added that &quot;wedo have some leads we're following up on and ourinvestigation is continuing.&quot; The judge has ruled that thecase can go forward even without such a person beingidentified.   Mr. Simpson said the agency plans to file more charges inthe case, amounting to several hundred thousand dollars ofallegedly ill-gotten gains.   In the wake of Judge Haight's ruling, the SEC can beginliquidating frozen accounts at a number of brokerage firmsand place that money in the hands of the court. It would thenbe disbursed to investors who can prove they were on theopposite side of the illegal trades.</TEXT></DOC>
