The MAP is a self-pressurized, indirect-cyclelight water reactor with full natural circulation primary coolant flowand multiple once-through steam generators located within the reactorvessel. A fundamental tenent of the MAP design is its complete relianceon existing LWR technology. This reliance on conventional technologyprovides an extensive experience base which gives confidence in judgingthe safety and performance aspects of the design.</TEXT></DOC>
