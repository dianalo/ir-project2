(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A communications satellite launched for anAmerican company aboard the European Ariane rocket has failed toachieve a usable orbit and efforts will be made to nudge it intoits proper place.   ``We are trying to move the satellite into its orbitallocation,'' said Barbara Foelber, spokeswoman for GTE SpacenetCorp., which owns the GSTAR 3 satellite. The spacecraft, launchedSept. 8, was to have been used for private business communications.   She said engineers don't know the cause of the problem. Thesatellite reached the 22,300-mile altitude required and the rocketmotor fired to put it into a circular orbit. The firing apparentlywas not long enough and the satellite was put into an egg-shapedcourse around the Earth.   The spokeswoman said engineers will attempt to fire smallthrusters, normally used to keep the satellite from drifting out ofposition, to gently push the satellite into a path where its speedmatches the rotation of Earth. That maneuver has been performedsuccessfully before, notably with the Tracking and Data RelaySatellite launched by NASA in 1983.   The satellite, which cost $85 million to $100 million to buildand launch, was insured for $60 million, Ms. Foelber said.   ``We currently have five satellites in orbit,'' she said. ``Wewill be able to provide ... services needed'' by the company'scustomers, she added.   GTE has another in the series of GE Astro satellites scheduledfor launching in April 1991 and Ms. Foelber said the company willtry to move its launch date ahead.</TEXT></DOC>
