Box 400, Princeton, NJ 08540, hassubmitted pesticide petition (PP) 8F3589 to EPA proposing to amend 40 CFRPart 180 by establishing a tolerance for residues of the herbicide imazethapyr(2-[4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)-5-oxo-I<T3>H</T3>-imidazol-2-y1]-5-ethyl-3-pyridine-carboxylic acid, as its ammoniumsalt) in or on the raw agricultural commodity soybeans at 0.1 ppm. There were no comments received in response to the notice of filing. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have beenevaluated. The data considered in the petition include: an 18-month feeding/oncogenicstudy with mice fed dosages of 0, 150, 750, and 1,500 milligrams/kilogram/day(mg/kg/day) with no oncogenic effects observed under the conditions ofthe study at dose levels up to and including 1,500 mg/kg/day (highest dosetested [HDT]) and a systemic no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 750 mg/kg/day;a 2-year feeding/oncogenic study in rats fed dosages of 0, 50, 250, and500 mg/kg/day with no oncogenic effects observed under the conditions ofthe study at dose levels up to and including 500 mg/kg/day (HDT) and asystemic NOEL of 500 mg/kg/day (HDT); a 1-year feeding study in dogs feddosage levels of 0, 25, 125, and 250 mg/kg/day with a NOEL of 25 mg/kg/day;a teratology study in rats fed dosage levels of 0, 125, 375, and 1,125mg/kg/day, with a maternal toxicity NOEL of 375 mg/kg/day and a developmentaltoxicity NOEL of 1125 mg/kg/day; a teratology study in rabbits fed dosagelevels of 0, 100, 300 and 1,000 mg/kg/day with a maternal toxicity. NOELof 300 mg/kg/day and a developmental toxicity NOEL of 1,000 mg/kg/day;a two-generation reproduction study in rats fed dosage levels of 0, 50,250, and 500 mg/kg/day with a NOEL for systemic and reproductive effectsof 500 mg/kg/day; a mutagenic test with <T3>Salmonella typhimurium</T3> (negative); an <T3>in vitro</T3> chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster ovarycells (positive without metabolic activation but at dose levels that weretoxic to the cells and negative with metabolic activation); an <T3>in vivo</T3> chromosomal aberration test in rat bone marrow cells (negative);an unscheduled DNA synthesis study in rat hepatocytes (negative); and adominanat-lethal study in rats (negative at doses up to and including 2,000mg/kg). The provisional acceptable daily intake (PADI) based on the 90-day dogfeeding study (NOEL of 250 mg/kg/day) and an uncertainty factor of 1,000is calculated to be 0.25 mg/kg/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution(TMRC) for this tolerance is calculated to be 0.000034 mg/kg/day. The currentaction will occupy 0.014 percent of the ADI. There are no published tolerancesfor this chemical. The pesticide is useful for the purposes of this tolerancerule. The rat chronic feeding/oncogenicity study is acceptable as a chronic studybut is supplemental as an oncogenicity study. There were no toxic effectsobserved at the top dose level (500 mg/kg/day), an indication that themaximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. A repeat of this study willnot be required for the use of soybeans, however, because (1) 500 mg/kg/dayis within 50 percent of the upper limit dose necessary for an adequatelyconducted oncogenicity study on a chemical of low toxicity; (2) imazethapyris structurally related to two other pesticides which tested negativelyin oncogenicity studies in rats and mice; and (3) there were no positivemutagenicity studies for any of the three herbicides except for imazethapyrwhich had a positive result in the <T3>in vitro</T3> chromosomal aberration test, but only at dose levelsthat were toxic to the cells. The nature of the residue is adequately understood, and adequate analyticalmethods (gas chromatography with a thermionic nitrogen-phosphorus detector)are available for enforcement purposes. There are currently no actions pending against the registration of thischemical. No secondary residues are expected to occur in meat, milk, poultry,or eggs from this use. Based on the above information considered by the Agency, it is concludedthat the tolerance established by amending 40 CFR Part 180 will protectthe public health, and the tolerance is therefore established as set forthbelow. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days afterthe date of publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk,Environmental Protection Agency, at the address given above. Such objectionsshould be submitted in quintuplicate and specify the provisions of theregulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections. Ifa hearing is requested, the objections must state the issues for the hearing.A hearing will be granted if the objections are legally sufficient to justifythe relief sought. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulation from section3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certificationstatement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="21">(<T4>Authority:</T4> Sec. 408(d)(2), 68 Stat. 512 (21 U.S.C. 346a(d)(2)).)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 7, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
