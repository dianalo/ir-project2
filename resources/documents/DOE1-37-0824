Thiselevation in the urine formate concentration presents the possibilityof using this as a tool for monitoring exposure to chemicals. Unfortunately,the use of urine formate as a technique for monitoring personal chemicalexposure has yet to be evaluated. This review identifies several potentiallyimportant variables that could alter the extent to which formate is eliminatedthrough the urine and that could affect the accuracy of using urine formateconcentration as an indicator of chemical exposure. Some potentiallyimportant confounders that have been identified, but not evaluated adequately,include dietary intake, nutritional status and exposure to cigarettesmoke. Furthermore, the metabolism and elimination kinetics have yetto be adequately demonstrated in humans. Without having controlled forpotential confounders in previous pharmacokinetic studies, it is unknownwhether or not the large range and variation observed in human studiesis due to the confounders or to innate individual variability. Giventhe poor understanding of the normal variation of formate concentrationin the urine, the use of it as a biological indicator of chemical exposurebecomes questionable. Without appreciable skin penetration, as in thiscase, the reliance upon air monitoring alone may be more practical. Theevidence at this time suggests that the use of urine formate to monitorchemical exposure offers a broad opportunity for investigative research.82 references.</TEXT></DOC>
