(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Television evangelist Jim Bakker appealedfor money Tuesday, the second day of his new show being broadcast toa half-dozen stations.   But the retired judge who ruled over the PTL bankruptcy case saidBakker could not handle the millions of dollars raised in his firstshow.   In his second broadcast since he was forced off the air two yearsago in a sex-and-money scandal, Bakker asked listeners to send in``$100, or $25 or more'' in return for a ``Crisis Book ofScripture.''   Bakker told viewers he did not want to raise funds every day, butexpressed the belief the Heritage USA complex that was recently soldto a Canadian businessman would be restored to the PTL members whopaid for it.   Meanwhile, on ``CBS This Morning,'' Rufus Reynolds, the judge whosupervised the $65 million sale of PTL's assets, said his ``stomachcringed'' at the way Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, handled themoney he raised in the name of religion.   ``They just wasted a lot of it,'' he said. ``Why take religiousmoney collected for one purpose and throw it away for another?That's the whole picture.''   The broadcasts of the new ``Jim and Tammy'' show originated inthe living room of the Bakkers' borrowed home and were sent bysatellite to a six stations, mostly cable, in California, Ohio, NewYork, Pennsylvania and Louisiana, Bakker said.   Bakker, 49, and a former top associate were indicted last monthon charges of diverting $4 million in PTL money for their benefit. Atrial date is expected to be set Jan. 17.   The Bakkers had not preached together on television since January1987. Two months later, allegations surfaced of his 1980 sexualencounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn, forcing Bakker toleave the PTL ministry.   Bakker said one of his supporters donated money to put him backon the air for the first month.   Mrs. Bakker said Tuesday she did not think daily fund-raisingwould be necessary.   ``I believe God is going to start touching people's hearts,'' shesaid. ``I believe that we're not going to have to tell the people,that God will tell the people.''   But in the interview, the judge who ordered the Bakkers in acivil suit to repay the ministry $7.7 million in excessive benefitssaid Jim Bakker was ``not a very good businessman.''   Reynolds, who retired as a bankruptcy judge Saturday, said Bakkeronce chartered a plane for $130,000 ``just to take him out toCalifornia _ kept it out there two weeks. Things like that. Justmoney that you wouldn't think about spending, he did.''</TEXT></DOC>
