<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-46-0272 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Schroedinger equation is solved directly for the ground state andexcited 2 {sup 1}S state of the helium atom by using a rapidly convergenthyperspherical method which involves no adjustable parameters. The doubleand triple coalescence points are taken into account analytically. Thecenter-of-mass motion is treated nonperturbatively, and the cases ofinfinite and finite nuclear masses are considered. The inclusion of 169hyperspherical functions yields the precision of a few parts in 10{sup9} and 10{sup 8} for the expectation value of the Hamiltonian operatorand for all other expectation values, respectively, for the ground state,with only slightly less accuracy for the excited state.</TEXT></DOC>
