A man writes that his wife got mad at him for eyeing pretty women at the beach. The next day, she hid his contact lenses, forcing him to squint to make out shapes. He asks: &quot;Can't a guy even look?&quot;    A distraught woman writes to tell me that her lover's condom broke and she got pregnant. She complained to the maker of the condoms and received an apology for &quot;the inconvenience.&quot; Her question: How can she raise a child on a $1.75 refund check?    Then there is the girl who ran up a $600 telephone bill dialing toll-call party lines. &quot;I take the phone to work so my daughter can't use it,&quot; her mother writes. &quot;But she borrows phones from friends, plugs them in at our house and calls the party line. I'd like to cut off her dialing finger.&quot;    Such dilemmas are my business.    I'm the former Wall Street Journal reporter who became one of two replacements for Ann Landers. And in my first year on the job, I've found that the heartaches and revelations that cross my desk allow me unusual access to real life in America. I have a window into people's innermost feelings -- and the secret absurdities that rule their lives.    I got this job in a crazy way. Ann Landers left the Chicago Sun-Times, her home for 31 years, to join the rival Chicago Tribune. The Sun-Times held a highly publicized search to replace her, and 12,000 people applied. I decided to write about the competition for the Journal and entered it to get a fresh angle. I didn't expect to win: I assumed I was too irreverent, too young (28) and too male.    For these very reasons, perhaps, the Sun-Times selected me, along with lawyer Diane Crowley. She and I now write separate columns, &quot;Dear Diane&quot; and &quot;All That Zazz,&quot; syndicated in 45 newspapers.    I took the job promising to be innovative -- &quot;off the wall and on the mark.&quot; Most advice columnists lean on experts. So do I. But for common-sense advice, I've established a Regular Joes Advisory Board. Members -- including a cabdriver, hairdresser, mail carrier and nurse -- are all named Joe, Joanne or Josephine.    I also make house calls. When readers invite me to dinner, I must be prepared for any kind of family strife, any problem, any meal. I visited one home where I learned during dinner that the father had recently attempted suicide, and his 11-year-old daughter saved him.    Another visit was to a family of seven, all deaf. As they conversed effortlessly with their hands, my ears were useless; I was the handicapped one in their home. Their dog, responding to sign-language commands, did tricks for me.    Though I give serious advice for serious problems, I try to keep the column light whenever possible. &quot;My girlfriend's table manners are horrible,&quot; a man writes. &quot;How do I tell her?&quot; My answer: &quot;Tell her gently, using words like 'honey' or 'darling' while limiting use of the words 'gross,' 'disgusting' and 'animal-like.'&quot;    Some readers, accustomed to the predictability of Ann Landers, don't know what to make of the column. One day I'll give unsolicited advice to Elvis in heaven; the next I'll play Jeopardy with readers. (I give an answer; they write in with matching questions.)    Also, the advice business has been a sorority for so long that some readers aren't used to a male viewpoint. When men write me about marital spats or mothers-in-law, they often expect me to side with them unequivocally. If I don't, I get called &quot;a female advice columnist with male hormones&quot; -- and worse.    Women are even more easily offended. I got a letter from a man whose wife won't make love to him unless he shaves daily. I suggested that he compromise by shaving five days a week. Well, my answer rubbed scores of women the wrong way. Several suggested I rub sandpaper on my face to experience the sensations of stubble.    Adjusting to the high-profile aspects of this job wasn't easy. After a mostly anonymous career as a rumpled reporter, I found myself in the media spotlight, and feeling awkward about it. (I've learned, however, that big-time television isn't all glamour. On Oprah Winfrey's show, I had to share a glass of water with three other guests.)    As a reporter, my wardrobe was never my strong suit. So I've since bought two telegenic suits, both blue.    Strangers recognize me, especially when I wear one of my new suits. At restaurants, they send over questions written on napkins. They corner me on the subway. They call me at home.    In one way, at least, little has changed since I left the Journal. I still cover the business world. Except these days I usually don't get asked about futures straddle strategies.    Instead, a factory worker asks me if he should report drunk co-workers. A woman wonders if a sequined dress is appropriate for the Christmas party in her plant's lunchroom. A clerk happens upon her boss's pay stub and regrets spreading his salary around the office. A man asks if it's gauche to request a doggie bag at an important business lunch -- especially if he isn't paying.    I also hear from a woman whose husband's company bars spouses from its &quot;working weekends&quot; in Florida, yet always sponsors an employee dance contest on the beach.    For a &quot;fact-finding&quot; column, I asked readers about &quot;quitting with style.&quot; Had they ever gotten so fed up with a rotten job that they quit on the spot and waltzed out, never to return? More than 60,000 Americans quit their jobs every day, and I heard from or about scores of them: The auto upholsterer who won $1.9 million in the lottery and hired a band to play &quot;Take This Job and Shove It&quot; for his boss; the receptionist who deserted a wildly blinking phone board; the waitress who skipped out of town between courses.    For Secretaries Week, I asked secretaries to give advice to their bosses. Many advised: &quot;Quit being a slave driver.&quot; One secretary wrote: &quot;Any time my typewriter was off for a minute, my boss shouted, 'Whatcha doin', Edythe?' So one day I responded: 'I'm throwing up. Would you like to hold my head?'&quot;    Another secretary said her boss changes the time on the office clock so she'll work an extra 10 minutes at the end of the day. &quot;I'm smarter now,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I bring a watch. When he says, 'Leaving early?' I respond, 'Nice try.'&quot;    Everyone, of course, has a story to tell. And what makes this advice business so captivating is that it's not exactly my column, it's everyone else's. </TEXT></DOC>
