Measurements were taken at a facility for manufacturing boatswhere the production process included spraying a catalyzed resin solutionalong with chopped fiberglass onto a mold. The average background airconcentration was 18mg/m{sup 3}. The personal exposure concentrationswere: nose, 327mg/m{sup 3}; left lapel, 365mg/m{sup 3}; right lapel,388mg/m{sup 3}; and chest, 430mg/m{sup 3}. Factors affecting the concentrationin the breathing zone included air-flow patterns, the hood face velocity,and the position of the worker relative to the hood and relative to thespray gun. Styrene, being a volatile and reactive compound, may undergophysical and chemical changes such as vaporization, oxidation and polymerization,any of which would cause underestimation if they occurred following thesample collection. Samples collected on charcoal were stable up to 4weeks in storage.</TEXT></DOC>
