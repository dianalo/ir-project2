The state said that Minneapolis-based First Bank won a bidding process in which two out-of-state banks will be allowed to acquire Colorado banks if they help depositors of the state's 14 failed industrial banks. The state said First Bank has long expressed an interest in having a presence in Colorado.    Deposits of about $43 million are tied up in the failed banks, which are state-chartered thrifts with deposits that are privately guaranteed.    However, the private fund set up to insure the state's 80 industrial banks has been insolvent since the first bank failed in September. The state said all eligible depositors will share equally in the distribution of the premium based on the size of their deposits.    The state said it will consider bids for the second out-of-state bank and expects to choose an institution by Aug. 7. First Bank, under its initial bid, also was required to make one for the second phase. That bid wasn't disclosed.    In an effort to aid the industrial bank crisis, the Colorado state legislature has reorganized the state banking board and passed a law to allow out-of-state holding companies to buy Colorado banks beginning in 1991. </TEXT></DOC>
