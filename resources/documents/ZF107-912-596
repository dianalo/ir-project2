Talley.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>LettersandM;SLIP ART?andM;I was very pleased to see the indepth review of Arts andamp; Letters GraphicsEditor in your recent roundup of clip-art packages (&quot;PC-based Clip Art:Instant Images,&quot; PC Magazine, October 17, 1989).andP;  While I still beleive thatthe program should have been included in your earlier review of PCillustration packages (&quot;Fine Lines: The PC as illustrator,&quot; PC Magazine, June27, 1989), Robin Raskin's article helped atone for the omission by providingan excellent summary of Arts andamp; Letters' fine freehand drawing capabilities.andM;Unfortunately, you did your readers a big disservice by not naming it anEditor's Choice product.andP;  No other program you reviewed comes even remotelyclose to this package in terms of features, speed, compatibility,flexibility, or ease-of-use.andM;Furthermore, your conclusion that &quot;no one clip-art package will satisfy allneeds, not to mention all tastes&quot; was a huge copout.andP;  If you took thisattitude in your other reviews, then you would never award an Editor'sChoice: certainly no spreadsheet or word processing program will satisfy allneeds and tastes.andM;Bill Bailey Detroit, MichiganandM;If you felt that your review of Arts andamp; Letters Graphics Editor in the October17, 1989, issue of PC Magazine would quiet the complaints about your neglectsome months ago, let me disabuse you.andM;Reviewing Arts andamp; Letters as a source of clip art is equivalent to reviewing aPS/2 as a paperweight, or the space shuttle as accommodation for a smallgroup of tourists.andP;  Either will serve in the reviewed capacity--as Arts andamp;Letters provides an extensive and exceptional supply of graphics.andP;  Butneither is primarily used for the cited function.andM;Let me add one more criticism of your review: faulting Arts andamp; Letters forproducing blue graphics indicates that your reviewer did not take the time tolearn the rudiments of the program.andP;  One can select the color, shading, andother properties of any graphic either at creation or at any later time.andP;  Byleaving the choice to the designer, Computer Support Corp. has ensured thatmaximum flexibility is readily at hand for any user.andM;Michael Richter Los Angeles, CaliforniaandM;PC Magazine's clip-art roundup included not only clip-art packages, butgraphics packages that offer clip-art libraries; these included Arts andamp;Letters Graphics Editor, Freelance Maps, Harvard Graphics Accessories, andMicrographx ClipArt Libraries.andP;  In the reviews, the graphics and drawfeatures of these packages were discussed only in terms of their usefulnessfor modifying each product's clip art.andM;In her review of Arts andamp; Letters, Robin Raskin correctly stated that the colorfor most of the clip-art images is blue, and that the color can be modifiedmanually.andP;  She criticized this color choice because blue maps poorly toblack-and-white output devices.andM;The Editor's Choice sidebar recommends the best clip-art package in each ofseveral categories because of the unique nature of the subject.andP;  Unlike wordprocessors, for example, clip arts is characterized by style.andP;  One packagemay offer the largest number of images or the greatest variety of options,but if the library's illustrations are the wrong style for your company'snewsletter the package is of no use.andM;CHILD PRODIGYandM;Sure, the Prodigy Interactive Service is slow, less flexible than one wouldlike, and pitched at the technologically unsophisticated (After Hours, PCMagazine, October 17, 1989).andP;  But I can do virtually everything on Prodigythat I could do on CompuServe, and at a small fraction of the cost.andP;  I stilluse CompuServe for downloads and to access PC MagNet, but using Prodigy formost of my on-line information retrieval and travel planning has saved me asmall fortune.andP;  For that, I will put up with facile GUIs and a slight drop inspeed.andM;And just to let you know, I use Prodigy with a number of TSRs and devicedrivers loaded and have had no problems at all.andM;David Welch Cambridge, MassachusettsandM;I agree completely with Lori Grunin's review of the Prodigy InteractiveService.andP;  One shortcoming she failed to mention, however, is that if you wantto go to Prodigy while already using your computer, you need to shut down orreboot from the floppy disk.andP;  I can't see too many users wanting to do that.andM;Your other comments regarding Prodigy's RAM use and lack of innovation areright on target.andP;  I purchased the Starter Kit, read the documentation, andimmediately called to cancel.andP;  After I had explained my reasons for nottaking the service (in detail), the operator--who apprently knew nothingabout computers--said, &quot;So you're canceling because it's too difficult touse?&quot;andP;  I said &quot;right&quot; and hung up.andM;Lew Pinsker Flemington, New JerseyandM;Your review of the Prodigy Interactive Service indicated that stockinformation cannot be printed.andP;  In fact, it can.andP;  There is a print option onall Quote Track screens.andM;Orrin S. Edwards Mineola, New YorkandM;As Edwards and several other readers have pointed out, the Quote Trackservice on Prodity allows you to print out stock information; at review time,however, this capability was not available.andP;  On-line services change morequickly than we can reflect, and Prodigy is no exception.andM;A TALE OF TWO MARKETSandM;John C. Dvorak tells us that 386 and 486 machines can no longer be held backby 8088 code (Inside Track, PC Magazine, October 17, 1989), and that by 1990or 1991 there will be two distinct PC markets.andP;  Well, what exactly does hethink the existing market is?andP;  Homogeneous?andM;The proliferation of packages written specifically for the 386 machine hasalready split the PC market between the office configuration--in our case,PS/2 Model 70s--and the home market, made up primarily of ATs and XTs.andP;  Thereare, at this very moment, too many things that I can do at the office thatare not readily transportable to the home PC.andP;  I can see the two distinctmarkets now, and while it is not particularly comforting to know that theintroduction of the 486 will further polarize the two segments, at least itwill have the beneficial effect of pushing 386 prices (eventually) toward thehome market range.andM;Tom Palermo Kingwood, TexasandM;SETTING THE STANDARDandM;I enjoyed John Dvorak's column on the software compatibility dilemma (John C.andO;Dvorak, PC Magazine, October 17, 1989).andP;  I even agreed with most of what hesaid.andP;  However, Mr. Dvorak snuck in a very broad comparison of IBM and Compaqin order to support his theory as to why the compatibility dilemma exists.andO;What he said was, &quot;Compaq hasn't the engineering wizardy of IBM.&quot;andM;I will not deny that Compaq does not possess the depth of IBM's computerknowledge.andP;  But what is important to remember is that we are talking aboutthe PC market here.andP;  This is the same market in which IBM bought a chip fromIntel and told Bill Gates to write an OS to make it work (a slightlyoversimplified explanation).andP;  Thus was born the IBM Personal Computer.andP;  Therewere better machines out there at the time, but not one with such a vastamount of software written for it.andP;  Then, when everyone started to do abetter job than IBm with AT-bus-based computers (for example, Compaq), BigBlue abandoned that platform for another that has yet to prove itself asbetter.andP;  And Compaq went on to spearhead the EISA movement.andM;The real issue here is the ability to enforce a standard, and in this marketno company seems to be great enough to do that anymore.andP;  IBM set a standardwith its original PC not because of its engineering wizardy but because ofits marketing wizardy.andP;  It built a rather unrevolutionary PC and coupled itwith a &quot;follow us or else&quot; attitude, and we bought it.andP;  That may never happenagain.andM;Earl H. Browning III Richardson, TexasandM;ACCOUNTING FOR SUITABILITYandM;As soon as I received my September 26, 1989, issue of PC Magazine, I quicklyturned to your review of LAN-based accounting systems (&quot;LAN AccountingSoftware: Up to Speed on the PC Platform&quot;).andP;  As a financial systemsconsultant who specializes in helping large businesses decentralize theiraccounting systems, I was eager to read your reviews of the top accountingsoftware products.andM;I thought you were headed in the right direction when the article began bydiscussing &quot;enterprise accounting.&quot;andP;  It has been our experience thatselecting accounting software for departments of large companies revolvesaround the management-reporting capabilities of the package rather than thefinancial reporting.andM;However, I was disappointed that you did not follow through with thisapproach.andP;  The individual product reviews did not discuss much beyond thepackages' standard list of features.andP;  And nowhere in the review of eachpackage did you give any basis for your rating on the &quot;Suitability to Task&quot;chart.andP;  I would like to have seen more emphasis on the reporting capabilitiesof each package, for this important feature should have provided the basisfor your ratings.andM;Deborah A. Richman South Norwalk, ConnecticutandM;ONE DISK, MANY BACKUPSandM;Your recent reviews of backup programs (&quot;Backup Software: For the MomentAfter,&quot; PC Magazine, August 1989) lack one critical item that should be inyour features table: namely, the question of whether the program can appendbackup files to a previous backup disk.andP;  I presently use &quot;lowly&quot; DOS backupand need only about 10 disks for two months of incremental backup.andP;  I don'twant to have to use 25 disks just because a so-called advanced backup programforces me to use a fresh disk for each incremental backup.andM;Brian Peck Milwaukee, WisconsinandM;While the feature in question was indeed absent from the features table, wemade a point of noting in the reviews whether or not a program allows you toappend the disks used in previous backups.andP;  Fastback Plus and IntelligentBackup--our two Editor's Choices--and others (including Bakup and BackEZ)offer this capability.andM;STAR TECHandM;I left the PC retail channel in favor of working for a VAR about a year and ahalf ago, owing to many of the reasons outlined in your recent series ofcolumns on computer dealers (PC Magazine, September 12, 1989).andP;  Regardless ofthese reasons, my two years' experience working at a large retail store as atechnician gave me a closer and different vantage point than you might haveof the situation.andM;My biggest objection to the columns that appeared in PC Magazine is the lackof attention that was given to the role of the technical departments ofretailers.andP;  True, these departments are oftentimes the havens of &quot;sleepytechnicians,&quot; but when tech departments are made the dynamic sales tools theycan be, great things will happen.andM;During my retail experience, I saw the top salespeople use my abilities as anasset, not just a service.andP;  These salespeople took me with them on theirsales calls and helped me to realize how much I could do for our clients.andO;One salesperson's favorite tactic was to ask me, in front of the client as Istripped his machine, &quot;Why did Brand X computer maker do that?&quot;andP;  Not only didthis make my presence and knowledge apparent to the client before his fileserver went down, it made him more comfortable purchasing his systems fromus.andM;Technical departments need to be involved in the sales effort as an activeresource, not a last-ditch backup.andM;W.andP;  Talley Fritsch Houston, Texas</TEXT></DOC>
