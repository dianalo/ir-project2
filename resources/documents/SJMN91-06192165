And I want to assure all the people ofthis city that we're going to respond as quickly as we can. . . . We're goingto use all the means at our disposal that we can to bring down the crime andviolence.&quot;;    Then, as Mayor Tom Bradley and other city officials thought hewould finally announce his departure, Gates vowed not to leave.;    &quot;Myfeeling is that one day I do want to retire. There's no question about that,&quot;the chief said. &quot;After 13 years of being battered and pushed and otherwisetormented, that is a long, long time.;    &quot;But the support that I have withinthis organization and the community has been outstanding, and I'm not going tojust run away.&quot;;    But Police Commissioner Stanley Sheinbaum suggested thatthe scathing report of police department management was a signal to Gates thathis time is up. &quot;He knows as well as I do what the tea leaves read,&quot; Sheinbaumsaid.;    Against this backdrop, Gates and his advisers decided to entertainno questions. Sources who said Gates and his confidantes decided it was bestfor Gates to make a positive statement about the good work of the policedepartment, and to emphasize that only a handful of rogue officers are engagedin misconduct.;    &quot;We decided to go out there, stand tough and be like Gen.MacArthur,&quot; one source said. &quot;Inside, he has a lot of anger and you wouldn'twant to come across to the general public as angry.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910710  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  406  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 10, 199100192165,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
