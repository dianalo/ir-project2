<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-40-0185 </DOCNO><TEXT>Examines a technical proposal of the NIPKI Promishlena Energetika Institutefor the utilization of waste heat at the Gylybovo coal briquetting plant.Installation of appropriate heat exchangers should enable the utilizationof waste heat from 24 pipe-type coal dryers estimated at 14.6 GJ/h or3.5 Gcal/h (or 4 MW). Each of these 24 dryers emits 35,000 kg of gasper hour at a temperature of 100 C, +/- 5 C, and 380 g, +/- 30 g, ofwater steam/kg. An initial project envisaging the utilization of 1/3of the waste heat (equal to a 1.4 MW unit) was prepared in 1983. Onesketch and two photographs of this waste heat utilizing facility arepresented along with a description of thermodynamic phenomena. A pilotwaste heat utilization unit was installed in October 1986 at the Gylybovocoal briquetting plant. The initial one-stage heat exchangers were replacedduring experimental operation of the pilot installation by two-stageheat exchangers, achieving increased efficiency. According to thermodynamicand economic calculations, the investment in the waste heat utilizingfacility will be paid back within 12 months.</TEXT></DOC>
