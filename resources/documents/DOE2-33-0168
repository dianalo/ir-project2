Prospects on a mean-term basis show that natural uranium suppliesare ensured, at favourable purchaser prices. Concluded contracts fornew nuclear power plant indicate a better plant capacity utilizationin uranium production to be attainable by the 1990s. Conversion capacity,however, is expected to remain as excessive as presently for quite along period still, although reprocessing produces increasing amountsof recovered uranium to be converted. The capacity for uranium separativework is favourable for the customers. Existing and projected productionfacilities already today ensure safe supplies beyond the turn of themillenium, under conditions by far better in terms of long-term competingenergy sources.</TEXT></DOC>
