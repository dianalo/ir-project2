Background and Substance of Petition</ITAG>OSMRE received a letter on June 20, 1989, from Mr. J. Nathan Noland, Presidentof the Indiana Coal Council, Inc., 701 Harrison Bldg., W. Market St., Indianapolis,Indiana, as a petition for rulemaking to revise 30 CFR 715.13(d). Mr. Nolandsuggested that the postmining land use requirements of 30 CFR 715.13(d)applicable to operations permitted under the initial regulatory programbe replaced with the postmining land use requirements for operations permittedunder the permanent regualtory program at 30 CFR 816.133.(c).SMCRA was signed into law on August 3, 1977. Section 502 of the Act authorizedthe establishment of an Initial Regulatory Program under which surfacecoal mining operations would be regulated pending the establishment ofa more comprehensive Permanent Program. The regulations implementing theInitial Program were published in final on December 13, 1977 (42 FR 62639).Final Permanent Program regulations, which differ from their Initial Programcounterparts in some significant respects, were promulgated on March 13,1979 (44 FR 14901), and subsequently revised in part in 1983 and later.Although the Permanent Program rules have been in effect for some time,the Initial Program rules continue to apply to operators who are actingpursuant to permits received under the Initial Program.Under section 201(g) of SMCRA, any person may petition the Director ofOSMRE to initiate a proceeding for the issuance, amendment, or repeal ofany of the regulations implementing SMCRA. Under the applicable regulationsfor rulemaking petitions, 30 CFR 700.12, this notice seeks public commenton the merits of the petition and on the rule changes suggested in thepetition.At the close of the comment period, a decision will be made whether togrant or deny the petition. Under 30 CFR 700.12, the Director shall issuea written decision either granting or denying the petition within 90 daysof the date of its receipt. Soon thereafter, notice of that decision willbe published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> If the petition is granted, rulemaking proceedingswill be initiated in which public comment will again be sought before anyfinal rulemaking notice appears. If the petition is denied, no furtherrulemaking action will occur pursuant to the petition.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Procedural Matters</ITAG>Publication of this notice of the receipt of the petition for rulemakingis a preliminary step in the rulemaking process. If a decision is madeto grant the petition, a formal rulemaking process will be initiated. Thus,no regulatory flexibility analysis is needed at this stage, nor is a regulatoryimpact analysis necessary under Executive Order 12291.Publication of this notice does not constitute a major Federal action havinga significant effect on the human environment for which an environmentalimpact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act, 44 U.S.C.4322(a)(C), is needed.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 715</ITAG>Environmental protection, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Surfacemining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 29, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert H.

Nathan Noland, is as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This is a petition to the Director of the Office of Surface Mining(``OSM'') pursuant to 30 U.S.C. section 1211(g) and 30 CFR 700.12 to initiaterulemaking to amend a regulation promulgated under the Surface Mining Controland Reclamation Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95-87, 30 U.S.C. section 1201 et seq.(``SMCRA'').</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Petitioner</T3>_The Petitioner is the Indiana Coal Council, Inc. TheIndiana Coal Council is a trade association representing approximatelyninety percent of Indiana's coal production. The association was formedto foster, promote, and defend the interests of Indiana's coal producers,coal reserve holders, and other business entities related to the coal industry.All of our members would presently or prospectively affected in the operationof their existing and planned mining operations by the regulations adoptedunder SMCRA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Proposed Amendment</T3>_Petitioner proposes that 30 CFR 715.13 be amendedby deleting existing subsection (d) and replacing it with the languagecontained in 30 CFR 816.133(c).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Justification and Proposed amendment</T3>_Existing 30 CFR 715.13, theinterim rule governing postmining land uses, was adopted in 1977, 42 FR62680 (December 13, 1977) and has not been significantly revised sincethat date. Subsection (d) of the rule contains a detailed list of criteriafor approval of postmining land uses different than the premining landuse.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The permanent program regulations governing alternate postmining landuse approval is 30 CFR 816.133. This rule was originally adopted in 1979containing a subsection (c) similar to 30 CFR 715.13(d). 44 FR 14901 (March13, 1979). In 1982, OSM proposed to amend 30 CFR 816.133(d), explainingas follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In originally establishing the criteria for approval of alternativepostmining land uses in existing andSection; 816.133(c) in 1979, OSM incorporatedthe detailed requirements of sections 515(c) and 515(e) of the Act thatare mandated only for mountain-top removal and for AOC variances. OSM statedat that time ``that a composite of these concepts is a reasonable approachto setting forth the regulatory requirements for approval of proposed postminingland uses'' (44 FR at 15243).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``While OSM believed in 1979 that the composite approach offers sufficientflexibility to operators and regulatory authorities, based on its experienceOSM no longer believes that such detailed requirements are practicable.Proposed andSection; 816.133(c) would impose the standards of section 515(b)(2)of the Act as the general criteria for allowing higher or better uses asalternative postmining land uses. The inflexible, overly detailed and burdensomerequirements of existing andSection; 816.133(c) would be eliminated.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">47 FR 16152, 16154 (April 14, 1982).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In 1983, OSM adoped the proposal as a final rule with minor changes.In finalizing the rule, OSM reiterated its position that the detailed criteriaof the former rule were inappropriate, rejecting comments that some orall of the provisions of former 30 CFR 816.133 be retained. 48 FR 39898-39899(September 1, 1983).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In revising the permanent program postmining land use regulation in1982-1983, OSM did not make or propose any change to 30 CFR 715.13, thecorresponding interim program rule. Neither the preamble to the proposedor final rule amending the permanent program regulation discusses the interimrule or gives any indication why corresponding changes were not made tothe interim rule. The result is that the interim rule continues to includedetailed requirements for approval of alternate postmining land uses whichOSM has found to be inappropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In any event, OSM's reasoning in the 1983 permanent program rulemaking,that it is inappropriate to impose upon all mining operations the mountain-topremoval and steep slope provisions for alternative post mining land use,30 U.S.C. 1265 (c) and (e), applies equally to the interim program. Instead,the requirements found in section 515(b)(2) apply as indicated in section502(c) of SMCRA. Moreover, the change requested also finds support in thedecision in <T3>MWF </T3>v. <T3>Hodel</T3>, 839 F.2d 694 (D.C. Cir. 1988), where the court of appealsheld in several contexts that specific provisions could not be expandedfor general application. For instance, the court held that section 515(e)steep slope provisions could not be applied to non-steep slopes. Similarly,the court reversed the district court's interpretation that section 515(f)required design standards for all coal mine waste in view of its limitedapplicability to waste piles used for dams or embankments. The appealscourt also refused to imply any authority to impose additional requirementsupon mine operators where another provision specifically addressed theissue. For example, highwalls submerged below the waterline of permanentimpoundments are permissible under the specific provisions of section 515(b)(8),and highwall elimination would not be implied under the general gradingprovision of section 515(b)(3). Nor can water replacement be imposed uponunderground coals mines through the permit application provisions of section508(a) when section 717(b) specifically requires replacement by only surfacemines.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In sum, section 502(c) specifically references the provisions of section515 (c) and (e) requirements in the alternative postmining land use provisionfor the interim program was erroneous and must be corrected to conformthe rules to the express language of SMCRA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Public Hearing._</T3>The Petitioner does not request a public hearing,but reserves the right to submit comment at any public hearing which maybe held. A draft of the proposed amendment is attached.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If you require any further information, please contact the undersigned.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Very truly yours,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Indiana Coal Council, Inc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">J.
