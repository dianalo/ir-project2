Arkin, co-author of thereport by the Greenpeace environmental group, which favorsnuclear-free seas, and the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberalresearch group.   Using data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, thegroups found that more than 2,000 major peacetime naval accidentshave occurred since 1945 resulting in some 2,800 deaths. Theaccidents ranged from the loss of an entire vessel and crew tominor collisions and fires that left little damage and someinjuries.   The researchers omitted incidents that occurred during theVietnam and Korean Wars and in the Persian Gulf during theIran-Iraq war, Arkin said.   Since World War II, 10 U.S. and Soviet accidents and a decisionby the United States to intentionally scuttle one reactor, haveleft 50 sunken warheads and nine reactors on the ocean floor.Forty-three of the 50 warheads and six of the nine reactors areSoviet.   The report specifically details 1,276 accidents, including theSoviet Mike-class submarine that sank in the Norwegian Sea on April7 with two nuclear tipped torpedoes and two nuclear reactors aboard.   The most serious incident apparently was the sinking of a SovietYankee-class submarine with 32 nuclear warheads and two nucleartorpedoes aboard. The sinking occurred 600 miles northeast ofBermuda on Oct. 6, 1986.   But Arkin said the number of nuclear weapons on the ocean floormay be higher because ``we are ascribing only two nuclear torpedoesto each Soviet submarine. They could, of course, have more.''   Arkin said researchers received no information from the SovietUnion for their study and when ``we asked the (U.S.) intelligencecommunity to provide us with their analysis of Soviet accidents,they declined to do so on the basis of security.''   The report found that of the accidents, 228 involved aircraftcarriers, 406 other major surface warships, 182 supply ships, 142minor military ships and 75 amphibious vessels.   Seventy-five incidents involved sinkings. Of these, 27 weresubmarines _ five of them Soviet, four American, four French andthree British, as well as submarines from West Germany, Israel,Pakistan, Peru, Spain and Turkey.   ``In accident after accident after accident, human failure isthe responsible cause,'' Arkin said.   In addition, about 30 percent of the 1,276 accidents occurred inports, possibly endangering civilians nearby, said Joshua Handler,the report's other co-author and a researcher with Greenpeace. Ofthose accidents, 624 occurred in the Atlantic Ocean, 318 in thePacific, 110 in the Mediterranean Sea and 34 in the Indian Ocean.   Greenpeace earlier revealed information about two U.S. accidentsthat received wide publicity over the past month. In 1965, an A-4warplane fell off the USS Ticonderoga near Okinawa with a hydrogenbomb aboard, and on Nov. 22, 1975, a fire aboard the USS Belknapcame within 40 feet of nuclear weapons.   Arkin said he suspected that the sinking of a Soviet destroyerin the Black Sea in 1974 involved nuclear weapons or reactors, butsaid that has never been verified. Holding up a Russian-languageversion of the study, he said a copy would be delivered to theSoviet Embassy in Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
