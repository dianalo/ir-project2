And Harvard UniversityProf. Robert Reich, among a chorus of academics, professesthat only the &quot;most fortunate fifth&quot; of Americans -- thosewith &quot;princely incomes&quot; (or households with more than $55,205in annual earnings in 1990) -- improved their economicstation during the past two decades. He argues that justiceand economy demand that the growing hardship of the lowerfour-fifths of income earners be relieved with whopping taxincreases on the rich.   Myriad versions of these claims have often been fortifiedwith citations of official data on real median family incomeand on shares of income going to each of the five quintilesof households. Real median family income, adjusted forinflation using the standard consumer price index (CPI), andset relative to the 1970 level, did trend downward from 1970to the late 1980s.</LP><TEXT>   Fortunately, the reality of the changing incomedistribution is far more complicated than the modern prophetsof gloom would have us believe. As rarely conceded, the realmedian family income began to rebound after 1982. Moreover,this measure of the real median is defective in three keyways: (1) the method for computing the CPI was changed in1983, the effect of which was to obscure the growth in realincomes; (2) the average family size fell by 17% between 1970and 1986; and (3) fringe benefits and other wage supplements,which are not counted as family income, expanded from 12% oftotal wages and salaries in 1970 to 20% in 1986.   Researchers at the Congressional Budget Office havedetermined that when the real median income is recomputedwith a consistent consumer price index (the so-called CPI-X)and adjusted for the economies associated with smallerfamilies, the real median family income trends upward, risingby 20% between 1970 and 1986. When real median income isfurther adjusted to account, in a rough way, for the growthin nonwage income, the rise during this period may be morethan 28%.   While such revised data seriously undercut the critics'empirical props, they have a ready-made comeback: The medianrose only because the rising economic tide &quot;lifted theyachts, but neither the tugboats nor the rowboats.&quot;   Critics do have some of the facts on the changing incomedistribution right. The share of total income going to thequintile of households with the lowest incomes did fall from4.1% in 1970 to 3.9% in 1990 (after reaching 4.2% in 1980),and the share of income received by the middle threequintiles fell from 52.7% in 1970 to 49.5% in 1990. At thesame time, the quintile of households with the highestincomes rose relatively rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s,with their share of income rising from 43.3% in 1970 to 46.6%in 1990.   The data do offer the surface appearance of a &quot;mostfortunate fifth.&quot; But appearances are deceiving. CensusBureau data reveal that the real mean incomes (adjusted onlyfor inflation by the CPI-X) of every quintile of householdstrended upward during the 1970s and 1980s. These data aloneindicate that it is grossly misleading to suggest thatchanges in the income distribution were &quot;seismic&quot; or that thepoor as a group got poorer, or that only the &quot;most fortunatefifth&quot; gained over the past decade or two.   Critics of the changing income distribution delight incomparing current real household income of quintiles with the1970s peak achieved in 1973, prior to the first oil-supplyshock that helped throttle income growth for the rest of thedecade. They stress that the real income of the lowest twoquintiles fell between 1973 and the late 1980s, rarely notingthe flaw in the price index or the need to make otheradjustments for decreasing household size and increasingnonwage benefits. In addition, the relatively strong growthin real household income in the middle and late 1980s isnever mentioned, mainly because such an acknowledgementundercuts the simplistic claim that the downward trend wasall Ronald Reagan's fault.   The average incomes of the lowest two quintiles ofhouseholds rose a modest 4.7% and 4%, respectively, between1973 and 1989 (just before the current recession) using theCPI-X as the deflator. And that's without even making otheradjustments. However, between 1983 and 1989 the averageincome of the lowest quintile rose 11.1%, while the averageincome of the second quintile rose 10.1%. The average incomeof the middle quintile expanded by 10.7% and the fourthquintile by 11.6% in the 1983-89 period.   Granted, the average real income of the top quintile roseby much more, 18.8%, but it is naive to assume that the topquintile is an exclusive club. It in fact comprises changingcollections of households with changing collections ofhousehold members operating on continually changingconditions. A student in the early 1980s, for example, hadjumped several quintiles by the end of the decade simply bytaking his first job or by marrying someone with an income.The very limited research done on the subject suggests that asizable share -- surely a third and possibly half -- of thehouseholds in the top quintile at the end of the 1980s werein a lower quintile in earlier years.   Moreover, the nature of the quintiles of householdsensures that the top quintile often grows more rapidly thanthe lower ones. People in the top quintile who increase theirproductivity and hours of work, marry (or stay married), anddecide to have a nonworking family member go to work (and 83%of the households in the top quintile have two or more incomeearners, far higher than the lower quintiles) automaticallyraise their quintile's mean household income. These peoplecannot move to a higher category.   People in any of the lower quintiles who do the same caneasily move up one or more quintiles, increasing their ownwelfare but, in the process, reducing the mean income oftheir former quintile.   Overall, the critics have been right in stressing that therich have gotten richer, but they are way off base to suggestthat the rich were always rich during the 1980s, or that theybecame richer at the expense of the rest of the population,or that their riches were all ill-gotten or undeserved. It isfar more accurate to say that in the 1980s many rich andnot-so-rich Americans got richer faster than other Americans.Some Americans in all quintiles fell behind. Both ends of theincome distribution were contributing to the economicimprovement of the other. Income growth was trickling in alldirections, not just down or up the income distribution.   Clearly, the country has experienced a host of economicproblems over the past two decades, of which decreasing realwages for some groups is one of the more important. While theavailable data do not permit an exact determination of howmany Americans lost economic ground during the past twodecades, it is clear that critics have grossly exaggeratedthe economic hardship visited on the vast majority ofAmericans. Furthermore, the critics don't seem to realizethat many of the observed changes in real wages have beeninstructive. They have caused many people to learn from theirexperience and to take corrective action -- withoutdirectives from Washington.   ---   Mr. McKenzie is a professor of management at theUniversity of California, Irvine.
