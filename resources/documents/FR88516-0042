Becausethe approvable measures in the revised plan do not by themselves providesufficient emissions reductions to demonstrate timely attainment of thecarbon monoxide (CO) standard, this notice also proposes to promulgateunder section 110(c) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) a Federal ImplementationPlan (FIP) for Maricopa County, consisting of a motor vehicle oxygenatedfuels program and an employer-based trip reduction program. EPA believesthat the revised SIP, supplemented by these two federally promulgated rules,will meet the requirements of section 110 and Part D of the Clean Air Act.The proposed combined plan provides for attainment of the CO standard bythe end of 1991, and for continued maintenance of the standard. In addition,EPA is taking comments on whether it may be appropriate to promulgate aFIP for Maricopa County based solely on a motor vehicle oxygenated fuelsprogram. This program would be implemented with a sufficiently high oxygenrequirement so that all of the CO reductions necessary for attainment bythe FIP would be achieved by the motor vehicle oxygenated fuels programand the approvable State measures. EPA is also proposing: (1) To continuethe Part D disapproval of the Maricopa CO plan that EPA announced September23, 1986 (51 FR 33746) and (2) to find that the State is not making reasonableefforts to submit an adequate Part D plan for CO for Maricopa County. Asa result, EPA is proposing to retain the construction ban for major newand modified stationary sources under section 110(a)(2)(I) and to imposein Maricopa County the federal highway funding restriction under section176(a). EPA's proposed promulgation of a FIP is in response to an order by theU.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, requiring EPA to promulgateno later than August 10, 1988, a FIP for CO in the Maricopa and Pima CountiesNonattainment Areas. On April 26, 1988, EPA proposed to approve the revisedSIP for the Tucson CO Planning Area (Pima County) as meeting the requirementsof Part D of the Act. EPA proposes in this notice that, in the event thatEPA determines that the Tucson SIP cannot be approved, EPA will promulgatean oxygenated fuels program for Pima County. Any oxygenated fuels programthat EPA ultimately would adopt for Pima County would provide for attainmentin Pima County by 1990.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>EPA will conduct a public hearing on this Notice of ProposedRulemaking (NPRM) on June 10, 1988, from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. Writtencomments on the NPRM must be submitted to EPA at the address below by June15, 1988.

Background </ITAG>The Clean Air Act (CAA) amendments of 1977 required states to revise theirstate implementation plans (SIPs) by certain times for all areas that hadnot then attained the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Generally,the states containing these designated ``nonattainment areas'' had to submitrevised SIPs by January 1, 1979. The 1979 SIP revisions were to providefor attainment of the NAAQS by December 31, 1982. An extension of the attainmentdate for ozone or carbon monoxide (CO) to no later than December 31, 1987,was available under section 172 if the state could demonstrate as partof its 1979 SIP revision that attainment by the end of 1982 was not possible,despite the implementation of all reasonably available control measures.For areas that received an attainment date extension from EPA, states wererequired to submit to EPA by July 1, 1982 an additional SIP revision thatprovided for attainment no later than December 31, 1987, and that compliedwith all other requirements of Part D of the CAA. A. SIP Disapproval Maricopa County was designated as nonattainment for CO on March 3, 1978(43 FR 8970), and the State submitted Maricopa County's initial nonattainmentarea plan for CO in 1979 and 1980. On October 30, 1980, the State submitteda request to EPA to extend the CO attainment date in Maricopa County toDecember 31, 1987. EPA proposed to approve the extension request on February5, 1982 (47 FR 5439). On May 5, 1982 (47 FR 19826), EPA took final action to approve the 1979SIP revision on the condition that the State submit revised regulationsfor Maricopa County to meet the Act's New Source Review (NSR) requirements.On June 3, 1982, and March 4, 1983, the State submitted NSR regulationsfor Maricopa County. On July 3, 1983 (48 FR 34293), EPA proposed to approvethe Maricopa rules with one exception and certain understandings. On April27, 1988, Maricopa County submitted a letter to EPA making certain commitmentsregarding implementation of the Maricopa NSR rules pursuant to those understandings.EPA expects to receive an identical commitment letter from the ArizonaDepartment of Environmental Quality in the near future. Based upon theseletters, EPA will take final action approving the NSR rules when EPA takesfinal action on today's proposal. Beyond establishing this NSR condition, EPA, in its final action on the1979 CO plan, found that the plan was not adequate to bring about attainmentby the end of 1982. EPA premised its limited approval of the plan on theexpectation that (1) the Agency would take final action to grant the State'srequest for an attainment date extension to December 31, 1987, and (2)the State would submit another plan revision which would provide for attainmentby that date. The State submitted a plan purporting to meet this requirementon October 26, 1982. On January 27, 1986 (51 FR 3343), EPA proposed to disapprove the Maricoparevised plan and impose the section 110(a)(2)(I) construction ban becausethe State had not adequately demonstrated that it would provide for timelyattainment of the standard.On September 23, 1986 (51 FR 33746), EPA published a final notice disapprovingthe CO plans for both the Maricopa and Pima Counties Nonattainment Areas,and imposing the section 110(a)(2)(I) construction ban on major new sourcesand major modifications to existing sources of CO in the two areas. Asexplained fully in the September 23, 1986 notice, EPA determined that itwas not necessary to take final action on the State's attainment-date extensionrequest. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld EPA's action. <T3>Arizona </T3>v. <T3>Thomas, </T3>829 F.2d 834 (1987). B. U.S. District Court Order On August 10, 1987, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizonaordered EPA to promulgate a federal implementation plan (FIP) under section110(c) of the Act for CO in the Maricopa and Pima Counties NonattainmentAreas. The Court found that EPA's duty to promulgate a FIP arose when EPAfound the State plans were inadequate. The Court Order is the result ofa citizen suit brought against EPA on April 8, 1985, by the Arizona Centerfor Law in the Public Interest (ACLPI). The timeframe specified in theCourt Order for EPA to promulgate a FIP was six months, following eitherthe formal submittal of the Pima CO plan or September 30, 1987, whichevercame first. <T3>McCarthy </T3>v. <T3>Thomas, </T3>D. Ariz. No. CIV-85-34-TUC-lWDB (slip op., Aug. 10, 1987).The court left open the possibility that EPA could file a motion afterJanuary 1, 1988 requesting an extension of the time period for FIP promulgationif necessary. EPA outlined its intended approach to comply with the Court Order to promulgatea FIP for Maricopa and Pima Counties in an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(ANPRM) (52 FR 45466) published on November 30, 1987. EPA received 54 commentson the ANPRM which it took into account in preparing this proposal. A fullanalysis of the comments and EPA's response to them is included in theTSD. In the ANPRM EPA explained that, to promulgate a FIP for these twoareas, EPA must select control measures that fill whatever gaps are leftby approved portions of the State plans. The ANPRM also discussed the MaricopaCounty CO plan that had been submitted as a SIP revision by the State onOctober 5, 1987. The plan indicated that the area could attain the CO standardas early as 1990 and in any event by 1995 if the recommended control strategyin the SIP, including an oxygenated fuels program for motor vehicles, winterdaylight savings time, and an employer-based trip reduction ordinance,were fully adopted and implemented. The Maricopa plan claimed credit, both implicitly and explicitly, for theArizona vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program as expanded through1987. In a separate <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice on the revised Pima CO plan, EPA recentlyproposed to approve the improvements to the State's I/M program as adoptedby the Arizona State Legislature in 1985, 1986, and 1987. (51 FR 14818(April 26, 1988).) The revised Maricopa plan also assumed credit for thefollowing additional control measures: Transit and ridesharing improvements,expanded facilities to encourage increased pedestrian and bicycle trips,alternative work hours, alternative fuels for vehicle fleets, alternate-fueledtransit vehicle purchase, and a voluntary-no-drive-day program. As discussedbelow, EPA is proposing to approve and assign emissions reduction creditto all of these measures except for the alternative fuels for vehicle fleetsand the voluntary-no-drive-day program. The approvable measures in therevised plan, however, do not by themselves provide sufficient emissionsreductions to demonstrate timely attainment of the CO standard. On March 14, 1988, EPA moved the Court to extend the period for EPA topromulgate a FIP for the Maricopa and Pima areas. On April 19, 1988, theCourt issued an order requiring EPA to propose a FIP for Maricopa Countyno later than May 13, 1988, hold public hearings on the proposal no laterthan June 10, 1988, c1ose the public comment period following the hearingby July 11, 1988, and promulgate a FIP for Maricopa County no later thanAugust 10, 1988. The Court also ordered that the same schedule for FIPpromulgation shall apply for Pima County if EPA does not accept the PimaCounty SIP. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of EPA's Proposal </ITAG>Section 110(c)(1) of the Act provides that the Administrator shall promulgatea FIP within the statutory schedule unless, prior to such promulgation,the state has adopted and submitted a plan which the Administrator determinesto be in accordance with the requirements of section 110. While EPA believesthat expeditious attainment of the standards would result if the approvablemeasures in the revised plan were supplemented by an appropriate Stateoxygenated fuels program alone or in conjunction with a local trip reductionprogram, the State Legislature and the local Maricopa County jurisdictionshave not yet adopted such programs. Thus, EPA believes that the revisedMaricopa plan does not at this time relieve the Agency of the responsibilityto promulgate a FIP for Maricopa. As discussed in the ANPRM, EPA has evaluatedmeasures that could fill the gaps left by the State plan and thereby bringabout near-term attainment of the CO standard. In this notice, EPA proposesto promulgate the two control measures for Maricopa County identified inthe ANPRM_an oxygenated fuels program and an employer-based trip reductionprogram_as technologically-available elements of the FIP to provide theemissions reduction necessary for attainment.With respect to oxygenated fuels, EPA proposes to require an equivalentoxygen content level of 2.57 percent in motor vehicle fuels first introducedinto commerce within the Maricopa area in the winter CO season_specifically,from October 1 through March 31. (The equivalent oxygen content requirementmay change in the final rulemaking depending on the combination of controlmeasures selected for promulgation and on whether the State adopts anyadditional control measures.) Oxygen fuel blends, in the form of aliphaticalcohols and/or ethers, which are currently on the market and availableto the Maricopa area, include methyl-tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE), ethanol(Gasohol), and methanol/cosolvent blends. The effect of these blends ingasoline is to cause motor vehicle engines to run leaner thereby reducingemissions of carbon monoxide. With respect to the proposed federal trip reduction regulation, EPA proposesto require that each employer of 100 or more employees at a worksite inthe nonattainment area develop and offer to his employees alternative modesincentives. These incentives would be designed to reduce the number ofsingle-occupant-vehicle (SOV) commute trips to the employer's worksite.The proposed trip reduction goal is a 5 percent reduction in SOV commutetrips in the first year and an additional 5 percent reduction in the secondyear. Both the proposed trip reduction program and the oxygenated fuelsprogram are discussed in detail later in this notice. While these two measures are being proposed, EPA intends to give considerationbetween proposal and final promulgation to the implementation of FIP basedupon a single control measure_an oxygenated fuels requirement with a sufficientlyhigh oxygen requirement (2.79 percent) so that attainment can be achievedsolely based upon this measure. In essence, with a sufficiently high oxygencontent in the motor vehicle oxygenated fuels program the trip reductionprogram would become unnecessary. Since EPA has not promulgated either of these measures before, EPA hasvery little experience regarding the advantages and disadvantages of implementingone measure over the other. Consequently, the final decision of whetherto promulgate a trip reduction regulation or whether to rely on a morestringent oxygenated fuels program and no trip reduction regulation willbe made after EPA reviews comments received on all parts of this proposal.EPA believes that the combination of approved SIP measures and the proposedFIP measures will result in attainment of the CO standards in 1991. Asdiscussed in full below, EPA believes that the attainment date that appliesto the Maricopa area, now that both of the Part D statutory dates havepassed, is the date that is the most expeditious date practicable but nolater than three years from the date EPA promulgates this FIP. For thereasons described below, EPA believes that the 1991 date selected for theMaricopa CO FIP meets this test. The Arizona State Legislature is currently considering several bills thatwould establish oxygenated fuels programs of varying degrees of stringencyin Maricopa County. In addition, the Legislature is debating adoption oflegislation aimed at achieving CO emission reductions through mandatorydecreases in allowable wintertime gasoline volatility and by improvementsto the existing motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program, includinginitiation of a loaded mode testing requirement, and a trip reduction ordinancesimilar to that adopted by Pima County. Finally, additional CO emissionsreductions may be achieved in the near future from the adoption of theMAG model trip reduction ordinance by Maricopa jurisdictions. State submittal of any one of these control measures or a combination ofthese measures as a SIP may occur before EPA's final promulgation of federalcontrol measures. EPA proposes that, if before EPA takes final action onthis FIP proposal, the State submits measures with sufficient emissionreductions to demonstrate expeditious attainment and maintenance of theCO NAAQS, then EPA will approve those measures in lieu of final FIP promulgation.If additional control measures are submitted before FIP promulgation, butthe measures do not completely eliminate the shortfall in CO emissionsreductions, EPA will adjust the FIP by either eliminating altogether asuperfluous federal control measure or relaxing the stringency of the measuresso long as neither expeditious attainment nor maintenance of the standardwould be jeopardized. Thus, for example, EPA's proposed oxygenated fuelsprogram might be amended in the final promulgation to mandate a lower oxygen-contentrequirement if the higher oxygen content were no longer necessary, or theTRO program may be eliminated, in light of the State's supplemental submittal.The emission reductions achievable by the measures under considerationin Arizona, and some of the possible amendments to EPA's proposed oxygenatedfuels rule are discussed below in Section VI, ``Effect on Proposal of anyFuture SIP Submittal by Arizona.'' Should the state submit added controlmeasures after final EPA promulgation of the FIP, EPA will approve thosemeasures and rescind (or amend as appropriate) any EPA regulations thatare deemed unnecessary based upon the State revised submittal. With the exceptions specified below, EPA proposes to approve under sections110(a)(2)(B) and 172(b)(8) of the Act, the control measures adopted bythe State and MAG since the measures would not interfere with timely attainmentof the CO standard and, indeed, are necessary for attainment. EPA proposesto conclude, however, that the Maricopa CO plan does not, absent furthersupplement by the relevant governments in Arizona, provide for attainmentof the CO standards. EPA, therefore, proposes to continue the Part D disapprovalof the CO plan for Maricopa County and the federal ban on constructionof major new or modified stationary sources of CO and to impose the section176(a) highway funding sanctions until the Agency approves a state planas adequate to meet the Part D requirements. EPA believes that the construction ban contained in section 110(a)(2)(I)should remain in place in an area until such time as a state submits andEPA subsequently approves a plan meeting the requirements of Part D, notwithstandingthe fact that EPA may promulgate its own plan for the area that meets therequirements of Part D. As a statutory matter, the construction ban iscontained in section 110(a), which governs plans submitted by the states.The reference in section 110(a)(2)(I) to the need for a construction banunless ``such plan'' meets the requirements of Part D is to the plan referredto in section 110(a)(1), the plan required to be submitted by a state.In addition, EPA's regulations at 40 CFR 52.24 clearly impose the constructionban until such time as a state plan meeting the requirements of Part Dis approved by the Administrator. Finally, the primary policy reason forwhich Congress created the section 110(a)(2)(I) construction ban was toencourage states to promptly prepare and submit to EPA plans meeting therequirements of Part D. EPA was to promulgate plans under section 110(c)for states only where states failed to comply with their statutory dutiesto prepare adequate plans. It would thus be inconsistent with the Act'spurpose to reward these states by lifting the construction ban when EPAprepares a plan for them meeting the requirements of Part D. Although theplan for an area would then meet Part D, there would remain strong policygrounds for continuing the construction ban. The implementation of airpollution control measures in an area is always facilitated if carriedout at the state level, and clearly Congress intended such planning andimplementation to be done by the states. Thus, although an area would progresstowards attainment under a federally promulgated plan, the constructionban would remain in place to encourage the state to complete its own planmeeting the requirements of Part D and eventually substitute it for thefederal plan. EPA specifically solicits comment on this interpretationof section 110(a)(2)(I). Although the Arizona State and local governments have taken substantialsteps in recent months to supplement the previous State CO SIP submittalsfor the Maricopa area, EPA has no assurance at this time that they willcomplete action on these supplements. As a result, EPA believes it is appropriateto lay the groundwork now for imposing the additional sanctions providedby section 176(a) of the Clean Air Act should the Arizona governments ultimatelyfail to adopt the necessary control measures. For this reason, EPA is proposingtoday that, if Arizona does not supplement the Maricopa plan with the measuresnecessary to demonstrate expeditious attainment, EPA will make a finalfinding that the State is not making reasonable efforts to submit an adequatePart D plan. That finding would be based on the State's failure to adoptmeasures that are necessary to produce attainment of the standard in theMaricopa area. For a further discussion of the criteria EPA would use tomake this finding final, see EPA's Notice of Intent on the subject (51FR 4934 (February 10, 1986)) and EPA's November 30, 1987, ANPRM (52 FR45466). Upon making such a final finding, the federal highway funding restrictionof section 176(a) would go into effect.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Pub. L. 100-202, signed into law December 22, 1987, prohibitsEPA from imposing certain sanctions under the Clean Air Act, includingthe section 176(a) funding restriction, during a moratorium extending throughAugust 30, 1988. Therefore, while EPA is today proposing to make a finalfinding regarding such sanctions should fail to supplement the Maricopaplan, any final action on the sanctions would not go into effect any earlierthan August 31, 1988. With respect to the implementation plan for Pima County, the emission reductionsneeded for attainment in the Pima County area are significantly less thanneeded for  attainment by the end of 1991 in the Maricopa County area.EPA, therefore, believes that an oxygenated fuels program no more stringentthan that proposed in this notice for the Maricopa area, if applied inthe Pima area, would provide for attainment of the CO standard in PimaCounty. Accordingly, EPA intends to rely upon the oxygenated fuels programset forth in this Notice as the most stringent proposed FIP that EPA mightpromulgate for Pima County in the event that EPA determines, after theclose of the comment period on the proposed Pima SIP approval (53 FR 14818(April 26, 1988)), that the Pima SIP cannot be approved. EPA thereforesolicits comment on such a program as a FIP for Pima County. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Legal Requirements </ITAG>Section 110(c)(1) requires EPA to prepare regulations ``setting forth animplementation plan, or portion thereof, for a state'' when a state hasfailed to submit an adequate SIP. The CAA appears to indicate that suchan ``implementation plan'' must meet all of the requirements of section110(a)(2) and, where still applicable to the state's own planning effort,Part D. For example, section 110(c)(1) states that EPA must promulgatea FIP unless the state, before EPA takes final action, submits a plan ``whichthe Administrator determines to be in accordance with the requirementsof (section 110).'' This passage indicates that Congress regarded a FIPmeeting section 110 (rather than some lesser requirements) as the substitutefor a state plan meeting section 110. Beyond that, each of the predicatesfor the duty to promulgate a FIP (<T3>see </T3>section 110(c)(1)(A)-(C)) directly or indirectly relates tothe need to have some plan in place that meets the requirements of section110. Thus, it is unlikely that Congress would have intended EPA to promulgatea FIP meeting less than those requirements. Moreover, section 110(d) statesthat the applicable implementation plan for an area is the plan ``whichhas been approved under subsection (a) or promulgated under subsection(c) and which implements the requirements of this section.'' This languageimplies that all plans promulgated by the Administrator under section 110(c)must implement the requirements of section 1l0. In addition, section 110(a)(2) contains a requirement that the plans fordesignated nonattainment areas contain a construction moratorium, unlessthe plan ``meets the requirements of Part D.'' Since the Maricopa Planfor CO has never received EPA's approval as meeting Part D, this requirementstill applies to CO planning for the area. For two reasons the Part D requirementsalso seem to apply to EPA's FIP. First, the section 110(a)(2)(I) requirementfor a state plan meeting Part D is contained in section 110 which, as discussedearlier, apparently governs FIPs promulgated under section 110(c). Second,section 172(b), which contains the requirements for Part D plans, refersto plan provisions adopted by the State ``or promulgated by the Administratorunder section 110(c).'' This phrase suggests that, if an area is stillotherwise subject to Part D, any FIP required for that area also is subjectto Part D. Having concluded that any FIP that EPA promulgates for the Maricopa areashould meet the requirements of both section 110 and Part D, EPA must nextinterpret those requirements to determine how they apply to the Agency'sFIP for this area after December 31, 1987, the latest attainment date expresslyidentified in the CAA. That date is the planning date for areas that receivedEPA's approval of an extension beyond the otherwise applicable planningdate_December 31, 1982. <T3>See </T3>section 172(a). The Maricopa area has not received EPA's approvalof such an extension. However, since the later date, December 31 1987,has now elapsed as well, the discussion below analyzes both dates similarly_aselapsed Part D dates. The policy that EPA proposed on November 24, 1987 (52 FR 45044) providesbackground for today's proposal on how to apply Part D to the Arizona COplans now that the statutory dates have passed. On its face, Part D callsfor plans that ``provide for attainment'' of the standard by the stateddate (December 31, 1982, or December 31, 1987). Since plans developed after1987 cannot conceivably provide for attainment by either of these dates,under the strictest possible reading of Part D EPA could never developa plan that meets Part D's requirements, and hence, could not actuallysatisfy the applicable requirements (and the Court's Order). As explained in EPA's proposed policy, EPA does not believe that such aninterpretation of these elapsed dates would be consistent with Congress'sintent in adopting Part D, since Congress obviously called for the creationof ``plans'' for future attainment, not findings that an area could nevermeet Part D. Thus, since it will be physically impossible after 1987 forEPA to plan for these areas to attain by the elapsed dates in Part D, EPAintends to interpret the requirement to plan for attainment by those datesas a legal impossibility. EPA believes that Congress would have intendedEPA in such circumstances to select, in place of the elapsed dates, a subsequentdate consistent with the general principles of the CAA and Part D. <T3>See Chevron, U.S.A. </T3>v. <T3>N.R.D.C., </T3>467 U.S. 837 (1984). Although it is not clear what subsequent date Congress would have intendedin these circumstances, the history of the CAA's planning requirementssuggests that Congress would have provided EPA (and these areas) an additionalperiod analogous to the 3- and 5-year periods set forth in section 110(a)(2)(A)and section 110(e), respectively. When Congress in 1977 directed EPA toinitiate a new round of planning for areas that had failed earlier to produceadequate plans meeting the section 110 requirements, it created new planningperiods comparable to the section 110 periods (3/5 years from EPA's approvalof the state plan), rather than shortening those periods and thereby demandingplans for immediate attainment. Section 172(a)(1) required the SIPs fornonextension areas to provide for attainment by the end of 1982, four yearsfrom the date these submittals were due (January 1, 1979) (<T3>see </T3>section 129(c)). Congress provided a much longer attainmentperiod for extension areas_from January 1, 1979 to December 31, 1987, approximatelynine years from the date the initial Part D SIPs were due. But it set uptwo planning periods for these areas_one to apply all ``reasonably available''measures and a second to supplement those measures. Since most reasonablyavailable measures should already have been implemented in the Maricopaarea by now, EPA regards post-1987 planning for the area as comparableto the planning during the second Part D period. That period spanned fromthe July 1982 submittal date (<T3>see </T3>section 129(c)) to the end of 1987, a period roughly consistentwith the 3- and 5-year periods in section 110. Thus, although sections110(a)(2) and (e) do not literally apply to the Maricopa area, EPA willuse them as the best indicators of the attainment periods Congress wouldhave intended to apply to these areas after passage of the Part D dates.\2\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ EPA has historically concluded that the Administratormay grant himself a 2-year attainment date extension request under section110(e) if necessary when he promulgates a FIP provided that all of therequirements of that section have been met. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>38 FR 30626 (November 6, 1973). <T3>See also City of Santa Rosa </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>534 f.2D 150, 153 (9th Cir. 1976) (``The Administrator ispermitted to provide a two-year extension of the deadline'' in promulgatinga FIP). Section 110(a)(2) requires the plan to provide for attainment as expeditiouslyas practicable but no later than 3 years from EPA's approval of an adequateplan, which in the context of section 110(c) must mean 3 years from thedate EPA promulgates the FIP. Section 110(e) allows the EPA Administratorto grant a 2-year extension of the attainment date (beyond the 3-year periodin section 110(a)(2)(A)) only if:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) One or more emissions sources (or classes of moving sources) areunable to comply with the requirements of such plans which implement suchprimary standard because the necessary technology or other alternativesare not available or will not be available soon enough to permit compliancewithin such 3-year period, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) The State has considered and applied as a part of its plan reasonablyavailable alternative means of attaining such primary standard and hasjustifiably concluded that attainment of such primary standard within the3 years cannot be achieved.</ITAG>It is not readily apparent from the language of subparagraph (A) whetheran area becomes eligible for this extension only if the means to attainwithin 3 years are not available in a technological rather than a cost-relatedsense. It is doubtful, however, that Congress intended to preclude EPAfrom considering the economic feasibility or reasonableness of the availablemeans of attainment in making this judgment. If Congress had intended todo so, no area would be eligible for the extension, since all areas canattain the standard within 3 years simply by shutting down all economicactivity. Since Congress clearly intended that some areas be provided theextension, EPA is inclined to interpret subparagraph (A) to require onlya showing that the implementation of the ``reasonably available alternativemeans'' (RAAM) described in subparagraph (B) would not bring about attainmentwithin 3 years. Subparagraph (B), then, would provide assurance that thosereasonably available means are indeed implemented to achieve interim progresswithin the 3-year period. Therefore, an area would be eligible for the2-year extension if the plan demonstrates that the area is actually implementingthe RAAM within the 3-year period and that it still cannot attain withinthat 3-year period. Applying these attainment deadlines to the Maricopa area, the plan mustdemonstrate attainment as expeditiously as practicable but in no case laterthan 1991 (assuming plan approval or promulgation in 1988), unless evenwith the application of reasonably available alternative means attainmentcannot be achieved within that period. For the reasons described belowand later in this notice, EPA proposes to supplement the State's plan forthe Maricopa area with two measures suggested by the State's plan_an employer-basedtrip reduction program and an oxygenated fuels program_that will bringabout attainment of the CO standard by 1991 in the area. EPA believes that both a trip reduction program and an oxygenated fuelsprogram are technologically available measures that would produce enoughemissions reductions in combination to bring about attainment by 1991.However, EPA does not believe that any combination of available, practicablemeasures exists which could provide for attainment in the Maricopa areabefore 1991. It is true that a very stringent oxygenated fuels programcould theoretically advance the attainment date to 1990, but EPA cannotnow conclude that any oxygenated fuels program is definitely practicablefor application in the Maricopa area due to numerous outstanding questionsconcerning market penetration, fuel availability, compliance monitoring,and consumer reaction to such a program. EPA is proposing the oxygenatedfuels program described later only because it is necessary to provide forattainment by 1991. Whether or not a trip reduction program would be practicablefor Maricopa, the emission reduction attributed to such a program alonewould not be sufficient to advance the attainment date for the area. Further,as explained in EPA's ANPRM, EPA rejected all other measures for inclusionin the FIP either because EPA lacked authority to implement them, theywere impracticable due to major economic and social impacts, or it wouldbe impracticable for EPA to implement them at the federal level given similarexisting state programs. <T3>See </T3>(52 FR 45466, 45468 (col. 1)). Consequently, EPA does notbelieve that any practicable measures exist which could achieve attainmentin the Maricopa area before 1991. On the other hand, EPA can also not make the conclusion, necessary to supporta two-year attainment date extension under section 110(e), that a tripreduction program and an oxygenated fuels program are clearly not reasonablyavailable alternative measures. Oxygenated fuels are technologically availableand EPA believes that, although they are numerous and significant, theoutstanding questions concerning the program may well prove not to be significantobstacles to successful implementation of the program. Similarly, a tripreduction program is in place in some California localities and thus, despiteemployer resistance, it is possible that such a program will prove reasonablyavailable for the Phoenix area as well. Therefore, EPA is proposing a trip reduction ordinance and an oxygenatedfuels program for the Maricopa area because both programs are technologicallyavailable measures to provide the emission reductions that are necessaryto bring the  area into attainment by 1991. And, beyond that, EPA proposesnot to invoke the two-year extension provided in section 110(e). In preparing the FIP for Maricopa, EPA will comply with outstanding agencyguidance on CO SIP preparation. In an April 4, 1979 notice (44 FR 20372),EPA published criteria for approval of the Part D SIP revisions that theAct required states to submit in 1979. On January 22, 1981 (46 FR 7182),EPA published criteria for evaluating the supplemental SIP revisions forextension areas due in mid-1982. Section 110(a)(2) requires a plan to provide not only for timely attainmentof the NAAQS but also for maintenance of the standards thereafter. EPA'sFIP for the Maricopa area is based on the modeling and emission projectionsprepared by MAG as part of its SIP submittal. The MAG Plan projects emissionsonly through 1995; however, the projections demonstrate that the proposedFIP will continue maintenance of the CO NAAQS at least through l995. EPA'sproposed policy on post-1987 planning would require post-1987 SIPs to includea demonstration of maintenance for a period of ten years following thetime of SIP submittal. If this proposed policy were applied to the MaricopaFIP, it would require a maintenance demonstration through 1998. EPA's roughprojections indicate that with the FIP proposed today the Maricopa areawould attain and maintain the CO NAAQS through 1998 despite the phase outof the CO reduction benefits of the Federal Motor Vehicle Emission ControlProgram and the continued growth and associated increases in vehicle miles traveled in the Maricopa area. EPA will continue to gather the necessarydata to determine whether this initial projection is valid. In the meantime,EPA solicits comment on whether it should apply the maintenance requirementsof the proposed post-1987 policy to the Maricopa FIP. If EPA concludesthat the FIP should demonstrate maintenance through 1998, and the finaldata analysis indicate that the standard will not be maintained throughthat period with the measures in the proposed FIP, EPA will supplementthe FIP with additional measures sufficient to demonstrate continued maintenanceof the CO standard through at least 1998. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. SIP Evaluation </ITAG>A. Description of the Modeling Analysis The Maricopa Plan used the Urban Airshed Model (UAM) to evaluate regionalcarbon monoxide levels and CALINE4/V9-PG to evaluate hotspot CO levels.UAM requires both spacial and temporal disaggregation of the emission inventory.In Maricopa County in 1985, 88.5 percent of the carbon monoxide emittedwas from on-road motor vehicles. The balance of the inventory was frommilitary and civilian aircraft operations (6.5 percent), industrial sources,fires, and miscellaneous sources (a total of 5 percent). Stationary sourceemissions were gridded based on the known locations of the sources (civilianairports and Air Force bases) or were allocated by population. Mobile source emissions were gridded in a multi-step process which firstrequired traffic modeling and then integration of the traffic modelingresults with emission factors from EPA's MOBILE3 model. Traffic modelingwas performed by MAG's Transportation Planning Office (MAGTPO) using theUrban Transportation Planning System (UTPS) model. UTPS allocates regionaltraffic to links in the transportation network based on residential andemployment patterns. Vehicle fleet emission factors were developed withMOBILE3 using local vehicle registration data, mileage accumulation ratesby age of vehicle, the Arizona inspection and maintenance (I/M) programcharacteristics, and local tampering and misfueling rates. The mobile sourceinventory was gridded by integrating traffic volumes for each link fromUTPS with the speed- and temperature-adjusted emission factor from MOBILE3.Intrinsic in the mobile source emission inventory are the impacts of theFederal Motor Vehicle Control program (FMVCP), improvements to the ArizonaI/M program passed by the State Legislature before 1987, and roadway improvementsincluding the construction of the MAG Regional Freeway/Expressway Plan.Both the UAM and CALINE4/V9-PG air quality modeling was performed by SystemsApplications, Inc. (SAI) under contract to MAG. The modeling simulatedthe Phoenix atmospheric conditions from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. on October25 to 26, 1985. The results were validated against the measured ambientCO levels. The maximum modeled 8-hour CO concentration was 18.5 ppm, whichoccurred between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. The modeling resultsindicate that in the area of the predicted highest 8-hour ambient CO concentrations,the ambient levels are caused by a gradual build-up of CO throughout theurban area rather than by accounted for 15 percent or less of the totalmodeled ambient CO levels. The relative contributions do not change significantlyin the future years modeled. After SAI completed its work, the State of Arizona's Department of EnvironmentalQuality (ADEQ) with MAG concurrence made three adjustments to the modelingresults. All three of these corrections increased the emission reductionsneeded for attainment in the three future years modeled: 1987, 1990, and1995. During the modeling effort, new population forecasts were adopted by theMAG Regional Council. Because the number of vehicle trips and vehicle milestraveled (VMT) in an area are directly related to population, the new populationforecasts, which are substantially higher than previous forecasts, indicatedthat the VMT figures used in the SAI modeling were too low and thus thefuture ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide predicted in the modelingwere also too low. The State corrected the modeling to account for thenew VMT projections developed by MAGTPO from the new population figures.MOBILE3 predicts substantial conversion of the light-duty vehicle fleetto diesel; however, the predicted rates of diesel conversion are not beingseen in the Maricopa County vehicle registration data. Because diesel vehiclesemit much lower levels of CO than equivalent gasoline-powered vehicles,using the higher fleet penetration of diesels that MOBILE3 predicts, wouldunderestimate the Maricopa fleet emissions. The State thus corrected themodeling to reflect the lower number of diesel vehicles. The final adjustment that the State made to the modeling was to freezethe I/M benefits for any vehicle that had been in the program for fiveyears. ADEQ believes that the Arizona program provides lower and lowerbenefits in each consecutive year that a vehicle is inspected. The Statemodeled this effect by freezing the I/M benefits for any vehicle afterfive years of inspections. MOBILE3, however, continues to assign benefitsin each year that a vehicle is in an I/M program. Based on the original modeling and the three adjustments discussed above,the State estimated that the reduction in baseline CO emissions that wereneeded for attainment by the end of 1987 was 34.0 percent. The State alsoestimated that emission reductions of 31.2 percent are needed to attainby the end of 1990 and 18.5 percent by the end of 1995. A straight-lineinterpolation of the 1990 and 1995 estimates gives a 1991 reduction targetof 28.6 percent. B. EPA Evaluation of the Modeling Analysis EPA reviewed the dispersion modeling conducted by SAI and finds that theappropriate models and techniques were used for the analysis. EPA agreeswith the State's assessment that high ambient CO levels in Phoenix aredue to a gradual build-up of CO throughout the urban area, with a minimalimpact from hot spot sources. Because of the areawide nature of the COproblem, the post-modeling adjustments should not introduce any significanterror into the emission reduction estimates. EPA recognizes, however, thatmore accurate emission inventories, if used in the base case simulationsand validations, would yield a more accurate forecast of the necessaryfuture-year emission reductions. If future SIP updates are submitted, themost current emission inventories, VMT estimates, meteorological data andair quality data should be used for the modeling inputs and validations.EPA also reviewed the three adjustments to the modeling made by the State.Because the new population forecasts were substantially higher than theones used in the model, the State was correct to adjust the modeling toreflect the new figures. EPA is aware of the over-prediction in MOBILE3of the diesel fraction and will be correcting the problem in the next updateof the mobile source emissions model. Therefore, EPA concurs with thiscorrection to the modeling results. The third adjustment the State made_tofreeze the I/M benefits for each vehicle after five years_is inconsistentwith the accepted use of MOBILE3. The State was unable to provide EPA withdata showing that such an effect occurs in either the Arizona I/M programor other I/M programs in the country. EPA, therefore, believes that thisadjustment is incorrect and has recalculated the emission reductions neededfor attainment excluding it. Although the State is free to base its planningon the higher emission reduction targets derived from its assumption onI/M benefits (<T3>see </T3>CAA section 116), EPA does not believe that it can base itsFIP on the State's I/M assumptions. EPA estimates, based on the information in the MAG CO Plan and its analysisof the modeling adjustments, that a CO emission reduction of 34.0 percentwas needed for attainment by the end of 1987. Emission reduction of 25.6percent is needed for attainment in 1990, 22.0 percent in 1991, and 7.8percent in 1995. C. Evaluation of Control Measures in the SIP The Maricopa Association of Governments recommended a list of forty-fivetransportation and mobile source control measures for inclusion in itsfinal Carbon Monoxide Plan. These measures include expansion of the I/Mprogram boundaries, improvements to transit and ridesharing programs, tripreduction ordinances, public awareness programs, a voluntary no-drive-dayprogram, parking management, high occupancy vehicle (HOV) facilities, trafficflow improvements, pedestrian and bicycle travel amenities, alternativefuels, alternative work hours, changes in land use policies, winter daylightsavings time, and miscellaneous other measures. A complete list of thesemeasures can be found in the technical support document. Modeling of thisrecommended control package showed that, if it were fully implemented,the Maricopa area could attain the CO standard before 1990. The MAG member jurisdictions passed resolutions adopting the Plan and describingtheir specific commitments to the measures listed in it. These resolutionsare included in the submitted SIP. Resolutions or letters of commitmentsare also included in the SIP from the MAG Regional Council, the PhoenixMetropolitan Chamber of Commerce, the Regional Public Transportation Authority(RPTA), the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), and the two localair force bases. Not every jurisdiction or agency committed to every measurerecommended by MAG. For many measures, they lacked legal authority to adoptor implement or were not the primary lead agency. Several measures includingfleetwide use of alternative fuels, I/M program improvements, and winterdaylight savings time require legislative authority to implement. From the review of the specific commitments in the plan as well as actionsof the State Legislature, EPA is crediting as part of the Maricopa SIPthe measures listed in Table 1. The measures are described more specificallyin Chapter V of the MAG plan. EPA estimates that the total emission reductionsfrom this package of approved measures is 3.9 percent in 1990 and 1991and 4.3 percent in 1995. The total emission reductions are not the sumof the reduction achieved by the individual measures because measures thatcontrol tailpipe emissions (e.g. the I/M program) reduce the impact ofmeasures which control VMT (e.g. ridesharing). <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._Emission Reductions Credits in the MAG CO SIP <H1>Measure </H1><H1>1990 </H1><H1>1991 </H1><H1>1995</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">I/M Program_1987 Legislation <D>2.1% </D><D>2.1% </D><D>1.8% </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Short-Range Transit Improvements <D>0.1 </D><D>0.1 </D><D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Expanded MAG Regional Ridesharing Program <D>0.3 </D><D>0.3 </D><D>0.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes on Freeways <D>N/A </D><D>N/A </D><D>0.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Freeway Surveillance, Ramp Metering, and Signage <D>N/A </D><D>N/A </D><D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Increased Bicycle Use <D>0.2 </D><D>0.2 </D><D>0.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pedestrian Travel <D>0.1 </D><D>0.1 </D><D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Conversion of Buses to Alternative Fuels and Use of Electric Busesfor Shuttle Service <D>0.1 </D><D>0.1 </D><D>0.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative Work Hours <D>1.1 </D><D>1.1 </D><D>1.0</D></ITAG></ITAG>  The cities, towns, and the County of Maricopa also made commitments toother measures (for example: Traffic flow improvements, educational programs,and city/county employee programs) that will contribute to reductions inambient carbon monoxide concentrations. Unfortunately, due to the natureof many of these measures and their often very small emission reductions,specific emission reduction estimates were impossible to calculate. MAG claimed credit in its Plan for two additional measures that EPA isnot proposing to approve in this notice. The first measure is conversionof state, local, and corporate fleets to alternative fuels. EPA is notcrediting this measure because, later in this notice, EPA is proposinga regional alternative fuels program that will automatically cover thesevehicle fleets. Giving individual credit to the MAG measure would resultin a double counting of emission reductions. MAG also claimed substantial credit for a voluntary no drive day program.EPA compliments the Maricopa region on its efforts to establish a program;however, the Agency's review of this measure found several issues thatshould be resolved before EPA will consider approving the measure as partof the SIP. The first issue is assurance of annual funding, as required by CAA section172(b)(7), adequate to support the effort needed to achieve continuingemission reductions. The second issue is the development of an institutionalstructure meeting the requirements of section 172(b)(10) that the State,the general purpose local governments, or a regional agency designatedby the general purpose local governments have legal responsibility forimplementing the measure. The last issue is the development of a monitoringprogram to assess and verify the impact of the program. In addition to these issues, EPA is unsure of what emission reduction creditto give the program. The MAG plan claims a credit of 11 percent in 1990and 12.5% in 1995 for the measure; however, based upon EPA's review ofthe program this credit is clearly too high. MAG has not proposed any alternativelevel of credit. While the program was operated during the winter of 1987/88,EPA has not yet received documentation of the results. EPA would wish toreview these results before determining a specific emission reduction credit.EPA stated its concerns about the voluntary no-drive-day program in a letterto the Maricopa Association of Governments on April 7, 1988. The letteris part of the docket for this notice. Several other control measures are currently under consideration or studyfor inclusion in the Maricopa SIP. These measures are further improvementsto the inspection and maintenance program, a trip reduction ordinance,an alternative fuels program, and winter daylight saving time. These measuresand their potential impact on the proposed FIP are discussed in greaterdetail later in this notice. EPA's 1981 policy establishing criteria for approval of 1982 Plan revisions(46 FR 7182 (January 22, 1981)) required SIPs to include procedures tocomply with requirements under section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act to assurethat federally funded or approved projects conform to the SIP. Althoughthe Maricopa plan does include procedures that can be used for conformityreview, the TSD describes additional criteria that the State should addto its program to fully comply with EPA's 1981 guidance. EPA's proposedpolicy on post-1987 attainment planning (52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987))proposed additional conformity requirements. EPA will work with MaricopaCounty to incorporate procedures and criteria incorporating EPA's guidanceof 1980, 1981, and the post-1987 proposal concerning conformity procedures.D. Demonstration of Attainment in the MAG Plan EPA's analysis of the Maricopa CO Plan finds that a reduction of 22.0 percentin the 1991 baseline emission inventory is necessary to demonstrate attainmentby December 31, 1991. The State submitted approvable control measures thatwill achieve only a 3.9 percent reduction in carbon monoxide emissionsby the end of 1991, leaving a shortfall of 18.1 percent. Therefore, EPAfinds that the State's plan neither demonstrates attainment within thenecessary timeframe nor maintenance thereafter. E. New Source Review (NSR) Arizona has not submitted all of the revisions to its NSR rules necessaryto cure the deficiencies that EPA identified in its July 3, 1983 noticeproposing approval of the Maricopa NSR rules. EPA has reviewed the deficienciesand has determined that the NSR rules in their current form meet federalcurrent requirements when supplemented by commitments from the ADEQ andMCBAQC to issue permits in compliance with specific provisions of existingfederal NSR regulations and policies. The Maricopa County Bureau of AirQuality Control (MCBAQC) submitted its commitment letter to the EPA onApril 28, 1988. A copy of the letter is included in EPA's technical supportdocument for this notice. The ADEQ commitment is expected in the near future.Thus, with these commitments, EPA intends to take final action to approvethe Maricopa NSR program when EPA takes final action on today's proposal.F. Public Participation Based on MAG's public participation program, EPA finds that the State fulfilledthe federal public participation requirements. The program utilized fourmajor planning groups: The MAG Air Quality Policy Committee; MAG Air QualityPlanning Group; MAG Management Committee and MAG Regional Council. Technicalsupport for the program was provided by MAG, ADEQ, ADOT and Maricopa CountyHealth Department. Together, these groups are composed of elected officials,citizen representatives, and regional traffic and planning experts. To gather input on the MAG plan, these groups held numerous meetings, providedbriefings to local councils, held public hearings and conducted an airquality survey to determine public perceptions regarding air quality. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Proposed Federal Implementation Plan </ITAG>A. Reductions Needed from a Federal Plan for 1991 Attainment The State of Arizona submitted the <T3>1987 MAG Carbon Monoxide Plan for the Maricopa County Area </T3>toEPA as a revision to the Maricopa County portion of the Arizona State ImplementationPlan (SIP). As described above, EPA's evaluation of the air quality modelinganalysis in the SIP submittal shows that a 22.0 percent reduction in the1991 baseline carbon monoxide emissions is needed to demonstrate attainmentof the 8-hour CO standard by December 31, 1991. The Plan, however, providesan approvable emission reduction of only 3.9 percent by the end of 1991,leaving a shortfall of 18.1 percent in the emission reductions needed forattainment. To fill this shortfall, EPA is proposing two federal control measures forMaricopa County. These measures are an Employer Alternative Modes IncentivesProgram and an Oxygenated Fuels Program. The measures in the Arizona SIPsubmittal that are being proposed for approval together with the two proposedfederal measures will provide a 22.0 percent reduction in carbon monoxideemissions by the end of 1991 and are thus sufficient to demonstrate attainmentof the 8-hour carbon monoxide standard in Maricopa County. The proposed federal measures are discussed in detail in the followingsections. In this notice, EPA is soliciting comments on all parts of itsproposed control measures. It is also requesting comment on the overallcontrol strategy and specifically on whether the proposed trip reductionregulation should be replaced by a higher average oxygen-content levelin the oxygenated fuels program. Trip Reduction Regulation versus Higher Oxygen Content Fuels EPA recognizes the relatively low emission impact of the proposed tripreduction regulation: Approximately 1.8% of a total 22% reduction in COemissions necessary by 1991. Trip reduction regulations are also fairlynew concepts in controlling air pollution and there is little actual dataon implementation and emission reductions. However, locally adopted tripreduction ordinances (TROs) have been successful as traffic congestionand energy conservation measures in many areas of the country. Accordingly,EPA is continuing to examine the usefulness of a trip reduction regulationas an alternative to an even higher oxygen-content fuel. The cost of implementing the proposed regulation is a major concern. Limitedstudies on the range of cost to employers to implement a trip reductionprogram range from $10,000 for a modest program to cover $100,000 for anextensive program run by a large employer (over 1,000 employees). The totalcosts for Maricopa County employers of the proposed regulation range from$9.5 to $65.8 million. Another concern about the proposed trip reduction regulation in MaricopaCounty is the potential controversies that may occur when over 700 employers,located in 22 jurisdictions, attempt to implement a federally mandatedrule. In addition, some local government representatives have expressedstrong concern over the timing of the TROs for the Maricopa area. Theyargue that the sales tax initiative for public transit should be decidedin early 1989 before adopting TROs. In addition, they argue that it wouldbe a more cost-effective approach to have a higher oxygen content fuelbecause it would be a less disruptive method of achieving higher emissionreduction sooner. Another concern raised in the comments to the ANPRM published by EPA onNovember 30, 1987, was the impact that a trip reduction regulation mighthave on citizen's ability to travel to and from work and the potentialfor added cost that an alternative mode of transit might incur. Because of these numerous concerns over mandating a TRO, and the impactsof a higher average oxygen content fuel program as discussed elsewhere,EPA is especially soliciting comments on the usefulness of mandating atrip reduction regulation in this FIP. EPA is open to both options at thistime. Upon review of comments on all parts of this proposal, we will makethe final decision on whether to promulgate a federal trip reduction regulation.B. EPA Proposed Control Measures <ITAG tagnum="81">1. The Employer Alternative Modes Incentives Program </ITAG>Trip ReductionOrdinances in the Maricopa CO Plan Of the forty-five control measures in its 1987 Carbon Monoxide Plan, theMaricopa Association of Governments recommended six for high priority.These six were an expansion to statewide of the vehicle inspection andmaintenance program, a feasibility study on the use of alternative fuels,a voluntary no drive day program, long range transit improvements, a switchto winter daylight savings time, and the development of a model trip reductionordinance. In its resolution to adopt the Plan, MAG committed to ``preparea Model Trip Reduction Ordinance and Coordinated Parking Management Programfor consideration for adoption by the MAG cities, towns, and Maricopa County.''\3\<NOTE/> In addition, a majority of the MAG jurisdictions committedto participate with MAG in the development of the model ordinance and/orconsider the model ordinance once developed for adoption. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ ``Resolution to Adopt the MAG 1987 Carbon Monoxide Planand the MAG 1987 Ozone Plan for the Maricopa County Area,'' the MaricopaAssociation of Governments, July 10, 1987. MAG contracted with K.T. Analytics, Inc. (Frederick, Maryland) to developthe model trip reduction ordinance (TRO) and coordinated parking managementprogram. MAG also appointed a working group to review the contractor'sproducts, to provide information to the contractor, and to monitor theprogress of the project. The group was also to solicit input from the privatedevelopment community. This working group consisted of twenty members representingMaricopa jurisdictions, several State agencies, the Regional Public TransportationAuthority, the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce, private businesses, and communitygroups. EPA participated informally in the working group. The working group met regularly with the consultant from late September,1987, to February, 1988, to review and comment on the model ordinance asit was being drafted. During this period, the working group also held apublic hearing on the draft model and four forums with local Chambers ofCommerce to inform their members about the ordinance and to receive comments.On February 5, 1988, the working group made several changes to the draftmodel TRO and then voted unanimously to forward it to the MAG Air QualityPolicy Committee. On February 18, 1988, the MAG Air Quality Policy Committee reviewed thedraft model ordinance and voted to continue consideration of the modelat its March meeting. On March 10, the Air Quality Policy Committee, basedon public comment that it had received and its own consideration of theordinance, voted to recommend to the MAG Regional Council that furtherconsideration of the model trip reduction ordinance be postponed untilafter the transit funding election tentatively scheduled for the springof 1989. On March 23, the Regional Council accepted the Policy Committee'srecommendation and tabled approval of the model ordinance for effectivelyone year. Request by MAG for an Extended Deadline for Adoption of the TRO On January 27, 1988, EPA stated to the Regional Council that EPA expectedadoption of trip reduction ordinances by the Maricopa jurisdictions byMay 31, 1988. EPA also stated that if the jurisdictions needed more timeto adopt the ordinances, EPA would consider extending the deadline. OnMarch 31, 1988, MAG sent a letter to EPA which described the actions ofthe MAG Regional Council to table the ordinance, gave the rationale forthe action, and requested that EPA extend the May 31, 1988 deadline untilafter a transit funding election set for an indefinite date in 1989. Pleasesee the Technical Support Document concerning EPA's response to MAG's request.The question of a new deadline for the adoption of a TRO is made moot bythe publication of today's FIP proposal. Since EPA is under court orderto promulgate a FIP at this time, it cannot delay into next year for thelocal jurisdictions to adopt trip reduction ordinances. The MAG Model Trip Reduction Ordinance The draft model trip reduction ordinance developed for MAG requires allemployers with 100 or more employees at a worksite to implement trip reductionprograms to reduce commute trips by their employees. The goal of the employerprograms are to reduce single-occupant-vehicle (SOV) trips to the worksiteby 5 percent in the first year of operation and by an additional 5 percentin the second year. The model also requires employers of 100 or more ina jurisdiction, but not necessarily all at a single worksite, to provideinformation to their employees annually on alternative commute modes. Underthe model, new developments may receive a reduction in normal parking requirementsby taking actions which support trip reduction strategies, such as operatingshuttle buses or installing showers, lockers, or bicycle storage lockers.An employer with 100 or more employees at a worksite is required by themodel to disseminate information on alternative modes (trip reduction promotionprogram), to appoint a transportation coordinator, to perform annual employeesurveys, and to prepare and submit an annual trip reduction report andplan. The transportation coordinator can be either an employee of the employeror a contract service. The employee surveys require information on thenumber of employees at the worksite, the commute modes of the employees,and other information which the jurisdiction will use to assess the impactof the TRO. The annual trip reduction report and plan is to describe thetrip reduction activities of the employer in the previous year and to outlinethe trip reduction goal and strategies for the forthcoming year. The schedule on which employers become subject to the requirements of theordinance is based on the number of employees at a worksite. Employerswith 500 or more employees at a worksite become subject six months afterthe effective date of the ordinance. Employers of 200 to 499 employeesat a worksite become subject ten months after the effective date, and employersof 100 to 199 employees at a worksite become subject eighteen months afterthe effective date. The effective date of the ordinance is thirty daysafter its adoption. Employers are required to appoint a transportationcoordinator and initiate the trip reduction promotion program within twomonths of the date that they become subject to the ordinance. All affectedemployers have the same due date for the employee survey and the annualtrip reduction report and plan. Exact due dates are not specified in themodel but are left to the individual jurisdictions to select. The model ordinance requires the jurisdiction to appoint a jurisdictionaltransportation coordinator to oversee implementation of the ordinance.The model also establishes an advisory committee in each jurisdiction.Membership of this advisory committee may include representatives of thejurisdiction, employers in the jurisdiction, regional transit and rideshareprograms, civic or public interest groups, and the jurisdiction's transportationcoordinator. The duties of the committee are to recommend to the jurisdictionguidelines for implementation of and compliance with the ordinance, newtrip reduction goals as appropriate, and enforcement actions and to preparean annual report to the governing body on the TRO. In addition, the jurisdictiontransportation coordinator is to coordinate with other jurisdictions andregional agencies. The Maricopa Association of Governments is to recommendregional trip reduction goals annually for consideration by its local jurisdictions.Violations of the ordinance are failures to conduct or provide the resultsof the annual survey to the jurisdiction, to prepare or provide the annualtrip reduction plan and report, to designate a transportation coordinator,or to implement the trip reduction plan or the promotion program in ``goodfaith and with reasonable efforts.'' Failure to meet the annual trip reductiongoal is not considered to be a violation of the ordinance. Violations arepunishable by fines of up to $300 per day or by a civil injunction fromviolating the provisions of the ordinance. In its Plan, MAG modeled a hypothetical TRO which required a 10 percentreduction in <T3>vehicle </T3>trips to single employer worksites with 100 or more employees.This modeling showed that such a TRO would reduce carbon monoxide emissionsby 2.8 percent in 1990, 2.8 percent in 1991, and 2.7 percent in 1995. Themodel TRO developed for MAG differed from the hypothetical one in thatits goal is a 10 percent reduction in <T3>single-occupant-vehicle </T3>(SOV) trips. These goals are not the samebecause there is not always a one-to-one correspondence between a SOV tripreduction and a vehicle trip reduction. For example, if two employees whoformerly drove to work alone now carpool together, two single-occupant-vehicletrips have been eliminated; however, because one vehicle is still beingdriven to the worksite, only one vehicle trip has been eliminated. Themodeling also assumed adoption of a TRO by all jurisdictions in the nonattainmentarea. To determine the appropriate emission reduction for the MAG model ordinance,EPA estimated that the new commute mode of one-half of the SOV trip reductionsfrom the model ordinance would be two-person carpools and one-half wouldbe the third or greater person in a car or vanpool or a transit, bicycleor pedestrian trip. Based on these estimates, EPA calculated the actualtrip reduction from the model ordinance to be 7.5 percent and the emissionreduction from the ordinance to be 1.8 percent in 1991 (7.5% compared tothe 10% trip reduction from the hypothetical TRO). The emission reductionof 1.8 percent is not 75 percent of the 2.8 percent modeled by MAG becausefactors such as the decrease in vehicle miles traveled and congestion reliefas well as the decrease in trips influence the emission reduction froma TRO. Recently, an amendment to Arizona Senate Bill 1181 was introduced intothe Arizona House of Representatives. This amendment is a trip reductionstatute modeled closely on the ordinance adopted by five jurisdictionsin Pima County. The amended S.B. 1181 would require Maricopa County, throughan appointed board, to implement and enforce the statute for all partsof the Maricopa carbon monoxide nonattainment area. Starting in January,1989, employers with more than 100 employees at a worksite would be requiredto implement trip reduction strategies sufficient to have 15 percent ofall their employees using alternative modes in the first year and 20 percentin the second year. New trip reduction goals would be set annually afterthe second year. If an employer failed to meet his trip reduction goal,he would be required to implement a specific number of trip reduction strategies.Because of the difference in how the trip reduction goals are measuredbetween this bill and the hypothetical TRO modeled in the MAG Plan, EPAis not able at this time to estimate the potential emission reductionsin Maricopa County from the amendment. Informally, EPA has been informedby MAG that this proposed amendment would achieve approximately the sameemission reduction as the model TRO. EPA requests that the State analyzethe emission reduction benefits of the measure. Selection of Trip Reduction Regulation for the FIP The Maricopa region is one of the fastest growing areas in the United States,adding approximately 4 percent to its population each year. Because ofthe region's large area, low density development patterns, and inadequatetransit, the population is highly dependent on the private automobile formobility. Thus, the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) has grown ata faster rate than population. In such situations, growth in VMT can beginto offset the emission reductions from cleaner motor vehicles. When consideringmeasures for the FIP, EPA reviewed both the projected VMT growth ratesin Maricopa County and the measures to reduce VMT in the MAG SIP and determinedthat additional measures to control the rate of growth in VMT needed tobe considered for the federal plan. While home-to-work and work-to-home commute trips are often not the majorityof trips taken in an area, they are the most routine of all trip types.The majority of workers commute to and from work each day at the same timefollowing the same route. This routineness facilitates the substitutionof alternative commute modes for drive-alone commutes. In addition, commutetrips traditionally have had the lowest vehicle occupancy rates. Finally,due to the large number of vehicles on the road, the low speeds, and thecongestion which are common during rush hours, most violations of the carbonmonoxide standard start during the commute hours. For these reasons, programsthat address commute trips would be the most effective at reducing VMTand carbon monoxide emissions and ambient air quality standard violations.There are many ways to encourage conversion of single-occupant commutetrips to alternative modes. Improved ridesharing programs; peak hour localand express transit services; parking price strategies that discourageall day parking or provide discounts for car and vanpools; variable workhours which allow employees to make ridesharing/transit arrangements; facilitiesat the worksite such as showers, lockers, and bicycle parking which encouragewalking and bicycling; and provision of food, banking, postal or otherservices at or near the worksite which eliminate the need for vehiclesat lunch time are just some of the viable programs to reduce trips to theworkplace. However, of these available measures, the more traditional transportationcontrol measures (TCMs)_like transit improvements or construction of flowimprovements, bicycle lanes or pedestrian facilities_would be impracticablefor EPA to finance and beyond the authority of EPA to require local jurisdictionsto finance (see Response to ANPRM Comments in the TSD). In addition, ablanket requirement for many of these strategies without reference to theirapplicability to a particular worksite would waste limited resources andwould not be as effective at reducing trips as more selective applications.Faced with the myriad of methods of reducing commute trips, the potentialcost of implementing traditional TCMs, and the need to tailor trip reductionstrategies to the individual worksites, EPA decided to propose and takecomment on an approach to controlling VMT growth that is becoming increasinglypopular among communities in the West and is given high priority in theMAG CO Plan: Trip reduction ordinances (TROs) which require employers todevelop and implement worksite trip reduction programs. The principle behindTROs is that if an employer enhances alternative commute options and thebenefits to the individual employee of these options, then some employeeswill voluntarily shift out of single-occupant vehicles. However, the individualemployee at all times retains his right to choose his commute mode. TROs have disadvantages as well. Although TROs may be more easily enforcedthan other TCMs, a TRO would add an additional level of federal enforcementthat would not be necessary if a more stringent oxygenated fuels programwere adopted. Further, the TRO would be mandatory for certain employersand the costs for providing the incentives necessary to ensure mode switchingare not certain and may be expensive. Individual employees maintain their option to drive alone to work but areinformed of and offered alternative modes. TROs allow employers to chooseamong the range of trip reduction incentives appropriate to their worksiteand their employees' interest. Because of these incentives, traditionalTCMs such as regional rideshare programs, transit, bicycle and pedestrianamenities are enhanced. A trip reduction regulation has one important additional advantage whichmakes it more appropriate for a federal implementation plan than many traditionalTCMs. This advantage is that the emission reductions from a TRO can bemore easily made enforceable. Regional strategies such as transit and regionalrideshare programs must rely on drivers switching voluntarily to them inorder to decrease trips. While increased services in these types of programsgenerally lead to higher levels of use, this result is neither guaranteednor enforceable. Emission reductions, however, from a trip reduction regulationwhere employers must offer sufficient incentives to their employees toachieve a certain level of trip reduction can be made enforceable. The Proposed Federal Trip Reduction Regulation EPA is proposing for comment today a federal trip reduction regulationsimilar but not identical to the model trip reduction ordinance developedby the Maricopa Association of Governments. The final decision of whetherto promulgate a trip reduction regulation or whether to rely on a morestringent oxygenated fuels program and no trip reduction regulation willbe made after EPA reviews comments received on all parts of this proposal.Like MAG's ordinance, this federal rule, titled the ``Employer AlternativeModes Incentives Program'' (EAMIP), would regulate all employers in theMaricopa County carbon monoxide nonattainment area (which is also the MAGurban planning area) with 100 or more employees at a worksite. The proposedregulation defines all employers with 100 or more employees at a worksiteas ``Major Employers.'' The proposed EAMIP requires a Major Employer todevelop and offer to his employees an alternative modes incentives programthat would reduce single-occupant-vehicle commute trips to his worksite.Before describing the detailed requirements of the proposed federal tripreduction regulation, a discussion of the EPA's proposed method of andphilosophy on implementing the regulation in Maricopa County is appropriate.Primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the EAMIP would liewith the Director of the Air Management Division of EPA's Region 9 Officein San Francisco, California. In implementing this program, EPA would workclosely with all Major Employers in Maricopa County. EPA realizes thatthis would be infeasible if the Agency attempts to implement the regulationfrom its San Francisco office; therefore, EPA at this time proposes tohire a qualified contractor located in Maricopa to implement the EAMIP.A final decision on how to implement will depend on the comments receivedon this proposal. EPA, however, would retain enforcement activities inits Region 9 Office. EPA would fund the selected, Maricopa-based, contractor to provide trainingto employer transportation coordinators, to review and recommend approvaland disapproval of trip reduction plans and annual reports, to processexemption requests, and to implement other provisions of the regulation.A major responsibility of the contractor would be to furnish the MajorEmployer with timely information and assistances on complying with theEAMIP. Currently, it is believed that there are over 700 worksites whichwould be subject to this proposed regulation. EPA estimates that the contractorwould require four full-time employees with additional clerical support.EPA would closely monitor its contractor to insure that the needs of MajorEmployers are being served. EPA would select a qualified contractor in Maricopa County within fourmonths of the date of this regulation's promulgation. It is EPA's hopethat the contractor would be a regional agency in Maricopa County or anArizona State agency. EPA would like to integrate the implementation ofthis regulation into on-going State, regional, and local alternative modeprograms and thereby enhance both the effectiveness of the EAMIP and thelocal programs. For several reasons, EPA would prefer to have trip reduction programs implementedat the local level. First and primarily, local concerns are best addressedfrom that level. While EPA intends to establish an advisory committee madeup of representatives of affected groups in the Maricopa region, this willnot provide EPA with the same knowledge of the area as those who live andwork there. Second, even with a contractor in place in Maricopa, some ofthe implementation and all of the enforcement of the program would stillneed to be conducted from EPA's Region 9 offices in San Francisco. Thisdistance from the Maricopa region makes the communications necessary forsuccessful implementation more difficult than if the program were adoptedby a local government. Finally, EPA believes that to be effective, tripreduction ordinances or regulations must be integrated into other localtrip reduction programs. While EPA would make every attempt to do this,the ability to work with local programs to achieve integration is moredifficult from the federal level. EPA therefore encourages the local jurisdictionsto adopt similar programs. The sections of the proposed Employer Alternative Modes Incentives Programregulation are described in detail below. Prior to implementing this regulationin Maricopa, EPA would hold workshops for all Major Employers, their transportationcoordinators, and other interested parties to discuss the requirementsof this regulation. a. <T3>Notification. </T3>Major Employers who are subject to this regulationwould be required to notify EPA that they are subject within six monthsof its date of promulgation and provide EPA with the company's name, address,a person EPA may contact in the company and that person's telephone number,and the number of employees at the regulated worksite. Employers who becomesubject to the regulation after the first six month period would be requiredto notify EPA within three months of first becoming subject and providethe same information. Notification is intended to give EPA the opportunity to provide informationand assistance to the Major Employer on this regulation and means of complyingwith it well before the Major Employer would be be required to meet anyof its requirements. EPA intends to inform potentially subject employersof the notification requirement through the media, trade publications,the local chambers of commerce, local jurisdictions, and other routes.While failure to notify EPA would be a violation of the regulation, eachOctober would be an amnesty period for Major Employers who did not notifyEPA within the required time periods to do so without penalty. b. <T3>Trained Transportation Coordinators. </T3>All Major employers wouldbe required to appoint a trained transportation coordinator. The trainedtransportation coordinator may be an employee of the Major Employer ora contractor hired to operate the Major Employer's program. Groups of MajorEmployers may choose to jointly employ a single transportation coordinatorwhich can represent the most cost effective approach that significantlydecreases the program cost to individual employers. EPA's purpose in requiringa trained transportation coordinator would be to ensure that there be adesignated person at each Major Employer who is knowledgeable on the provisionsof this regulation and who is responsible for the operation of the MajorEmployer's alternative modes incentives program. The proposed regulation would require that the transportation coordinatorbe trained. Training is intended to ensure that the employer's transportationcoordinator is fully informed on the requirements of the EAMIP and on availabletrip reduction techniques and programs. The training is envisioned as aninitial three- to four hour course and annual or semiannual one- to two-hourrefresher courses offered free or at cost by EPA. It is EPA's intentionto keep transportation coordinators as fully informed as possible on availabletrip reduction techniques and programs so that they may develop alternativemodes incentives programs which both maximize trip reductions and minimizecosts. The coordinator's responsibilities would include disseminating and postingalternative modes information, performing the annual employee survey, preparingthe trip reduction plan and annual report, obtaining management approvalof the plan, setting up the incentives programs necessary to implementthe plan, and providing assistance to employees on alternative modes. EPAwould not expect employers to hire a new person to fill this position.In fact, such a position would best be filled by a current employee whois familiar with the company and its employees. The position would notneed to be filled by a management level employee. A management assistant,personnel representative, or equivalent staff person would be sufficient.EPA estimates that an employer with up to 500 employees would need to staffthe transportation coordinator position for a maximum of one day per weekand in most cases considerably less, especially after the program is upand running, and if a coordinator is shared by a group of employers. Thestaffing required at larger employers would depend on the complexity ofthe trip reduction program. c. <T3>Annual Employee Survey. </T3>Major employers would be required to surveytheir employees annually on their commute modes. The results of this surveywould be used by the Major Employer and EPA to determine if the trip reductiongoal has been met. At least six months prior to the first required survey,EPA would publish guidelines detailing the minimum criteria that surveyswould be required to meet for completeness and coverage. Major Employers should consider the survey an opportunity to learn of theiremployees' alternative mode preferences. This information will enable theMajor Employer to tailor the alternative modes incentives program to theinterests of his employees and thereby reduce the program's cost by eliminatingunwanted incentives. Because the results of the survey would be used to determine whether thetrip reduction goal has been met, EPA may request that a Major Employeruse a neutral, third party to perform the survey. EPA would limit thisrequest for a neutral third party to when it believes that the Major Employer'ssurvey did not accurately reflect the situation at the worksite. At anytime, a Major Employer at his own discretion may use a neutral third partyto perform the employee survey. EPA is specifically requesting comments on the need for and benefits ofthe annual employee survey. d. <T3>Annual Trip Reduction Promotion Program. </T3>In order to inform employeesof the alternatives to the single-occupant-vehicle commute, the EAMIP wouldrequire Major Employers to annually disseminate information on alternativemodes. This information could include bus schedule and route information,ridesharing brochures, information on bicycle routes, etc. The Major Employerwould also be required to post alternative mode information in prominentplaces and provide such information to new employees on hiring. All disseminatedinformation should include information on employer sponsored alternativemodes incentives. EPA would assist the Major Employer in developing orobtaining the necessary information. The purpose of the Employer Alternative Modes Incentives Program wouldbe to have Major Employers support programs that encourage their employeesto voluntarily switch to commute modes other than the single-occupant vehicle.The reason that a promotion program would be required as part of the EAMIPis that an employee's commute pattern becomes a routine. The first stepfor employees to change modes is education on alternatives, how to usethose alternatives, and the positive impact of changing modes. Therefore,Employers should view the promotion program as an integral part of hisalternative modes incentives program, that, if effectively implemented,would achieve trip reduction goals in a least cost manner. e. <T3>The Trip Reduction Plan and Annual Report. </T3>All Major Employerswould be required to submit to EPA annually a trip reduction plan and annualreport. The plan would describe in detail the alternative modes incentivesthat the Major Employer would offer during the coming year. The annualreport would describe the results of the employee survey, the previousyear's alternative modes promotion program and incentives program, andthe results of that incentives program. A representative of the Major Employerwho is authorized to approve the expenditures necessary to carry out thetrip reduction plan and who certifies the accuracy of the annual reportshould sign the document before submitting it to EPA. The trip reduction plan would describe in detail the alternative modesincentives that the Major Employer would offer during the coming year.In order to insure that Major Employers offer sufficient alternative modesincentives to achieve the trip reduction goal, EPA would review the plansand annual reports and would either approve or disapprove them. EPA wouldcommit to work with Major Employers and their transportation coordinatorsto insure that few plans would need to be disapproved. EPA expects that all alternative modes incentives described in an approvedplan would be implemented during the following year. If during the courseof a year, a Major Employer were unable to offer an incentive in the plan,he would be able to request that the plan be modified to remove the incentive.The Major Employer should make the request to EPA in writing as early aspossible but in all cases before the trip reduction plan and annual reportwould be due. The request should explain why the incentive could not beoffered and discuss the impact of withdrawing the incentive on achievingthe trip reduction goal. If possible, the Major Employer should substituteanother incentive for the one being removed. No request to modify the tripreduction plan would be denied if the Major Employer adequately supportedthe reasons why he cannot implement an incentive and showed that the planwould still meet the required trip reduction goal. The annual trip reduction report would be required to be submitted withthe trip reduction plan as a single document. The annual trip reductionreport should describe the trip reduction promotion program; report onthe conduct of the survey; give a current and accurate estimate of theSOV commute trips made to the worksite as determined from the survey; anddescribe the alternative modes incentives program, if any, that was inthe previous years trip reduction plan including any modifications to theplan. The annual report should also describe what incentives were actuallyoffered and used by the employees, state the previous year's trip reductiongoal and whether it was met, and, if the trip reduction goal was not, thereason the Major Employer believes it was not. Despite the lengthy list of required information in the annual report,EPA does not intend this to be a lengthy document. Tables listing the incentivesand their use by employees, charts showing the results of the survey, andshort narrative sections would in many cases suffice. In order to givebetter guidance to Major Employers on these plans and reports, EPA woulddevelop a model trip reduction plan and annual report and distribute itto all transportation coordinators. Once submitted by the Major Employer, EPA would have sixty days to approveor disapprove the trip reduction plan and annual report. Should EPA disapprovethe document, the Major Employer would have thirty days to correct it.When issuing a disapproval, EPA would describe in detail the reasons forthe disapproval and would work closely with the transportation coordinatorto correct the deficiencies. Any employer who disagrees with EPA's disapprovalof his plan and report could appeal the decision following the proceduresdiscussed below under Appeals. f. <T3>Recordkeeping. </T3>In order to adequately carry out its enforcementresponsibilities, EPA may request that the Major Employer provide informationto support any statement in his annual plan and report. Major Employersshould maintain records on the information in the annual plan and reportincluding the results of the survey for at least three years. By maintaininginformation, the Major Employer would be able to support his position shouldEPA question his trip reduction plan and annual report. EPA is aware thatmuch of the information which may be requested would be considered confidentialby the Major Employer. Upon submitting any data to the Agency, the MajorEmployer could, if appropriate, assert a business confidentiality claimcovering all or part of it. g. <T3>Trip Reduction Goal. </T3>The proposed trip reduction goal in the EAMIPis the same as the one proposed in the MAG model: A 5 percent reductionin SOV trips in the first year of a Major Employer's program and an additional5 percent in the second year for a total of a 10 percent reduction in SOVcommute trips within two years. EPA chose to propose the same goals becauseit concurs with the MAG Model TRO working group that the goals are aggressiveyet achievable in light of the transportation system in Maricopa County.Like the MAG model ordinance, EPA's proposed regulation has a procedurefor annually reviewing and revising the goal after the first two years.EPA would first consult with agencies and Major Employers in Maricopa Countyas well as with the Maricopa Region Advisory Committee before revisingany goals. Trip reduction ordinances adopted in other areas vary in the import thatthey place on the trip reduction goal. Some enforce immediately on failureto meet the goal, while some require specific actions on the part of theemployer if the goal is not met, and others only require an updated tripreduction plan for failure to achieve the goal. MAG's Model TRO is in thefinal group. EPA is proposing that if a Major Employer fails to achieve the trip reductiongoals after three consecutive trip reduction plans with the same goal,he may be subject to enforcement actions. EPA is proposing this provisionbecause it believes that this is a method that insures the emission reductionsattributed to this regulation would actually occur. Under the scenariothat EPA is proposing, a Major Employer has three years to determine themix of alternative modes incentives that would encourage his employeesto switch from their single-occupant vehicles. In addition, EPA would beworking with the Major Employers to develop trip reduction plans that wouldachieve the goals so that enforcement actions, based on failure to achievethe goal, would not be needed. Any time that the trip reduction goal changes,the Major Employer would have an additional three years to meet that newgoal. Because this proposed treatment of the trip reduction goal varies fromthe MAG model, EPA is requesting specific comment on the provision allowingenforcement for failure to meet the trip reduction goal and on the penaltiesfor such failures as described below. h. <T3>Violations. </T3>Major Employers would be subject to enforcement actionsunder section 113 of the Clean Air Act if they fail to meet any of therequirements of this proposed regulation. Major Employers would also besubject to enforcement actions if they falsify or misreport informationin the trip reduction plan and annual report, fail to implement any partof an approved trip reduction plan, or fail to meet the trip reductiongoal after three consecutive years at the same goal. It would be EPA'sintent to work with Major Employers to identify problems with complianceand correct them as quickly as possible. While the majority of implementationtasks would be performed by EPA's contractor in Maricopa County, any enforcementactions would be conducted by EPA's Region 9 Office. Section 113(a) of the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to commence an enforcementaction against any person in violation of an applicable implementationplan. As defined in section 110(d) of the Act, the term ``applicable implementationplan'' includes both state implementation plans (SIPs) approved by EPAand federal implementation plans (FIPs) promulgated by EPA under section110(c). Enforcement under section 113 begins with the issuance of a noticeof violation (NOV) whenever, on the basis of available information, EPAfinds that any person is in violation of an applicable implementation plan.If the violation extends beyond the thirtieth day after the issuance ofthe NOV, EPA may issue an administrative order requiring the person tocomply with the requirements of the applicable implementation plan, orEPA may bring a civil action in federal district court for injunctive reliefand/or a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 per day of violation. i. <T3>Exemptions. </T3>Three categories of Major Employers would be allowedto apply for exemptions from the requirements of this regulation. The firstcategory is Major Employers who on the date of promulgation of this regulationalready have in place trip reduction programs which achieve at least a30 percent participation rate of all employees in alternative modes. Thesetrip reduction programs may either be voluntary on the part of the MajorEmployer or a condition of approval for development imposed by a city,town, or the County of Maricopa. To apply for this exemption, the qualifiedMajor Employer would only need to perform an employee survey annually andsubmit the results to EPA when requesting the exemption. The second category of Major Employers who qualify for an exemption isthose that emp1oy 100 or more employees for less than three months of theyear. The final exemption is for employers covered by a city, town, orcounty trip reduction ordinance. In order for a Major Employer to receivethis exemption, EPA would first have to find that the local ordinance isat least as effective as the federal rule at reducing trips to the MajorEmployer's worksite. All Major Employers who would apply for any exemptionwould have to do so in writing and renew the exemption annually. j. <T3>Schedules. </T3>Major Employers who would be subject to the EAMIP onits date of promulgation would have to notify the Agency within six monthsof the date of promulgation. Major Employers who would become subject tothe regulation after the initial six months would have to notify EPA withinthree months of the date that they become subject. Due dates for the requirements of this regulation, except notification,would be determined from the Major Employer's ``Effective Date.'' Effectivedates for a Major Employer would be determined by the number of employeesat his worksite or by the date the Major Employer first becomes subjectto the EAMIP. The effective dates for Major Employers who would be subject on the dateof promulgation would be: For Major Employers of 500 or more at a worksite,nine months after the date of promulgation; for Major Employers of 200to 499 employees at a worksite, twelve months after the date of promulgation;and for Major Employers of 100 to 199 at a worksite, fifteen months afterthe date of promulgation. For Major Employers who would become subject to the regulation after thefirst six months but before June 1, 1989, their effective date would befifteen months after the date of promulgation. For Major Employers whowould become subject after June 1, 1989, their effective date would bethree months after notification. Within two months of a Major Employer's effective date, he should appointhis trained transportation coordinator and inform the EPA of the coordinator'sname, work address and phone number. Within three months of his effectivedate and annually thereafter on the same date, the Major Employer shouldperform his employee survey. Within four months of his effective date andannually thereafter on the same date, the Employer should submit his tripreduction plan and annual report. If a Major Employer wishes to request an exemption, he should apply forit in writing within thirty days of his effective date. In subsequent years,he should apply for the exemption by that same date. EPA is aware that not all Major Employers would be able to meet the schedulesin the EAMIP. Major Employers would be allowed, with good cause, to requestextension of their deadlines. EPA would make every effort to be fair andequitable in granting extensions. If a Major Employer failed to meet adeadline because of an action of EPA, the Major Employer would not be heldresponsible. In order to provide Major Employers with assistance and prompt responsesto submittals and/or requests, EPA would attempt to arrange that aboutthe same number of Major Employers would submit trip reduction plans andannual reports in each month of the year. EPA would do this by assigningrandomly selected Major Employers new effective dates or deadlines formeeting the provisions of this regulation. Any Major Employer given a neweffective date or deadline would be informed by EPA of the new date atleast three months before his original effective date or deadline. Underno circumstances would EPA advance an effective date or deadline. k. <T3>Appeals. </T3>EPA would work with Employers to minimize the need todisapprove trip reduction plans and annual reports or to deny exemptions.Should the EPA disapprove a plan or deny an exemption, a Major Employercould appeal the decision to the Regional Administrator of Region 9. Appealsshould only be made based on reasons or information first provided to andconsidered by the EPA in making its initial decision. Appeals would be required to be made in writing within fifteen days ofthe Major Employer receiving the disapproval or denial. In applying tothe Regional Administrator to reverse a decision, the Major Employer shouldstate the reasons why the decision is in error and should show that allissues raised in the appeal were previously considered by EPA. Within a reasonable time following the appeal, the Regional Administratorwould grant or deny it. The Regional Administrator would grant the appealby either reversing the decision or remanding the decision to the Directorof Region 9's Air Management Division for further review. EPA would moveto process any appeal that it receives as quickly as possible. l. <T3>Maricopa Regional Advisory Committee. </T3>EPA would consider the concernsof Maricopa jurisdictions, their Major Employers and citizens, and theState of Arizona when taking major actions under the EAMIP. Because theAgency cannot claim as much knowledge of the area and its concerns as thosewho live and work there, EPA proposes to establish the Maricopa RegionalAdvisory Committee (MRAC) consistent with the requirements of the FederalAdvisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. Appendix 2. EPA hopes that the State, MAG and its local jurisdictions, and the localchambers of commerce would assist the Director in establishing MRAC byappointing members to it. To achieve a balance among the interested groups,EPA is proposing that the MRAC have eighteen members and that they be appointedas described below. Two members may be appointed by the MAG Regional Council.One of these two members should represent the mid-sized cities of Chandler,Glendale, Mesa, Scottsdale, and Tempe, and the other member should representthe smaller jurisdictions of Maricopa County. Because it has over halfthe total population and workers in the region, the City of Phoenix mayappoint one member. Maricopa County, because it has primary responsibilityfor tracking air quality, may also appoint one member. Two members representingstate agencies, preferably the Department of Environmental Quality andthe Department of Transportation, may be appointed by the Governor. Onemember of the general public who is a citizen of Maricopa County may beappointed by each Chairman of the Transportation Committees of the StateLegislature. The Regional Public Transportation Authority, because of itsexpertise on regional ridesharing and transit issues, may also appointa member. Eight members representing regulated Employers may be selectedby the region's Chambers of Commerce, three by the Phoenix Chamber of Commerceand five by a coalition of the other Chambers. Finally, the Director ofEPA Region 9's Air Management Division shall also be a member. Representativesshould be either elected or appointed officials or staff members of thejurisdictions or agencies. The proposed duties of the MRAC would be to advise the Director on implementingand/or revising the regulation when appropriate, on revising the Trip ReductionGoals after June 1991, on alternative enforcement procedures, and on othermatters as appropriate. The Committee would also provide the Director withliaison on the EAMIP with the State government and the jurisdictions, citizens,and employers of Maricopa County. EPA proposes that the Committee holdbimonthly public meetings in Maricopa County. m. <T3>Delegation. </T3>The Administrator of the Environmental ProtectionAgency has the authority to delegate implementation and enforcement ofthis regulation to the State, to a regional agency in Maricopa County,or to a local government or the County of Maricopa within its jurisdictionalboundaries. Prior to any delegation, the Administrator would have to determinethat the agency or jurisdiction requesting the delegation has legal authorityto implement and enforce the regulation and has committed the necessarystaffing and resources to implement and enforce it. EPA would encourageagencies who meet these criteria to apply for delegation of this regulation.n. <T3>Implementation Guidelines. </T3>Well before any Major Employer's effectivedate, EPA would publish additional guidelines for compliance as an appendixto the EAMIP. The Guidelines would be intended to provide more detailedinformation on various requirements, most specifically on the employeesurvey. As stated previously, employee surveys would be required to meetcertain standards of completeness and coverage. The Implementation Guidelineswould contain these standards as well as a list of possible survey questions,techniques for evaluating the results of the survey, and a list of theinformation that should be presented on the survey in the trip reductionannual report. The Guidelines might also contain information on other topicsas appropriate. Costs to the Major Employer of Complying With the EAMIP In order for Major Employers to select cost-effective alternative modesincentives, EPA would regularly develop and update data on the effectivenessand costs of various alternative modes incentives and provide the informationto Major Employers. EPA would urge Major Employers to work with their employeesto determine which alternative modes incentives would be most effective.EPA would also encourage Major Employers to experiment with trip reductionstrategies to determine those that maximize reductions in SOV commute tripsand minimize the trip reduction program costs. Evaluation of trip reduction programs in jurisdictions that have TROs orin companies that have voluntary programs shows that substantial reductionsin trips can be achieved without great expense. K.T. Analytics, in developinginformation for MAG's Model Trip Reduction Working Group, reviewed severalemployer programs in the San Francisco Bay Area and found programs costingfrom $6.15 per employee to $55.00 per employee per year. Costs of the programswere directly related to how extensive the program was, with the highestcost being for programs that included shuttle buses or van services. Basedon its review, K.T. Analytics estimated that the cost for a small employer(less than 500 employees) for a modest program can run from $10,000 to$20,000 per year and for an extensive program, $30,000 to $60,000 per year.Cost for a large employer (more than 1,000 employees) for a modest programcan range from $30,000 to $60,000 per year and, for an extensive program,can be from $100,000 to $250,000 depending especially on whether shuttleor van services are included. EPA would encourage and assist smaller Major Employers to form transportationmanagement associations (TMAs) to meet the requirements of this regulation.By forming or joining TMAs, employers could hire a single transportationcoordinator for all members and can share resources and programs, therebyreducing the cost of the overall program to each Major Employer. The largerpool of employees in a TMA can also enhance the effectiveness of relativelylow-cost rideshare matching programs. EPA would also encourage Major Employersto use, to the maximum extent possible, the available public programs whichencourage ridesharing, transit use, bicycling or pedestrian travel. It would be EPA's intent to review from time to time the cost and benefitsof complying with the EAMIP for Major Employers in Maricopa County. EPAwould also solicit information from the Maricopa Region Advisory Committeeand the general public on the cost and benefits of compliance. The benefitsinclude decreased congestion, decreased trip times for non-affected commuters,delayed infrastructure investment, reduced employer parking requirements,and increased transit/rideshare usage. EPA would use this information and data on trip reduction levels being achieved to modify the regulationand adjust the trip reduction goals as appropriate.<T3>Expected Emission Reductions </T3>EPA is proposing today to regulate the same group of employers at the sametrip reduction level as the MAG Model Trip Reduction Ordinance discussedearlier in this notice. EPA estimates that the MAG model, if fully implemented,could reduce carbon monoxide emission by 1.8 percent by the end of 1991.EPA estimates that its proposed regulation would achieve the same emissionreduction as the MAG Model. Areas for Specific Comments on the Proposed EAMIP While EPA requests comments on all parts of its proposed regulation, itwould like specific comments on the following topics:a. The trip reduction goal in this proposal requires all Major Employers,independent of their size or location, to reduce SOV commute trips to theirworksite by 5 percent in the first year and an additional 5 percent inthe second year. EPA would like to solicit comments on whether this goalis appropriate. Specifically: _Are the proposed goals too stringent or too lenient? If either, what aremore appropriate goals? _Should the goal be the same for all Major Employers? Should larger employersbe required to meet higher goals than smaller employers? Should the goalsdepend on the location of the employer? For example, should employers inthe central business district of Phoenix be required to meet higher goalsthan employers in the outlying areas of Maricopa County? If goals shouldbe based on employer size or location, how should employers be groupedand what are appropriate goals for each group? _Should the trip reduction goal be based on reductions in single-occupant-vehiclecommute trips? Should the measure for trip reduction be a required levelof participation of all employees at a worksite in alternative modes suchas in the Pima TRO or should the goal be expressed as the average occupancyof vehicles driven to the worksite as in the South Coast (Los Angeles)Air Quality Management District's Regulation XV? _Finally, should the Major Employer be subject to possible enforcementaction if he fails to achieve the trip reduction goal after attemptingto do so after a given number of years? Should EPA only require an improvedtrip reduction plan as in the MAG model TRO? Or, as contained in S.B. 1181,should employers failing to achieve the goal be required to implement aspecific number of trip reduction strategies?b. Multi-tenant buildings and/or business parks are often major attractersof commute trips. Many of the employers in these developments though donot have more than 100 employees and would not be covered by this proposedregulation. Multi-tenant projects, however, because of their often sizeableemployee populations and compact sizes are well suited to trip reductionprograms such as the establishment of transportation management associations.EPA solicits comments on whether these multi-tenant developments shouldbe covered in the final regulation and, if so, what methods could be usedto regulate them. c. Various other measures can be taken by employers to reduce air pollutionfrom commute trips other than reductions in commute trips. Moving commutetrips out of the peak commute periods or converting vehicles to clean fuelssuch as neat methanol or compressed natural gas are two examples. EPA solicits comments on whether this proposed trip reduction regulationshould also give credit to employer programs that do not directly reducetrips yet still reduce carbon monoxide emissions. Specifically, EPA wouldlike comment on whether credit should be given to employer programs whichshift commute trips out of the peak commute periods. d. Are there other VMT reduction measures that EPA should be consideringalong with or in place of the EAMIP? e. Should EPA replace the EAMIP in the Maricopa federal implementationplan with a higher oxygenation level in the oxygenated fuels program alsoproposed in this notice? Given the prospective benefits of the two measures,are the higher costs and cost-effectiveness ratios of the EAMIP (relativeto the higher oxygenation program) justified? See section VIII on EconomicImpact. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. The Proposed Oxygenated Fuels Program </ITAG>The approved SIP commitments and the federal trip reduction regulation,if promulgated, will provide a significant, but relatively small amountof the overall 22.0 percent emission reduction required for Phoenix toattain the CO NAAQS in 1991. Specifically, an additional 17.35 percentreduction (expressed as the reduction from a baseline which includes theeffects of all other adopted controls) is needed from one or more controlmeasures. As already mentioned, the only remaining federally availablestrategy that appears capable of this degree of control without potentiallyunacceptable social and economic effects is an oxygenated fuels program.This is not to suggest that the measure is devoid of social and economicimplications, but relative to the other approaches it appears to be theonly viable alternative. It can also be geographically and temporally targetedto address the Phoenix wintertime non-attainment problem. Therefore, EPAis proposing an oxygenated fuels program with a required level of equivalentoxygen content (defined below) of 2.57 percent. If EPA does not promulgatethe proposed federal trip reduction regulation, the equivalent oxygen contentrequirement will be 2.79 percent as part of the FIP. The requisite equivalentoxygen content could be provided by a variety of oxygenated fuels. As anexample, the 2.57% equivalent oxygen content would be met by an 11% methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether(MTBE) blend and a 10% ethanol blend (Gasohol) with 44% and 56% marketshares, respectively. Similarly, the 2.79% content requirement would bemet by 11% MTBE and Gasohol with market shares of 39% and 61%, respectively.(Various oxygenated fuel program options and EPA's proposed evaluationof any subsequent SIP submission are thoroughly described in Section VI.2.)The specific use of oxygenated fuels to reduce the CO emissions from motorvehicles is a recent development in air pollution control strategies. Tofacilitate an understanding of the many issues involved in implementingthis program, a brief background discussion of oxygenated fuels in generalis presented next. This is followed by a description of the Agency's rationalefor choosing a particular form of ``oxygenated'' fuels program and a discussionof the specific elements that comprise EPA's proposal. Also, the effectson the proposal of EPA's action on a pending application for a section211(f) waiver for a particular oxygenated fuel are summarized. Finally,EPA's decision not to propose gasoline volatility controls as part of theFIP is stated and explained. Background for Oxygenated Fuels a. <T3>Description of Oxygenated Fuels. </T3>Gasoline is a complex mixtureof many different hydrocarbon species or compounds. These hydrocarbonsare extracted and modified from crude oil, and in some cases, from theliquids associated with natural gas production. Elemental constituentsother than hydrogen and carbon are present only in very low concentrations.Their presence is primarily a consequence of impurities in the crude oil,which are not completely removed in refining, or occurs because the refineradds special compounds to the product to improve its detergency, corrosioncharacteristics, or chemical stability in storage. Vehicle manufacturersdesign their engines to operate satisfactorily on this fairly uniform andessentially pure hydrocarbon fuel. The concept behind an oxygenated fuels program is to require that fuelsold in a CO nonattainment area contain a concentration of elemental oxygenthat is well above that normally present in gasoline (e.g., an oxygen concentrationin the range of 1.5 to 3.7 percent by weight). Such levels can only beachieved by adding chemical compounds that contain oxygen and are misciblein gasoline. The most suitable, available, and economical compounds forthis purpose are low molecular weight alcohols and ethers, genericallyreferred to as oxygenate compounds or oxygenates. Table 2 lists some oxygenatingcompounds commonly used in gasoline. As will become clear later, the amount(volume) of an oxygenate, or a mixture of two or more oxygenates, thatmust be added to gasoline to achieve a given concentration of oxygen inthe final blend depends on the oxygenate's chemical composition, specificallythe fraction of its mass which is oxygen. b. <T3>Federal Regulation of Oxygenated Fuels. </T3>Section 211 of the CleanAir Act broadly provides for the regulation of fuels and fuel additives.Of particular interest with regard to today's action are two of the conditionswhich govern the content of fuels. The first is contained in section 211(f)(1),which prohibits the introduction into commerce of fuels for general usethat are not ``substantially similar'' to the fuel used by EPA and thevehicle manufacturers in the emissions certification testing of 1975 andnewer vehicles. The Agency interprets this section to limit the compositionof unleaded gasoline only, as leaded gasoline is not for general use in1975 and newer cars. The meaning of ``substantially similar'' has been established by an EPAinterpretative rule (46 FR 38582, July 28, 1981). The important aspectof this interpretation with respect to an oxygenated fuels program is thatthe fuel must contain no more than 2.0 percent oxygen by weight. Perhapsthe most notable example of an oxygenated fuel that may be marketed underthe substantially similar ruling is up to 11 percent MTBE by volume inunleaded gasoline. Low level blends using other ethers or various alcoholsare also permissible. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,r25 </C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Oxygen-Containing Compounds Commonly Used in Gasoline </T4><H1>Oxygenate </H1><H1>Chemical formula</H1>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Methanol (Methyl Alcohol) <D>CH</D><T2>3</T2>OH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethanol (Ethyl Alcohol) <D>CH</D><T2>3</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>OH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Propanol (Propyl Alcohol) <D>CH</D><T2>3</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>OH (and isomers) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Butanol (Butyl Alcohol) <D>C(CH</D><T2>3</T2>)<T2>3</T2>OH (and isomers) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) <D>C(CH</D><T2>3</T2>)<T2>3</T2>OCH<T2>3</T2></ITAG></ITAG> The second condition is contained in section 211(f)(4), which allows theabove prohibition to be waived upon EPA's approval if specifically requestedby a manufacturer, or provides for automatically granting a waiver applicationif EPA does not act to deny such a request within 180 days. A number ofwaivers for oxygenated fuels have been approved or automatically granted.Table 3 shows several of the more prominent waivers that are currentlyin effect, along with their corresponding oxygen content. There are several important implications of EPA's substantially similarruling and the section 211(f) waivers with respect to today's action. First,oxygen contents up to 3.7 percent are legal using ethanol as the oxygenateor using any of several mixtures of methanol and other alcohols. Second,blends containing more than 2.0 percent oxygen in any form except ethanolmust comply with the otherwise voluntary limits on gasoline volatilityestablished by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) forthe location and time of year of their intended sale. These limits areexpressed as the maximum Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of the fuel, which isa measure of the tendency of gasoline to evaporate at 100 degrees Fahrenheit.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,xs40,r25,7 </C><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>Examples of Currently Approved Oxygenated Fuel Waivers </T4><H1>Common content name </H1><H1>Primary constituents in unleaded gasoline (volume percent) </H1><H1>Maximum oxygen (weight percent)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Gasohol <D>Up to 10% Ethanol by Volume </D><D>3.7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">DuPont <D>Up to 5% Methanol with at least 2.5% Other Alcohols </D><D>3.7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Oxinol-50 <D>Up to 4.75% Methanol and 4.75% Tertiary Butyl Alcohol (TBA) (Ratio ofMethanol: TBA </D>andCx.190;1) <D>3.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Octamix <D>Up to 5% Methanol and a Minimum of 2.5% Higher Alcohols </D><D>3.7</D></ITAG></ITAG> Third, ethanol blends are not currently subject to any Federal restrictionson RVP (although EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on thissubject on August 19, 1987). Fourth, and finally, MTBE may be used in gasolineonly up to an oxygen content of 2.0 percent, because no waiver has beengranted for MTBE blends beyond this level. A waiver request for MTBE upto concentrations corresponding to approximately 2.7 percent oxygen isnow pending EPA action and is discussed later. Questions have arisen concerning the composition of base gasoline for usein ethanol blending, particularly with respect to the use of MTBE. Thegasohol waiver was granted in 1978 with conditions as stated by the applicant.Those conditions were that anhydrous ethanol may be added up to 10% byvolume in the final blend. No mention of oxygenate composition in the basegasoline was made. However, MTBE was not in use at that time, nor wereany other oxygenates, with the exception of small amounts of methanol usedas a deicer. Consequently, the Agency's policy has been that the base gasolineused to blend ethanol must be oxygenate-free. However, in order to usein ethanol blending, the Agency has advised ethanol blenders (and methanolblenders) that they may use unleaded gasoline containing up to 2.0 percentMTBE by volume in ethanol blends (and DuPont and Octamix methanol blends)provided that the MTBE is present only as a result of unintentional comminglingduring transport and storage. c. <T3>Performance and Emission Qualities of Oxygenate Fuels. </T3>Blendsof gasoline and oxygenates have three important effects when used in vehiclesdesigned for essentially pure hydrocarbon gasoline. First, they have ahigher octane rating which tends to suppress engine knocking or pinging.This has no significant environmental effect, but it can partially offsetthe additional cost to the refiner if the refiner takes advantage of theoctane increase by decreasing the octane of the base gasoline. If the refinerdoes not, some late model cars with self-adjusting ignition timing mayget a small fuel economy increase from the higher octane fuel and somecars that were knocking may stop. Otherwise, the extra octane has no practicaleffect. Second, all oxygenates affect the volatility of the gasoline, i.e., itstendency to evaporate at various temperatures. In some cases, the changesin volatility are large enough that compensating changes in the base gasolineare needed so that the final blend meets the legal limits and/or the refiner'sown standards for marketability. Unless completely compensated, these volatilitychanges may increase a vehicle's evaporative hydrocarbon emissions (i.e.,fuel which evaporates and escapes to the air before it is burned in theengine). The implication of this phenomenon with regard to the potentialCO reduction from various types of oxygenated fuels is discussed later.Third, and most important in the case of Phoenix, the presence of chemicallybound oxygen in the fuel affects the relative amounts of burnable fueland oxygen reaching the combustion chambers of the engine, shifting themixture to relatively more oxygen. This usually results in more completeoxidation of the fuel and lower exhaust emissions of unburned hydrocarbons(HC) and of carbon monoxide (CO). Of the two pollutants, CO is usuallyreduced by the larger percentage. Emissions of oxides of nitrogen are affectedless strongly and may increase or decrease somewhat. Test results showthat the CO reductions associated with oxygenated fuels vary significantlyfrom vehicle to vehicle. This indicates that the CO benefits from thesefuels depend on a vehicle's design and how well it has been maintained.Nonetheless, reasonably consistent reductions ``on average'' have beenobserved for groups of vehicles with similar engine designs and emissioncontrol systems. Also, for a given group of vehicles, the CO reductionappears to be dependent on the net oxygen content of the gasoline/oxygenateblend and on its volatility characteristics. There is no apparent correlationbetween size of CO reduction and the specific oxygenate used in the blend.d. <T3>EPA Guidance on Estimating Emissions from Oxygenated Fuels. </T3>Becauseoxygenated fuels affect the CO emissions of different types of vehiclesdifferently, and because the vehicle fleet in an urban area is a constantlychanging mix of the different types of vehicles, a complicated calculationof their effect on overall fleet CO emissions is required to assess theircontribution as a CO attainment strategy. The Agency's instructions forperforming this analysis are contained in ``Guidance on Estimating MotorVehicle Emission Reductions From The Use of Alternative Fuels and FuelBlends,'' which was published on January 29, 1988. [Reference 1] This reportis the basis of the emission reduction estimates contained in today's notice.The assumptions, methods, and conclusions of the report have not been formallysubjected to public comment prior to this notice. Comments on the analysisare specifically requested and will be considered in formulating EPA'sfinal action. A copy of the document has been placed in the public docketfor this action, and included in the Draft Technical Support Document,to facilitate this review. Previous informal comments on a draft of thedocument have also been included in the public docket. While the intricacies of EPA's guidance document will not be discussedhere, a few conclusions from the document are valuable as background forthe description of the proposed Federal oxygenated fuels program. To begin,EPA finds that the CO emission reduction associated with using oxygenatedfuels should be estimated by separating vehicles into three technologygroups: Non-catalyst, catalyst with open-loop engine operation (i.e., non-computercontrolled), and catalyst with closed-loop engine operation. Increasinglymore of the Phoenix fleet falls into the last group, for which the averageCO reduction is somewhat smaller (maximum of 21.4 percent versus 24.5 percentand 34.9 percent for the first and second groups, respectively). Therefore,the overall fleet CO reduction from an oxygenated fuels program, in percentageand absolute (tons per day) terms, will decrease somewhat over time. For each of the three technology groups, the average CO reduction dependson the net oxygen content of the fuel, and on the difference between theRVP of the oxygenated gasoline and that of the oxygen-free gasoline thatis used as the baseline for determining the emission reductions. (In thecase of Phoenix, the baseline gasoline would be what is normally sold during1991 in the absence of any change otherwise required by a SIP and/or FIPaction. The MAG plan implicitly assumes this will be the same as the gasolinesold in 1985.) Any volatility differences in fuels, other than RVP, aretreated as being so small in degree and/or in CO emissions effects, thatthey can be ignored. If an oxygenated fuel has a higher RVP than the baselinegasoline, its CO reduction will be less than a comparably oxygenated fuel(i.e., same oxygen content) with an RVP equal to the baseline gasoline.Of the common oxygenates, only methanol and ethanol cause RVP to increasewhen added to gasoline. The RVP increase is not linear with alcohol content.Instead, any alcohol level above 2 percent by volume tends to have thesame absolute effect on RVP. The average effect with ethanol is about 0.76pounds per square inch (psi); the average methanol effect is about 2 psi.MTBE does not cause RVP to increase. Therefore, at equal oxygen contents,an alcohol blend will have a smaller CO reduction than an MTBE blend, unlessthe gasoline portion of the alcohol blend has been modified to compensatefor the volatility increase. As noted above, however, unleaded alcoholblends may legally have a higher oxygen content than an MTBE blend. Therefore,the maximum potential CO benefit with a legal alcohol blend may be greaterthan that of any legal MTBE blend. (This is not true for blends of leadedgasoline, because the amount of oxygenate is not restricted.) If the RVPincrease is fully compensated, the CO advantage of the alcohol blends iseven greater. e. <T3>Driveability and Materials Compatibility. </T3>Numerous studies haveevaluated the driveability of alcohol blends compared to ``clear'' gasoline.Several symptoms such as hesitation, stalling, and hard starting have beenreported to varying degrees. The Agency has evaluated these studies andbelieves the driveability of many vehicles on low level alcohol blendsappears to be roughly equivalent to that of gasoline. However, some vehiclesappear to be more susceptible to certain driveability-related problemswith alcohol blends (and some owners are more perceptive of them). Theseare generally the older, carburetor equipped vehicles without electronicengine controls. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that some drivers willexperience changes in the operation of their vehicles, although EPA believesthat the percentage of such individuals in the Phoenix area will be small.To the extent that these problems do occur, they can be alleviated by switchingto a lower oxygen content fuel. As discussed later in today's notice, theproposed Federal oxygenated fuel program would allow such fuels to be marketedin the Phoenix area. There is also a concern regarding the compatibility of vehicle/engine materialsand alcohol blends. The more important of these concerns falls into twobasic areas. The first area involves the effect of alcohol blends on plasticsand elastomers. At concentrations much higher than EPA waivered levels,some alcohol blends may cause these materials to swell or weaken. However,alcohol blends at EPA waivered levels are not expected to cause such problems.The second area involves the loosening of rust and scale in service stationand vehicle tanks, and the related problem of added corrosion. Regardingthe suspension of corrosion products or sediment, this phenomenon has beenfound to occur with alcohol blends to some degree and may cause a vehicle'sfuel filter to become plugged. This type of problem is most likely to occurwhen gasoline/alcohol blends are first used, but generally would not occurafterwards and is easily corrected by replacing the fuel filter. It shouldalso be noted that ethanol blends have been widely used and fuel filterclogging has not been a serious problem. Regarding impacts on corrosion rate, it has been shown that ethanol blendswithout any corrosion inhibitor additives are more corrosive than typicalgasoline. This may be due in part to the fact that ethanol is often blendedfrom unbranded gasoline that may lack even the level and types of additivesnormally found in branded gasoline, and not just because the ethanol posesan increased threat of corrosion. However, virtually all ethanol now suppliedfor blending with gasoline has special additives to control this effect.Again, non-alcohol blends do not appear to exhibit these phenomena. Therefore,to the extent that these problems occur, they can be completely alleviatedby the use of a non-alcohol gasoline. The proposed Federal alternativefuels program discussed later would allow such fuels to be marketed. A more detailed discussion of these, and other, aspects of using oxygenatedfuels is contained in the Draft Technical Support Document for this action.The interested readers, therefore, should consult that document. The Agencyhas also included additional information on these subjects for public inspectionin the rulemaking docket. f. <T3>Phoenix Gasoline Supply and Marketing. </T3>Nearly all of the gasolineconsumed in Maricopa County is supplied by two pipelines. Each deliverspetroleum products from refiners outside the State to a large storage anddistribution terminal in Phoenix. One pipeline originates from the LosAngeles, California area and is generally referred to as the ``west line.''The other originates from El Paso, Texas and is usually referred to asthe ``east line.'' Both pipelines are owned and operated by the SouthernPacific Pipe Line Inc. (SPPL). This company operates as a common carrierunder the Interstate Commerce Act. As such, it functions solely as a transporterof petroleum products, and must treat all shippers in a non-discriminatory,equitable manner. The west line is the larger of the two pipelines, accounting for about90 percent of the Phoenix deliveries. It is also more complex in operation.Petroleum products are received into the pipeline system from ten refineryand terminal sources in the Los Angeles area. Upon receipt, the fuel isimmediately placed in ``breakout'' storage tanks at SPPL's Watson, Californiaterminal (near the Los Angeles harbor). This tankage is required to accumulateenough of each fuel type to provide scheduling flexibility and to accommodatethe differences in the flow rates between the refineries and the firstsegment of the pipeline. The minimum quantity of any particular fuel acceptedfor transport is 420,000 gallons, but such small ``batches'' are rare.Regular customers may ship fuel of a given grade through the pipeline approximatelyfour times each month. From the Watson terminal, petroleum products are sent through the pipelineto Colton, California (between San Bernardino and Riverside). There itis handled in one of three ways depending on the ultimate destination.First, fuel may be diverted directly to local terminals serving the SanBernardino/Riverside, California area. Secondly, fuel may be deliveredand stored in another pipeline company's breakout tankage for subsequentdelivery to Las Vegas, Nevada. Third, and finally, fuel may be stored inseparate SPPL breakout tankage for delivery by SPPL to either the ImperialValley area of California or Phoenix. In this latter case, products arepumped from the breakout tankage into the Colton/Phoenix pipeline segment.SPPL must use breakout tankage in Colton even for fuel destined to theImperial Valley and Phoenix because the pipeline segment east of Coltonpumps at a slower rate than the segment between Watson and Colton. Presently, only three types of gasoline have separate breakout tankageassociated with the west line: Regular leaded, regular unleaded, and premiumunleaded. Any gasoline which is substantially different with regard tolead content, octane, and volatility (or oxygen content) cannot be transportedwith the system's existing operating practices. Within certain bounds,however, adjustments in pipeline operations may be possible to compensatefor some differences in fuels. For example, if a suboctane unleaded fuelis put through the regular unleaded breakout tank, the next batch of ``normal''octane fuel would have to be refined to have a slightly higher than normaloctane to accommodate the dilution with the heel of the suboctane fuel.Similar adjustments might also be possible for fuels with different RVPsand oxygen contents. In particular, SPPL has indicated that it could meetthe maximum contamination level of 2 percent MTBE by volume that mightbe associated with MTBE blends, in unleaded fuel destined to be blendedwith ethanol. Nonetheless, along the continuum of feasibility, the pipeline's operationalflexibility may become increasingly compromised as more fuel types mustbe handled. At some point, the trade-off between accommodating differentfuels and the associated cost of operation can become so burdensome thatthe time- consuming construction of new breakout tankage dedicated to thisservice becomes practically necessary or at least economically justified.This is a potentially significant consideration if reducing air pollutionin Arizona were to require special gasolines. (The ramifications of suchan event are discussed later in this section.)The east line delivers about 10 percent of the gasoline received in Phoenix,and is relatively simple in its operation. Petroleum products enter thepipeline directly from the terminal storage areas of four refiners in ElPaso. There are no breakout facilities associated with east line operations,since all pipeline segments flow at the same rate. The minimum quantityof any petroleum product accepted for shipment is 210,000 gallons. (Thispipeline also supplies virtually all of Tucson's gasoline.) As already noted, upon reaching Phoenix the petroleum products are deliveredinto a large terminal area where they are stored for later distributionand sale. The terminal is composed primarily of a central manifolding areafor handling the various products, and a large number of individual storagetanks. The tanks themselves are owned by the following companies, utilities,or government entities: SPPL, Shell, Chevron, Unocal, Powerline, ARCO,Texaco, CALJET, City of Phoenix, Maricopa County, Salt River Project, andArizona Public Service Company. These storage facilities are either usedexclusively by the owner or may be leased, in whole or part, to other companies.SPPL in particular does not own any of the fuel stored in its tanks, butinstead leases them to others or charges a service fee for their intermittentuse. The terminal is also accessible by railroad, although this serviceis apparently not being used at present. Pipeline deliveries to Phoenix may change somewhat in the future. Fuelshipments through the west line are presently constrained by the pipeline'scapacity. Also, gasoline delivered through the east line is somewhat moreexpensive, primarily due to differences in crude oil prices and refiningeconomics. As a result, the west line is presently being expanded by SPPL(i.e., increased diameter and increased flow rates), with the new pipelineprojected for completion in 1989. Once the expansion is complete, SPPLexpects to supply nearly all of the gasoline to Phoenix and probably Tucsonthrough this single line. Turning to the marketing of fuels, approximately 1.12 billion gallons ofgasoline products were delivered by pipeline to the Phoenix terminal in1987. This represents about 3 million gallons per day. Because of the populationdistribution within the trading area of the Phoenix terminal, most of thisfuel is assumed to be used within the Phoenix non-attainment area. However,some smaller communities in Arizona (e.g., Flagstaff) may receive virtuallyall their fuel by tank truck delivery from this Phoenix terminal. The quality of all gasoline-type motor vehicle fuel consumed in Arizonais currently regulated by Section 41-2083 of the Revised Arizona Statutes.That section requires conformance with the specifications established bythe American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), as contained indocument D439-83. The specifications include maximum allowable limits onfuel volatility. (The potential significance of this specification willbecome clear later.) Additionally, the gasoline normally marketed in thePhoenix area reportedly contains no alcohol additives and only, a traceof Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE). [Reference 2] This latter compoundis currently used by some U.S. refiners as an octane enhancer in concentrationsof up to a few percent. There are approximately 800 public refueling facilities in Maricopa County.Major oil companies, and their affiliates, dominate the Phoenix marketboth in number of service stations and total gasoline sales. The Phoenixarea also appears to have about 38 gasoline wholesalers. Most are presumablyin the business of delivering gasoline by tank truck to retail and otherrefueling facilities. Those that do not themselves import gasoline viathe SPPL pipelines purchase it at the Phoenix terminal from companies whichdo.  Oxygenated Fuels Option Selection The first step in implementing an oxygenated fuels program is to decideon its overall design. The predominant consideration in making this decisionis that the CO benefit from these fuels is primarily dependent on the oxygenconcentration of the gasoline consumed in the geographic area of concern.So in structuring the program to provide a certain emission reduction,the ultimate goal can be thought of as ensuring that a specific oxygenconcentration target is attained. (The actual oxygen target for the Phoenixarea is discussed later in this section.) There are three basic programdesigns that will accomplish this. Each is described below and EPA's preferredoption for the proposal is identified. The first option involves establishing a single minimum oxygen concentrationfor all gasoline. The minimum would be set at the level necessary to providethe required CO reduction. This concept is being used by the State of Coloradoin its alternative fuels program, with a minimum specification of 2 percentoxygen by weight. At this low level, none of the current oxygenated fuelblends currently permissible under EPA unleaded gasoline waivers wouldbe prohibited. The minimum specification for the Phoenix area currentlywould need to be greater than this value to provide the required CO reduction.Such a requirement has a significantly different effect on fuels availability,as noted below. The advantage of this option lies in the consistency of the regulatoryrequirement for all octane grades of gasoline (i.e., regular leaded, regularunleaded, midgrade unleaded if present in the market, and premium unleaded).This consistency would minimize confusion by consumers over the level andtype of oxygenate being marketed. The regulatory requirements also wouldbe more straightforward for the affected business community and, similarly,enforcement would be greatly simplified. Compliance with the regulatorystandard could be directly monitored through sampling and testing of gasolinein the control area, rather than relying on oversight of a self-reportingsystem. The principal disadvantage is that it can significantly limit thechoice of fuels in the marketplace. For example, the availability of ``clear''gasoline (i.e., oxygen-free) would be precluded. Also, as already mentioned,the oxygen target for the Phoenix area would be above 2.0 percent. Thiscurrently precludes the availability of alcohol-free, unleaded fuels. Specifically,the marketing of 11 percent MTBE with 2 percent oxygen by weight, whichis universally recognized as a fully satisfactory fuel in all vehicle types,would be prohibited. (The implications of a recent waiver request for upto 15 percent MTBE is discussed later in this section.) A limitation on the choice of fuels available is an important considerationin that a small percentage of owners may require (in their own perceptionif not in fact) an alcohol-free fuel for the satisfactory operation oftheir vehicles. Beyond this small group, the simple availability of variousfuels may be critical in garnering public acceptance and support for anoxygenated fuels program. This limitation would also reduce the marketingflexibility of fuel suppliers as compared to other potential program designs.It could reduce or eliminate competition between blending agents and causeprices to artificially rise. The second basic option involves establishing a minimun oxygen concentrationby octane grade (or generally specifying oxygen content with an allowancefor one unspecified grade to contain some other concentration). As an example,one grade could be specified with a minimum of 2 percent oxygen by weightto allow MTBE in the market. Other grades would be specified at a higherminimum requirement, which could be met with alcohol blends. The selectionprocess, of course, must be governed by ensuring the required emissionreduction is achieved.This program option overcomes the principal problem associated with settinga single minimum oxygen concentration for all gasoline, in that an alternativeblend could be made available for those consumers wishing to purchase gasolinecontaining no alcohol. Under certain scenarios it might be possible, thoughunlikely, to offer an oxygen-free fuel. Beyond this, much of the firstoption's advantage of simplified enforcement is retained, especially ifthe low-oxygen grade was specified by regulation rather than determinedby free market conditions. Unfortunately, such an action would continue to significantly affect consumerchoice and free market activities. A further disadvantage of this optionrelates to the uncertainty of attaining the requisite oxygen concentrationtarget from the mix of fuels. The market shares for the various fuel grades,and the resulting oxygen content, will depend on the vehicle fleet composition(e.g., catalyst versus non-catalyst equipped vehicles), and the degreeto which consumers switch fuels to obtain an alcohol-free or low-oxygenblend. Predicting these effects and setting oxygen requirements with certaintyis problematic. Of course, it may be possible to overcome this difficulty by either limitingin some way the availability of the low-oxygen blend, setting the requiredconcentration of the high-oxygen blend at the maximum allowable level,or by using some combination of these approaches. Such a solution, however,further negates some of the potential advantages of this option. Also,by setting the oxygen requirements at a higher level than actually necessary,the cost of the program could be unnecessarily increased. Finally, if othertypes of oxygenates became available with oxygen contents between the low-and high-level specifications (e.g., 15 percent MTBE with 2.7 percent oxygenby weight) the program design may have to be reconsidered to allow forsuch new fuels. The third, and final, basic option involves the concept of averaging. Thistype of program is used by EPA in the gasoline lead phasedown program.It can be adapted to an oxygenated fuels program by establishing an averageoxygen target at the level needed to achieve the required CO reductions.Gasoline suppliers must, at a minimum, meet this average value over a specifiedtime period. This can be done by always selling fuel with an oxygen contentat or above the requisite value, or by adjusting the quantities and typesof fuel sold over the averaging period to attain the requisite value. The principal advantage of this program design is that the requisite emissionreduction can be achieved with a minimum of regulatory intrusion into themarketplace. It also appears to retain the maximum degree of marketingflexibility, competition between blending agents, and consumer choice.These advantageous aspects of the averaging program can be further enhancedby allowing suppliers to trade ``oxygen credits'' among themselves, witha supplier of relatively low oxygen fuels being able to purchase such creditsfrom a supplier of relatively high-oxygen fuel. The primary disadvantageof this approach is the associated increase in the amount of recordkeepingand reporting. A significant amount of additional data is required underthis program design for suppliers to track their average oxygen concentrations,to allow for the trading of oxygen credits, and to provide a mechanismfor program enforcement. Even with such reporting and recordkeeping requirements,however, program enforceability may be difficult. In weighing the apparent advantages and disadvantages in the context ofthe relatively substantial CO reductions needed from an oxygenated fuelsprogram in the Phoenix area, EPA believes that the averaging and tradingapproach on balance appears preferable to the other basic implementationoptions. Specifically, the advantages of maximizing consumer choice andmarketing flexibility outweigh the disadvantages associated with the increasein recordkeeping and added enforcement burden. Nonetheless, although EPA currently prefers to implement the proposed oxygenatedfuels progran with an averaging and trading scheme, comments are specificallyrequested on the possibility of specifying a minimum oxygen content for``each batch'' of gasoline or for each octane grade, or some variationof this approach, as an alternative to averaging. This simpler programdesign may be advantageous if the recent request by Sun Oil for a waiverpermitting up to 15 percent MTBE blends is approved. Similarly, as discussedlater, it may also be a feasible alternative if the State of Arizona adoptsadditional control measures that would reduce the emissions control necessaryfrom an alternative fuels program, and allow an average oxygen concentrationof 2 percent or less. Description of the Oxygenated Fuels Program As noted above, the Agency is proposing to implement an oxygenated fuelsprogram for the Phoenix area with an optional averaging and trading compliancescheme. The specific elements of the overall program are described below.a. <T3>Program Duration. </T3>The intent of the program is to provide thebenefits of vehicular operation on oxygenated fuels during the time ofyear when the Phoenix area would otherwise experience exceedances of theCO NAAQS. In the last three years, the peak CO monitoring site in Phoenixrecorded several exceedances of the CO 8-hour standard in the April toSeptember period and the highest of these was recorded on April 23, 1985.(Actual air quality data can be found in the TSD). Although these exceedancesfall outside of the proposed program duration dates for the oxygenatedfuels program, EPA is concerned with the potential for gasoline volatilityincreases in the warmer months of April through September if the programwere extended to cover those months and its potential effect of exacerbatingozone formation (described elsewhere in the notice). However, EPA believesthat the control measures in the MAG plan, including the increasing effectivenessof the I/M program, along with the emission reduction benefit of the phasingin and out of oxygenated gasoline stock before and after the proposed programdates (an approximate two week period), will eliminate these higher concentrationsfound in the months outside of the program. EPA solicits comment on thisissue. To assure that the gasoline dispensed from a refueling facility containsthe requisite oxygen content, some phase-in must be included in the programto allow for the normal ``turnover'' of fuel in the refueling facilities'storage tanks. The limited information currently available indicates thatthis phenomenon usually takes at most two weeks for refueling facilitiesthat handle the large majority of the fuel used in an urban area. Therefore,EPA proposes that the mandatory compliance period begin on October 1 ofeach calendar year and end on March 31 of the subsequent calendar year,beginning with the effective date of the program. During this complianceperiod, all gasoline first introduced into commerce within the controlarea (including gasoline deliveries to public or private refueling facilities)must meet the requirements of the oxygenated fuels program as prescribedby regulation. Any other regulatory requirements that may specificallyapply to refueling entities (e.g., labeling) must also be adhered to duringthis period. Comments are specifically requested on the need for a longer complianceperiod, or the adequacy of a shorter period. b. <T3>Geographic Scope. </T3>The requirements of the oxygenated fuels programwould apply to all gasoline first introduced into commerce within the boundariesof the Maricopa County non-attainment area as prescribed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>by EPA on March 3, 1978 (43 FR 8964). The areaencompasses twenty-two cities and towns, including the City of Phoenixand portions of unincorporated area within Maricopa County. Comments arespecifically requested on the need for and disadvantages of, enlargingthe geographic scope of the program to include more or all of MaricopaCounty. c. <T3>Oxygen Content Specification. </T3>As discussed previously, the variousoxygenated fuels may exhibit different clean air potentials. Current oxygenatedfuels made with ether-based compounds as the blending agent yield equivalentCO reductions for each percent oxygen they contain. This is not necessarilythe case, however, for oxygenated fuels made with alcohol-based compoundsas the blending agent. These latter blends can increase the volatilityof the gasoline, which offsets some of the potential benefit of their oxygencontent in reducing CO emissions under at least some ambient conditionsencountered in Phoenix. The degree of this offset varies with the compositionand RVP of the base gasoline, and with the amount and type of alcohol usedin the blend. For ethanol blends, the RVP increase is nearly always 1.0psi or less, and averages about 0.76 psi. Presently, it appears that theonly alcohol-based blends that are likely to be marketed in the Phoenixarea are those using ethanol as the blending agent. Therefore, the followingdiscussion will focus primarily on ethanol, although it generally pertainsto other alcohol blending agents as well. In practice, the only way to limit or avoid the CO offset described abovefor alcohol-based blends is to use a low volatility gasoline as the blendingstock so that the resulting fuel is no more volatile than the non-oxygenatedgasoline that normally would be marketed. Due to economic considerationsthis occurs only if the blend would otherwise exceed an applicable regulatorylimit on gasoline volatility. Therefore, the CO offset would apply to alcoholblends in the Phoenix area, unless a regulatory constraint forced suchfuels to be made with low volatility gasoline as the blending stock. In making this determination, the potential regulatory constraint of immediateinterest is Arizona's statutory requirement that prohibits all gasoline-typefuel, including ethanol blends, from exceeding the ASTM recommended limitson RVP. The maximum allowable RVP levels, as set forth in Section 41-2083of the Arizona Revised Statutes, during the months encompassing the mandatorycompliance period of the proposed oxygenated fuels program are: October,10.0 pounds per square inch (psi); November, 11.5 psi; December, 13.5 psi;January, 13.5 psi; February, 13.5; and March, 11.5 psi. The issue at thispoint is whether the oxygen free gasoline supplied to Phoenix has a lowenough volatility to accommodate all or most of the approximately 0.76psi average increase in RVP of ethanol blends within the State maximumvolatility limits. The Agency currently has only a limited amount of data on the RVP levelsof gasoline in the Phoenix area. The available information includes theaverage monthly RVP levels for one petroleum company's pipeline shipmentsinto Arizona from September 1986 through August 1987. [Reference 1] Theaverage monthly RVP values during the six months of interest range from0.4-3.3 psi below the Arizona standards, with all but two months havinglevels at least 1.1 psi below the limits. The minimum monthly RVP valuesrange from 1.3-6.0 psi under the standards, with only two months beingless than 2.6 under the limits. This data is supplemented by a January1987 survey of fuel from service stations in Phoenix that showed an averageRVP of 12.5 psi. [Reference 1] This indicates that the 0.76 psi increase in RVP, which is associated withthe average ethanol blends, could be accommodated within the State limitsby selecting normal gasoline shipments with an appropriately low volatilityas the blending stock. Because of this, EPA proposes to account (as describedbelow) for the CO offset associated with the higher RVP of alcohol blendsin the oxygenated fuels program, unless it is conclusively demonstratedthat the volatility of such fuels will on average match that of the alcohol-freegasoline that would otherwise be available in the Phoenix area. If Arizonasubsequently adopts a volatility exemption for alcohol-based blends (e.g.,an RVP margin of 1 psi), alcohol-based blends clearly will not match thatof other gasoline. However, if Arizona also reduces the basic RVP limitfor other fuels so that even with any exemption alcohol blends cannot exceedthe average RVP of Phoenix's current gasoline supply (which EPA believesis about 1 psi below the legal limit), the accounting procedure describedbelow will not apply in the final rule. The Agency finds the relative difference anong the various oxygenated gasolinesin reducing CO emissions is easily accounted for by expressing the ``actual''oxygen content of each fuel in terms of its ``equivalent'' oxygen content.These values are then used, as described subsequently, to determine compliancewith the program. Specifically, the equivalent oxygen content for non-alcoholblends is simply equal to the actual oxygen content (e.g., 11 percent MTBEequals 2.0 percent equivalent oxygen content). For ethanol blends of 1to 10 percent by volume, the actual oxygen content is converted to theequivalent as illustrated in Table 4. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>4._<T4>Oxygen Equivalence of Various Fuel Blends in the Alternative FuelsProgram </T4><H1>Actual </H1><H2>Nominal </H2><H3>Concentration of oxygenate (volume percent) </H3><H3>MTBE blend </H3><H1>Equivalent </H1><H2>Oxygen content (percent) \1\ </H2><H3>Ethanol blend \2\ </H3><H3>MTBE blend </H3><H2>Oxygen content (percent) </H2><H3>Ethanol blend \2\</H3> <ITAG tagnum="1">0 <D>0.00 </D><D>0.00 </D><D>0.00 </D><D>0.00 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1 <D>0.18 </D><D>0.37 </D><D>0.18 </D><D>0.11 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2 <D>0.36 </D><D>0.74 </D><D>0.36 </D><D>0.22 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3 <D>0.54 </D><D>1.11 </D><D>0.54 </D><D>0.60 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4 <D>0.73 </D><D>1.48 </D><D>0.73 </D><D>0.98 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5 <D>0.91 </D><D>1.85 </D><D>0.91 </D><D>1.37 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6 <D>1.09 </D><D>2.22 </D><D>1.09 </D><D>1.75 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7 <D>1.27 </D><D>2.59 </D><D>1.27 </D><D>2.14 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8 <D>1.45 </D><D>2.96 </D><D>1.45 </D><D>2.52 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">9 <D>1.63 </D><D>3.33 </D><D>1.63 </D><D>2.90 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">\3\ 10 <D>1.82 </D><D>3.70 </D><D>1.82 </D><D>3.29 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">\4\ 11 <D>2.00 </D><D> </D><D>2.00</D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">12 <D>2.18 </D><D> </D><D>2.18</D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13 <D>2.36 </D><D> </D><D>2.36</D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">14 <D>2.54 </D><D> </D><D>2.54</D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">15 <D>2.72 </D><D> </D><D>2.72</D><D> </D><F>Notes: </F><F>\1\ As determined by the proposed measurement procedure. </F><F>\2\ Methanol blends in the Phoenix market would be treated similarlyunder current Arizona RVP limits. </F><F>\3\ 3 Ethanol greater than 10 percent by volume in unleaded gasolineis prohibited.

Theactual oxygen content will also be used as the entry point to Table 2 forethanol blends containing small amounts of other oxygenate compounds. Additionalinformation relating to the volatility increase associated with methanolblends, as well as ethanol and MTBE blends, is contained in an EPA technicalreport on estimating the potential emission reductions associated withalternative fuels. [Reference 1] In the past, for the most waivered unleaded gasoline blends containingalcohol (specifically, gasohol and Texas Methanol and DuPont methanol/cosolventblends), EPA has not pursued enforcement action if up to two percent MTBEwere present in the blend as a result of unintentional commingling of thebase gasoline during transport and storage. The purpose behind this enforcementdiscretion was to make blendstock for alcohol blending more available,but not to encourage the purposeful mixing of unwaivered oxygenate blends.To avoid encouraging such purposeful mixing, the Agency is consideringnot allowing the contribution of oxygen from MTBE in the calculation ofactual (or equivalent) oxygen content in such waivered alcohol blends,even when the MTBE is present as a result of unintentional comminglingin the base gasoline and is under two percent. The Agency requests commentson this approach. With the oxygen concentrations of each blend consistently expressed onthe basis of their equivalent oxygen contents, overall compliance withthe program is measured against attainment of an ``equivalent oxygen contenttarget.'' This target is equal to the concentration of equivalent, or non-offset,oxygen required in all gasoline in order to provide the necessary CO reduction.Using this approach, the required 17.35 percent CO reduction that mustbe provided by the alternative fuels program translates into an equivalentoxygen content target of 2.57 percent. EPA, therefore, proposes 2.57 percentas the required level of equivalent oxygen. Demonstrating conformity with the 2.57 percent (or 2.79 percent if no TROis promulgated) will be a matter of weighting the individual equivalentoxygen content values by the volume of the respective fuels first introducedinto commerce within the control area during the prescribed period. Ifoxygen free fuel is allowed in the program, it would be similarly includedin the calculations as having an equivalent oxygen content of zero. Iftrading is allowed and equivalent ``oxygen credits'' are available, theywould also be accounted for in the calculations. The Agency's proposalin these areas is discussed later in this section. Comments are specifically requested on the feasibility of marketing suchfuels under the existing ASTM, federal, and Arizona limits, the appropriatenessof including a CO benefit offset for alcohol-containing gasoline such asthat described for ethanol blends, the feasibility and cost implicationsof supplying special volatility adjusted gasoline to the Phoenix area inorder to avoid the CO offset, and the likelihood that methanol blends willbe marketed in the Phoenix area. d. <T3>Effective Date. </T3>The Agency believes, and the Clean Air Act requires,that the oxygenated fuels program should be implemented on a schedule thatrepresents reasonable further progress towards attainment prior to fullattainment of the CO NAAQS in 1991. In practical terms, the program shouldstart on the earliest date that will not disrupt the supply of gasolineor cause unreasonable cost increases. The Agency's review of the most pertinentfactors in making this determination shows that the effective date forthe program is related to the leadtime required in three critical areas:Supplying the requisite gasoline and blending agents to the Phoenix terminalcomplex, terminal storage and handling, and final distribution of the variousblended fuels. Turning first to the issue of final distribution, no changes in tank trucksor associated equipment, which is used to deliver the fuel from the terminalcomplex to the service stations, should be required. Some modificationsto the service station equipment (e.g., storage tank cleaning and the installationof fuel filters) will be generally required for locations marketing alcoholblends. Such modifications are not regarded as requiring a significantamount of lead time to accomplish. As for the supply of the requisite fuel products, this issue involves theconsideration of both production and transportation. There currently appearsto be enough MTBE, a low-oxygen blending agent, either produced in theUnited States or available by importation to satisfy the Phoenix marketwithout significantly elevating its cost from current levels. The sameappears to be basically true for ethanol, a high-oxygen blending agent.[Reference 4] With regard to transportation or supply to the Phoenix area,MTBE is most likely to be transported via pipeline in final blended formin the gasoline shipped from the refineries in the Los Angeles area. TheSouthern Pacific Pipe Line, Inc. (SPPL), which owns and operates the pipeline,has stated there are no technical obstacles in handling MTBE blends withinits current capacity, due to the compatibility of these blends with normalgasoline. [Reference 5] (It is possible that MTBE blending may take placein Phoenix, although the extent of this event is currently uncertain.)Ethanol-based gasoline, on the other hand, will be blended in the Phoenixarea. The pure ethanol apparently will be shipped by railcar from productionfacilities outside the State. This rail capacity appears to already exist.[Reference 4] The oxygen- free gasoline required for blending can alsobe supplied by pipeline deliveries from California, even if the pipelineis also handling MTBE blends. As noted earlier, ethanol blends for thePhoenix market should be able to be made from present oxygen-free gasolinesupplies from the Los Angeles area pool. This is true now even with Arizona'sRVP limits on ethanol blends, because the gasoline now being deliveredto Phoenix appears to average about 1 psi below the Arizona limits. Itwill certainly be true if Arizona relaxes its RVP limit during the CO season.This is important due to the added cost and complexity otherwise associatedwith using a special, low RVP oxygen-free gasoline. (The possible effectof using such a fuel is described below.) Therefore, delivering the necessaryfuels and blending stock to the Phoenix terminal complex does not appearto be a critical issue.The last element of potential concern is storage and handling of the fuelsand blending agents within the Phoenix terminal itself. Here again, thecompatibility of MTBE blends and existing gasoline means that this typeof oxygenated blend could basically displace such gasoline without anysignificant changes to the terminal facilities. Dealing with ethanol blends, however, is a more complicated issue. Limitedrail service and ``off loading'' facilities exist, which can be used forthe pure ethanol, but may need expansion and improvement. A more substantialobstacle involves the practice of blending the gasoline and ethanol asthe fuel is loaded into the tank truck or actually in the tank truck. Thisrequires the segregated storage of the alcohol-free gasoline and the ethanol.The tankage can be made available by displacing other products within theterminal facility, or by building new storage facilities. The latter seemsmost likely, especially for the pure ethanol, given the volume of ethanolblends that may be used to comply with the proposed oxygenated fuels program.In fact, one ethanol company already appears to be following this approachin response to some of the program options being considered by the Arizonalegislature. [Reference 4] Also, the actual blending of gasoline and ethanolmay require special equipment. Therefore, the introduction of ethanol blends into the Phoenix area, atthe level which appears necessary, will at a minimum likely require newstorage and handling facilities in Phoenix. Such additionaI facilitieshave been estimated by SPPL to take about one year to complete. [Reference6] One year should also be technically adequate for various changes inequipment and operating procedures. Assuming this leadtime starting frompublication of the final rulemaking on August 10, 1988, as required bythe Court Order, EPA proposes that the oxygenated fuels program take effectOctober 1, 1989. The preceding discussion focused on technical requirements. While one year'sleadtime may technically permit compliance, it may limit refiners' optionsfor compliance relative to a longer period. It may also require costlychanges in refinery operations that could also be avoided. For example,with only one year's leadtime a Los Angeles refiner would likely not beable to construct new tankage to segregate Phoenix-bound MTBE blends orcomponents. This may require preemption of tankage now used for other purposesand may mean that a refiner cannot recover the octane value associatedwith the high MTBE content. Similarly, a refiner might have to forego recoveringthe octane value of its planned ethanol blending in Phoenix. Methanol blendsmay also be precluded, since reduced-RVP base stock would certainly needto be segregated. SPPL may also not be able to build new breakout tankagewhich would simplify and reduce the costs of simultaneously handling bothMTBE blends and oxygen free gasoline destined for ethanol blending. Toallow it to consider cost versus schedule tradeoffs and any unexpectedtechnical difficulties caused by an October 1, 1989 effective date, EPArequests comments on the need for and cost impact of providing greaterflexibility in establishing the effective date of the oxygenated fuelsprogram. This flexibility could be provided by delaying the actual effectivedate or gradually phasing-in the equivalent oxygen content specification.Comments should be specific to a refiner's own plans for compliance andits own current infrastructure for production, storage, transport, anddistribution of gasoline.e. <T3>Regulated Parties and Activities.</T3> Regulatory requirements wouldapply to all parties in the gasoline and oxygenate distribution networksin the Phoenix CO nonattainment area during the control season. Four typesof regulatory requirements are proposed: 1. <T3>Registration. </T3>All persons in the control area gasoline distributionnetwork would be required to submit a registration form to the Agency nolater than one month before the start of each control season. Parties subjectto the regulatory standard, as defined below, would be required to provideinformation on how they intend to comply with such standard. Other parties(e.g., most retailers) would have to submit generally less specific informationon their planned role in distributing, transporting, selling, or dispensingoxygenated fuel during the control season. In addition, persons sellingor supplying oxygenates (e.g., alcohols and ethers in pure, diluted, denatured,or additive- improved form) to be used within the control area would berequired to register. 2.<T3> Regulatory Standard. </T3>The 2.57 percent (2.79 percent if no tripreduction program is promulgated) equivalent oxygen content standard wouldapply to all persons who first introduce gasoline into commerce withinthe Phoenix CO nonattainment area. This would include persons who firstsell, supply, offer for sale, or offer for supply gasoline within sucharea (e.g., distributors). The standard would also apply to persons whoproduce gasoline (e.g., refiners) or who alter its quality and/or oxygencontent (e.g., alcohol blenders), and then; sell or supply such product,within the control area. Finally, the standard would apply to any personwho ``imports'' product into the control area for direct sale or supply(e.g., a party who transports or causes to be transported gasoline by truckfrom outside the control area to a retail station or wholesale purchaser-consumerwithin the area). 3. <T3>Reporting and Recordkeeping. </T3>All persons subject to the equivalentoxygen content standard would be required to submit monthly reports containinginformation on their compliance with the standard. Persons transportinggasoline into the control area (e.g., pipelines) and those selling or supplyingoxygenates within the control area would also be required to submit monthlyreports on such activities. Persons subject to reporting requirements wouldhave to maintain adequate records to support the information containedin their reports. Other persons in the control area gasoline distributionnetwork would be required to maintain specified records on their activitiesduring the control period and make them available for EPA review, but wouldnot be required to submit monthly reports. 4. <T3>Labelling. </T3>Retailers and wholesale purchaser-consumers (partiespurchasing gasoline in bulk for their own ultimate use) would be requiredto label pump stands from which gasoline is dispensed with the type ofoxygenate used in the gasoline and its oxygen content. Invoices and similardocuments which accompany the shipment of gasoline in the control areawould also have to be labelled. These regulatory requirements are discussed in more detail below. f. <T3>Registration.</T3> As noted above, all persons in the gasoline distributionnetwork in the control area would be required to register with EPA at leastone month prior to the starting date of each control season. Persons subjectto registration would include refiners, pipeline and terminal operators,distributors, resellers, carriers, retailers and wholesale purchaser-consumers.\4\<NOTE/> Such persons would have to supply basic information on theirfacilities and on their activities during the previous one-year period.Persons subject to registration but not subject to the equivalent oxygencontent standard (e.g., most retailers) would be required to submit informationon their plans regarding oxygenated fuel during the coming control season.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Persons adding oxygenates to gasoline for the first time(includng persons who mix oxygenated and non-oxygenated fuels that havealready been introduced into commerce as  gasoline by other hands) arealso required to register as fuel manufacturers under the regulations at40 CFR Part 79. Persons entering the gasoline distribution network duringa control season would have to register at least 15 days before startingoperations. Persons subject to the equivalent oxygen content standard would be requiredto provide information on how they intend to comply with the standard duringthe coming control season. Such parties would have two compliance options.Under the first option, each batch of gasoline sold, supplied, or offeredfor sale or supply during the control season would have to have a minimumequivalent oxygen content of 2.57 percent by weight. Under the second option,all gasoline sold or supplied during each monthly compliance period wouldbe required to have an average equivalent oxygen content of 2.57 percent.Monthly compliance periods would be on a calendar month basis. In meetingthis monthly average standard, regulated parties would be allowed to tradeequivalent oxygen credits during the monthly compliance period (as discussedmore fully below). Parties who elect the second compliance option would be required to submita statement indicating their agreement that any violation of the monthlyaverage standard would be treated as violations committed on each and everyday of the averaging period (e.g. if the monthly averaging period is December1 to December 31, a violation of the standard for this period constitutes31 days of violation). Parties selecting the second option would also haveto submit detailed information on their planned product mix during thecontrol period (e.g., 60 percent of product will contain 11 percent MTBEwith 2.0 percent oxygen content, 35 percent will contain 10 percent ethanolwith 3.7 percent actual oxygen content and 3.29 percent equivalent oxygencontent, 5 percent will not contain oxygenates) and on how any shortfallin meeting the average standard will be met through the purchase of equivalentoxygen credits or a change in product mix. It is the Agency's intent that generally only one party in the distributionnetwork would be responsible for compliance of any particular quantityof gasoline with the equivalent oxygen content standard. Problems may arise,however, where a second party alters the equivalent oxygen content of aquantity of gasoline first introduced into commerce within the controlarea by another party (e.g., a carrier adds ethanol to a truck load offinished gasoline purchased from a distributor). The Agency requests commentson the best means to prevent such ``double reporting''. Persons who intend to sell or supply oxygenates that are used within thecontrol area during the coming control season would also be required toregister with the Agency. They would be required to submit detailed informationon their planned activities within the control area, including locationof storage and dispensing facilities, type(s) of oxygenate(s) to be soldor supplied, and the names and addresses of known customers within thecontrol area. All parties will be required to revise their registration forms within15 days of a significant change in operations. Significant changes requiringa revision of registration would include any change in location or ownershipof a facility, commencing or ceasing use of a particular oxygenate, a significantchange in planned product mix or in use of equivalent oxygen credits, andother circumstances to be specified in the regulations. g. <T3>Equivalent Oxygen Content Determinations, Sampling and Testing. </T3>Underboth compliance options, it will be necessary to determine the equivalentoxygen content of gasoline subject to regulatory requirements. As discussedabove, the Agency will specify the equivalent oxygen content of variousoxygenated fuels (including an ``RVP penalty'' for ethanol). To measurecompliance, a representative sample of gasoline first will be tested forits oxygenate content (e.g. percent ethanol, percent MTBE). For partieschoosing the first compliance option (determined per batch without averagingor trading), the oxygenate content will be converted to equivalent oxygencontent and then compared to the regulatory standard. Compliance measurementand calculation procedures for the second compliance option are discussedin the next section of this notice. The sampling methodologies would be identical to those proposed for theAgency's gasoline volatility control program. <T3>See </T3>proposed 40 CFR Part 80 Appendix D, set forth at [52 FR 31318-30,August 19, 1987]. The methodologies are also essentially identical to thoseused by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) in its gasoline volatilitycontrol program (Cal. Admin. Code Tit. 13, R. 2261). The proposed methodologiesinclude the ASTM sampling methodologies for gasoline products and a servicestation nozzle sampling procedure developed by CARB. The ASTM methodologies would be used by the Agency in sampling gasolineand oxygenated fuels at facilities such as refineries, blending facilities,pipelines, bulk terminals, and bulk plants. These sampling procedures includebottle sampling, tap sampling, and manual line sampling. The nozzle samplingprocedure would be used at service stations and similar dispensing facilities(e.g., fleets). The Agency is also considering adoption of two alternative nozzle samplingtechniques: (1) Instead of placing the sample container in a chilling mediumwhile being filled and stored (as in the CARB procedures), the containerwould remain at ambient temperatures prior to pre-testing cooling; and(2) sampling would be done using certain EPA developed equipment and procedures.The August 19, 1987 notice of proposed rulemaking (52 FR 31274) for thegasoline volatility control program, which contains the specific proposedmethodologies and a detailed description of both the proposed and alternativesampling methodologies, has been placed in the rulemaking docket for thisFIP. <T3>h. Alternative Compliance Demonstration: Averaging and Trading. </T3>Asnoted above, persons subject to the equivalent oxygen content standardwould have the option of meeting this standard on a monthly average basisprovided certain registration requirements are met. Under this option,compliance would be based on a weighted average of the equivalent oxygencontent of all gasoline sold or supplied within the control area duringa monthly period. The following procedures are proposed for the determinationof such a monthly average: 1. The equivalent oxygen content (by weight) of each discrete quantityof gasoline in the possession of the regulated party (e.g., each storagetank at a bulk terminal) at the beginning of each compliance period wouldbe sampled and tested according to the procedures described in this notice.2. The equivalent oxygen content of gasoline would also be tested eachtime there is a change in its quantity and/or quality that would tend toaffect its oxygen content. This would require testing upon addition ofany quantity of gasoline to a storage tank, but not upon removal of productfor sale. It would also require testing upon the addition of any amountof oxygenate(s) to the gasoline.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The Agency requests comments on other changes to gasolinequantity or quality that should (or should not) trigger the testing requirement.3. The amount of gasoline sold or supplied within the control area betweenthe dates and times of equivalent oxygen content tests would be recorded.\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The Agency is considering a requirement that the oxygencontent of gasoline be known and provided to the purchaser (or person supplied)prior to sale or supply, and requests comments on such a requirement. Thiswould facilitate compliance with labelling and other regulatory requirements.4. At the end of the compliance period, the quantities of gasoline recordedper (3) above would be multiplied by the relevant equivalent oxygen content.The resulting ``total equivalent oxygen'' amounts would then be added togetherand divided by the total amount of gasoline sold or supplied during thecompliance period to determine the monthly average equivalent oxygen content.In the case of in-line or in-truck blending of oxygenates, the equivalentoxygen content of each discrete quantity of final blended product (e.g.,a truck load) would have to be determined and included in the monthly averagecalculations. Similarly, when gasoline is ``imported'' from outside thecontrol area for direct sale or supply (e.g., a tank truck load broughtfrom Los Angeles directly to a service station in Phoenix) the equivalentoxygen content of each such discrete quantity of product must be determinedand included in monthly average calculations. The following example illustrates how this averaging mechanism would work.Assume that Distributor A receives gasoline via pipeline from outside thePhoenix control area, stores the product in storage tanks at its Phoenixterminal, and sells the product to retail stations within the control area.On Day 1 of the compliance period Distributor A tests the equivalent oxygencontent of product in its storage tanks and finds the following results:Tank X (leaded regular)_2.9 percent; Tank Y (unleaded regular)_2.0 percent;and Tank Z (unleaded premium)_2.0 percent. Distributor A receives othershipments of product in each grade from the pipeline on Day 16 of the complianceperiod and tests each tank promptly with the following equivalent oxygencontent results: Tank X_3.0 percent; Tank Y_2.2 percent; and Tank Z_0 percent.No other shipments were received during the compliance period. Complianceis calculated as follows, using the gallonage of gasoline sold during relevantperiods: A.

In order to meet the standard of 2.57 percent,he would have to purchase (or otherwise obtain) equivalent oxygen creditsfrom another regulated party. Under the proposal, equivalent oxygen credits would be allowed to be soldor traded among regulated parties. Equivalent oxygen credits would be earnedby parties to the extent that the average equivalent oxygen content ofgasoline sold or supplied during a monthly compliance period exceeds 2.57percent. Equivalent oxygen credits could only be traded and used duringthe compliance period in which they are earned. Equivalent oxygen creditsare calculated by first computing the total equivalent oxygen content ofthe regulated party's monthly gallonage. The product of the party's monthlygallonage and 0.0257 (2.57 percent) is then subtracted from the party'smonthly total equivalent oxygen content, and the difference is the amountof equivalent oxygen credits available for sale or trade (if the differenceis zero or a negative number, the party has no equivalent oxygen creditsavailable for sale or trade). The trading mechanism is illustrated by the following example. Assume DistributorB complies with all sampling and testing requirements, and determines thatall gasoline sold or supplied during a monthly compliance period has auniform equivalent oxygen content of 3.29 percent. The amount of product sold/supplied during the compliance period is 200,000gallons. Distributor B's total equivalent oxygen content for this periodis 6580, determined by multiplying its gallonage (200,000) by its averageoxygen content (0.0329). In order to meet the 2.57 percent regulatory standard,its total equivalent oxygen content must be 5140 (200,000andmultiply;0.0257).Thus, Distributor B has 1440 oxygen credits (6580-5140) available for saleor trade during the compliance period. If 1210 of these equivalent oxygencredits were traded or sold by Distributor B to Distributor A in the aboveexample, Distributor A could then demonstrate compliance with the 2.57percent standard by adding these credits to the total equivalent oxygencontent of his product (4325) and dividing the sum (5535) by his gallonage(215,000), resulting in an average monthly equivalent oxygen content (withtrading) of 0.0257 (2.57 percent). i. <T3>Labelling. </T3>The proposed regulations would require the labellingof pumps from which gasoline is dispensed at retail outlets and wholesalepurchaser-consumer facilities during the control season. The pump labelwould have to include the type of oxygenate which is contained in the fuelbeing dispensed from that pump, as well as its actual oxygen content (byweight to the nearest 0.1 percent). Such labelling would allow consumersto know what type of oxygenate they are purchasing and provide them withflexibility in choosing a product most compatible with the operation oftheir vehicles. Labelling will also aid enforcement by allowing the Agencyto monitor whether parties are selling product in accordance with theirregistration statements. It could also provide a partial cross-check oncompliance with the regulatory standard, if adequate numbers of inspectionscan be carried out. The proposed regulations would also require that invoicesand other gasoline delivery documents be similarly labelled. Such documentswould have to be retained by regulated parties for at least two years andbe available for inspection by EPA personnel or contractors during thatperiod. j. <T3>Reporting and Recordkeeping. </T3>All persons subject to the oxygencontent standard would be required to submit monthly reports containingcompliance information. Reports would be due no later than 15 days afterthe close of each compliance period. Parties who have selected the optionof meeting the standard on a ``per batch'' basis would be required to submittest results and other information relevant to determining compliance (e.g.,gallonage introduced into commerce in the control area during the month,and type and quantity of purchased oxygenates). Parties who have selected the option of meeting the standard on a monthlyaverage basis (with or without trading) would be required to submit moredetailed information because of the greater complexities of determiningcompliance. Information to be submitted would include data on product receivedby the party (e.g., date, source, type, gallonage), test results, and sale/supplyof product by the party (e.g., date, type, gallonage, person to whom sold/supplied,and oxygen content). The party would also be required to calculate themonthly average equivalent oxygen content of its product based on suchinformation and according to the procedure outlined above. Parties engaged in trading equivalent oxygen credits during a monthly complianceperiod would be required to supply additional information in their monthlyreports. Such information would include the name and address of the otherparty in each trade and the quantity of equivalent oxygen credits traded.The party selling or otherwise transferring equivalent oxygen credits wouldhave to demonstrate how such credits were calculated. The party buyingor otherwise receiving equivalent oxygen credits would be required to calculateits compliance with the regulatory standard through the use of these credits.Both parties to an equivalent oxygen credit trade would have to submitsupporting documentation adequate to demonstrate the agreement of the otherparty to the trade and to transfer the credits during the compliance periodfor which the trade is reported (e.g., a contract signed by both partiesno later than the last day of the compliance period). EPA will not recognizea purported trade as valid unless both parties report and adequately documentit. As in the lead phasedown program, the requirement that credits be tradedby the end of the compliance period is based on the Agency's view of tradingas a planning tool rather than a means to cure violations. Comments onany special hardships this would create are requested. Only parties subjectto the monthly average compliance option would be allowed to trade equivalentoxygen credits. Persons who sold or supplied oxygenates for use within the control areaduring a compliance period would also be required to submit monthly reportsto the Agency. These reports would have to include information on the typeof oxygenate sold (e.g., ethanol), date of sale, and the party to whomsold. Such reports would provide a partial cross-check on reports submittedby regulated parties. Persons who transport gasoline into the control area but who are not subjectto the regulatory standard (e.g., pipelines) would also be required tosubmit monthly reports to the Agency. These reports would have to includeinformation on the type (e.g., unleaded regular) and gallonage of gasolinetransported during each compliance period, the party and location (andthe specific tank, if known) to which transported, and the type (and concentration,if known) of oxygenate(s) contained in the gasoline transported. Such reportswould provide a partial crosscheck on reports submitted by persons subjectto the regulatory standard. All parties subject to monthly reporting requirements would also be requiredto maintain adequate records (including oxygen content test results) tosupport the information contained in their reports. Such records wouldhave to be retained for at least a two-year period. For all reports, EPA would have the authority to determine whether anyreport should be recognized as meeting regulatory requirements. Other persons who must register (e.g., retailers who do not transport orcause to be transported gasoline from outside the control area) are notsubject to monthly reporting. However, as noted above, all parties in thegasoline distribution network would be required to retain (and make availablefor EPA inspection) invoices and other gasoline delivery documents fora two-year period. Comments are requested on the need for other recordkeepingrequirements for such parties. k. <T3>Violations and Defenses. </T3>The regulations will specify what constituteviolations of the regulatory requirements. Such violations are proposedto include: 1. Failure to submit a registration statement by the date due; 2. Failure to submit a revised registration statement (when required todo so) by the date due; 3. Submittal of an incomplete or incorrect initial or revised registrationstatement; 4. Failure to sample or test gasoline in accordance with prescribed regulatorymethodologies; 5. Failure to sample or test gasoline when required to do so;6. Selling, supplying, offering for sale, offering for supply or otherwisefirst introducing into commerce within the control area gasoline whoseoxygen content exceeds the regulatory standard after any allowable averagingand trading calculations (by a party subject to such standard); 7. Failure to properly label a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumerpump stand; 8. Failure to properly label an invoice or other gasoline delivery document;9. Failure to submit a required monthly report by the date due; 10. Submittal of an incomplete or incorrect monthly report; 11. Failure to maintain required records for the applicable time period;12. Transfer of equivalent oxygen credits which have not been created inaccordance with regulatory requirements; 13. Use of improperly created or transferred equivalent oxygen creditsto demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements; 14. Transfer of equivalent oxygen credits after the end of the monthlycompliance period in which they are created; and 15. Failure to comply with any other regulatory requirement. The Agency believes that the large majority of violations listed aboveare within the power of regulated parties to control and thus should notbe subject to specific regulatory defenses. The regulations do not providea defense for exceedances of the regulatory equivalent oxygen content standard,since the availability of monthly averaging and equivalent oxygen credittrading provides a great deal of flexibility to regulated parties in meetingthis standard.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Of course, the purported violator will have all of itstraditional defenses, including denial, to a claimed violation (e.g. itmight show that no violation occurred). Certain violations, however, may not be fully within the control of a regulatedparty. This group may include violations of pump and document labelingrequirements where a party has reason to believe fuel provided to him byanother party complies with the label. It may also include the use of transferredequivalent oxygen credits where the using party does not know (or couldnot reasonably be expected to know) that the credits were not lawfullygenerated. The Agency requests comments on what defenses (if any) shouldbe provided for these types of violations. 1. <T3>Federally Assumed Enforcement.</T3> Federal enforcement of air qualityimplementation plans generally commences with issuance of a notice of violation(NOV) to the violator and the state under section 113(a)(1) of the CleanAir Act. If the violation extends beyond the 30th day after the date ofthe NOV, EPA may issue a compliance order or bring a civil action undersection 113(b) of the Act. Section 113(b) provides for temporary or permanentinjunctive relief, or a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per day of violation,or both. The Act also provides for ``federally assumed enforcement.'' Section 113(a)(2)provides that whenever ``the Administrator finds that violations of anapplicable implementation plan are so widespread that such violations appearto result from a failure of the State in which the plan applies to enforcethe plan effectively, he shall so notify the State.'' If EPA finds thatsuch failure extends beyond the 30th day after notification, the Agencyis required to issue a public notice of such finding. Beginning with thedate of such public notice, EPA may issue compliance orders to, or bringcivil actions against, violators without prior issuance of individual NOV'sunder section 113(a)(1). The Agency is concerned that the requirements of section 113(a)(1) of theAct, in combination with proposed program design elements, may limit enforcementof the proposed federal oxygenated fuels program. The combination of aseasonal control program, a monthly averaging compliance demonstrationalternative, report submittal and processing times, and the requirementsthat individual NOV's be issued to violators and that violations extendbeyond the 30th day after NOV issuance before compliance orders can beissued or civil actions brought may mean that only violations which occurearly in the control season and extend beyond the 30th day after the NOV(and if the 30th day is also within the control season) would be subjectto effective enforcement action. In normal SIP enforcement EPA's enforcementauthority under section 113(a)(1) operates in conjunction with a stateenforcement program that generally is not subject to requirements concerningNOVs. However, in this case the state appears to have no authority to enforceEPA's oxygenated fuels program. Furthermore, the Agency believes that the conditions for ``federally assumedenforcement'' under section 113(a)(2) of the Act will in all likelihoodexist in the Maricopa area. EPA is not aware of any plans by the Stateof Arizona to enforce any FIP regulations nor is it apparent what legalauthority the State could use even if it wanted to do so. In the absenceof State enforcement the Agency anticipates that widespread violationsof the FIP provisions will occur, particularly if federal enforcement isbased only on the section 113(a)(1) individual NOV requirements. EPA therefore intends to carefully scrutinize compliance reports duringthe first few months of the oxygenated fuels program. If EPA sees violationsthat are so widespread as to appear to result from the absence of any stateenforcement program, it will promptly notify the state as required by section113(a)(2). If such violations are continuing 30 days later, EPA will givepublic notice that it is initiating a period of federally assumed enforcement.EPA will then enforce the requirements of the oxygenated fuels programdirectly against violators without prior issuance of NOVs (and hence withoutthe 30-day post-NOV waiting period) as provided by section 113(a)(2).  This period of federally assumed enforcement will continue until such timeas the state satisfies EPA that it will enforce the oxygenated fuels program.EPA does not anticipate that the state will be able to do this since itapparently has no authority to enforce a federal program that is not supportedby any state legislation. m. <T3>Minimum Oxygen Content (In Addition to Averaging/Trading Compliance).</T3>The Agency is concerned that it may be difficult to effectively enforcethe proposed oxygenated fuels standard under the averaging/trading compliancealternative. Although the Agency is proposing detailed registration, reportingand recordkeeping requirements, the program essentially relies on the honestreporting of regulated parties to assure compliance. While this is a concernin any self-reporting scheme, it is of particular concern because multiplesources of oxygenates do not provide an effective cross-check on reportssubmitted by regulated parties. In some cases, the sources of oxygenates(e.g., refineries for MTBE) may be part of the same corporate entity asregulated parties subject to the oxygenated fuels standard. EPA's experience with the lead phasedown program shows the types of problemsthat can occur in a self-reporting enforcement scheme. The lead phasedownstandard is based on quarterly averaging of lead use in gasoline by refinersand importers. From November 1982 through 1985 inter-refinery averagingof lead usage (trading of lead rights) was allowed. From 1985 through 1987the banking of lead rights (for use in later compliance periods) was allowed.Although a number of violations were self-reported in the lead phasedownprogram, recent audits of refiners and importers by EPA (and others) haveuncovered a significant number of unreported violations. Means of cheatingincluded overreporting of gasoline gallonage, misclassification of gasolineand gasoline blending stocks, and underreporting of lead usage. The lattertype of abuse occurred despite the availability of an effective crosscheckin the form of quarterly reports of lead shipments to refiners by the handfulof lead additive manufacturers in the country (who have no apparent incentiveto misreport). While such unreported violations can be detected in thelead phasedown program, it generally requires review of a very large quantityof paperwork by a number of EPA investigators. The trading and (particularly)banking components of the lead phasedown program made the job of compliancemonitoring much more complex while, at the same time inadvertently creatingadditional inducements to cheat. The Agency anticipates that some amount of cheating may occur under theproposed FIP regulation, albeit in the opposite direction from that underthe lead phasedown program (i.e., under- rather than overreporting gallonage,overreporting the use of oxygenates rather than underreporting the useof lead). Because of the lack of an effective cross-check like lead additivemanufacturer reports, the uncertainty as to whether enough resources willbe available to adequately conduct audits of regulated parties' records,and other potential enforcement problems, the Agency is considering asan adjunct to the averaging/trading alternative promulgation of a minimum``per sample'' oxygen content standard of 2.0 percent that would applyto all gasoline sold or supplied (or offered for sale or supply) in thePhoenix CO nonattainment area. If such a requirement were adopted, eachperson choosing to use the averaging/trading alternative to demonstratecompliance with the 2.57% equivalent oxygen content standard would haveto meet that standard on average as well as ensure that each batch of gasolinefirst introduced into commerce during the control period contains at least2% equivalent oxygen content. Such a requirement could be directly enforcedby the Agency at retail outlets, terminals, and other distribution pointsin the area without the need to audit records of regulated parties. Whilea minimum standard of 2.0 percent would preclude the sale of nonoxygenatedfuel, it would still allow regulated parties the choice of 5.4 percentethanol, 11 percent MTBE or any other allowable oxygenate with a 2 percentoxygen content as a means to comply. The Agency anticipates that if such a minimum standard is promulgated aspart of the final rulemaking, it will also promulgate a liability regulationvery similar to that proposed as part of the recent gasoline volatilityrulemaking, under which the location of the violation would determine thepresumptively liable parties and which would provide certain defenses forsuch parties. <T3>See </T3>proposed 40 CFR 80.28 (52 FR 31317-8 (August 19, 1987)). Comments are requested on such a minimum standard. n. <T3>Oxygenation Measurements.</T3> Three alcohol content laboratory testingmethods are proposed as a new Appendix B to 40 CFR Part 52, Subpart D.Under Method 1, gasoline samples are extracted with water prior to analysison a gas chromatograph (GC). The extraction eliminates hydrocarbon interferenceduring chromatography. A known quantity of isopropanol is added to thefuel prior to extraction to act as an internal standard. Results are calculatedand reported by data reduction software in the GC using peak area, retentiontimes and other data obtained during the run. Method 1 is not valid forMTBE determination, so if there is any possibility of MTBE in the fuel,Method 2 or 3 must be used. EPA is not aware of any interference causedby MTBE if Method 1 is used, so it proposes to allow use of Method 1 inany situation in which MTBE content is not relevant to the compliance determinationat issue. Method 2 is a direct GC injection technique utilizing a single column (30to 60 meter length) which is capable of resolving the individual alcoholswithout interference from hydrocarbon fuel components. Little sample handlingis necessary, resulting in potentially more accurate results. The GC runtime per sample is approximately 30 minutes, but it might be possible toreduce this time depending on running conditions. Method 3 is a two-column backflush method in which the sample is injectedand loaded onto a primary column. This column retains the alcohols butdoes not retain the lighter weight hydrocarbon fractions of the fuel. Afterthe lighter fractions are rinsed out of the primary column, the carriergas flow through the column is reversed, the alcohols and heavier hydrocarbonfractions are loaded onto a secondary column and are individually separatedfor analysis. This method may take approximately 20 minutes of GC run timeper sample, as opposed to four minutes for an indirect GC sample run time,and also requires careful carrier gas flow time switching. The specific procedures for Method 1 are set forth in detail in AppendixF of the proposed rule for volatility control of gasoline and alcohol blends,as published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 19, 1987 (52 FR 31340). Specific Method2 and 3 procedures have not been developed at this time but the Agencyhas placed in the rulemaking docket a copy of proposed ASTM   P-176 AppendicesX9 and X11: ``Proposed Test Method for Determination of Oxygenates in SparkIgnition Engine Fuel by Gas Chromatography''. It is expected that any finalAgency procedures adopting direct injection test methods will be similarto these proposed ASTM procedures, and comments are requested on the ASTMproposals.It should be noted that none of the above three methods may be valid foralcohols with greater than four carbon atoms. However, a fuel waiver wasrecently granted by EPA for the methanol- cosolvent blend Octamix, whichmay contain small amounts of alcohols above C<T2>4 </T2>(i.e., pentyl-, hexyl-, heptyl-, and octyl-alcohols). Sincesuch a fuel could be used to comply with fuel oxygen content requirements,comments are requested regarding possible suitable techniques for measurementof these higher alcohols (or the oxygen content thereof), along with theC<T2>1</T2>-C<T2>4 </T2>alcohols that would be present in such a fuel. Furthermore,comments are requested on the test-to-test repeatability and lab-to-labreproducibility of any of the above methods, including any methods suggestedfor measurement of the C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8 </T2>alcohols. Once the mass concentration of each oxygenate in the fuel has been determinedusing these methods or others approved at a later date, it is necessaryto calculate the equivalent oxygen content of the fuel as a whole. Thisrequires multiplying the oxygen content of each oxygenated component bythe concentration of that component in the fuel and summing these resultsfor all oxygenates present in the fuel to get the actual oxygen content.If ethanol and methanol are not present (above a trace level of about 0.1percent), the equivalent oxygen content equals the actual oxygen content.If ethanol and/or methanol are present, the ``ethanol'' (or alcohol) entriesin Table 4 are used to find the equivalent oxygen content that correspondsto the respective oxygen content. Values between the specific points listedin the Table are found by linear interpolation. (Mathematical equationsare used to make this conversion in the regulation accompanying this notice.)Table 5 shows the oxygen contents by mass of the most common oxygen containingcompounds that have either been approved in EPA waivers or are consideredsubstantially similar to gasoline at concentrations less than 2.0 percentoxygen. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,xls28,8 </C><T4>Table </T4>5._<T4>Oxygen Contents of Common Compounds in Gasoline </T4><H1>Molecular oxygenate </H1><H1>Oxygen mass formula </H1><H1>Fraction</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Methanol <D>CH</D><T2>4</T2>O <D>0.4993 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethanol <D>C</D><T2>2</T2>H<T2>6</T2>O <D>0.3473 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Propanols <D>C</D><T2>3</T2>H<T2>8</T2>O <D>0.2662 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Butanols <D>C</D><T2>4</T2>H<T2>10</T2>O <D>0.2158 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentanols or MTBE <D>C</D><T2>5</T2>H<T2>12</T2>O <D>0.1815 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexanols or TAME \1\ <D>C</D><T2>6</T2>H<T2>14</T2>O <D>0.1566 </D><F>\1\ TAME: Tertiary Amyl Methyl Ether.</F></ITAG></ITAG> As an example, suppose the GC analysis of a leaded gasoline sample findsan ethanol mass concentration of 9.85 percent and an MTBE mass concentrationof 1.10 percent. The fuel oxygen content would then be:<ITAG tagnum="26">Fuel Oxygen Content=(0.0985)(0.3473)+(0.0110)(0.1815) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Fuel Oxygen Content=0.0362 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Fuel Oxygen Content=3.62 mass percent oxygen</ITAG>From Table 4, the equivalent oxygen content is between 2.90 and 3.29 percent.Interpolation yields a final value of 3.21 percent. Potential Effect of Sun Waiver Request for 15 Percent MTBE As mentioned elsewhere in this notice, Sun Refining and Marketing Companyhas requested a waiver under section 211(f) for a blend of 15 percent MTBEwith unleaded gasoline (52 FR 11701, (April 8, 1988)). A waiver is notlegally required for such a blend with leaded gasoline. If the Agency doesnot act to approve or disapprove the waiver by the end of September 12,1988, the request will be automatically granted under section 211(f)(4).A blend of 15 percent MTBE by volume with gasoline has an oxygen contentof 2.7 percent. Therefore, if the Agency does not deny Sun's waiver, blendsof up to 15 percent MTBE could be used to comply with the proposed FIP'srequirement for 2.57 percent equivalent oxygen content.The court-ordered deadline for final promulgation of the FIP is August10, 1988. If the Sun request has not been granted (or deemed granted) whenEPA promulgates the FIP, the final FIP will not differ from the proposalin order to incorporate elements of the pending Sun request. Subsequentgranting of the Sun request would provide regulated parties additionalflexibility in complying with the FIP, however. If the Sun request is granted (or deemed granted) prior to final promulgationof the FIP, a new FIP alternative would arise, namely that the FIP requireall fuel introduced into commerce to contain 2.57 percent equivalent oxygen,without the opportunity for demonstrating compliance through monthly averagingand trading of oxygen credits and without the associated reporting requirements.It should be noted that EPA's proposed enforcement approach under the averaging/tradingsystem would already allow each party subject to the equivalent oxygencontent requirement, as proposed, to elect to comply on a ``per batch''basis. There would be some disadvantages of a uniform oxygen requirement, however,including the lack of public access to gasoline with levels of oxygen belowthe requisite level. Also, ethanol blenders would have no market for theirexcess oxygen credits. Compliance monitoring, however, would be significantlyenhanced, as fuel could be directly sampled at service stations and otherfacilities. EPA therefore, is considering the option of a ``per batch''approach as an alternative to averaging/trading if the Sun request is approvedbefore the FIP is promulgated (just as it proposes elsewhere in this noticeif further SIP controls reduce the required oxygen content to 2 percentor less). Similarly, if the FIP is promulgated before a waiver is issuedto Sun, the Agency would consider revising the FIP to rescind the averaging/tradingalternative. EPA requests comments on these alternatives. As with the proposed2 percent minimum oxygen content standard discussed above, if this alternativeis adopted, the Agency anticipates promulgation of a liability regulationvery similar to that described in the recent fuel volatility proposal (52FR 31274). Gasoline Volatility Control Not ProposedArizona statute requires all gasoline-type motor vehicle fuels to complywith the quality specifications in the American Society for Testing andMaterials (ASTM) document titled D439-83. Among these specifications isa schedule for Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), a measure of the tendency ofgasoline to evaporate at 100 degrees Fahrenheit (anddegrees;F). The ASTMRVP maximum for Arizona for the months of October through March are 10.0,11.5, 13.5, 13.5, 13.5, and 11.5 pounds per square inch (psi), respectively.Proposals have been advanced by several parties to require reductions inthese limits as a means to reduce CO emissions. EPA does not propose toinclude any such reductions in the FIP for Maricopa County, for reasonsexplained immediately below. As will be mentioned again further below,EPA also proposes not to grant any CO emission reduction credits for anyRVP reductions which may be adopted by Arizona and included in a subsequentSIP revision. EPA believes that it has been well demonstrated that gasoline RVP doesaffect vehicle CO emissions for some vehicles and under some conditions.Specifically, an RVP decrease from 11.5 psi to 9.0 psi has been shown bytests on over 500 vehicles to decrease the CO emissions of 1981-82 modelyear passenger cars by about 16 percent and of 1983 and newer cars by about22.0 percent when these cars are tested according to the official FederalTest Procedure (FTP) (<T3>See </T3>40 CFR Part 86 for a full description) for measuring vehicleemissions. A sample of nineteen pre-1981 model cars has shown a reductionof about 8 percent under similar testing. Awareness of these test resultsis what prompted the interest in RVP control in Arizona. During the FTP testing programs that produced the results quoted above,the vehicles were kept at room temperatures between 75 anddegrees;F and 80anddegrees;F, and the fuel in the vehicles was at about 86 anddegrees;F atthe time measurement of CO emissions began. EPA's decision not to propose RVP reductions in the FIP stems from thefact that these temperature conditions are not representative of all theambient conditions under which serious CO exceedances occur in MaricopaCounty. There have been far fewer vehicles tested for RVP effects on COat lower ambient temperatures, and the effects have been far less in magnitudethan the reductions observed at 75-80 anddegrees;F. Specifically, fifteen1983 and newer vehicles tested at 50 anddegrees;F showed a reduction of onlyabout 5 percent when tested at 9.0 psi RVP versus 11.7 psi. Twelve 1981to 1983 vehicles tested by Chevron at 43 anddegrees;F had CO emissions at9.0 psi RVP that were about 4 percent higher than at 12.0 psi. Scientifictheory is consistent with these observations of smaller CO reductions atthese cooler temperatures. In the October through March period, monthly average daily minimum temperaturesin Phoenix range between 37.6 anddegrees;F and 56.8 anddegrees;F, well belowthe 75-80 anddegrees;F temperature of the FTP. In December, January, andFebruary, even the average daily maximums are below 70 anddegrees;F, (66.4anddegrees;F, 64.8 anddegrees;F, and 69.3 anddegrees;F, respectively). Warmerdays than these averages do occur, and in fact the MAG CO Plan uses a warmday (daily high of 78 anddegrees;F) as its ``design day.'' However, CO exceedancesoccur on average days and on cooler than average days as well as on suchunusually warm days, and the FIP (or SIP) must provide for attainment onall days. Furthermore, while many of the CO exceedances in Phoenix occurin the evening and seem likely to be heavily influenced by emissions fromvehicles that are at temperatures similar to that day's high reading, exceedancesalso occur in the morning when temperatures are about 20 anddegrees;F cooler.In EPA's opinion, the CO reductions at the cooler temperatures that areimportant in Phoenix are too small and too uncertain to cause EPA to relyon RVP reductions in its proposed FIP, or to propose to approve emissionreduction credits for any RVP reductions in a SIP revision. EPA has notinvestigated in much depth the cost and practicability of RVP reductionsin Phoenix, and takes no position on these aspects at this time. While EPA is not proposing any RVP reductions for the FIP, EPA believesthat the concept merits further investigation and consideration as a latersupplement or substitute for other measures in the SIP and FIP. The CObenefits may be more significant than they may seem at first from the abovediscussion. For one thing, the exact distribution of temperature conditionsunder which CO violations occur has not been thoroughly documented. Also,Arizona's RVP limit of 13.5 psi in December, January, and February (andPhoenix's survey-determined average January RVP of about 12.5 psi) is higherthan the 11.7 psi test fuel used in the available 50 anddegrees;F tests andthe 12.0 psi test fuel used in the 43 anddegrees;F tests. At 75-80 anddegrees;Fand no doubt at cooler temperatures the CO response to RVP is non-linearand becomes stronger at higher RVP levels. A reduction from a startingpoint typical of Phoenix gasoline may yield larger reductions than observedin the testing done to date. EPA intends to continue to investigate theRVP, CO, and temperature relationship. Comment and additional test dataare invited. Finally, while EPA is not proposing to promulgate or grant emission reductioncredits for RVP reductions from current levels because of their uncertaineffects at cooler temperatures, EPA is concerned about the negative effectsof RVP increases. Some CO exceedances_the design exceedance in the MAGCO Plan in particular_occur during periods when the ambient temperatureis 75 anddegrees;F or higher, and any RVP increase will definitely causeCO emission increases during such exceedances. In fact, the RVP effecton CO theoretically should become even more adverse at temperatures about75 anddegrees;F; tests on four vehicles at 95 anddegrees;F confirm this. Asdiscussed above, EPA therefore proposes to account for and compensate forthe RVP increase which it expects will be a side effect of the oxygenatedfuels regulation that is included in the proposed FIP.Implementation of the Proposed Federal Oxygenated Fuels Program  EPA believes that the proposed federal oxygenated fuels program has beenstructured so that it may be implemented by EPA without interfering withany state or local regulatory activities. There may, however, be some duplicationof activity and the associated higher costs to industry and businesses.EPA requests comments on how federal, state, and local programs can becoordinated most efficiently, including whether and how implementationof the federal requirements might be delegated. The federal oxygenated fuels regulations will not prevent Arizona fromtesting for and enforcing compliance with its existing standards for fuelquality. In particular, Arizona's existing limits on the volatility ofgasoline, including ethanol blends, will not be overridden by the federalprogram. If Arizona adopts a State oxygenated fuels program which is noteffective enough to allow EPA to approve it as a complete replacement forthe federal program, Arizona may legally enforce it except to the extentthat it would physically preclude industry compliance with the federalrequirements. Such interference seems unlikely, at least for the Stateproposals under discussion at present. The oxygenated fuels program will require regulated businesses to submitplans and various reports to EPA. In the final FIP, EPA will provide aname and address for the submissions. C. Demonstration of Attainment of the Combined State and Federal PlansEPA's evaluation of the air quality modeling analysis in the <T3>MAG 1987 Carbon Monoxide Plan for the Maricopa County Area </T3>indicatesthat a 22.0 percent reduction in the 1991 baseline carbon monoxide emissionsis needed to demonstrate attainment of the 8-hour CO standard by December31, 1991. The State of Arizona submitted the MAG Plan as a revision tothe Maricopa County portion of the state implementation plan. As discussedearlier, EPA is approving emission reduction credits for nine measuresin the proposed SIP revision. Two of these measures will not be in placebefore 1992. The remaining seven measures will reduce the 1991 carbon monoxidebaseline inventory by a total of 3.9 percent by the end of 1991. The twofederal control measures that EPA is proposing for promulgation in thisnotice will reduce the 1991 baseline inventory by 1.8 percent from theEmployer Alternative Modes Incentives Program and by 17.35 percent fromthe Oxygenated Fuel Program (without the trip reduction program, all therequired emission reduction would be achieved with an oxygenated fuelsprogram). All measures being proposed for either approval or promulgationin today's notice are listed in Table 6.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>6._<T4>Proposed Control Measures and Emission Reductions in the AttainmentDemonstration for Maricopa County </T4><H1>Control measure </H1><H1>1991 Emission reduction \1\ (percent)</H1> State Plan: <ITAG tagnum="2">I/M Program_1987 Legislation <D>2.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Short-Range Transit Improvements <D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Expanded MAG Regional Ridesharing Program <D>0.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Increase Bicycle Usage <D>0.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Pedestrian Travel <D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Conversion of Buses to Alternative Fuels <D>0.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Alternative Work Hours <D>1.1 </D></ITAG>Federal Plan: <ITAG tagnum="2">Employer Alternative Modes Incentives Program <D>1.8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Oxygenated Fuel Program <D>\2\ 17.35</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D>22.0 </D><F>\1\ As a percent of the 1991 Baseline. </F><F>\2\ Without the trip reduction program, the oxygenated fuels programwould achieve all the required reduction needed in addition to the statemeasures to attain in 1991.</F></ITAG> The proposed oxygenated fuels program with a scheduled start date of October1989, will provide emission reductions in the 1989-90 and 1990-91 winterCO seasons. Likewise, the trip reduction program with a start date in late1989 will provide emissions during those seasons. By the end of 1991, thetotal control strategy including both SIP and FIP measures provides a carbonmonoxide reduction from the 1991 baseline of 22.0 percent. This emissionreduction is sufficient to demonstrate attainment of the carbon monoxidestandard in Maricopa County by December 31, 1991, and Reasonable FurtherProgress in each year until the end of 1991. EPA's evaluation of the MAG Plan indicated that an emission reduction of7.8 percent in the 1995 baseline emissions will be sufficient to show attainmentof the 8-hour CO standard in 1995. The control measures in the MAG Planbeing proposed for approval today would achieve a 4.3 percent reductionin 1995. EPA's proposed Employer Alternative Modes Incentives Program willachieve at least 2.1 percent in 1995 and the proposed Oxygenated FuelsProgram will achieve 16.4 percent in the same year. The combined emissionreduction from all of these control measures is estimated to be 21.0 percentin 1995. This emission reduction is more than sufficient to show continuedattainment of the CO standard through 1995. If a motor vehicle oxygenatedfuels program with a higher oxygen requirement (2.79 percent) is promulgated,the emission reduction will be 21.3 percent in 1995, more than enough toshow continued attainment of the CO standard through 1995. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Effect on Proposal of Any Future SIP Submitted by Arizona </ITAG>A. Overall Approach to Revising the FIP It is possible that Arizona may adopt and submit as SIP revisions additionalCO control measures prior to final promulgation by EPA of the FIP measuresproposed above. If additional controls are submitted and if EPA determinesthat they are approvable for CO emission reduction credit, EPA will modifythe final FIP from today's proposal. The purpose of the modifications willbe to rely as much as possible on state controls rather than federal, andto provide via the FIP only as much control as needed to satisfy the 1991attainment target. If a legally enforceable trip reduction ordinance is adopted by the State,County, or local governments which is substantially equivalent to the MAGmodel ordinance and the proposed federal trip reduction regulation, andcovers all or virtually all employers of more than 100 persons in the COnonattainment area, EPA will not finalize its own trip reduction regulation.Any minor difference in the anticipated CO emission reductions from theFIP and SIP versions will be accommodated by adjusting the required average``equivalent oxygen'' content in the oxygenated fuels regulation.If creditable CO controls in addition to a TRO are approved as a SIP revision,but not including a State fuels program, EPA will lower the average ``equivalentoxygen'' requirement from the 2.57 percent level proposed today, so thatoverall only a 22.0 percent reduction in 1991 is provided by the combinationof the SIP and FIP measures. For example, if no local TRO is submittedbut legislation for loaded I/M testing is passed and signed, and assumingEPA decides to promulgate the proposed federal TRO, EPA would either lowerthe oxygen requirement to 2.33 percent or drop the TRO requirement, basedon the evaluation of the benefits of loaded I/M proposed below for publiccomment. Generally, each additional percentage point of CO reduction fromother measures will reduce the average oxygen requirement by 0.065 percentagepoints. If the oxygen requirement is reduced to 2.0 percent through thisprocess, EPA proposes to use any further new SIP control credit to reducethe coverage or severity of the federal trip reduction regulation, ratherthan to set an oxygen content less than 2 percent. If additional SIP controls are large enough to allow the average oxygenrequirements to be reduced to 2.0 percent or less, much of the rationalefor an averaging program_to achieve a level above 2.0 percent without prohibitingall sales of MTBE blends of 11 percent or less_would disappear. A simplerequirement that all gasoline meet the appropriate percent oxygen levelwould suffice to meet both air quality and consumer choice goals, withoutthe administrative burden to EPA of supervising an averaging program andwith more certainty of effective enforcement. It would, however, preventsales of oxygen-free gasoline during the mandate period, and it would reducethe financial incentive for ethanol blending due to the elimination ofsalable oxygen credits. EPA proposes this ``per batch'' approach as analternative to averaging and trading in the situation described, and requestscomments on which approach it should follow. A final possibility is that Arizona will adopt its own oxygenated fuelsprogram and submit it as a SIP revision. If it does, EPA will assign itcredit in the FIP final rule, or other subsequent rulemaking, using themethods and assumptions described elsewhere in this notice. If the revisedSIP achieves 22.0 percent or more, and EPA approves it, EPA will not promulgateany FIP. If the revised SIP does not provide enough CO reduction to makea federal oxygenated fuels program unnecessary but does contain some Stateoxygenated fuels program, EPA will face a potentially complex issue. EPArequests comment on whether it legally can and should set aside the inadequateState fuels program (for example by making a finding that it is pre-emptedunder section 211(c)(4) and not necessary for attainment given EPA's ownprogram), whether the two programs should operate simultaneously exceptwhen the State program would prohibit compliance with the FIP, or whetherand how EPA could fashion its program around the State's so that the requiredCO reduction is met with least conflict and duplication (for example, EPAmight require one grade to have a higher ``per batch'' oxygen level thanin the State's program). B. Measures Under State/Local Consideration The Arizona State Legislature has under consideration a number of billswhich contain a variety of carbon monoxide control measures.

Inspection and Maintenance Program Changes </ITAG>Loaded-Mode Inspectionand Maintenance Testing H.B. 2014 has been introduced in the Arizona House of Representatives.A provision of this bill would require that, effective January 1, 1989,vehicles subject to the inspection and maintenance (I/M) program be testedin the loaded condition, as well as in the idle mode, to determine pass/failstatus. Loaded-mode testing is not practiced in any other I/M program inthe United States. EPA believes, however, that sufficient research hasbeen done to indicate that loaded mode testing will be workable and effectivefor 1981 and newer model year vehicles. MOBILE 3, EPA's emission factormodel, has standard emission credits for loaded-mode testing for 1981 andnewer passenger vehicles and 1984 and newer light duty trucks. With respectto loaded-mode testing for older vehicles, uncertainties remain as to howmany more vehicles would fail the test, what kinds of repairs they wouldneed, and whether the current cost limits would allow those repairs tobe performed. If the Arizona legislature adopts the loaded-mode test requirement,EPA may go directly to final approval at the MOBILE 3 level of credit (i.e.for 1981 and newer model year vehicles). This revision to the Arizona I/Mprogram will achieve a 3.7 percent CO emission reduction. EPA will likelyrepropose emission credits for older vehicles in a separate rulemakingafter the State specifies certain parameters for the older vehicles suchas loaded cutpoints, failure rate targets and waiver targets. Boundary Expansion Two bills, S.B. 1176 and S.B. 1390, have been introduced in the ArizonaSenate. Each bill would expand the I/M program coverage area from the nonattainmentportion of Maricopa County to the entire County, making a greater numberof vehicles subject to the program. Should this revision be adopted bythe legislature, EPA would propose approval in a separate rulemaking afterevaluating the State's estimate of the benefit to be obtained from theexpansion. Repair Cost Limit Increase H.B. 2014 and S.B. 1390 would increase the repair cost limit to obtaina waiver from $50 to $100 for vehicles manufactured in or before the 1974model year. This change would result in more vehicles in this age categorybeing repaired to standard. Since older vehicles generally make a smallercontribution to the total vehicle miles traveled (VMT), however, the emissionbenefit of this change would be small. EPA would propose approval in aseparate rulemaking after evaluating the estimate the State submits ofthe emission benefit to be obtained, should this revision to the I/M programbe adopted.Model Year Expansion S.B. 1176 would increase the number of vehicles subject to the I/M programby removing the exemption for vehicles manufactured in or before the 1966model year. The benefit obtained from adding these vehicles to the programis likely to be small, because vehicles of this vintage make a small contributionto the overall VMT. If adopted, EPA would propose approval in a separaterulemaking after reviewing the evaluation that the State submits of theemission reduction to be achieved by this revision. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Alternative Fuel </ITAG>EPA would prefer that Arizona adopt and implement an oxygenated fuels programitself, rather than EPA carry this FIP proposal to completion. EPA is thereforepleased that the Arizona Legislature is actively considering new legislation.In order to lay the procedural foundation for EPA to take action on anynew legislation with as little delay as possible, EPA here proposes themethod and assumptions that it will use in approving or disapproving newlegislation and in assigning CO emission reduction credit to it. Unlessthe final legislation raises issues that are not adequately noticed forpublic comment in the following discussion, EPA intends to take actionwithout further proposal and opportunity for public comment. If an additionalproposal is essential, the proposed FIP may be finalized on schedule ratherthan delayed, but EPA would then continue the rulemaking process on theSIP and if appropriate rescind the FIP if and when it approves the SIP.EPA requests comment on this proposed approach and on all of the followingmethods and assumptions: a. The bills containing mandates for oxygenated fuels (H.B. 2014 and S.B.1174, 1386, 1388, and 1348) are all in principle eligible for CO reductioncredits. The bills which would create tax incentives for use of oxygenatedfuels (S.B. 1385 and 1453) are not eligible due to uncertainty about howthey would affect sales of each type of oxygenated fuel. b. The basis for calculation of CO emission reductions will be the EPAreport ``Guidance on Estimating Motor Vehicle Emission Reductions Fromthe Use of Alternative Fuels and Fuel Blends,'' January 29, 1988, EPA-AA-TSS-PA-87-4.The guidance in this report must be supplemented with some additional informationand assumptions to address all of the features of the Arizona bills. Theseadditional items are listed below.c. Unleaded gasoline sales in the Maricopa CO nonattainment area are andwill be assumed to continue to be split 76 percent regular and 24 percentpremium, for attainment demonstration purposes. d. If the final legislation mandates different oxygen levels for specificgrades, EPA will calculate the overall CO reduction by assuming that catalystvehicles and other vehicles labeled for unleaded fuel only will use unleadedregular and unleaded premium at the 76/24 split. Vehicles designed forleaded fuel will be assumed to use mostly leaded fuel, but 8.4 percentof pre-1975 passenger cars and light-duty trucks under 6,000 pounds grossvehicle weight rating (GVWR), 8.4 percent of pre-1979 light-duty trucksover 6,000 pounds GVWR, and 27.6 percent of later model leaded fuel carsand trucks (of which there are few) will be assumed to voluntarily useunleaded fuel at the 76/24 split. The 8.4 percent and 27.6 percent figurescome from an EPA Report ``Size Specific Total Particulate Emission Factorsfor Mobile Sources,'' which will also be the source for the productionshare of unleaded and leaded fuel vehicles by model year. [Reference 7]e. If the final legislation mandates one unspecified grade of high oxygenfuel (e.g., 3.4-3.7 percent) and allows the other grades to have a loweroxygen content (e.g., 1.9 percent), EPA will assume that the high oxygengrade is unleaded regular for all fuel suppliers. If two unspecified gradesmust be high oxygen, EPA will assume that these are leaded and unleadedregular. f. EPA will assume no switching between the three grades of gasoline dueto changes in relative price or consumer desire to use or avoid one typeor level of oxygenate. g. For any grade for which the minimum oxygen content is 1.9 percent, EPAwill assume that all (except as described immediately below) fuel soldof that grade is on average 11 percent MTBE (2 percent oxygen). For anygrade with a minimum of 1.8 percent, the fuel will be assumed to be 10.45percent MTBE (1.9 percent oxygen). If the Sun Refining and Marketing Company'srequest for a waiver for 15 percent MTBE (53 FR 11701 (April 8, 1988))is not approved, any grade with a minimum oxygen content above 2.0 percentwill be assumed to be met by the concentration of ethanol that provides0.1 percent more oxygen than the minimum specification not to exceed 10percent ethanol (3.7 percent oxygen). If the Sun request is granted, thisassumption will apply above 2.7 percent, but between 2.0 percent and 2.7percent EPA will assume that MTBE is used with a 0.1 percent oxygen safetymargin. These assumptions rely on the premise that Arizona will not allowan enforcement tolerance for oxygen content, so that refiners must blendto a slightly higher oxygen level by their measurements to allow for measurementvariability.  If a SIP submittal indicates an intent to allow an enforcement toleranceor is not specific on this question, EPA will assume that average actualoxygen content is exactly equal to the minimum requirement. Comments arerequested on both approaches. h. The exceptions to Assumption (g) immediately above concern possiblesale of 10 percent ethanol blends in a grade for which the oxygen contentrequirement is only 2.0 percent or less. If a major oil company, othersizable gasoline marketer, or other investor indicates in comments thatit will purchase and import via pipeline from California oxygen-free gasolineof that grade and offer it for resale to distributors for use in ethanolblending, EPA will assume that 5-10 percent of sales of that grade willbe gasohol (10 percent ethanol, 3.7 percent oxygen). The 5-10 percent rangereflects the market share gasohol being achieved in states that do notoffer State tax subsidies, mostly due to the action of independent marketers.EPA will select a value within this range based on all available commentsand information. Also, if a major oil company indicates that it will itselfsell an ethanol blend at its branded stations, that information will beused to determine market share also. i. If the final legislation creates a system of oxygen credit averagingabove 2.0 percent actual oxygen, but without the adjustment feature forethanol blends which appears in EPA's own FIP proposal, EPA will assumethat the gasoline industry will overall supply a product slate that inthe aggregate requires the  least purchase of ethanol but meets the averageoxygen requirement. This implies that all ethanol blends will have 10 percentethanol and that the industry will maintain an oxygenate sales mix of ethanolblends and MTBE blends that just meets the average oxygen requirement.EPA requests comment on whether any marketers would, on the contrary, sellethanol blends below 10 percent. The effect of any sales of ethanol blendsbelow 10 percent concentration, e.g., 6.7 percent ethanol blend to meeta 2.5 percent oxygen content requirement, would be to reduce the overallCO reduction achieved by a given actual oxygen content requirement, dueto the RVP CO penalty being incurred for more gallons of fuel. j. The bills now before the Arizona legislature allow ethanol blends tohave a higher RVP than other gasoline. Ethanol blends will be assumed tosuffer an average RVP increase of 0.76 psi and the associated CO penaltydescribed above in the FIP proposal, even if the final legislation doesnot provide them such a margin on RVP. However, if ethanol blends are effectivelyconstrained to be no higher in RVP than 1 psi less than the current ASTMlimits for Arizona by month, no CO penalty will be assumed. For example,the current ASTM (and Arizona) RVP limit in January is 13.5 psi, but theaverage RVP of the fuel sold is about 12.5 psi. If new legislation setsa limit of 12.5 psi or less for ethanol blends for January (or if it exemptsthem from any RVP limit if made from gasoline which cannot exceed 11.5psi), no CO penalty will be assumed for ethanol blends relative to theiroxygen content. k. General reductions in RVP limits will not be given CO emission reductioncredit, beyond the possible exclusion of the ethanol RVP/CO penalty thatwould otherwise apply as just described. l. Any averaging period of one month or less will be assumed to yield equaloxygen levels and CO reductions on all days. An averaging period of threemonths would be acceptable only if the oxygen content requirement appliesyear round. EPA's rationale for this proposal is that in a program witha mandate period of only about six months there may be significant start-uptransients in fuel composition and monthly averaging is needed to controlthese transients. In an annual program fuel composition should stabilizeand quarterly averaging should be adequate. EPA does not recommend a fullyear mandate for oxygenated fuels. m. The CO season in which control is needed will be taken to be October15 through March 31. Retail service station storage tanks will be assumedto require two weeks to ``turn over.'' Thus, service stations' in-tankinventories and sales must either be required to comply with the oxygencontent program as of October 15 of each year or all new deliveries startingOctober 1 must comply. All program requirements must apply through March31. n. The effective dates of the program must not allow unnecessary delayin implementation. o. The SIP must contain a commitment and resources for enforcement. Table 8 presents estimates of the CO emission reduction credits that wouldbe granted to each of the bills under these assumptions. The range of reductionsis 12.8 percent to 20.5 percent.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>8._<T4>Proposed CO Emission Reduction Credits for 1991 Attainment for OxygenatedFuels Bills Now Under Consideration by the Arizona Legislature</T4><H1>Bill</H1><H1>CO reduction</H1><H2>No declared plan to facilitate ethanol blending (percent)</H2><H2>With a declared plan to facilitate ethanol blending \1\</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">H.B. 2014 (original)<D> 12.8</D><D> 13.3-13.7 pct. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">S.B. 1174 (original)<D> 13.5</D><D> 13.9-14.4 pct. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">S.B. 1386 (original)<D> 20.7</D><D> Not applicable. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">S.B. 1386 (as amended in Health and Welfare Committee)<D>22.3</D><D>  Do. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">S.B. 1388 (original)<D> 18.6</D><D>  Do. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">S.B. 1348 (original)<D> 12.8</D><D> 13.3-13.7 pct. </D><F>\1\ The reductions shown in this column assume that 5-10 percent ofgasoline sales are 10 percent ethanol blends despite the requirement beingonly for 1.8 percent or 1.9 percent oxygen.

Trip Reduction Ordinances </ITAG>The Maricopa Association of Governments has developed a draft model tripreduction ordinance. If adopted by the MAG jurisdictions, the TRO wouldrequire employers with more than 100 employees at a worksite to reducesingle-occupant commute trips by 10% within two years. A further discussionof the model is in the Employer Alternative Modes Incentives Program section(section V.B.1.) of this notice. In March of this year, the MAG RegionalCouncil tabled approval of the model TRO until after a transit fundingelection tentatively scheduled for the spring of l989. The cities, towns,and the County of Maricopa will not consider individual adoption of theTRO until the MAG Regional Council approves it. Should the Regional Council decide to approve the model TRO and the localjurisdictions adopt it prior to final promulgation of the FIP, EPA proposesto grant a carbon monoxide emission reduction credit of 1.8% to the measure.Further, because the model TRO is similar to and would achieve the sameemission reduction as the trip reduction regulation being proposed by EPAtoday, the Agency proposes to substitute the locally-adopted TRO for thefederal trip reduction regulation. If local jurisdictions adopt the modelTRO after final promulgation, EPA would propose to amend the FIP eitherto eliminate unnecessary federal measures or reduce the severity of thosemeasures. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Other Measures </ITAG>Winter Daylight Savings Time and/or AlternativeWork Hours During the fall and winter months, the Maricopa region experiences eveningtemperature inversions. These temperature inversions reduce the normalupward mixing of the atmosphere thereby reducing the dispersion of pollutantsand exacerbating CO ambient concentrations. These inversions generallybegin to form at sunset which is also the peak commute period during thewinter. Measures like winter daylight savings time (shifting the time backone hour) or alternative work hours that move the commute period to a timebefore the onset of the inversion may reduce ambient carbon monoxide levels.In its omnibus 1987 air quality legislation (S.B. 1360), the Arizona StateLegislature requested the Department of Health Services (DHS) to studythe impact on air quality of winter daylight savings time and alternativework hours. The report on this study, which was prepared by the Departmentof Environmental Quality for DHS, was delivered to the Legislature on April1, 1988. EPA's preliminary review of that report shows that both winterdaylight savings time and alternative work hours can reduce the severityof evening-time CO violations and the number of total violations. The reportalso indicates that both programs can increase the severity of morning-timeviolations and increase carbon monoxide emissions. It should be noted thatthe majority of violations of the CO standard in Maricopa occur duringthe evening. Because winter daylight savings does not reduce CO emissions, EPA is unsureat this time how such a program would be credited as part of an attainmentdemonstration. EPA requests comments on whether such a program should becredited and on methods to credit it. As discussed earlier in this notice,EPA is proposing to credit the current alternative work hour program inArizona with a 1.1% emission reduction. In addition to shifting commutetrips to periods before the onset of the evening inversion, alternativework hour programs can reduce emissions by reducing traffic congestionduring the commute period. EPA requests comments on methods to credit additionalalternative work hour programs in the Arizona SIP. Voluntary No Drive Day Program During the 1987/88 winter season, the Maricopa Regional TransportationAuthority and the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce jointly conducted a voluntaryno drive day program. The ``Don't Drive One Day in Five'' program requestedcommuters to use alternatives to their single-occupant vehicle one dayper week in order to improve air quality. Behavioral and VMT studies madeduring the program indicated that some change in commute habits were occurring.In its CO Plan, MAG took substantial emission reduction credit for thismeasure. In reviewing the program to determine if credit should be given,EPA was concerned about the institutional features and future funding ofthe program and decided that it should not grant emission reductions forthe measure until the State made changes to the program. EPA's concernsare discussed in more detail earlier in this notice. Should the State make the necessary changes to the program, EPA would needto evaluate the program's performance before determining an appropriatereduction credit. At that time, EPA would propose modifications to theFIP to account for the new reductions from the SIP. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Proposed Findings Under Section 211(c)(4)(C) </ITAG>As noted above, EPA proposes to promulgate an oxygenated fuels requirementapplicable to portions of Maricopa County. EPA also proposes to approveas part of the Maricopa CO SIP the oxygenated fuel provisions of any legislationwhich substantially resembles H.B. 2014, S.B. 1174, S.B. 1386, S.B. 1388,or S.B. 1348 if signed by the Governor and submitted as a SIP revision,and to grant CO emission reduction credit towards the attainment targetaccording to the method and assumptions stated above. One question ariseswhether EPA must make the finding described in section 211(c)(4)(C) ofthe Clean Air Act prior to promulgating the proposed FIP program on oxygenatedfuels and/or prior to any approval of new legislation as part of the MaricopaSIP. For the reasons discussed below, EPA believes that such a finding is notrequired before EPA can promulgate the proposed FIP or approve a new SIPrevision with legislation on Reid Vapor Pressure limits and/or oxygen content.Assuming, however, that a section 211(c)(4)(C) finding is required, EPAproposes today to make such findings as to provisions concerning oxygencontent. With respect to the FIP, the proposed finding is simply that thespecific proposed oxygenated fuel regulations are ``necessary'' under themeaning of section 211(c)(4)(C). The proposal with respect to new Statelegislation is made with certain limitations, and does not include allprovisions of all of the bills now before the Arizona legislature. Theproposal covers only an oxygenated fuels program, and only within the boundsdescribed below. The proposed finding does not cover new State limits onReid Vapor Pressure. Section 211(c)(4)(A) states:<ITAG tagnum="21">Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B) or (C), no State(or political subdivision thereof) may prescribe or attempt to enforce,for the purposes of motor vehicle emission control, any control or prohibitionrespecting use of a fuel or fuel additive in a motor vehicle or motor vehicleengine_(i) if the Administrator has found that no control or prohibitionunder paragraph (1) is necessary and has published his finding in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, or (ii) if the Administrator has prescribedunder paragraph (1) a control prohibition applicable to such fuel or fueladditive, unless (the) State prohibition or control is identical to theprohibition or control prescribed by the Administrator.</ITAG>Section 211(c)(4)(C) states:<ITAG tagnum="21">A State may prescribe and enforce, for purposes of motor vehicle emissioncontrol, a control or prohibition respecting the use of a fuel or fueladditive in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine if an applicable implementationplan for such State under section 110 so provides. The Administrator  mayapprove such provision in an implementation plan, or promulgate an implementationplan containing such a provision, only if he finds that the State controlor prohibition is necessary to achieve the national primary or secondaryambient air quality standard which the plan implements.</ITAG>In the ANPRM for this FIP action (52 FR 45468, November 30, 1987) EPA indicatedthat section 211(c)(4) would allow the Administrator to promulgate an implementationplan containing a fuel-related control only if he makes this finding ofnecessity. After further consideration, EPA believes that this findingis required only when EPA promulgates a plan containing a State adoptedfuel-related control, not when EPA promulgates a federal fuel-related control.This construction comes directly from a literal reading of the statutorylanguage. Section 211(c)(4)(C) states first that a State may prescribea fuel-related control in certain circumstances, and then provides thatthe Administrator may promulgate an implementation plan containing ``sucha provision,'' referring to the State prescribed fuel-related control mentionedabove, only if he first finds that ``the state control or prohibition''is necessary to achieve the NAAQS. Thus, by the express terms of the statute,this provision applies only to State-adopted fuel control measures andnot to fuel-related controls promulgated directly by the Administrator.This construction of section 211(c)(4)(C) is also consistent with the purposesof section 211(c)(4) as a whole. In drafting the section Congress was apparentlyconcerned that where EPA had adopted (or expressly decided not to adopt)generally applicable fuel-related controls, conflicting State fuel controlsshould not be added to implementation plans unless necessary to achievethe NAAQS. Where EPA promulgates a federal fuel control as part of an implementationplan, however, this concern about conflicting controls from various jurisdictionswould not arise, even if EPA had previously promulgated other types ofgenerally applicable fuel-related control. Although EPA generally tends to discuss a section 110(c) FIP in terms ofonly those gap-filling provisions EPA promulgates itself, it is apparentthat Congress in this case thought of the FIP as the full complement ofmeasures applicable to an area, including any State measures EPA approvesfor the area. This semantic difference does not in any way affect the legalconstruction of this provision. Although EPA believes this interpretation of section 211(c)(4)(C) is thebetter reading, another reading of the section is possible that would requireEPA to make a finding that any fuel-related control, even one promulgateddirectly by the Administrator, was necessary to achieve the NAAQS if EPAhad previously pre-empted the area by adopting certain types of generallyapplicable fuel-related controls. Under the latter statutory interpretation(which EPA does not believe is correct) and in case EPA decides to approvenew legislation in Arizona, the threshold question is whether EPA has pre-emptedsuch a measure in either of the two ways described in section 211(c)(4).The Agency wants to stress that it does not believe that either form ofpre-emption has occurred in this case. First, EPA has not made the finding, described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph(A), that no fuel control or prohibition under paragraph (1) of section211(c) is necessary; and clearly has not published any such findings inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Second, EPA does not believe that it has prescribed the type of fuel controlcontemplated in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (A). EPA believes subparagraph(ii)'s reference to ``a control or prohibition applicable to such fuelor fuel additive'' was intended to include only the same type of fuel controlthat the regulation in question is attempting to prescribe. Under thisapproach, section 211(c)(4)(A)'s prohibition of the adoption of a particulartype of fuel control would be triggered only if EPA had already prescribed,by regulation under section 211(c)(1), the same type of fuel control asat issue in the case at hand_in this case, controls on Reid Vapor Pressure(RVP) and/or the oxygen content of fuels. Since EPA has not prescribedany control on the RVP or oxygen content of any fuel by section 211(c)rulemaking,\8\<NOTE/> the Agency believes that the pre-emption described in subparagraph(ii) has not yet occurred and that Arizona is free to adopt its own RVPand/or oxygen content control, and EPA is free to approve a SIP which includesthem without making the special finding described in section 211(c)(4)(C).For the same reasons, EPA also believes it may promulgate oxygen contentcontrols of its own without this finding even if section 211(c)(4)(C) appliesto Federally promulgated fuel-related controls. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ EPA has established limits on oxygen content for certainnew fuels that have been granted waivers under section 211(f) of the Actfor introduction into commerce, but has taken no such action under section211(c). Even if preemption has occurred,\9\<NOTE/> however, EPA believes that it may still promulgate the proposedFIP controls and approve certain types of State provisions for limits onoxygen content because the Agency can make the finding under section 211(c)(4)(C),which would authorize promulgation/approval and, thus, eliminate the preemptionproblem. As set forth above, section 211(c)(4)(C) authorizes EPA to promulgate/approveinto the SIP a State-adopted fuel control measure that has otherwise beenpre-empted by EPA action if EPA finds that the State control ``is necessaryto achieve the standard'' that the SIP implements. EPA interprets thislanguage to require the Agency to find that the fuel control requirementis essential to achieve timely attainment of the standard. EPA believesthat a fuel control measure may be ``necessary'' for timely attainmentif no other measures that would bring about timely attainment exist, orif such other measures exist and are technically possible to implement,but are unreasonable or impracticable. Otherwise, no fuel control wouldever be ``necessary'', since for any area there is at least one measure_namely,required shutdowns and prohibitions on driving_that would result in timelyattainment of the CO NAAQS. It is doubtful that Congress would have intendedto bar EPA from promulgating/approving State fuel controls into a SIP basedon the availability of such drastic alternatives. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ One court, in <T3>Exxon </T3>v. <T3>City of New York, </T3>548 F.2d 1088 (2d Cir. 1977), has suggestedthat EPA'S regulation of the lead content of gasoline amounts under subparagraph(ii) to the preemption of State controls of any aspect of the content ofgasoline (unless identical to the federal lead content control). As describedin the text above, EPA does not agree with that holding and hence doesnot believe that the reasoning of the decision should apply in other cases.Nevertheless, the discussion in the text below addresses the hypotheticalcase in which a court construing subparagraph (ii)'s application to theMaricopa SIP/FIP were to agree with the result in <T3>Exxon. </T3>It is clear that the reductions achievable by an oxygenated fuels programare essential to bringing about timely attainment of the CO standard inthe Maricopa CO nonattainment area. Maricopa needs a reduction in CO emissionsof 22.0 percent (relative to the MAG plan's baseline control program) toattain in 1991. The other measures that are being proposed for approvaland emission reduction credit will provide only a small portion of thosereductions. The SIP as it stands now has an unmet reduction need of almost19 percentage points of this 22.0 percent target. Even with a locally adoptedor federally implemented trip reduction program for large employers, afurther reduction of about 17 percent would be needed. A portion of thiscould be obtained from the loaded I/M test provision of H.B. 2014, leavingan unmet reduction need of about 14 percent. It is apparent that the unmet reductions needed to attain by 1991 mustbe largely satisfied by a fuels modification program of some sort. Thealternative CO control measures that would achieve the emission reductionsnecessary to bring about attainment in that time frame without a fuelsprogram_e.g., gas rationing, severe road tolls, substantial gas taxes,enforced curtailment of driving_would impose unreasonable costs and burdenson the local population. Some other, longer-term measures, such as furtherimplementation of existing strategies (e.g., bus lanes and other mass transitimprovements) and new measures like a light rail transit system, mightultimately become available for implementation in Maricopa, but not by1991. EPA, therefore, believes it can find that a fuels program is ``necessary''for attainment. EPA proposes to make such a finding for the specific programcontained in the proposed FIP. However, attention must be paid to the limitsof the possible finding with respect to specific requirements which mightappear in new State legislation. First, because EPA (1) believes that a properly crafted oxygen contentrequirement can provide for 1991 attainment under both warm and cool ambientconditions but (2) is uncertain of the CO emission reduction effectivenessof RVP reductions at cooler temperatures that are important in Phoenix,EPA does not believe it can make the required finding of necessity forany CO-related State program of more stringent RVP limitations. EPA doesnot have before it for action an ozone or other SIP revision which mightsupport a finding with respect to RVP limitations outside the CO season.Therefore, EPA does not propose a section 211(c)(4)(C) finding with respectto more stringent State RVP controls. If, contrary to EPA's belief, pre-emptionwith respect to RVP has occurred, EPA's future approval of a CO SIP revisioncontaining new fuels legislation will not authorize Arizona to enforcesuch RVP controls. Again, the Agency wants to stress that it does not believe Federal pre-emptionof a State oxygenated fuels and/or RVP program has occurred. Nonetheless,EPA believes it can make a section 211(c)(4)(C) finding for State controlson oxygen content and wishes to do so today. The Clean Air Act, however,may not intend that EPA approve expansive State programs that exceed therequirements for attainment just because some lesser program is ``necessary.''Some of the bills now before the legislature clearly do exceed the requirementsfor attainment in that they extend farther beyond the boundaries of theMaricopa CO nonattainment area than reasonably needed to affect CO emissionsin the CO nonattainment area, they extend into months of the year in whichCO violations do not occur (or in which the CO exceedances are at low enoughconcentrations that they would be eliminated by 1991 without oxygenatedfuels), or they have the possible effect of requiring a higher level ofoxygenation than required for attainment. The Agency requests commentson these and any other potential State program elements that might exceedthe requirements for attainment.To address these issues and to lay the procedural foundation for finalapproval of new legislation without need for another <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice and period for public comment, EPA liststhe following as conditions or restrictions on its proposed finding thatan oxygenated fuels program is ``necessary'' within the meaning of paragraph(C) of section 211(c)(4). These would only apply if pre-emption exists.EPA requests comments on the appropriateness of these conditions. To theextent that the provisions of new legislation by Arizona conform to theseconditions, a final finding by EPA will allow Arizona to enforce thoseprovisions. If there is actual legislation submitted as a SIP revisionthat poses issues of approvability that are not adequately addressed bythese conditions, EPA will repropose its finding and provide further opportunityfor comment. (The Agency may modify some of the specific details describedbelow based on comments received in response to the proposed FIP.) 1. The State program may restrict only fuel introduced into commerce inthe Maricopa CO nonattainment area. Fuel in other areas may fall underrestriction only as reasonably necessary to allow for an enforceable programfor the benefit of Maricopa County. This might, for example, require theregulation of all fuel passing through the pipeline terminal tank farmin Phoenix, or an expansion of the program boundaries to incorporate allof Maricopa County. 2. The oxygen content restriction may apply to fuel first introduced intocommerce between October 1 of one calendar year and March 31 of the nextcalendar year. It may apply to fuel actually dispensed from refueling stationsonly between October 15 and March 31. 3. The level of the oxygen content requirement or specification(s) mayonly be such that in combination with other CO controls that have beenadopted the CO reduction achieved is no larger than needed to completethe 22 percent reduction target for 1991 attainment, within a reasonablelimit. This consideration allows Arizona to select between, for example,a loaded I/M test and a higher level of stringency for the oxygen contentrequirement. EPA will exclude any Federally promulgated trip reductionprogram in judging satisfaction of this condition. EPA also request comments on two remaining issues in the area of preemption.The first is what EPA can and should do in a final SIP approval actionif the actual fuels legislation submitted in a SIP revision conforms inpart to the above three conditions but not entirely. For example, Arizonamight adopt an oxygen content law that applies only in the Maricopa COnonattainment area, but runs year round. EPA requests comment on whetherthe provisions of new State legislation can be considered separable forpurposes of a section 211(c)(4)(C) finding. This would allow EPA to makea finding only with respect to October through March, for example. Commentis requested on the separability issue generally and on what the State'sobligation would be, if any, to repeal provisions that are not approvedby EPA. Since EPA believes preemption does not apply at all in this case,EPA believes that no obligation exists. The second remaining issue concerns the exact wording of the section 211(c)(4)(A)restriction on State action: ``no State * * * may prescribe or attemptto enforce * * *''. EPA believes that this does not require Arizona toobtain a final EPA finding under section 211(c)(4)(C) before enactmentof legislation, even though the enactment might be in some sense a prescriptionin itself. If legislation is enacted and a finding is made after enactment,the single issue of timing should not in EPA's opinion be an obstacle toEPA approval and should not leave the legislation open to challenge incourt.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Economic Impact </ITAG>The Agency has estimated the cost of the proposed alternative fuels programbased primarily on the results of existing economic analyses that evaluatedsuch a requirement as a CO reduction strategy. Most of these studies weredone for the Denver area, because that region was the first to mandatethe use of oxygenated fuels beginning with the winter of 1988. [Reference8, 9, 10] However, there has also been one study by Energy and EnvironmentalAnalysis, Inc. (EEA) for the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG)that focused specifically on Maricopa County. [Reference 11] The cost of the oxygenated fuels program for the Phoenix area is comprisedof many elements. Several of the most important are: (1) The cost of thepure oxygenate compound (e.g., MTBE or ethanol), including delivery chargesif blending is performed locally rather than at the refinery or if therefinery is remote from the source of the oxygenate compound; (2) the amountof the oxygenate used in the blend; (3) whether a special low volatilitygasoline must be used for blending; (4) whether cost-saving refinery adjustmentscan be made to reduce the octane of the oxygen-free base gasoline; (5)the cost of any necessary fuel distribution equipment changes and maintenance,including storage tank cleaning for ethanol blends: (6) credits for anyfederal tax incentives that may apply to ethanol blends (e.g., the sixcent per gallon federal excise tax exemption); (7) the possibility of asmall fuel economy penalty that may accompany the use of oxygenated fuelsrelative to gasoline; and (8) the amount of fuel consumed during the mandatedcompliance period. The overall cost of the program can be expressed as the expected increasein gasoline prices during the mandatory compliance period. These valuesare readily available, or can be computed, from the above referenced studiesfor Gasohol (10 percent ethanol) and 11 percent MTBE. The estimated increasefor Gasohol ranges from 0.7 to 7.4 cents per gallon. For 11 percent MTBE,the estimated increase ranges from 0.05 to 3.4 cents per gallon. Usingthe upper and lower end of these cost estimates, the total annual costfor oxygenated fuels in the Phoenix area can be roughly approximated. Basedon a six month compliance period, fuel consumption in the Phoenix areaof approximately 3 million gallons per day, and a program consisting ofa 50 percent market share for Gasohol and 11 percent MTBE, respectively,the annual cost of the program is estimated at between $8 million and $31million. More complete information on EPA's economic analysis is availablein the Technical Support Document. EPA has estimated the cost to the regulated community of the proposed EmployerAlternative Modes Incentives Program (EAMIP) based on the information developedfor MAG by K.T. Analytics, Inc. \10\<NOTE/> K.T. Analytics looked at the costs of implementing trip reductionprograms at several employers in the San Francisco Bay Area. Most of theemployers surveyed are located in the suburban sections of the Bay Areaand not in San Francisco proper; therefore, the primary commute mode oftheir employees is the single-occupant vehicle, a condition which is mirroredin Maricopa County. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ K.T. Analytics, Inc., ``Review of TSM Ordinances andParking Management Programs for the Maricopa Association of Governments,''August 24, 1987, pp. 19-20. K.T. Analytics found a wide range in the cost of trip reduction programs.Factors influencing the total cost included number of employees, locationof the worksite, full- or part-time transportation coordinator position,and most importantly the number and type of trip reduction incentives offered.The most expensive programs were those that had full-time transportationcoordinators and offered shuttle buses from or to transit stations and/orsubsidized vanpools. From its survey, K.T. Analytics estimated the average cost to employersfor trip reduction programs. These costs are shown in Table 9. Averagecosts are broken down by employee size_``large'' employers (more than 1,000employees) and ``small'' employers (less than 500 employees)_and by programcomplexity_``moderate'' and ``extensive.'' Moderate programs typicallyhave part-time (i.e. half-time or less) transportation coordinators, companyrideshare matching programs, but no carpool or vanpool subsidies. Moderateprograms can include bus pass subsidies. Extensive programs have full ornearly full-time coordinators, car or vanpool subsidies,\11\<NOTE/> and/or shuttle bus services. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ A car or vanpool subsidy can range from free or subsidizedparking to employers covering the entire cost of operating the car or vanpool(purchase of the vehicle, maintenance, gasoline, and insurance). A typical``subsidy'' is the employer leasing or purchasing the vehicle, providingmaintenance and insurance, but recovering all or part of the cost by chargingthe car- or vanpool members a monthly fee. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,xs38,xs38 </C><T4>Table </T4>9._<T4>Annual Cost Ranges for Employer Trip Reduction Programs </T4><H1>Level of effort </H1><H1>Employer size </H1><H2>Small </H2><H2>Large</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Modest <D>$10,000-$20,000 </D><D>$30,000-$60,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Extensive <D>$30,000-$60,000 </D><D>$100,000-$250,000</D></ITAG></ITAG> Before describing the total cost to employers in Maricopa County of implementingthe proposed Employer Alternative Mode Incentives Program, two points shouldbe made. First, the costs described below are to the employer not to theindividual commuter. Second, it is the employer  who selects the incentivesthat he will offer his employees. While the proposed EAMIP has some fixedcosts, the greatest determining factor in the cost of the regulation tothe individual employer is the package of the incentives he offers. Becausethe proposed EAMIP does not dictate what incentives must be offered, theemployer is free to choose from among the myriad of incentives the onesthat are appropriate to his worksite and his employees. Fixed costs to the employer under the proposed EAMIP are the disseminationof alternative mode information,\12\<NOTE/> conducting and analyzing an employee survey, preparing atrip reduction plan and annual report, and appointing a transportationcoordinator. EPA believes that the greatest fixed cost to most employerswill be appointing a transportation coordinator. EPA estimates that anemployer with up to 500 employees will need to staff the transportationcoordinator position for a maximum of one day per week and in most casesless, especially after the program is up and running, and if a coordinatoris shared by a group of employers. The staffing required at larger employerswill depend on the complexity of the trip reduction program. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Under the proposed method of implementing the EAMIP,much of this information would be prepared by EPA or its contractor andprovided to the employer. The employer would then need to copy it for disseminationto his employees.While EPA has estimates of the cost of trip reduction programs for individualemployers, it is difficult to calculate the cumulative employer costs becauselittle data is available on the number of employers with more than 100employees at a worksite. This information is not routinely collected, andwhen it is, it is generally considered confidential. Regional profilesof employer sizes, which are readily available, are misleading becausemany employers (e.g. supermarket chains, school districts, banks) havedispersed workforces. While K.T. Analytics estimates that there are over1100 employers of more than 100 employees in the MAG region,\13\<NOTE/> the MAG Transportation Planning Office (MAGTPO) estimatedwhen modeling the impact of the model MAG trip reduction ordinance thatthere are approximately 700 worksites with more than 100 employees, 125of which have more than 350 employees.\14\<NOTE/> EPA used MAGTPO's figures on the numbers of worksites todetermine the regional costs of the EAMIP. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Memorandum Kiran Bhatt (K.T. Analytics, Inc.) to LindyBauer (MAG), on ``summary of Regional and Local Data,'' November 16, 1987,p.5. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ Maricopa Association of Government Transportation PlanningOffice, <T3>Documentation of Traffic Modeling and Transportation Control MeasureAnalysis for Use in the Air Quality Modeling for the Maricopa County NonattainmentArea</T3> (April, 1987), pp. 5-6. Because the MAGTPO numbers are not broken down any further than between350 or more and 100 or more employees at a worksite, EPA assumed that costsfor a ``large'' employer in Table 6 are applicable to all employers with350 or more employees at a worksite and that the cost for a ``small'' employerare applicable for employers with 100 to 349 employees at a worksite. Basedon this assumption and the upper and lower ends of K.T. Analytics' figures,the range of the total cost of complying with the proposed EAMIP can beapproximated as between $9.5 and $65.8 million. Given the relatively lowtrip reduction goals in the proposed EAMIP, EPA believes most employerswill need only modest programs to comply with the regulation. Under thisassumption, total regional costs for employers for the proposed EAMIP rangefrom $9.5 to $19.0 million. Finally, these costs should not be evaluatedin isolation, but should be weighed against the broader benefits that TROsprovide to all commuters, employers, transit/rideshare programs, localgovernments, and taxpayers. These benefits include decreased congestion,decreased trip times for non-affected commuters, delayed infrastructureinvestment, reduced employer parking requirements, and increased transit/rideshareusage.In assessing whether to implement (1) a trip reduction program in combinationwith an oxygenated fuels program or (2) an oxygenated fuels program witha higher oxygen requirement, EPA intends to examine the relative costsof each program. More specifically, the costs of raising the oxygen requirementfrom 2.57 percent to 2.79 percent will be compared to the costs of implementingthe trip reduction ordinance. Should evidence become available that raisingthe oxygen requirement can be implemented effectively with lower costs,EPA would consider this result along with other advantages and disadvantagesof the measures in its decision on the nature of the final promulgatedrule. The Agency is seeking information and comments on the costs of theseapproaches for attaining the necessary CO reduction in Maricopa County.The two alternative control strategies considered in this package havediffering cost effectiveness. The alternative fuels program is likely tohave cost effectiveness values from $100 to $700 per ton of CO reduced.For the TRO, the cost effectiveness is likely to range roughly from $1000to $5000 per ton of CO reduced. These values are based on very preliminaryinformation. EPA will be undertaking a more detailed analysis of the costsand cost effectiveness of this program between the proposal and final promulgation.EPA requests comments on the costs and cost effectiveness of the alternativecontrol strategies proposed today, and on the utility of considering costsand cost effectiveness in making the final decision.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Secondary Environmental Effects </ITAG>An increase in emissions of volatile organic compounds, a precursor toozone, may be associated with the use of oxygenated fuels in the fall andwinter months. This would result if the oxygenated fuels have a highervolatility than existing gasoline fuels. Arizona regulated gasoline volatilityduring the spring and summer months. EPA's proposed oxygenated fuels programwill not affect these limits on gasoline volatility. In order to determine whether a potential increase in volatile organiccompounds emissions could cause violations of the ozone NAAQS, EPA reviewedthe historic ozone data for Maricopa County. During the fourth quarterof 1981, one exceedance, just slightly above the ozone NAAQS, was recordedin the region. Since that time, EPA's air quality data shows no ozone exceedancesat any monitoring station within Maricopa County between October 1 andMarch 31. Indeed, the typical maximum observed concentration for this sixmonth period since 1980 is substantially below the ozone NAAQS of 0.12ppm. Ambient concentrations above the standard typically occur between Juneand August with the highest number and levels of ozone exceedances occurringin August. Based on this analysis of seasonal ozone data, EPA does notexpect that the oxygenated fuels program will cause or contribute to anyviolations of the ozone standard in the Maricopa area. [Reference 12] The use of oxygenated fuels may also affect the emissions of other exhaustpollutants such as formaldehyde. This pollutant is of concern because laboratoryanimal testing and limited epidemiological studies have shown this compoundhas the potential to cause cancer in humans. An EPA-sponsored study showedthat total aldehydes can increase 20-45 percent with the use of ethanolblends. [Reference 12] The increase with MTBE blends was similar. However,very little of this increase for the ethanol blends studied was causedby changes in formaldehyde emissions. Instead, most of the increase intotal aldehydes is believed to be associated with a greater productionof acetaldehyde. This compound has been found to be carcinogenic in someanimal studies, but there is inadequate evidence of its carcinogenicityin humans. The animal data that is available indicated acetaldehyde wouldhave a carcinogenic potency of at most four percent that of formaldehyde.It is also important to note that mobile source emissions of formaldehydeand total aldehydes in general will continue to decrease as exhaust hydrocarbonscontinue to decrease with more newer model year vehicles in the fleet.Therefore, the use of gasoline oxygenate blends will not reverse the trendtowards lower formaldehyde and total aldehyde emissions as older vehiclesare replaced with newer ones.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis </ITAG>The Administrator has determined that this proposal does not constitutea major proposed regulation, as defined in section 1(b) of Executive Order12291. Specifically, the proposed rule will cost less than $100 millionannually, will cause no major price increases, and should not have a significantadverse effect on competition, productivity, or investment. Accordingly,no Regulatory Impact Analysis is necessary. However, the Agency has prepareda Technical Support Document that contains a detailed assessment of theArizona SIP revisions for Maricopa County, as well as additional technicalinformation supporting the FIP proposal as described in today's <T4>Federal Register. </T4>It also contains an analysis of the public commentsreceived in response to an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on theArizona FIP, which was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 30, 1987 (52 FR 45466). The Technical Support Document has been placed in the public docket andis available for review in the City of Phoenix, at the locations referencedin the beginning of today's notice. In addition, interested parties mayobtain single copies through a written request to the public contact listedpreviously. This proposed regulation also was submitted to the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) for review as required by Executive Order 12291. Any writtencomments from OMB and EPA response to those comments have been placed inthe public docket for this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Impact on Small Entities </ITAG>Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that the Administratorcertify regulations that do not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. I certify that this proposed regulation willnot have such an effect for three primary reasons. First, many of the entitiesaffected by the proposed rule are not ``small.'' Refiners, large distributors,service stations owned by major oil companies or large independent companies(accounting for about 25 percent of public refueling facilities), and employerswith 100 or more employees do not constitute small entities. Second, thegeographic scope of the proposed regulation as it may affect small entitiesis limited to a portion of Maricopa County, Arizona. Third, compliancewith the alternative fuels program generally will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities because of the limitedcapital investment required.
