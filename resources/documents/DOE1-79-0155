<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-79-0155 </DOCNO><TEXT>The well-known electron gas model is cast into a path-integral version,then its dynamic structure factor S(q,q{sub 0}) studied systematically.The study shows that q/sub c/ defined in RPA not only is the thresholdfor a bare plasmon, but also in general the one for any number of renormalizedplasmons. Particularly studied was the large-momentum-transfer case (qandgt; q/sub c/). It is proved that the self-energy correction appearing inthe pertinent Green functions of S(q,q{sub 0}) vanishes. Those theoreticalresults indicate that the first peak in the fine structure of S(q,q{sub0}) observed in experiments for large q ({similar_to} 1.5 q/sub f/) neithercomes from a plasmon nor occurs due to a particle life-time or a self-energycorrection. Explanation for the first peak is that it arises from a strongcorrelation between single-pair excitation and multi-pair excitationinvolving only a few pairs (CSF). This conclusion was reached followinga qualitative study of a two-particle irreducible part of diagrams; somefurther elaborate numerical calculations are needed to confirm this hypothesis.An approximate, but nevertheless closed, formula for summing a set ofscreened ladder diagram (SLD), which describes the strongest correlationbetween single-pair and a few (two) pairs, is presented.</TEXT></DOC>
