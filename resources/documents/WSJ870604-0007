The sale is expected to be completed June 18. British GE isn't related to General Electric Co. of the U.S.    PENINSULAR andamp; ORIENTAL STEAM NAVIGATION CO. launched a bid to buy the 22% of its Australian unit, Pandamp;O Australia Ltd., that it doesn't already own. The offer values the unit at 150 million Australian dollars ($107.3 million). The British company said it will subsequently seek a listing on the Australian stock market.    REDLAND PLC of Britain reiterated that it wants to maintain a &quot;substantial&quot; interest in MONIER LTD. of Australia, despite an increased takeover offer for the latter company. Redland holds 49.9% of Monier; both companies make building materials. On Tuesday, EQUITICORP TASMAN LTD., a New Zealand investment concern, launched an offer of nearly 650 million Australian dollars ($465 million), for Monier, topping a 593 million-dollar bid by CSR LTD., an Australian sugar-refining and building-materials company. Redland said yesterday that it will meet with Equiticorp next week.    UNITED NEWSPAPERS PLC said that it has control of 41.76% of EXTEL GROUP PLC and that it extended its takeover offer to next Monday from last Tuesday. United is offering 103 of its shares for every 100 Extel shares in a bid valued at a total of #244.3 million ($401.3 million). Extel is a British financial-information company; United publishes the Express and Star newspapers of Britain.    WINTERTHUR SCHWEIZERISCHE VERSICHERUNGS-GESELLSCHAFT, one of Switzerland's three biggest insurance groups, said it plans to expand its foreign operations and pay special attention to the U.S. and Europe. With as much as 740 million Swiss francs ($500 million) available, to be raised through the issue of participation certificates, the company is examining ways to boost its presence in foreign markets, perhaps through acquisitions, its managing director said. </TEXT></DOC>
