The proposed sale of several BAe 146 passenger jets toIran's domestic carrier, Asseman Airlines, is creating apolicy dispute between two otherwise close allies. A BritishAerospace spokesman confirmed that the company has received&quot;informal indications&quot; that the U.S. State Department won'tapprove its application to sell the aircraft.</LP><TEXT>   The State Department said it's legally bound to keepspecific license applications confidential. But it confirmedthat the U.S. has recently made several decisions involving&quot;aircraft re-exports&quot; to Iran and that the U.S. has a policyof denying the &quot;re-export of controlled aircraft or aircraftparts&quot; to Iran and other countries that support terrorism.   Richard Boucher, the department's spokesman, said in abriefing that U.S. law requires the government to exercisesuch controls even on foreign-made aircraft if 10% of more oftheir content is of U.S. origin. The British government hasgrudgingly accepted such restrictions in the past but hasstated its opposition to the &quot;extra-territorial&quot; applicationof U.S. laws.   The BAe 146, a short-haul airliner that can seat 85 to 96passengers, is equipped with flight controls from HoneywellInc., Minneapolis; turbofan engines from Textron Lycoming, inStratford, Conn.; and wings from Textron Aerostructures,Nashville, Tenn. The last two companies are subsidiaries ofTextron Inc., Providence, R.I.   The British government, which regards the proposed salemerely as a &quot;normal commercial transaction,&quot; has been urgingWashington to approve the application since it was filed lastyear. Foreign diplomats said that British Foreign SecretaryDouglas Hurd took up the matter with Secretary of State JamesBaker last week. One bone of contention has been London'sclaim that the U.S. had earlier raised no objections toIran's purchase of Dutchmade Fokker 100 airliners, which aresimilar in size to the BAe 146 and also contain U.S. parts.   Aerospace experts believe that the U.S. is treating theproposed BAe sale differently because it doesn't want Iran toacquire technology that would enable it to repair its largestockpile of U.S.-made fighter jets.</TEXT></DOC>
