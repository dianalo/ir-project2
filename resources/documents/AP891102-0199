Baker IIImet Friday with Foreign Minister Gareth Evans for talks centeringon the Australian-U.S. dispute over agricultural subsidies.   Evans, who said trade has ``always been an element in ourrelationship,'' labeled the U.S. Farm Bill, the American ExportEnhancement Program and sugar protection measures as issuesdividing the two countries.   Baker however said the two countries share similar perspectiveson most issues to a ``remarkable degree,'' adding, ``Whenever we donot see eye-to-eye, we can rely on our tradition of closeconsultations.''   In addition to trade, the two days of talks that end Saturdayare expected to include East-West relations, chemical weapons andreforms in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and China.   Baker praised Australia's role as an ally in the two world warsand the Korean conflict, adding that both countries are ``boostersof an open international trading system.''   ``We can take pride in the work our nations have done to promotea more open, market-oriented international trading system,'' hesaid. ``We applaud the highly constructive role Australia hasplayed in our mutual efforts to strengthen the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT) rules governing agricultural trade,''   Evans replied: ``But what gives us heart is the evidentwillingness of the U.S. to work to get genuine and lastingimprovements in international trading arrangements.''   Vice President Dan Quayle was criticized on a visit this summerfor saying he didn't believe Australian concerns about subsidiesfor U.S. farm exports, prompting Trade Minister Michael Duffy tosay Quayle didn't know what he was talking about.   Baker arrived Thursday night with Defense Secretary Dick Cheneyfor the talks that replace those held annually when New Zealand wasa functioning partner of the ANZUS treaty.   New Zealand's 1984 anti-nuclear policy, which banned port visitsby U.S. nuclear-powered warships, led to a major rift with the U.S.   Baker said in Washington before leaving he would not meet withany New Zealand officials.   But in the first sign of cooperation since the two countriesdrifted apart, the U.S. government Friday announced support for aresolution in the United Nations against driftnet fishing that wasco-sponsored by New Zealand.   The New Zealand Prime Minister, Geoffrey Palmer, said inWellington that his labor government had been working closely withthe U.S. on the resolution since a visit in September.   ``I am delighted with the outcome,'' Palmer said.   Baker and Cheney head the highest-level U.S. delegation toAustralia in more than 20 years. Commerce Secretary Robert A.Mosbacher and Trade Representative Carla Hills also are visitingfor a 12-nation economic conference of Pacific Rim countriesstarting Monday.   Baker and Evans emphasized in their statements the closerelationship between Canberra and Washington.   ``I cannot overstate the value the United States attaches tocontinued excellent relations with Australia,'' said Baker, addingthat this was his first visit and, ``I do not plan to be a strangerDown Under.''   The talks at Watson Naval Base conclude Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
