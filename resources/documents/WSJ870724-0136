Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FORGN LABOR EUROP JAPANMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><TEXT>   Just as the weak dollar is making American companies more competitive overseas, it is helping cause new headaches at home: The correspondingly strong yen, pound and mark make it easier than ever for foreign rivals to set up shop in the U.S.    In the past, businessmen, labor leaders and politicians have generally welcomed such investment, and most still do. Foreign companies operating here can create jobs, pump new capital and technology into aging industries, and even cut the huge U.S. trade deficit by reducing imports.    But now, a few chilly drafts are wafting through the usual warm reception. More American companies are discovering that the foreign-investment boom also brings more tough foreign competitors to play on the home turf. Others worry about becoming the target of a hostile tender offer from abroad. And as nonunion foreign companies proliferate, some labor unions are fretting over the erosion of their membership and political influence and complaining about the difficulty of bargaining with unionized U.S. units of foreign concerns.    The worries are being sparked by booming investment from Western Europe as well as Japan.    The pace of direct foreign investment has certainly become dizzying. In recent weeks alone, a British holding company agreed to acquire Smith andamp; Wesson, the famed 135-year-old U.S. arms maker; a West German tire maker successfully bid for GenCorp Inc.'s General Tire unit; and at least five Japanese companies announced plans to build U.S. factories making products ranging from laboratory equipment to auto batteries. And this week, France's Thomson S.A. agreed to acquire General Electric Co.'s consumer-electronics business -- and thus become the largest manufacturer of television sets in the U.S.    In all last year, foreign concerns, mostly from Europe and Japan, plowed a net $24.7 billion into U.S. companies, factories and real estate. That lifted their direct investment here to a record $209.3 billion, more than double the total at the start of the decade.    &quot;The tendency is to think all this investment is unmitigated good,&quot; says Clyde Prestowitz, a former counselor to U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige. &quot;But I think there are legitimate questions. . . . We need to be sure that the United States gets the maximum possible benefits from foreign investments.&quot;    Others are more blunt: &quot;The dollar has now reached the point where further declines place everything for sale in this country at fire-sale prices,&quot; says Henry Wendt, the chief executive of SmithKline Beckman Corp.    Past surges of investment from abroad have prompted similar flurries of concern, which later proved overdrawn. During the early 1970s, many Americans feared that Arab oil-producing nations would snap up American assets on a huge scale; yet the effect was barely noticeable.    Moreover, foreign-investment worries go both ways. Juergen F. Strube, the chief executive of BASF Corp., the American unit of the West German chemical giant, likens present U.S. uneasiness to similar fears in Europe in the 1950s and 1960s about the then-aggressive American multinationals. Though conceding that when investment surges &quot;in such a short time, it creates tension,&quot; he affirms the majority view: &quot;International integration is helpful. . . . It's good for America, it has been good for Europe, and if we can gain access to the Japanese and Far Eastern markets, it'll be good there, too.&quot;    Nonetheless, the competitive landscape in some U.S. industries is clearly changing. Four of the nation's top 10 chemical companies and more than half of the cement industry are foreign-owned, and soon there will be more Japanese than American concerns making cars in the U.S. Foreign companies are beginning to dominate even such obscure industries as burglar alarms.    Some people in the hot seat find it difficult to be philosophical. When Japan's Dainippon Ink andamp; Chemicals Inc. made a takeover bid for Reichhold Chemicals Inc. earlier this month, for example, the American company initially not only spurned the offer but also went shopping for Washington-connected attorneys to &quot;look into Japanese takeovers of American firms.&quot; A recent poll by Chemical Week, a trade publication, found that 31% of executives at U.S. chemical companies feared the wave of foreign takeovers sweeping their industry; just 18% were enthusiastic.    Foreign investment &quot;is the greatest issue of our time,&quot; says Lee Kadrich, the director of government affairs and trade for the Automotive Parts and Accessories Association. &quot;If you continue to allow an increase in capacity, clearly it's got to come out of someone else's hide, and clearly it's going to be the hides of the domestic industry.&quot; By one estimate, some 300 Japanese auto-parts makers are expected to set up U.S. operations between now and 1990.    There are already some mechanisms for control, including the antitrust and securities laws, and a government committee that can review foreign investments that may have major implications for U.S. national interests. Late last year, that committee and several government departments debated Fujitsu Ltd.'s proposed acquisition of control of California-based Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. after competitors and various Reagan administration officials raised objections. In the end, Fujitsu withdrew before any government resolution. (Ironically, Fairchild is already owned by Schlumberger Ltd., a conglomerate founded by two Frenchmen and now based in the Netherlands Antilles.)    The official administration position still favors free and open access, and so far no one is proposing a halt to direct foreign investment. But the rising anxiety across the nation is starting to make some impression in Washington.    The sweeping trade bill passed by the House contains a provision that would require foreign investors to report to the government any significant interest they hold in a U.S. business or real estate, as well as holdings of large blocks of corporate securities. Sponsor John Bryant, a Texas Democrat, insists that he doesn't oppose foreign investment; he says he just wants everyone to know where it is coming from: &quot;America has been selling off its family jewels to pay for a night on the town, and we don't know enough about the proud new owners.&quot;    The Senate-passed trade bill would give the administration authority to review foreign acquisitions of U.S. businesses to determine the effects on national security or essential commerce affecting national security.    The House also recently passed a bill that would prohibit the use of federal community-development funds for any project that would increase a foreign company's market share at the expense of a domestic concern. And in Illinois, the state senate recently adopted legislation requiring the state to analyze, before any incentives could be offered, the competitive effects of a foreign company locating there.    &quot;The political issue of the 1990s isn't going to be imports; it's going to be the foreign invasion of the United States,&quot; comments Paul Krugman, an economist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.    Meanwhile, the weak dollar continues to lure foreign direct investment. Jean-Louis Beffa, the president of Cie. de Saint-Gobain of France, estimates that it now is 10% cheaper to make certain glass and other products in the U.S. than to send them here from Europe.    In addition, establishing an American operation has become downright cheap. In the spring of 1985, Dainippon Ink tried to buy Sun Chemical Corp.'s printing-ink business, but Sun's $550 million price looked steep: the equivalent of 132 billion yen. A deal was finally struck in August 1986, and Sun got its $550 million, but the cost to the Japanese company had declined 36% to only 84 billion yen.    Fear that rising protectionist sentiment in the U.S. will translate into legislation or other barriers is also a powerful motivator. Japan's Komatsu Forklift Co. recently decided to build a factory in La Mirada, Calif., because it feared tariffs on its imports after an American competitor, Hyster Inc., accused Komatsu of dumping in the U.S., says Douglas Nuttall, the controller for Komatsu Forklift (U.S.A.) Inc.    Much of the controversy revolves around Japanese companies, relative newcomers to U.S. direct investment. Though the Japanese have only about one-tenth of the amount invested in U.S. operations that Europeans have, American concern over the burgeoning trade deficit has spotlighted the Japanese.    Ironically, the Japanese try to minimize potential conflicts. Rather than acquire U.S. companies, most Japanese concerns prefer to build brand-new factories -- to bring in their own technology and control quality. &quot;It is easier to start from scratch than to transfer technology to an existing U.S. company because of differences in management philosophies,&quot; says Keiji Endoh, the chairman of Ricoh Corp., the U.S. subsidiary of Ricoh Co.    However, that strategy irks some Americans because often the Japanese also bring with them their own suppliers, bankers and even construction companies to provide parts and services that many Americans had expected to provide.    &quot;There's always this great promise that the U.S. economy is going to be improved dramatically as these Japanese companies like Honda and Toyota create jobs and demands for services and supplies,&quot; says Matthew Coffey, the president of the National Tooling and Machining Association. &quot;They create a few jobs at tremendous expense to the state taxpayer, but they never wind up creating the demand because they have their loyalty to suppliers back home.&quot;    A recent United Auto Workers study estimates that a typical American-owned auto-assembly plant creates 25,000 jobs in U.S. supplier plants, while a typical Japanese assembly plant creates only 6,700 U.S. jobs. &quot;They aren't giving us the real good jobs in the production end,&quot; a UAW spokesman says.    Rep. Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat, contends that the Japanese &quot;come in and establish what amounts to colonies in the U.S. with their suppliers, and our people don't get a fair chance to bid into their production.&quot; She notes that even though Mazda Motor Corp., which is building an auto-assembly plant near Detroit, says it will buy seats from Lear Siegler Inc., an American manufacturer, a Mazda Japanese supplier will supply some components and technology to Lear Siegler. &quot;It's a completely closed system,&quot; she charges.    European companies, on the other hand, have avoided much controversy. A spate of takeovers in the U.S. cement industry, for example, has given foreigners 51% of U.S. cement production capacity, says William Toal, an economist at the Portland Cement Association. Yet the trend has gone virtually unnoticed by the American public.    But it hasn't escaped the cement workers. Henry Bechtholdt, who heads the U.S. cement workers' union, complains that bargaining with foreign-owned companies is difficult because it is hard to gauge their financial position. Their U.S. managers can sometimes duck awkward questions by pinning responsibility on the parent company back home, he says.    One reason Europeans seem to escape attention is they tend to blend into the U.S. economy, often using American banks, accountants and managers. &quot;Europeans have a long history and tradition of becoming insiders in the markets in which they operate,&quot; says Amir Mahini, the director of international business research at McKinsey andamp; Co. in New York.    For example, Bayer AG, a West German chemical company, does $4.25 billion in annual sales in the U.S. Its U.S. arm exports about 22% of its production and is the sole world-wide supplier of certain Bayer products. &quot;We're trying to be an attractive American company playing by American rules,&quot; says Konrad M. Weis, Bayer USA Inc.'s chief executive. &quot;We say when in Rome, behave as the Romans do.&quot; The German-born 58-year-old himself became a U.S. citizen in December 1985.    Not all acquisitions by European companies go smoothly, however. Hoechst AG's acquisition of Celanese Corp. last year was held up for weeks because of antitrust considerations -- a sign of how powerful the German chemical company has grown in the U.S.    And unlike the Japanese, Europeans -- and the British in particular -- are much more willing to attempt eye-catching hostile takeovers. Indeed, some aggressive foreign entrepreneurs such as Sir James Goldsmith and Robert Maxwell have become almost as familiar to Wall Street as Saul Steinberg and Carl Icahn.    Americans who have battled European takeover artists can become strong advocates of limiting foreign ownership of U.S. assets. Robert E. Mercer, the chief executive of Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co., which last year withstood a hostile bid by Sir James, told a Senate hearing recently that foreign takeovers &quot;are a threat to America's industrial base, its technology, its economy and its ability to produce materials that would well be needed in some future emergency, military or otherwise.&quot; Goodyear is so bitter that it pulled its business from J. Walter Thompson last month after the advertising agency was taken over by a British rival.    The takeover issue could heat up if, as some people predict, the Japanese change tactics and attempt more acquisitions. &quot;The people who run Japanese companies are smart, well-informed, and can figure out that they're simply better off making an acquisition if the right fit can be found,&quot; says James Martens, the managing director of Peers andamp; Co., a merchant-banking firm that advises Japanese companies on acquisitions and investments in the U.S.    But even he doesn't expect many hostile takeover attempts by the Japanese: &quot;I believe 90% of the Japanese would be very uncomfortable when they got into it, particularly in the political atmosphere here in the U.S. right now.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
