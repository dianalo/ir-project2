In assessing the importanceof this project in this context it is important to consider how informationderived from the knowledge of the sequence of the human genome mightbe applied globally for the management of genetic diseases. Because thefirst disorders of this type to be characterized at the molecular level,the hemoglobinopathies, are the commonest genetic diseases in the worldpopulation, and because programs for their control have been initiatedin parts of the developing world, it is already possible to define someof the problems that will arise in applying knowledge gained from a genomesequencing program to the improvement of the health of populations inwhich genetic diseases are particularly common. Here I outline what isknown about the world distribution of single gene disorders and aboutthe genetic component of important polygenic conditions in the developedand developing countries, and consider briefly the organizational difficultiesthat may be encountered in applying this new information to programsfor the prevention, and ultimately the treatment, of genetic disease.34 refs., 2 figs., 2 tabs.
