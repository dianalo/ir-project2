(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two space shuttles were on the moveMonday, with Columbia returning from California where it ended amission and Atlantis joining with rockets that will boost it towardorbit in October.   Columbia came back to its launch base bolted atop a Boeing 747jetliner that was forced to make an overnight stop in Georgiabecause of thunderstorms.   The 747 left Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., early Sunday andmade a refueling stop in Texas before being diverted to Robins AirBase, Ga., late in the day. Bad weather in the Southwest had delayedby 24 hours a planned Saturday departure from Edwards.   Columbia landed in California's Mojave Desert on Aug. 13 after afive-day secret military mission, which reportedly includeddeployment of a spy satellite and experiments related to the StarWars anti-missile program.   Atlantis, which completed a flight in May, was towed out of aprocessing hangar into an assembly building Monday to be mated withan external fuel tank and two solid fuel rockets for an Oct. 12launch.   Atlantis' five-member crew is to start the Galileo spacecraft ona six-year journey to orbit the planet Jupiter and drop a probe intoits atmosphere.   Columbia, the oldest space shuttle, now will be readied for a10-day December mission during which the crew of five is to releasea communications satellite and attempt to retrieve a sciencesatellite the size of a school bus.   The science satellite, called LDEF for long duration exposurefacility, was launched from another shuttle in 1984 and was to havebeen retrieved a year later. But delays, followed by the 1986explosion of the shuttle Challenger, held up the recovery mission.   Unusually high solar activity is expanding the atmosphere andincreasing drag on LDEF, raising the possibility it might reenterthe atmosphere and burn up, destroying valuable experiments, beforeColumbia's crew can salvage it. As a result, NASA is considering anearlier launch for the mission.   In between the Columbia and Atlantis flights, Discovery is totake off in November on another classified Defense Departmentmission.</TEXT></DOC>
