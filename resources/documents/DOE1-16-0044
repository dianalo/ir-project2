<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-16-0044 </DOCNO><TEXT>Wavelength tuning of 0.4 {mu}m has been obtained by the addition of 100Torr of H{sub 2} gas to a vacuum free-electron laser operating in thenear infrared. This experiment demonstrates that a relativistic electronbeam from an rf linac can propagate in a partially ionized gas with sufficientquality to achieve free-electron laser action. The picosecond pulse structureof the beam is believed responsible for the avoidance of plasma instabilities.Gain and wavelength measurements are consistent with theoretical expectations.</TEXT></DOC>
