Assuming there's a mainframe market left to go after,that Digital covets the business, and that anybody could do anything todislodge IBM?andM;No.andM;And yes.andM;Three advantagesandM;The first real advantage the VAX 9000 brings to Digital is to help satisfypent-up demand from current customers topping out in single-streamperformance.andP;  Not everybody sees a VAXcluster as the answer to capacityproblems.andP;  Some have topped out in VAXclusters and need more computing power.andO;Some applications just need the larger addressable memory, the 80 MB 1/0speeds of the system, and the 55 transactions per second the 210 canallegedly handle.andM;The second advantage to Digital for is in the integrated vector accelerator(and commensurate Fortran compiler) built into the 9000.andP;  Digital believes itis more than competitive with IBM's add-on Vector Facility for the 3090, and,perhaps more importantly, that it will help Digital fend off theminisupercomputer vendors in all but the most vector hungry environments.andO;Since most supercomputers and minisupercomputers work in and around VAXesanyway, this ought to give Digital a jump on getting the new application andvector processing upgrade business.andM;The third advantage is that the 9000 shows that Digital's engineeringcapabilities can develop mainframe-style machines.andP;  The company CAN do morethan make minicomputers.andP;  Some of the packaging issues solved in the 9000with the multi-chip unit (MCU) and high density signal carrier (HDSC), whichreplaces printed circuit boards, indicate that Digital has the engineeringtalent to play with the big boys.andP;  There are advances in housing,interconnection, and circuit cooling here.andM;Installed VAX base is criticalandM;So, to begin with, the 9000s will be aimed at the installed VAX base, will bepositioned against minisupercomputers in technical settings, and will shoreup Digital's image as a full-range system supplier.andP;  Coupled with theEnterprise Management Architecture and DECnet Phase V announcements yet tocome in the next six months, the 9000s show Digital can play in the sameglobal tier as IBM, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Unisys, and Bull.andM;And now one begins to see where Digital versus IBM comes in.andP;  To begin with,Digital hopes to parry IBM's counterthrust into technical markets with the9000 and, in some settings, to take away new applications and upgrade/add-onbusiness from IBM.andP;  At the least, the 9000 doesn't hurt in the war on BigBlue.andM;What's more, if the 9000 is the first issue out of the 6-year, $500 millionRandamp;D effort behind the MCU/HDSC technology and &quot;correct by design&quot;development, then the 9000 is First of an also talismanic.andP;  AsHewlett-Packard has done with its new line Precision Architecture, Digital isdoing here: refining the design and architectural work to the point where ithas as much or more impact as faster chips.andP;  Look for faster technologyinsertion at the high end from now on.andM;An example of fast-changing technology is the Model 410-440, the upgradeable1-4 unit, 27-100 MIP system still probably some months from introduction.andO;With this system able to handle up to 200 transaction per second in acommercial setting or 72 sustained megaflops in a scientific setting, Digitalpushes its upgrade path even further.andM;But head-to-head hardware competition between IBM and Digital is not verylikely, at least not yet.andP;  Mainframe vendor loyalty studies at InternationalData Corporation many years ago revealed a not surprising fact: very fewcompanies actually swap one manufacturer's mainframe for another's, IBM sitesleast of all.andM;Applications: the soft spotandM;But they DO move applications back and forth, and that is where the battlecan get steamy.andP;  in the multivendor setting  - which most mainframe-owningcompanies are these days  - the loyalty issue is one of grabbing applicationsfaster than the competitor in order to hasten upgrades.andM;Which means that, with the 9000 rounding out the product line, Digital isbetter able to fight the multifront battle.andP;  That battle will take place insuch areas as:andM;* Storage.andP;  Gigabyte disk drives make almost as much money for vendors asprocessors, and the old rule of thumb is that each unit of processing powerinstalled generates four added units of disk drive capacity.andM;* Service.andP;  Million-dollar machines beget millions more in service revenuesover five years  - even though the systems are getting easier to maintain allthe time.andP;  The 9000 is touted as particularly reliable.andM;*  Networking.andP;  Digital can now do more than just populate networks and sellmidrange nodes  - it can claim to have the big processing engines as well.andO;It may not displace IBM's SNA networks managed by NetView, but it may wellbecome the anchor for a company's multivendor networks.andM;* Application building blocks.andP;  These are the window, compound documentarchitecture, data base, and repository software packages that go with bigsystems used for general purpose computing.andM;The downside for Digital in all this is the sales and marketing firepowermismatch.andP;  IBM has been selling big systems for years, and even the janitorsin Armonk probably take orders from time to time.andP;  The company reeksmarketing and has found a way to be effective making staff functionariessupport the field sales troops.andM;Digital is still trying to figure out what kind of tie to wear to what kindof sales presentation.andP;  And Digital doesn't have anywhere near the softwarearsenal of IBM, which deals with over 20,000 software and serviceorganizations (SSOs).andM;What's more, IBM has almost as many people working in third party firms(called Agents) helping local sales people crack new accounts as Digital hastotal sales people.andP;  IBM has 24 industry marketing groups with hundreds ofstaffers in each.andP;  Digital has fewer and has just reorganized to boot.andM;Digital had to come out with a higher-end VAX:andM;* to prove it can do it; andandM;* to define computing power for the 1990s; andandM;* to anchor the kind of OLTP Digital needs to in order to survive as acomputing generalist.andM;But what a different sales and marketing ball game it has become.andM;The metamorphosis in market requirements in this regard is different byquantum leaps from, say, the metamorphosis required to go from sellingPDP-11s to selling VAXes.andM;It's a good thing for Digital the company is both both smart and lucky.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
