Jenninger resigned today after he was sharply criticized over aspeech he gave Thursday in which he reminded his audience thatHitler's rule was ``glorious'' in the view of many Germans.Jenninger, who also criticized the Nazis, made the speech during aceremony marking the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the nightthat began the Holocaust.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl also criticized his close friend andformer aide over the tone of the speech, the conservative Die Weltnewspaper said.   In his resignation announcement, Jenninger said today that he hasalways been an opponent of ``every type of totalitarian rule'' andthat he has been a consistent supporter of Israel.   Jenninger, in a 1982 interview with West German reporters, saidhe went into public service because his father told him the worldmust avoid another war like the one started by Nazi Germany in 1939.   ``Two of my brothers died in the war. My father told me when Iwas 12: `Be of service during your lifetime, so that something likethis can never again happen.' That influenced me,'' Jenninger saidthen.   Jenninger, a 56-year-old member of Kohl's conservative ChristianDemocratic Union, rode to the highest position in the Bundestag, orparliament, on a reputation for fairness and effectiveness.   As a close aide to Kohl, Jenninger was a leading figure behindpersuading East Germany to let more of its people visit or move toWest Germany.   Jenninger was also involved in preparations for a planned 1984visit to West Germany of East German leader Erich Honecker, but theSoviet Union vetoed the trip. Honecker did finally travel to WestGermany in 1987 _ the first East German leader ever to do so.   Jenninger was born June 10, 1932 in Rindelbach, in what is nowBaden-Wuerttenberg state.   He received his doctor of law degree in 1957 from the Universityof Tuebingen.   Jenninger began his political career in 1963 as an adviser in theDefense Ministry.   From 1966-69, Jenninger worked as a political adviser tothen-Finance Minister Franz Josef Strauss, a powerfularch-conservative politician who died last month.   Jenninger won a seat in the Bundestag in 1969 and has been amember ever since.   He became the Christian Democratic Union's chief parliamentarysecretary in the Bundestag in 1975, in charge of coordinating theparty's parliamentary affairs.   When Kohl became chancellor in October 1982, he awarded Jenningerfor his efforts by giving him the high-powered job of state ministerin the Chancellery.   Jenninger became Bundestag president on Nov. 5, 1984, afterRainer Barzel quit the post in a corruption scandal.   The Bundestag members elected Jenninger president with 340 of 469votes, reflecting the confidence his colleagues had in him.   The respected Die Zeit newspaper said at the time that Kohl mayhave lost Jenninger as his right-hand man, but that Jenninger was an``emergency victim for the sake of parliament.''</TEXT></DOC>
