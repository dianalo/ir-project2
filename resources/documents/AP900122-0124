LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Roh Tae-woo said Monday hisgoverning party and two moderate opposition groups will create anew party, a serious setback for the nation's most radical leaders.   ``We agreed to establish a new political order based onpolitical stability and create a new popular party of moderatedemocratic forces to meet the needs of the times,'' Roh said in atelevised address after a 10-hour meeting with opposition leadersKim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil.   The alignment boosted the chances of Kim Young-sam coming topower after Roh steps down in Feburary 1993 at the end of a singlefive-year term.   The two were bitter rivals in the presidential elections inDecember 1987, and Kim Young-sam accused Roh of vote fraud.   The new party will be assured of a two-thirds majority in the299-member National Assembly. It also will dwarf the largestopposition group, Party for Peace and Democracy, and limit itschances of coming to power.   The party's charismatic leader, Kim Dae-jung, denounced thealliance as a power grab, and radical students called it an attemptto prolong what they view as a pro-U.S. military dictatorship.   Students battled riot police with firebombs and rocks at fiveuniversities in Seoul and two other cities, and police arrestedhundreds of demonstrators.   Roh said the new party, tentatively named the Democratic LiberalParty, will be inaugurated within six months. Until then, Roh saidhe and Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil will lead a working committee.   He said Korea needed a new political order ``to overcome aneconomic crisis and effectively solve pending problems facing thenation.''   It will be the first time in Korea's history that a newpolitical party is formed by ruling and opposition parties.   Kim Youn-sam said the three leaders talked about changing thecountry's current presidential government system to a Cabinetstructure.   Roh and Kim did not elaborate, however, apparently in order toavoid friction with Kim Dae-jung.   Kim Dae-jung called the new party a ``a political coup d'etataimed at holding onto power.'' He said new elections should be heldas a referendum on the issue.   Governing party officials rejected the criticism, saying theopposition leader had been asked to form an alliance.   Party officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said thenew party will adopt a collective leadership, with Roh serving as aceremonial head and Kim Young-sam likely to be selected chairman.   Kim Jong-pil, who once served as prime minister under theassassinated autocratic president, Park Chung-hee, called thechange ``revolutionary'' and said he hoped other political``heavyweights'' would join the alliance.   Roh defeated the three Kims by a narrow margin in the 1987presidential election, the first democratic balloting in 16 years.Many Koreans blamed Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung for losing thepresidential election by splitting the opposition vote.</TEXT></DOC>
