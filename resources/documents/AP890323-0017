Ed Yingling of the American Bankers Association said the fineswould be ``wholly disproportionate'' and would inhibit the abilityof banks and savings institutions to attract quality managers anddirectors.   ``We must guard against an overreaction that may harm innocentparties and fundamental rights,'' Yingling said in testimonyprepared for delivery today to the House Judiciary subcommittee oncriminal justice.   Bush is proposing a top fine of $25,000 a day for most violationsbut up to $1 million if the violation was made with recklessdisregard for the safety of the institution. Yingling said themaximum penalty should be set at $2,500.   He was appearing before the panel one day after the GeneralAccounting Office, Congress' investigative agency, told thesubcommittee that it had examined 26 insolvent savings and loans ineight states and found evidence of fraud or abusive insider dealingin each.   Meanwhile, at a hearing Wednesday of a House Bankingsubcommittee, Joe D. Whitley, acting associate attorney general,urged Congress to maintain stiff penalties as a deterrent tofinancial fraud.   ``Because most bankers are honorable people, one might think thatmodest sanctions are all that is required to enforce compliance withour laws: A slap on the wrist is all that a gentleman requires,''Whitley said. ``The flaw in this rationale is that it is not thehonorable bankers who have caused the massive problems we facetoday.''   GAO officials said the pattern of fraud and abuse among failedthrifts ``clearly is pervasive.''   ``The bulk of the losses are directly attributable to the failureby management of a minority of the industry to follow basic, prudentbusiness practices,'' Assistant GAO Comptroller General FrederickWolf said. He did not name the 26 Sandamp;Ls it examined.   The Justice subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Charles E. Schumer,D-N.Y., complained that of the 11,000 Sandamp;L cases the Federal HomeLoan Bank Board has referred to the Justice Department in the lasttwo years for criminal prosecution, fewer than 200 have resulted inconvictions.   Whitley told the Banking subcommittee that financial institutioncases have overloaded the criminal justice system. A survey of FBIfield offices showed more than 8,000 pending cases, half of theminvolving losses of $100,000 or more.   Bush is proposing spending $50 million a year on discovering andprosecuting fraud at banks and Sandamp;Ls. The money would pay for 760investigators, auditors, attorneys and support staff, Whitley said.   Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., chairman of the examination task forceof the House Banking committee, warned of ``increasing shortages ofexperienced examiners.'' He noted that the creation of amulti-agency Sandamp;L task force with more than 1,200 examiners has leftthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which regulates commercialbanks, several hundred examiners under strength.   Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke, whose agencyregulates nationally-chartered banks, told Barnard that he is havingtrouble hiring and retaining experienced examiners. Nearly 30percent of the examination force consists of examiners with, onaverage, less than 3 years experience, he said, in a plea forauthority to offer higher salaries.   In another development, Federal Reserve Board Chairman AlanGreenspan said his agency is working closely with the TreasuryDepartment to develop a plan to handle the billions of dollars inreal estate the government will inherit from failed Sandamp;Ls.   But Greenspan, who would be a member of the oversight board ofthe government entity set up to dispose of the real estate, declinedto provide details of the plan to a House Banking subcommittee.   Some members of Congress are worried that government ``dumping''of Sandamp;L property at ``fire sale'' prices will ruin regional realestate markets, particularly in the Southwest.   Treasury and White House officials are considering a proposaldeveloped by R.T. McNamar, a California investment banker and aformer deputy Treasury secretary, that would spend state and federalmoney to hold onto foreclosed real estate for as long as 10 or 15years.</TEXT></DOC>
