Cromp plays both the visionary and the skeptic in his job astechnical head of the Intelligent Data Management project at NASA's NationalSpace Science Datt Center in Greenbelt, Md.andM;Cromp develops intelligent user interfaces for NASA using graphics, naturallanguage and expert systems.andM;&quot;If I can think of something, I tend to believe it can be implemented,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;Maybe I don't know how to do it, but if I can picture it in my head,why shouldn't we be able to build it?&quot;andM;At the same time, Cromp questions everything.andM;&quot;You should be developing theories and testing them to feel confident in whatyou're doing,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;You think it will work, and if it doesn't, youthrow it out and save what you can.&quot;andM;Cromp, 29, enjoys the challenge of reducing a difficult task to a number ofsubtasks.andP;  At present, his group is preparing for a massive influx of datafrom the Earth Observing System (EOS), which will be launched this decade.andM;&quot;We want to make sure we are prepared so that when NASA starts receiving thedata, we'll be able not only to store it correctly but to access it quickly,&quot;he said.andM;There is no way to build one interface to satisfy everyone, he said.andP;  &quot;Youhave to have a dynamic interface that can grow.&quot;andM;Cromp's ultimate goal is to build interface tools with which scienties invarious disciplines can design their own interfaces with ease.andP;  He pointedout that geologits and atmospheric scientiest speak in different vocabulariesand want different displays.andM;Cromp said an interface such as X Window, developed at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology, &quot;gives you all the hooks to build your own interfacebut requires a lot of work.andP;  We're building a tool kit to start shaping whatthe interface will look like.andP;  Then we'll keep abstracting until it becomesintuitive to the general user.&quot;andM;Although Cromp said he gets &quot;a little up-tight sometimes when I realize theamount of work that has to be done,&quot; he does feel he has a handle on thesolution.andP;  &quot;But we've got to convince other people our way will work,&quot; headded.andM;&quot;The only way is to do prototypes, publish, make yourself available forcritiquing and use that feedback.&quot;andM;Cromp spends several hours each day programming expert systems and developingdesigns for interfaces.andP;  He also speaks at international conference.andP;  &quot;I'mgood at pulling in a lot of information and explaining it to people in asimplified fashion,&quot; he said.andM;Future plans for his interface research include sound feedback, orsonification.andP;  &quot;You will be able to run a pointer through your data set andif it's noisy data such as water, you'll hear noise,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;If it's high elevation, it will give off a high pitch, while low-elevationdata will have a low pitch.andM;&quot;I imagine that in the next 10 to 15 years, people will be able to put on aheadset and talk to their computers with some basic commands and getfeedback.&quot;andM;Cromp is a part-time computer science instructor at the University ofMaryland.andP;  He began his research in artificial intelligence at the Universityof Buffalo and received a doctorate in computer science from Arizona StateUniversity.andP;  He became an AI researcher for a NASA contractor, then moved toNASA.andM;Although Cromp enjoys research, he said a move toward management will benatural for him because &quot;the more you get involved in an organization themore you have to remove yourself from the actual research.andP;  I feel I ampretty good at having a vision of where things should go, what's doable.&quot;andM;&quot;I still have a lot to learn.andP;  People have to be comfortable with you eitherbecause you established credibility by being around for a long time or elseyou published something impressive,&quot; Cromp said.andM;&quot;I'm in the beginning stages of all that.andP;  I still have to pay my dues beforepeople are going to come to me for solutions to major problems.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
