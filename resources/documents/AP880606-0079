The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that dismissed achallenge to the way some members are appointed to the Federal OpenMarket Committee.   The committee, part of the Federal Reserve System, directs thebuying and selling of government securities in the open market byFederal Reserve banks.   The committee's 12 members consist of the seven governors of theFederal Reserve Board and five representatives of Federal Reservebanks.   The Federal Reserve Board governors are appointed by thepresident with Senate approval. The five others are selectedannually by the boards of directors of the Reserve banks from amongthe banks' presidents and first vice presidents.   Melcher filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of howthe the five bank executives are named to the committee. He saidthey also should be subject to Senate confirmation.   The U.S. Court of Appeals threw out the suit last December. Thecourt said ruling on the merits of Melcher's claim would representundue judicial interference with the legislative process.   Any change in the appointment of committee members must be leftto Congress, the appeals court said, adding that similar challengesby other other senators met with a similar fate.   Melcher said the changing national and world economy has giventhe issue a greater urgency than ever. ``As the Federal Reservegrows in importance, so does the injury to this plaintiff in thedeprivation of his rightful, constitutional role in the selection ofthe officers who control it,'' he said.   The case is Melcher vs. Federal Open Market Committee, 87-1546.</TEXT></DOC>
