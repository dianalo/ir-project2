Profits are back, but not the corpulence that made easy pickingsof wage and benefit increases for the Steelworkers union in the twodecades before the 1982 collapse in steel.   ``I think there's going to be great efforts made to depict whatthe union does as a strategy. But my own hunch is there's going tobe a whole lot of improvising,'' said Ben Fischer, Carnegie MellonUniversity labor specialist and former USW presidential assistant.   The USW already has signaled its low regard for profit-sharing inlieu of raises. It rejected such an offer from Alcoa and Reynoldsand held out for a 50 cent-per-hour wage increase along with profitsharing, bonuses and pension increases from the aluminum industryleaders in December.   In addition, union leaders say privately that their relationswith LTV Corp., once unsurpassed among the major producers, havebeen soured by a dispute over $100 million in profit-sharingpayments the union claims.   Coordinated bargaining disintegrated in the industry's five-yeardepression, leaving the union to negotiate separately with eachcompany and in some cases with individual plants. Like theircorporate-manager counterparts, USW officials are fewer and busierthese days.   USX Corp., the nation's largest steelmaker, is sitting out thisround with a contract valid through January 1991, by which it canonly benefit if the competition has to endure a strike or increaselabor costs.   LTV, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. and the less influentialSharon Steel Corp. are still in reorganization under federalbankruptcy laws, and USW delegations there are standing in linealong with numerous other creditors for their piece of therestructured companies.   Fischer points out that steelmakers are developing close newrelations with customers, which force steel executives to representa new constituency when negotiating new labor contracts.   ``To the extent this is so, this is a tremendous pressure in thedirection of decentralization'' of labor relations, he said.   Moreover, maintaining lean new profiles will be high on theagenda of Bethlehem Steel Corp., Inland Steel Co., Armco Inc. andNational Steel Corp. the four producers that will enter talks toreplace contracts expiring July 31 for 45,900 USW members.   ``The steel companies have made good profits in 1988. They'llmake less in '89 in all likelihood...and of course what they do notwant to do is give away labor costs,'' said Donald F. Barnette, anindependent industry analyst.   ``Whatever you give away this year becomes a base for futureyears,'' he said.   President-elect George Bush has already said, without givingprecise details, that he will extend the steel import quotaslimiting foreign metal to roughly 20 percent of the U.S. market.Some economists see a consumer-led recession in 1988 that could workits way back up the production chain to basic manufacturing.   Barnett, for one, sees little more than a downturn in the steelmarket.   The consensus outlook, bright by comparison to the early 1980s,gives the USW the hope of negotiating its first raises in six years.   ``In economic terms, the industry is profitable. Our people havecontributed a great deal to that success and are entitled to sharein it,'' USW President Lynn Williams said.   USW members accepted back-to-back three-year contracts startingin 1983 that reduced wages and benefits by nearly $1.9 billion, asestimated by the USW using American Iron and Steel Institute data.The sacrifices amount to $4.5 billion when adjusted for inflation,according to the union.   Blue-collar employment plunged from around 175,000 workers in1983 to less than 126,000 by 1987, a period in which productioncapacity shrunk from 150 million tons to 112 million tons.   The 25 top producers that report to the American Iron and SteelInstitute, an industry trade group, expect 1988 operating profits of$2 billion or more.   ``Those numbers are not as big as they seem,'' said ThomasGraham, institute chairman and president of the steelmaking divisionof USX. ``The steel industry in 1988 earned a little under 10percent return on assets, below the average for other majorindustries.''   Steelmakers made $1 billion in 1987, after having lost $12billion in the industry's 1982-86 depression.   ``We proved from 1982 to 1986 that modernization investments,together with major cost-cutting programs, would pay off in terms ofhigher productivity, lower average production costs and improvedquality,'' Graham said.   ``Now our task is to consolidate those gains, to continueupgrading investments, (and) to repair the damage which those hugelosses have done to our companies through further improvedprofitability,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday Dec. 25</NOTE></DOC>
