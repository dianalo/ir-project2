Mechanical property changes by displacement damageswere studied and were related to microstructural evolutions with specialemphasis on interfacial structures. An increase of tensile strength andYoung's modulus of SiC/Al composite was observed by fast neutron irradiation.The SiC fibers showed the same tendency also by mixed spectrum neutronirradiation, but hot-pressed composites degraded mainly due to the degradationin interfacial strength and to matrix hardening. X-ray diffraction analysisand TEM observations of Ni ion irradiated specimens indicated microcrystalformation in SiC fibers which improved material responses. In-situ observationsin HVEM provided suppression of interfacial SiC crystal growth at elevatedtemperature, which is interpreted by another important mechanism of radiationeffect.</TEXT></DOC>
