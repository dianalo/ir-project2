Condensation in a plate fin tube heat exchanger placedin moist air atmosphere was studied under the condition of relativelylow propulsive force. The findings are as follows: The flow loss involvedin condensation is 30% to 40% higher than that with single phase becausecondensed water is present. Also, the apparent behavior of the condensedwater remaining in the heat exchange was simulated as a model representingchanges in the shape of the heat exchanger; the equivalent water filmthickness was calculated from the increase in flow loss. The resultsof this calculation almost agreed with the results of visual observation.When mass transfer was involved, the heat transfer rate was 20% higherthan that with single phase. Whthin the scope of this experiment, exactinganalogy does not hold. When mass transfer is involved, the ratio betweenthe heat transfer rate and mass transfer rate, h/h{sub 0}, is about 0.29W-h/(kg-K), suggesting an approximate Lewis relation.
