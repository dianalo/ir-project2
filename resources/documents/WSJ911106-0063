For a $1,000 contribution, he wrote, &quot;I'll send you,for your personal use, business cards identifying you as amember of the California Democratic Party's Finance Council.&quot;   &quot;P.S.,&quot; he concluded artfully, &quot;we have a few openings onmy Chairman's Council for those able to contribute $15,000 ormore annually.&quot;   Now, having stepped down as party chairman, what he'sdoing is running a third time for the Democratic presidentialnomination. And the message has changed.   &quot;This candidacy,&quot; he said in his announcement speechoutside Philadelphia's Independence Hall Oct. 21, &quot;rests on areal faith in the people. That is why I will not accept anycontribution over $100. If the corruption of political moneyis the issue, then the answer is, don't accept it.&quot; Thedemocratic process, he said, is being destroyed by &quot;an unholyalliance of private greed and corrupt politics.&quot;   Coming at a time of rising public disgust with thepolitical system, it is a powerful message. The question iswhether Mr. Brown is the right messenger. His critics say heis an opportunist. Mr. Brown replies, &quot;Being able to takeadvantage of opportunities is a characteristic of success inthis business.&quot;   Mr. Brown has some genuine core beliefs. Politicalconsistency is not among them. At age 53, the former two-termgovernor of California and presidential candidate remains abundle of contradictions -- almost childlike in his idealismone day, Machiavellian in his political calculations thenext.   &quot;There are two Jerry Browns,&quot; says California politicalcommentator Joe Scott. &quot;I like one of them; the other is thenice guy's evil twin, and these days the evil twin is incontrol.&quot;   &quot;Politics and religion are the main interests in my life,&quot;says Mr. Brown. His interest in politics was inherited fromhis genial father, Edmund G. &quot;Pat&quot; Brown, who was aproductive governor of California from 1959 to 1966 (when hesought a third term, and lost by a million votes to RonaldReagan). Jerry Brown's interest in religion stems from anadverse reaction to the politics he sometimes saw practicedby his father.   &quot;It all started back in the '40s,&quot; says Mr. Brown, &quot;whenmy father was district attorney {in San Francisco} and I wasfive years old. For whatever reason, you have a kid and youwant him to stand up and show them. Show them. Show them howyou talk. Show them how you walk. Smile. Show them how cuteyou are. Well, little boys don't want that usually. They wantsome assertion of independence.&quot;   &quot;He hates being a prop,&quot; says Tom Quinn, one of Mr.Brown's closest advisers in previous campaigns. &quot;To this day,he won't put a funny hat on for the cameras. He remembers hisfather wearing a sombrero.&quot;   Mr. Quinn has spent hours listening to Jerry Brown's talesabout the days when Pat Brown was governor, or running forgovernor. &quot;Jerry would be appalled as these big contributors-- cement contractors, say -- would be paraded in to see hisfather and his father would say, `Sure, we'll build a lotmore freeways. With cement.' And then they'd give him a fatcheck. Years later, Jerry would recall these stories and say,`This process is just wrong.'&quot;   &quot;My father,&quot; says Mr. Brown, &quot;is a very moral person.&quot;But, he concedes, &quot;I don't think he looked at campaign cashon the same level as I do.&quot; The relationship between fatherand son is &quot;complex&quot; but &quot;loving,&quot; friends say.   And so, &quot;partly in reaction&quot; to what his father was beingrequired to do, Mr. Brown hied himself to the Sacred HeartNovitiate in Los Gatos, where he spent three and a half yearsin hard study, hard work and contemplation, before decidinghe didn't choose to be a priest.   He left the novitiate and enrolled at the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley, graduating with majors in Latin andGreek, and added a law degree from Yale. He traveled throughSouth America for five months -- in pursuit of a girl he hadmet at school, says one of his male colleagues who first methim during that trip. Mr. Brown has shown up in the gossipcolumns by dating singer Linda Ronstadt and various moviestars; he has also dated, more seriously, a number ofnon-celebrities, but he has never been married.   He came home from South America to participate in theanti-Vietnam War movement, winning election as a conventiondelegate for Eugene McCarthy in 1968. The next year, for allhis apparent distaste for the profession, he embarked on aserious, calculated political career -- dedicated to winningback the office his father had lost -- by running for a seaton the Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees. Withone of the most famous names in the state -- formally, he isEdmund G. Brown Jr. -- he won easily.   He was elected secretary of state the next year, turning amoribund office into a high-visibility center for politicalreform. He was elected governor in 1974 and re-elected in alandslide in 1978. He presided over good times in California,allowing him to cut some taxes and earning him now thepraises of such a hard-line supply-side economist as ArthurLaffer, who says he was &quot;one of the best governors Californiaever had.&quot;   Mr. Brown won the hearts of environmentalists with big andsmall proposals -- from legislation to protect the coastlineto a measure to reduce the amount of water used by toiletsfrom seven gallons per flush to three-and-a-half.   He jumped into the contest for the Democratic presidentialnomination in 1976, typically late, typically unprepared. Buthe achieved surprising success, winning primaries inCalifornia, Maryland and Nevada. He ran again in 1980, butwas never a serious factor. And his 1982 Senate campaignagainst Republican Pete Wilson, now the governor ofCalifornia, was embarrassingly inept.   Through it all, he developed -- perhaps even nurtured -- areputation for eccentricity. It is his minimalist life style-- sometimes stage-managed for political effect -- and hisassociation with a series of philosophers, gurus andcutting-edge religious and political counselers that hashelped to earn him the nickname, &quot;Moonbeam,&quot; that shadows himeverywhere he goes.   An intensely curious man, Mr. Brown tends to be attractedto people with new and striking ideas. &quot;These people becomesoul mates,&quot; says an old friend who prefers to remainanonymous, &quot;and Jerry will narrowly focus on them from timeto time.&quot; The result can be anything from a lecture about thedangers facing Spaceship Earth, a concept borrowed fromBuckminster Fuller, to the need to recognize that &quot;small isbeautiful,&quot; a slow-growth notion fathered by E.F. Schumacher.   Mr. Brown once spent five months in Cuernavaca, Mexico, atthe Center for Intercultural Documentation listening to thethoughts of theologian Ivan Illich. He argued all night withfuturist Herman Kahn. He is enthralled by anthropologistGregory Bateson's double-bind theory on schizophrenia. He hastraveled to India to work with Mother Teresa. He grew a beardand spent several months studying Zen meditation in aCatholic monastery near Tokyo.   He has tried to write a book summing up all theseexperiences. &quot;It's in my computer,&quot; he says, &quot;a couple ofmegabytes long. What it needs is heavy editing.&quot;   By jumping from one fixation to another, Mr. Brown appearsto traditional thinkers to be a man who is erratic andinconsistent.   &quot;With most politicians,&quot; says political consultant GeorgeCappannelli, &quot;it's ready, aim, fire. The way Jerry doesthings, it's fire, aim, ready.&quot; Mr. Cappannelli was managerof Mr. Brown's shortlived Senate campaign earlier this year;it was dumped in favor of the presidential effort.   In this low-budget presidential campaign, Mr. Brown's soulmate is Patrick Caddell, who was Jimmy Carter's pollster andwho has spent recent years wandering in political exileseeking a candidate who would run as an &quot;outsider&quot; to thecheers of angry voters appalled by the greed and incompetenceof Washington &quot;insiders.&quot; Mr. Brown, always entranced bypolitical gimmicks, recognizes the impact this kind ofmessage could have with voters this year.   Several of Mr. Brown's closest advisers -- Mr. Quinn andpolitical consultant Richard Maullin chief among them -- aretaking no part in this campaign, convinced of itsimpracticality. But they aren't surprised Mr. Caddell isinvolved. &quot;Pat has a lot of free time,&quot; says Mr. Quinn. &quot;He'savailable.&quot;   But, for all the &quot;moonbeam&quot; diversions, there are someconsistent strands in Mr. Brown's thinking. His distaste formaterialistic excesses in the life of the individual and inthe life of the nation is genuine. He lives simply, turningover basic everyday decisions to a longtime associate, theelusive French-born, oft-married Jacques Barzaghi, who picksthe clothes for Mr. Brown to wear, tells him whom to talk to-- and whom not to talk to -- and delivers bad news to peopleMr. Brown would prefer to avoid.   Unlike most politicians, Mr. Brown listens; he is open tofresh ideas. &quot;His intellect is phenomenal,&quot; says Dee Hensch,a Los Angeles lawyer who served as Mr. Brown's executivedirector for several months when he was state party chairman.&quot;His willingness to examine himself is very rare.&quot;   Mr. Brown admits he's having a wonderful time runningagain for president, warming himself in the glow of the TVlights and the cheering crowds of admirers reacting to hisanti-politics message.   It's a refreshing change from that awful two years hespent as party chairman. But that chairmanship tells a lotabout Jerry Brown.   &quot;I don't know why I took the job,&quot; he says. &quot;I wanted toget back into politics. I wanted to -- how the hell can I saythis? -- I wanted to serve the party. I wanted to help buildit and earn the respect of my political peers.&quot;   The first thing he did was cut a deal with Sen. AlanCranston. &quot;It was a condition of his support {for Mr. Brown'sbid to be state chairman} that I would hire Marshall Ganz asmy political director.&quot;   The match between Mr. Ganz, who had been the grass rootsorganizer for Sen. Cranston's extensive political operation,and the freewheeling Mr. Brown, who has never thought much ofplanning processes, wasn't a perfect fit. Mr. Ganz designedwhat he calls &quot;a massive program to revitalize the CaliforniaDemocratic Party at its base.&quot; He hired workers, wrote amanual, conducted successful pilot projects. &quot;And, after allthat, Jerry Brown told me he couldn't pay for it. So nothinghappened. We had no registration drive at all, noget-out-the-vote effort. If we had done our job, DianneFeinstein&quot; -- Mr. Wilson's 1990 Democratic opponent -- &quot;wouldbe governor today.&quot;   &quot;He wanted to spend $7 million,&quot; counters Mr. Brown. &quot;WhatI learned is, there is no way. The game is money. It's anunlimited sum of money you're being asked for, and theresimply isn't enough money in the world to buy back thedisappearing loyalty of the Democratic constituency.&quot;   Mr. Brown says being chairman was &quot;a very stressfulexperience. I gained about 30 pounds. The job of a politicianis to eat and drink. That's your function.&quot;   So he quit. In an attempt to deal with the stress, hebooked himself into a Trappist monastery in Vina, near Chico.&quot;It's a way,&quot; he says, &quot;to restore one's recollection.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
