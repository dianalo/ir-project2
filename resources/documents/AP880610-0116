The decision will be sent to Capitol Hill imminently, givingCongress 50 days to approve or reject the sale, which could includethe transfer of up to 40 F-18s, according to an official who spokeon condition of anonymity.   The administration wants to sell jets to Kuwait to help thatoil-rich gulf state defend against strikes by combatants in the7-year-old Iran-Iraq War.   Congressional opposition is possible, however, from members whohave noted that Kuwait, like other Arab nations, is technically ina state of war with Israel. Some congressmen have also expressedconcern that selling advanced weapons to countries in the PersianGulf will increase tensions in the region.   The official said administration representatives met privatelyon Thursday with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committeeto explain the proposed sale.   State Department spokesmen said last month that theadministration favored the sale of advanced jets to Kuwait but hadnot decided whether to ask Congress to approve the transfer ofF-18s, or less powerful F-16s or F-15s.   F-18s have been specially designed for equal effectiveness asfighters and bombers. The F-15, the Air Force's hottest fighter, isused mostly as an interceptor against other aircraft. The F-16 hasdual capabilities as a fighter and bomber, but according toadministration experts the F-18 can switch fighter-bomber rolesmore quickly than the F-16.   Only Australia, Canada and Spain _ all formal allies of theUnited States _ have been permitted to buy F-18s.   The official speaking today said the decision was made to pickF-18s. If Kuwait purchases all 40 planes authorized, the contractwould be worth $1 billion to the manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas.   In the international arms market, the company competes heavilywith the French makers of the Mirage 2000 jet and administrationofficials are eager to see an American concern get the Kuwaiticontract.   Kuwait reportedly also wants to purchase weapons the F-18 cancarry in its arsenal: Maverick air-to-ground missiles, air-to-airSidewinder missiles and Harpoon anti-ship missiles.</TEXT></DOC>
