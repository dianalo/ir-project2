The owner and licenser of video cassette stores said proceeds will be used to open additional stores, for possible acquisitions and for general purposes.    Under Blockbuster's plan to sell 1,263,348 shares in three stages to a Fort Lauderdale investment group, 384,615 shares are to be sold today, with a second sale covering the same number of shares to be completed within six months and the rest of the transaction within 18 months. The group will be obligated to make the third purchase if the market price of the company's common is $17 a share or more at the time.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Blockbuster's common closed at $17.50 a share, up $2.125.    The company said it also will issue five-year warrants to the investor group to buy 850,000 common shares at $17 each and warrants for another 850,000 common shares at $21 a share.    Blockbuster said three members of the investment group will be named to its board after the first stock purchase, expanding the board to six. After the second purchase, the group may name an additional director, Blockbuster said. </TEXT></DOC>
