Hundreds more refugees arrived in West Germany today, confoundingexpectations that the stream of people would slow to a trickle afterthe initial wave earlier this week.   Officials said Friday that about 14,000 refugees had arrivedsince midnight Sunday, when Hungary decided to empty its crowdedrefugee camps by opening its border with Austria and allowing theEast Germans to leave without their government's permission.   Hungary coordinated the exodus with West Germany, where EastGermans automatically gain citizenship.   Communist East Germany bitterly denounced its Warsaw Pact allyand demanded that Hungary close its border. Hungary, however, saidthat allowing East Germans passage to the West was in line withsocial and political reforms it is carrying out.   Hungary began dismantling its border barriers with Austria in Mayand 10,000 East Germans escaped illegally prior to this week'scrossings.   West German counterintelligence officials said Friday they wereworried that Communist East Germany may have slipped a few spiesamong the refugees. They promised help to any spies who turnedthemselves in.   A surge of crossings Thursday followed news reports that Hungarywould soon close the border.   But comments by Hungarian officials Friday appeared calculated todispel such fears. Government spokesman Zsolt Bajnok said there hadbeen no decision on when the border would be closed.   Most of the refugees are young, educated and skilled people, andthey have left a gaping hole in East Germany's work force.   East German Central Committee member Harry Tisch said Friday thegoverment will have to find solutions ``to bridge this gap.''   ``It certainly won't be easy,'' Tisch said during a visit toStuttgart. ``Naturally, it's not unproblematical for us that skilledworkers, whether young or old, from the German Democratic Republicare resettling in the Federal Republic of Germany.''   According to statistics released Thursday by the West Germangovernment, East Germany is suffering its biggest talent drain fromthe nation's work force since the Berlin Wall went up in 1961.   Several times in the past few days, West German Chancellor HelmutKohl has urged the East German leadership to make political andeconomic reforms to curb the flow of refugees.   But Guenter Mittag, the Central Committee member in charge of theEast German economy, rejected those calls in a commentary Friday inthe Communist Party daily newspaper Neues Deutschland.   ``The reform proposals of those people contain only one point:They want the type of reform that does away with Socialism,'' Mittagwrote. ``Thanks a lot for that. It just won't be that way!''   In Bonn, the Foreign Ministry said 60 East Germans demanding toemigrate were holed up at the West German Embassy in Warsaw, Poland,and 170 at the embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.   There was little hope they would gain passage to the West,however. Polish leaders have urged caution in the matter, and Praguehas refused to sanction their departure.</TEXT></DOC>
