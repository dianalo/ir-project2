(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rev. Jerry Falwell on Thursday likenedthe TV evangelism scandals with the Watergate affair and said ``thecause of Christ is better off'' because of them.   The crisis that ended the Nixon administration ``made it muchtougher for politicians since then,'' Falwell told the NationalAssociation of Evangelicals.   ``In the days ahead, it is going to be tougher for national(ministry) leaders to misbehave,'' he said. ``Not impossible, buttougher.''   Falwell, a fundamentalist preacher who is not a member of theassociation, appeared for the first time before the group, whichhas 50,000 members and represents 72 denominations.   An admission of sin last month by TV preacher Jimmy Swaggart andallegations last year of sexual and financial misconduct by JimBakker have led to a new code of moral and financial ethics forreligious broadcasters, Fallwell said.   ``I think the days of the Rolls-Royces and Rolexes ... the daysin which social status is gauged by financial trappings, areover,'' Falwell said at a luncheon sponsored by the NationalReligious Broadcasters, an affiliate of the NAE.   Falwell said that the Swaggart controversy had had little effecton his own ministry and that he did not believe it had equaled thegeneral impact of the Bakker revelations on the religious broadcastindustry.   ``It seems that all the fallout that was going to occur,occurred last year,'' he said at a news conference after theluncheon.   However, he said that if similar scandals had occurred to him orother, more conservative, ministers, ``we would be out looking forother employment.''   ``I'd rather be dead'' than be immoral, he said.   Bakker, who admitted a tryst with a church secretary and who hasbeen accused of financial improprieties, was expelled from theAssemblies of God church.   Swaggart, who has been accused of paying a prostitute to performlewd acts, was suspended by the denomination and expects to returnto the pulpit.   After Bakker resigned as head of PTL, Falwell headed theministry for several months before stepping aside.   Falwell accepted an invitation to speak before the NAE in 1983but withdrew after criticism from fellow fundamentalists. Thefundamentalist side of Protestant Christianity maintains atheological separation from the more broadly based evangelicalorganization.   Falwell's ``Old Time Gospel Hour'' is broadcast around the worldon some 350 television stations. He is founder of the MoralMajority movement and pastor of the 21,000-member Thomas RoadBaptist Church in Lynchburg, Va., the largest in the country.   Turning to politics, Falwell praised former religiousbroadcaster Pat Robertson but said he endorsed George Bush for thepresidency, even though Falwell had Ronald Reagan not to chooseBush as his vice president.   ``I'd love to see a Bush-Kemp ticket,'' he said referring to NewYork congressman Jack Kemp.   On the other side, Falwell said, ``I can't think of a singleDemocrat running this year who I could hold my nose and vote for.''   In a presidential preference poll conducted late Wednesday, some100 NAE board members endorsed Bush, followed by Kansas Sen. RobertDole, Kemp and Robertson. Among Democrats, they favored Rep.Richard Gephardt of Missouri.   The last-place finish for Robertson ``confounded conventionalwisdom that he would be the near-unanimous choice of evangelicalleaders,'' said Richard Cizik, research director for the NAE inWashington.   But it was no surprise to those trying to gauge the support forRobertson within the evangelical movement over the past two years.In two previous polls, its leaders also placed Robertson fourthamong the GOP candidates.   ``They just don't consider Robertson to be the most qualifiedfor the job,'' Cizik said.   Among Democrats, Gephardt was slightly favored over Sen. AlbertGore of Tennessee, with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Sen.Paul Simon of Illinois and Jackson, a Baptist minister, trailing inthat order.   Bush received 40 percent of the votes on the GOP side. Dole got32 percent, Kemp 17 percent and Robertson 12 percent.   Gephardt was ranked first among Democrats by 37 percent of theboard members. Gore received 33 percent, Dukakis 16 percent, Simon11 percent and Jackson 5 percent.   In two previous two polls, in March and October last year, Dolewas the winner with more than 40 percent of the votes, followed byKemp, Bush and Robertson.   Although evangelicals are considered conservative and orthodoxin their religious views, they represent a broad spectrum ofpolitical ideology and the board members are ``not necessarily areflection of the rank and file,'' said Cizik.   The NAE, conducting a series of workshops and seminars for some500 delegates, includes denominations as diverse as Reformed andPentecostal. Among its members are Baptists, Lutherans,Presbyterians and Mennonites.</TEXT></DOC>
