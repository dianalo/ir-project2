He didn't succeed, according to governmentprosecutors, but Presser breathed new life into the nation'slargest union, returned it to the mainstream of the American labormovement and, just maybe, helped put it on a path towards reform.   Presser, 61, died Saturday night at a suburban Clevelandhospital after a battle with cancer, two months after giving up thereins of the 1.6-million-member union to Weldon Mathis, the No. 2official and Presser's apparent choice as his successor.   While Presser himself had been the subject of 14 criminalinvestigations and was under indictment when he died, his moves toput Mathis in control were consistent with a career-long effort torepair the Teamsters' image.   Mathis, 62, has never been linked with any organized crimefigures. And except for nepotism that is common to many unions, heis free of scandal.   Presser had initiated a change in the union's constitution in1986 so that Mathis, rather than First Vice President JosephTrerotola of New York, would become interim president.   Trerotola, 70, has never been indicted. But many of the hundredsof local Teamster officials that prosecutors have pursued over thepast dozen years have been under his jurisdiction as head of theunion's Eastern Conference in New York and New Jersey.   Mathis was empowered as the Teamsters' acting president for 120days or until early September. Starting out as a business agent fora Teamster local in Atlanta, he climbed his way through the union'shierarchy over 38 years.   When Presser passed the reins to Mathis on an interim basis,Trerotola led a boycott by half of the 16 executive board membersat the first meeting convened afterwards, setting up a possiblechallenge to him.   No permanent successor to Presser will be chosen until after hisfuneral Tuesday, labor officials said. But labor insiders doubt asuccessful challenge to Mathis can be mounted.   ``Jackie may have decided it when he yielded the power for fourmonths,'' one source said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.   Walter Shea, the Teamster's chief policy operative in Washingtonwith the soft-spoken demeanor of a State Department diplomat, issaid by union insiders to have the most support for challengingMathis.   Several other of the 16 union vice presidents also would likethe job, although the only ones with sufficient support formounting a challenge are Joseph Morgan of Hallandale, Fla., andArnie Weinmeister of Seattle, according to sources in the union.   Based on who attended the May meeting that Mathis convened inArizona, he is still believed to have the necessary nine-votemajority, including his own, for winning the top job.   The only way he could be denied the union presidency would be ifall his potential rivals united behind a single challenger.``That's the big question,'' said one Teamster insider.   Presser died just two weeks after the government, in afirst-ever suit of its kind, moved to place control of the entireunion under a court-appointed trustee.   Among the government's claims were that Presser, Mathis and theTeamsters' 16 board members were controlled by organized crime or,at best, unwilling or incapable of removing the Cosa Nostra'sdomination over the union's affairs the past three decades.   Presser denied ever being under mob control, but it was a fineline that he walked, remembering the disappearance of formerTeamsters chief Jimmy Hoffa after his release from jail and bid toreassume control of the union.   ``If you're totally honest and try to clean up the union and youtry to do it fast enough and without making accommodations so thegovernment won't get you, the other guys _ the hoods _ will getyou,'' he said of the Teamsters' presidency in a 1977 interview.``It's a death chair either way.''   Despite Presser's death, the government will pursue its takeoversuit, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani of New York said Sunday.   Presser himself was under indictment for allegedly participatingin a ghost employee payroll-padding in which some $700,000 from aCleveland Teamsters local that he also headed was funneled toorganized crime figures.   Armed with reams of government documents showing Presser to havebeen an informant for both the FBI and the Internal RevenueService, his attorneys had prepared an elaborate defense on thepremise that any wrongdoing was done under the auspices of thegovernment.   Altogether during his 40-year union career, Presser was thesubject of at least 14 criminal probes. But unlike past Teamsterchiefs given the same scrutiny, Presser believed in using publicrelations to counter the union's image as corrupt.   As an Ohio Teamster leader during the early 1970s, Presser waswidely credited with reducing the power of organized crime figuresthrough his own aggressiveness in contract bargaining. And in 1977he persuaded then-Teamster President Frank Fitzsimmons to establisha large public relations apparatus and put him in charge of it.   Taking over as president in 1983, Presser immediately began topolish the international union's image. He was the first Teamsterpresident in modern times to testify voluntarily before acongressional committee.   Presser promised senators he would try to cleanse the union ofcorrupt influences but cautioned ``there's no way I can be apoliceman.''   Earlier this month, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the rankingRepublican on the Senate Labor Committee, credited Presser withbringing ``honorable'' people into the union's hierarchy andhelping clean up the Central States Pension Plan.   ``Mr. Presser, regardless of what anybody else may think of him,has lived up to every promise he made to me,'' Hatch said. ``Thereis no one person who can straighten it all out.''   Last year, while convalescing from cancer treatments, Presserguided the Teamsters back into the AFL-CIO after 30 years of bitterrivalry between the two groups.   He turned the Teamsters' political action fund into the biggestcampaign chest of any group in the country, and the computernetwork he purchased to keep financial tabs on every company with aTeamsters contract is the most sophisticated in the labor movement.   Presser also replaced much of the union's headquarters staffthat had grown moribund under Hoffa's successors, Fitzsimmons andRoy Williams.   ``Fitzsimmons was on the golf course all the time and Williamsstayed in Kansas City,'' one veteran Teamster official recalled.``Jackie came in and started taking names. He wanted to knoweverything that was going on. All of a sudden the Teamsters were aunion again.''</TEXT></DOC>
