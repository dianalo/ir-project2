The hijackers, whose identity and nationality are not known,have made the same demand as the Americans' captors _ freedom for17 pro-Iranian extremists jailed in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. andFrench embassies there in 1983.   Kuwait, a tiny oil-rich desert emirate trapped in the crossfireof the Iran-Iraq war, has doggedly refused to free any of them. Itreiterated Tuesday that it will not bow to ``blackmail.''   Like Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland, the two Americansheld captive in Lebanon since 1985, the passengers and crew membersheld hostage aboard Kuwait Airways Flight 422 have become pawns ina war between the acolytes of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini andopponents of his Islamic revolution.   Kuwait, like most of Iran's Persian Gulf Arab neighbors, is aconservative state ruled by Sunni Moslems, historic rivals of theShiite sect who make up the vast majority of Iran's 50 millionpeople.   Like other Arab states, Kuwait fears that Iran's fundamentalistIslamic revolution will spread its way, inciting its Shiiteminority into insurrection.   Galvanized by Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and Khomeini'srevolution, Lebanon's long-downtrodden Shiites launched suicidebombings against the Israelis and later U.S. and French troops whotook part in an ill-fated multinational peacekeeping force inLebanon.   In the past five years, Shiite extremists have particularlytargeted Kuwait, which Iran accuses of aiding Iraq in the PersianGulf war.   The 17 people whose release the hijackers demand were convictedof a wave of bombings in 1983 that killed five people and wounded86 and culminated in attacks on the U.S. and French embassies inKuwait.   Later terrorist attacks on Kuwait included an abortive 1985assassination attempt on the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah.   Three of the 17 were sentenced to death _ two Iraqis, BaqerIbrahim Abdel-Reda and Hussein Qassem Hassan, and a Lebanese namedas Elias Fuad Saab.   The Shiite kidnappers in Lebanon are particularly interested inspringing Saab because he is a cousin of Imad Mugniyeh, who Westernand Lebanese intelligence believe to be the mastermind of IslamicJihad, or Holy War, and other extremist Shiite factions behind achain of suicide bombings, kidnappings and aircraft hijackings inrecent years.   Saab's real name is Mustafa Youssef, and Western intelligenceofficials believe he rigged the bombs used in the Kuwait attacks.   Kuwait has so far not carried out the death sentences handeddown on Youssef and his fellow bombers, apparently after appealsfrom Washington.   But that appears to have been its only concession. Scores ofother Shiites have been arrested for sabotage since 1983. In 1985,Kuwait's now-suspended Parliament passed a law decreeing capitalpunishment for using explosives to kill or cause terror, and lifeimprisonment for possessing explosives.   Mugniyeh, 36, is a key figure in the security apparatus ofHezbollah, or Party of God, an Iranian-backed Shiite movementbelieved to be the umbrella for factions holding most of the 22foreign hostages in Lebanon.   His family has been closely linked for many years with theHamadis, another Shiite clan deeply involved in kidnappings.   Both clans are from the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.   Mugniyeh and Mohammed Ali Hamadi, held in West Germany oncharges of smuggling explosives, have been named by U.S.authorities as two of the four Lebanese Shiites involved in theJune 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner in which U.S. Navy diverRobert Dean Stethem was killed.   The Hamadis, using various cover names, allegedly kidnappedthree West Germans in Beirut in an effort to force Bonn to freeMohammed and one of his brothers, Abbas, who is currently on trialin Duesseldorf for kidnapping two Germans. A third Hamadi brother,Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, the linchpin of the clan, is Hezbollah'ssecurity chief.   The Mugniyehs are thought to have kidnapped Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press. Seized March16, 1985, Anderson is the longest held of the missing foreigners.</TEXT></DOC>
