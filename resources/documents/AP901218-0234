A recession, higher oil prices, sagging real estate markets andgrowing corporate debt put the industry in more red ink over thepast year. Many were forced to tighten lending, cut dividends, layoff staff and restructure operations to stay afloat.   ``I'd say the banking industry is probably overall in the worstshape it's been since we've been rating banks in the early 1970s,''said Christopher Mahoney, a banking analyst for Moody's InvestorsService in New York. ``We have more troubled banks, more largetroubled banks, than ever before.''   While others agree, they say current problems aren't likely toescalate into another savings and loan fiasco. Nor are they makingmany comparisons to the 1930s, when the list of bank failures wasas long as bread lines.   In fact, some say a healthy dose of cost-cutting and lendingdiscipline could rejuvenate the industry.   ``We have weathered this kind of storm before and we willweather this one as well,'' Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady saidrecently.   Stephen Berman, banking analyst with County Securities USA inNew York, agreed: ``This is a troubled industry coming to gripswith its problems.   ``They're establishing reserves for the (weak) real estatecycle, which will cause losses this year and next year. (But) theywill be stronger.''   Experts recall the real estate recession in the mid-70s, thecollapse of the oil states and the rust and farm belts a few yearslater, and the Third World debt crisis in the last decade.   Banks dumped billions of dollars into special reserves to coverlosses from developing countries, whose deteriorating economiesforced them to put off or halt bank loan payments. By the start of1990, big banks had amassed reserves to cover, on average, abouthalf their total loan exposure, according to a Moody's report.   Just as they did with Third World debt, banks have set upreserves or written off troubled real estate loans.   By Sept. 30, these loans made up 61 percent of the nonperformingloans of 23 large bank holding companies studied byPrudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. Loans that arenonperforming may be delinquent or in default.   During the third quarter, bank earnings slid 29 percent over theprevious quarter, according to the latest data from the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp., itself under financial strain.   The FDIC report noted, however, that 89 percent of the nation's12,400 commercial banks made money in the quarter and that themoney losers were largely comprised of banks in therecession-plagued Northeast. But it said that was likely to changeby 1991 as more banks, particularly on the West Coast, reportproblems with real estate loans.   Two-thirds of the nation's loan officers admitted to tighteninglending standards on construction and land development loans, arecent Federal Reserve survey found. About a quarter restrictedcredit for residential mortgages by requiring higher down paymentsand bigger household incomes.   ``Consumers can still get money, unless they'reover-leveraged,'' County Securities' Berman said.   Overleveraging, or piling up more debt than one can easilyhandle, was the name of the game during the '80s, and banks wereall too eager to accommodate the binge. But the buying spree endedas the economy worsened.   ``Banks are recognizing that maybe they did go beyond the boundsof conservative lending,'' said Charles J. Orabutt, a vicepresident at Duff and Phelps Inc. in Chicago.   Bad loans from highly leveraged transactions made up 12 percentof the nonperforming loans of the 23 banks surveyed byPrudential-Bache in the third quarter. Some experts predict that asmany as 20 percent of highly leveraged companies will require someform of debt restructuring.   Chase Manhattan Corp. charged off $35 million of a loan to anunnamed ``highly leveraged corporate borrower'' in the thirdquarter. Analysts believe it was a reference to cash-strappeddeveloper and casino owner Donald Trump, who restructured some ofhis bank loans.   Banks scaled back foreign operations while consolidating andstrengthening domestically to save money and to meet stricterstandards for capital reserves, which take full effect in 1993.   Citicorp, for instance, announced a major reorganization justbefore the holidays that included laying off as many as 8,000employees and cutting its dividend to shareholders by 44 percent.The nation's largest bank also decided to close two-thirds of itscommercial real estate and corporate banking offices in NorthAmerica.   Security Pacific Corp. eliminated its entire merchant bankingdivision, which lent money to large corporations and underwrotesecurities overseas.   Chase reduced its staff by about 5,000 and halved its dividend,while Chemical Banking Corp. slashed its dividend 63 percent.   ``Through the 1990s we'll see most banking companies concentrateon establishing strong domestic operations,'' said Robert Dugger,chief economist for the American Bankers Association trade group.   Dugger also predicted more bank marriages of convenience.   ``I suspect there will be many mergers of banks to economize ontheir operations - interstate and intrastate - and improveprofitability,'' he said. ``This consolidation process willcontinue through the 1990s.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
