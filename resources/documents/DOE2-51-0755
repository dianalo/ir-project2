The present paper is concerned with experimental study onself-oscillator SHF supply system for linear resonance electron acceleratorswith its synchronization by external low-power SHF generator, that permitsto increase stability of oscillation frequency. A 10-cm range powerfulklystron pulse amplifier is investigated. Measurements of oscillationfrequency with different values of synchronizing oscillator frequencywere carried out in course of experiment. Analysis of obtained experimentalresults shows that use of synchronized powerful klystron self-oscillatorpermits to improve frequency characteristics of the accelerator SHF-supplysystem and makes it possible to carry out a series of in-beam experimentsrequiring high stability of the bunch repetition frequency or its changeaccording to a definite law within the synchronization band limits. 2refs.; 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
