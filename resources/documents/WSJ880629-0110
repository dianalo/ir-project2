Chinese eyewitnesses said the police, estimated to number 6,000, beat and arrested many of the 1,000 farmers who gathered in Fangshan county on June 21 to protest a government plan to release industrially polluted water from a local reservoir that the farmers said would harm their crops. Three farmers were killed in the clash, the witnesses reported.    Earlier this month, police in Beijing were massed to prevent students from holding a sit-in on human rights. Already unnerved by widespread grumbling over rapidly rising food prices, officials believed that allowing the student rally would prompt other groups to demonstrate, resulting in general instability.    The Fangshan government played down last week's incident. &quot;A small number of people pressed demands that the government couldn't allow,&quot; said Wang Zuosheng, Communist Party secretary of the district. &quot;We handled the troublemakers according to the law.&quot; He denied that anyone had been injured or arrested, contradicting several eyewitness accounts.    After the demonstration was broken up, the government proceeded with its plans to release the water. The government says it will provide cash and supplies of flour to local residents to compensate for losses caused by the polluted water. </TEXT></DOC>
