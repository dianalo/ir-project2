The proposed acquisition, valued at $512.5 million, is subject to approval by U.S. Leasing's shareholders.    Various issues of the San Francisco-based company's debt are included in the agencies' review, including single-A-minus rated senior debt, single-A senior debt, and some of the debt of its U.S. Leasing Corp. unit.    Sandamp;P said about $440 million of long-term debt is involved, adding that Ford's debt wasn't affected by the announcement.    Sandamp;P said it was considering the impact of the offer on U.S. Leasing's creditworthiness. Moody's said it was focusing on the shareholder response, the potential for additional suitors, and the standing of existing debtholders once an agreement is completed. </TEXT></DOC>
