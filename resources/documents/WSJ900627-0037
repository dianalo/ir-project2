White House Chief of Staff John Sununu insisted privatelyto Senate Republicans that the president hadn't said anythingnew. But Mr. Bush's intended audience, top congressionalDemocrats, heard the president say the words they had beenwaiting for, and they pledged to begin serious negotiationspromptly toward a deficit-reduction compromise.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The president has concluded that tax increases arenecessary,&quot; said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D.,Maine). &quot;We share the president's view.&quot;   The president's comments came in a statement the WhiteHouse released after Mr. Bush hosted a two-hour breakfastwith congressional leaders. He said, &quot;It is clear to me thatboth the size of the deficit problem and the need for apackage that can be enacted require all of the following:entitlement and mandatory program reform; tax revenueincreases; growth incentives; discretionary spendingreductions; orderly reductions in defense expenditures; andbudget process reform.&quot;   Republicans ranging from Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, atax foe, to Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, who has drafteda plan that calls for higher consumption taxes, later saidMr. Bush was simply restating what he has said previously.But Sen. Mitchell described Mr. Bush's statement as &quot;clearand unambiguous&quot; and &quot;new and significant.&quot;   Congressional Democrats tried not to gloat publicly, butprivately they were jubilant that their tactic ofstonewalling in the budget negotiations produced what theyviewed as a significant concession from the president.   &quot;Sometimes you're not able to get to the substance untilyou cure a political problem, and only he {Mr. Bush} couldcure the political problem,&quot; said Sen. Wyche Fowler (D.,Ga.). &quot;The great drawbridge has been let down by thepresident, and now we ought to scramble out of the castleinto the fray.&quot;   Summit negotiators said new deficit-reduction proposalsmay surface this week, perhaps as early as today, when thetalks are scheduled to resume. House Majority Leader RichardGephardt (D., Mo.) said House Democrats are drafting a planthat would cut the projected deficit by $50 billion nextyear. They're likely to rely on deep cuts in defensespending.   The senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, Sen.Domenici, has been circulating a $50 billion plan that wouldraise taxes about $24 billion next year, cut spending ongovernment benefit programs, known as entitlements, about $10billion and cut other programs.   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said there is&quot;a tacit understanding&quot; among budget negotiators to reach anagreement by mid-July. Senate Budget Committee Chairman JamesSasser (D., Tenn.) said all sides hope for an agreementbefore Congress has to vote on raising the federal debtceiling in late July or early August.   Despite the new enthusiasm, negotiators are far fromagreement on exactly what taxes to raise, what spending tocut and how to alter the budget process. Administrationofficials noted that Mr. Bush stressed in his statement theneed for &quot;budget process reform to assure that any bipartisanagreement is enforceable.&quot;   &quot;We're now on the 20-yard line,&quot; Sen Dole said. &quot;Only 80yards left to go.&quot;   Political analysts said Mr. Bush probably won't be hurt byabandoning his memorable campaign promise. &quot;The publicrecognizes he is breaking his pledge; there is no ambiguity,&quot;said Democratic pollster Peter Hart. But when voters areasked what difference that makes, Mr. Hart added, most reply:&quot;Hey, it really doesn't make any difference.&quot;   According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll lastmonth, 89% of Americans thought a federal tax increase wasvery likely or somewhat likely. Moreover, resistance tohigher taxes seems to be waning. In April, voters opposed anytax increases 57% to 39%. A month later, they divided 48% to48%. And when asked in the latest survey whether they wouldrather live with the current federal budget deficit or taxincreases, voters opted for raising taxes by a 49% to 43%margin.   But while the president may be politically safe, otherRepublicans stand to lose a valuable political weapon, andthey were showing their pain. &quot;The White House has caved intoo quickly on tax increases,&quot; complained Rep. Chuck Douglas(R., N.H.). With communism crumbling, Cold War rhetoric haslost its bite, and some Republicans see the tax issue as themost significant difference between them and Democrats.   Republican pollster Linda DiVall said, &quot;This is not onlygoing to make some Republicans very uncomfortable, it's alsogoing to force some of them to draw distinctions betweenthemselves and the president.&quot; Indeed, Rep. Robert Walker(R., Pa.) quickly got 90 of the 176 House Republicans to signa letter to the president that said flatly, &quot;We were stunnedby your announcement. . . . A tax increase in unacceptable.&quot;   As long as the issue was simply whether to raise taxes,political analysts say Republicans had a clear politicalwinner. But that issue is slipping away. &quot;Someone who iscomplaining about taxes being raised in the budget summitwill have to complain against both parties and thepresident,&quot; said Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.)   As the issue shifts to which taxes to raise, analysts sayDemocrats may have an edge if they can succeed in paintingthe president and other Republicans as reluctant to tax therich and eager to tax middle-income Americans.   Whatever the political ramifications, Mr. Bush succeededin getting the budget summit back on track. In their firstsix weeks, the talks had accomplished nothing. Democrats weredivided, and those who distrusted the administration wereblocking progress.   Trying to salvage the summit, Budget Director RichardDarman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady held separatemeetings last week and early this week with influentialDemocrats, including Speaker Foley, Sen. Mitchell, and thechairmen of the House and Senate tax-writing panels, Sen.Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois.Mr. Darman also spent two hours with Rep. Gephardt yesterday.   All the Democrats stressed how important it was for Mr.Bush to get personally involved, but aides said none of themwere certain what Mr. Bush would tell the congressionalleaders over the breakfast.   A White House official said that after an hour with Mr.Bush, the Democrats urged the president to address the taxissue publicly. &quot;They said, `We want a more publicadmission,'&quot; the official said. &quot;Bush said, `OK, let's talkabout it.'&quot;   It took another hour, with occasional breaks to wait forphotocopies to be made, for the participants to agree on thewording of Mr. Bush's statement. Each word was weighed. Acongressional source said a White House draft of the keysentence began, &quot;It is clear that. . . .&quot; Democrats insistedit say, &quot;It is clear to me that. . . .&quot;   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater refused toconcede that Mr. Bush had repudiated his campaign promise.And at a meeting with Senate Republicans, Mr. Sununu arguedthat Mr. Bush hadn't done anything he hadn't already done byproposing $20 billion in new revenues in his January budgetproposal, according to New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.   But Sen. Domenici said of Mr. Bush's statement, &quot;If ithelps those who did not want to proceed with negotiations,then it has served its purpose.&quot;   Mr. Bush told reporters, &quot;I'll let the statement speak foritself.&quot; Asked why he had moved now, Mr. Bush said, &quot;It'sessential that these talks get moving and get moving faster.&quot;   One Bush adviser said the president, though aware of thepolitical risks to Republicans, is signaling his willingnessto raise taxes because he believes &quot;what counts most isresults.&quot; He added, &quot;There's nothing as important to apresident as the condition of the economy . . . {and} thehuge major economic issue out there is the budget deficit.&quot;   Lobbyists for one pillar of the Republican constituency,the business community, quickly rallied around Mr. Bush andhis efforts to get deficit-reduction talks going.   ---   Greg Hitt contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
