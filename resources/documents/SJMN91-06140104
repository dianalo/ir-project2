Or, there's always a Fremont angle.;    WhenQueen Elizabeth II visited George Washington's Virginia home Thursday, a fancydress belonging to a Fremont 8-year-old was to be part of the ceremony.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FREMONT FROCK HAD ROYAL DATE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Emily Heddleson could hardly wait to get to Anita Atnip's second-gradeclass at Chadbourne School to share the news that the costume she'd worn in an18th-century-style wedding last summer had been requested for ceremoniesmarking the queen's visit to Mount Vernon.;    You know that little girl whoalways presents flowers to the queen? (Actually, I believe the same littlegirl travels everywhere with the monarch, bobbing curtsies for TV cameras. Thechild is probably chaperoned by the woman who carries spare change for thequeen. The queen's purse contains only sun screen lotion.) Anyhow, the girlneeded an 18th-century dress.;    Back in Fremont, Mom Linda Heddleson hadmade Emily's poufy, rose-strewed dress when the latter participated in Linda'scousin Miles Hamby's wedding in Williamsburg, Va. Emily helped carry thebride's 15-foot train. The entire event -- including the guests' attire -- wasa historically accurate re-creation of an 18th-century wedding.;    In anout-of-this-century labor of love, Linda sewed coordinating costumes for Emilyand her sister Caroline and for herself. &quot;It took from January to June to makeall three,&quot; she says.;    News of quality work gets around in the minuet crowdback East, so historically hip event planners contacted the Heddlesons andpaid Emily $20 for the privilege of borrowing the dress.;    But the wonderfulgown turned out to be the Little Dress That Coulda instead of the Little DressThat Did.;    The flower-presenter came down with chicken pox and couldn't goto the party, reports Linda sadly. And the dress didn't fit the substitute.Aww-w.; (hbox);    MORE STITCHES: If you have a significant birthday oranniversary coming up, Nancy Payton of Fremont has a suggestion. She's windingdown the observance of her 50th birthday, which has been going on for somemonths now. (Hey, she can do what she wants. She says it's her Jubilee Year,quoting Leviticus 25:10. &quot;And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year . . . it shallbe a jubilee unto you.&quot;);    Payton sent out quilt squares to her friends,asking them to stitch up a little something. They sent them back decoratedwith red, white and blue motifs -- from hearts and roses to stars and stripes.The last corner square is a replica of Payton's birth certificate fromAliquippa, Pa. The quilt tops the Payton brass bed, literally a warm reminderof friendship.;    &quot;It's an idea I really encourage people to try,&quot; saysPayton, who reports that others have since been inspired to commemorate majorlife events the old-fashioned way, with friendship quilts.; (hbox);   LITTLE-KNOWN BIO BITS: Ted Harpainter, former head of Fremont parks and awell-known watercolor artist, stopped by town last week. He's heading to Italywith sketchbook soon. But not with a group of artists, as we might expect.&quot;It's a reunion -- nearly the 50th anniversary -- of the ski troops from WorldWar II,&quot; he explains.; (hbox);    THEN AND NOW: Dee Miner, co-coordinator ofSouthern Alameda County National Organization for Women, got carried away atthe state convention and pledged $100 from the chapter to help elect feministcandidates. She admits she chose the &quot;stereotypically female&quot; means to earnthe money: a bake sale at every chapter meeting. Miner bakes, others buy. Shemade $65 with her cupcakes and muffins last week.;    Speaking of money,chapter members mean it when they say they don't want poverty to stand in theway of any person (male or female) who wants to join. &quot;We've brought our duesdown to zero for those who really can't afford them,&quot; says Miner. Used to be$16 to $40.;    (hbox);    BEST BETS: Today, there's multi-culture in Newark.Celtic harpist and story-teller Patrick Ball performs at 2 p.m. at LOV-Newark,37400 Central Court.;    Tri-City Homeless Coalition sponsors anall-you-can-eat buffet from 6:30 p.m. at the Newark Pavilion, Cherry Street atThornton Avenue.
