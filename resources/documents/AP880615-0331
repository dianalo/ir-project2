Worries about crops shortfalls spurred the latest rise in grainprices, while livestock traders feared their market could beflooded if herds had to be reduced extensively because of feedshortages.   On other markets, cotton futures soared; energy futures slumped;precious metals advanced; and stock-index futures rose slightly.   Nearly all contracts for future delivery of grains, soybeans andsoybean products shot up their daily limits early in the session onthe Chicago Board of Trade.   Fears of drought damage to corn and soybean crops deepened as aband of showers moving into Illinois and Indiana weakened andproduced only scattered sprinkles, analysts said.   The drought has begun to take a toll on the corn crop and couldreduce soybean yields if it continues into July, analysts said. Oatand spring wheat crops already have suffered irreversible damage.   ``I'm having a little trouble quantifying the worst drought in60 years _ I'm only 30 years old,'' said Steve Freed, an analystwith Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``We're looking at thepotential worst drought, the worst disaster in history.''   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a new 6-to10-day forecast calling for below-normal rainfall in the Grain Beltin the middle and latter portions of next week.   The Board of Trade announced after the close that it was raisingthe daily price limit on corn futures from 10 cents to 15 cents abushel.   The higher limit will remain in effect for at least threesessions in accordance with exchange rules, which require a 50percent increase in limits following two consecutive days ofmaximum price moves. Corn futures also rose the maximum on Tuesday.   Wheat settled 12 cents to 20 cents higher, with the contract fordelivery in July at $3.94 a bushel; corn was 10 cents higher acrossthe board, with July at $2.79{ a bushel; oats also were 10 centshigher in all contracts, with July at $2.79\ a bushel; and soybeanswere 27 cents to 30 cents higher, with July at $9.20 a bushel.   Many livestock and meat futures plunged their daily limits onthe Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where traders feared the high costof feed grains would prompt widespread liquidation of cattle andhog herds if the dry weather continued.   Livestock producers already have begun reducing their herds bysending more animals to market, which increases the supply of meat,said Chuck Levitt, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. inChicago.   But widespread herd liquidation this year would be followed bytight supplies of meat _ and sharply higher prices _ next yearbecause of a corresponding drop in births, Levitt said.   ``The factors that are driving the grain and soybean complexhigher are the same exact factors forcing the livestock marketslower,'' he said. ``You are creating a catastrophic situation asfar as the herd is concerned by continuing this drought.''   Cattle and hog futures are limited to daily moves of 1{ cents apound, while frozen pork belly futures have a 2-cent limit.   Live cattle settled 1.50 cents lower to .05 cent higher, withthe June delivery contract at 70.30 cents a pound; feeder cattlewere 1.50 cents lower across the board, with August at 71.77 centsa pound; hogs were 1.50 cents lower to .55 cent higher, with Juneat 49.15 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.72 cents to2 cents lower, with July at 44.47 cents a pound.   Dry-weather fears also propelled most cotton futures up thedaily limit of 2 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange.July cotton settled 2 cents higher at 68.91 cents a pound.   Energy futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchangein a reversal of Tuesday's gains.   Analyst Robert Baker of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. saidthe swing reflected uncertainty whether OPEC members would abide bytheir crude-oil production quotas.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 30 cents to 35 centslower, with the July contract at $16.53 a barrel; heating oil was.54 cent to 1.06 cents lower, with July at 43.42 cents a gallon;and unleaded gasoline was .30 cent to .95 cent lower, with July at49.23 cents a gallon.   Gold and silver futures advanced on New York's CommodityExchange in reaction to the soaring grain prices, but gains werelimited by the drop in crude-oil prices, the strength of the dollarand a smaller than expected rise in retail sales last month,analysts said.   Gold settled $1.20 to $1.50 higher, with the August contract at$455.80 a troy ounce; and silver was 8.5 cents to 8.9 cents higher,with July at $7.155 a troy ounce.   Stock-index futures rose slightly on the Chicago MercantileExchange. The contract for June delivery of the Standard andamp; Poor's500 index settled .20 point higher at 274.80.</TEXT></DOC>
