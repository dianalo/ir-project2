The health-care-products concern said one test detects the presence of antibodies to the delta hepatitis virus. Delta hepatitis, a form of hepatitis that is often fatal, strikes chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus.    The other new Abbott test, which recently received Food and Drug Administration approval, is genetically engineered and is used to determine whether a case of hepatitis B is infectious. It is one of a series of tests that physicians use to diagnose the stage and severity of hepatitis B. The company said it expects to begin marketing the test soon. </TEXT></DOC>
