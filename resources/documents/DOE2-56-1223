Broad issues from the report are identified as themost important and are discussed. First is the confusion which surroundsthe policy on the creation, management and disposal of radioactive waste.The Drigg site for low-level waste disposal is criticised in the report.Second is the lack of a proper research programme in the UK for deepgeological disposal. Third is the recognition by the report that if nosatisfactory and publicly acceptable means for the safe disposal of radioactivewaste is found, the continuing production of such waste and, consequently,the nuclear power policy, will be put into question. The debate lastednearly 5 hours and is reported verbatim. Many aspects of the subjectincluding the dry storage of spent fuels, the search for a suitable disposalsite and discharges into the Irish Sea were raised and discussed. (U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
