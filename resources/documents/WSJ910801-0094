Skip the gym. To vanquish fat, simplysmooth on a creamy pink lotion or massage in anherbal-scented gel.   Far-fetched as that may sound, creams that claim tocamouflage fat have become hot sellers during thisbathing-suit season. In their zeal for a quick fix, agingbaby boomers and others are expected to spend $20 millionthis year on products that promise to diminish the appearanceof cellulite -- the term marketers use for the lumpy fatdeposits that ripple across many women's buttocks and thighs.</LP><TEXT>   But now the Food and Drug Administration and the BetterBusiness Bureau are scrutinizing the recent spate ofcellulite treatments, which are marketed by some of theworld's best-known cosmetics companies. Elizabeth Arden, aunit of AngloDutch Unilever Group, claims its gel has thepower to &quot;tone and shape.&quot; Anushka Institute, aManhattan-based salon, is running a half-hour TV commercial,currently being shown on several hundred cable channels, thatfeatures testimonials for its products from newly sveltecustomers. And L'Oreal S.A. pushes a cellulite therapy underits Lancome brand that promises &quot;relief&quot; in just two weeks.   The U.S. medical community believes otherwise. &quot;Celluliteis not a medical term, it's a marketing concept,&quot; says SherylClark, a dermatologist at New York Hospital-Cornell MedicalCenter. Among her unglamorous cures: diet and exercise.   Many anti-cellulite products are imports from France,where consumer protection is less stringent. Even the wordcellulite is French in origin. &quot;Body care products are reallya European phenomenon,&quot; says A.G. Britton, beauty editor atSelf magazine. &quot;But we're all getting a little older here,and with the interest in fitness, body care {products} arebecoming more important.&quot;   In addition to creams and gels, some marketers toutmassaging with special devices to increase circulation -- anapproach also disputed by most doctors. Elancyl, owned byPierre Fabre, sells a nubby plastic soap holder, Clarins S.A.offers a plastic device with a rough surface on one side andplastic fins on the other, and Lancome promotes a bumpyshower tool that, it says, &quot;helps to firm rippled body skin.&quot;   However dubious the products that treat it, the conditionis real enough. As many women age, the pockets of fat thatare stored in the subcutaneous layer of the skin push uparound connective fibers that extend between the muscles andthe outer layer of the skin, resulting in a dimpled look.Women may be more prone to it because their skin is thinnerand they store excess fat on their hips and thighs.   But in their enthusiasm for one of the few bright spots ina lackluster marketplace, cosmetics companies risk runningafoul of government regulators. Spurred by the growingpopularity of such products, the FDA is beginning toinvestigate some cellulite treatment products and claims,according to Daniel Michels, director of the office ofcompliance in the FDA's center for drug evaluation andresearch.   This isn't regulators' first shot. In 1989, the FederalTrade Commission charged Revlon Inc. with makingunsubstantiated claims for its Ultima II ProCollagenAntiCellulite Body Complex. Although the dispute is stillpending, Revlon discontinued the product several years ago.   The National Advertising Division of the Council of BetterBusiness Bureaus Inc. is also looking into marketers' claims.In July, the organization challenged claims made by adirect-marketing company called CosmeSearch Inc. Among theoffending claims were invitations to &quot;smooth away celluliteappearances&quot; and &quot;improve your back view.&quot; CosmeSearch hassince agreed to stop making the claims. Officials at theBetter Business Bureau's advertising division say complaintsagainst other makers will follow soon.   For its part, the FDA is primarily concerned with thequasi-medical nature of some product claims. At issue iswhether marketers are implying that their products willactually purge -- rather than merely conceal -- the unsightlyfat pouches. No product has received FDA approval to makesuch a claim, and any substance that could produce such aphysiological effect would have to be classified as a drug,not a cosmetic, agency officials say.   So far, the FDA hasn't contacted any manufacturers, andagency officials say they can't yet predict whether theirinvestigation will result in regulatory action. The agencyconcedes that it has received no reports that consumers havebeen harmed by the cellulite products, but officials say theFDA's mission is to consistently protect consumers fromunapproved products that act -- or claim to act -- likedrugs. Explains one official: &quot;Even if this is a purelyeconomic issue rather than one of health, somebody has toenforce fair play in the marketplace.&quot;   The precedent for such government action was set in 1987,when the agency filed complaints against 23 cosmeticscompanies, including Estee Lauder Cos. and Avon ProductsInc., for making aggressive anti-aging claims for theirproducts.   At a time when the FDA is growing more vigilant ingeneral, few cosmetics marketers are willing to riskincurring its wrath by complaining publicly about the latestcellulite investigation. In private, however, some questionthe merits of the FDA's probe. They argue that suchregulation is costly and discourages creativity in developingproducts.   In part, the FDA's scrutiny of psuedodrug claims isintensifying because makers of upscale cosmetics are usingmore of them. They have come to count on being able to toutthe supposed technological benefits of their products to helpjustify their premium prices.   The anti-cellulite merchants defend their wares, sayingtheir elixirs improve the skin's appearance. They say theirproducts rely mostly on ingredients that make the skin appeartighter and shouldn't be treated differently frommoisturizing lotions. &quot;What we are doing is not making thefat disappear,&quot; says Christian Oresajo, whose title ismanager of biosciences at Elizabeth Arden. &quot;Cellulite is acosmetic condition.&quot;   But when marketers advertise their products, they seem totalk a different game. Some ads seem to imply the productscan make fat disappear. An ad that ran earlier in the seasonfor Clarins &quot;Cellulite&quot; Control Gel (5.2 ounces for $39.50)exhorted consumers to &quot;slim down, firm up with serious`cellulite' control-Clarins concentrated `Cellulite' ControlGel.&quot;   Carol Schuler, vice president of creative services atClarins, explains that the ad was intended to persuadeconsumers to use Clarins' products at the same time theylaunch a personal fitness campaign. &quot;We're saying, `hey, it'ssummer and it's time to get in shape.' We're not necessarilysaying the product makes you slimmer,&quot; she says.   An ad that ran earlier this summer for Lancome's Cellulite&quot;Relief&quot; Gel ($42.50 for 6.8 ounces) seems to carry the samepromise. The ad, which features a close-up of the thighs of awell-toned model, asserts that clinical tests show itsproduct improves the appearance of the skin after four weeks.The product label goes even further, claiming improvement intwo weeks. Lancome declined to comment.   Claims by Unilever's Elizabeth Arden line appear to run upagainst another pet peeve of the FDA -- citingscientific-sounding clinical tests. An insert in thecompany's Cellulite Very Intensive Beauty Treatment ($32 for6.6 ounces) includes test results &quot;from a renowned universityin France&quot; that purport to measure how much the appearance ofwomen's thighs can improve. After 30 days' use of theproduct, it says, women experienced &quot;up to a 25% reduction inthe appearance of sponginess.&quot;   Elizabeth Arden's Mr. Oresajo explains that the companymeasured the products' efficacy by getting test subjects tostand -- dressed in their bathing suits -- inside a mirroredbox fitted with two cameras. Computers were then used tocompare the surface contours of the skin in photos takenbefore and after. &quot;All we are talking about is smoothing thesurface of the skin,&quot; he says. &quot;We are not making a claim offat reduction.&quot;   Regardless of whether the FDA cracks down on marketers'anti-cellulite claims, some industry watchers predict theproducts' sudden popularity will be fleeting. &quot;Getting peopleto try the product is one thing,&quot; says Allan Mottus, aconsultant to the cosmetics industry. &quot;If the products don'tperform the way consumers expect them too, getting them tomake repeat purchases will be harder.&quot;   &quot;The cream is tingly, and it feels nice when it goes on,&quot;adds a Manhattan attorney, who bought the product only oncebut is too embarrassed to be quoted by name. &quot;I always sortof knew it wouldn't work.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
