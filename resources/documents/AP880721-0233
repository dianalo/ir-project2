Shortly after the 7:12 p.m. EDT liftoff, the satellites were putinto orbit.   The liftoff from the launch pad in Kourou, on the northeastcoast of South America, was the 24th for Arianespace, the companyresponsible for commercial flights of European rockets.   ``We are particularly happy tonight to have successfullylaunched the Indian satellite,'' said Frederic d'Allest, directorof Arianespace.   He noted that ``Arianespace has put 11 satellites into orbit in11 months'' and said the company had additional launches scheduledfor September, October, November and December. Nine launches areset for 1989.   ``But we need to remain vigilant and not be lulled into aroutine,'' he said.   Cloudy weather at the launch site caused a six-minute delay inthe countdown.   At 7:07 p.m. EDT the countdown was resumed and five minuteslater the rocket lifted off into the night sky. Its brilliantorange flame was obscured by the low clouds moments after takeoff.   Seventeen minutes after takeoff the rocket attained the orbitingaltitude of 22,500 miles.   Within four minutes, the two satellites were launched into ageostationary orbit _ ECS-5 for Eutelsat, the European Organizationof Satellite Communications, and INSAT-1C for the Indian government.   Ariane-3 is capable of lifting 2.8 tons into space, compared tothe new generation Ariane-4 rocket which can carry a maximum loadof 4.6 tons. The new, powerful rocket was launched for the firsttime June 15, carrying three satellites into orbit. It is scheduledto blast off again in November.   The versatile Ariane-4, developed at a cost of $575 million,will be used with increasing frequency to meet Arianespace'sbacklog of 42 launch orders.   ECS-5, weighing 2,607 pounds, was constructed jointly by theFrench aerospace and defense giant Matra and British Aerospace. Thesatellite will upgrade long distance telephone service fromPortugal to Finland and Turkey to Ireland during its seven-yearlifespan.   Eutelsat, which groups 26 national telecommunicationsauthorities, had reserved a place on the American Atlas Centaurrocket in case of setbacks in the Arianespace program.   On May 31, 1986, technicians were forced to destroy an Ariane-2rocket shortly after liftoff when a problem in the third-stageignition caused the rocket to go off course. Arianespace suspendedlaunches for 16 months following the failure.   INSAT-1C, constructed by Ford Aerospace, has a lifespan of 10years. It will expand television and long-distance telephoneservice and collect meteorological data. The 2,618-pound satellitewas originally to be carried by an American rocket. But after thefailure of the U.S. space shuttle Challenger, Indian authoritiesdecided to put their valuable cargo aboard an Ariane.   The space shuttle program was grounded after seven astronautswere killed in the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger disaster.   A small leak on the launch pad now threatens to delay thescheduled September launching of the next U.S. space shuttlemission by as much as two months, U.S. officials said. Spaceshuttle Discovery is scheduled to take a crew of five astronautsinto space.   Arianespace now hauls half the world's commercial payloads andholds launch contracts worth $2.5 billion. Eight launches arescheduled for 1988, with nine launches a year planned beginning in1989.</TEXT></DOC>
