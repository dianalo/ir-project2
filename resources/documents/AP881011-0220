(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Crying schoolchildren hugged and hundredsof friends and neighbors gathered Tuesday in a high schoolgymnasium in this rural town to mourn the deaths of five girls whowere struck by a speeding car.   Dozens of floral arrangements surrounded the five caskets in thePulaski High School gymnasium for a community memorial service forthe girls. Nearby, collages depicting each girl's life stood oneasels.   President Reagan sent his condolences to this community of about1,900 about 15 miles northwest of Green Bay. ``Nancy and I joinwith each and every one of you as you mourn the loss of fiveprecious young lives,'' Reagan said in a message delivered by Rep.Toby Roth, R-Wis.   The girls were killed when a car went out of control Friday,sheared off a utility pole and struck them as they stood on thesidewalk. The five victims were: Nicole Watia, 12, and BrendaHylok, Laura Karcz, Jessica McKeefry and Jodi Prokop, all 13. Allwere seventh graders and from Pulaski.   Funerals for the girls were planned for Wednesday.   Organizers of the memorial service collected poems, letters,drawings and a tape recording made by the girls to share with themourners.   Brenda's sister, Connie Krueger, read a poem her sister wroteabout love.   ``You're asking me to stay,'' the poem said. ``Please don't goaway. My heart would never mend, so stay with me until the end.''   Many mourners wiped tears when Nicole's recorded voice sang out,``The flowers you gave me are just about to die. When I think ofwhat could have been, it makes me want to cry.''   James Brawner, principal of Glenbrook Elementary School,estimated more than 2,000 people filed past the caskets before theservice.   Police said no alcohol was involved in the accident.Investigators had not determined by Tuesday why the car wastraveling an estimated 70 mph.   Investigators planned to study the 1975 Cadillac for anypossible mechanical failure this week and hoped to speak with the17-year-old driver next week, said Police Chief Reed Woodward.   ``If we rule out mechanical problems, then, of course, we willbegin looking at (possible) medical problems,'' said the chief. Hehad said earlier police would investigate the possibility thedriver suffered a seizure of some sort before the accident.   The driver, Scott Karcz, a high school junior, was in criticalcondition at a Green Bay hospital Monday. Hospital officials saidTuesday his parents had asked that no further reports be given onhis condition. His 11-year-old sister, a passenger in the car, wasalso seriously injured.   Scott Karcz is a distant relative of Laura Karcz, one of thevictims.</TEXT></DOC>
