Dalton, 813-893-3722.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The snapper-grouper fishery is managedunder the FMP, prepared by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council(Council), and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR Part 646, under theauthority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MagnusonAct). The FMP, implemented September 28, 1983 (48 FR 39463, August 31,1983), addressed growth overfishing of a number of the major species inthe fishery and controversy regarding certain harvest techniques. Minimumsizes were established for five of the major species, and limitations wereimposed on the use of poisons, explosives, fish traps, and trawls in thefishery. A prohibition on use of roller trawls was considered in orderto address concerns about trawl damage to live-bottom habitat and harvestof very small vermilion snapper. The prohibition was rejected because conclusiveevidence of trawl-induced habitat damage was not available at that time.The FMP noted ongoing studies of the effects of trawls on live-bottom habitatand expressed the intent to address this issue via FMP amendment if evidenceof significant damage was documented. Information is now available to documenthabitat damage resulting from use of bottom trawls in live-bottom areas.Amendment 1 addresses the problems of habitat damage and trawl harvestof undersized fish by prohibiting the use of trawl gear in a directed snapper-grouperfishery between Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and Cape Canaveral, Florida.A vessel possessing trawl gear and more than 200 pounds of fish in thesnapper-grouper fishery (as listed in andSection;646.2) is defined as a participantin a directed fishery. It is a rebuttable presumption that a vessel possessingfish in the snapper-grouper fishery harvested those fish in the EEZ.In addition, Amendment 1 updates the habitat section of the FMP and incorporatesvessel safety considerations into the FMP.The primary habitat for the major species in the snapper-grouper fishery,the historical use of trawl gear to harvest snapper-grouper species, evidenceof live-bottom habitat damage by trawl gear, the effect of trawl gear onthe harvest of undersized vermilion snapper, and analysis of the economicimpacts of implementing Amendment 1 were fully discussed in the proposedrule (53 FR 42985, October 25, 1988) and are not repeated here. In addition,changes to the regulations proposed by NOAA to redefine the area southof Fowey Rocks Light, Florida wherein fish traps may not be placed, andother technical changes were discussed in the proposed rule and are notrepeated here.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Responses</ITAG>NOAA received twenty-seven letters from recreational fishermen, sportfishingorganizations, a conservation organization, two federal agencies, a statenatural resource agency, and a member of Congress supporting Amendment1 and implementation of the proposed rule. Most of these commenters andthe Council requested a waiver of the 30-day delayed effectiveness of thisfinal rule under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). This waiver wouldmake the rule effective near the beginning of the trawl season and, thus,would avoid additional habitat damage. Six letters opposing Amendment 1and the proposed rule were received from individuals associated with aSea Grant Marine Extension Service. The U.S. Coast Guard indicated supportfor the proposed rule but expressed concerns about enforceability.<ITAG tagnum="84">U.S. Coast Guard Concerns </ITAG>The Coast Guard indicated that the rule may not be effective in preventinghabitat damage, because vessels can trawl over live bottom for other speciesand discard snapper-grouper to avoid exceeding the 200-pound limit. Althoughthis is theoretically possible, NOAA does not believe this will occur.To our knowledge, there are no other trawl fisheries that target theselive-bottom areas. Shrimp and calico scallop trawling do not occur in theseareas. It is unlikely that finfish, other than the 69 species defined tobe in the snapper-grouper fishery, would be sufficiently abundant in theseareas to support directed fisheries and justify the extensive culling ofsnapper-grouper species that would be required. The Coast Guard also suggestedthat, because the rule does not prohibit the transfer of trawl gear, atrawl vessel could avoid detection of having engaged in a directed snapper-grouperfishery by transferring his gear at sea after use. NOAA considers the transferat sea of trawl gear to be a cumbersome, time-consuming operation thatwill not be undertaken readily. If either of these problems does occur,amendment of the regulations will be considered. Finally, the Coast Guardcommented that, because at-sea enforcement would still be required, thisrule would not significantly reduce enforcement costs. NOAA concurs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Marine Extension Service Comments </ITAG>These commenters expressed a number of concerns about Amendment 1 including:(1) Data regarding habitat damage due to trawling are limited; (2) oneof the cited studies indicated that the density of sponges and other invertebratesincreased twelve months after the area was trawled; (3) other alternativessuch as minimum size limits or prohibiting trawling only in specified areasshould have been adopted; (4) the 200-pound limit will create a hardshipfor multi-gear vessels; and (5) prohibiting all trawling by vessels withmore than 200 pounds of fish in the snapper-grouper fishery will precludedevelopment of other trawl harvesting methods. Responses are categorizedbelow. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scientific Data </ITAG>NOAA acknowledges that the scientific information regarding habitat damagedue to trawling are somewhat limited but concludes that information presentedadequately demonstrates that trawling in the live-bottom areas that supportmost of the snapper-grouper fishery will result in habitat damage. Althoughone study did authors specifically stated that commercial trawlers oftendrag repeatedly over the same area and that multiple tows would probablyhave caused much greater damage to sponge and coral populations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Alternatives </ITAG>Minimum size limits to control the trawl harvest of small vermilion snapperwere previously considered by the Council and rejected because of the poorsurvival rate of undersized fish that would be released. Further, minimumsizes would not address the problem of habitat damage. The alternativeof prohibiting trawling only in specified live-bottom areas would requireknowledge of the precise locations of all of these areas. Such informationis not currently available. Because these areas are believed to be sparselydistributed, enforcement of a patchwork of prohibited areas would be extremelydifficult, and compliance by fishermen might be difficult as well. Further,the snapper-grouper trawl fishery is prosecuted predominantly, if not exclusively,over areas containing live bottom because that is the primary habitat ofthe target species. It would appear that there would be little to be gainedby allowing directed snapper-grouper trawling in areas devoid of live bottom.NOAA believes this alternative is impractical. <ITAG tagnum="84">200-Pound Limit </ITAG>The final rule prohibits the use of trawl gear in a directed snapper-grouperfishery in the prescribed area. The 200-pound limit is the criterion usedto define a directed fishery. The Council specifically considered the potentialhardship that the 200-pound criterion might create for vessels (primarilyshrimpers) that possess trawls and occasionally use other gear to catchsnapper-grouper on the same trip. Representatives of the State fisheriesagencies from North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia indicated thatshrimp vessels would not be impacted. Data provided by Florida representativesindicated that of 8,396 shrimp trips taken during 1985-1987 only threeexceeded the 200-pound limit. The number of multi-gear vessels likely tobe affected by this criterion appears to be small. Because the criterionis critical to enforcement of the trawl prohibition, NOAA concludes thatthe measure is justified. <ITAG tagnum="84">Impact on Development of New Trawling Methods </ITAG>The prohibition on use of trawl gear in a directed snapper-grouper fisheryis intended to prevent habitat damage and reduce growth by overfishingof vermilion snapper. There is no intent to ``. . . stymie technologicaladvances and economic growth of fisheries. . . .'' The regulations forthe Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic (50 CFR Part 646) containa provision that allows the Secretary of Commerce to authorize, for theacquisition of information and data, activities otherwise prohibited bythe regulations. Under this provision, a request for an exemption to allowlimited research to evaluate alternative trawl technologies could be considered.This would provide a reasonable opportunity for technological advances.Data obtained from such research could be submitted to the Council forconsideration of possible modification of the regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Waiver of Delayed Effectiveness </ITAG>NOAA has determined that delay of the effectiveness of this final rulefor 30 days would lead to further habitat damage, and further harvest bythe trawl fishery of undersized vermilion snapper, and thus would be contraryto the public interest. Therefore, ``good cause'' exists under section553(d)(3) of the APA to waive the delayed effectiveness of this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>The Secretary of Commerce determined that Amendment 1 is necessary forthe conservation and management of the snapper-grouper fishery and thatit is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, NOAA, determined that thisrule is not a ``major rule'' requiring a regulatory impact analysis underE.O. 12291. This rule is not likely to result in an annual effect on theeconomy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices forconsumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies,or geographic regions; or a significant adverse effect on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. The Council prepared a regulatory impact review for this rule. A summaryof the economic effects was included in the proposed rule and is not repeatedhere. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the SmallBusiness Administration that this rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. As a result, a regulatoryflexibility analysis was not prepared. The reasons for this determinationwere included in the proposed rule and are not repeated here. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, (Assistant Administrator),determined that this rule will be implemented in a manner that is consistentto the maximum extent practicable with the approved coastal zone managementprograms of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida. Georgia does nothave an approved coastal zone management program. This determination wassubmitted for review by the responsible State agencies under Section 307of the Coastal Zone Management Act. The State agencies agreed with thisdetermination. The Council prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for Amendment 1 and,based on the EA, the Assistant Administrator concluded that there willbe no significant adverse impact on the human environment as a result ofthis rule. This rule does not contain a collection-of-information requirement forpurposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O. 12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 646 </ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 11, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
