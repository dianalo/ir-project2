Yoshihiko Kawamura was replaced, effective immediately, by58-year-old Shoichi Yoshimura, an Itoman vice president.</LP><TEXT>   The move was taken at a Friday board meeting with a voteon an emergency resolution calling for Mr. Kawamura'sreplacement, an Itoman spokesman said. Some Japanese newsreports described the firing as &quot;a corporate coup d'etat.&quot;   The spokesman suggested that Itoman had no alternative butsuch radical action &quot;because relations with those we havebusiness with were getting worse day by day.&quot; He added that&quot;there was growing concern {about the company's future} bothinside and outside the company.&quot;   Itoman's creditors had reportedly called on Mr. Kawamura,66, to step down and take responsibility for the company'sproblems, but the executive had refused.   The new president, according to the spokesman, declared ata news conference in Osaka after the board meeting that therewould be no immediate change in the current restructuringprogram. The plan calls for the company to reduce itsproperty-investment-related debts by about 700 billion yen($5.3 billion) by the end of September 1991. Itoman's totalestimated debt load at the end of September was 1.3 trillionyen.   The spokesman emphasized that Mr. Yoshimura made it clearthat he will support the company's rehabilitation efforts byworking closely with a five-member team sent in by SumitomoBank Ltd., Itoman's main lender, in November to rehabilitatethe ailing company.   The spokesman denied that Sumitomo played any direct rolein the firing of Mr. Kawamura. But the bank apparently hasbeen stepping up its commitment to Itoman. According toJapanese news reports, Sumitomo has lent an additional 175billion yen to Itoman and its two subsidiaries in the pasttwo months alone. The loans were to help make up forunrenewed loans by other financial institutions and also wereto help Itoman honor its commercial paper, the reports said.   Sumitomo's loans to Itoman and its two subsidiaries, nowestimated at 475 billion yen, represent more than one-thirdof Itoman's total estimated debt.   Mr. Kawamura was once a managing director of Sumitomo. Butthe bank in 1975 sent him to Itoman to turn around thetrading concern, which was then loaded with debts stemmingfrom a recession in the textile industry.   Unlike Mr. Kawamura, the new president is an Itoman careeremployee and has been in charge of the company's food-relateddivision for many years.</TEXT></DOC>
