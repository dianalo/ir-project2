On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission voted to seek a court order blocking the purchase as anticompetitive.    John C. Holt, a Dun andamp; Bradstreet executive vice president, said that &quot;obviously I disagree&quot; with the agency. He added, however, that to try to pursue the merger now &quot;would mean tying up our people and our customers for two to three years.&quot;    Analysts aren't sure whether Dun's withdrawal makes Information Resources a takeover candidate. Some see it as a good fit with several concerns, and the company confirmed yesterday that it had received an informal overture from Saatchi andamp; Saatchi PLC, a big London-based advertising firm, last summer. A formal bid, however, didn't materialize.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Information Resources stock plunged $8 to close at $13, indicating that many traders don't see much takeover interest in the Chicago-based company. &quot;The arbs who were in this on a special basis don't want to own it for the long term,&quot; said Paul Combs, an industry analyst at William Blair andamp; Co., Chicago.    Information Resources executives said they aren't aware of any suitors and plan to remain independent.    New York-based Dun andamp; Bradstreet is a financial information company that specializes in tracking product movement in packaged goods. It owns Nielsen Media Research, the television-audience measurement concern, and Nielsen Marketing Research, which tracks information on brand sales and market share.    Information Resources' biggest single product measures the effect of television advertising on sales of packaged goods. The FTC said it had reason to believe that the merger could substantially reduce competition in syndicated national tracking of consumer buying.    Under an agreement reached in August, Dun andamp; Bradstreet was to have paid 0.5084 share of Dun common for each of Information Resources' 16.8 million common shares.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Dun andamp; Bradstreet closed at $52.625 a share, down 62.5 cents.    The breakup of the proposed combination will probably intensify the rivalry between Information Resources and Dun andamp; Bradstreet's Nielsen Marketing Research unit.    John Malec, the 43-year-old co-founder of Information Resources, said he expects the former suitor to try to mimic the one-year-old InfoScan service that competes directly with Nielsen's supermarket survey. In addition to collecting market share data on supermarket goods, InfoScan tracks purchases by a panel of 65,000 households.    Both companies are developing expensive plans to establish a national tracking service based on supermarket scanning data, said Peter Falco, a Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. analyst. &quot;It seemed to me you could have avoided tremendous duplication of Randamp;D effort&quot; had the merger gone through, he said.    Dun andamp; Bradstreet's Mr. Holt said the company had been interested in marketing Information Resources' products, along with its own, in foreign countries where Dun andamp; Bradstreet is already active. Dun andamp; Bradstreet will &quot;continue to invest in this area. Whether it's development or acquisition will depend on the need,&quot; he said.    Mr. Falco said he doubted that any other company would be as attractive to Dun as Information Resources, whose strength is monitoring new products being tested in individual markets.    Industry analysts said Information Resources has to win back business from clients who apparently had held off using InfoScan on the assumption that it would become a Dun andamp; Bradstreet service if the proposed acquisition was completed.    Information Resources said this hiatus helped cause a third-quarter loss of $2.4 million. The company said it isn't clear whether it will generate a fourth-quarter profit, but said it expects to return to profitability at least by early next year.    Separately, in a move designed to beef up its top management, Information Resources yesterday said Mr. Malec returned as chairman of a re-established three-person executive committee. Mr. Malec resigned in January 1986 as chief executive officer for personal reasons, although he continued as chairman of the company. </TEXT></DOC>
