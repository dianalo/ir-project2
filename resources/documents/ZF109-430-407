It was just for ego gratification -- an ego trip.&quot; Neidorfattorney Sheldon Zenner, who was described by a courtroom observer asimpressive with a &quot;brilliant&quot; opening argument, was quoted as saying, &quot;We arejust grateful that the U.S.andP;  Attorney*s office took the evidence intoconsideration.&quot;andM;The Neidorf case had attracted the attention of a large segment of thecomputer community when constitutional issues concerning both the free speechrights of an electronic publisher and the legitimacy of government seizure ofequipment were raised.andP;  It become one of the focuses of the ElectronicFrontier Foundation (EFF) launched on July 10th by Mitchell Kapor and JohnPerry Barlow.andP;  The EFF funded the participation of the New York law firm ofRabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky andamp; Lieberman in the Neidorf case in anadvisory position.andM;EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow told Newsbytes, &quot;We are extremely pleasedwith the result and we are proud of our government for the willingness totake what must have been a loss of face when confronted with the true natureof the case.andP;  We recognize that these are complex issues and it takes timefor the non-technical to become familiar with everything involved.&quot;andM;Jim Warren, long time computer insider and founder of the West Coast ComputerFaire and InfoWorld Magazine, told Newsbytes that he had a much more mixedreaction to the outcome, &quot;I am delighted that Neidorf was exonerated;saddened that the government avoided a serious loss that might have setuseful precedents regarding electronic press freedoms and civil liberties;infuriated that adequate defense of constitutional issues is only availablevia the wealthy; and satisfied that the other three will get what theydeserve for having plea-bargained a guilty plea, agreeing to serve theprosecution.&quot;andM;(Barbara E.
