Early today, riot policeand tanks patrolled the streets.   The government blamed the disturbances, in which thousands tookpart, on leftist agitators and drug traffickers and vowed to ``takeall necessary actions to maintain order and tranquillity.''   Authorities reported ``numerous'' arrests, but gave no figure.   The emergency declared Friday by President Jose Azcona Hoyobroadens police powers to make arrests and searches, bans publicdemonstrations and restricts travel in the capital and San PedroSula, 120 miles to the south.   The government, the leading U.S. ally in Central America,forcibly pooled Honduras' 140 radio stations into a nationalnetwork that broadcast appeals for people to remain calm.Storeowners boarded their windows.   Late Friday, authorities said police and soldiers had seizedMolotov cocktails in a raid on the National Teachers' School.   The government press office said groups, some armed withincendiary devices and others with automatic pistols, had beenarrested throughout the capital.   During the night, four bombs exploded in separate parts of thecapital, but no injuries were reported, government-controlled radiosaid.   It said demonstrators torched six automobiles in San Pedro Sulaon Friday, but gave no further details on disturbances in that city.   One government official, speaking on condition of anonymity,said ``numerous persons have been detained'' in both cities. He didnot elaborate.   In a statement, the government claimed the protests had beeninstigated by narcotics traffickers it did not name and ``adangerous infiltration of Marxist indoctrination, hate, terror anddestruction'' in Honduran schools.   Friday's violence began when students filled the streets toprotest, as they had the previous day, the forced deportation of aHonduran suspected of cocaine trafficking and involvement in theslaying of a U.S. drug agent.   About 100 Tegucigalpa schools and both universities in thecapital closed early on Friday, their students out on the streets.   On Thursday night, about 2,000 university students set fire tothe U.S. Embassy annex and 25 cars owned by embassy personnel. Fivedemonstrators were killed and 10 wounded.   Police said about 20 private Honduran guards on duty at theembassy compound had opened fire with sawed-off shotguns. Riotpolice who dispersed the demonstrators not arrive until about twohours later.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakleyexpressed puzzlement Friday at the amount of time it took police toarrive on the scene. She also said that neither the privateHonduran guards employed by the embassy nor U.S. Marine guards hadfired on the demonstrators.   The students were protesting the arrest and delivery to theUnited States this week of Juan Ramon Matta, who was wanted forquestioning in the 1985 killing in Mexico of a U.S. DrugEnforcement Agency, Enrique Camarena Salazar.   The alleged cocaine trafficker was seized at his luxury home.   Protesters also expressed anger at President Reagan's dispatchof 3,200 American troops to Honduras last month.   On Tuesday, soldiers and police placed Matta onto a plane to theDominican Republic without a passport. Dominican officials put himon a New York-bound flight and he was arrested en route by U.S.marshals.   Matta is being held at the maximum-security federal prison inMarion, Ill.   Honduran legislators called the incident a kidnapping and theForeign Ministry launched an investigation. Honduras has noextradition treaty with the United States and the constitutionforbids the extradition of Hondurans.   President Reagan dispatched the U.S. troops March 17 at Azcona'srequest after a reported incursion into Honduras by Nicaraguantroops pursuing Contra rebels, who have operated out of thiscountry.   In Managua, the Sandinista government condemned Friday'scrackdown in Honduras as a violation of the Central American peaceplan signed by the region's five presidents on Aug. 7.</TEXT></DOC>
