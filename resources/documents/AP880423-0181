China's Foreign Ministry informed U.S. Ambassador Winston Lordof its new stand after American and Iranian naval forces clashed inthe Persian Gulf this week, The New York Times reported in itsSaturday editions.   In Moscow, meanwhile, the Soviets turned down a renewed requestfrom Secretary of State George P. Shultz for support of an armsembargo.
