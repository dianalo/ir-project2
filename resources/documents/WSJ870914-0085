Unfortunately, science's ability to spot these diseases is outstripping by many years its ability to do very much to prevent or treat them. This lag is creating complex medical, legal and moral dilemmas involving family relationships, confidentiality of medical data, proper counseling and much more.    The rapidly multiplying number of people caught in this time gap between diagnosis and possible therapy requires an &quot;interim ethic,&quot; says LeRoy Walters, a bioethicist at the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University. He would like a set of principles that &quot;allows large social institutions to avoid unreasonable harm, while at the same time protecting the liberty and welfare rights of individuals and families.&quot;    Congress's Office of Technology Assessment has been studying the subject for many months, and it plans to issue a report late this year.    Recombinant DNA technology is largely responsible for identifying a score of disorders with a genetic cause or important genetic component, including diseases as disparate as Huntington's and manic depression. For many of these, predictive tests are in use; for others, the search for a valid test is continuing.    For a few diseases, such as sickle-cell anemia, scientists have located and isolated the defective gene that causes the disorder. Once the gene has been identified, researchers can begin figuring out its function and then start searching for possible therapy.    With many diseases, though, scientists have only identified a so-called genetic marker -- an easily located bit of DNA that is so consistently inherited with the defective gene as to leave no doubt that the person has the gene itself. Huntington's and cystic fibrosis are identifed by markers.    In still other instances, research is pointing toward a &quot;genetic predisposition&quot; to such common disorders as hardening of the arteries and some cancers. These findings tend to be the least definitive so far, since they seem to involve a combination of several genetic factors and environmental &quot;triggers.&quot;    Occasionally, particularly in the case of genetic predispositions, diagnosis and testing can dictate changes in life style, diet or drugs that reduce the risk of disease. But for many serious inherited diseases, little or no treatment exists.    Until recently, genetic testing has had its widest impact on the birth process. Testing of worried would-be parents before conception or testing of a fetus during pregnancy can provide welcome reassurance for some at-risk couples, but a dreadful choice -- to abort or not -- for others. Now, though, more and more testing -- and the quandaries that go with it -- involves the health of individuals already born. Some of the questions:    Who Wants to Know if Early Death Is Likely?    Symptoms of Huntington's disease usually don't appear until a person's late 30s or early 40s, but then lead to progressive nerve deterioration and early death. Recently developed pre-symptomatic tests, using a genetic marker, can predict with 96% accuracy whether a person eventually will develop the disease.    Surveys of people with a family history of Huntington's find high percentages saying they would like to know their chances. The test can remove stressful uncertainty, either freeing potential victims of worry or, if positive, allowing them to decide more intelligently whether to marry, have children, change jobs -- in general, better plan their remaining healthy years.    &quot;Huntington's is a diagnosis I hate to make,&quot; says Gilbert Omenn, dean of the University of Washington School of Public Health. &quot;But so many families thank me. They say, 'You have to understand what we have been through with the uncertainty. Now at least we can plan to deal with what we know is really there.'&quot;    But testing programs under way at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and Massachusetts General Hospital suggest that the percentage actually willing to be tested may be far smaller than the surveys indicate. Of 349 at-risk adults told by Johns Hopkins that the test was available, only 65 have asked for it. Because nothing can be done to prevent or delay the disease, many people apparently prefer to live with uncertainty than to learn they are doomed.    Some medical specialists worry that certain people who find out they're sure to develop a late-onset disease won't be able to handle the news. A number of people diagnosed with Huntington's try to commit suicide, and some succeed. &quot;Uncovering genes that regulate human vulnerability to grave illnesses such as Huntington's chorea or Alzheimer's disease could increase the incidence of suicide as well as selective abortion,&quot; says University of Illinois bioethicist Marc Lappe.    Can a Relative Be Forced to Help?    Genetic probes based on markers rather than defective genes require a &quot;linkage&quot; analysis involving blood or tissue samples from parents, grandparents and other close relatives, including at least one with the disease. An individual seeking the test must persuade these other family members to cooperate.    But what if a family member refuses? Will the person wanting the test go to court to try to compel the reluctant relative, or simply hate him or her for life? In the Johns Hopkins program, one man wanted the test, but his twin didn't. For a long while, the father of a young man wouldn't cooperate, arguing that his son wasn't up to coping with a positive test report.    &quot;Suppose the person has cystic fibrosis, and you want to find out whether the siblings are at risk,&quot; says John Graham, a geneticist at Dartmouth Medical School. &quot;You stir up a lot of guilt within the family as soon as you ask parents or grandparents for a blood sample. There's a lot of reluctance to cooperate.&quot;    Occasionally a sense of guilt or shame or some other factor makes a person testing positive reluctant to tell other relatives who might themselves be at risk and need to be tested. Philip Reilly, medical director of the Shriver Center for Mental Retardation, says the person being tested may have not only a moral but &quot;a legal obligation to warn the appropriate relatives.&quot; He suggests a court might &quot;permit a woman to sue her sister for failing to warn her about a pertinent reproductive risk, the knowledge of which would have given her an opportunity to avoid the birth of a severely impaired child.&quot;    What is a doctor's responsibility to these relatives if the patient refuses to tell them? &quot;I leave it in the hands of the person who is consulting me,&quot; says Dr. Graham. &quot;I think I am good enough to get the point across that the results are going to come out sooner or later, and that if the information isn't shared now, the eventual rift will be all the greater.&quot;    And if the doctor can't persuade the patient? In 1983, a presidential commission suggested that while confidentiality should be a general rule, doctors and other healthcare providers should alert relatives at serious risk, and a number of medical officials agree. But Lori Andrews, an American Bar Foundation specialist, declares: &quot;Many physicians want to inform relatives, but I caution them they're taking a big chance&quot; of being sued for invading a patient's privacy.    How Much Should Pationts Be Told?   As with most medical procedures, a person considering genetic testing must give &quot;informed consent&quot; -- not just agreeing to take the test but understanding just what the test shows and how reliably, the stresses of coping with a positive result, possible treatments, and the stresses that might result from not taking the test.    Explaining all this is demanding. The Johns Hopkins Huntington's program, for example, gives people extensive counseling before even asking for a decision on whether they want to take the test.    &quot;Informed consent is an enormous problem,&quot; says Joan Marks, who oversees a Sarah Lawrence College program training graduate students to be genetic counselors. &quot;If a patient doesn't understand what he is being told, how can he give informed consent? And many physicians are just not that great at communicating.&quot;    What About Doctors Who Are Ill-Informed?   With proper counseling so critical and genetic diagnosis developing so fast, many specialists worry that the average doctor won't stay up-to-date and will fail to inform and guide patients adequately. Some may refer patients to genetic counselors, but as testing expands in coming years, the number of qualified counselors will almost certainly fall far short of needs. Last year, Ms. Marks says, she had 25 graduates for 70 jobs available.    So far, most genetic testing is conducted by university and other specialized labs. But several biotechnology firms are hard at work on diagnostic kits for use in doctors' offices and nonspecialized labs. Thus, far more future testing will be done by doctors and lab technicians who may not have much experience in this field, and many geneticists worry that reliability will inevitably suffer.    But others say these fears are exaggerated. &quot;To practice modern medicine you have to keep up with many things -- new drugs, new equipment, new operations,&quot; Dr. Omenn says. &quot;Genetic information isn't all that difficult to keep up with.&quot;    Some see a strong role for government in this area, to make sure that biotechnology firms don't oversell their tests' abilities and to ensure a high standard of laboratory work.    Can Third Parties Insist on Tests?    As more and better genetic probes emerge, insurance companies and employers surely will push to use them. Employers won't want to hire or promote high-risk people likely to have late-onset disorders that will cut productivity and push up the company's health-insurance and workmen's compensation costs. Insurers will seek to limit their risks by insisting on genetic testing as a condition of life-insurance coverage and possibly health-insurance coverage also, and then charging higher premiums or denying coverage to those likely to develop costly or fatal illnesses. A debate is inevitable over whether such third parties should have the right to use genetic-test results and the extent to which doctors can breach a patient's privacy by giving results to insurers or employers without the patient's consent.    Many argue that physicians must keep such information confidential. &quot;The right to privacy includes the expectation that genetic information will not be obtained or disseminated without the patient's consent,&quot; says Dr. Reilly of the Shriver Center. To protect patients, he urges legislation that would limit the right of third parties to request genetic tests or to get access to the results of such tests.    But others believe that employers and insurers are entitled to genetic-test data and that in some cases the interests of society should override individual rights to confidentiality. For example, shouldn't airlines be free to require testing to screen out pilots with inherited predisposition to early heart attack? &quot;If you're a frequent flyer, you might see your safety as more important than the pilot's right to privacy,&quot; says Jason Brandt, a neuropsychologist in charge of the Huntington's program at Johns Hopkins.    Will Everyone Eventually Be Tested?   For the immediate future, testing will usually be done for specific individuals with family history of a disease or other reason to suspect a genetic disorder. Most current testing uses genetic markers, and since these tests involve family members, they are too unwieldy for screening of the general population. Moreover, present tests are still too expensive and unreliable for general screening programs.    But as testing reliability improves and more effective treatments emerge, there are bound to be proposals to test entire segments of the population -- all teen-agers, for example.    Already, there are pointers in this direction. All states require routine testing of newborns for phenylketonuria, because early detection and treatment of the enzyme deficiency can reduce some brain damage. A National Institutes of Health panel recently recommended that all newborns be screened for sickle-cell anemia; early detection and treatment can limit fatal infections.    &quot;There is more and more activity in state legislatures to require prenatal or newborn screening for more and more disorders, on a cost-benefit argument&quot; that early detection and treatment can limit future costs, says Ms. Andrews.    But many people question whether saving money is valid reason to invade a person's privacy, and contend that benefit-cost ratios must be very large to justify mandatory screening without consent. Others argue that general-population testing is likely to produce too many false results.    Obviously, many of the issues to be resolved in connection with genetic testing -- widespread screening, confidentiality, adequate counseling and others -- are similar to those now being debated on testing for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Some think policies now being developed on AIDS will set a pattern for genetic testing, despite substantial differences between the two areas.    &quot;AIDS is blazing this giant pathway about how much society really needs to know about all these risks,&quot; says Dartmouth's Dr. Graham.    But Thomas Murray, director of the Center for Medical Ethics at Case Western Reserve University, is more cautious. &quot;All the right issues are being raised in the AIDS debate, and the right arguments are being made,&quot; he says. &quot;But I think the results are going to be a pretty mixed bag. I wouldn't want them carried over&quot; to genetic testing.    ---         Decade of Discovery   During the past 10 years, a genetic cause or importantgenetic ingredient has been discovered in a score ofdisorders.
