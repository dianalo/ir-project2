 Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) let flat-file databaseusers incorporate graphics into their database and sometimes moveback and forth between the database and other applications runningunder the same GUI.andP;  GUIs also make databases easier to usebecause they provide a common interface across applications.andO;Other DBMS characteristics potential buyers should considerinclude report-generating flexibility, support for calculatedfields, and the ability to import and export data in formats otherapplications can read.andP;  Flat-file databases have become verysophisticated, but they are not suitable for sophisticateddata-manipulation tasks because they lack the relational model.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Data base management systemsSoftware SelectionGraphical User InterfaceDirectoriesData Management.andO;Feature:   illustrationtable.andO;Caption:   What to ask when buying (table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Dale LewallenandM;Perhaps the greatest benefit users can derive from a PC is the ability toaccurately store large amounts of data.andP;  Buyers can choose from a wide rangeof database-management system products designed to help them store andmanipulate thousands or even millions of pieces of information quickly andefficiently.andM;At the higher end of the database-management system (DBMS) price range, userscan purchase relational-database products that are useful for storing largequantities of information.andP;  Although the relational model can be used forsimpler tasks such as maintaining a small mailing list or for personaldatabase needs, these tasks are often better handled by flat-file DBMSprograms.andM;Generally, flat-file DBMS products have fewer features than more powerfulrelational databases and consequently require less memory than their morecomplex brethren.andP;  There is a great deal of overlap between the two productcategories, however.andP;  There are flat-file database programs, for example,that rival the storage capacity of many relational products, while there areless expensive relational databases that have fewer bells and whistles thansome flat-file products.andM;For the most part, flat-file DBMS products are regarded as not havingfeatures that let users link two or more files.andM;A flat-file database running under a graphical user interface (GUI) canprovide the user with several benefits, including the ability to incorporategraphical images and, with some products, an easy transition from otherapplication products based on the same GUI.andP;  The availability of pictures orimages can add meaning and clarity to a database record that a text-onlysystem cannot provide.andM;A corporate personnel database can be greatly enhanced with the addition ofgraphical images.andP;  A database that includes photos of listed employees wouldbe beneficial to security officers, for example, who would have access onlyto portions of the record they needed, such as the employee's name, worklocation and picture; personal information such as salary and home addresswould not be accessible to the security officer.andM;Another significant benefit of flat-file database products with GUIs isconsistency with other application programs that sport graphical interfaces.andM;If a database program is written to conform to Microsoft Corp.'s Windows GUI,for example, users accustomed to programs written for Windows such asMicrosoft's Excel or Micrografx Inc.'s Designer could easily operate thedatabase program.andM;Daniel Browning, president of Precision Inc. in Irving, Texas, said running adatabase system in the Windows environment offers other benefits as well.andM;&quot;Windows products provide a lot more than just a graphical user interface,&quot;said Browning.andP;  &quot;With the ability to do interprogram communication, they havea synergistic relationship with other [Windows] products,&quot; he explained.andO;&quot;You can clip data from your Windows DBMS product and paste it into yourWindows word processor or spreadsheet.&quot;andM;Precision sells SuperBase 2, a graphical-interface flat-file DBMS, andSuperBase 4, a relational-database product.andM;Chris Lee, head of development and support for Blyth Software Ltd., inSaxmundham, England, believes that many skills are transferable betweenapplications written for a GUI.andM;&quot;The overall consistency across all applications is important,&quot; said Lee.andO;&quot;[This consistency] will make people [who use GUIs] more productive sincethey tend to use a broader range of applications than people who usecharacter-based interfaces.&quot;andM;For example, users who know how to move and resize windows in one program caneasily transfer those skills to a database product when the two programs rununder the same GUI environment.andM;&quot;Users don't have to know how to transfer data,&quot; said Browning.andM;Also, if a mouse is supported and proves to be useful with the databaseproduct, users can directly transfer mouse skills they have learned fromother products that work with the same GUI.andM;Potential buyers of flat-file DBMSs should also consider other featuresgermane to both flat-file and relational products.andM;Since the object of storing data in a database is to display it eventually insome form or another, buyers should consider the flexibility of a product'sreporting options.andP;  Many database products include simple report-writermodules that ease the process of creating reports, and some offer predefinedreports for mailing labels.andM;Buyers should also consider whether or not a product can create calculated or&quot;virtual&quot; fields that contain information calculated from figures stored intwo or more fields in the database.andP;  This would make it unnecessary to storethe value of parts in a warehouse within a database, for example, because thetotal can be calculated by multiplying the quantity on hand with the value ofeach piece, prior to printing out the result on a report.andM;In addition, database programs are often required to share data with otherprograms.andM;One of the most common uses of a database is to provide name and address datathat can be merged with a word-processing document.andM;Since the document often requires the data to be in a certain format, buyersshould consider the ability of the database program to output information indifferent formats such as comma-separated variable or space-delimitedformats.andM;Some database products can import and export data in the Ashton-Tate dBASEIII file format, and a few can directly read and write dBASE III-compatiblefiles.andP;  If this is the case, users do not have to learn dBASE III, but canuse tools already familiar to them to extract or modify data in a dBASE IIIfile.andM;Buyers should keep in mind that although many flat-file products incorporatefeatures that were once found only in more expensive relational products,they lack the true relational model that has proven to be so useful forcertain data-manipulation tasks.andM;The relational model is most often used when repeating data throughout atable would be inefficient.andP;  This is true for inventory databases andpersonnel database applications, for example.andM;In contrast, flat-file database products are best suited to applications suchas mailing-list management, individual database needs and other applicationswhere redundancy is not a major problem.andM;Flat-file DBMS products generally let users store data in only one database,or table.andP;  The disadvantage of this lies in the way data is stored.andM;Consider the case of a database that stores information about a company'semployees.andP;  Each employee is given a department number, which signifies aparticular department name.andM;With most flat-file databases, it would be necessary to store with eachrecord not only the department number but also the department name, resultingin a great deal of duplication and wasted space.andM;For example, if there were 100 employees in the research department, thedatabase would have to store 100 multiplied by eight characters (the numberof letters in the word &quot;research&quot;).andP;  That's 800 unnecessary characters.andM;Buyers should consider the features available in each product to help themsearch for information contained in the database.andP;  They should check to seeif the product can index fields in the database or sort data so searchesoccur more rapidly.andM;Finally, they should pay attention to the flexibility allowed in Booleansearches, such as the ability to search for &quot;Stocks AND Bonds NOT T-Bills.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
