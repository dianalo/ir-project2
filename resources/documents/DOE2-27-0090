These boundaries were found to microscopicallyfollow {110} planes, even when they appeared macroscopically along otherplanes, such as {111}. High resolution micrographs from edge-on {110}inversion boundaries were taken in [110] and [100] projection. In certainareas, shifts of the images of {111} and {200} planes across the boundarieswere observed. Image simulations confirmed that the visibility of theseshifts can only be observed for specific imaging conditions and withina limited range of sample thickness. 22 refs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
