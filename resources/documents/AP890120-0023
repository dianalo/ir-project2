The findings will also permit prenatal diagnosis, they saidThursday.   Early diagnosis will allow doctors to act early to reduce theseverity of the disease, which causes tumors to grow anywhere in thenervous system, and can lead to severe disfigurement, deafness,blindness, brain cancers and spinal deformity.   Some 40 percent to 60 percent of patients also suffer learningdisabilities.   The findings are ``going to usher in a new era in us being ableto provide services of various types for people with thisdisorder,'' said Allan Rubenstein, medical director of the NationalNeurofibromatosis Foundation.   The disease, formally called neurofibromatosis 1, strikes inabout one in every 4,000 live births.   About half the new cases of the disease result from inheritingthe neurofibromatosis gene, while the other half occurspontaneously. Diagnostic testing based on the new research willwork only in people with a family history of the disease.   Finding the gene would allow testing of other people as well,said Francis Collins of the University of Michigan. And onceresearchers isolate the gene and analyze its workings, they shouldget hints about how to counter its effects on the body, which couldlead to better treatments, he said.   The research is reported in the January issue of The AmericanJournal of Human Genetics by an international consortium ofresearchers, led by Collins, Bernd Seizinger of Harvard MedicalSchool and Bruce Ponder of Royal Marsden Hospital in England.   The scientists followed up on the 1987 discovery that the genecausing the disorder lay somewhere within a portion of chromosome17, one of the 23 versions of the thread-like structures that carryhuman hereditary information.   Their new work narrows the possible location of the gene to about5 percent of the chromosome. They found genetic signposts, calledmarkers, that lie close to the gene on each side.   Since the markers tend to be inherited along with the gene,people who have them are highly likely to carry the gene as well.   The markers will be useful for early or prenatal diagnosis in anestimated 80 percent to 90 percent of families that have had a caseof neurofibromatosis, said Rubenstein.   Diagnosis is now based on symptoms. Suggestive early signs of thedisease are often noticed shortly after birth. But in about aquarter of cases, a diagnosis cannot be confirmed until adolescence,when other symptoms appear, said Rubenstein.   In addition, he said, perhaps about 10 percent of the nation's atleast 100,000 neurofibromatosis cases lack classical symptoms, sothat no definite diagnosis can be made. That poses a problem as aperson approaches childbearing years and wants to know if he or shecarries the faulty gene, which could be passed to a child,Rubenstein said.   By diagnosing neurofibromatosis before symptoms appear, doctorswill know who should be followed closely with physical examinations,looking for problems that can be treated before they cause serioustrouble, said John Carey, associate professor of pediatrics at theUniversity of Utah.   While prenatal diagnosis raises the possibility of an abortion,that decision is complicated by the fact that most people withneurofibromatosis live a normal life without serious medicalproblems, Carey said.   Rubenstein said about half of people with the disease have minorskin lesions and learning disabilities but no major medicalproblems, another quarter have significant but correctable medicalproblems, and the balance have severe and untreatable medicalproblems.   The disease gained its nickname from a disfigured 19th CenturyEnglishman who was exhibited at side shows as the Elephant Man. Butsince then, researchers have determined he actually had a differentdisease.</TEXT></DOC>
