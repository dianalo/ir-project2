<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-47-1052 </DOCNO><TEXT>The current procedure in the Federal Republic of Germany for determiningthe annual heat consumption of heating installations does not take correctlyenough into account after the introduction of the heat protection decree,the relation between meeting the heating energy consumption by way ofdistrict heating and by way of the heating plant. It was, therefore,necessary to work out a new calculation method. A detailed survey ofthis describes first of all the historical development of this calculationmethod and deals with the thermal management of heated buildings (heatlosses, heat requirement, annual heating energy consumption). Further,designed sizes for the maximal annual heating energy consumption weredetermined and this calculation method was investigated experimentally.In conclusion, a new calculation method is suggested for the annual heatingenergy consumption.
