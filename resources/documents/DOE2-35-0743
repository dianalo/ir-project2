The buoyancy flow, which is notdue to density variations of the fluid, and the forced convection, whichacts on the viscosity variations, will cause the two-fluid interfaceto tilt. The basic case of a plane interface between two immiscible fluidsof different density and viscosity in an infinite anisotropic aquiferbounded by two horizontal planes is analyzed in detail. The ground waterflow in the aquifer is treated as a superposition of buoyancy flow andforced convection. The buoyancy flow and the forced-convection componentsare shown by analytical methods to be related to each other. The tiltingangle of the two-fluid interface is given by a simple formula containingonly two parameters. There exists a certain stationary tilting angle,the stability of which depends on the two viscosities.</TEXT></DOC>
