Carbonmonoxide hydrogenation was performed in a differential reactor operatingat atmospheric pressure, temperature of 250-350 degrees C and a hydrogen:carbon monoxide ratio of 3. Temperature-programmed surface reaction ofcarbon deposits with hydrogen and Auger electron spectroscopy were employedto obtain a better understanding of the nature of the carbon deposits.With increasing deposition temperature, the amount of carbon depositincreased and the atomic surface carbon transformed morphologically intopolymeric and graphitic carbon. Carbon deposits resulted in the reductionof activation energy from 28-32 to 17-18 kcal/mol (117-134 to 71-75 kJ/mol)as well as significantly decreasing activity. Hydrocarbon product distributionswere not affected by carbon deposits, but the obvious shift in selectivityfrom paraffins to olefins was observed with increasing carbon deposits.5 figs., 30 refs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
