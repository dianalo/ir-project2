Building in Downsview, Ontario, using theMeriwether Energy System Analysis (ESA) Series of computer programs.This report presents the total energy consumption computed for the A.E.S.building using the ESA series, as currently operating; the findings ofthe survey carried out on January 5,6 and 7, 1977; a discussion of thesignificance of the indicated savings by judicious application of theenergy conservation techniques; and recommendations to effect energysavings. The study shows that while the A.E.S. building has a computedconsumption of 79 kWh/ft/sup 2/ of equivalent energy (gas heating, electriccooling) a reasonable energy budget for the building is 32 kWh/ft/sup2/, a reduction of approximately 60%. This reduction in energy consumptioncan be achieved by implementing primarily the operational changes recommended,the cost of which would be recoverd in a few months through savings achieved.The conclusions drawn from the study suggest that even in a recentlybuilt building there is considerable potential for energy savings, andoperational changes requiring little or no captial expenditure can bevery effective in reducing energy consumption. The study has also shownthat many of the improvements could have been identified without resortto computer simulation. However, such a detailed analysis is necessaryto accurately evaluate the energy savings of these improvements or theviablility of modifications of questionable benefit. 7 figs., 11 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
