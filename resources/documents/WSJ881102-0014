Next they threw live birds into the scoops. Then they got brutal, and loosed a group of tool-wielding teen-agers on the machines.    These are a few ways aerospace engineers tested a new helicopter engine, and the engine prevailed. The T800 engine, developed by a joint venture of General Motors Corp. and Allied-Signal Inc. last week won the contract to power a new generation of light helicopters that the Army plans to buy over the next decade.    The engine marks a leap in performance, simplicity and reliability for helicopter turbines, the Army said. The T800 program also represents the Army's largest engine purchase and the first contract to power Army helicopters to go to Allied-Signal, Morristown, N.J. First delivery of the T800 is set for 1995, with a planned purchase of 5,000 units by 2005.    The key advantage of the T800 over current helicopter turbines is its ability to inhale vast amounts of debris through its air intakes without stalling, and a design so simple the average Army mechanic could tackle most repairs without special training, says the service and the builders.    Current Army helicopter engines require trained mechanics to handle even routine maintenance. However, its producers say most T800 repairs can be performed by anyone using a set of six hand tools. Any of 80 major engine parts can be replaced in 10 minutes using one of the tool kit's wrenches. &quot;It would be like changing the starter on your car,&quot; says Lt. Col. Sandy Weand, assistant manager of the Army program. Problems that previously would require helicopters to be returned to rear area maintenance centers could be repaired near the front line of combat, he says.    To test the serviceability of the T800, the GM-Allied-Signal venture, called Light Helicopter Turbine Engine Co., invited a high school automotive mechanics class in Mesa, Ariz., to tear down and reassemble the engine. Joseph A. Byrd, program director at the joint venture, says the service manuals were written at a fifth-grade reading level. But the students &quot;wanted something simpler, so we shortened it.&quot;    As a result of experience in the Middle East, the Army wanted the T800 to be able to withstand larger volumes of sand and other debris. To that end, designers developed a 95% efficient inlet particle separator that deflects foreign material to an overboard dump. The T800's larger front-end compressor blades, meanwhile, are desiged to survive collisions with any additional debris. &quot;It can chew up most things that we can throw into it,&quot; including the sand, ice cubes, and live birds used in tests, Mr. Byrd says.    Under the two-year, $75.4 million contract the St. Louis-based joint venture will complete development work on the engine. Then GM's Allison Gas Turbine division and Allied-Signal's Garrett Engine division will vie for separate production contracts with an estimated total value of $2 billion. Allied-Signal sees a market valued at about $4 billion for the T800 over the next two decades in civilian and foreign military sales. </TEXT></DOC>
