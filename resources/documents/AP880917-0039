Heavy rains from the storm also drowned eight people inHonduras, where officials said about 6,000 people were homeless and27,000 acres of crops were destroyed.   The eye of the hurricane crossed onto land at 5:35 p.m. EDT(4:35 p.m. CDT), sweeping ashore 120 miles south of Brownsville,Texas, the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said ina statement. Brownsville is just across the Rio Grande fromMatamoros, a city of 280,000 people.   Gilbert _ a 450-mile-wide hurricane with winds of 120 mph _ madelandfall just north of La Pesca, a fishing village on the Gulf ofMexico. The coastal plain in that zone is sparsely populated.   The confirmed Mexico death toll rose to 21, Jorge Galicia of theNational Civil Defense System told The Associated Press earlySaturday. All occurred in the three Yucatan peninsula states ofCampeche, Yucatan and Quintana Roo.   Authorities said Friday that 10 people were missing in theYucatan state.   The mayor of Soto la Marina, 20 miles inland from La Pesca, wascontacted by The Associated Press as the storm struck his town of8,000 residents.   Mayor Hinojosa Cortina said the situation in Soto la Marina was``getting worse with every passing minute. There are very strongwinds. It's all dark. There is no electricity and no water. Treeshave been uprooted.''   Cortina said some residents had fled the town in advance of thehurricane but many remained. Other town officials said 3,000 peoplefrom fishing villages along the coast were given shelter in Soto laMarina.   Many streets in Matamoros were flooded and officials said about5,000 people fled their homes in low-lying coastal areas.   At 9 p.m. EDT (8 p.m. CDT), the eye of the hurricane was nearlatitude 24.4 north, longitude 98.1 west, or about 110 miles southsouthwest of Brownsville, the National Hurricane Center said.   It said Gilbert was moving toward the west-northwest at 12 mph.The report said flash floods and tides of 7 to 11 feet above normalwere expected near and to the north of where the storm came ashore.   Monterrey, an industrial city with a population of about threemillion, is the closest major city that could be affected. It is210 miles northwest of La Pesca but Sierra de Tamaulipas, a smallmountain range between Monterrey and the coast, should blunt thehurricane's strentth, said Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at NationalHurricane Center.   He said the range should break up circulation of hurricane andaccelerate drop in wind speed, which naturally occurs when stormmoves over land. But Zimmer said he expects very heavy rains aswarm hurricane winds rise into cooler mountain air. This couldcause flash floods and mudslides, he said.   The hurricane struck the Mexican coast first Wednesday morning,roaring into the Yucatan Peninsula.   About 300,000 people were homeless in Yucatan State and 10,000more were homeless in Campeche on the west coast of the peninsula,the government news agency Notimex said.   The mayor of Cancun, on the east coast of the peninsula, said11,000 tourists and residents were evacuated from beachfront areasbefore the storm hit.   Power and communications were still out in much of Yucatan,thousands of people remained in shelters, many areas were floodedand transportation was only partially restored.   The Cancun and Cozumel airports opened Friday, allowing 8,000tourists to begin leaving the popular Caribbean resorts.   The damage ``looks awesome and spectacular,'' Tourism SecretaryAntonio Enriquez Savignac said during an appearance on the privateTelevisa network Friday after returning from a flight over the area.   Matamoros, only 25 feet above sea level and 12 miles from shore,lacks natural wind breaks such as hills or high buildings.Authorities said their main worry was flooding, which alreadyaffected some streets.   Officials said about 5,000 people spent Thursday night inshelters. Countless others already have fled the city for townsfarther inland, while thousands waited out the hurricane behindboarded or taped doors and windows.   ``Our house started flooding, so we called the police and theybrought us here,'' said Maria Crecencia Vazquez, a 45-year-oldmother of 10 who sought shelter in a church meeting hall, one of126 shelters set up in Matamoros.   The refugees, mostly poor families, said they spent all nightThursday in the shelters without food or blankets.   ``They closed a lot of stores because too many people werepacking in,'' said Jose Padilla, 29. ``Most of us didn't get anyfood.''   The Matamoros airport was closed at midmorning.   About 100 miles south of La Pesca, heavy winds and rains poundedthe oil port of Tampico where 30 ships were anchored. Power was cutin some areas and the airport and coastal highway were closed,according to El Sol de Tampico, the local paper.   Nearly 1,000 miles away from Matamoros, across the Gulf ofMexico, much of the Yucatan Peninsula was in tatters.   Glbert caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages as itrolled across three states of the peninsula destroying 90 per centof the corn and fruit crops.   But tourism officials were optimistic they could put Cancun andCozumel back in working order in six weeks, in time for the heightof the fall and winter season.</TEXT></DOC>
