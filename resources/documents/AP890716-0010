We, the heads of state or government of seven major industrialnations and the president of the Commission of the EuropeanCommunities, have met in Paris for the 15th annual Economic Summit.The Summit of the Arch initiates a new round of summits to succeedthose begun at Rambouillet in 1975 and at Versailles in 1982. Theround beginning in 1982 has seen one of the longest periods ofsustained growth since the Second World War. These summits havepermitted effective consultations, offered the opportunity to launchinitiatives and to strengthen international cooperation.   2. This year's world economic situation presents three mainchallenges:   _The choice and the implementation of measures needed to maintainbalanced and sustained growth, counter inflation, create jobs andpromote social justice. These measures should also facilitate theadjustment of external imbalances, promote international trade andinvestment, and improve the economic situation of developingcountries.   _The development and the further integration of developingcountries into the world economy. Whilst there has been substantialprogress in many developing countries, particularly thoseimplementing sound economic policies, the debt burden and thepersistence of poverty, often made worse by natural disastersaffecting hundreds of millions of people, are problems of deepconcern which we must continue to face in a spirit of solidarity.   _The urgent need to safeguard the environment for futuregenerations. Scientific studies have revealed the existence ofserious threats to our environment such as the depletion of thestratospheric ozone layer, excessive emissions of carbon dioxide andother greenhouse gases which could lead to future climate changes.Protecting the environment calls for a determined and concertedinternational response and for the early adoption, worldwide, ofpolicies based on sustainable development.</TEXT><NOTE>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC SITUATION</NOTE><TEXT>   3. Growth has been sustained by focusing policies on improvingthe efficiency and flexibility of our economies and by strengtheningour cooperative efforts and the coordination process. In the mediumterm, the current buoyant investment seen during this period shouldpave the way for an increased supply of goods and services and helpreduce the dangers of inflation. The outlook is not, however,without risks.   4. Until now, the threat of inflation in many countries has beencontained, thanks to the concerted efforts of governments andmonetary authorities. But continued vigilance is required andinflation, where it has increased, will continue to receive a firmpolicy response so that it will be put on a downward path.   5. While some progress has been made in reducing externalimbalances, the momentum of adjustment has recently weakenedmarkedly; there needs to be further progress in adjusting externalimbalances through cooperation.   6. In countries with fiscal and current account deficits,including the United States of America, Canada and Italy, furtherreductions in budget deficits are needed. Action will be taken tobring them down. This may help reduce the savings-investment gap andexternal imbalances, contribute to countering inflation andencourage greater exchange rate stability in a context of decreasinginterest rates.   7. Countries with external surpluses, including Japan andGermany, should continue to pursue appropriate macroeconomicpolicies and structural reforms that will encourage non-inflationarygrowth of domestic demand and facilitate external adjustment.   8. All our countries share the responsibility for the sounddevelopment of the world economy. Over the medium term, deficitcountries have to play a key role in global adjustment through theirexternal adjustment and increased exports; surplus countries have tocontribute to sustaining global expansion through policies providingfavorable conditions for growth of domestic demand and imports.   9. The emergence of the newly industrializing economies and theinitiation of a dialogue with them are welcome. We call on thosewith substantial surpluses to contribute to the adjustment ofexternal imbalances and the open trade and payments system. To thatend, they should permit exchange rates to reflect their competitiveposition, implement GATT commitments and reduce trade barriers.</TEXT><NOTE>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS AND COORDINATION</NOTE><TEXT>   10. Under the Plaza and Louvre agreements, our countries agreedto pursue, in a mutually reinforcing way, policies of surveillanceand coordination aimed at improving their economic fundamentals andat fostering stability of exchange rates consistent with thoseeconomic fundamentals.   There has been progress in the multilateral surveillance andcoordination of economic policies with a view to ensuring internalconsistency of domestic policies and their internationalcompatibility. The procedures to be used have been more clearlydefined and improved in cooperation with the International MonetaryFund.   11. The coordination process has made a positive contribution toworld economic development and it has also contributed greatly toimproving the functioning of the International Monetary System.There has also been continued cooperation in exchange markets.   It is important to continue, and where appropriate, to developthis cooperative and flexible approach to improve the functioningand the stability of the International Monetary System in a mannerconsistent with economic fundamentals. We therefore ask the financeministers to continue to keep under review possible steps that couldbe taken to improve the coordination process, exchange marketcooperation, and the functioning of the International MonetarySystem.   12. We welcome the decision to complete the work on the ninthreview of the International Monetary Fund quotas with a view to adecision on this matter before the end of the years.   We note that the question of a resumption of SDR allocationremains under consideration in the Executive Board of theInternational Monetary Fund.   13. Within the European Community, the European Monetary Systemhas contributed to a significant degree of economic policyconvergence and monetary stability.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
