On Friday, department officials had said they hadn't known aboutthe accidents.   C. Anson Franklin, assistant secretary for congressional,intergovernmental and public affairs at the Energy Department, saidMonday that Du Pont had notified the Energy Department and itspredecessor agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, of the incidents.   ``The issue here was whether some information had been withheldfrom the Department of Energy, and there had been some suggestionsthat it had been,'' Franklin said. ``We looked into that today andfound that any such suggestions would be incorrect.''   The New York Times reported in today's editions on the newEnergy Department positions.   The safety of the Savannah River reactors, operated by Du Pontfor the Department of Energy, came under heavy criticism at acongressional hearing Friday.   A 1985 memorandum disclosed at the hearing listed 30 incidentsat the five Savannah River reactors between 1957 and 1985. Theyincluded one in which fuel rods melted and another in which a chainreaction nearly went out of control.   Energy Department officials said Friday that they had not beenaware of the series of incidents. But Du Pont issued a statementSunday saying it had notified the government of the incidentsthrough ``the formal reactor incident reporting system.''   Du Pont said it has provided daily and monthly operationsreports to DOE; maintained a formal reactor incident reportingsystem since 1957; provided semiannual summary reports of reactorincidents to Du Pont and DOE management for the past 20 years; andshared reactor incident report information with the news media.   Franklin said the reports on the incidents were filed with theregional office in Aiken, S.C., but the information apparentlynever got to the energy secretary or other top energy officials inWashington.   ``It's hard to say at this point, this many years after theevents, how the information was handled at the Department ofEnergy,'' Franklin said.   Asked whether such a problem could occur today, Franklin said,``All significant incidents would be reported to headquarters.''</TEXT></DOC>
