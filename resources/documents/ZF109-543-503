Each paragraph definesa step.andP;  If it ends with a colon, the next sections are choices, in if-thenform, which end in periods.andP;  If the paragraph ends in a question mark, thenext two sections must be yes or no.andP;  And so on.andM;What you see is what you meant?andM;AllClear then generates a flow chart of what you have described.andP;  The valueis both in the precision it imposes, and the clarity with which it displaysthe result.andP;  By forcing the syntax on you, it shows you the semantics so youcan see where you may have screwed up.andP;  (It can also arrange data from aspreadsheet or database into an orgchart or tree; for example, everyone withthe same salary or job title would be grouped together into one branch.)andM;AllClear is a tool for people to express knowledge they already have.andP;  How doyou fill out a Federal Express form? Where do you file an expense report? (Orwhat checks do you go through to approve one?) Who handles the customercomplaints, and how does she resolve them? What steps do you take to announcea new product, organize a customer seminar, change a price or qualify a newsupplier? All of these tasks follow routine procedures, even though some ofthe steps  - such as mollifying a disgruntled customer over the phone orpicking a price for a new software product (such as AllClear, $300)  - maytake unique human skills or insight.andM;AllClear assumes the user could understand the process if only the steps werelaid out intelligibly.andP;  It deals with the development phase before the expertsystem or the groupware tool comes into play.andP;  Expert systems and groupwareare basically sets of rules and conditions; AllClear lets you see how it allfits together.andP;  AllClear solves the problem not of automating a process butof defining it properly, so that people can see what they're doing  - or whatthey're not doing.andP;  It provokes responses such as,  Oops, we never figuredout what to do if the recipient doesn't have fax or telex,&quot; or, &quot;So we saidwhat to do when people go on vacation, but how do we transfer the unfinishedwork back to them when they return?&quot;andM;Personally, weld like to use AllClear on those voice-mail systems that sendyou into the blue yonder after ten sets of  Press one if ...andP;  We're sure theproblem would become apparent right away.andP;  (The basic problem is that this isa system that should not be automated.andP;  You can never truly predict what arandom caller might want, and it's clear that many callers want a human.andO;Certainly, they do not want to travel up and down a cryptic menu tree  - atleast not until we all have picture phones and callers can see the menu.)andM;Think clearly before you automate !andP;  Technically, you could automate most ofthese procedures as an expert system, leading the user through a set ofquestions and giving him an answer (or someone to talk to) at the end, or asgroupware.andP;  They embody expertise that it would be nice to be able torepresent with software.andP;  However, frequently the point is not the answer atthe end, but the process itself, which may not need or may not submit easilyto automation.andP;  Second, traditional expert systems tend to keep the user inthe dark; they lead the user without telling him where he's heading and withthe implicit message that such things are too difficult for him tounderstand.andP;  That can be helpful if the process is extremely complex, butwith simple office procedures it's frequently helpful rather than confusingto see the paths laid out.andM;Doing market research for the product, Clear's Yasinovsky was surprised tofind out how many flow charts are actually in use - pilots' manuals,product-assembly instructions, a tax manual from the Financial AccountingStandards Board (200 pages of them out of 700 pages in total), patentapplications  including Clear's own).andP;  And tree structures abound as well  -for org charts, bill of materials breakdowns, or anything that can also berepresented as an outline.andM;AllClear focuses on personal productivity before you even get to thecomputer.andP;  As you've heard before, if you automate a mess, you get anautomated mess.andP;  With AllClear, you may get rid of the mess before youautomate  - or discover you don't need to.andP;  It's that last step, automatingthe human work at each workbench, that's really hard (and is the province ofmost of the exotic software we write about).andP;  But delivering the right toolsto each workstation, and moving the work reliably from place to place so thatthe work can be done, is worth diagramming and doing well.andM;The fundamental problem isn't automating procedures, but designing the rightprocedures in the first place.andP;  AllClear can only show you whether yourprocedures work in logical sequence and can't assess whether they make sense,but it can make them visible, so that it's easier for a person to make thatdetermination.andP;  The structure may be sound, but it's only when you see boththe trees and the forest together that you can determine if it makes sense.andM;Often, it's enough to represent a process, and maybe speed it along,electronically, but you still want humans making most of the decisions ordoing most of the talking  - on that phone system with customers, forexample.andP;  You still want people, not robots, to interact with customers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
