Officials arrested 78 Vietnamese who came ashore, under a toughnew policy to stop the influx of boat people to this tiny Britishcolony. The detainees will be returned to Vietnam unless they canprove they face political or religious persecution back home.   Britain's ambassador to Vietnam, Emrys Davies, told reporters inHong Kong that Hanoi ``saw enormous difficulties'' in taking backlarge numbers of boat people and had given no indication it wouldaccept them by the early 1990s.   Davies said Hanoi is punishing people who organize the exodusfrom Vietnam but added that it was difficult to patrol Vietnam'slong coastline.   Since the Vietnam War ended in 1975 with the communists takingover the goverment, Hong Kong has considered all boat people to berefugees fleeing persecution. The policy was reviewed as the numberof Vietnamese arrivals rose to nearly 8,000 this year, of whichonly 1,200 have been resettled.   Government officials say prospects are dim for finding homes formore than 16,000 refugees now in Hong Kong camps.   Under the policy, boat people who fled for economic reasons willbe detained until they can be sent back to Vietnam. Those who canprove they faced persecution in Vietnam will be granted refugeestatus and become eligible for resettlement.   One of the Vietnamese who was detained told reporters that hisboat carried more than 30 relatives. Nguyen Dai Quy said he did notknow of the new policy when he left his home in central Vietnam twoweeks ago but would have fled anyway.   The 32-year-old man said he was a political refugee, noting thatthe Communist government did not allow him to pursue deep seafishing and that his children could not attend school. He claimedhis mother was killed by Viet Cong and he was a volunteer soldierfor the pro-American South Vietnam army during the war.   ``I hope the Hong Kong government will change its policy and letme get out,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
