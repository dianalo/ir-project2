The methodis based on measurement of the initial rate of gas emission in boreholesdrilled into the coal mass, and relies on 2 phenomena: lower gas permeabilitywith higher stress, and higher gas levels at greater depths into thecoal mass. In the first section of a borehole the increasing gas levelwill lead to greater emission. Then a fall may ensue as rock pressurereduces permeability. In this section there may be a rock burst hazard.Any fall in the emission rate after an initial rate of 0.8 l/min shouldbe regarded as indicating a possible hazard. In the underground testsseveral major and minor rock bursts were successfully forecast. Althoughthere was a high incidence (64%) of hazard indications which were notfollowed by actual bursts, the method was nevertheless accurate in forecastingbursts which did occur.</TEXT></DOC>
