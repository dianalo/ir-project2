Both legislatures voted overwhelmingly in favor.;    Themoves provoked a sharp reaction in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital. The federalParliament issued a statement urging the army &quot;to undertake measures toprevent the division of Yugoslavia and changes in its borders.&quot;;    TheParliament may have overstepped its authority because it normally has nocontrol over the army. That is reserved for the federal presidency, which hasbeen paralyzed by the Yugoslav crisis and has not met for weeks.;    Bydeclaring their independence, Croatia and Slovenia threaten to inflamelongstanding ethnic tensions, worsen Yugoslavia's grave economic problems andeven plunge the patchwork nation into a civil war.;    The twoWestern-oriented republics have long pushed for a loose federation against theobjections of hard-line leaders from Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's sixrepublics. Croatia and Slovenia have already held referendums in whichsecession won overwhelming support.;    In Zagreb, Zarko Domjan, speaker ofCroatia's parliament, said: &quot;Croatia no longer remains within federativeYugoslavia.&quot;;    Croatia 'independent';  A copy of Croatia's declarationobtained by the Associated Press said the republic was a &quot;sovereign andindependent state.&quot;;    &quot;By this act, the Republic of Croatia initiates theprocess of disassociation from the other republics&quot; and Yugoslavia, thedocument says.;    It says Croatia's present borders were valid. Thatprovision was an apparent reaction to threats by neighboring Serbia to annexparts of Croatia with a large ethnic Serb population.;    Violence betweenSerbs and Croats, the country's two largest ethnic groups, has claimed thelives of at least 22 people in Croatia since early May, and all groups in thecountry are arming.;    The 500,000-strong Serbian minority in Croatia, whichclaims it is discriminated against, formed enclaves and declared themindependent earlier this year. They had said that the regions, comprisingabout a 25 percent of Croatia's territory, will remain part of Yugoslavia ifCroatia separates.;     Decision moved up;  Croatia and Slovenia originallyplanned to declare independence Wednesday, and the decision to act earlier onthe legislation was not explained. But it raised speculation that it was anattempt to put the federal government and Serbia off balance.;    Now that therepublics have declared independence, fierce fighting between Serbs and Croatscould ripple through the rest of Yugoslavia and the rest of the Balkans, whichhave a history of internecine violence.;    Yugoslavia, a country of fourofficial languages and at least 24 ethnic groups, has been fragile since itwas first formed in 1918.;    After the communists were swept from powerthroughout eastern Europe in 1989, Yugoslavia also moved toward democracy andelections were held in all six republics last year.;    Yugoslav Premier AnteMarkovic warned Monday in Zagreb that his government would &quot;use all legalmeans&quot; to stop the two republics from breaking away. But he also said forcewould not be used.;    Slovenia's new legislation will produce few majorimmediate changes. There will be no Slovene passports, no new bank notes andabout 20,000 federal army troops will remain stationed on Slovene territory.;   But the new legislation unilaterally annuls the validity of the YugoslavConstitution on Slovene territory.;    It establishes a Slovene central bank,which authorities say could issue its own currency within eight months. Italso transfers customs authorities and air traffic control, previously underfederal jurisdiction, to Slovenia.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Zagreb, Yugoslavia  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910625  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  611  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday June 25, 199100177108,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
