Under a 1983 addition to the tax code, a small number of Social Security recipients must pay taxes on part of their benefits if their otherwise-exempt interest on state and local securities exceeds a certain level.    New York City and other local governments claim that the provision is an indirect and unconstitutional federal tax.    The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, ruled against New York City's position. The court said the federal tax provision doesn't violate the intergovernmental tax-immunity doctrine.    A spokesman for Harrison J. Goldin, New York City's comptroller, said that despite the unfavorable ruling, the city is going ahead with another federal suit, challenging the inclusion of certain exempt interest on local bonds in computing federal liability under the federal rules.    The appeals court ruled that while the federal government's rule is tied to how much interest a taxpayer earns on local bonds, it actually taxes only Social Security benefits. The court called such a provision an &quot;indirect burden&quot; that doesn't violate the tax-immunity doctrine.    The appeals court decision was written by Circuit Judge Wilfred Feinberg.    The controversy involves a section of the Internal Revenue Code, enacted by Congress in 1983, that was designed to tax a portion of Social Security benefits received by people who have substantial income from other sources. </TEXT></DOC>
