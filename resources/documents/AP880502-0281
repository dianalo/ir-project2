The Saudis appear increasingly intent on frustrating Iran'sefforts to galvanize a consensus for oil production cuts that couldsend prices higher this summer.   The result may be more in-fighting for the fractiousOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and perhaps an evendeeper political paralysis.   Prices fell sharply Monday after OPEC decided to suspend talkson a proposed 2 percent cutback in oil production until June.   Most industry observers had expected the Saudis to go along withthe cutback, since it was so small as to have virtually no effecton OPEC evenues. An eight-country majority supported the cuts,which were to be taken in conjunction with cutbacks by a group ofsix independent oil-producing nations.   The fact that Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer stood fast againstthe cuts appeared to mean the cartel's most influential member isunwilling to accept any OPEC action that could lay the foundationfor an Iranian-led price increase.   Last December the Saudis successfully defeated an Iranianproposal to raise OPEC's official price by $2.70 a barrel, to$20.70.   Iran relies heavily on oil export revenues to finance its7{-year-old war against Iraq. Saudi Arabia has helped bankroll theIraqi war effort.   Paul Mlotok, who monitored the OPEC meeting for the New Yorkinvestment firm Salomon Brothers Inc., said he expected oil pricesto slump this week and then hold steady until OPEC's June meeting.   Iran and other OPEC members had hoped that by cutting back alittle on production now, when world oil demand is relatively weak,prices would rebound and then jump even higher this summer duringthe traditional peak season for fuel consumption.   By preventing an accord at the Vienna meeting, the Saudisprobably ensured that any summer price increases will be small,limiting the benefit for Iran.   ``This was, for the Saudis, a clear political victory,'' saidBahman Karbassioun, a Vienna-based oil consultant and former memberof the OPEC staff.   He said he believed the Saudis never had any intention duringthe Vienna meeting of striking a compromise deal.   ``It was a very well organized and well planned'' effort by theSaudis to deny Iran the agreement it badly wanted, he said.   Last week, two days before the OPEC meeting started, the Saudigovernment announced it was breaking diplomatic relations withIran. It accused Tehran of engaging in terrorism and subversion.   Kazempour Ardebili, the deputy Iranian oil minister, said afterthe Saudi announcement that it may have been intended to spoil theatmosphere of the Vienna meeting.   Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of the Iranian Majlis, orparliament, on Sunday said the Saudi stalling on oil productioncuts amounted to ``flagrant treachery'' orchestrated by the UnitedStates.   Saudi Arabia and Iran have been rivals for power and influencewithin OPEC from the early days of the cartel, which was formed in1960 but did not gain a grip on pricing until the Arab oil embargoof 1973.   In 1986, however, the Saudis and Iranians appeared to reach atacit understanding to work together following a price crash thatsent oil below $10 a barrel.   The fragile alliance began to unravel last summer after riotingat the holy city of Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, killed 402 people, mostof them Iranian.   As long as relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia remain poor,OPEC is likely to encounter major problems holding oil pricessteady, let alone raising them to the official target of $18 abarrel.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Robert Burns has covered OPEC for The AssociatedPress since 1982.</TEXT></DOC>
