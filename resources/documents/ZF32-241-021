(NSA) plans to release next month anew package for X.25 networks.andM;AdaptX25 will let PC users communicate with IBM mainframe applications overinexpensive dial-up asynchronous links and X.25 public data networks such asTymnet from British Telecom/Tymnet.andP;  AdaptX25 operates with NSA's line ofSystems Network Architecture protocol software, including DOS andWindows-based 3270 terminal emulators, LU 6.2 program-to-program software, aremote job entry emulator and LU O softward, company officials said.andM;The product is intended primarily for two markets: the growing number oflaptop users who require access to IBM mainframe applications from the road,and worldwide firms that require access to mainframes in countries where X.25is prevalent, said Raymond Chan, vice president of sales and marketing forthe Laguna Hills, Calif., firm.andM;One of the largest banks in the Netherlands, for example, is now testingAdaptX25 and hopes to use the software as an inexpensive method for PC usersto access mainframe applications.andM;&quot;Up to now we've used HLLAPI with 3270 for PC-to-host access, but theultimate plan is to use LU 6.2 to do file transfer between PCs and Tandems,&quot;said Keith McKay, a software engineer for NMB Postbank Group NV in Amsterdam.andO;&quot;NSA supports everything that we need.&quot;andM;AdaptX25 comprises NSA's X.25 Control Program (XCP) running in a PC attachedto the IBM host via a Synchronous Data Link Control or Token-Ring adapter.andO;The PC also requires an IBM ARTIC adapter for connecting to the X.25 network.andO;Remote PCs access AdaptX25 via an async modem and the desired NSA protocolsoftware.andM;The XCP software--certified by Tymnet and being tested by other public datanetworks--will be available next month in the United States directly fromNSA, and internationally through distributors, for $2,995.andM;NSA can be reached at (714) 768-4013.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
