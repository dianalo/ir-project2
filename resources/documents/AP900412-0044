Wednesday's statement was the most adamant by Contra leaderIsrael Galeano since his subordinates signed an agreement withaides of President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro to disarm byher inauguration April 25.   U.N. peacekeeping forces began arriving in Honduras on Monday tooversee the demobilization of the 12,000 Nicaraguan rebels, most ofwhom were in border camps in this nation until recently.   But Galeano said his troops will not hand over their guns to thepeacekeepers.   ``Mrs. Chamorro defeated the Sandinistas in elections, but Ibelieve she will not be able to impose her authority on theSandinistas once she takes office,'' Galeano said.   He said his ``rebel army will honor its commitments and willabandon its camps in Honduras on April 18. But the army ofresistance will continue fighting in the mountains inside Nicaraguauntil their is true democracy in our nation.''   Mrs. Chamorro's conservative United National Opposition (UNO)defeated the 9-year-old leftist Sandinista government by alandslide in Feb. 25 elections.   There was no immediate comment by the Sandinistas on Galeano'sstatements, but the Nicaraguan government has said the refusal ofthe Contras to disband could threaten the transition.   They say the Contras must demobilize immediately and that theSandinista People's Army _ except for its top ranks _ should remainintact.   The Sandinistas and UNO have signed a transition protocol thatwould allow the Sandinistas to retain control of the army whilegiving it at least a semblance of political neutrality.   Under the accord, Mrs. Chamorro promises to respect ``theintegrity and professionalism'' of the armed forces, and all seniorofficers are barred from holding positions of leadership inpolitical parties.   About 9,000 armed Contras have infiltrated back into Nicaragua,leaving behind 1,000 wounded rebels and stragglers at their basecamps at the Honduran border town of Yamales.   The Contras and Mrs. Chamorro's representatives agreed Monday tostart dismantling the camps next Wednesday, under the supervisionof U.N. peacekeepers.   The Contras in Nicaragua were supposed to rally in ``safetyzones'' to surrender their weapons and disband under a cease-fire.   But Galeano said only the rebels who remain in Honduras willsurrender their weapons.   He criticized the peacekeepers for not finding funds to resettleContras and their relatives who were in Honduran camps.   ``They have taken no action to provide humanitarian aid for ourwounded and our relatives,'' Galeano said. ``We will need about$1.5 million monthly for that.''   He said the United States, which supported the Contras in theirnine-year war against the Sandinistas, should pay for resettlingthose who lay down their arms.   Contra spokesman Alejandro Acevedo said he and six other membersof a special rebel commission, including three civilians, would goto Managua on Monday to try to negotiate a truce.   Acevedo said the commission will meet with Roman CatholicCardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and Chamorro representatives _ butnot with the Sandinistas.</TEXT></DOC>
