May 10   The Daily Journal, Elizabeth, N.J., on stricter public housingrules:   Jack Kemp, secretary of the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment, ... issued new _ and controversial _ federal leasesthat allow the swift eviction of drug users and sellers from publichousing.   Opponents claim the new leases will be no more effective thanpresent rules ... (and) will create a new wave of homeless.   For instance, under the rules, an entire family could be evictedif a 14-year-old son were arrested for smoking marijuana.   However, Kemp's accelerated eviction process protects ...against arbitrary or unfair removal by providing a state courthearing.   No one claims the new rules are a panacea for this horriblesocial problem. But they are intended to protect people who live inpublic housing from being condemned to lives made miserable by thedrug trade.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 12   The Journal-Bulletin, Providence, R.I., on Panama:   General Noriega wasted litle time (last) week in protecting hisbad name.   After massive and ill-disguised efforts to steal (the previous)weekend's election, ... his puppet government declared the outcomevoid. And his personal shock troops, who call themselves theDignity Battalion, embarked on a rampage, choosing their victimswith extraordinary care.   President Bush is (sending) additional troops to the Canal Zone,ostensibly to protect American lives and interests. ...   Our worry is about subsequent steps: If the United States has nointention of taking military action against the Noriega regime ...then a show of force may be very easily transformed into ademonstration of weakness.   Let us hear ... from President Arias of Costa Rica, winner ofthe 1987 Nobel Prize for Peace. ...   Arias is happy to dispense advice about United States policytoward Nicaragua; we would be interested to know his reaction tothese remarkable events taking place just next door.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 15   The Pittsburgh Press on Janos Kadar:   If one man can be a traitor to and benefactor of his people,that figure is Hungary's former Communist Party chief Janos Kadar,who is 76, sick and senile and was kicked out of his last powerlesspost last week.   Kadar was a key minister in the government of Prime MinisterImre Nagy, a patriot who led a popular uprising against the SovietUnion in 1956. ...   (Kadar) then presided over the execution of Nagy and otherformer colleagues, having their bodies thrown in an unmarked massgrave. ...   Nagy's body was exhumed in March and will be given a properburial. Someday, when Hungary is truly independent, a monument willbe erected in his honor.   Perhaps something should also mark the memory of Janos Kadar,whose twisted way helped lead to a better Hungary.   Perhaps half a statue.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 15   Vicksburg (Miss.) Evening Post on the Soviet Central Committee:   Mikhail Gorbachev's bloodless purge of the ``dead souls'' on theSoviet Central Committee is no surprise. Many of the 110 memberswho were dropped had already been removed from their other highparty posts.   The surprise was the remarkable candor of Gorbachev's publicspeeches. He did not attempt to hide his anger and frustration overthe failure of his economic reforms: ``The state's financialposition is grave.''   Nor was Gorbachev slow in assigning blame: ``Wherever personnelchanges have become necessary ... they must be carried out withoutthe slighest hesitation.''   This threat to purge other party and government officials whosabotage reforms will have to be liberally carried out. In a way,this latest housecleaning of conservatives is the last of the easypurges. ...   The logical weapons for Gorbachev _ public outrage against localbosses and exposure in the news media of corrupt malingerers _could prove effective. The real trick for the Soviet leader is tofind enough local officials who will jump on the reform wagon toadvance their own careers. As in capitalism, Gorbachev must harnessenlightended self-interest and greed.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 16   Los Angeles Herald-Examiner on Bush's crime fight plan:   Mr. Kinder and Gentler just got tougher. Unfortunately, thepresident's anti-crime package ... isn't particularly smarter.   The half-step George Bush took on the assault-gun ban _ haltingthe import of the weapons, but allowing the manufacture of thoseinstruments of death made in the U. S. of A. _ is drawingattention. But what it deserves is close scrutiny, and revision.His other proposals aren't much better.   _ He called for building some 26,000 more jail cells. ... (But)most prison experts believe ... the new cells would still beinadequate to hold the overflow of criminals in America's federalprisons. ...   _ Bush also proposed an expansion of the number of federalcrimes punishable by death. We support the concept of capitalpunishment, but that penalty necessarily carries with itsignificant judicial oversight and review. Yet, the president seeksno new funding to increase federal judgeships.   _ New crime fighting positions would be created, including 1,600more federal prosecutors. ... But, again, when this new legal powerbegins making its busts, where will the convicted criminals belocked up? ...   The nation may not be able to afford the entire ($1.6 billion)package, but he can still do better. For instance, the assault-gunimport ban, linked with the proposed prohibition against 20-bulletclips for semiautomatics, must be expanded to include theAmerican-made arms as well. That's the kind of cost-free idea thatcould prove to be priceless in the fight against crime.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
