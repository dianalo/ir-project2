Salwen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BBK </IN><TEXT>   From January through September 1987, share buy-back programs came fast and furious, roughly equaling the total for all of 1986. Then the 10 post-crash weeks made the first nine months look like the Ice Age, as companies swooped to bolster investor confidence and scoop up their own stock at bargain-basement prices.    In all, more than 1,400 companies announced plans to buy back shares valued at more than $80 billion, according to the latest figures available from Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. That was more than double the number of 1986 transactions and nearly double the dollar value. If all the announced buy-backs are completed, more than 2.4 billion shares of stock will be removed from the market.    The surge in buy-backs further fuels the debate on whether they're good for corporate America. And that issue is likely to resurface again this year, with many observers predicting the buy-back pace won't slow at all.    Early in 1987, many companies used share buy-backs for restructurings, fending off predators, increasing returns on equity and slowing the dilution of their stock by employee stock-purchase plans.    But in the days following the Oct. 19 crash, hundreds of companies set buy-backs. &quot;It was almost a knee-jerk reaction to the crash,&quot; explained Charles J. Plohn Jr., Merrill's managing director for special transactions. &quot;A lot more companies have focused on buy-backs that never would have considered them earlier.&quot;    Some companies announced buy-backs with little intention of acquiring many shares, using the statements mainly as a way to bolster share prices for a shellshocked investor base. More often, the announcements were dual-purpose: Executives &quot;wanted to indicate management's confidence in the company, but they (also) viewed their stocks as undervalued,&quot; Mr. Plohn said.    Michael Metz, market strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., agreed that the blitz of late-October buy-back announcements &quot;was part of a public-relations campaign. But underneath that, they make a lot of sense,&quot; he contended.    After the crash, unusual opportunities arose for some firms. One company started its initial public offering just a few weeks before the crash, then found its stock selling so inexpensively after Black Monday that it announced a buy-back plan. &quot;We had to put stickers on the prospectus saying that the proceeds raised from the sale of these shares may be used to reacquire some of the stock,&quot; Mr. Plohn said.    At Citicorp, the September marketplace was ideal for raising the company's capital level by selling $1.2 billion of stock at $58.25 a share. But on Oct. 20, with its stock price languishing at $37.50, the banking concern announced that it would buy back as many as five million shares.    All this stepped-up activity came in for some criticism. Robert B. Reich, professor of political economy at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, contends that buy-backs are a poor use of a company's capital. &quot;Companies' time horizons have been growing shorter over the past 25 years,&quot; he said. &quot;Buy-backs pull the time horizon almost up to the front door.&quot;    Even some supporters of buy-backs have difficulty defending some recent purchases, such as those of financial-services firms or banks. &quot;The buy-backs that are healthy are the ones that make sense from a corporate standpoint,&quot; said William Harnisch, president of Forstmann-Leff Associates, a New York investment firm. &quot;I don't think its right for a bank to buy back stock when the main need is capital.&quot;    Mr. Harnisch contended, however, that buy-backs are healthy for companies with strong cash flow, such as food or drug companies. &quot;It makes a lot of sense as long as a company continues to grow,&quot; he says. &quot;Look at Ford (Motor Co.) They have plenty of cash and if you have a worst case scenario in the auto industry, they still have plenty of money coming in.&quot;    But Mr. Reich disagrees. The buy-back binge is &quot;an unhealthy and dangerous trend because it puts corporate America on much thinner ice, should there be a major hike in interest rates or a substantial fall in demand,&quot; he said. &quot;Investments in plants, equipment, research and development, employee training, modernization all are necessary if American corporations are to transform themselves into world-class competitors.&quot;    David Borger, director of research at Wilshire Asset Management, Los Angeles, said that companies get more return from stock buy-backs than from investment in a &quot;marginal plant.&quot; He added: &quot;The fact that they're buying back their own stocks really masks what they're doing. They're just choosing between two assets. Basically what it amounts to is making the most efficient use of your capital. Capital is a scarce commodity, too.&quot;    ---           Biggest Announced Stock Buybacks of 1987                                Common                                Shares    Company                 (in millions)         Value    General Motors               64.0        $4.72 billion    Santa Fe Southern Pacific    60.0         3.38 billion    Ford                         27.9         2.00 billion    Coca-Cola                    40.0         1.80 billion    Henley Group                 64.5         1.76 billion    Gencorp                      12.5         1.63 billion    IBM                          12.9         1.57 billion    American Express             40.0         1.35 billion    Allied-Signal                25.0         1.11 billion    Owens-Illinois               20.0         1.11 billion    J.C.
