<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-84-0815 </DOCNO><TEXT>An automated system for the testing and performance evaluation of high-resolutionlong-range time digitizers is described. The test system employs an IBMPC/XT or PC/AT personal computer together with appropriate hardware interfacingmodules to control the digitizer under test. Precise timing intervalsfor testing are generated by a pulse calibration module driven by a programmablelow phase noise frequency synthesizer. The time intervals measured bythe digitizer are then compared under computer control with the actualintervals produced by the synthesizer for a sufficient number of casesto establish the digitizer performance. The hardware and software componentsused are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
