The law passed Tuesday by the National Resistance Council, whichis not an elected body, defined insurgency as ``open and activerevolt against the government and its organs,'' according to the NewVision newspaper.   The report said people suspected of insurgency would be tried``within a reasonable time'' instead of being held indefinitely.   Attorney General Joseph Mulenga said Ugandan law has not untilnow provided for speedy trial. He cited the case of 800 rebelscaptured betweeen August and September 1986 who were in prisonindefinitely because the soldiers who were to testify against themwere fighting other rebels.
