Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., and Reps. Dennis Hertel, D-Mich.,and Don Ritter, R-Pa., arranged for a Capitol Hill reception to beheld Wednesday, sponsored by the Joint Baltic American NationalCommittee and the Baltic American Freedom League, marking BalticFreedom Day.   The Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia lost anestimated 20 percent of their population during World War II throughexecutions, mass deportations and flight out of the countries.   Baltic Freedom Day commemorates those Baltic republics and thepeople there who died at the hands of the Nazis and during theSoviet takeover in 1940.   Riegle said on Monday that the deportation issue ``has nothing todo with my interest and involvement over many years to try to bringabout what's happening, and that is the unraveling of the Russianempire.''   On Tuesday he issued a statement saying, ``I feel personally thatall war criminals must be brought to justice and punished, and Istrongly support the executive branch of our government on deportingsuspected war criminals when the facts warrant.''   Since the mid-1980s, the committee and the league have attemptedto block efforts by the Justice Department to deport war-crimessuspects to the Soviet Union for trial.   The groups, which deny they are pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic, saythey oppose the deportations because the Soviet system lacks dueprocess and the deportations may constitute diplomatic recognitionof the Soviet takeover.   The Joint Baltic American National Committee wants all warcriminals, whether communist or fascist, to be brought to justice,Mari-Ann Rikken, Estonian representative to the committee, saidMonday.   The organization is ``unhappy with the concept of making theSoviets an equal partner in justice,'' she said.   Chip Berlet of Political Research Associates, a researchinstitute based in Cambridge, Mass., that studies issues related toauthoritarianism and fascism, said some eastern European emigremovements split over the question of collaborating with the Nazism,and ``most of the movements that survived intact did so because ofcollaboration.''   After the Soviet Union absorbed the Baltic nations, theorganizations in exile sought to bury their differences in a commonanti-Soviet cause, Berlet said.   The organizations' anti-Soviet stance has pitted them against theJustice Department's Office of Special Investigations, which handlescases involving Nazi war crimes.   Anthony Mazeika, at the time vice president of the BalticAmerican Freedom League and now a director of the organization, wasactive in 1985 efforts to lobby against the OSI's search for warcriminals among Eastern European emigrants.   Mazeika and officers of the Joint Baltic American NationalCommittee, through an organization called the Coalition forConstitutional Justice and Security, also fought the OSI'sdeportation in 1987 of Karl Linnas of New York. Linnas was anEstonian who became an American citizen in 1959 and was sentenced todeath by a Soviet court after his conviction for the deaths ofthousands in a concentration camp in Estonia.   ``We are not saying that these people are innocent or thatperhaps there could be some guilt,'' said Angela Nelsas, vicepresident of the Baltic American Freedom League.   The organization would like to change the law ``so that Americancitizens can receive the same due process of law that is expected inthe United States,'' through criminal trials in the United States,she said. Neither Hertel nor Ritter responded to requests Monday andTuesday for comment.   The OSI said its only contact with the Baltic groups was whenthey were lobbying against a deportation. ``Frankly, I don't pay toomuch attention to them,'' said OSI head Neal Shear.</TEXT></DOC>
