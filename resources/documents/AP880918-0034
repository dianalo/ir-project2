SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A majority of Americans favor financialassistance for family planning programs in rapidly growing nations,according to a new poll done for a pair of population groups.   Sixty percent of adults polled by Louis Harris and Associatessaid the United States should fund foreign family planningprograms, regardless of whether abortion is legal in those nations.   But more than one-third of Americans, 34 percent, disagreed,according to the poll prepared for the Population Crisis Committeeand the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.   Providing financial support for family planning has been a boneof contention in recent years, with the Agency for InternationalDevelopment withdrawing support from countries where abortion is apart of the programs.   The agency halted funding to both the International PlannedParenthood Federation and the United Nation's Population Fund,contending that their policies promoted coercive abortion.   The two independent population groups paid for the poll of 1,250Americans in order to gauge the support for family planning in thispresidential election year. A poll of that size has a margin oferror of plus or minus 3 percentage points.   The study concluded that Americans are aware that the world'spopulation _ which last year topped the 5 billion mark _ is growingrapidly and that this poses many problems.   Some 91 percent of those polled think food shortages and famineswill get worse if populations in poor countries continue theirrapid increases, the study found.   Continued population growth will lead to more illegalimmigration to the United States, according to 89 percent of therespondents, while 87 percent predicted that there will be moreinternational crises and that more agricultural land will turn todesert and 69 percent foresee more U.S. jobs moving overseas.   Asked if the poor countries of Latin America, Africa and Asiashould have strong birth control programs, 89 percent agreed.Fifty-nine percent said such programs are in the United States'interest, and 60 percent approved U.S. money for the programs.</TEXT></DOC>
