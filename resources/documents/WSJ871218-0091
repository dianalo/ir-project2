Kendall resigned as president, chief executive officer and director.    A spokeswoman said Mr. Kendall, 44 years old, resigned at a regularly scheduled board meeting over &quot;a difference with the board of directors in management philosophy.&quot; She declined to elaborate, and Mr. Kendall, who had been with the company for 14 years, couldn't be reached for comment.    Paradyne said its board commenced a search for a successor and established an office of the chairman to run the company in the interim.    The maker of data-communications equipment said Chairman Paul J. Ferri will temporarily assume the additional position of chief executive, while Fred T. Melberg, executive vice president and acting chief operating officer, will be responsible for finance, manufacturing, human resources and corporate communications, among other things. The company also said John A. Koehler, senior vice president, will take responsibility for sales, marketing, customer service and product development, among other things.    The spokeswoman said she didn't believe the transition would be overly disruptive. &quot;The company has a definite product strategy and market strategy that will continue to evolve under current management, as well as, I would anticipate, under the new management,&quot; she said.    Mr. Kendall was elected president and chief executive in March to succeed Robert Wiggins, who resigned as part of a settlement of federal criminal fraud charges lodged against the company and eight executives. Mr. Ferri, 48, succeeded Mr. Wiggins as chairman at that time.    As previously reported, the company pleaded guilty to conspiracy and agreed to pay $1.2 million in fines and costs in settlement of charges that it conspired to defraud the Social Security Administration in connection with a 1981 contract by, among other things, making false statements about the state of development of its computer system.    Neither Mr. Kendall nor any of the officers named as members of the office of the chairman were charged in the controversy, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
