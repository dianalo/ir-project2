(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Titan 34D rocketthundered into space Sunday, carrying a classified payload an expertsaid was probably a pair of military communications satellites.   The powerful 16-story-tall booster blasted off under heavy cloudcover from Space Launch Complex 4 about 10:03 a.m, said Capt. JohnSullivan, a spokesman at Vandenberg, about 140 miles northwest ofLos Angeles.   As usual for military space flights, the Air Force didn'tannounce the launch in advance and did not identify the payload tobe put into orbit.   The Titan 34D probably carried two Satellite Data Systemsatellites, said John Pike, a space policy expert for theWashington-based Federation of American Scientists. He said it alsocould have carried either a KH-9 or KH-11 photoreconnaissance spysatellite.   Pike, who knew of the launch in advance, said Friday the SDSsatellites are used for military communications, especially in theevent the United States had to launch a nuclear attack.   The Titan 34D is America's most powerful space booster, althoughit soon will be replaced by the Titan 4, which is due for its maidenlaunch next year from Cape Canaveral, Fla.   Sunday's rocket was the last Titan 34D that will be launched fromVandenberg. Two more are scheduled for launch from Cape Canaveralearly next year.   The last launch of a Titan 34D was from Florida on Sept. 2, butsources told The Associated Press it failed to orbit its payloadbecause the rocket's third stage failed to reignite.   Titan 34Ds were grounded for 18 months following two successiveexplosions during launches from Vandenberg in 1985 and 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
