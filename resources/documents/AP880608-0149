Smith, of the National Research Council in Ottawa, Canada.   ``What I am reporting ... is the use of a chemical techniquethat will help the medical profession with both of thoseproblems,'' said Smith, who outlined his findings Tuesday inToronto during the Third Chemical Congress of North America. TheLos Angeles Times reported Smith's findings Wednesday.   If the technique shows a tumor will not spread, or metastasize,the tumor can be surgically removed without the need fordebilitating radiation or chemotherapy, Smith said.   It also might help doctors avoid unnecessary radicalmastectomies, in which surgeons remove a cancerous breast, lymphnodes in the armpit and muscles linking the upper chest andshoulder, he added.   Doctors now make a subjective judgment about whether a cancerwill spread, based on the size of the tumor and the appearance oftumor cells under a microscope.   The method cited by Smith is known as nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR) spectroscopy, which is a variation on NMR imaging, also knownas magnetic resonance imaging.   Despite their name, NMR imaging machines don't involveradiation, as do X-ray machines, and produce images of much higherquality. They have been used to detect tumors, subtle signs ofParkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, and various diseaseprocesses in the heart, liver and kidneys.   Chemists have used NMR spectroscopy for more than 30 years todetermine the structure of molecules. When a chemical is placed inthe NMR device's powerful magnetic field and bombarded withradio-frequency energy, scientists can deduce the structure of thechemical by measuring which frequencies of energy are absorbed.   Smith and Caroline E. Mountfors, of Australia's University ofSydney, found rat tumors that got rid of the absorbed energyextremely rapidly never metatasized, while those that shed theenergy slowly had a high probability of spreading to other sites inthe rats' bodies.   Studies of breast and colon tumors removed from 167 patients atOttawa General Hospital and Ottawa Civic Hospital during the pastthree years confirmed the value of the method, Smith said.   There has been no spread of cancer in 25 patients whose tumorsshed absorbed energy quickly, while all the others _ whose excisedtumors got rid of energy slowly _ either had metastases at the timeof surgery or developed them later, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
