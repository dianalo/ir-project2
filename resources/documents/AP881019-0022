SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Laser-protected homes, pocket telephones andinteractive television will be commonplace in the United States ofthe future, but the nation could face a potentially devastatingAIDS epidemic and a growing threat from high-tech terrorists,researchers say.   In its annual summary of predictions, the World Future Societysays AIDS could have the impact of a world war by the end of thecentury.   The predictions for 1989 and beyond summarize, but do notdetail, reports published during the past year by the society, anon-profit educational group based in Bethesda, Md., whichencourages study of issues affecting the future.   On the positive side, the society foresees technologicaladvances in the home, improved quality of life in America's cities,and better working conditions as corporations give more attentionto job satisfaction.   Workers over age 50 will find a growing demand for theirstability and experience, the report said.   Company policies in support of families will become much morecommon as the Baby Boom generation moves into the upper echelon ofmanagement. These will include on-site child care, flexible workinghours and sick leave for children's illnesses.   Among the society's other projections:   _City downtowns will become more livable. Many will plant treesand establish cultural and entertainment facilities such as artsdistricts, children's museums and aquariums. Shopping areas willincreasingly be combined with educational, cultural andentertainment facilities.   _Many homes will be protected by laser shields and artificialintelligence security systems, with surveillance by heat-sensitivemonitors and even satellites becoming possible.   _Pocket-sized telephones will become available, somedayreplacing public phones.   _Interactive television will play a large role in the classroomof the future, giving students in remote locations the ability tosee, hear and talk to a professor hundreds of miles away.   _Businesses will need to provide continuous employee training asthe automation and computer revolutions eliminate many low-literacyjobs.   _Computers will become a popular target for terrorists. Attackson high-tech targets, such as computer networks, telecommunicationsfacilities and defense computers could pose a major threat.   _Fraud may become the crime of choice in the future as Americagrows older, replacing burglary which requires the speed andagility of youth.   _New discoveries in biotechnology and genetic engineering couldlead to the replacement of nerve cells, arteries, hormone-producingcells and even brain cells. Artificial implants will become morecommon.   _Coastal structures ranging from cottages to airports built onreclaimed land will face a threat from rising sea levels as thegreenhouse effect melts the polar ice caps.   _Major disease problems of the next century will includeimmune-system disorders, viral conditions, bacteria that havebecome resistant to today's antibiotics, allergies to new chemicalsand mental health problems such as alcoholism, drug dependence andmood disorders.   The society says total deaths from AIDS _ acquired immunedeficiency syndrome _ could top 50 million worldwide in the 1990s,more than the Black Death of the Middle Ages. The World HealthOrganization recently estimated that as many as 10 million peopleworldwide now have AIDS and that another 1 million victims could berecorded by 1993.   But the society says the crisis brought by AIDS could spur aboom in medical research that might avoid a plague while alsobenefiting people suffering from other diseases. Another positiveside effect could be establishment of national health insurancesystems, the futurists say.   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immunesystem, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases andinfections. The virus most often is spread through close contactwith blood, blood products or semen from infected persons.   As of Oct. 10, AIDS had been diagnosed in 75,437 Americans, ofwhom 42,432 had died, according to the federal Centers for DiseaseControl. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.   The society's summary of predictions is being published in theNovember-December issue of its Futurist magazine.</TEXT></DOC>
