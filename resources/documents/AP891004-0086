The IRA statement to Belfast news media claimed the victim was atop member of an unidentified Protestant paramilitary group.   The man was walking along a park in the mixed Protestant-RomanCatholic area when he was shot repeatedly in the head and chest andcollapsed in the street, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said.   He was not immediately identified.   ``He was lying face down on the pavement, which was covered inblood. I could feel a weak pulse, and then it faded away before theambulance arrived,'' said Maeve Boyle, a nurse who rushed to thevictim's aid.   Alban McGuinness, a Belfast city councilman representing theSocial Democratic and Labor Party, the province's main Catholicparty, said:   ``The fact that the shooting appears to have been carried outbefore the horrified gaze of young children going to school speaksvolumes for the sick mentality of the murderers.''   Twenty years of violence have claimed 2,758 lives in NorthernIreland, 47 of them this year.   The chief constable of the Royal Ulster force, meanwhile,dismissed as ``nonsense'' a claim that a secret conspiracy existedinside his force to counter government policies that areobjectionable to the province's Protestant majority.   Hugh Annesley said in a statement Tuesday night that since hetook office in June, all officers of the 13,000-member force ``havegiven me their unqualified loyalty and support.''   He was reacting to a Belfast newspaper report that its deputyeditor talked with a man identifying himself as spokesman for ``theInner Circle,'' an alleged secret society inside the constabulary.   The paper, the Irish News, said the unidentified man displayedsecret lists of Irish Republican Army suspects which could onlyhave come from intelligence agencies.   The paper said the ``Inner Circle'' claimed to be dedicated to``the removal'' of IRA suspects and the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement,which went over the heads of Protestants to give the Irish Republica say in the running of Northern Ireland.   Annesley said that despite his skepticism, he had asked for theclaim to be investigated by English detectives who have been calledin to conduct an independent inquiry into a series of recent leaksof intelligence documents.   The almost exclusively Catholic IRA is fighting to push theBritish out of Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, join it withthe Republic of Ireland and set up an all-Ireland socialist state.</TEXT></DOC>
