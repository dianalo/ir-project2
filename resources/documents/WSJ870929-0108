In anticipation, the Treasury rescheduled five auctions that were delayed during the debt-limit impasse, starting with the sale of $9.25 billion of two-year notes today. The bill, which the president announced over the weekend that he would sign, raises the debt ceiling to $2.8 trillion from $2.11 trillion.    Mr. Reagan is upset over the measure because it may force him to choose between defense cuts he doesn't want and tax increases he has opposed if the government is to reach the legislation's target of $23 billion in deficit reductions for the fiscal year starting Thursday. Thus, the White House is considering staging a public signing ceremony that will give Mr. Reagan another chance to express his disappointment at the measure.    Such a ceremony also would give Mr. Reagan an opportunity to express his determination to try to meet the deficit-reduction target without resorting to tax increases or defense cuts.    Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the White House isn't planning a budget &quot;summit meeting&quot; with congressional leaders to work out a deficit-cutting plan. But he said White House aides plan to work quietly with congressional committees to reach an agreement. Mr. Fitzwater added that the administration is willing to discuss ways to raise government revenues but wouldn't accept tax increases &quot;disguised&quot; as something else.    The Treasury auction rescheduled for today was originally planned for last Tuesday. The notes will be issued tomorrow as originally announced.    Also tomorrow, the Treasury will auction $9.25 billion of 52-week bills, which will be issued Thursday. This sale had been scheduled for today.    On Thursday the department will auction $12.8 billion of 13-week and 26-week Treasury bills that will be dated Oct. 5. These bills were to have been sold Sept. 21.    On Tuesday Oct. 6 the Treasury will sell $7.25 billion of four-year notes that had originally been scheduled for sale last Wednesday. These notes will be issued Oct. 15.    On Wednesday Oct. 7, the department will auction $6.75 billion of seven-year notes that will be issued Oct. 15. This sale had been scheduled for last Thursday.    Tenders for all auctions will be accepted before 1 p.m. EDT at the Federal Reserve bank or branches or at the Treasury on the date of the auction. </TEXT></DOC>
