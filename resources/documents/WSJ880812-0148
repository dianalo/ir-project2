Klein </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> Fredonia, N.Y.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sports are mostly fun, but there are largish chunks of them that many of us can do without. My personal list includes athletic awards named for commercial products (the Rolaids prize for relief pitching especially churns my stomach), the all-night-game World Series, basketball played after tax-deadline day and the entire National Hockey League schedule.    Just about everybody's list includes professional football's training-camp period, now in progress. It is hot. It is miserable. It is onerous even for a sport in which the work-to-play balance weighs heavily on the work side under the best of circumstances.    If you don't believe me on this, hearken to Eric Dickerson, who rakes in yearly seven-figure checks for carrying the ol' pigskin for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League. &quot;I hate training camp,&quot; says Eric. &quot;I've always hated training camp. I'd hate camp even if they held it in Hawaii or Singapore.&quot; Think how unhappy the poor man must be in Anderson, Ind., where the Colts really do train.    Thus, it is nice to present a pre-season football story that has nothing to do with football. It concerns Darby the Dinosaur, the winsome, bespectacled creature pictured herewith (see accompanying illustration-- WSJ Aug. 12, 1988). Darby is the creation of Ray Bentley and Mike Hamby, members of the NFL's Buffalo Bills, who conduct their summer labors on the campus of Fredonia State University here.    Neither Bentley, a linebacker, nor Hamby, a defensive end now at home in Lehi, Utah, recuperating from recent hip surgery, fit the common conceptions of writer (Bentley) or artist (Hamby). Both have biceps as big around as most other men's thighs, and necks better suited to yokes than collars. Bentley further embellishes his ferocious image with a blond mustache the ends of which wend to his jawline.    The stash, he laughs, is &quot;for show,&quot; although he wonders aloud about its effectiveness in light of (or, rather, in the shade of) the helmet, facemask and mouth protector he wears afield. &quot;Maybe it's because I'm basically not a nasty guy, like a linebacker is supposed to be,&quot; he muses. &quot;I think of myself as a writer who plays football.&quot;    The 6-foot-2, 235-pound Bentley grew up in little Hudsonville, Mich. (pop. 4,800), near Grand Rapids. &quot;It was a small school, so everybody could do everything,&quot; he notes. Among the things he did was play varsity football and tennis, and write sports for the school newspaper.    He attempted to duplicate his football player-sportswriter act when he matriculated at Central Michigan University, but says he found the college newspaper's sports page unpalatably dedicated to &quot;mudslinging,&quot; so he limited his published output to occasional, irate letters to the editor. He did, however, major in English, and various professors labored to hone his style.    A three-year stint in the late U.S. Football League, and, now, three seasons with the Bills have not stilled Bentley's literary passion. He bats out a football column and other stories for the Michigan Sports Gazette, a monthly based in Grand Rapids, where he lives, and writes fictional short stories in his spare time.    &quot;I like fiction writing best. Newspaper stuff is too limiting,&quot; he opines. &quot;I use my experiences as a starting point, but I like to play around with them.&quot; He says his best effort to date is an unpublished piece called &quot;Gonzo and the Bear,&quot; about a fellow who wrestles one of the burly beasts (not the Chicago variety). &quot;I never wrestled a bear, but one of my buddies did, at an outdoor show in Grand Rapids,&quot; he confesses. &quot;I wish I had, though, and writing about it is the next best thing.&quot; Safer, too.    Bentley is married and the father of three: Alaina, aged 4; Ritchard, 3; and Thomas, 10 months. Darby the Dinosaur began as the hero of a continuing tale he devised for the older children.    &quot;I'm always making up stories for the kids, and one of them was about a little dinosaur. Pretty soon, that was the only story they wanted to hear,&quot; he says. &quot;My wife, Jodi, got the idea of giving the character a name and putting him in a book. We picked the name Darby from Dean Darby, someone we knew in college. He's a big, pot-bellied, skinny-legged guy, and it kinda fit.    &quot;We did some research, and couldn't find any kids' storybooks with dinosaur characters. That's funny, because kids love dinosaurs. I guess that's because they're big and clumsy and friendly looking, and there aren't any real ones around to scare them.&quot;    Bentley last year confided his idea to teammate Hamby, an even bigger fellow (6-foot-5, 270 pounds) who calls himself &quot;the only jock in the history of Utah State University to major in art.&quot; Together, they forged Darby's persona.    &quot;Isn't he cute?&quot; asks Hamby. &quot;The glasses were my idea. They make him look more like a kid, don't you think?&quot; I do.    The pair has completed one Darby book, a 16-page affair titled &quot;Darby Goes Shopping.&quot; In it, the hero gets dragged to the &quot;Cave Town&quot; mall by his mom, gets lost, gets found, and is rewarded with an ice cream cone. &quot;The story's pretty straightforward, but Mike's pictures make it fun,&quot; Bentley avers.    A sequel, &quot;Darby Takes a Nap,&quot; is on the drawing board, in which the little dino will try numerous ruses to avoid lights out. Hamby is pushing for a third book, wherein Darby will be hassled by a bully. &quot;I'll draw a mean-looking little dinosaur with muscles,&quot; Hamby says. &quot;That's more my usual style, you know. I also do Western paintings with mean-looking cowboys and Indians in them.&quot;    Bentley and Hamby don't have a publisher for their work, or a literary agent, but they are confident that, somehow, both will be acquired eventually. Meantime, the linebacker looks upon his creation as a welcome respite from his summer's toil. &quot;It's nice to have a cheerful thought when you're on the field, sweating and getting beat on,&quot; says he. </TEXT></DOC>
