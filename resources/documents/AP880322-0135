The leftist government's proposal, outlined in a statement tojournalists on the second day of peace talks at this post on theCosta Rican border, calls for a 30-day truce with the rebelsintended for them to lay down their arms and ``rejoin Nicaraguansociety.''   It also provides for the release of a political prisoner foreach rebel accepting amnesty. Deputy Foreign Minister Victory HugoTinoco told reporters there are 3,300 prisoners the governmentconsiders eligible for release under the program.   The Contra proposal calls for a 45-day truce starting on GoodFriday, April 1, in which rebel fighters would move into cesae-firezones still to be determined.   It said the government should grant ``total and unconditionalamnesty'' as soon as the truce takes effect, allowing anyone wholeft Nicaragua for political reasons to ``rejoin the political,economic and social process without any conditions.''   The rebels also want to join a national dialogue between theSandinistas and their internal political opponents while thecease-fire lasts. The government also would allow rebel leaders toparticipate in national reconciliation talks.   ``At the moment in which a cease-fire is signed, whether it befor 30, 60 or 90 days, according to what the counterrevolutionwants, at that moment the leadership of the Nicaraguan Resistancewill be able to rejoin civic and political life and evenparticipate in the national dialogue that seeks a reconciliation ofall Nicaraguans,'' Tinoco said.   Both proposals call for international monitoring of thecease-fire.   The two sides agreed Monday to a cease-fire during the threedays of talks, the first ever held on Nicaraguan territory in morethan 6 years of war and the first direct talks without a mediator.   Rebel and government negotiators for both sides were optimisticafter the first round of peace talks Monday, the first held sinceDecember.   Also Monday, Nicaragua withdrew its soldiers from the Honduranborder. The Honduran military reported Sandinista soldiers hadretreated.   ``The importance of today was that we listened for the firsttime at the highest level their (Contras') proposal, Gen. HumbertoOrtega, Nicaragua's defense minister, said Monday.   Alfredo Cesar, a negotiator for the U.S.-backed rebels, calledthe first round a ``step ahead'' and said the delegations discusseda wide range of issues. ``Neither side seeks a military victoryover the other,'' he said.   At stake in the talks is an end to the bloodshed that hasclaimed an estimated 50,000 dead and wounded and shattered thecountry's economy.   Frank Arana, a rebel spokesman, said the talks went beyond thebounds earlier established by the Sandinistas and includedpolitical issues and ``concepts of democracy.''   ``We spoke about everything,'' he said.   The goal of the Sandinistas is to work out a viable cease-firein accordance with the regional peace plan signed last August bythe presidents of the five Central American nations. They had saidthe talks would cover only the mechanics of how the Contras wouldlay down their arms.   The rebels said the talks should include discussion ofdemocratic reforms, also covered in the regional peace plan.   ``We came here with an open agenda,'' Adolfo Calero, a Contraleader, told reporters. ``And that includes democratizationincluding amnesty. We insisted on speaking about all the problemsfacing Nicaragua.''   President Daniel Ortega on Monday signed a document that dealtwith a number of internal problems. The statement called on allpolitical parties to refrain from violence, a position targeted atthe government supporters who have attacked the opposition.   It also calls for the media to respect the government, areference to the opposition newspaper La Prensa, and theSandinistas promised to release more than a dozen recently jailedlabor leaders and review cases of imprisoned oppositionpoliticiaans.   The Sandinistas' willingness to comply with the peace plan wascited by U.S. congressional members as a reason for rejectingPresident Reagan's calls for additional military and nonlethal aidto the rebels. The peace plan also calls for internal dialogue withthe political opposition.</TEXT></DOC>
