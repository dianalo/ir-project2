(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The parents of former PTL president JimBakker have applied for unemployment benefits after being laid offfrom their jobs as greeters at Heritage USA, PTL's religious themepark.   Raleigh Bakker, 81, and his wife, Furnia, 81, were laid off Jan.29 from their $500-a-month jobs. They still live at the resort.   ``It's pretty hard to take when you've been independent all yourlife and then you have to go down for unemployment,'' RaleighBakker said Friday.   ``We love the Bakkers,'' PTL spokeswoman Linda Ivey said. ``Wehope they will continue to feel a part of the family. But therehave been numerous positions we have had to reduce.''   The work force has fallen from 2,700 to 900 since 1985, she said.   Jim Bakker resigned from PTL in March after admitting a sexualencounter. A federal grand jury in Charlotte is investigating himand his aides for possible mail, wire and tax fraud.   At Heritage USA, Raleigh and Furnia Bakker spent mornings in thePTL studio shaking hands with visitors, and afternoons at theHeritage Grand Hotel.   The elder Bakker gets $600 a month in Social Security and hiswife gets $300 a month. He said his house, valued at $125,500, ispaid for.   ``We haven't been off that long, but we can't live this wayindefinitely,'' he said. He said he must pay taxes, plus homeinsurance and upkeep.   The Bakkers said they must seek jobs at least three times a weekto receive unemployment checks. Bakker plans to apply for PTLopenings _ at the hotel and at restaurants they frequent.</TEXT></DOC>
