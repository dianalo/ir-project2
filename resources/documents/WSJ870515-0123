The Commerce Department estimates there are 18,000 manufacturers -- mostly small -- that could export their products but don't. Of the 30,000 manufacturers that do sell to foreign countries, just 2,000 -- mostly big-account for over two-thirds of these export sales. Clearly, there is room for improvement.    &quot;We cannot reverse our deficit with Boeing 747s and wheat,&quot; says L. Fargo Wells, director of the California Export Finance Office. &quot;We have to do it down in the trenches with small businesses.&quot;    Patriotism aside, there are good reasons for small companies to venture abroad. Two-thirds of the world's market lies beyond U.S. borders, and it's dotted with niches for the resourceful entrepreneur. Overseas sales can absorb excess plant capacity, soften domestic downturns and extend product lives.    They can also spice up an otherwise dull routine. &quot;There's a certain excitement when you're in some areas and see submachine guns where normally here we'd see billy clubs,&quot; confides Philip S. Cohen, president of Michelman Inc., Cincinnati, which ships water-based coatings for cardboard boxes all over the globe. &quot;I'll go anywhere in the world just for the fun of it.&quot;    But it's not all fun and games. Exporting can be a tricky business even for the most sophisticated conglomerate. Fluctuating foreign currencies, Byzantine government regulations, blood-thirsty competitors, cultural chasms and financing problems can give any export manager headaches. If the export manager also happens to be the chief executive officer -- the case in many thinly staffed smaller businesses -- foreign distractions can plunge domestic operations into chaos.    Here are some of the hurdles:   Financing   Some commercial banks do lend to small exporters, mainly through working capital loans that pay for the extra raw materials and workers often needed to fill a foreign order. But finding such a lender is a headache. Many big banks aren't interested in small loans, and small banks, unfamiliar with foreign trade financing, are often wary of the risks.    &quot;If you need $100 million, you're in good shape,&quot; says Ben Hall, whose company makes and exports livestock feeding systems from Oskaloosa, Iowa. &quot;If you need just a little, you have problems.&quot;    Semitek Systems Corp., a tiny Silicon Valley electronics concern, says financing problems torpedoed a $9.5 million contract it won last year to install a solid state relay factory in China. Despite the customer's irrevocable letter of credit from the Bank of China, over a dozen California banks refused Semitek a $3.2 million working capital loan to finance the job. All cited its size (about $1.5 million in revenue at the time). A Japanese company ended up with the project. &quot;In the last two years we've lost over $20 million in foreign contracts&quot; because of credit shortfalls, says Tulio Bo, Semitek's president.    Things may be looking up. Last October, Semitek received a $267,750 loan guarantee from the California Export Finance Office, which was set up in 1985 to help small and medium-sized businesses export. At least 10 states are establishing similar financial aid programs -- including an ambitious effort by Illinois to lend banks money that can then be passed on to exporters.    Prodded by Congress, the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which finances American exports and helps foreign importers obtain credit to buy American products, also is trying to do more -- by pressing additional banks to participate in its export finance programs, for example. And its exporting insurance affiliate, the Federal Credit Insurance Association (FCIA), is exploring a plan to insure against goofs made by inexperienced exporters and provide additional protection for nervous commercial bank lenders.    Ignorance   Many would-be exporters don't have a notion of how to get started -- even though abundant sources of inexpensive information exist. &quot;With about 30 minutes worth of phone calls, a businessman can get many thousands of dollars worth and many man-hours worth of research for free,&quot; says Philip Hinson, a foreign trade expert with the U. S. Chamber of Commerce.    One place to call is the Commerce Department, which offers highly detailed foreign market surveys for a nominal fee. The information isn't perfect, but it's much better than the often outdated material provided a few years ago, says John S. Satagaj, president of the Small Business Legislative Council, a lobbying group. Still, he warns, &quot;The more unsophisticated the firm, the less helpful the Department of Commerce is.&quot;    The department, through its U.S and Foreign Commercial Service, also has foreign trade specialists who provide free, one-on-one counseling in 67 U.S. cities. And it promotes U.S. producers through trade shows and other marketing efforts. Other information sources include local offices of the Small Business Administration, banks, and local freight forwarders.    Export management companies and export trading companies also can help. Be prepared for a complex set of fees that can vary widely with the type of product being exported, as well as the volume. In some cases, there is no fee: The exporter simply buys the product at an agreed-upon price in the U.S. and then takes care of marketing, shipping and distributing, counting on the markup abroad to leave a profit.    But guard against cheap imitations by checking out such companies with banks, accounting firms, international lawyers and local exporting councils. Alfred Lipshultz, president of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Aquathin Corp., decided to export his company's water filters himself after a discouraging look at several export specialists in Miami two years ago.    &quot;The exporters tell you about how many lieutenant generals and director generals they know and how they're related to fifth cousins of heads of state and how that's the only way you're going to get your product in,&quot; he says. &quot;What they've really got for themselves is a cheap vacation that you're footing.&quot;    Cultural Differences   Miami exporter Charles McKay remembers the time he flew 16 drums of liquid plant fertilizer concentrate into Bolivia, expecting a quick profit -- only to find his biggest potential customers, Quechua Indian farmers, refused to use it on religious grounds. Through radio advertisements in local dialect he eventually won them over -- but it still took three years to sell off the expensive inventory. &quot;Costliest mistake we ever made,&quot; he says.    The lesson here is simple: Get to know your market before you commit yourself -- and be prepared to be flexible.    Planning Ahead   Foreign deals often have longer lead times and involve larger-than-normal orders. Poor planning can hopelessly snarl plant operations.    But Jenny Nepsa, owner of The Great American Pie Co., Indianapolis, found that exporting her ceramic pie pans actually smoothed out her cyclical business. &quot;Three years ago I was cooking pottery in my garage,&quot; she says, with just two busy times during the year: Christmas and Mother's Day. But when an English buyer ordered 3,600 pieces last year -- 10% of the year's total business -- she kept seasonal workers on well into July to fill the order in time for Christmas.    Bureaucracy   There's no getting around it: Exporting doubles the number of governments that regulate your product. The paperwork alone can bury small companies. &quot;It's a maze of little things that looks almost insurmountable,&quot; says Ronald C. Liljedahl, executive sales manager of El Bravito Foods Inc., a tortilla distributor in Cheyenne, Wyo., that is gearing up for export to Canada.    Midac Corp., a scientific instrument company in Costa Mesa, Calif., is getting the picture. A mixup on U.S. export licensing forms already has put the company three or four months behind on one of its first two foreign sales, a $180,000 computerized silicon measurement system ordered by a customer in India. And it still doesn't have the license. Now Midac is being warned about big problems with Indian customs if it substitutes even minor components in the equipment, a routine occurrence in such orders. So far, says Midac President Gerald Auth, the two foreign sales &quot;have been more trouble than all the rest of our orders combined.&quot;    For some, the hassle is apparently worth it. El Bravito Foods, for instance, &quot;won't stop until we accomplish foreign trade,&quot; declares Mr. Liljedahl. &quot;Even if it's just getting a crate of potato chips across the border.&quot;    ---   Mr. Allen is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Miami bureau.    ---                        Selling Abroad   The 15 U.S. industries with the highest export potential(including products and services), ranked in descendingorder:    1.
