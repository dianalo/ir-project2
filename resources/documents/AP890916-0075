Police said the haul was one of the world's largest seizures ofpoached ivory.   Police spokesman Kierie du Rand said the ivory would sell forabout $1.5 million. Police discovered it when they stopped a truckat Okahandja, 45 miles north of Windhoek, he said.   The tusks are believed to have come from elephants in southernAngola and northern Namibia.   Africa's elephant population has fallen from about 1.5 million in1978 to as few as 400,000, due mostly to poachers who seek thevaluable tusks.   Several Western nations, including the United States, recentlyhave banned the import of ivory, and the 102-nation Convention ofInternational Trade in Endangered Species will consider a worldwideban on the ivory trade next month.   Angola's 14-year-old civil war has made it virtually impossibleto stop poaching in the southern part of the country.   Namibia allows a limited legal trade in ivory.   South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe hold similar positions,saying properly managed ivory sales allow them to keep the elephantpopulation under control and generate revenue for conservationprograms.</TEXT></DOC>
