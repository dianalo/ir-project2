Texaco, however, insisted that taking the case to a federal court was its only way to preserve its right to due process, which it said it otherwise would have lost in bankruptcy before it could exhaust its appeal.    In an hour of oral arguments before the high court -- the first courtroom proceedings in the case since last summer -- Pennzoil and Texaco renewed the fight over a side issue that looms almost as large as the record judgment itself. That issue is an injunction by a federal judge in White Plains, N.Y. -- where Texaco is based -- that prevents Pennzoil from imposing liens on Texaco property and from demanding a $12 billion bond while Texaco appeals the $11.1 billion award that a Texas state court gave Pennzoil in December 1985.    The Texas jury found that Texaco improperly interfered with a merger agreement between Pennzoil and Getty Oil Co., which later was acquired by Texaco. The case remains on appeal in a Texas appeals court, where a decision is expected soon.    Though the issue before the Supreme Court has no bearing on the underlying state court matter, the high court's decision would be certain to weigh heavily in any negotiations for a settlement. Though Pennzoil yesterday reiterated its assurances that it doesn't seek the full $12 billion bond that Texas court rules say it can demand, removal of the federal court injunction would certainly put pressure on Texaco to settle. Texaco also has maintained that even by filing liens on Texaco assets, Pennzoil could trigger defaults on Texaco lending agreements that would thrust Texaco into bankruptcy-law proceedings.    During the proceedings yesterday, Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University law professor representing Pennzoil, accused Texaco of creating a &quot;Fortune 500 exception to federalism&quot; and of demanding &quot;Dow Jones due process&quot; by striking fear in the courts that the Texas rules would prompt history's largest bankruptcy-law filing.    &quot;If you're rich enough and big enough to project your fears into the stock-exchange tape,&quot; Mr. Tribe said, &quot;then you get a better deal.&quot;    Mr. Tribe argued that the federal injunction against the Texas bond-and-lien rules &quot;gets the case through the back door and completely disorients the structure of federalism.&quot; Since adopting the Anti-Injunction Act in 1793, he contended, Congress has recognized the sovereignty of state courts. Small businesses don't obtain federal relief from liens and solvency-threatening court bonds, Mr. Tribe said, but in this case, &quot;We find principles of federalism and due process bent and twisted to get a better deal for a larger corporation.&quot;    Texaco had successfully argued for an exception to the Anti-Injunction Act by citing the Civil Rights Act, under which federal courts have entered state-court jurisdiction to preserve individual liberties. The issue opened Texaco's lead lawyer -- David Boies of Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore, New York -- to heated questioning by Justice Thurgood Marshall, the court's only black justice.    &quot;Do you really think (the Civil Rights Act) was passed to protect multibillion-dollar corporations?&quot; Justice Marshall asked. &quot;There's no statute that says the fat cat wins and the small guy loses.&quot;    &quot;Your honor,&quot; Mr. Boies replied, &quot;I think (it) was passed to protect the rights of everyone. . . . When we begin to divide federal rights . . . we endanger these rights for everyone.&quot;    Justice Marshall also demanded an explanation for Texaco's choice of federal court in its home town for litigating the Texas rules.    &quot;Could this case have been filed in Anchorage?&quot; he asked.    &quot;I don't think so, your honor,&quot; Mr. Boies answered.    &quot;What's the difference? You admit you're (forum) shopping? . . . .They do have federal courts in Texas,&quot; the justice declared.    Mr. Boies said that besides being company headquarters, White Plains is where Texaco intended to seek Chapter 11 protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code if Houston-based Pennzoil had filed liens against the company's assets. White Plains, he said, &quot;made sense.&quot;    Pennzoil's Mr. Tribe found the court to be anything but a pushover, however. He said Texaco failed to &quot;exhaust its remedies&quot; in Texas before leaping into the federal courts. But, said Justice Sandra O'Connor, &quot;It isn't at all clear to me what might have been available in Texas,&quot; had Texaco sought relief there.    J. Hugh Liedtke, the chairman of Pennzoil, said after the hearing, &quot;I score it like my children used to score on their report cards: 100%, A-plus.&quot;    James Kinnear, Texaco's chief executive officer, said he felt more confident than ever -- and as suspicious as ever about Pennzoil's motives. &quot;Why,&quot; he asked, &quot;is Pennzoil so desperate to deny us our right to appeal?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
