But a spate of scandals has thrust Scandinavia's arms industry into the international spotlight and forced soul-searching in socialist countries that had always taken pride in their image as peacemakers.    The first scandal broke in March, when Nobel Industries Sweden AB confirmed rumors that two of its units, AB Bofors and Nobel Kemi AB, had smuggled weapons to embargoed countries in the Middle East. Not long after, disclosures that Kongsberg and Toshiba Machine Co. of Japan, a Toshiba Corp. unit, had sold sensitive equipment to the Soviet Union created a furor in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Last month, an angry U.S. Senate approved sanctions that Kongsberg said it mightn't be able to survive. Norwegian authorities also are reviewing more than 100 equipment sales Kongsberg made to the Soviet Union between 1975 and 1984. Many of the sales involved other West European companies.    In the latest developments, Swedish prosecutor Folke Ljungvall this month said he is investigating a reported 1985 ammunition sale by Bofors to Oman, as well as the possible sale of advanced anti-aircraft guns to third countries through a Bofors associate company in Singapore. Like a number of other transactions in which Bofors allegedly has participated in this decade, the sales would violate a Swedish law prohibiting that country's arms makers from selling weapons to countries at war or likely to go to war.    Also this month, Swedish authorities appointed a prosecutor to investigate allegations that Bofors bribed a Singaporean to win contracts in Singapore. And a few days ago, Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi expelled former Defense Minister Vishwanath Prathap Singh from the ruling Congress (I) Party, in part because of his criticism of fees Bofors allegedly paid New Delhi officials to win a $1.3 billion contract from India.    Both Nordic countries were trapped by a paradox. To maintain military self-sufficiency they had to support their defense industries. But to achieve economies of scale, the weapons makers had to sell abroad.    Norwegian Defense Minister Johan Joergen Holst calls this contradiction &quot;the predicament of small powers.&quot; Anders Carlberg, Nobel's president, dubs it the &quot;Swedish dilemma.&quot;    Where Kongsberg stumbled, company and government officials say, was in attempting to diversify. Since 1814, when it was founded by royal decree as a state armory, Kongsberg had relied on state support to remain solvent. Even after it was constituted in 1968 as a limited-liability, government-owned company, it still got subsidies. From 1968 through 1986, government handouts to the company totaled 879 million Norwegian kroner ($130 million).    During the 1970s, the company sought to bolster its position by moving into a range of businesses. Some, such as an operation to make auto parts, were moderately successful. Others, including a data-products and a jet-engine division, bled red ink. Even before reports of the sale to the Soviet Union surfaced, the company had begun a financial restructuring to cope with its 2.7 billion-kroner ($398 million) debt burden.    Olov Fjell, Kongsberg's executive vice president for finance, says the sale resulted from &quot;too much autonomy&quot; at the data-products division and from &quot;taking financial and strategic risks that were out of proportion to our capabilities.&quot;    At Nobel, Mr. Carlberg, the president, and other company officials haven't defended the illegal sales. But they have challenged the government's tough policies on exports, saying that Swedish government orders alone aren't sufficient to support large arms companies. Some Nobel officials allege that Swedish government officials understand this and tacitly approved of arms reexports.    The 1988 defense budget for neutral Sweden is 26.38 billion Swedish kronor ($4.07 billion). Only a fraction of that amount is used to purchase equipment, and the amount directed to Sweden's about 50 defense-related companies makes up only a bare majority of total equipment purchases. As a result, the country's big defense companies export heavily, shipping about 3.24 billion kronor of products last year, according to the Department of Foreign Trade.    In Norway, the government plans to spend 18.21 billion kroner on defense goods and services in 1987. Much of that will be poured into projects related to its NATO commitments. Last year, about 50% of Kongsberg's defense sales of 660 million kroner came from government orders, while the rest was from foreign orders. Norway doesn't keep statistics on total defense exports, but a trade official said most come from Kongsberg. The 50 companies in Norway that sell defense-related products are allowed to export such goods only to NATO or neutral countries.    That restriction, like Sweden's ban on sales to countries in or near conflict, can present a predicament for Swedish and Norwegian arms makers. They have built reputations for designing and building high-quality, high-technology equipment for which there is strong demand.    Some U.S. allies who aren't NATO members recently approached Kongsberg to buy its top-caliber Penguin anti-ship missiles but were turned away. Officials at Kongsberg and in Norway's Ministry of Defense apparently decided it would be difficult to get export approval for the products after the sale to the Soviets.    &quot;It's a whole series of tough decisions for arms makers here,&quot; says a diplomat in Stockholm. &quot;They always have to decide how to play by the rules, and whether they will stick to them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
