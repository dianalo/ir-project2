MILLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sgt. John Maggard and his wife, Kim,have won a long, bureaucratic battle to get their adopted son withAIDS into the United States. Now they face a sterner test: keepinghim alive.   Jared Maggard ``has three weeks, three months, three years; wedon't know,'' says his mother. His father says: ``Without a cure,we know Jared will die. Our goal is to give him as much time aspossible.''   The miracle the Maggards hope for is a cure for acquired immunedeficiency syndrome, which Jared had when he was born to a youngPanamanian woman and an unknown father.   The AIDS virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victimssusceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is mostoften transmitted through sexual contact, transfusions of taintedblood and the sharing of contaminated needles by drug abusers. AIDScan also be passed from mother to child at or before birth.   When the Maggards found Jared, abandoned in a hospital in Colon,Panama, they didn't know he had AIDS. He was 11 months old, weighed3{ pounds and was being treated for malnutrition. Pictures showskeletal arms and legs, ribs visible beneath thin, stretched skin,eyes sunken in an almost fleshless skull.   Kim, 25, had recently suffered a miscarriage, and she and herhusband, a 26-year-old Army policeman then stationed at Fort Gulickon the Pacific end of the Panama Canal, fell in love with the child.   The couple, from Ypsilanti, Mich., consulted Army attorneys,hired a Panamanian lawyer and began adoption proceedings. They werequickly granted custody. The adoption became final last Wednesday.   When the Maggards took Jared home from the hospital in December1986, he also was suffering from an ear infection. His new motherpumped food into him _ sugar water, infant formula laced withcereal, canned baby food by the carton.   Jared gained weight, but despite repeated visits to Armyclinics, the ear infection persisted. Finally, 11 months later,doctors, puzzled by their inability to cure the infection withstandard antibiotics, ran a series of tests. They showed Jared hadAIDS.   ``There's no doubt he had it from birth,'' Mrs. Maggard said ina recent interview. ``And children born with AIDS don't usuallylive beyond the age of 2. The prognosis is between 2 and 6 years atthe most, and there have been only a few cases in which an infectedchild has reached the age of 6.''   The AIDS-positive test results came back on Sept. 15, 1987, amonth before Sgt. Maggard was to begin a new assignment in theUnited States. U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Serviceofficials, the U.S. consul general in Panama and army lawyers toldthe couple they could not take Jared home with them.   ``We were told it was against the law for anyone with AIDS toenter the United States, and, besides, the adoption was notcomplete at the time,'' says Mrs. Maggard. ``We were told we shouldgive Jared back and forget about it. I wasn't about to do that.''   Sgt. Maggard extended his tour of duty in Panama for anotheryear rather than leave without his son. But repeated entreaties bythe young couple failed to sway a government and militarybureaucracy.   On July 4, Willard Scott, the NBC Television weatherman, came toPanama to preside over an Independence Day celebration for U.S.servicemen and women and their families. By chance, he met Mrs.Maggard, who told him of the couple's plight. NBC aired the storybriefly on its nightly news program in early August.   ``The next day, the telephone began ringing off the hook,'' saysMrs. Maggard. From those calls, the Maggards say, they learned forthe first time of a provision in immigration rules that allow someAIDS victims into the United States on a parole basis.   ``We had never heard of that before,'' says Mrs. Maggard.``Nobody down here had ever told us of that. But the Army wasclearly embarrassed, and it suddenly got behind us 100 percent.''   Sgt. Maggard says his commanding officer has told him that hecan transfer to any one of four military posts in the United Stateswhere the Army has AIDS treatment centers.   He says he will choose within the next week or so whether to goto the Washington, D.C., area, to be near the Walter Reed MedicalCenter, or to Fort Sam Houston, Tex., where the Army hospital has award devoted to AIDS patients.   ``In the United States, Jared can be treated with AZT, andthat's not available to Army doctors overseas,'' says Mrs. Maggard.AZT is a new drug recently approved for AIDS treatment by the U.S.Food and Drug Administration. It is not a cure, but has been foundto prolong the life of some victims by strengthening their immunesystems.   As the Maggards spoke, Jared, now a chubby, outwardly healthyappearing youngster of almost 3 years, played underfoot, jabberingin childish English and his native Spanish, part of a culture hisparents say they are bent on preserving for him.   ``Everybody remarks about how healthy he looks,'' said Mrs.Maggard. ``But he has a lung infection that won't clear up, anddoctors say there are seven stages in the progression of AIDS.Given the diseases Jared already has had, they figure he is in thefifth or sixth stage.''</TEXT></DOC>
