Now Mr. Quayle finds himself on the receiving end asWhitten loyalists restrict disbursements for repairs on thevice president's official residence.</LP><TEXT>   At issue is the Bush administration's request for extendedauthority to spend $330,000 as part of a larger project torepair and renovate the home. Though the funds wereappropriated for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, theadministration is fearful of delays in the contract processand wants to be able to use all the money, even if it takeslonger.   But the House committee balked, in what both sides sayamounted to a message to Mr. Quayle to lay off its elderlychairman. &quot;This project should be completed expeditiously,&quot;wrote the panel with apparent mock concern. &quot;Theinconvenience to the family caused by the drawn outrehabilitation period is not desirable or acceptable.&quot;   Mr. Whitten, who will be 81 years old next month, waselected to Congress in 1941, and the Mississippi Democrat isnow the dean of the House. Mr. Quayle, whose own youth hassometimes gotten him into trouble, would taunt Mr. Whitten,according to Associated Press reports: &quot;He had seven years ofseniority when I was born,&quot; the vice president said. Theissue is expected to be resolved before Congress completesaction on the pending supplemental spending bill, and thechairman and vice president chatted amicably on the way tolast month's funeral for Rep. Silvio Conte, who was 69 andthe ranking Republican on the committee.   The White House is helped, too, by its close alliance withMr. Whitten's counterpart, Senate Appropriations CommitteeChairman Robert Byrd, who has a few building projects of hisown.   A year ago, with the tacit help of the administration, Mr.Byrd secured $185 million for a Federal Bureau ofInvestigation finger print facility finally located in hishome state of West Virginia. With less notice, Mr. Byrdinserted funding into the Central Intelligence Agency'sclassified budget last fall in connection with a secondoffice project.   The money was added as part of the fiscal 1991 Pentagonappropriations bill, but despite repeated inquiries, thesenator's office has denied any knowledge of funding relatedto a future CIA building in West Virginia. Yesterday, Mr.Byrd's staff released an announcement that the CIA isexploring various sites in the Washington area, includingJefferson County, W.Va., for a new office compound of 350 to500 acres. Funding to permit this search was in fact providedat the request of Mr. Byrd, the statement said, and a siteselection is expected in June or July.</TEXT></DOC>
