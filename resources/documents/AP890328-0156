But Paul Alper, assistant corporation counsel for the districtgovernment, told Judge Stephen F. Eilperin he has no choice but toenforce an interstate agreement requiring states to extraditejuveniles charged with crimes by other states.   Failing to honor that agreement, Alper argued, would quicklyturn the nation's capital into ``a haven for fleeing fugitives.''   Eilperin said he would rule Thursday morning on Alabama'spetition to extradite the youth, identified only by the initialsO.M. He also said he would issue an immediate stay of that rulingto give the losing side a change to appeal to the District ofColumbia Court of Appeals.   O.M. is charged in the May 1988 firebombing of an apartment inGadsden, Ala., which resulted in the death of 14-month-old TamelJackson. Yul Devoe Guice, 31, an uncle of O.M., was arrested soonafter the bombing and charged with murder and arson.   O.M. was arrested by district authorities in December and hasbeen fighting extradition ever since. His grandmother, Alice GuiceThomas, testified at a hearing last month that O.M., who is black,cannot get a fair trial from the white authorities of EtowahCounty, Ala.   Alper argued Tuesday, however, that the fairness of the Alabamajudicial system is not at issue in the case.   ``We would be annoyed at the very least if the courts in Alabamaattempted to pass judgement on our system of justice,'' Alper said,arguing that O.M.'s lawyers would have Eilperin pass judgement onthe quality of Alabama justice.   Gerald Fisher, O.M.'s lead attorney, focused on the deathpenalty issue, contending that the district's City Council, inbanning the death penalty, incorporated that ban into theinterstate agreement governing juvenile extraditions.   But Eilperin seemed reluctant to acceept that argument. He toldthe boy's lawyers several times that the ``major problem'' withtheir reasoning was that O.M. is not facing the death penalty aslong he is tried as a juvenile.   ``If Alabama decides to try him as an adult, this court isconstitutionally obligated to send him back to Alabama for trial,''Eilperin said.   Fisher argued, however, that Alabama authorities cannot certifyO.M. for trial as an adult _ and subject him to a possible deathsentence _ without him first being returned to the state.   An extradition order, he said, thus would violate the district'sban on capital punishment because it would clear the way forAlabama authorities to try O.M. as an adult, should they so chose.</TEXT></DOC>
