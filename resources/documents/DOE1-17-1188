A field investigation was made to obtain vibrations and pulsationsover the entire range of plant operating conditions. The data showedthat cavitation was present at nearly all operating conditions due tothe high pulsations in the suction system. The discharge system experiencedhigh vibrations and piping failures due to the ineffectiveness of theaccumulator. An acoustical analysis of the suction and discharge systemwas made to design the optimum acoustical filter systems to alleviatethe problems. The acoustical analyses were performed with a digital computerprogram which predicts the acoustical resonant frequencies and the pulsationamplitudes over the speed range. This paper discusses the investigationsand gives recommendations for prevention of these types of problems inthe future. 5 refs., 14 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
