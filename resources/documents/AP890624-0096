(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Florida's second annual alligatorhunt has drawn more than 20,000 applicants, or about three timeswhat last year's hunt drew.   ``We were a little bit surprised. I estimated we would getdouble, but not triple,'' last year's applications said DennisDavid, alligator program coordinator for the Florida Game and FreshWater Fish Commission.   David said 20,361 people applied before the June 15 deadline,leaving about 80 hopefuls for every permit to be granted.   The commission brought back gator hunting, in limited numbers,after a 25-year ban when alligators were counted as an endangeredspecies. They now number over a million and have become a nuisancein some areas.   About 250 to 300 trappers will be randomly selected by acomputerized lottery for the 30-day hunt in September.   Last year, a computer sorted through 5,800 applications to selectthe 238 trappers that were given hunt permits.   Hunters are allowed 15 gators each. Florida residents selected inthe lottery must pay a hunt license fee of $250. The fee forout-of-state residents is $1,000.   Last year's trappers bagged 2,988 alligators, 582 alligatorsshort of the hunt's allotted amount.   The game commission made one significant rule change for thesecond hunt after receiving complaints of brutality towardalligators: Trappers are now required to kill their captured quarryimmediately, instead of binding live alligators until they aredelivered to a meat processor.</TEXT></DOC>
