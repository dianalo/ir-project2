Some existingmarker methods have been presenting serious problems such as physico-chemicalalterations of feedstuff during the treatment and also marker migrationin rumen conditions. In this study, the rare-earth element Scandium-46has been applied to marking sugarcane bagasse physically processed. Thedata showed no significant migration of marker to liquid phase. The retentiontime in the rumen fistulated cow was 23.06 hours. Correlation coefficientof elapsed time after marking with logarithm of specific activity ofruminal content was 0.9986**.</TEXT></DOC>
