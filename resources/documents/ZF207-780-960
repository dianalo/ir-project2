 The significance ofT1 lines for Network Equipment is that following deregulation customers havebeen able to lease these lines which are designed to carry voice and datatraffic via a high-speed 1.544Mbps digital signal.andP;  This means that customerscan combine many application-specific networks into one backbone network,which can serve as a utility to provide bandwidth for all specificapplications thereby enabling them to build and manage private wide areanetworks.andM;T3 linesandM;Consequently, Network Equipment seized the opportunity to introduce itsflagship product, the Integrated Digital Network Exchange, into the market in1984.andP;  The Network is part of a genre of communications products known asTransmission Resource Managers, which are used by large corporates toincrease the availability of high priority applications, to manage theprivate network and its bandwidth, and to accommodate data processing andtransmission services offered by large carriers.andP;  Network Equipment'soriginal products were developed for high-end networking capabilities andinclude the IDNX/70 for high capacity implementation in headquarters sites orlarge data processing centres, the IDNX/40 for lower volume locations such asregional centres, and the IDNX/20 for smaller sites.andP;  In April this range wasexpanded as the IDNX/90 was added to the top, serving as a platform fornon-subrated T3 services (these lines carry digital voice and data signals atthe speed of 44.7Mbps), while the IDNX/10 was added to the bottom of therange to provide cost-effective connectivity to backbone networks for lowtraffic volume sites.andP;  Along with these products the company offers softwareto manage networks such as the Series 5000 Network Management System and theModel 3040/3050 Enhanced Operator Console.andP;  Network Equipment has also beenbusy adding products to suit the mid-range and low-end segments of the datacommunications market.andP;  To this end it acquired ComDesign in 1986: thecompany manufactures products that operate at &quot;sub-T1&quot; speeds of 64Kbps andbelow.andP;  Now called the Access Products Division, this subsidiary integratesdata applications into IDNX networks, so that Network Equipment's privatenetworks extend down to the desktop through products such as the SPX NetworkProcessor and the PacketPlus/50 X25 switch.andP;  Not all of the company'sacquisitive intentions have proved so successful: its bid for Excelan Inc inthe spring of 1988, for example, was called off after Network Equipmentclaimed that Excelan was in breach of the merger agreement (CI No 930).andM;By Katy RingandM;A subsequent deal with Cisco Systems this February has enabled NetworkEquipment to license software to sell to customers as an integrated bridgeand router to attach local area networks to wide area networks.andP;  (Thismerging of local and wide area networks was something the Excelan acquisitionwas meant to provide).andP;  Network Equipment claims to have the largest marketshare of the US T1 multiplexing business and is targeting the 1,000 largestusers of communications equipment, of which it now serves 200.andP;  Its annualfigures to March 31 revealed that Network Equipment had made a net profit of$16m on turnover that was just under $137m.andP;  In fact 25% of the company'sturnover comes from IBM following a distribution and product developmentagreement made in June 1987 (CI No 701).andP;  Under this agreement IBM sellsNetwork Equipment products on a non-exclusive basis world-wide to largemainframe customers and has licensed Network Equipment's protocols so that itcan emulate them (CI No 854).andP;  In return Network Equipment receives researchand development funding from IBM and has the right to take IBM technology andincorporate it into devices.andP;  Aside from counting companies such as IBM, DEC,Unisys, and Texas Instruments among its customers, major banks, largeretailers, firms in the securities industry and government agencies all useNetwork Equipment products.andP;  Having established a high profile in the US,Network Equipment set up a European base, Network Equipment Technology Ltd,18 months ago in Crawley, Sussex.andP;  It now feels that with about 35 staff ithas built this European operation up to a size which warrants bringing in astrong vice president to give it that extra pzazz.andP;  The man in question isJohn Eddon, who used to be vice-president of worldwide marketing for theUnisys subsidiary, Timeplex Inc, and who has also been marketing manager,data processing, IBM Europe.andP;  The fact that Network Equipment has been soquiet in Europe so far was according to Charles Keating, the company'sinternational vice president, because it was making sure its systems arecompliant with European standards before shouting about its products.andM;10% in EuropeandM;At the moment 10% of the company's revenue comes from Europe, but it wantsthat to rise to around 30%.It already has 35 networks operating in Europe,around half of which are extensions to US networks for companies such asAmerican Express and DuPont.andP;  More encouraging, however, is the fact that theother half are completely new European contracts with organisations such asCredit Suisse.andP;  Ultimately Network Equipment wants to network companiesoperating in the US, Europe and the Far East.andP;  It has equipment installed andworking in all major European countries and will open support centres in Osloand Paris this year, with centres opening in Italy and Germany next year.andO;The reason Europe is so attractive to companies like Network Equipment isbecause of the European-wide amalgamations of businesses, and thederegulation of the European telecommunication networks.andP;  If this follows thesame pattern as in the US then transmission bandwidth will become inexpensiveand a potentially enormous number of users will add applications such asvideoconferencing onto their networks, all of which is good news for NetworkEquipment.andP;  Indeed, Keating believes that one market sector in particularthat stands to expand when this happens is manufacturing and design.andP;  He seesthis sector following the pattern of the financial services in the networkingof information and points to the example of big multinationals such as IBM,Ford and Peugeot as companies that are already implementing 24-hour a daydesign programmes to shorten product lead times.andP;  All in all the future islooking rosy for Network Equipment which is now listed on the New York StockExchange (CI No 1,179) and expects $200m turnover for the year to March 311990.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
