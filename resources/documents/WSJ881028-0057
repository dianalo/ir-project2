They're already over the castle walls of companies once thought secure, such as Kraft Inc. and RJR Nabisco Inc. Executives at other companies are inspecting their defenses, wondering who, if anyone, is safe.    But there are corporate fortresses where managers can likely repel even the most determined assault.    These companies don't just have devices such as poison pills or staggered boards that merely discourage raiders. Instead, they have barriers and defenses that make them highly takeover-resistant or even takeover-proof. Their managers remain secure in the knowledge that hungry acquirers can't easily oust them.    For example, Ford Motor Co., occasionally the subject of loose takeover speculation despite its huge market value of $26 billion, has a supervoting stock giving descendants of Henry Ford 40% voting control. &quot;It certainly would be a problem for any takeover person,&quot; says Ford spokesman Tom Foote. &quot;If they held firm, it would be pretty hard to overcome.&quot;    Here, based on interviews with investment bankers and takeover speculators, are barriers that really keep out marauders, in descending order of security:   PRIVATE COMPANIES: They have, of course, the best defense. A closely held company whose stock isn't publicly traded can't be scooped up by a tender offer to public stockholders. Examples range from commodity giants such as J. R. Simplot Co. to the real-estate empire of Canada-based Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd.    BLOCKING STAKES: Companies with 50% or more of their stock in the hands of one owner or a tight-knit group can be all but invulnerable. Among food companies alone, a foundation-owned trust has 70% voting control of Hershey Foods Corp., the Dorrance family owns 59% of Campbell Soup Co., and a foundation controls 35% of Kellogg Co.    Some investment bankers maintain that trustees have a &quot;fiduciary obligation&quot; to consider big bids. However, some trustees indicate their obligations may include protecting the company itself.    At Hershey, for example, trustees representing the Milton Hershey School, an orphanage in Hershey, Pa., have said preserving the environment of the school, including company headquarters and plants, is &quot;extremely important.&quot;    Some managers who lack blocking stakes may try to manufacture their own. Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., sometimes a rumored target, recently announced plans to replace its pension plan in December with an employee stock ownership plan. The ESOP will gradually boost the stake of present and former Merrill employees and their families from 19% to 25%.    Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea Co. launched a bid for Delchamps Inc. in October 1986, although an ESOP then owned 15%. Delchamps, a Gulf Coast grocery chain, got employees and friendly shareholders with 35% to sign a no-sell pledge that blocked the transaction. Although Aandamp;P has made two more attempts, it hasn't yet succeeded, and by now the ESOP has boosted its stake to 25%.    SUPERVOTING STOCK: Many media companies, including Washington Post Co., New York Times Co., and Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of this newspaper, have a class of supervoting stock like Ford's that keeps control among descendants of the founder or builder of the business.    While new Securities and Exchange Commission rules makes it more difficult for companies to create new supervoting stock, companies with existing setups can keep them. At least one would-be acquirer, Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman, has tried to unlock a supervoting stock at Media General Corp. So far, he's stalled.    But it's another story when supervoting stock owners are divided. Class B holders have 74% voting control of R.P. Scherer Co., a maker of gelatin capsules. But in a family feud, Karla Scherer Fink, the largest holder, got the board to put the company up for sale or restructuring after she led a bitter proxy fight this summer.    SIZE: Executives at International Business Machines Corp. and Exxon Corp. have little to fear from a hostile takeover. Size is &quot;still an inhibiting factor,&quot; says takeover lawyer Arthur Fleischer of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver andamp; Jacobson. &quot;But you can't say anymore that it's a complete block.&quot;    Opinions differ on General Motors Corp. Although the market value of its common stock alone is $25 billion, its Class E and H stocks, with interests in its Electronic Data Systems and GM Hughes Electronics units, add another $6 billion. Put a takeover premium on that and you're talking $40 billion -- another order of magnitude from even the current megadeals.    One big variable is whether company management wants to do a leveraged buyout. RJR Nabisco, which set the current standard by drawing a $20 billion bid, would probably still be considered too big if its president F. Ross Johnson hadn't decided to lead a $17 billion bid for the company. Once he put RJR in play, another bidder, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., topped his offer. -   POLITICS: Many experts believe this would be the biggest barrier to a takeover, or even a friendly leveraged buy-out, of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., General Electric Co. or General Motors. Despite GM's management woes, U.S. officials probably would stand up and say, &quot;Hold on. How can we allow a national resource like GM to be exposed to the risk of a leveraged buy-out?&quot; Unions and suppliers would likely join the chorus.    The proposed acquisition by Fujitsu Ltd. of the Fairchild Semiconductor unit of Schlumberger Ltd. was scuttled last year because of a political outcry over Japanese ownership of a high-tech company important to U.S. security interests.    REGULATION: Many defense contractors, banks and insurance companies are protected by their close dealings with government regulators who can impede takeover efforts. &quot;It doesn't mean it's impossible, but clearly it's an additional barrier,&quot; says Raymond Minella, head of high-yield bonds at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.    However, regulators needn't forestall a determined and patient bidder. Bank of New York Co. showed this in prevailing after a year-long struggle to acquire Irving Bank Corp.    A few years ago, some people thought federal broadcast license transfer rules might slow TV network takeovers, yet all three networks have undergone major ownership changes since then.    B.A.T Industries PLC, a British concern, also prevailed in its bid to take over Farmers Group Inc., a Pennsylvania insurer. Farmers finally agreed to a $5.5 billion deal after an eight-month siege in which B.A.T overcame objections from several state insurance regulators.    A STRONG STOCK PRICE: One of the best defenses is a high stock price (that is, a high price-earnings ratio), which implies shareholders already believe in a company's management and growth prospects. Many takeover targets sold at a below-average P-E ratio, and a high multiple makes a takeover much more expensive. But it's no barrier to a determined bidder who wants the company at all costs.    THE INDISPENSABLE INDIVIDUAL: Some cynical takeover speculators laughed out loud when asked if a key executive who might resign from a target corporation could hinder a takeover. However, some individuals are crucial to their companies' prospects and market values.    Take Microsoft Corp. chairman William Gates. A vital figure in the personal computer business, Mr. Gates co-founded Microsoft and remains its animating force. Microsoft would be worth only a fraction of its market value without him, analysts say. Yet such debates may be academic because he also owns a 38% stake; other Microsoft executives own 7.8%.    ---            Barriers Facing the Hostile Bidder    These are among the biggest roadblocks to unwanted takeovers    Blocking Stakes              Supervoting Stock    -- Campbell Soup             -- Ford Motor    -- Hershey Foods             -- Media General    Still Too Big                Political Fallout    -- IBM                       -- ATandamp;T    -- Exxon                     -- General Electric</TEXT></DOC>
