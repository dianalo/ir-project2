The Definitions,Regulations, and Standards are established pursuant to the authority inthe Animal Welfare Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2131, <T3>et seq.</T3>) (the Act). This law requires the Secretary to promulgateregulations and standards governing the humane handling, housing, care,treatment, and transportation of certain animals by dealers, research facilities,exhibitors, operators of auction sales, carriers, and intermediate handlers.The standards and regulations must include minimum requirements with respectto handling, housing, feeding, sanitation, veterinary care, and other mattersspecified in section 13 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2143). Upon publication ofa final rule, these definitions will provide specific meanings for themost important terms used in the regulations and standards.In a document published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 31, 1987 (52 FR 10292-10298), we proposedto amend the Animal Welfare regulations, 9 CFR Parts 1 and 2, ``Definitionof Terms'' and ``Regulations,'' to comply with the 1985 amendments to theAnimal Welfare Act, and to expand, clarify, and revise the current regulations.Comments were solicited concerning both proposals for a 60-day period endingJune 1, 1987. This period was twice extended and ended on August 27, 1987.We received a total of 7,857 comments: 1,438 were from the research community;987 were from dealers and exhibitors; and 5,432 were from members of thepublic, including humane organizations and animal welfare societies. Allof the comments that were timely received were considered. Those raisingobjections or suggesting changes to the proposed definitions are discussedbelow. Comments received after the close of the comment period have notbeen considered.In response to the numerous comments received, we determined that certainchanges to our proposal are necessary. These changes, discussed below,have been incorporated in this revised rule. In addition, many of the commentswe received in response to our March 31, 1987 proposal to amend Part 2suggested that certain additional terms should be defined. We have alsodetermined that certain terms appearing in the proposed rule to amend Part3 require definition so that the public can understand them. We are thereforeadding several definitions, as discussed below, to make the regulationsin Parts 2 and 3 easier to understand, thereby increasing compliance andmaking them more effective.Each definition addressed below has been given its own heading to assistthe reader in locating a particular term. Comments concerning the proposeddefinitions as a whole are discussed first under the heading, ``General.''Supplemental Request for Comments on Interrelationship of Parts 1, 2, and3 of the Animal Welfare RegulationsWe received 334 comments (309 from members of the research community and25 from members of the general public) suggesting that we revise the proposedrules for Parts 1 and 2, ``Definition of Terms'' and ``Regulations,'' andpublish a second proposal in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for public comment. We also received 445 comments(400 from members of the research community and 45 from members of thegeneral public) suggesting that we revise the proposals for Parts 1 and2 and publish them along with our proposal for standards for the exerciseof dogs and for a physical environment to promote the psychological well-beingof nonhuman primates. These specific standards are mandated by the 1985amendments to the Act.We have determined to respond to the comments we received addressing theproposed rules, and to publish revised rules for Parts 1 and 2 in the sameissue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> as our proposal to amend Part 3 of the regulations,titled ``Standards.'' The revised rules reflect our consideration of thenearly 8,000 comments received, our experience in administering and enforcingthe regulations, and our ongoing consultation with the U.S. Departmentof Health and Human Services and other interested agencies. It is our presentdetermination that upon their adoption as final rules, the revised provisionsof Parts 1 and 2 will conform with the requirements of the Animal WelfareAct, as amended.Accordingly, we are publishing Parts 1 and 2 at this time, revised fromour initial proposal, as explained in detail below, to assist the publicin reviewing the proposed standards for Part 3. At the urging of many commenters,we are publishing the revised rules for Parts 1 and 2 as a proposal, forthe sole purpose of soliciting comments on the narrow issue of the interrelationshipof the definitions and regulations in Parts 1 and 2 with the standardswe are proposing in Part 3. The public is therefore invited to commentexclusively on this issue. We will not consider comments going beyond thisissue.<ITAG tagnum="84">General</ITAG>We received 307 comments (281 from the research community, 25 from membersof the general public, and 1 from an exhibitor) generally endorsing thedefinitions as proposed but suggesting that some require clarificationor revision. We received 74 comments (72 from the research community and2 from dealers) citing the need for reorganization of the proposed regulationsas a whole (Parts 1 and 2), and for clarification in general. We have furtherclarified or revised those definitions as necessary, based upon the commentsreceived.Sixteen commenters from the research community felt generally that thedefinitions as proposed are too rigid and specific. We disagree. The proposeddefinitions must be specific to be meaningful to the persons subject tothe Act and to the regulations, and to enable those persons to comply withthe regulations. Except as explained below, the provisions of the initialproposed rule for Part 1 continue to be included in this revised rule basedon the reasons set forth in that proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Unit</ITAG>The 1985 amendments to the Act require that each research facility establishan Institutional Animal Committee composed of not fewer than three members(7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(1)). Of the three members, at least one must be a doctorof veterinary medicine and at least one must not be affiliated in any waywith the facility, other than as a member of the Committee. Section 13(b)(1)(C)of the Act provides that ``in those cases where the Committee consistsof more than three members, not more than three members shall be from thesame administrative unit of such facility.'' (7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(1)(C).)In our March 31, 1987, proposal to amend Part 2 of the regulations, weproposed requirements in andSection; 2.35 for the composition of the Committee.As mandated by the Act, proposed andSection; 2.35(a)(6) provided that ``[i]fthe Committee consists of more than three members, not more than threemembers shall be from the same administrative unit of such facility; ** *'' This provision is included in Part 2, as revised, published elsewherein this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. (See companion docket No. 88-014.)We received 465 comments (440 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) requesting that the term ``administrative unit''be defined. We are therefore including the following definition of thatterm:<ITAG tagnum="21">The organizational or management unit at the departmental level ofa research facility.</ITAG>For universities, corporations, and other research facilities, departmentssuch as the Department of Medicine, Department of Research and Development,the Department of Chemistry, the Department of Pharmacology, the Departmentof Psychology, and the Department of Zoology would each be an administrativeunit for purposes of Committee membership.<ITAG tagnum="84">Ambient temperature</ITAG>Three commenters stated that the proposed definition of the term ``ambienttemperature'' is vague. Except for the addition of the word ``air'' before``temperature'' the proposed definition has been in the regulations since1970. We have not learned of any problems in understanding and applyingthis term during the past 18 years. In the absence of any problems arisingfrom the definition of ``ambient temperature'' the definition remains asinitially proposed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Animal; Dog; Cat</ITAG>We proposed to define the term ``animal'' as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">any live or dead dog, cat, nonhuman primate (monkey, ape), guineapig, hamster, rabbit, or any other warmblooded animal, which is being used,or is intended for use for research, teaching, testing, experimentation,or exhibition purposes, or as a pet. This term excludes: Birds, rats andmice bred for use in research, and horses and other farm animals, suchas, but not limited to livestock or poultry, used or intended for use asfood or fiber, or livestock or poultry used or intended for use for improvinganimal nutrition, breeding, management, or production efficiency, or forimproving the quality of food or fiber. With respect to a dog, the termmeans all dogs including those used for hunting, security, or breedingpurposes.</ITAG>This proposed definition prompted numerous comments, although the onlysubstantive change we proposed to make in the current definition was todelete the phrase ``which is domesticated or raised in captivity or whichnormally can be found in the wild state.'' This qualifying phrase modifies``any other warmblooded animal'' in the current definition. We received318 comments (293 from the research community and 25 from members of thegeneral public) generally endorsing the proposed definition. More than1,000 commenters (991 from the general public, 24 from the research community,and 2 dealers) stated that the definition should encompass all warmbloodedanimals, including rats, mice, birds, and farm animals. We received 322comments (297 from the research community and 25 from members of the generalpublic) stating their agreement with excluding laboratory rats and micefrom the definition.When first enacted in 1966 the Act defined the term ``animal'' as meaning``live dogs, cats, monkeys (nonhuman primate mammals), guinea pigs, hamsters,and rabbits.'' In 1970 the definition was amended to include other warm-bloodedanimals, and to specifically exclude horses ``not used for research purposes''and other farm animals when used for agricultural purposes.Since the Animal Welfare regulations were amended in 1972 to incorporatethe 1970 amendments to the Act, the definition of ``animal'' has includedthe six kinds of animals listed above and ``any other warmblooded animal,which is domesticated or raised in captivity or which normally can be foundin the wild state, and is being used, or is intended for use, for research,testing, experimentation, or exhibition purposes, or as a pet.'' The definitionof ``animal'' has excluded ``birds, rats and mice, and horses and otherfarm animals, such as, but not limited to livestock or poultry, used orintended for use as food or fiber, or livestock or poultry used or intendedfor use for improving animal nutrition, breeding, management, or productionefficiency, or for improving the quality of food or fiber.''We are not changing our definition of ``animal'' to include horses notused for biomedical research, and other farm animals when used for agriculturalpurposes, because the Act does not give us authority to include them (7U.S.C. 2132(g)). Neither are we changing our definition of ``animal'' toinclude birds, rats and mice. We do have the authority to regulate theseanimals, though except for wild rats and mice, we have never covered themin our regulations. However, in response to the comments we received, weare considering developing regulations and standards for them. Developmentof new regulations and standards requires detailed analysis of the issuesinvolved, followed by drafting of proposed rules. It is a time-consumingprocess. We do not believe it would be in the best interests of animalwelfare in general if we were to delay promulgating the regulations wehave proposed. We also do not believe Congress intended that we delay promulgatingregulations concerning other animals pending the possible development anddrafting of regulations and standards for birds, rats and mice. Therefore,we are not changing our proposed definition of ``animal'' to include birds,rats and mice in this rule. If we propose regulations and standards governingbirds, rats and mice, we will also propose to amend the definition of ``animal''to include them. We do want to note that wild rats and mice are coveredby our proposed definition, though laboratory-bred rats and mice are not.We are revising the definition of ``animal'' to clarify this point.We received 303 comments (278 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) suggesting that we delete the reference to ``allwarmblooded animals'' in the preamble statement that ``[a]ll warmbloodedanimals are covered by the Act,'' because it is misleading. Although thepreamble to a proposed rule does not have the force of law, we agree thatthis reference could have been more precise since the Act excludes certainwarmblooded animals, such as horses and farm animals, not used for researchpurposes.We received 103 comments (102 from the research community and 1 from amember of the general public) stating that the definition of ``animal''should not include reference to ``dead'' animals, and 5 comments from theresearch community suggesting that when the regulations are meant to includedead animals the term should be so qualified. The Act defines ``animal''as both live or dead animals (7 U.S.C. 2132(g)), and accordingly the AnimalWelfare regulations have defined ``animal'' in this manner since 1972.The word ``dead'' was added to the definition of ``animal'' as part ofthe 1970 amendments to the Act, due to the mistreatment of animals obtainedfor euthanasia and preparation as laboratory specimens. Inclusion of deadanimals in the regulations is determined to be necessary based upon ourexperience in enforcing the regulations, to prevent abuse of these animals.We agree that many of the standards proposed in companion docket number87-004, Part 3_``Standards,'' published elsewhere in this issue of the<T4>Federal Register</T4>, would not apply to dead animals, and we haveadded footnotes to proposed Subparts A and D in Part 3, to make clear thatthose standards would refer to live animals unless otherwise specified.We received 50 comments from the research community stating that the definitionof ``cat'' likewise should not include reference to dead cats. We disagree,since the Act defines animal as any ``live or dead dog, cat, * * *'' andsince our experience indicates the necessity to include this protectionin the regulations for the reasons explained above. No change is made tothe definition of ``cat'' in this rule.Thirty-two commenters from the research community stated that the definitionof ``dog'' should not include the word ``dead.'' For the same reasons providedabove regarding animals and cats, no change is made in the definition of``dog'' in the rule.We received 2 comments from the research community stating that all rodents,including gerbils and guinea pigs, should be excluded from the regulations.Guinea pigs have been included in the Act since it was first enacted in1966. At that time the Act covered 6 kinds of animals: Dogs, cats, guineapigs, hamsters, rabbits, and nonhuman primates. Gerbils became a regulatedspecies when the 1970 amendments to the Act expanded the definition of``animal'' to include ``such other warm-blooded animal, as the Secretarymay determine is being used, or is intended for use for research, testing,* * *.'' We do not have the authority to remove these animals from thecoverage of the regulations. No change is made to the definition of ``animal''based upon these comments.Thirty-one commenters from the research community stated that the definitionof ``animal'' should refer to ``nonhuman primates (monkeys and apes)''instead of to ``monkey (nonhuman primate mammal).'' We agree that use ofthe term ``nonhuman primates'' is more precise because all nonhuman primates,not just monkeys and apes, are covered by the regulations. We are revisingthe definition of ``animal'' to reflect this change. Except for this revision,the definition of ``animal'' remains as initially proposed.Attending veterinarian; Licensed veterinarianThe definition of ``attending veterinarian'' as initially proposed wouldmean:<ITAG tagnum="21">a person who has graduated from a veterinary school accredited bythe American Veterinary Medical Association's Council on Education or hasa certificate issued by the American Veterinary Medical Association's EducationCommission for Foreign Veterinary Graduates, has received training and/orexperience in the care and management of the species being attended, andwho has direct or delegated responsibility for activities involving animalsat a registered or licensed facility. The veterinarian must be accreditedby the U.S. Department of Agriculture in accordance with regulations issuedunder the Animal Welfare Act.</ITAG>We received 548 comments (519 from the research community, 2 from dealers,1 from an exhibitor, and 26 from members of the general public) statingthat reference to USDA accreditation should be deleted from the definitionof ``attending veterinarian'' and that the requirement to be accreditedby USDA be clarified vis-a-vis state licensure requirements. Eleven commentersfrom the research community suggested that we use a term other than ``accredited.''There is no requirement for state licensure in the definition. Our useof the term ``accredited'' was intended as a means of ensuring that attendingveterinarians have training and/or experience in animal welfare, includinghumane handling, care, and treatment of laboratory animals, in order toprovide adequate veterinary care in accordance with the Animal Welfareregulations. We agree that another term, such as ``registered,'' shouldbe substituted for the term, ``accredited,'' to avoid confusion with theAccreditation of Veterinarian regulations in 9 CFR Parts 160, 161, and162. The Department is in the process of developing standards for ``accreditation''(or ``registration'') under the Animal Welfare regulations, for publicationas a proposed rule at a later date. In the interim, we are removing thereferences to ``accreditation'' from Parts 1 and 2, as revised.The proposed definition generated numerous comments expressing concernthat otherwise qualified veterinarians would not satisfy the terms of thedefinition and would not be eligible to serve as attending veterinarians.We received 114 comments from the research community stating that underthe proposed definition there would be an inadequate number of qualifiedor trained veterinarians to satisfy the demand for them. Five commentersexpressed particular concern that otherwise qualified veterinarians mightnot be eligible to be attending veterinarians because they are graduatesof foreign schools and do not have a certificate issued by the AmericanVeterinary Medical Association's (AVMA) Education Commission for ForeignVeterinary Graduates. The definition as originally proposed would excludegraduates of European programs who can be licensed to practice in somestates which do not require certification by the AVMA Education Commissionfor Foreign Veterinary Graduates. These veterinarians would not be allowedto serve as attending veterinarians even within the state of licensureunder the terms of the definition.It was never our intent to disqualify otherwise qualified foreign educatedveterinarians. We are revising the definition to include those veterinarianswho are determined by the Administrator to have equivalent formal education.We believe that there will be an adequate supply of veterinarians satisfyingthe revised definition of ``attending veterinarian.''Similarly, the definition of ``licensed veterinarian'' is changed to includethose who graduated from an accredited school of veterinary medicine orwho have received equivalent formal education, as determined by the Administrator,and are licensed to practice veterinary medicine in some state.The initially proposed definition of ``attending veterinarian'' would requiretraining and/or experience in the care and management of the species beingattended. We received 407 comments (378 from the research community, 3from exhibitors, and 26 from members of the general public) stating thatthis requirement is vague. Five dealers commented that veterinarians shouldnot be required to have experience with the particular species being attended.We disagree since the variation among the different species of animalsrequires that the attending veterinarian be familiar with the differentrequirements to promote the animals' welfare. We also believe the terms``care and management'' are commonly understood and applied in animal husbandryand are adequate to provide guidance to attending veterinarians. Accordingly,we are retaining this requirement in the revised definition.Four commenters stated their concern that the proposed definition of ``attendingveterinarian'' would improperly shift responsibility from the InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee (Committee) to the ``Attending Veterinarian.''Three commenters from the research community stated that we should substitutethe word ``authority'' for ``responsibility'' in the definition.The Committee, or IACUC, has defined areas of responsibility and authorityunder the Act and the regulations, and the definition of ``attending veterinarian''does not shift this burden. However, to make this clear, we are incorporatingthe suggested wording change to alleviate any concern that the ``attendingveterinarian'' would have responsibilities which properly belong to theCommittee. Moreover, the facility, in accordance with Part 2 of the regulations,as revised, is responsible for activities involving animals and for establishingand maintaining the Committee.The definition of ``attending veterinarian'' would be as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">a person who has graduated from a veterinary school accredited bythe American Veterinary Medical Association's Council on Education, orhas a certificate issued by the American Veterinary Medical Association'sEducation Commission for Foreign Veterinary Graduates, or has receivedequivalent formal education as determined by the Administrator; has receivedtraining and/or experience in the care and management of the species beingattended; and who has direct or delegated authority for activities involvinganimals at a registered or licensed facility.</ITAG>Business hoursWe received a number of comments regarding the proposed definition of ``businesshours'' as meaning ``the hours between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., Monday throughFriday, except for statutory Federal holidays, each week of the year.''We received 449 comments (424 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that the proposed hours are not the normalbusiness hours for licensees and research facilities. We received 394 comments(332 from the research community, 22 from dealers, 9 from exhibitors, and31 from members of the general public) stating that business hours shouldde defined as the normal business hours of the regulated entity, and 51commenters (18 dealers and 33 from the research community) stated thatbusiness hours should be an 8-hour period between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Weagree that some clarification of the definition is necessary to make clearour intent that for some reasonable time during the hours from 7 a.m. to7 p.m. daily, every facility must make its animal housing facility(ies),animal use areas, and records available for APHIS inspection without anappointment or scheduled inspection being required. The facility wouldnot have to be open during all hours between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., and couldbe open fewer than 8 hours. For example, if a facility is open from noonuntil 7 p.m., it must be available for inspection at all times during thosehours.Accordingly, the definition of ``business hours'' is revised to be ``areasonable number of hours between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., Monday through Friday,except for statutory Federal holidays, each week of the year, during whichinspections by APHIS may be made.''Under this revised definition, facilities must be available for APHIS inspectionevery Monday through Friday, and not just on the days they are open forbusiness or trade, since some facilities may be part-time operations orseasonal businesses but maintain animals year-round. The proposed rangeof hours would help avoid problems we have encountered in the past withsome facilities which seem never to be open when APHIS inspectors arrive,or which purport to be open only at ``other'' times.Commerce Two commenters from the research community stated that the proposed definitionof ``commerce'' should be clarified. We do not believe that the definitionis unclear. We believe that the changes made to the current definitionto indicate that intrastate activities are considered to be in commercefor purposes of the Act, and the inclusion of trade, traffic, transportation,or other commerce with any foreign country, will aid understanding of theterm. The definition of ``commerce'' remains as proposed. Committee We received a number of comments concerning the proposed definition of``Committee.'' We received 311 comments (286 from the research communityand 25 from members of the general public) stating that the InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee should be given the name used in the Act,that is, the Institutional Animal Committee, and 308 commenters (283 fromthe research community and 25 members of the general public) stated thatresearch facilities should be given flexibility to identify the Committeeby whatever name it selects. We received 121 comments from the researchcommunity stating that there is no statutory authority for requiring establishmentof a Committee. This contention is incorrect. Section 13(b) of the Actauthorizes the Secretary to require that each research facility establishat least one Institutional Animal Committee composed of members with sufficientability ``to assess animal care, treatment, and practices in experimentalresearch * * *'' (7 U.S.C. 2143(b)). We proposed the name ``InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee'' because it is descriptive of the areasof concern to the Committee, while the name ``Institutional Animal Committee''is general and could lead to concern that the Committee would be involvedin areas beyond the scope of the regulations. Our concern is not with thename assigned to the Committee by a facility, but that the Committee, regardlessof its name, carry out its responsibilities and duties. We proposed thisname for purposes of uniformity and ease of reference. The definition of``Committee,'' including the name ``Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee'',remains as originally proposed.Endangered species We received one comment from the research community stating that the proposeddefinition of ``endangered species'' should be more specific than ``thosespecies defined in the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531, <T3>et seq.</T3>) and as it may be subsequently amended.'' Another commentfrom the research community stated that the definition should read any``endangered or threatened species as listed under the Endangered SpeciesAct of 1973 as amended.'' The Endangered Species Act includes species whichare determined to be endangered or threatened because of certain factorsset forth in the statute. Accordingly, our proposed definition encompassesthe definition suggested by the latter commenter. We believe it is impracticalto be more specific in the definition of ``endangered species,'' sincethe list of species covered by the Endangered Species Act is a changingone, with additions and deletions. Euthanasia We received 324 comments (299 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that the definition of ``euthanasia'' shouldnot refer to ``immediate'' death and that unconsciousness need only berapid and not ``instantaneous.'' As stated in the Supplementary Informationaccompanying the March 31, 1987 proposed rule, we believe our proposaldescribes humane destruction of an animal. Deletion of the requirementthat death be ``immediate'' and requiring instead that unconsciousnessneed only be rapid instead of instantaneous could result in use of lesshumane methods of euthanasia which in turn could result in prolonged sufferingby the animals. No changes have been made in the definition. The Supplementary Information accompanying the definition of ``euthanasia''stated that the method used should be consistent with the recommendationsof the AVMA's current Panel on Euthanasia. Eight commenters from the researchcommunity stated that the definition of ``euthanasia'' should set forththe specific AVMA recommendations on methods of euthanasia. We received317 comments (292 from the research community and 25 from members of thegeneral public) stating that all reference to the AVMA Panel on Euthanasiarecommendations should be removed from the proposal since the AVMA Panelis an independent body, not subject to APHIS direction. We disagree withthese comments for the following reasons. The definition as originallyproposed would allow use of any humane method for euthanizing animals anddoes not refer to the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia recommendations. We believeit is appropriate to allow facilities to determine which humane methodthey wish to use. If there is a question as to whether a certain methodwould be considered humane, we will issue a written opinion, upon request.We believe that the recommendations of the AVMA's current Panel on Euthanasiawould meet the requirements of the proposed definition. For that reason,we referred to the recommendations in the Supplementary Information toprovide further guidelines to facilities in determining what methods willbe considered humane. This reference is not part of the regulations. Exotic animal We received 358 comments (333 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that the definition of ``exotic animal''as proposed would include nonhuman primates, hamsters, and some other rodents,and that these species should be excluded from this term. Five commenters(2 from the research community, 1 exhibitor, 1 dealer, and 1 member ofthe general public) stated that the proposed definition is confusing ingeneral. The proposal defined ``exotic animal'' as: <ITAG tagnum="21">any animal not identified in the definition of ``animal'' providedin this Part that is native to a foreign country or of foreign origin orcharacter, is not native to the United States, or was introduced from abroad.This term specifically includes animals such as, but not limited to, lions,tigers, leopards, elephants, camels, llamas, antelope, anteaters, kangaroos,and water buffalo. Species of foreign domestic cattle, such as, Ankole,Gayal, Yak are included in this group. </ITAG>We agree that there could be some confusion as a result of the definition,since many animals commonly found in the United States or generally notconsidered exotic are ``not native to the United States, or were introducedfrom abroad.'' In fact many species of dogs are not native to the UnitedStates. Therefore, we are clarifying the definition to exclude those animalsspecifically included in the definition of ``animal.'' We are also removingllamas from the definition of ``exotic animal'' in this revised rule becauseof the increasing numbers of llamas used on farms for breeding purposes.Farm animal We received 319 comments (294 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that the proposed definition of ``farm animal''is confusing since it defines farm animals in terms of their use ratherthan their species. Seven commenters stated that our definition shouldbe consistent with the definition of ``animal'' as set forth in the AnimalWelfare Act. The Act excludes the following animals from the definitionof ``animal'': <ITAG tagnum="21">horses not used for research purposes and other farm animals, suchas, but not limited to livestock or poultry, used or intended for use asfood or fiber, or livestock or poultry used or intended for improving animalnutrition, breeding, management or production efficiency, or for improvingthe quality of food or fiber. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The proposed definition is consistent with the definition of ``animal''provided in the Act, in that it is the use or intended use which excludesfarm animals from the Act, not their species. We are expanding the definitionto include all the uses listed in the Act, in accordance with the commenters'suggestion, to avoid confusion. Four commenters stated that the definition should refer to ``warmblooded''domestic species to be consistent with the definition of ``animal.'' Webelieve that this is unnecessary since ``animal,'' as defined in the regulations,is limited to warmblooded species and there is no need to further identifyfarm animals as warmblooded.  As stated above, we are including llamas in the definition of farm animalswhen used or intended for use as farm animals, as set forth in the Act.Housing facilityWe received 60 comments from the research community objecting to the proposeddefinition of ``housing facility'' as ``any land, premises, shed, barnbuilding, trailer, or other structure or area housing or intended to houseanimals.'' These commenters stated that ``housing facility'' should berenamed ``animal facility'' and that these facilities should be distinguishedfrom ``animal study area,'' ``acute research study area,'' ``chronic researchstudy area,'' and ``holding facility.'' We have considered those commentsbut do not agree with them. We believe there is no reason to distinguishanimal study area, acute research study areas, chronic research study areas,and holding facilities for purposes of the standards, since these areasare all included within housing facilities and are subject to inspectionand compliance with the regulations regardless of their name or researchpurpose. Also, the term ``housing facility'' applies to any facility usedby any person subject to the Act to house animals, and is not limited toresearch facilities. The regulations pertaining to housing facilities containedin Part 2_``Regulations'' and the proposed rule for Part 3_``Standards'',published elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (see companion docket nos. 88-014 and 87-004,respectively), are equally applicable to all persons subject to the Actand to all parts of housing facilities. The definition remains as originallyproposed.Hybrid crossFourteen commenters from the research community objected to the proposeddifferentiation between domestic and wild hybrid cross animals and statedthat all hybrids should be considered wild animals. The general consensuswithin the Agency remains that hybrid cross animals should be consideredto be domesticated animals. For this reason and for the reasons providedin the Supplementary Information accompanying the March 31, 1987 proposedrule, the definition of ``hybrid cross'' remains as initially proposed.Impervious surfaceThe proposed definition of ``impervious surface'' includes the requirementthat ``[f]luids on such surfaces will bead or run off, * * *''. We received363 comments (338 from research community and 25 from members of the generalpublic) objecting to this portion of the definition because some nonpermeablefloor surfaces will not cause fluids to bead up or fun off, but otherwisedo meet the definition of ``impervious surface.'' We agree that this canbe the case with some impervious surfaces and are modifying this provisionin the definition. Our concern is that the surfaces be those that can bereadily cleaned and that they not absorb material which could contaminatethe surface and cause problems with sanitization. The definition, as revised,includes surfaces on which fluid beads up and runs off and surfaces fromwhich fluids can be removed without their being absorbed into the surfacematerial.Two dealers and two commenters from the research community stated thatsome species do not require impervious surfaces and that for some speciesimpervious surfaces may in fact be detrimental to their well-being. Weagree, and have addressed these situations in the standards provided inthe proposed rule for Part 3_``Standards'', published elsewhere in thisissue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> in companion docket no. 87-004. Those proposedstandards require impervious surfaces in defined instances.We received 317 comments (292 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that the requirements that impervious surfacesnot retain odors is inappropriate since odors are a function of cleaningand not the surface. We disagree, since some surfaces absorb disturbingodors regardless of how well they are cleaned. This requirement remainsin the definition.Indoor housing facilityWe received 352 comments (326 from the research community, 25 from membersof the general public, and 1 from an exhibitor) stating that the requirementthat an ``indoor housing facility'' must be capable of maintaining humiditylevels of 30 to 70 percent is too rigid and should be deleted from thedefinition. We disagree, and we believe the required range of a 30 to 70percent humidity level is a reasonable one. Most species of animals thatwould be housed in indoor housing facilities require humidity levels withinthis range for their general health and welfare. This is reflected in thestandards provided in the proposed rule for Part 3_``Standards'' and publishedelsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> in companion docket no. 87-004. We do not believecompliance with this requirement will prove burdensome. Facilities receivingNIH funds for research currently must provide assurance that they are incompliance with the requirements contained in the NIH Guide for the Careand Use of Laboratory Animals. The Guide provides humidity levels withinthis same range for dogs, cats, and nonhuman primates. The Guide providesa range of 40 to 70 percent for most other warmblooded animals. Moreover,since 1967, indoor housing facilities have been required under our regulationsto have the capability of controlling the environment within the facility.The definition remains as originally proposed.InspectorIn the March 31, 1987 proposal, we proposed to define the term, ``VeterinaryServices representative,'' as ``any inspector or other person employedby the Department who is responsible for the performance of a functionunder the Act.'' (In accordance with a change in internal policy, the term,``Veterinary Services representative,'' has been replaced with ``APHISofficial'' in the revised rule.) The term ``inspector'' also appears inPart 2 and 3 of the regulations (see companion docket nos. 88-014 and 87-004,respectively) but was not separately defined in the March 31, 1987 proposal.We believe it would be helpful to the public to define the term ``inspector.''Because an inspector is an APHIS official, the definition of each termwould be the same. Accordingly, the term ``inspector'' is defined to mean``any person employed by the Department who is authorized to perform afunction under the Act and the regulations in 9 CFR Parts 1, 2, and 3.''Major operative experimentWe received 74 comments, all from the research community, stating thatthe definition of ``major operative experiment'' should be changed from``any surgical intervention that penetrates and exposes a body cavity orthat has the potential for producing a permanent disability'' to any surgicalintervention that both penetrates and exposes a major body cavity and/oris intended to cause physical or physiological impairment. We disagree.It is necessary to define this term since the 1985 amendments to the Actplainly require standards providing that no animal be used in more thanone major operative experiment from which it is allowed to recover, except(1) in cases of scientific necessity, (2) in cases of special circumstancesas determined by the Secretary, or (3) when otherwise required by a researchprotocol (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(3) (D) and (E)). There is no basis under theAct for requiring that a procedure result in an actual impairment or thatit be performed with the established intent of causing physical or physiologicalimpairment for it to be termed a ``major operative experiment.'' The intendedeffect in performing a procedure cannot be relied upon to determine whethera procedure should be termed ``major'' or ``minor'' since that effect mayor may not be accomplished. We consider that the potential for disabilityis sufficient to warrant considering the procedure to be ``major.'' Wedo not regulate the intent underlying experimentation, and intent shouldnot enter into a definition of what is considered to be a ``major operativeexperiment.'' The definition remains as originally proposed.Mobile or traveling housing facilityOur proposal, published elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(see companion docket no. 87-004), to revisePart 3, Subparts A and D, would allow dogs, cats, and nonhuman primatesto be maintained in four different types of animal housing facilities:indoor, outdoor, sheltered, and mobile or traveling housing facilities.Definitions for indoor, outdoor, and sheltered animal housing facilitieswere included in our March 31, 1987 proposal to revise Part 1 (see 52 FR10292-10298). However, no definition of the term ``mobile or travelinghousing facility'' was proposed. Therefore, we are adding a definitionof the term as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">a transporting vehicle, such as a truck, trailer, or railway car,used to house animals while traveling for exhibition or public educationpurposes.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">These purposes would include circuses, carnivals, traveling zoos,education exhibits, and traveling animal acts.Non-conditioned animalsOne exhibitor commented that the proposed definition of ``non-conditionedanimal'' is vague. The current definition is ``animals which have not beensubjected to special care and treatment for sufficient time to stabilizeand, where necessary, to improve their health to make them more suitablefor research purposes.'' Since 1967 the definition of this term has beensubstantially as we proposed, except that the definition referred onlyto animals intended for use in research facilities. The proposed definitiondeletes the phrase ``to make them more suitable for research purposes,''making the term applicable to animals used by all persons subject to theAct and the regulations. We believe this change is necessary since it isequally applicable to animals held by dealers and exhibitors and to animalsin transport. We inadvertently did not explain this change in the SupplementaryInformation to the proposed rule. The definition remains as proposed inthe March 31, 1987 proposal.Outdoor housing facilityThe current definition of ``outdoor housing facility'' is ``any structureor building, housing or intended to house animals, which does not meetthe definition of ``indoor housing facility''.'' In the March 31, 1987proposal and in this rule, we added a definition for another type of housingfacility, known as a ``sheltered housing facility.'' Accordingly, we proposedto define the term ``outdoor housing facility'' as a structure, land, orpremise, housing or intended to house animals, which does not meet thedefinition of an indoor housing facility or a sheltered housing facilityand in which temperatures cannot be controlled within set limits.'' Revisingthe definition became necessary because a sheltered housing facility isneither an outdoor nor an indoor housing facility. In this document, weare also adding a definition of the term, ``mobile or traveling housingfacility,'' which is another type of housing facility that may be usedto house animals under the regulations. (Proposed specifications pertainingto sheltered and mobile or traveling animal housing facilities when usedto house dogs, cats, and nonhuman primates appear in the proposed rulefor Part 3_``Standards,'' companion docket no. 87-004, published elsewherein this issue of the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>To avoid having to amend the definition of ``outdoorhousing facility'' each time another type of housing facility is authorizedfor use under the regulations, we are revising the definition in this ruleto mean ``a structure, land, or premise, housing or intended to house animals,which does not meet the definition of any other type of housing facilityprovided in the regulations and in which temperatures cannot be controlledwithin set limits.''Three commenters (2 from the research community and 1 exhibitor) statedthat a more stringent definition of ``outdoor housing facility'' is necessary.We believe that this is unnecessary and could prove to be too limitingin application. We encourage the design and development of animal facilitieswhich provide animals with natural environments appropriate for the speciesof animal housed and which allow ready access to runs and similar areasfor exercise and social interaction. We believe that providing a more exactingdefinition could discourage the construction of animal housing facilitiesof this type.Painful procedureWe received 345 comments (320 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that the definition of ``painful procedure''should be revised to be consistent with the ``U.S. Government Principlesfor the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research,and Training'' which appears in the U.S. Public Health Service Policy onHumane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (``PHS Policy''). All PHS-conductedor supported activities involving animals must comply with the PHS Policy.Principle V provides that ``[p]rocedures with animals that may cause morethan momentary or slight pain or distress should be performed with appropriatesedation, analgesia, or anethesia. Surgical or other painful proceduresshould not be performed on unanesthetized animals paralyzed by chemicalagents.'' We used similar language in the proposed definition of ``painfulprocedure'' and, as provided in Principle IV, we proposed using human beingsas the reference point for determining whether a procedure is a ``painfulprocedure.'' Principle IV states that ``[u]nless the contrary is established,investigators should consider that procedures that cause pain or distressin human beings may cause pain or distress in other animals.'' We believethat our proposed definition is consistent with the PHS Policy and withthe advice of the commenters, and that no revision is necessary. We received142 comments from the research community stating that this approach istoo anthropomorphic. We believe that using human standards of pain is necessaryto properly define when a procedure is to be considered painful and tomake the definition meaningful to those persons applying it. The definitionremains as originally proposed.Paralytic drugIn accordance with section 13(a)(3)(C)(iv) of the Act, (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(3)(C)(iv)),andSection; 2.30(e)(9) of the revised rule for Part 2 (see companion docketno. 88-014) provides that each research facility that engages in a painfulpractice or procedure using an animal must prohibit the use of paralyticdrugs without anesthesia. Section 2.30(e)(10), as revised, would requirethat the research facility establish a written policy to ensure compliancewith the prohibition. These provisions were originally proposed in andSection;2.30(e)(4) at 52 FR 10312.We received 31 comments from the research community in response to theproposed rule stating that the term ``paralytic drug'' should be defined.We agree and are adding a definition of the term as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">a drug which causes partial or complete loss of muscle contractionand which has no anesthetic or analgesic properties, so that the animalcannot move, but is completely aware of its surroundings and can feel pain.</ITAG>This definition is in accordance with the generally accepted usage of theterm among professionals and professional organizations and is consistentwith the intent of the Act. <T3>Pet animal </T3>We received 5 comments (4 from the research community and 1 from a dealer)stating that the definition of ``pet animal'' should exclude exotic orwild animals. We agree and intended to exclude them by using the phrase``any animal that has commonly been kept as a pet animal'' in the definition.To clarify this point further we are adding examples of common householdpets to the definition, such as dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and hamsters.<T3>Positive physical contact </T3>Our proposal to amend Part 3, Subpart A (see companion docket no. 87-004),would require that individually housed dogs receive positive physical contactwith humans. We are adding a definition of the term ``positive physicalcontact'' as it is commonly understood by the public, that is, ``petting,stroking, or other touching, which is beneficial to the well-being of theanimal.'' <T3>Primary enclosure </T3>We did not receive any comments addressing the proposed definition of ``primaryenclosure.'' We are replacing the word ``chain'' in the rule with ``tether,''however, to include all like devices used to restrict an animal's radiusof movement. <T3>Principal investigator (investigator) </T3>The revised rule for Part 2 of the regulations (see companion docket no.88-014) would require that research facilities impose certain duties andresponsibilities on the principal investigator in planning and carryingout the animal care and use procedure (ACUP) of a research project. Weare adding a definition of the term ``principal investigator'' as ``anemployee of a research facility responsible for a proposal to conduct researchand for the design and implementation of research involving animals.''This is the meaning of the term as it is used in the research community.It is also the meaning of the term as it is used by the U.S. Public HealthService in its ``Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use ofLaboratory Animals.'' The Policy provides guidelines, issued by the U.S.Public Health Service under the Health Research Extention Act of 1985,for the proper care and treatment of animals used in biomedical and behavioralresearch. We are adding the definition to Part 1 of the regulations sothat members of the general public will share the same understanding ofthe term. <T3>Protocol </T3>We proposed to define the term ``Protocol'' as ``an investigator's planfor the use of animals in a study of a biomedical problem.'' We received409 comments (384 from the research community and 25 from members of thegeneral public) objecting to use of the term ``protocol'' and to our proposalto require review and approval of protocols by a facility's InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee. We received 342 comments (317 from the researchcommunity and 25 from members of the general public) stating that the termis not defined in the Animal Welfare Act and should be deleted from theregulations altogether. Although the term is not defined in the Act it does appear in section 13of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2143), which mandates the imposition of certain responsibilitiesupon research facilities and upon their Committee for carrying out thepurposes of the Act. We believe that use of the term ``protocol'' is thereforeproper. We understand from the comments we received that use of this termmay imply to some research facilities that APHIS would be involved in theevaluation of the design, outlines, guidelines, and scientific merit ofproposed research. That is not our intent. Our concern is with the animalcare and use portion of the research, that is, how the research will treator affect an animal, the condition of an animal, and the circumstancesunder which an animal is maintained. Accordingly, to clarify our intentionsand avoid any misunderstanding, the term ``protocol'' is changed in thisrevised rule to ``animal care and use procedure'' (``ACUP''). The definitionis also clarified to include an investigator's plan for the care of animalsin addition to a plan for the use of animals. The comments we received concerning our statutory authority to requirereview of what is now termed the ``animal care and use procedure'' areaddressed in companion docket number 88-014, Part 2_``Regulations,'' publishedelsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Research facility Thirty-seven commenters from the research community stated that the word``biomedical'' should not appear in the definition of ``research facility.''In writing our proposed definition of ``research facility,'' we tried tofollow the language of the Act as closely as possible. This term appearsin the Act's definition of ``research facility'' (7 U.S.C. 2132(e)). Nineteen commenters from the research community stated that the definitionof ``research facility'' should exclude government agencies responsiblefor protection and management of the wildlife resources of a state. Again,in writing our proposed definition of ``research facility,'' we tried tofollow the language of the Act as closely as possible, and the Act allowsno specific exclusion of government agencies of the type described by thecommenters. After carefully considering these comments, we have decided to adopt theAct's definition of ``research facility'' and use it in our regulations.We believe this would avoid confusion and ensure that our regulations accomplishthe intent of the Act. The only change we are making in the definitionis to replace the term ``Secretary'' with the term ``Administrator.'' Retail pet storeIn our proposed definition of ``retail pet store,'' reference to exhibitingnonpet animals was inadvertently omitted, although it was included in theSupplementary Information. We are revising the definition of ``retail petstore'' from that appearing in the March 31, 1987 proposal to exclude establishmentsor persons exhibiting or offering to exhibit any wild or exotic or othernonpet species of warmblooded animals (except birds), such as skunks, raccoons,nonhuman primates, squirrels, ocelots, foxes, coyotes, etc., in additionto those selling or offering to sell these nonpet species. These establishmentsand persons would be required to obtain a license under Part 2 of the regulations.We are also adding a fifth exclusion for retail pet stores that exhibitanimals in a room that is separate from or adjacent to a retail pet store,in an outside area, or anywhere off the pet store premises. If the petanimals are taken off the premises for purposes of exhibition, such asat schools, parades, or shopping malls, or are placed in outside areasor areas adjacent to the pet store for use in a petting zoo-type exhibit,the establishment or person exhibiting the pet animals must obtain a licenseunder Part 2 of the regulations. This exclusion would prevent exhibitorsfrom claiming to be retail pet stores in order to avoid being licensedin accordance with Part 2 of the regulations. We are deleting mink from the list of pet animals sold by retail pet storesin response to a comment regarding the proposed definition of ``wild animal.''We are doing so because of their vicious nature. Mink are not regulatedanimals, however, when used or intended for use solely for food or fiberpurposes. Sanitize We received 4 comments from the research community stating that ``sanitize''should be redefined so as to require removal of dirt, debris and harmfulcontamination, instead of requiring removal and destruction, to the maximumdegree that is practical, of any agents injurious to health. The definitionof ``sanitize'' has been the same as we proposed since 1966. We do notbelieve it appropriate to delete the requirement to destroy injurious agentssince elimination of these agents results in a more healthful environmentfor animals that may be exposed to them. The definition remains as proposed.Sheltered housing facilityThree commenters from the general public stated that the definition of``sheltered housing facility'' should be deleted as this type of facilitycould lead to mistreatment of the housed animals. In the proposed rulefor Part 3_``Standards'' (see companion docket no. 87-004 published elsewherein this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>), we have proposed specifications for this typeof housing facility which include requirements for heating, cooling, ventilation,cleaning, drainage, and lighting. We believe that a sheltered housing facilitywhich is in compliance with these proposed standards can be effectivelyused to house animals in a humane manner in accordance with the Act.Wild animalWe proposed to define ``wild animal'' as:<ITAG tagnum="21">any animal which is now or historically has been found in the wild,or in the wild state, within the boundaries of the United States, its territories,or possessions. This term includes, but is not limited to animals suchas: Buffalo, deer, skunk, opossum, raccoon, armadillo, coyote, squirrel,fox, wolf.</ITAG>One dealer and one member of the general public commented in disagreementwith our proposed definition. One dealer stated that ferrets and mink shouldbe classified as wild animals, and 9 dealers and 2 exhibitors stated thatdeer, llama, and buffalo should be classified as domestic animals. As explainedabove under ``Retail pet store,'' we agree that mink should be considereda ``wild animal'' due to its vicious nature. The definition of ``wild animal''will be changed to include mink. We disagree with the comment with regardto ferrets, however, since they are considered to be easily handled andrelatively nondangerous, and are now commonly bred and kept as pet animals.We also disagree with classifying deer as domestic animals. Although someindividuals may be raised in captivity and would be considered tame, mostdeer are found in the wild. However, we do agree with the commenters withregard to buffalo. Buffalo are nearly extinct in the wild. Most now existin game preserves, where they are displayed in natural settings. Underthese circumstances they are not wild animals. Therefore, we are removingthem from the definition of ``wild animal.'' We are making no change inthe definition of ``wild animal'' with regard to llamas because llamaswere not include as wild animals in our proposed definition of the term.We also want to make it clear that wild rats and mice are included in thedefinition of wild animal, as distinguished from rats and mice bred incaptivity for use in research, and that wild rats and mice are regulatedanimals under the Act.We received no comments concerning the remaining definitions and they remainin this rule as originally proposed.MiscellaneousAs a result of a change in internal policy, the term ``Veterinary Services''is replaced with ``APHIS'' wherever it appears and the definition of ``VeterinaryServices'' is not included in this revised rule. We have defined ``APHIS''to mean ``the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United StatesDepartment of Agriculture.''In order to be consistent with this change in policy, the term ``VeterinaryServices representative,'' is replaced with ``APHIS official.'' We proposedto define the term, ``Veterinary Services representative'' to mean ``anyinspector or other person employed by the Department who is responsiblefor the performance of a function under the Act.'' We have added a definitionof the term ``inspector'' in this revised rule, as explained above. Forthis reason, the definition of ``APHIS official'' does not specificallyrefer to inspectors. We are using the word ``authorized'' in place of ``responsible''in the definition of ``APHIS official'' because the Secretary of Agricultureis responsible for performance under the Act. Department employees areauthorized to perform certain functions. We are also clarifying the definitionby including the performance of functions under the regulations as wellas under the Act, because the regulations are promulgated under the Act.Accordingly, ``APHIS official'' is defined to mean ``any person employedby the Department who is authorized to perform a function under the Actand the regulations in 9 CFR Parts 1, 2, and 3.''We are correcting the following typographical errors which appeared inthe March 31, 1987 proposal:(1) We are correcting two errors in the proposed definition of ``Class``B'' licensee (dealer)''. In the first sentence the reference to ``andSection;1.1(q)'' has been changed to ``andSection; 1.1'' since we are not letteringthe paragraphs, and in the second sentence ``at an auction sale'' has beencorrected to read ``of an auction sale.''(2) We are similarly changing the reference to ``andSection; 1.1(x)'' inthe definition of ``Class ``C'' licensee (exhibitor)'' to ``andSection; 1.1''since we are not lettering the paragraphs.(3) In the definition of ``endangered species,'' the closing parenthesesare placed after the statutory citation instead of the period.Statutory authority for this Proposed RuleThis proposed rule is issued pursuant to the Animal Welfare Act (Act),as amended, 7 U.S.C. 2131-2157. Congress recently added significantly tothe Secretary's responsibilities under the Act by amendments in the FoodSecurity Act of 1985, Pub. L. No. 99-198, approved December 23, 1985. Thedeclared policy of the Act is to ensure that animals intended for use inresearch facilities, as pets, or for exhibition purposes are provided humanecare and treatment; to assure the humane treatment of animals during transportation;and to prevent the sale of stolen animals.The Act mandates that the Secretary of Agriculture promulgate regulationsand standards to govern the humane handling, care, treatment, and transportationof animals by dealers, exhibitors, research facilities, carriers, and intermediatehandlers. To accomplish this, the Secretary must define certain key wordsused in the regulations and standards so that persons subject to the Act,regulations, and standards can comply with their requirements.The Act itself defines some of the terms which appear in this rule. TheAct also authorizes the Secretary to promulgate such rules, including additionaldefinitions, as he deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the Act.Executive Order 12291On March 31, 1987, the Department published proposed rules to amend Part1_``Definition of Terms'' and Part 2_``Regulations,'' of the Animal Welfareregulations (52 FR 10292, 10298) in order to implement the 1985 amendmentsto the Animal Welfare Act, Pub. L. 99-198, the ``Food Security Act.'' Theproposed action was reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12291 and it wasdetermined that it did not constitute a ``major rule.'' We solicited commentswith regard to the proposed rules, and have made modifications to thoserules as explained in the ``Supplementary Information.'' At this time,we are also publishing a proposal to revise the standards contained in9 CFR Part 3_``Standards,'' published elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.In revising Parts 1 and 2, and in preparing the proposed rule for Part3, we assessed the economic effects of the regulations in accordance withthe requirements of Executive Order 12291. We considered alternative approachesto carrying out our statutory mandate, many of which we adopted. A regulatoryimpact analysis of revised Parts 1 and 2, and the proposal for Part 3 wasprepared. Based on that analysis, which included consideration of bothquantifiable and nonquantifiable effects of the rules, the Administratorhas determined that Parts 1 and 2 would have an impact on the economy inexcess of $100 million annually, and would constitute a ``major rule.''The following requirements under Parts 1 and 2 represent some of the majorcosts to the regulated industries: (1) The establishment and responsibilitiesof the animal care and use committees; (2) aseptic surgical facilitiesand adequate pre- and post-procedural care; (3) increased responsibilitiesfor attending veterinarians; (4) additional administrative responsibilities;(5) increases in license fees; and (6) identification for dogs and catsless than 16 weeks of age. The economic impacts of these rules are discussed in more detail in a regulatoryimpact analysis, which is available for public inspection in Room 1141of the South Building, U.S. Department of Agriculture between 8:00 a.m.and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays (address above).Main findings of this analysis are summarized below.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,xs68</C><T4>Summary of Regulatory Impact Analysis</T4><H1>Costs </H1><H1>Benefits</H1>Direct <D>Direct</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Regulated industry <D>Increased public satisfaction from improved animal welfare*.</D></ITAG>Capital expenditure:<ITAG tagnum="2">(all parts) $876 million <D>Improved research information*.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">(parts 1-2) $142 million <D>Productivity gains for regulated industries*.</D></ITAG>Annual costs:<ITAG tagnum="2">(all parts) $207 million</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">(parts 1-2) $126 million</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">APHIS program costs Impact on federal sites* $2 million</ITAG>Indirect <D>Indirect</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Opportunity costs for users of biomedical research (goods and service),pet industry, and animal exhibits* <D>Market effects for suppliers of animal husbandry products*. </D><P>Non-market effects*.</P></ITAG>Increased federal financial support for biomedical community*.Non-market effects*.<F>* Not quantified.</F></ITAG>Compliance with more stringent federal regulations on the humane care andtreatment of animals used for research, testing, teaching, exhibition,and business ventures would result in major direct and indirect effectsimposed on the regulated industries and the general economy. An examinationof the estimated cost impacts indicates that the amended regulations constitutea ``major rule'' based on annual effects in excess of $100 million on theeconomy and large cost increases on regulated industries for animal usesand maintenance, in particular to the biomedical research community. However,this study could not properly assess the relative significance of thesecost increases on the regulated industry or the presence of adverse effectson competition, innovation, and the ability of domestic enterprises tocompete with foreign enterprises in international markets. Regulated persons or establishments will be required to spend approximately$876 million in capital expenditures over the next two or three years.Of this amount approximately 16 percent is attributable to Parts 1 and2. If Parts 1 and 2 were enforced separately, regulated research facilitieswill be required to spend approximately $142 million to renovate, equip,replace, or construct aseptic surgical facilities, and provide for adequateper- and post-surgical care. Capital expenditures attributable to Part3 include costs for renovation, equipment replacement, and new constructionof animal housing facility space. Capital expenditures to improve animalhousing facilities would result from the new minimum standards for generalenvironmental conditions, space or primary enclosure size requirements,exercise of dogs, and enrichment of nonhuman primate enclosures. In addition to capital expenditures, total annual operating exendituresestimated at $207 million will also be required. Approximately 60 percentof this total ($126 million) is accounted for by Parts 1 and 2, primarilythe requirements for the establishment and operations of the institutionalanimal care and use committees, additional responsibilities for attendingveterinarians, and record-keeping requirements. Annual expenditures attributableto Part 3 would result from the need for additional personnel (animal handlers)to execise dogs, and the daily maintenance of animal housing facilities.An important result of this regulatory analysis is that policy decisionsmust consider other direct and indirect effects associated with the promulgationand enforcement of federal rules. Increased federal legislation causesimportant economic benefits and costs which are unevenly distributed amongregistrants and licensees. Direct benefits accrue to society by knowingthat animals may be better cared for and treated humanely. The value ofthese social benefits are subject to personal preferences and concerns.Improvements in the well-being of regulated animals may also provide gainsin productivity to the industry. On the other hand, increased costs ofcompliance will be passed from the regulated industry to consumers whopurchase their goods and services. For example, the field of biomedicalresearch and education depends heavily on the use of animals to conducttests and experiments. Increased costs for animal uses have broader economicand health implications for all of us. Study results do not suggest thatthese regulations would cause establishments to abandon the use of animalssince current biomedical research outlays are in excess of $12.8 billionper year. Nonetheless, there could be important effects associated withallocating additional funds or expenditures to comply with the amendedanimal welfare regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>As part of the regulatory impact analysis performed by the Department wehave analyzed the potential impact on small entities of Parts 1 and 2,as revised, and the proposal to amend Part 3 of the Animal Welfare regulations,as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). Based upon our analysis, we have determined that Parts1 and 2 of the regulations would affect all regulated small entities, primarilyby increases in annual license fees and identification requirements fordogs and cats. However, these economic impacts would not be significant.It is anticipated that the largest impact on small entities would resultfrom Part 3_``Standards'', if it is implemented as proposed. Under thesecircumstances the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService has determined that this action would not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372,which requires intergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.(See 7 CFR 3015, Subpart V.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>In accordance with section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980(44 U.S.C. 3507), the information collection provisions that are includedin this proposed rule will be submitted for approval to the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB).
