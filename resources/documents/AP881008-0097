(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Homeowner Toni DeJonge canempathize with state officials who say it's difficult to convincepeople that colorless, odorless radioactive radon gas collecting intheir homes can be deadly.   ``I brought it up last year at the voting booths and theylaughed me out onto the street. They said, `don't be ridiculous,it's all a scam,''' said Ms. DeJonge. Tests conducted last yearfound that her home had radon levels 45 times the federal safetystandard.   Ms. DeJonge lives in the Whispering Hills development wheretests Sept. 30 found 60 of 75 homes had radon levels above thefederal safety standard. One home had levels 800 times greater thenthe federal standard, possibly the highest ever recorded in ahouse, officials said Thursday.   Officials believe the gas in Clinton Township, a rural communityabout 40 miles west of New York City, rises through the ground fromthe Reading Prong, a formation of uranium-bearing rock that extendsfrom Pennsylvania into New York. Radon is produced by theradioactive decay of uranium.   Health officials say radon is second only to smoking as a causeof lung cancer deaths.   Last year, Ms. DeJonge installed a simple ventilation system inher basement for $950 to alleviate the radon problem, and becamethe town radon crier.   She gave up after consistently meeting with derision fromneighbors who thought it was a hoax perpetrated by the burgeoningradon remediation industry.   The federal standard for radon is 4 picocuries, a unit ofradiation measurement. The federal Environmental Protection Agencyestimates that level is the annual equivalent of smoking one-halfpack of cigarettes a day or having 200 to 300 chest X-rays.   One lhouse tested by the state Department of EnvironmentalProtection in the Whispering Hills development registered 3,500picocuries. State officials said the unidentified homeowner washaving the problem corrected.   State officials canvassed the neighborhood last weekend, urgingresidents to place charcoal-filled canisters in their basements totest for the gas.   But at many homes, they met with slammed doors, suspicion,reluctance, or skepticism. Others said they have tested, but putoff having work done to lower radon levels because they distrustwhat may be hype.   State officials say they continue to battle apathy despitediscoveries of 18 similar clusters in the state where radon isseeping through house foundations and building to dangerous levels.   Calls to a state radon hot line increase tenfold after flurriesof publicity, such as reports last month that 29 percent of homesin seven states had elevated radon levels. But the calls quicklydrop off, officials said.   ``It's not a problem you can see. It's not a problem that can beassociated with a man-made contamination problem. It's a naturalphenomenon that's been here all along,'' said David Martin, vicepresident of Teledyne Isotopes, a radioactive testing firm. ``Radonposes the highest risk to smokers, and if you can't convince peopleto stop smoking it's going to be hard to interest them in radon.''</TEXT></DOC>
