When one of the hotel guests he was robbing complained ofchest pains, the ever-so-polite, dapper, middle-aged thiefasked the desk to call an ambulance. He made off with themoney but phoned later to inquire about the man's condition.</LP><TEXT>   He often will call victims to tell them where he hasabandoned their bank cards after he has withdrawn their fundsfrom teller machines.   When he was through robbing a guest at the Sheraton ParkCentral in Dallas last week, he reportedly untied the guy andchatted with him for about 20 minutes before beating aretreat. &quot;I'm getting tired of doing this,&quot; he confided.   If the perpetrator sounds like Cary Grant in &quot;To Catch aThief,&quot; well, there is a certain resemblance.   Since his crime spree began in May 1989, the GentlemanBandit has robbed 91 hotel guests in Texas and Louisiana. Inthe process, he has thwarted at least 15 state and citylaw-enforcement agencies, bedeviled hostelries in both statesand impressed many with his impeccable manners.   He has also demonstrated how vulnerable hotels and theirguests are to certain sorts of crime.   Security cameras may record every face entering banks andconvenience stores, but photo-free robberies are still quitepossible in hotels. Thus police have no more than a roughidea of what this guy looks like. And hotels, understandablyafraid to spook their clientele, have been reluctant topublicize the problem.   Even seasoned travelers are easily gulled. &quot;Someone whotravels 30 weeks a year develops a confidence and trust --almost a naivete -- about striking up {acquaintanceships} inhotels, and this perpetrator is taking advantage of that,&quot;says Les Tanaka, executive vice president of the HotelAssociation of Greater Dallas.   The Gentleman Bandit inspires trust. In his gray,pin-striped suit, glasses and silver-streaked hair, he is thevery picture of respectability.   He haunts hotel lobbies, sipping coffee and looking fortargets -- people of evident means, men mostly. &quot;A man ismore likely than a woman to let a stranger into his room,&quot;theorizes Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman MichaelCox.   Having spotted his prey, the Gentleman Bandit will followhim to his room and knock on the door, apologizing for thedisturbance. &quot;But darn it,&quot; he will say in his soft SouthTexas drawl, &quot;I just saw you in the lobby, and I'm certain Iknow you. You're not from Columbus, are you?&quot;   Sometimes, he'll ask to borrow a phone book. He is fluentin the language of industries ranging from oil-fieldequipment to real estate and computers, and he has even foundit opportune to claim he is a Christian minister.   Once he has insinuated himself into the room, he willproduce a snub-nosed revolver and, once again, apologize:&quot;I'm really sorry, but this is a robbery.&quot;   His come-on has been hugely successful. Just howsuccessful might never have been known had it not been forSharon Whitman. She is a crimes analyst at the TexasDepartment of Public Safety. She sifts through robberyreports from around the country looking for links to unsolvedcrimes in Texas.   In August 1989, she came upon a robbery report involving afamiliar M.O.: A Houston hotel guest had been held up by anespecially courtly stranger. Recalling a similar reportmonths earlier from Brookshire, Texas, Ms. Whitman trackeddown similar incidents by making inquiries to robbery unitselsewhere in Texas. In some cases, she says, police hadn'tbelieved accounts of crimes: &quot;They thought the victims hadactually been taken by prostitutes or lost money gambling,and just wanted an insurance report.&quot; The Gentleman Banditbit struck police as far-fetched, and they discounted it.   Since then, Ms. Whitman has coordinated the investigation,trying to trace (and predict) the bandit's travels. In twoyears, she has accurately anticipated just two of his strikes-- in Houston and in Lafayette, La. -- and in both cases, hepulled off his jobs despite Ms. Whitman's warnings to localpolice.   Alerting hotel guests to the peril hasn't been easyeither. They don't always see newspaper stories and thecomposite drawing that has been published. And hotels havebeen slow to issue warnings. Only after one of its guests wasrobbed last week did the Sheraton Park Central issue specificwarnings, though hotel officials had known about the banditfor weeks. Indeed, he had hit the Marriott next door twice.Mr. Tanaka, of the hotel association, says hotels don't wantto &quot;unduly alarm&quot; guests, though the trade group herepresents urges that they sound the alarm.   All concerned might be more excited if the GentlemanBandit weren't so nice. He hasn't hurt anybody, and he goesout of his way to demonstrate decency. Doctors should havesuch a bedside manner.   He keeps victims apprised of exactly what he is doing, andhe keeps asking how they are doing. After tying up andblindfolding a victim, he will describe his movements: &quot;Now,I'm walking over to the dresser. I'm opening the top drawernow. I've found your wallet.&quot; Before he leaves, he will say&quot;As soon as you hear the door shut, you can start trying tountie yourself.&quot; Once, in Austin, a victim pleaded that henot take all his money and was left with $20.   Steven Edmondson, a Louisiana rental-equipment executive,says the man who knocked on his door at the La Quinta Inn inDallas last February was so polite he thought it was a jokewhen the man pulled a gun. While tying up another victim, thebandit said he was sorry to be so clumsy: &quot;You'll have toforgive me, I'm a little nervous.&quot;   Although the bandit, in what strikes people as a plea forunderstanding, often tells them he is a drug addict, policearen't so sure about that. They say he doesn't fit theprofile of a man in need of a fix (not nervous enough, notviolent). Police stereotypes of addicts, moreover, don'tallow for the temperament or vocabulary of a man who thankshis victims for &quot;being docile.&quot;   Investigators speculate that this bandit is a travelingsalesman, between 40 and 50, in need of excitement or extracash. With takes ranging from $8 to $700, he generallydoesn't make out like a bandit.   That he is so friendly doesn't impress everyone. &quot;He's aclassic intelligent sociopath who's enjoying the game heplays,&quot; declares James Grigson of Dallas, a nationally knownforensic psychiatrist. &quot;If he were really sorry and concernedabout his victims, he'd quit robbing them.&quot;   And polite though he is, his intentions aren't friendly.Peter Broennimann, a Swiss businessman staying at theDoubletree Hotel in Dallas, says he took a menacing steptoward the gunman, then thought better of it. &quot;He threatenedto shoot my knees,&quot; says Mr. Broennimann, who gave up $600 tothe bandit.   The Gentleman Bandit puts on surgical gloves to avoidleaving fingerprints. And when Daniel Hockman, a Michigancomputer technician staying at a Dallas Marriott, saw that,he says, &quot;I imagined myself winding up in a thousand littlepieces in the trash.&quot;   With this new sense of his own mortality, Mr. Hockman gavethe bandit his $8 and decided it was high time to have thebaby his wife had been wanting. &quot;It turned out to be a goodthing for me,&quot; says Valerie Hockman, now three monthspregnant. The Gentleman Bandit will probably be calling soonto congratulate the happy couple.</TEXT></DOC>
