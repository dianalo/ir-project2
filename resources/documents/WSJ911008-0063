The decision rescues a widely used insider-tradingregulation that appeared to be in jeopardy a year ago after athree-judge appellate panel threw out the conviction. In arare move, the full Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsagreed to review the panel's decision. The full court'sruling was eagerly awaited by law-enforcement officials andcriminal defense attorneys who specialize in white-collarcases.</LP><TEXT>   Prosecutors had warned that the panel's decision wouldhave emasculated the regulation, known as 14e-3. The rulemakes it a crime to trade on inside information about atender offer, even if the defendant isn't violating afiduciary duty by making the trade. The Securities andExchange Commission often relies on Rule 14e-3 ininsider-trading cases against defendants who aren't companyinsiders. The rule is based on the idea that insiders are theonly people who know about tender offers in advance, so thereis no need to require proof that a fiduciary duty wasviolated.   In reinstating the conviction, the full appeals court saidthe SEC acted within its authority in adopting and applyingthe law. It rejected the three-judge panel's finding that adefendant charged with trading on inside information had toknow clearly that the information was confidential.   &quot;Recognizing the highly sensitive nature of tender offerinformation, its susceptibility to misuse, and the oftendifficult task of ferreting out and proving fraud, Congresssensibly delegated to the SEC broad authority to delineate apenumbra around the fuzzy subject of tender-offer fraud,&quot; thefull court said.   Adopting the panel's narrower approach to the SEC'srule-making authority, the full court said, &quot;would cramp theSEC's ability to define fraud flexibly in the context of thediscrete and highly sensitive area of tender offers.&quot;   Mr. Chestman, formerly with Gruntal andamp; Co., was convictedin March 1989 of insider trading in Waldbaum Inc.'s stockjust before the company's takeover in 1986 by Great Atlanticandamp; Pacific Tea Co. His trading was based on information hereceived fourth-hand from an in-law of Waldbaum's formerpresident.   Mr. Chestman had served about 11 months of his two-yearprison sentence when the three-judge panel overturned hisconviction and he was released. Because the full courtvacated a perjury conviction in the case, his total sentencewould have been 18 months, however. Typically defendants insuch cases are released after serving two-thirds of theirsentence. It isn't known whether the government will seek tohave Mr. Chestman returned to prison.   Elkan Abramowitz, Mr. Chestman's attorney, said he wasdisappointed with the decision and is reviewing whether totake it to the Supreme Court. &quot;He remains convicted of afelony based on a rule promulgated by the SEC, as opposed toa criminal statute passed by Congress,&quot; Mr. Abramowitz said.   While reinstating the insider-trading conviction under14e-3, the full appeals court threw out Mr. Chestman'ssecurities and mail-fraud convictions in the case. Mr.Chestman's fraud convictions were for allegedly aiding thetheft of inside information about the Waldbaum takeover.   Prosecutors had charged that Mr. Chestman committedsecurities fraud by trading on inside information that wasgiven to him by a client, Keith Loeb, who was the husband ofthe niece of Waldbaum's president. The government argued thatMr. Loeb had a duty to the Waldbaum family to keep theinformation about the takeover confidential.   But the full appeals court said being related to thefamily wasn't enough to create a fiduciary duty between Mr.Loeb and the company. &quot;First, a fiduciary duty cannot beimposed unilaterally by entrusting a person with confidentialinformation,&quot; the court said. &quot;Second, marriage does not,without more, create a fiduciary relationship.&quot;   The court said that for Mr. Chestman's fraud convictionsto stand, the government would have had to present a strongerpicture of Mr. Loeb's obligation to keep the informationsecret. Mr. Loeb wasn't charged with any wrongdoing.   SEC attorneys, who were reviewing the decision, said theywere concerned that the court's decision regarding thecharges could make it trickier to pursue some insider-tradingcases.   John Carroll, chief of the securities and commodity fraudunit of the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, said, &quot;We'repleased with the court's decision on Rule 14e-3, and we'restudying the rest of the opinion.&quot;   John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law professorwho has written about the issues raised by the Chestman case,said the securities-fraud aspect of the decision follows thethinking of the court in other recent securities decisions.&quot;It is consistent with what I would call the new rigor of theSecond Circuit&quot; in the level of proof it is demanding ofprosecutors in securities cases, Mr. Coffee said.   Harvey Pitt, a criminal-defense attorney in Washington,D.C., and a former SEC general counsel, said the decisionsends a message to prosecutors that &quot;it will be difficult toget more remote participants&quot; in alleged insider-tradingschemes. He and Prof. Coffee both said the ruling alsoreflects the need for Congress to pass a law clearly definingillegal securities trading, rather than leaving it to thecourts to shape that definition.</TEXT></DOC>
