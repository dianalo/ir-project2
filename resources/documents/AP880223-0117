RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court, rejecting claims by privatelandowners, ruled today that the state of Mississippi ownsthousands of acres of oil- and gas-rich land near the state's GulfCoast.   By a 5-3 vote, the justices said states may claim title to landbeneath waters subject to the tie's influence _ and not only landunder navigable waters.   The ebb and flow of the tide, not navigability, determines thestate's ownership, said Justice Byron R. White for the court.   ``States have interests in lands beneath tidal waters which havenothing to do with navigation,'' White said. Those interests rangefrom protecting fishing to setting aside submerged land forreclamation for urban expansion, he said.   ``It would be odd to acknowledge such diverse uses of publictrust tidelands and then suggest that the sole measure of theexpanse of such lands is the navigability of the waters overthem,'' White said.   The court rejected an appeal by private landowners and companiesthat included Phillips Petroleum and a partnership called CinqueBambini.   They challenged the state's claim to some 2,400 acres ofundeveloped property in Hancock County, Miss.   The Mississippi Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that the state hascontrol over the land based on a grant from the federal governmentwhen Mississippi became a state in 1817.   The private landowners and companies based their claims onSpanish land grants of 1813.   The state leased 600 acres of the land to Saga Petroleum U.S.Inc. in 1977 for oil and gas exploration.   The Mississippi court said the state's title extends to all landsubject to tidal influence, inland to the mean high water mark.   The lands in question underly non-navigable bayous and streamsseveral miles north of the Gulf Coast. They are influenced by thetide since they are affected by the ebb and flow of an adjacentnavigable river that flows into the gulf.   Dissenting today were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, John PaulStevens and Antonin Scalia.   O'Connor, writing for the three, said today's ruling will break``a chain of title that reaches back more than 150 years'' and``will disrupt the settled expectations of landowners not only inMississippi but every coastal state.''   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court on Thursday,did not take part in the decision.   The case is Phillips Petroleum vs. Mississippi, 86-870.</TEXT></DOC>
