A determination of final approval was madeunder section 18(e) of the Act on June 27, 1985 (50 FR 28770). Part 1953of this chapter provides procedures for the review and approval of Stateplan change supplements by the Assistant Secretary of Labor for OccupationalSafety and Health (hereinafter referred to as the Assistant Secretary).<ITAG tagnum="84">Description of Supplements</ITAG>Wyoming Occupational Health and Safety ActThe State submitted a State plan change supplement concerning amendmentsto its Occupational Health and Safety Act (Laws 1983, Ch. 172) in April1984. The amendments to the Wyoming Act are as follows: modifying the powersand duties of the Occupational Health and Safety Commission; abolishingthe power of the review board and the Commission to hear contested casesand providing for an independent hearing officer; providing a procedurefor hearings and appeals whereby the Commission makes final administrativedecisions in contested cases and the party adversely affected may appealto the District Court in the county where the violation allegedly occurred;providing for enforcement of the commission's decisions; requiring writtennotification to employers of their right to refuse entry; creating theDepartment of Occupational Health and Safety; and, making penalties forposting violations discretionary.The amendment to the State law which clarifies that penalties for postingviolations are discretionary differs from the Federal law in that the Federallaw provides mandatory penalties for posting violations. However, the State'sguidelines on exercising discretion in proposing penalties for postingviolations, as set forth in the Wyoming Operations Manual, require mandatorypenalties to be calculated and assessed for the same categories of postingviolations as are required pursuant to OSHA policy and procedures. ThisState provision is being approved subject to continued monitoring and ifmonitoring reveals less effective application of penalties for postingviolations, the State will be required to seek a legislative change.Wyoming Rules of Practice and ProcedureThe State submitted amendments to its Rules of Practice and Procedure (Laws1969, ch. 199, 1.) on May 17, 1983, and subsequent revisions on October27, 1983, December 13, 1983, and May 22, 1984. The Rules of Practice andProcedure (change 1) were revised because of changes made to the WyomingOccupational Health and Safety Act in the areas of contested cases, hearings,discrimination, petitions for modification of abatement, and other technicalchanges. The amendments are as follows:(1) Chapters I_Introduction, II_Safety Rules and Regulations and III_Variances,have been revised to make them consistent with technical statutory changesmade in the Act such as: statutory recodification; clarification of definitionsfor deminimis violation and party; changing terminology (``failure to abate''to ``failure to correct''); changing ``Assistant Administrator'' to ``Department''to more appropriately assign the responsibility for research to the Departmentof Occupational Health and Safety rather than a position; and, clarifyingthe requirements for temporary and permanent variances.(2) Chapter IV_Enforcement, Sections 2.h.(1) through (3) and 2M. and N.,have been revised to clarify the Administrator's authority to approve petitionsfor modification of abatement. A new section was added providing affectedemployers, and employees or employee representatives who have filed objections,the right to contest the decision of the Chairman.(3) Chapter IV_Enforcement, Section 4.a.(5), has been revised to eliminatethe Review Board and to provide for a hearing officer to hear contestedcases. The hearing officer recommends a decision to the Commission fora final administrative decision.(4) Chapter IV_Enforcement, Section 7.b.(1)(c), has been revised to clarifythe Agency's procedure for processing allegations of discrimination, includingcompensation for the employees for actual harm suffered as a result ofdiscrimination and the Administrator's responsibility to issue a noticeof violation when discrimination is found.(5) Chapter IX_Hearings has been revised to clarify the Agency's burdenof proof in contested cases by stating that ``The Department shall havethe burden of proof in all cases in which Department action is contested''and ``the employer shall have the burden to produce evidence of any affirmativedefense it may have to any Department action''; to extend authority forall types of hearings allowed by the Act; and, to make the sections consistentwith other technical statutory changes made to its Occupational Healthand Safety Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Location of Plan Supplement for Inspection and Copying</ITAG>A copy of the plan and its supplements may be inspected and copied duringnormal business hours at the following locations: Office of the RegionalAdministrator, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Room 1554,Federal Building, 1961 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado 80202; Wyoming Departmentof Occupational Health and Safety, 604 East 25 Street, Cheyenne, Wyoming82002; and the OSHA Office of the Director of Federal-State Operations,Room N3700, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation</ITAG>Under andSection; 1953.2(c) of this chapter the Assistant Secretary may prescribealternative procedures to expedite the review process or for any othergood cause which may be consistent with law. The Assistant Secretary findsthat the State amendments to its Occupational Health and Safety Act andto its Rules of Practice and Procedure were adopted in accordance withprocedural requirements of State law, which included the opportunity forpublic participation. Good cause is therefore found for approval of thissupplement and further public participation would be unnecessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">Decision</ITAG>After careful consideration and extensive review by the Regional and NationalOffices, the Wyoming plan supplements described above are found to be atleast as effective as comparable Federal provisions and are hereby approvedunder Part 1953 of this chapter. However, the amendment to the State lawwhich clarifies that penalties for posting violations are discretionaryis approved subject to continued monitoring and if monitoring reveals lesseffective application of penalties for posting violations, the State willbe required to seek a legislative change.
