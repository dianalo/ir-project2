JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The massive oil spill that threatens waterfowland fish off the Alaska coast is expected to give ammunition toenvironmentalists fighting to keep oil developers out of a pristinearctic wildlife refuge.   Congress must approve oil exploration in the Arctic NationalWildlife Refuge in northeastern Alaska where the petroleum industrybelieves much oil is hidden.   President Bush endorsed oil drilling along a 1.5 million acrecoastal strip of the refuge if it can be done within environmentalguidelines, and legislation allowing exploration passed a Senatecommittee earlier this month.   But aides for senators on both sides of the issue suggestedMonday that the momentum is likely to slow considerably in light ofthe accident involving the tanker Exxon Valdez and the oil spill inthe environmentally sensitive Prince William Sound.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked Monday about suchspeculation, said that ``at this point, we would not try to makeany sweeping judgments based on the oil spill, certainly not policyjudgments.''   With more than 10 million gallons of oil flowing into the sound,it is the worst oil spill in U.S. history and threatens waterfowl,fish, sea otter and other wildlife as well as the Alaska fishingindustry.   The Exxon oil tanker that ran aground was carrying petroleumwhich had been shipped from Alaska's North Slope through thetrans-Alaska pipeline to Valdez and then put aboard the tanker. Thecontroversy over drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refugeinvolves a coastal plain just east of the North Slope oil fields.   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the Senate environmentalprotection subcommittee, said Monday the spill puts into questionthe oil industry's assurances that they can protect the environment.   ``The oil and gas industries have been very willing to provideassurances that the (arctic refuge) will be developed in anenvironmentally responsible manner,'' said Baucus. ``Unfortunatelythe oil spill ... is the latest and most tragic evidence of the gapthat exists between past industry assurances and actual industryperformance in preventing environmental damage.''   Environmental groups also suggested the accident raisesquestions whether there can be oil development and still guaranteeenvironmental protection as Bush has suggested in his support ofdrilling in the refuge.   ``This (spill) ought to make Congress and President Bushintensely aware that when you have development you're going to haveenvironmental consequences. Period. It's a reality,'' said SydButler, a vice president for the Wilderness Society, which has beenlobbying intensely against opening the arctic refuge for drilling.   David Gardner, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, noted reportsthat the Exxon tanker was being handled by a crewman who did nothave proper credentials when it ran aground, and suggested theepisode ``calls into question'' how much priority the oil industryputs on environmental concerns.   ``It's pretty clear this kind of disaster is going to happen anytime you have oil development and oil production,'' said Gardner.   The American Petroleum Institute, in a statement, called thetanker spill ``a very regrettable situation'' and acknowledged itmay have an impact on pending petroleum legislation, including thequestion of drilling in the arctic refuge.   But Earl Ross, chief spokesman for the industry lobbying group,said it was ``really much too soon to tell what the reaction isgoing to be.''   Ever since the petroleum industry discovered the possiblity oflarge oil and gas deposits under the tundra of the northeasternAlaska refuge, there has been pressure to open the refuge's coastalstrip for exploratory drilling. Some estimates are that it couldproduce as much as 3.2 billion barrels of oil and keep the Alaskapipeline flowing well after North Slope oil is gone.   But the refuge also is the breeding ground for North America'slargest remaining herd of migratory caribou and the habitat forpolar bears, musk oxen, wolves, arctic foxes and an assortment ofwaterfowl. A recent congressional study suggested that oildevelopment in the refuge would produce about the sameenvironmental disruption as has occurred in the North Slope fields.   Legislation allowing drilling in the refuge cleared the SenateEnergy and Natural Resources Committee on March 16, but likely willbe debated in the environmental committee before any floor action.Meanwhile, bills also have been introduced to declare the refuge aformal wilderness area, which would prohibit oil or gas development.</TEXT></DOC>
