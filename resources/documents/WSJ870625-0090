Joy Manufacturing said remaining shareholders will receive for each common share 1.75 shares of exchangeable redeemable preferred stock issued by Joy Technologies.    Joy Manufacturing is a producer of capital equipment and associated services for coal mining, air-pollution control, air compression, ore processing and general industrial applications.
