NO/sub x/ and SO/sub 2/ emissions are thought to be responsiblefor acid rain deposition and the related environmental impacts. Coalfired steam electric units contribute to the NO/sub x/ and SO/sub 2/emission inventory and have been targeted for retrofit control by draftlegislation, especially the units erected prior to the promulgation ofthe New Source Performance Standards (pre-NSPS). A field test projecthas been initiated as part of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) CleanCoal Technology Program to demonstrate GR-SI on three pre-NSPS coal firedboilers in the State of Illinois. The Gas A dry calcium based sorbentcan be injected into the burnout zone where it reacts with SO/sub 2/to form calcium sulfate which may be recovered in the particulate controldevice (typically an electrostatic precipitator). Alternatively, thesorbent may be injected further downstream in the boiler, or in the fluegas duct upstream of the precipitator. The demonstration project involvesthree phases: design, construction and field evaluation. The design phaseis now in progress. In the construction phase, the GR-SI systems willbe retrofitted to steam electric units and in the field evaluation phase,one year tests will be conducted on each unit demonstrating emissioncontrol, performance improvement, environmental effects and cost effectiveness.</TEXT></DOC>
