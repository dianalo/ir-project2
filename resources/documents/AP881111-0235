(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In small towns across America, fall Fridaynights are traditionally reserved for football fever. But in aremote, rural corner of Mississippi, two gridirons are knee-deep inpale, yellowing grass.   No bands have strutted, no cheerleaders have cheered, no burlyhelmeted youths have raced up and down bright stripes of green andwhite this autumn. The 1988 Liberty High Bobcats and Gloster HighHornets never took the field.   Angry black parents, protesting appointment of a white principalat Gloster High School, all but shut the county school systemearlier this fall, ending the season before it even began.   The boycott was especially effective because in Amite County,population 12,000, blacks comprise 80 percent of public schoolstudents. Most white families, as in other Southern states, sendtheir kids to private ``segregation academies.'' Indeed, part of theobjection to the new principal is that he sends his children to anall-white private school.   ``Those white schools are having their football season and it'ssad, especially for the children, that we aren't having ours,''Clarence McDowell, Liberty's principal, said recently as he surveyedthe forlorn football field and delapidated pile of wooden bleacherseuphemistically known as Bobcat Stadium.   McDowell, a short, soft-spoken man, stared silently at the fieldfor another moment and added, ``The school superintendent canceledfootball here at Liberty and over at Gloster High because of theboycotts. It didn't have to happen, but neither side would give.''   The two sides in question are the Amite County School System,headed by superintendent Maurice Foreman, and The Concerned Citizensfor Better Education Committee, a group of black parents led by J.C.Patterson, whose two children and three stepchildren attend publicschools in Liberty.   The Concerned Citizens coalesced after Foreman announced thatRobbie Robertson, the white assistant principal at Gloster High,would succeed Gloster's retiring black principal this fall.Robertson's children attend a private, all-white academy just overthe line in neighboring Wilkinson County.   ``It's bad enough that they passed over qualified blackapplicants to hire him,'' said Patterson, a 39-year-old farmer andconstruction worker. ``But we just aren't going to allow them topush us out and put in a man who thinks his children are too good toattend public schools.''   The citizens committee initially staged a two-week boycottagainst the white merchants of Gloster and Liberty, populations1,200 and 700.   Liberty Mayor Gerald Miller acknowledged the boycotts hurtbusiness. ``The economic conditions around here are not that great.We're dependent upon oil and timber, so we need everybody to ptichin and support the county,'' he said.   When classes began Aug. 27, the boycott shifted to the county'sfour public schools, two elementary and two high schools. Blackchildren were taught in makeshift classroooms set up in churches.   Gloster High, with 350 students, was completely shut down. AtLiberty, with an enrollment of 600, only 50 students, mostly whites,attended class.   ``We called off the boycott at the beginning of October, afterthe Justice Department agreed to investigate,'' Patterson said.``Right now, we're waiting to see what happens.'' Investigators havevisited several times but Justice has yet to release a report ormake recommendations.   Patterson said Robertson's ouster is not the group's only demand.The parents also want better courses, more black administrators, newschoolbooks and improved facilities.   ``The books are a crime,'' Patterson said. ``Many of them areoutdated and were discards from other counties.'' He said LibertyHigh was ``a dump and a rat trap.''   This fall's walkout was the second major school boycott in AmiteCounty.   In 1977, after the first boycott, the system was placed underfederal court order to cease segregating students by sex and tofollow various racial guidelines, one being that there would be atleast two black principals.   ``But the order was dropped in 1984 (after school officials saidthey'd met guidelines) and the schools have gone downhill eversince,'' Patterson asserted. ``Now, of the 10 administrators in thecounty system, only one, Clarence McDowell, is black. And he'sthinking about retiring because he gets no support from MauriceForeman, the white superintendent.   ``Then, too,'' he added, ``Foreman keeps hiring white teachers,including people who send their children to private schools. And, ontop of that, our children's test scores have been dropping everyyear.''   Foreman acknowledged Patterson's claims but said he'd hired whiteteachers to try to attract white students. ``But even with thesehirings, whites still make up only 33 percent of the employees inour school system,'' he said. He said more than 60 percent of AmiteCounty teachers are black.   Foreman, who is elected, also admitted high school test scoresare weak. ``It's true that we're way below the national (ACT)average,'' he said, and 20 percent of the 11th graders failed thestate literacy test last year. But he blamed what he called ``theprivate school crowd.''   ``This was last county in America to operate a public schoolsystem that had boys and girls going to separate schools,'' he said.``We lost a lot of whites in 1970, when we had to integrate, andlost a lot more in 1977, when we were ordered to drop the separatesexes plan installed in 1971.   ``Until recently,'' he said, ``the county Board of Supervisorswas dominated by the private school crowd; they wouldn't give meanything but the bare minimum (tax) millage to run the schools.''   Since the law governing control of county budgets was changed twoyears ago, he said funding has improved.   ``We're starting to make progress,'' he said. ``We've got a newvo-tech school and our elementary schools are in good shape. What weneed now is a new, consolidated high school. ... It doesn't makegood sense to operate two small high schools 20 miles apart.''   The dispute has stirred racial feelings, but neither sidewelcomed a march through Liberty by a band of white supremacists onOct. 15. Their leader, Nationalist Movement founder Richard Barrettof Jackson, said they supported Robbie Robertson. Robertson,however, said he wanted no such champions.   ``I didn't ask for their support,'' he said. ``I don't know themand I want nothing to do with them.''   In an interview in his high school office, Robertson acknowledgedthe problems caused when he was chosen from among three black andfour white candidates.   ``This puts me in an uncomfortable position,'' Robertson said.``The blacks didn't want a white principal. It made them mad when Iwas appointed, and then they used the fact that I send my childrento private schools as an excuse to stage their boycotts.''   When asked why he chose not to patronize the public schools, hereplied, ``I just don't care to say.''   Robertson said he'd experienced much less friction at school fromstudents than he had expected. Patterson, however, said about 100students _ almost a third of Gloster's enrollment _ had transferredafter the boycott to Liberty High, where McDowell is the county'ssole black principal.   Meanwhile, there is little joy in Amite County on Friday nights.   ``We should be getting ready for our big game with Gloster, ourarch rival,'' McDowell said. ``But there'll be nothing but rabbitsand wild turkeys on the field that night and it hurts.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs, Nov. 16</NOTE></DOC>
