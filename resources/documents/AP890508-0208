REID</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The recent killing of an Americancolonel reflects a shift in strategy by Filipino Communist rebelsseeking to reverse setbacks suffered since President Corazon Aquinotook power three years ago.   As part of the shift, the Communist Party of the Philippines isreverting back to a rural-based strategy after the failure of anurban campaign and is becoming more selective in recruiting aftermilitary agents infiltrated its ranks.   The rebels are also focusing on American influence, especiallythe presence of six U.S. military installations, in a bid to gainsupport in urban areas, where opposition to the bases is strongest.The rebels have offered peace talks if the government agrees toclose the bases.   They also took responsibility for the April 21 assassination ofCol. James N. Rowe of the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group. Arebel statement said the colonel was slain because of Americaninterference here.   Assessing the strength of the rebellion is difficult, since mostactivity takes place in remote areas where communications are poor.Much of the information on rebel activity comes from the163,000-member Armed Forces of the Philippines.   ``Today at the national level, the insurgents appear to be onthe defensive and attempting to regroup,'' Rear Adm. Timothy W.Wright, acting U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense, told aU.S. congressional committee recently.   ``In the provinces, however, where the struggle is primarilywaged, the picture is less clear because much of the insurgents'grassroots program is not conducted on the military battlefield.''   Nonetheless, there is a public perception, especially in Manila,that the insurgency has weakened since a popular uprising toppledPresident Ferdinand Marcos' authoritarian administration inFebruary 1986.   Rebel propaganda portrays Mrs. Aquino as no different fromMarcos. But most Filipinos still support her and do not blame herpersonally for the shortcomings of her government.   ``Without going into statistics, there is a feeling in thepopulation that the insurgency is in disarray,'' military Chief ofStaff Gen. Renato de Villa said in an interview with thePhilippines Free Press magazine. ``I think the most importantdevelopment is the realization that is spreading that the insurgentalternative is not that palatable.''   That perception has arisen despite military reports thatfighting actually escalated in 1988. Military reports show thenumber of clashes rose from 3,118 in 1987 to 3,525 last year.   Areas reporting increased fighting include southern districts ofLuzon, the main island, and the Davao and Misamis Orientalprovinces on Mindanao.   According to the military, more than 3,900 people, includingguerrillas, government troopers and civilians were killed last yearin ``insurgency-related incidents,'' a 1.63 percent increase over1987.   The military also acknowledges that guerrillas influence nearly8,000 of the 41,000 villages and urban wards. Rebels operate inabout 65 of the 73 provinces.   But the military also claims guerrilla strength declined by 8.4percent last year to about 23,000 fighters. Western sources, whospoke on condition of anonymity, suspect this may be simply arefinement in the military's estimate, which was too high in thefinal years of the Marcos administration.   De Villa says captured rebel documents indicate demoralizationin the ranks due to a 21 percent increase in battlefield deathsduring the first three months of this year. Military officialsbelieve Rowe was killed in part to boost morale in rebel ranks.   Wright noted the favorable military reports but said there wasno way to verify them ``nor are they conclusive of a significant orlasting setback'' to the rebels.   Clearly, however, the party has suffered reverses. They includethe arrests in the past year of eight members of its centralcommittee, including Secretary General Rafael Baylosis, and morethan 30 regional and provincial officers.   Western sources with close ties to the military say the arrestswere made because government informants penetrated senior partyranks during the final years of the Marcos administration whenmembership rolls swelled.   Despite rebel attempts to win foreign support, both SovietForeign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Chinese leader DengXiaoping have personally assured Mrs. Aquino that they will notsupport the insurgents. The rebels acknowledge their main source ofweapons comes from raids on government forces.   The perception that the insurgency is waning may stem in partfrom a reduction in rebel and left-wing activity in the capital,which peaked in the months following Marcos' ouster and the rise ofMrs. Aquino to power.   Since the party was founded in December 1968, it had followedthe strategy of late Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung in building a basein the impoverished rural areas from which to isolate the urbancenters.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
