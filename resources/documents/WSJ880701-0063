They're still waiting.    Although turnover in New York's residential market stopped dead after the Oct. 19 stock market crash, sales activity has picked up in recent months. The most expensive cooperatives and condominiums -- generally large apartments in prewar buildings -- are selling at slightly higher prices than before the crash. Prices of units in new buildings, which were softening before the crash, have continued to ease.    Why hasn't there been a crack in the market, despite the crash and all the layoffs on Wall Street? One reason is that many of those dismissed were lower-level workers who didn't own Manhattan real estate. Also, &quot;there is a lot of money out there that wasn't Wall Street money,&quot; says Esther Kaplan, an official at Corcoran Group, a Manhattan broker. Of course, if Wall Street endures a lengthy slump, brokers say, realestate prices could follow suit.    The Boston-area condominium market, for years one of the hottest in the country, has finally cooled off. Brokers and developers say the main reasons are overbuilding and tax overhaul's elimination of many tax benefits of owning rental properties.    Prices around Boston rose 30% annually for several years, fueling development. Now the market is glutted, and prices this year are flat. Sales are so slow that developers are offering free vacations and other incentives.    Mortgage-Fee Proposal   By HUD Stirs Debate   SHOULD real-estate brokers be allowed to receive a fee for referring consumers to mortgage lenders?    The 1974 Real Estate Settlement Procedure Act barred direct payments from lenders to brokers -- a response to charges that brokers were steering consumers to loans that weren't always the cheapest. But now the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which enforces the statute, has proposed allowing fee programs in which consumers would pay brokers for access to special lender services.    Since 1986, HUD has let Citicorp Mortgage Co., a unit of Citicorp, operate a program called MortgagePower, whose special services include quick mortgage decisions based on limited financial data. Brokers pay Citicorp an annual fee of $1,000 to $2,500 for access to the program and then can charge consumers who use it fees ranging from $100 to 0.5% of the loan amount.    HUD now has proposed allowing such programs without case-by-case review. The agency expects the proposal to go to Congress later this summer.    But many lenders say the programs have the same flaw as those banned in 1974: They create an incentive for brokers to steer customers to certain lenders, without regard for the customers' interests.    Further, many lenders fear some lenders and brokers will misinterpret the change and revert to making direct payments to brokers for customer referrals. &quot;Give them an inch and they'll take a mile,&quot; says E. Robert Levy, executive director and counsel for the Mortgage Bankers of New Jersey.    Citicorp defends its program, saying consumers are free to look for loans elsewhere. Supporters of the proposal say brokers should be compensated if they give customers access to extra services. Says Ed Gresham, president and chief executive officer of ERA Real Estate Inc., a national brokerage firm: &quot;There's a lot of concern over nothing.&quot;    Surprising Support   For Development?    THE REJECTION of a &quot;slow-growth&quot; initiative by voters in Orange County, Calif., last month could mark a turning point, pro-development forces say.    Voters, they say, sent a message that more highways and mass transit are a better way to handle overcrowding than limits on development. &quot;The truth is, people aren't as anti-building as people thought,&quot; says John Simon, a lawyer who represents builders and led the fight against the initiative.    Early polls showed that 80% of voters were in favor of the initiative, which would have damped prospects for commercial and residential development. But opponents of the measure, funded by $2 million in builder contributions, blitzed the county with phone calls and literature. Many businesses urged customers and employees to vote against it.    Says Belinda Blacketer, a lawyer who co-authored the measure: &quot;We got outspent about 33 to 1.&quot;    Sanford Goodkin, a real-estate consultant with Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co. in San Diego, says the vote probably strengthened the resolve of both sides. &quot;The nogrowth movement,&quot; he says, &quot;isn't about to go away.&quot; -   Lenders Stress Service   To Attract Customers   WITH BUSINESS down and competition up, mortgage lenders are trying to win customers through faster service.    Closing a loan takes an average of four to six weeks, but some lenders, such as Citicorp Mortgage, have reduced the time to 14 days. Los Angeles-based Great Western Bank, a unit of Great Western Financial Corp., now approves mortgages in 10 to 12 days, down from 21 to 23 days in 1987.    Lenders expect mortgage volume of $325 billion this year, down from $425 billion last year and $450 billion in 1986. As a result, &quot;you're seeing the servicing is a lot better than in 1986 and 1987,&quot; says Gene Crane, a Great Western Bank senior vice president.    Lenders note that the quick approvals are for routine loan applications; complicated cases still would take longer. </TEXT></DOC>
