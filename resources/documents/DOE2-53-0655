When each vapor was desorbed, curves of desorbinggas concentration versus time were obtained. The curves were analyzedto obtain relationships between the adsorption loading of the carbon,the time required for peak desorption to occur, and the actual valueof the peak desorbing concentration for each of the vapors tested.</TEXT></DOC>
