Although the Privacy Act requiresonly that the ``routine uses'' portion of the system be published for comment,HCFA invites comments on all portions of this notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>HCFA filed a new system report with the Chairman of theCommittee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, theChairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and theAdministrator, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB, on March 14, 1989.The new system of records, including routine uses, will become effectiveMay 16, 1989, unless HCFA receives comments which would necessitate alterationto the system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>The public should address comments to Richard A. DeMeo,HCFA Privacy Act Officer, Office of Budget and Administration, Health CareFinancing Administration, Room G-M-1, East Low Rise, 6325 Security Boulevard,Baltimore, Maryland 21207.

In addition,Section 1874 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395kk) (a), (b), providesadditional authority to obtain information needed to administer the Medicareprogram. HCFA has studied and published variations in mortality rates amongMedicare patients admitted to acute care hospitals. These mortality ratescontain diagnosis and procedure codes, but lack the clinical data neededto satisfactorily assess the physiological condition (severity of illness)of the patient on admission. The systems of records of severity of illnessof patients at admission allows HCFA to statistically and scientificallyevaluate the role of adjustment for severity of illness in the estimationof hospital mortality rates. Data in the system will include clinical informationincluding history, pre-admission findings, and findings during the initialperiod of hospitalization, i.e., the first 48 hours following admissionor the pre-operative period if an operation was performed during the first48 hours. This information may then be used to demonstrate better waysto risk-adjust mortality rates for such differences to the extent foundto be necessary. The Privacy Act permits us to disclose information withoutconsent of the individual for ``routine uses''_that is, disclosure forpurposes that are compatible with the purpose for which we collect theinformation. The proposed routine uses in the new system meet the compatibilitycriteria, since the information is collected for the purpose of addressingthe issues of assessing the adequacy of care and linking adverse outcomeswith inadequate care. We anticipate that disclosure under the routine useswill not result in any unwarranted adverse effects on personal privacy.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: March 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Terry Coleman</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Administrator, Heath Care Financing Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="66">09-70-1514</ITAG>System name:HCFA Severity of Illness Data File HHS/HCFA/HSQB.Security Classification: None.system location:Health Care Financing Administration, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore,Maryland 21207, Contact: MediQual Systems, Inc., 1900 West Park Drive,Westborough, MA 01581.categories of individuals covered by the system:A statistically stratified sample of Medicare patient cases selected byHCFA from hospitals nationwide.categories of records in the system:The system contains the first six characters of the individual's last name,health insurance claim number or social security number (SSN), date ofadmission, date of discharge, assigned DRG, clinical information includinghistory, pre-admission findings, and findings during the initial periodof hospitalization, i.e., the first 48 hours following admission or thepre-operative period if an operation was performed during the first 48hours.authority for maintenance of the system:Section 1874 (42 U.S.C. 1395kk) (a), (b), and Section 1875 (42 U.S.C. 139511)(a), as amended by the Social Security Act.Purpose of the System: To obtain clinical data characterizing the severity of illness of patientsupon hospital admission in order to assess its impact upon mortality rates.routine uses of records maintained in the system, including categoriesof users and purposes of such uses:Disclosure may be made to: 1.
