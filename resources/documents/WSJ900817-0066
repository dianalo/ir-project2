But some industryefforts are under way that could gradually replace some ofthe crude from the volatile Middle East in the years ahead --if oil prices remain at or above their current $27-a-barrellevel.   These include developing more, and more reliable, sourcesof domestic and foreign oil, enhanced use of other energysources such as natural gas, and developing advancedtechnological processes. For example, in New Zealand, MobilCorp. has supplied technology to convert natural gas intogasoline, a process that could possibly make natural gas ahead-to-head competitor with oil should oil prices continueto rise.</LP><TEXT>   The government on Wednesday announced an energy plan tocut the nation's foreign oil dependence by as much as 550,000barrels a day by year-end, but experts quickly faulted theplan as insufficient.   The U.S. now imports more than eight million barrels ofoil a day. A record one-half of all oil used to run industry,heat homes and fuel cars comes from foreign sources, andexperts see that figure rising to 75% by the end of thedecade. Just yesterday, statistics released by the AmericanPetroleum Institute showed imports rising by 8.4% in Julyfrom a year ago.   Oil now accounts for 43% of U.S. energy use, and expertsagree this country will never be able to do without foreigncrude supplies. But it doesn't necessarily have to. Theproblem for the '90s and beyond isn't foreign oil per se,experts say; it is the stability and reliability of those whosupply it -- in particular the handful of nations ringing thePersian Gulf, where the richest oil reserves on Earth lie.   Recent events prove that region unreliable, says U.S.Energy Secretary James Watkins. &quot;This is a tough time for us,but perhaps out of this crisis will come a better strategy,&quot;he adds.   The government is counting on its planned effort to getcar tires inflated properly for savings of about 100,000barrels of crude oil daily. Other gains would come largelyfrom enhanced production at domestic wells by some major U.S.oil companies.   The Bush administration is resisting any notion ofmounting a major conservation effort, as officials fearreminding voters of the Carter years, during which PresidentCarter actually donned a sweater when he turned down the heatat the White House. In any event, previous efforts atconservation have proved short-lived.   Higher taxes on gasoline are also considered politicallyimpossible, and atomic energy faces widespread publicopposition. Far-fetched alternatives, ranging from electriccars to windmills, aren't yet economically viable.   Despite the gloomy forecasts, several efforts show somepotential for lessening U.S. dependence on foreign oil.                                                                                                          Domestic Oil Production                                                                                                          The U.S. is still one of the world's largest oilproducers, with an estimated 27.2 billion barrels of reservesin the ground. But that's a far cry from 34.2 billion barrelsreached in 1975 as massive oil fields in Alaska's North Slopewere opening up. No major sources of new oil are on thehorizon, and even if one were found, it would probably takeabout a decade for a new source to begin large-scaleproduction.   Domestic oil production will accelerate somewhat as new,higher prices justify the very high cost of extracting moreoil from existing wells. Generally, oil producers set abenchmark of $25 a barrel, or around the current price, tojustify the cost of technology needed to extract theadditional oil. Oil men say that less-expensive, routineprocesses leave two-thirds of each potential barrel of oilbehind.   In the past week, Chevron Corp. ordered a $100 millionincrease in domestic spending this year, which it said will&quot;in a very short time increase the amount of oil flowing fromexisting fields.&quot;   But this doesn't have the potential to increase U.S.output radically. More potential lies in areas not yetdrilled or currently off-limits to oil companies. Aconsortium led by Chevron is ready to pump up to 100,000barrels a day from three new platforms built in a $2.5billion oil-drilling project off Santa Barbara, Calif. Butthe group can't operate because necessary pipeline and tankerpermits have been denied on environmental grounds by localand state authorities. The Bush administration said earlierthis week it will try to mediate this dispute.   Major new oil reserves also may lie hidden under thetundra in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. To thedismay of some both inside and outside the oil industry,however, exploration there was blocked in the aftermath ofthe Exxon Valdez oil spill. &quot;We're willing to risk lives inthe Persian Gulf, but not the lives of caribou in Alaska,&quot;complains Henry Schuler, an energy security specialist withthe Center for Strategic International Studies in Washington,D.C.                                                                                                          More Foreign Oil                                                                                                          No one is seriously suggesting all foreign oil could beavoided; the country has been importing vast amounts fordecades and will almost certainly import more from here on,regardless of domestic gains. But now many oil executives areevaluating non-traditional foreign suppliers, and a leadingcandidate is the Soviet Union.   It is already the largest oil producer in the world,pumping about 12 million barrels a day, far more than thepresent output of Saudi Arabia. But its exports, which havegenerally gone to Eastern Europe, are dwindling; Soviet oilmen have encountered production problems that have cut totaloutput in each of the past two years. Now, the Soviet Unionis seeking help to redevelop its industry. That, togetherwith its markedly changed international political role, ischeering some international oil companies.   Not long ago, some Soviet oil men visited Houston tosolicit U.S. oil-service companies' help in developing theirfields. Others recently were at Texaco headquarters in WhitePlains, N.Y., where an exploration pact was struck four daysago. Elf-Aquitaine, the big French company with strong U.S.ties, has agreed to explore one potential Soviet field, andChevron is talking with Soviets about another.   But hopeful U.S. oil men had better &quot;be long on patienceand on time,&quot; says Marshall Goldman, a Soviet expert withHarvard University. Although the huge country is rich inenergy resources -- it has, for instance, 45% of the world'snatural gas reserves -- it lacks the procedural arrangementsnecessary to produce and market them efficiently. The systemfor extracting resources sometimes lapses into near anarchy.Despite directives from Moscow, coal miners in the Ukraine inrecent weeks sold some of the coal they were mining directlyto Japanese traders in exchange for Nissan cars they coveted.   In addition, limited amounts of petroleum may be obtainedin the future from obscure oil-producing countries previouslyignored as too small to matter. Vietnam now is producing50,000 barrels a day of Bach Ho Crude with the help offoreign investors and is aiming for 200,000 barrels daily intwo years. Oil industry people also mention Moroccan andBrazilian oil.                                                                                                          Natural Gas                                                                                                          On paper, at least, no resource offers better hope ofreducing oil use than natural gas. Gas also burns cleaner,giving it environmental advantages, and it's a more easilytapped resource than oil.   Technically, it is easy for utilities and manufacturingbusinesses to change the fuel they burn from oil to gas. Manyof these facilities are already capable of fuel-switching andexercise that ability when gas prices are more attractivethan oil. Natural gas can even be used in cars, after certainengine modifications and the addition of a compressed-gasstorage tank.   A big problem, however, is that natural gas is much moredifficult to transport and store than oil. In response to thecurrent oil crisis, the government is working on ways tosimplify transportation at least, in hopes of encouragingenough additional substitution to replace 160,000 barrels ofoil a day.   If oil prices rise far enough, however, the technologydeveloped by Mobil to turn natural gas directly into gasolinecould become a significant option. The catalyst, found by thecompany's researchers 10 years ago, &quot;is magical stuff,&quot; aMobil official says.   The alchemy becomes cheaper than standard refiningprocesses for gasoline after oil hits $36 a barrel, someindustry officials believe. So for now, only one plant in theworld is fitted out to do this. Built in New Zealand in 1985,it puts out 15,000 barrels a day of gasoline, supplyingone-third of that nation's needs.   If oil prices go up substantially, &quot;who knows&quot; what thepossibilities are, the Mobil official says.   Some 4,000 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves lie underthe earth in the U.S., Canada and many other countries,making gas reserves more plentiful than oil reserves. TheSoviet Union alone has as much untapped natural gas as SaudiArabia has in equivalent oil reserves, one expert says. Inthe U.S., gas reserves are 165 trillion cubic feet.   In the past, oil companies searched for oil, and weredismayed if they found only gas. But that's changing.Already, Amoco Corp. is more of a gas producer than an oilproducer.                                                                                                          Conservation                                                                                                          Conservation has flagged since oil prices crashed in themid-1980s, but built-in efficiencies such as more homeinsulation and fuel-efficient cars remain.   More gains can be realized. While experts are reluctant tomake exact predictions, they say that historically, a 10%rise in fuel prices causes a 2% decrease in consumption. Oilprices have risen more than 27% since Iraq's invasion ofKuwait.   &quot;We have the potential to save a lot of energy overnightby simply altering behavioral responses; we estimate that asmuch as 30% of the energy decline following the last crisiswas attributable to people changing their habits,&quot; saysJoseph Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge EnergyResearch Associates.   For instance, motorists are driving an average of 1,000miles a year more now than in 1980. And they're doing it incars that in the past two years have gotten 7% heavier, 10%more powerful and half a mile per gallon less fuel-efficient.This alone is using an added 200,000 barrels of oil a day.   Another form of conservation is cogeneration, or theprocess in which some industrial plants can generateelectricity at the same time they are burning a fuel such ascoal, gas or oil. The plants then generally sell thiselectricity to utility companies.   Less than 5% of electricity is produced throughcogeneration, but its use is growing. Theoretically,cogeneration should conserve energy because it makes atwofold use of one energy source. But in practice thatdoesn't necessarily happen. Cogeneration can consume more oiland gas, contends Michael Gluckman, technical director ofElectric Power Research Institute, because many cogenerationplants run on those fuels, and the power they produce oftenreplaces power from utility plants that burn coal.                                                                                                          Coal                                                                                                          Coal supplies in the U.S. are huge. Using technologyavailable today, 268 billion tons are recoverable. That'senough at current consumption rates to last almost threecenturies.   Unfortunately, opportunities to replace oil with coal overthe near-term aren't plentiful. For one thing, tighteningenvironmental restrictions are making it more difficult touse coal, a dirtier-burning fuel than either oil or gas. Andfollowing the energy crises of the '70s, many utilities andmanufacturing plants have already converted to coal.   Today, 57% of the nation's electricity needs are suppliedby coal. Oil ranks behind nuclear, natural gas and hydropower, controlling less than 5% of the utility market.   Unless crude-oil prices stay above $25 a barrel for aprotracted period or severe supply disruptions occur, thereprobably will be little incentive for facilities still usingoil to switch to coal. &quot;It would take a year of high oilprices,&quot; says Daniel Gerkin, a senior vice president of theNational Coal Association.   Although oil is the fuel of choice in the transportationsector, there has been some experimentation with coal. A coaland oil slurry has potential as a fuel for barges andrailroads. And in South Africa, where oil for politicalreasons has been embargoed for years, gasoline is made fromcoal. But Mr. Gerkin points out that the government theresubsidizes that production. Gasoline from coal wouldn't beeconomic in the U.S. unless oil prices increased to well over$35 a barrel.                                                                                                          Unconventional Fuels   Crude oil made from tar sands is one of the most promisingalternative fuels. Oil-laden earth is currently being turnedinto 60,000 barrels of high-quality synthetic crude a day inthe northern reaches of Alberta, Canada, by Suncor Inc., aunit of Sun Co. of Philadelphia. Five miles down the road,Syncrude Canada Ltd., partly owned by Imperial Oil, anExxon-controlled Canadian company, has production three timesthat of Suncor.   The sands are essentially mined, with a giant bucket-wheelripping tons of the tarry earth from mountainsides. The earthis then processed into crude that in turn is refined intomotor fuel or heating oil.   Suncor officials admit that it takes oil prices of atleast $25 a barrel to make their process commercially viable.But an estimated 300 billion barrels of recoverable oil liesunder the giant Athabasca tar sands. So Suncor, which hasmanufactured its synthetic oil there since 1967, believes itwill realize &quot;an adequate return&quot; over the long term.   Venezuela creates a slightly different product, asuper-heavy crude, from its Orinoco Belt. The material is sodense that without the addition of water, it's almostimpossible to transport. But currently 15,000 barrels a dayof this gunk is being turned into a slurry and exported. OPECdoesn't even count it against Venezuela's oil-output quota,though by 1995 Venezuela could be producing by some estimates400,000 barrels a day of this oil. Germany and the U.K.import some of the viscous product, and a utility in downtownLondon burns it without further processing.   Synthetic fuels still must live down past failures.Creation of an entire $88 billion synthetic fuels industry,as tried by the Carter administration, should never have beenattempted, says John Sawhill, the former deputy energysecretary who headed up the project. &quot;Synfuels Corp. was justtoo big. We were required to spend too much money tooquickly,&quot; he says.   Of 150 proposals examined, only a handful ever gotstarted. The largest of those were coal gasification andoil-shale extraction projects. None would be commerciallyfeasible if constructed today. Some of the oil-shale plantswere particularly troublesome; at one built by Unocal Corp.in Parachute Creek, Colo., systems became so gummed withshale waste that jackhammers were needed to clean them out.Moreover, by today's environmental standards, shale plantswould be highly undesirable.   The first project funded by Synfuels, a coal gasificationplant in Southern California that turns coal into gas, seemsto have been one of the more beneficial. Until its recentclosure, it was providing enough power to a nearby electricgrid to light 100,000 homes in Los Angeles. Texaco recentlypurchased it and will put it back into operation by 1992. Butthen it will be used to burn coal and sewage sludge from LosAngeles.   ---                   Hooked on Imported Oil                                                                                                          1989 U.S. energy consumption by source, in percent   Oil                                    43.0%   Natural Gas                            22.0%   Coal                                   22.0%   Nuclear                                 6.0%   Renewables                              4.0%   Hydro                                   3.0%                                                                                                          Source: Chevron Corp.   ---   U.S. imports of crude oil and products by country oforigin, 1990 year-to-date through May, as a percent                                                                                                          Other                                  19.86%   Saudi Arabia                           14.98%   Venezuela                              11.96%   Nigeria                                11.23%   Canada                                 10.97%   Mexico                                  8.53%   Iraq                                    7.28%   Algeria                                 3.54%   Angola                                  3.38%   Britain                                 2.86%   Colombia                                2.32%   Indonesia                               1.65%   Kuwait                                  1.44%                                                                                                          Source: Energy Information Administration</TEXT></DOC>
