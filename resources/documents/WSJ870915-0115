In fact, they had been borrowed almost word for word from a campaign speech by Neil Kinnock.    Neil Kinnock: &quot;Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get into a university?&quot;    Joe Biden: &quot;Why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university?&quot; And so on.    Now we suppose it's to some extent true that politicians are the same everywhere, but it takes more than the usual amount of political chutzpah to rework the ancient theme of British class warfare for a U.S. election. &quot;He was not trying to put something over,&quot; one adviser says. &quot;He's under a huge amount of pressure. He didn't even know what he said. He was just on automatic pilot.&quot;    Just as The Gary Hartpence name-change revelation was the first hint of front-runner Gary Hart's collapse in 1984, the Biden plagiarism episode is a clue to the character of a presidential contender. Today Senator Biden will start the exploration into the Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork, chairing hearings that will be watched by millions of Americans. Viewers should know that there is much in the record to suggest he spends a lot more time on automatic pilot.    When Judge Bork's name surfaced in this context last November, Senator Biden told the Philadelphia Inquirer that if Judge Bork proved to be qualified, &quot;I'd have to vote for him.&quot; Now Senator Biden justifies his opposition to Judge Bork by saying the Senate's role in giving &quot;advice and consent&quot; for judicial nominees meant that &quot;the framers intended the Senate to take the broadest possible view of its constitutional responsibility,&quot; including the duty to examine a nominee's &quot;political, legal and constitutional views.&quot;    On this issue Senator Biden is at war with himself. During an earlier debate over Jimmy Carter's nomination of Rep. Abner Mikva to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Senator Biden seemed to be reading from a different Constitution. &quot;I think that the advice and consent responsibility of the Senate does not permit us to deprive the president of the United States from being able to appoint that person or persons who have a particular point of view unless it can be shown that their temperament does not fit the job, that they are morally incapable or unqualified for the job, or that they have committed crimes of moral turpitude,&quot; he said during Judiciary Committee hearings on July 12, 1979.    Rep. Mikva, like Judge Bork, was a controversial nominee. His near-perfect liberal voting record included support for gun control and quotas. Senator Biden argued that his belief that a nominee's views shouldn't affect how senators vote was mandated by the Constitution itself: &quot;I do not think that under the Constitution I have a right to say I will not vote for someone to be on the Supreme Court or secretary of Treasury because I disagree with the view that he holds on a particular issue.&quot;    Possibly all these views will be clarified over the coming days. </TEXT></DOC>
