The ministers met for about 90 minutes before putting off theirformal talks until Wednesday.   President Rilwanu Lukman opened the winter meeting of the13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries by appealingfor compromise. He said cartel members must reach a new accordlimiting their oil production or risk a ``serious erosion'' of crudeprices.   ``It may be necessary to take one step back now from ourdeep-seated principles and beliefs in order to take two stepsforward at a later date,'' he said.   He said the cartel's problems ``are formidable and yet they arenot insuperable.''   Crude oil prices edged higher on the New York Mercantile Exchangein light trading as the market awaited definitive news on theprogress of the talks. Contracts for January delivery of West TexasIntermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose 7 cents from Friday'sclose to settle at $12.98 cents per 42-gallon barrel.   Lukman said they had not yet discussed the crucial questions ofoil production, output quotas for member countries and pricing.   A few hours after the meeting, the ministers resumed some of theprivate discussions they have been holding since late last week totry to resolve the issues separating Iran and Iraq.   The main obstacle has been Iraq's insistence on a productionceiling equal to Iran.   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh met with his Algeriancounterpart, Sadek Boussena, who appears to have become an emissarybetween Iran and Persian Gulf countries.   After the meeting, Aghazadeh told reporters it was still tooearly to tell whether an agreement would be reached or not.Consultations, he said, will continue Tuesday.   ``If we should (see) some proposal that is good, we accept,'' hesaid.   The ministers want to work out a new arrangement giving eachcountry a production quota. They want to include Iraq in the system.Iraq refused to join in the current accord arranged in 1986.   ``I would be happier if I was inside the agreement,'' said IraqiOil Minister Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi.   Aghazadeh again said he would oppose quota parity with Iraq. Thetwo countries have had different ceilings for some time, he said.   Saudia Arabia and Kuwait have said they will not join a new quotasystem unless all 13 members belong.   The ministers want to use the new accord to cap their runawayproduction and lift weak prices. OPEC maintains a benchmark price of$18 a barrel but prices have been well under that.   Lukman told the ministers, ``As we are all aware, prices havebeen hovering $5 to $6 per barrel below our targeted levels forseveral months now.''   ``If we do not reach such an accord,'' he said, ``then I amafraid we may see a further serious erosion of these price levels,to our mutual detriment.''   Aghazadeh said he has offered to meet with Iraq, Saudi Arabia,Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to work out the quota dispute.   ``We can sit down to solve (the) problem (and have a) discussionabout any matter,'' he said. ``I am very flexible.''   He also said Iran wants OPEC to give it a higher ceiling in anynew agreement. Iran needs more revenues from its oil to help rebuildafter the 8-year war with Iraq.   He said Iran will be able within a year to boost its productionof oil to more than 4 million barrels a day. The country, he said,is currently pumping more than 3 million barrels a day and willboost that to about 3.3 million in a few months.   Under the current production agreement, Iran has a ceiling of 2.4million barrels a day. Iraq, although it refused to join the currentaccord, has an allotment of 1.5 million barrels a day.   Analysts estimate that Iraq has been producing at least 2.6million barrels a day, an amount that could soar to 3.7 millionbarrels in mid-1989 with completion of a new pipeline through SaudiArabia to the Red Sea.   OPEC's current output accord sets total production at about 15million barrels a day for 12 countries.   Total cartel production in October was estimated by theInternational Energy Agency at nearly 21.1 million barrels, thehighest monthly level in more than five years.   Aghazadeh has proposed that Iraq be given ``export parity'' withIran. That would allow Iran to have a higher overall ceiling toaccount for its larger internal oil demand, which it estimates at 1million barrels a day.   A possibility for resolving the dispute, analysts suggested,would be to give Iraq a lower quota on paper. But the difference inthe ceilings would be made up by letting Iraq keep a portion of theoil produced in an area called the neutral zone, which is shared bySaudi Arabia and Kuwait.   The discussions began Thursday evening when the two OPECcommittees _ price evolution and long-term strategy _ held formaltalks.   Countries belonging to those panels are Indonesia, Saudi Arabia,Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Indonesia, Kuwait and Venezuela.   Other members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and the UnitedArab Emirates.</TEXT></DOC>
