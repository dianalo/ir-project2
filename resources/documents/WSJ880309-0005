While there has been speculation for many years that the size and shape of fibers rather than their chemical composition might be the determining factor in lung disease, this never has been proved. To my knowledge there is no solid, much less conclusive, evidence that inhaled fiberglass particles cause lung cancer or any lung disease resembling asbestosis. Incidentally, asbestosis is not lung cancer, and many people who suffer from asbestosis but do not smoke do not develop lung cancer. Smoking and asbestos exposure are synergistic. The combination greatly increases the risk of developing lung cancer.    Richard Munson in an apparent self-serving effort to discredit a competitor's product ignores the fact that there is rather heavy evidence that certain wood dusts (cellulose if you will) can cause cancer of the lung. This is not to say that Mr. Munson's product can or does cause cancer, but he who lives in a glass house should not throw stones. How would he respond to a campaign by some other insulation manufacturer that claimed his product is carcinogenic based on the rather limited studies done on wood dusts?    Too many activists like Mr. Munson deliver dollar opinions based on a nickel's worth of information or fact.    Paul C. Witbeck   Latham, N.Y. </TEXT></DOC>
