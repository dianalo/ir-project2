 This has been truenot only on large contracts but also for purchases of small quantities from adistributor that &quot;owns&quot; a particular brand on the General ServicesAdministration schedules.andM;The specialized distributors catering to the federal market include BohdanAssociates Inc., Government Technology Services Inc. and Falcon MicrosystemsInc.andP;  For these companies, price discounting, in one form or another, mirrorsvery tough market conditions.andM;The federal demand for desktop computers, once seemingly insatiable, nolonger is as robust as the vendors had expected.andP;  The major reasons forslackening demand include heavy shipments in previous years and budgetaryrestraints.andP;  Also, when agencies are required to buy through a designatedcontractor, there is less opportunity available to resellers such as Bohdan,Falcon and GTSI.andM;As a result, these distributors must set prices carefully to maintain revenuegrowth, with consequent reductions in their profitability.andP;  Not surprisingly,these companies are busy transforming themselves into &quot;systems integrators&quot;-- that is, sellers of solutions rather than just boxes.andM;Bundling SucceedsandM;By offering an integrated solution, with ingredients such as networking,software, support, training and maintenance over the life of the contract,these companies can bundle higher-margined value-added services withlow-margined standard hardware into one well-thought-out bid that can wincustomers.andM;To play in this league a vendor must lay on a suitable (and expensive)infrastructure capable of delivering the value-added services defined above,plus a direct sales force and a bid and proposal team, before business isawarded and revenue flows.andP;  Consequently, the suppliers ofmicrocomputer-based systems to the government experience a cash crunch aswell as price pressures.andM;Their profit margins probably are no better than 3 percent.andP;  Such a margin istoo thin to attract private placements of equity on reasonable terms, andWall Street is anything but enamored with government-dependent businesses.andO;This means going public is virtually impossible at this time.andM;That leaves relatively short-term, expensive bank loans as the majorfoundation on which to build a federal business focused on selling&quot;solutions.&quot;andM;Still, this can be a good business.andP;  If inventory turns are kept high, thereturn on assets is good.andP;  However, when all is said and done, the topexecutives of these companies are not enjoying themselves as much as just 18months ago.andM;A look at Falcon Microsystems' financial history illustrates the point.andO;Selling Apple's Macintosh computers has been good for Falcon.andP;  From sales ofbarely $20 million in fiscal 1987 (the company's year ends April 30), revenueclimbed to $40 million in 1988 and $87 million in 1989.andP;  Sales in fiscal1990, which ends this month, probably will come close to $140 million.andM;Not surprisingly, Falcon lost money back in 1987, broke even the followingyear and was nicely profitable in 1989.andP;  In fiscal 1990 profit margins appearto be under some pressure, but still they should approach 3 percent.andM;Finding ProfitsandM;The real issue is how profitable Falcon or any of its peers can be in thecurrent environment, facing the need to provide more and enhanced services toan evermore-demanding market.andM;One way these companies could make more money would be to reduce burdensomeinterest expenses by substituting long-term funding for bank loans.andP;  Thiswon't be easy as long as the financial community considers governmentbusiness unappealing, although a well-executed public relations campaigncould yield positive results.andM;For example, Maxima Corp., a purveyor of mostly &quot;body shop&quot; services to thefederal and local governments, succeeded in obtaining venture capital lastyear despite minimal revenue growth in the federal contracts that make up thebulk of its business.andM;To get financing, Maxima had to make major concessions regarding itsstrategy, senior management retention and overall staffing levels.andP;  But thiswas a relatively small price to pay.andM;Another possible solution is combining a couple of these distributors bymerger or acquisition.andP;  This would create a business entity with bettereconomies of scale capable of delivering better profitability.andM;By virtue of having a near-monopoly on sales of his set of products andservices, a half-billion-dollar PC distributor in the federal marketplacewould be eligible for long-term financing.andM;Egos Get in the WayandM;However, the companies in this group are headed by true entrepreneurs, menwith big egos who are unlikely to knuckle under to the other guy.andM;This is not the formula for a successful merger, although under financialstress and strain an executive's posture can change dramatically.andM;By the way, on the premise that misery loves company, I should point out thatreflecting overall market conditions, resellers or just plain retailers ofPCs to the private sector also are experiencing slowing demand growth,despite an onslaught of new, technologically advanced products.andM;Major chains such as Businessland, the Computer Factory and Inacomp haveexperienced difficulties recently.andP;  Each of these had sought refuge in arelatively low level of &quot;systems integration&quot; some time back.andM;Ulric Weil is president of Weil andamp; Associates, a Washington consulting firm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
