<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-37-0534 </DOCNO><TEXT>The invention refers to devices for carrying out material and heat exchangeprocesses between gas and liquid, for example for carrying out rectification,absorption, chemical absorption, wet dust extraction from gas, coolingand humidification of gases, on a rotating material and heat exchangerfor gases and liquids. The preferred area of use of the invention isthe vacuum rectification of materials, which are sensitive to high temperatures.The purpose of the invention is to develop a rotating heat exchanger,whose design ensures safe overflow of liquids from one trickling stageto the next, even if the apparatus moves away from a vertical positionto a horizontal position.
