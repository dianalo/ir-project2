MichelAoun, said Wednesday the United States was involved in ``aconspiracy of silence'' by failing to halt Syrian attacks onLebanon's Christian heartland.   Aoun addressed about 1,200 Christians who braved intermittentrocket and artillery barrages and marched to the presidentialpalace in suburban Baabda to support Aoun's ``war of liberation''against Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon.   Christian parliamentarians have called for a cease-fire in thefighting with the Syrians and their Druse Moslem militia allies.   But the demonstrators rejected the suggestion, highlighting asplit in the Christian camp. The demonstrators burned an effigy ofSyrian President Hafez Assad and chanted ``Death to Assad!''   Police say 270 people have been killed and 975 wounded since thelatest round of fighting flared March 8. Most victims have beencivilians.   Several rounds of rocket and mortar fire struck Christian eastBeirut and Moslem west Beirut on Wednesday, but there were noreports of casualties.   Only a handful of people ventured outside, and radio stationssaid the relative calm was no more than a ``warriors' rest.''   ``America's secretary of state says the United States isincapable of doing anything to help Lebanon. This is the plot.America is not incapable, but America is taking part in aconspiracy of silence regarding the destruction of Lebanon bySyria,'' Aoun said.   He was commenting on Secretary of State James A. Baker III'sremarks Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Baker said: ``We make a lot of statements and sometimes it isfrustrating to think that is really about all we can do.   ``I don't know what else, frankly, we can do. We have scantinfluence with the Syrians,'' Baker said.   Aoun said sarcastically, ``Maybe Syria has become so powerfulthat America is scared of it.''   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwilersaid the United States would support ``any efforts'' by U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to help negotiate acease-fire.   France, which has close ties to the Lebanese and ruled thecountry until 1943, suggested Perez de Cuellar travel to Syria orTunisia to work out a cease-fire. The U.N. chief said he was notconsidering any such initiative as long as efforts by the 22-memberArab League continue.   The latest hostilities broke out after Aoun ordered a blockadeof militia-run ports that deprive the treasury of $100 million ayear in tax revenue.   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt retaliated by shelling the310-square-mile Christian enclave. The Syrians later joined theshelling.   Beirut and its surroundings have been without electricity sinceSunday, when power plants ran out of fuel oil. The stations alsohave been severely damaged in the bombardments.   Water supplies also have stopped. Bread and other vitalcommodities have become scarce. The shortages and shelling haveforced thousands of people to flee to south and east Lebanon orleave the country altogether.   The French navy ship Rance carried 78 severely wounded Lebaneseto Larnaca, Cyprus, on Wednesday. Fifty-three of the casualtieswere flown to Paris aboard a special French hospital plane. Theothers needed another day of quiet before they could be moved,doctors said.</TEXT></DOC>
