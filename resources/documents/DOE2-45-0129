As a fuelit contains energy three times as much as oil per unit of mass. Hydrogencan be used for the different energy needs in the household, as wellas for the production of electricity. Increased use of energy is possibleonly if production and storage problems are solved. A futuristic solutioncould be the splitting of water by solar radiation together with semiconductingagents. Metal hydrids are an ideal solution for the storage of hydrogen.Even heat pumps that use hydrogen as the working medium are possiblewhen metal hydrides are used.</TEXT></DOC>
