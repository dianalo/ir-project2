ATandamp;T said the charge probably would be a one-time measureand range between $5.5 billion and $7.5 billion. While thecharge won't affect the company's cash position or operatingresults, it could cut net income by at least $4.23 to $5.77 ashare in the quarter if the number of ATandamp;T's common sharesoutstanding remain at the current level of 1.3 billionshares. ATandamp;T won't comment on future earnings.</LP><TEXT>   Last year, the company earned $3.1 billion, or $2.42 ashare, including results from NCR Corp. Minus NCR, ATandamp;Tearned $2.73 billion, or $2.51 a share in 1990.   ATandamp;T and other big companies are following a newaccounting rule adopted by the Financial Accounting StandardsBoard that requires all companies by 1993 to begin accruingfor the projected costs of retiree benefits over the workinglives of the eligible employees. Companies currently bookthese costs only when benefits are actually paid to retireesbecause any accrual wouldn't be tax deductible, as arereserves for future pension costs. Under the new rule,companies can take a &quot;catch-up&quot; charge at once or stretch thecharge over a period of as many as 20 years.   &quot;Most likely we'd take it all at one time&quot; rather thanspread it, said an ATandamp;T spokesman.   ATandamp;T said the difference between its old method ofaccounting and the new one might either cause &quot;no additionalimpact on earnings in future years&quot; or &quot;at most {cut}earnings . . . by approximately $100 million annually.&quot;   ATandamp;T's expected charge follows four major hits coveringwrite-downs of assets, restructurings and work-forcereduction programs. So far, these have cut ATandamp;T's reportedearnings by more than $24 billion since the breakup of theBell system in 1984.   However, ATandamp;T's plan is similar to others recentlyannounced by major corporations such as General Motors Corp.and International Business Machines Corp. GM has said itwould take between $16 billion and $24 billion in charges tocover its reserve for retiree health benefits. Earlier thisyear, IBM took a first-quarter charge of $2.3 billion, orabout $4 a share, to cover its charge.   ---   Lee Berton contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
