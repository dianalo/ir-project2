Previous studies of the mineralogy of western U.S. flyash using x-ray diffraction (XRD) form the framework of the present study.A database of chemical, mineralogical and physical properties, alongwith precursor coal characteristics, is being assembled. Based on studiesto date of several hundred fly ash samples derived from lignite and subbituminouscoals, as well as from several bituminous ashes, correlations of chemistryand mineralogy have been hypothesized and are being tested. These correlationsare discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
