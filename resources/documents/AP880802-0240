Mario Cuomo removerecalcitrant council members from office.   ``There does have to come a moment of truth, a moment ofresponsibility, a moment when the city of Yonkers seeks not tobecome the national symbol of defiance to civil rights, heapingshame upon shame upon itself,'' said District Judge Leonard Sand.   Ruling that Yonkers was in contempt for not approving his planto desegregate housing, Sand fined the city $100 for the first dayand said the amount would double each succeeding day.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   This summer's wildfiresare exciting scientists over the prospect of a wildernesslaboratory, while dismaying tourism officials faced with fewervisitors to the oldest national park.   The fires also have touched off a lively debate about how muchman should interfere with nature's ways in the West.   ``There is a great scientific interest in this because therewill be a tremendous release of forage and habitat for wildlife,''Yellowstone Superintendent Robert Barbee said Tuesday. ``On theother hand, if you are making your living on tourism ... you don'twant to impede tourism to the area.''   Indeed, while scientists wait eagerly to reach charredbackcountry areas to study the effects of the park's mostextraordinary fire assault in three centuries, Wyoming andYellowstone officials are trying to get the word out that the parkremains open.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Iran-Contra prosecutor on Tuesdaysuggested postponing Oliver L.
