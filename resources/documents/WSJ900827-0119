Thequestion is why the Bush Administration has been helping thegreens succeed.   In a normal world, a clean environment and privateproperty are perfectly compatible. As residents of Leningrador Leipzig know, private owners do far better by preservationthan socialists have done. But in their zeal to cleanse theworld of man's sins, U.S. enviros have been ignoring theConstitution's Fifth Amendment ban against the &quot;taking&quot; ofprivate property without compensation. Idaho Republican SteveSymms tried to remind them late last month by offering amodest amendment to the Senate farm bill. He ran into thebuzzsaw of the green lobby and its friends at theEnvironmental Protection Agency.</LP><TEXT>   The Symms amendment is hardly radical. All it would do isrequire the Justice Department to review the guidelinesfederal agencies use to vet regulations so they aren't anunconstitutional &quot;taking.&quot; In effect, the amendment wouldenforce a 1988 executive order (reissued by George Bush)implementing two Supreme Court judgments on &quot;takings.&quot; TheWhite House agreed not to oppose the amendment, but EPAfought it behind the scenes on Capitol Hill lest anyone elseget a chance to question its judgment.   Rhode Island Republican John Chafee told fellow Senatorsthe green lobby considered this an &quot;environmental&quot; vote. TheNational Wildlife Federation issued a hysterical letterclaiming it would result in &quot;superfluous takings lawsuits,&quot;as if lawsuits haven't been the warp and woof of modernenvironmentalism. The amendment lost 52-43, with proteanconservatives Gordon Humphrey (R., N.H.) and AlabamaDemocrats Richard Shelby and Howell Heflin joining liberalsin voting against property rights.   This opposition is strange, because support for Symmscrosses normal ideological lines. Free-market farm groupssupport the idea, but so does the usually pro-regulationAmerican Agriculture Movement. They've united in oppositionto the way federal agencies -- the EPA and Army Corps ofEngineers -- have imperially blocked development on mostprivate wetlands throughout the U.S.   In a letter to Senators, AAM's national director, DavidSenter, wrote that U.S. farmers stand to lose &quot;25% to 50% oftheir net equity due to the outright taking of their land bythe federal government.&quot; Federal agencies, he added, &quot;areusing wetlands delineation, clean water, and other laws as away to take control of vast areas of farmland, much of whichhas been farmed for decades and has nothing to do withpermanent wetlands.&quot;   This doesn't impress top EPA officials, who've long talkedas if the Founders' notions about property are quaintanachronisms. Reviewing a book in 1988, EPA general counselDonald Elliott endorsed &quot;an evolutionary theory of property.&quot;He added that, &quot;Such a theory will not conclude, however,that the only system of property possible in a Darwinianworld is 19th-century capitalism's.&quot;   EPA Director William Reilly has attacked what he called,as recently as 1985, &quot;mainstream attitudes about privateproperty and freedom of action.&quot; He criticized theseattitudes for producing &quot;tawdry gateways to some of ourgreatest national parks.&quot; Apparently, Mr. Reilly's aestheticsensibilities are offended by the Motel Sixes and Citgostations that serve the hoi polloi outside the parks. He'salso written that &quot;conscious public choice&quot; -- i.e., his ownregulatory choice -- is needed, or else, gasp, &quot;the marketwill decide which land gets developed and which remains as itis.&quot;   As it happens, U.S. courts are moving against Mr. Reilly'sviews -- and toward more protection for property rights.Shortly before the Senate voted on Symms, the U.S. ClaimsCourt ordered the U.S. to pay substantial fines for unfairly&quot;taking&quot; private wetlands. It ordered $1,029,000 incompensation for the Army Corps' refusal to allow limestonemining on 98 acres in Dade County, Fla. It also awarded $2.66million for a taking of 12.5 acres in Long Beach Township,N.J., once again after the Army Corps denied any development.So taxpayers will now have to pay for regulatory mistakesthat the Symms amendment is designed to prevent.   As Soviet reformers know, private property rights lead toa cleaner environment because they imply individualresponsibility. Maybe what Bill Reilly and his EPA colleaguesneed is a couple of years studying Lake Baikal to remindthem.</TEXT></DOC>
