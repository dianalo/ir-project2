Overseas Private Investment Corp. says it plans toincrease to $400 million its yearly loans and loan guaranteesto small companies that do business abroad. In 1991, OPICprovided $290 million in direct loans and loan guarantees tosuch concerns.                                                                                                          The agency is attempting &quot;to meet growing demand andsupport important new foreign-policy initiatives,&quot; saysRobert Draggon, vice president, finance. These initiatives&quot;are opening up new markets for small businesses and creatingnew opportunities,&quot; he adds.   In 1991, OPIC says it provided $40 million in direct loansto 12 small businesses, including Nandamp;B Jewelry Corp., NewYork, which is starting to make jewelry in Costa Rica, andCaresbac, a unit of CARE, the relief and developmentorganization, to invest in Poland. The agency also providedloans for a gold-mining venture in Ivory Coast and anindustrial park in Honduras. In addition, OPIC guaranteed$250 million in loans.   Much of the money in 1992 is expected to go to EasternEuropean countries, including Poland, Hungary andCzechoslovakia, Mr. Draggon says. The projects range fromsetting up laundromats and leasing railroad cars todeveloping agriculture-based businesses, he says.   Mr. Draggon also sees increased demand for projects in theCaribbean. &quot;Their proximity to the U.S. and greater economicstability in the region&quot; are main attractions, he says.   ---   REGIONAL firms become key providers of venture financing.   As big venture-capital firms steer clear of financingearly-stage companies, some smaller regional concerns arefilling the void. Among the most prominent regional investorsare Hill, Carman, Kirby andamp; Washing, of Boulder, Colo.; EdisonVenture Fund, of Lawrenceville, N.J.; Noro-Moseley Partners,of Atlanta; Massey-Burch Investment Group Inc., of Nashville,Tenn.; CID Venture Partners, of Indianapolis; and MedicalInnovation Partners, of Minneapolis.   Florida Seed Capital Fund, of Tampa, Fla., says it plansthis summer to make its first investments in Floridastart-ups. The fund, which expects to have about $20 millionto invest, was planned last year because &quot;there is noprofessionally managed seed capital available for mostFlorida start-ups,&quot; says M. Scott Faris, executive directorof the Florida Seed Capital Board, which is partially backedby the state and helped organize the seed fund.   For a growing number of start-ups, these regional firmsare investors of last resort as other funding sourcesdwindle. &quot;Many good local deals won't get done unless we doit,&quot; says venture capitalist John Hill, a partner of HillCarman. Moreover, a successful local company can be just asprofitable as any national start-up, he says. His ventureconcern was the only investor when several Coloradoentrepreneurs launched Exabyte Corp., a Boulder maker ofdata-storage devices. &quot;Thirty-four venture funds turned themdown,&quot; Mr. Hill recalls. Exabyte, which was valued at$800,000 when Hill Carman invested in 1985, now has a marketvalue of about $680 million.   Noro-Mosely recently invested in Telecorp Systems Inc., anAtlanta concern that provides equipment to cable-televisionoperators to help automate their services. It also is aninvestor in ATC Services Inc., an Atlanta provider of nursesfor temporary jobs.   Says Charles Mosely, a partner of Noro-Mosely. &quot;It'seasier to invest in a company and work with it over a periodof time if you are close.&quot;   ---   MINORITY INVESTMENT pools push for more capital.   Fairfield Capital, a Farmington, Conn., limitedpartnership, has its first big investor, a Northeast publicpension fund. Fairfield began in August to raise $250 millionto invest primarily in minority-owned businesses. Chicago'sArk Capital Management has begun an effort to raise between$250 million and $300 million for funds that invest inminority-owned businesses.   &quot;Capital to such investment firms has been decliningsteadily, especially at a time when minority-owned businessesneed more capital than ever,&quot; says JoAnn Price, a generalpartner of Fairfield.   Ms. Price adds, &quot;We are trying to provide these venturefunds access to a pool of institutional capital that has beenuntapped till now.&quot;   ---   AN INDUSTRY GROUP taps a bank for loans for smallcontractors.   Regional Alliance for Small Contractors Inc., whichconsists of major New York construction companies and stateagencies, has developed a loan program for small New Yorkcontractors. The program will provide working capital tosmall contractors that do business with the state.   Under the program, Citibank will provide loans of $50,000to $250,000 to small contractors to finance individualcontracts or to help extend existing credit lines. Thealliance will screen loans and monitor performance of thecontracts, says Timothy Sheehan, executive director. It alsowill tap some of its members to act as troubleshooters ifproblems arise.   The alliance was formed last June because big constructioncompanies and state agencies &quot;depend upon a competitive poolof small contractors to do the work,&quot; Mr. Sheehan explains.The alliance also hopes a growing share of new public worksjobs will go to minority-owned contractors, many of whom lackthe financial resources to compete effectively, he says.   &quot;Access to capital is a national issue for smallcontractors, especially businesses owned by women andminorities,&quot; Mr. Sheehan says. &quot;We're hoping the program cango nationwide.&quot;   ---   ODDS andamp; ENDS: Two-thirds of fast-growing companies don'tknow how much they're worth, says accounting firm Coopers andamp;Lybrand after a survey. Even though a current valuation is a&quot;strategic must&quot; before a company tries for new financing orseeks a buyer, surprisingly few companies have had themselvesevaluated, the firm says. . . . The Small Business StockExchange of America says its headquarters will be in Hampton,Va. The exchange plans to trade shares in small companieswith sales between $1 million and $20 million.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
