(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   What has a nutty flavor and looks likebrown scrambled eggs?   Bakuti. That's Nepalese for squished honeybees.   What looks like ridged french fries, only with eyes and legs,and tastes great deep-fried?   Bamboo worms.   Yuk, you say? How about a nice helping of honey instead?   Sorry to disappoint you, but it's really bee barf.   OK, so maybe you can deal with the truth about honey. But that'snot all. Most Americans don't realize they're already eating apound or two of insects every year.   You just can't see them because they're ground up into tinylittle chunks in your strawberry jam, peanut butter, spaghettisauce, applesauce and frozen chopped broccoli.   The insect parts even add to the protein, making some productsmore nutritious, said Michael Burgett, an entomologist at OregonState University.   He estimates every acre of land in Oregon contains about 100pounds of insect protein. In tropical areas, it's about 400 pounds.   Burgett bemoans the fact that most of the protein is going towaste. Except for that extra touch of tartness in the jam on yourEnglish muffin, of course.   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says there is no way toeliminate all bugs from our food, so it sets what are called``defect action levels'' to control the amount of insect parts,rodent hairs, molds and other tiny particles that pose no healthhazard.   ``Essentially, the FDA is saying you can only have enough bugsso you can't see them,'' Burgett said.   ``We have an innate bias against insects I blame on our Europeanheritage. For our culture, insects are outside the realm of food.The glaring exception is honey, which is bee vomit, essentially.It's a plant product mediated by an insect.''   Burgett is an internationally recognized expert on bees. Herespects bees. He is fascinated with their behavior.   And, he said, they make delicious cookies.   ``A pound of bees is about 3,500 bees. You put them in the ovenat low heat for eight hours, then grind or blend the dry husks intoflour. Makes great cookies. About half my students ate the cookiesthe first year I made them. Most of them said they didn't taste anydifferent. So I cheated the second year and put in `Grape-Nuts' tomake them crunchy.''   But if you really want crunchy, the giant waterbug is theappetizer of choice. Roasted and eaten whole, it's a favorite inAsia, said Burgett, who's sampled a variety of insect fare.   ``You'll find that Asian cultures have incorporated insects intheir diets for a long time. One of the most popular insects inAsia is the giant waterbug, which is like a big cockroach. It'seasily collected around lights at night, especially around ponds.''   In Thailand, you can judge a restaurant by the bugs on the menu.   ``In Thailand, about 50 species of insects are commonly eaten.That's a lot. And they're eaten by a broad spectrum of society.I've gone to very nice Thai restaurants and they have excellentinsect dishes on the menu,'' Burgett said.   American consumers are so finicky about bugs they'll never eatthem, Burgett said. At least they won't ``mass consume'' them inthe numbers needed to make bug ranching a solid commercial success.   ``They've talked about using termites in the Northwest. Highlynutritious with high protein content per body weight. But who'sgoing to eat them?   ``Bee keepers in western Canada kill their bees in the fallbecause it's too expensive to keep them through the winter. Theyrestock from Southern California in the spring but all those beepupae are going to waste. The major hurdle, again, is who wants toeat it? There is a gourmet market in Japan for the male pupae ofthe honeybee, but that market is small.''   If people won't eat cooked bugs, no matter how tasty andnutritious, at least they could tolerate more bugs in what they doeat, Burgett said. If the FDA would relax the limit for insectparts, say double it, U.S. farmers could significantly reduce theamount of pesticides sprayed every year.   ``Snap beans are a perfect example. The 12-spotted cucumberbeetle takes tiny little bites out of the beans. It doesn't harmthe bean but consumers want perfection. So the growers spray thebeans to rid them of beetles and bite marks. When growers drive upto the food processing plant, people sample the beans and bitemarks, and if the ratio is too high, the company will tell thegrower, `We'll have to process this batch differently,' so thegrowers makes less money.''   Farmers are spraying less because pesticides costs are risingand alternate pest management strategies are working, Burgett said.Much of the spraying that remains is for appearance, and that won'tchange until consumers stop being so squeamish about bugs, he said.   ``If you say, `I don't want any bugs in my food, and I don'twant any insecticide residue,' then we'll all starve,'' Burgettsaid.   ``I'd rather eat more insects and less pesticide residue,'' hesaid.   Will consumers agree? Burgett is a pessimist.   ``Consumer acceptance is a big problem. Fifty years ago, itwouldn't matter if an apple had a moth larva inside, or if the beanhad a beetle bite. Are these people shopping for flawless appleswilling to pay the price for less insecticides? I think not.''   But he has advice for environmentalists and consumers who wantto reduce the pesticides in our food: ``Bug the government.''</TEXT><NOTE>End advance for Aug. 13</NOTE></DOC>
