A year after President Bush proclaimed the Sandamp;L debacle tobe on the road to solution, the administration and Congressare mired more deeply than ever in what has become thenation's biggest financial crisis since the Depression.</LP><TEXT>   Indeed, the Sandamp;L anniversary serves as a reminder that theunderlying causes of the mess -- government by delay anddiffused responsibility -- haven't changed a bit one yearlater. &quot;There has been an absolute breakdown in politicalaccountability,&quot; says Thomas &quot;Lud&quot; Ashley, a formerDemocratic congressman from Ohio and a close friend of Mr.Bush.   Adds Scott Hodge, a budget analyst for the conservativeHeritage Foundation: &quot;I don't blame voters for not knowingwhere to turn. To throw this bum out might just mean you getanother bum.&quot;   The administration defends both the bailout law and itsown record in handling the crisis. The anniversary &quot;is not anoccasion for celebration, nor is it an occasion for despair,&quot;says John Robson, undersecretary of the Treasury. First andforemost, officials say, they have succeeded in keeping thefederal government's time-honored promise to protectdepositors.   But administration officials also acknowledge that theefforts of the past year have resulted in a host ofconsequences they never intended. Faced with initialcomplaints that few sick Sandamp;Ls were being sold, the newbailout agency created by the law went into high gear in thisyear's April-June quarter and blew a hole in the federalbudget, prompting President Bush's admission that a taxincrease is possible. Some economists blame the real-estateslump on Sandamp;L overbuilding, and see the current credit crunchas a reaction to freewheeling Sandamp;L lending.   Further, the news from the thrift front will take anespecially ugly turn if the U.S. moves into a recession,causing more Sandamp;Ls to fail and driving bailout costs evenhigher. Banks, saddled with huge debts to the Third World andtheir own extensive real-estate lending, could suffer biglosses, too.   To be sure, if energy prices soar due to a sudden shortageof Mideast oil supplies, the Texas economy might rebound. Butprices would have to be high and sustained before improvedprices in Texas real estate would take some of the sting outof the bailout costs.   Right now, at least, the main response to the looming Sandamp;Lcrisis is an orgy of political recrimination that shows nosigns of abating. Next month, House Banking CommitteeChairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) plans high-profilehearings that will haul former Reagan administrationofficials such as ex-Treasury Secretary Donald Regan beforethe committee to account for their actions, or inactions.Also capturing public attention next month will be hearingson the role of Neil Bush, the president's son, in the $1billion failure of Colorado's Silverado Savings andamp; Loan.   Support is also building in Congress and elsewhere for apresidential commission to investigate the causes of the Sandamp;Lcrisis -- which will almost certainly provide more grist forthe blame game.   Congress has also made a major show of going afterso-called &quot;Sandamp;L kingpins,&quot; most recently with its swiftlypassed thrift-fraud bill. But even some proponents of the lawacknowledge it will likely have little practical impact,since it isn't retroactive and many of the offenses werecommitted years ago. Moreover, despite voter fury at Sandamp;Lexecutives, most observers believe bad business decisions byan undersupervised industry were far more to blame thanout-and-out fraud. &quot;The incidence of fraud is clearly beingexaggerated,&quot; says Stanford University economist DanielBrumbaugh. &quot;It's all window dressing.&quot;   Officials involved in the bailout say the swirlingpolitics surrounding the effort are complicating their jobjust as they move into what may be the most sensitive phase:the attempt to sell off the billions of dollars ofreal-estate assets that have been salvaged from the deadinstitutions.   Already, a bevy of congressional committees have hauledcurrent and former regulators to Capitol Hill to grill themon sales of institutions, salaries paid, and why they aremoving slowly and costing money, or quickly and imprudently.The accusatory atmosphere has regulators looking nervouslyover their shoulders before they commit to a sale and,officials say, may also drive away some potential buyers.   &quot;They haul these guys up and hang them in the middle ofthe village square,&quot; says Treasury's Mr. Robson. &quot;There arepeople who will say, `I don't need that.'&quot;   Yet many in Congress say the administration must acceptpart of the blame for the supercharged atmosphere throughtheir own behavior. &quot;They set themselves up for accusationsthat sound political,&quot; says Sen. Bob Kerrey (D., Neb.) &quot;Wehave almost no accountability for the expenditures they aremaking. They control all the information in this.&quot;   Meanwhile, neither Congress nor the administration has yetmanaged to do much about the major pending issues that bothadmit have to be addressed. One big problem is the cleanuplaw itself. There so far has been little political appetitefor reopening and rewriting the controversial measure, eventhough some of its contradictory provisions have regulatorsthrowing up their hands in frustration.   Among other things, the regulators are having a hard timereconciling the bill's requirements that they sell seizedproperty as quickly as possible, and that they not affectreal-estate markets. The law also was intended to makethrifts invest more prudently, yet it forces them to puttheir money almost entirely into one area, home mortgages.   Already, several federal courts have challenged parts ofthe bailout law, and some observers say major parts of itcould be in serious legal jeopardy unless Congress and theadministration fix it. &quot;There was a lot of mindless vengeancein the law,&quot; warns Dallas thrift attorney Richard Kneipper.&quot;We're going to see a lot more of these suits.&quot;   Both Congress and the administration have been reluctantto press the politically sensitive issue of federal depositinsurance, despite the fact that many officials admit thatthe increase in deposit insurance to $100,000 was a majorcontributing factor in the debacle. Any serious discussion ofthe issue has been shoved back at least until the TreasuryDepartment completes a study on the subject at the end of theyear -- safely after the November elections.   Another major contributing factor also remainsunaddressed: the campaign-finance laws. The Senate passed aspending-limit bill last week before it recessed, butPresident Bush believes it is skewed toward favoringDemocrats, and it is certain veto bait. Meanwhile, candidatesof both parties are engaged in a game ofreturn-the-thrift-industry-contributions, trumpeting theirvirtue after accepting, in some cases, tens of thousands ofdollars from thrifts for years.   &quot;It doesn't make any difference if you've blown thecountry to hell financially,&quot; says former Rep. Ashley. &quot;Youstill get elected.&quot;   ---                   Sandamp;L Cleanup Chronology                                                                                                          Feb. 6, 1989 -- President Bush unveils plan to protect Sandamp;Ldepositors, costing $73 billion, not including interest.
