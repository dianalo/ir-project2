The back of each pin shows an airplane bearing a strong resemblance to the planes of United's arch-nemesis, Continental Airlines. Imbedded in the plane's golden tail is a giant screw.    Deregulation has fanned the flames of competition in the entire airline industry, but there is no fiercer fight than that between United and Continental at Denver's bustling and overloaded Stapleton Airport. Long-timers in the once-genteel industry say they have never seen such down-in-the-mud tactics. &quot;It's a desperate fight,&quot; says Alfred Kahn, former chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board. &quot;It's trench warfare.&quot;    United is reveling in the battle. Continental, after a slow start, is fighting back. Its president, Thomas Plaskett, recently accused United of &quot;dirty tricks.&quot; Last month, when United announced a nationwide fare increase, Continental issued a statement saying: &quot;We think it stinks.&quot;    The only people not complaining are the customers -- not yet at least. Here at Stapleton Airport, travelers who once fended off Hare Krishnas and devotees of Lyndon LaRouche now contend with some of the most relentless ticket agents in the entire world.    United employees even board rental-car buses in the airport parking lot to cajole Continental passengers into flying the friendly skies instead.    A United agent scours his computer terminal for names of Continental passengers. When he finds one, he pages the person to the United counter, where the unsuspecting passenger gets a dose of United salesmanship. He is informed of United flights that are more convenient than those of the competitor. He might get a free cup of coffee. He certainly receives plenteous smiles.    The scene at Stapleton Airport shows how untrammeled competition can become when two airlines decide that price-chopping isn't the only way to get business. Whether the tactics spread to other airports and markets depends on myriad factors.    But if airline agents like United's Vanessa Connally have anything to do with it, the trend could mushroom. &quot;This is the most fun I've ever had,&quot; she says as she tries to pick up new passengers for the airline at the airport's Hertz car-rental counter.    The high stakes involved at Stapleton Airport help explain why the competitors are setting new lows in airline personnel behavior. Denver is a &quot;hub&quot; city for both United and Continental: Most of the airlines' Western routes connect through Denver, and Stapleton Airport houses Continental's largest operations in the country and United's second largest. Denver is a significant revenue and profit center for both, and the two airlines share almost equally an impressive 85% of Denver's air traffic.    Competition in the Denver area has been bruising since the early 1980s. Fare cutting was so deep last year that both United and Continental were sustaining losses on many routes, and Frontier Airlines, which was based in Denver, was pushed out of the business altogether.    Air fares are still highly competitive, although they have rebounded from the unrealistic lows of last year, when the cost of flying from Denver to Los Angeles, Chicago or Houston was only $39. Now, the competition has exploded beyond the narrow arena of fares.    United renovated its concourse earlier this year, spending $40 million; Continental's overhaul begins in a few months. Continental started broadcasting commercials with Denver quarterback John Elway; United hired &quot;Mrs. Colorado,&quot; redheaded Rebecca Sein, to smile and pour coffee for passengers in the airport concourse.    Then there is Torque, United's macho-sounding, guerrilla salesmanship campaign, which began this spring. (Torque is an example within Allegis Corp., the parent company of both United Airlines and Hertz Corp., of two susidiaries working together to bolster each other's operations. This so-called synergy was the corporate dream of former Allegis Chairman Richard Ferris, who this month was replaced by Frank Olsen, the former chairman of Hertz.)    Torque's success, and the eagerness of United's managers to take credit for it, have made it almost impossible for an outsider to divine the program's real origins. Many trace the program back to an incident here last March, during a time when Continental's parent company, Texas Air Corp., was having dire problems digesting a slew of acquisitions. (Continental now comprises former operations of People Express Inc., Frontier Airlines and New York Air.) Continental ran its staff ragged, flights were often late, and mountains of baggage routinely disappeared.    That day in March, a Continental ticket line at Stapleton Airport grew and grew, unfurling across the airport's marble lobby until it encroached on a United line.    &quot;It started to aggravate our agents and inconvenience our passengers,&quot; says Marc Wallace, a United vice president. United's employees began suggesting to the Continental passengers that they defect to United's shorter line. &quot;Their waits were 45 minutes to an hour,&quot; Mr. Wallace says. &quot;We didn't have to push too hard.&quot;    Once blood was tasted by United's employees, it was only a matter of time before they organized the &quot;Torque force&quot; -- ticket agents who voluntarily wander the airport and the computer banks, looking for passengers to poach.    The members of the Torque force converse in &quot;Torque-speak.&quot; They dial up a special &quot;Torque-line&quot; for information on competing flights. They regale each other with Torque tales during slack time. They go &quot;Torqueing&quot; -- riding Hertz buses looking for ticket converts. They receive no special bonuses or commissions for their Torqueing.    The group's early forays into Continental's territory in Stapleton Airport outraged the airline's executives, who promptly demanded action from the airport authorities.    &quot;We had to tell them to cool it,&quot; says Richard Bouluare of the airport director's staff. Lease agreements, he explains, restrict airline employees to their own airline's area. &quot;We can't let things get out of control,&quot; Mr. Bouluare adds.    United complied but vowed to continue Torqueing. An afternoon with Jerry Martinez, one of the airline's top Torquers, shows what serious business it is.    Mr. Martinez is busy helping passengers board a flight to Orlando. But he takes time to page an arriving United passenger named John Hagood three times. Mr. Martinez has learned that Mr. Hagood intends to depart from Denver on a Continental flight.    When a bewildered gentleman approaches the United counter, Mr. Martinez knows he has his man. &quot;Hello, Mr. Hagood!&quot; Mr. Martinez beams, before persuading him to switch his flight. Mr. Hagood is overwhelmed, but he hands over his ticket.    &quot;I'm a little surprised they keep such close tabs on us,&quot; he says. Mr. Martinez says he was once offered an on-the-spot job by a passenger impressed with his sales technique. &quot;I turned it down,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm enjoying this.&quot;    He isn't the only United employee who Torques full-time. David Graham, a United ticket agent for 10 years, was eating in a Denver restaurant when he overheard a family in the next booth planning a trip to Seattle -- on Continental. Mr. Graham dashed to a pay phone to call the Torqueline, checked seat availability on a United flight and returned to his table to convert the family. He also apologized for eavesdropping. (United executives insist that passengers aren't harassed if they refuse to change airlines.) Over at Continental, Torqueing has brought out the bravado.    &quot;When I saw they were doing this,&quot; says Curt Bourg, Continental's assistant general manager at Stapleton, &quot;I smiled. I thought it was recognition of how well we are doing.&quot; In fact, Continental's salaries are among the lowest in the industry, and one problem the company doesn't face is overzealousness among its employees.    Continental's president, Mr. Plaskett, says the company has recently beefed up its training program for agents in Denver. &quot;I think this {Torque} is drawing us all together,&quot; he says. He firmly refuses to launch Continental's own version of Torque. &quot;We aren't parading down the concourse and bothering customers,&quot; he says, shaking his head. &quot;That's childish.&quot;    It is too early for either airline to tell who is winning, if anyone, in the current war of salesmanship. Each airline cites statistics that are instantly and vehemently rebutted by the competitor.    Continental is aggressively beefing up the number of flights it offers from Denver, adding 17 new departures, including new, nonstop London service. United, meanwhile, has scaled back its flights, which it claims is necessary to deploy some of its aircraft in a battle it is waging at Washington's Dulles Airport. Continental is delighted: it now offers Denver passengers a much wider choice of flights than its rival.    But Stapleton Airport's customers clearly are impressed with a ticket agent who smiles and beckons, rather than snarling and sighing.    &quot;This is legal, right?&quot; asks Andrea Hiltrop as she cashes in $1,200 worth of Continental tickets at a United counter. &quot;I didn't have any complaint with Continental,&quot; Mrs. Hiltrop demurs, &quot;but it's very nice to get this special treatment.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
