But in-ground reserves of the Chicago-based company continued to tilt toward natural gas -- further evidence that major U.S. oil companies are increasing their dependence on the long-depressed natural gas market. Largely because of increased demand from industry, Amoco said in its 1987 annual report that its U.S. natural gas production jumped 9.2% last year, about twice the increase in nationwide gas consumption. Meanwhile, Amoco's domestic crude oil production fell 1.5%.    Natural gas is expected to become even more important to the company. &quot;We anticipate exploiting our large U.S. natural gas reserves at an accelerated pace,&quot; Amoco said in the report.    Amoco's proposed $4 billion acquisition of Calgary-based Dome Petroleum Ltd. is largely a natural-gas play. On an energy-equivalent basis, Dome owns more than twice as much natural gas as it does oil.    All told, Amoco said it replaced 130% of the reserves that it produced last year, recovering from a weak record in 1986. Exxon Corp. said earlier this week that it replaced 114% of its oil and gas production in 1987. Texaco Inc., which has had one of the worst records of the big integrated oil companies, replaced 70% of its production last year. Although that is up from 46% in 1986, Texaco's production also fell last year.    Weaker natural gas prices somewhat offset Amoco's increased sales volume last year, but the company believes the economic outlook is favorable this year, and predicted that nationwide consumption will rise another 3%. &quot;As supplies tighten with increased demand, we expect prices to strengthen,&quot; the company said. It expects oil prices, however, to fluctuate in the same range as last year.    For 1988, Amoco said it budgeted a 27% increase in capital and exploration spending to $3.8 billion. A company spokesman said 65% to 70% of that sum is budgeted for exploration and production. While the overall spending increase is the first since 1985, it is far short of the $5.3 billion spent that year.    Amoco said it continues to cut costs in its exploration and production sector, which has been &quot;redefined and reoriented to earn acceptable returns in the down cycles of our industry, as well as during the up cycles.&quot; In addition, Amoco is joining the rest of the industry in spending more of its exploration dollars in foreign countries, which aren't nearly as picked over as oil fields in the U.S.    In refining and marketing, Amoco is expecting another soft year because of competitive pressures on product margins.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Amoco shares closed at $74.50, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
