The ads, polls and direct-mail appeals are being paid for by theAuto Dealers and Drivers for Free Trade political action committee,based in Jamaica, N.Y. The group, described in a PAC guide asrepresenting mostly dealers of Japanese cars, says it seeks topromote election of lawmakers who oppose import restrictions.   The group is supporting the re-election bids of Sens. Chic Hechtin Nevada and Malcolm Wallop in Wyoming, and is backing GOPcandidates in open seats in Florida and Mississippi, according todocuments filed with the Federal Election Commission.   Chlopak called it the biggest effort by a single group toinfluence Senate elections since 1980, when NCPAC _ the NationalConservative Political Action Committee _ spent $1 million againstsix Democratic incumbents. That much money poured into tight raceslate in the campaign can take on undue importance, he said.   ``Their last-minute communications blitz is sufficient to bedecisive,'' he said Thursday at a news conference.   Special-interest PACs, by law, can give no more than $5,000directly to a candidate in each primary or general election. Butthere is no ceiling for independent expenditures _ those made in acandidate's behalf without coordination or consultation with thecampaign.   The Democratic campaign committee filed a formal complaint withthe FEC alleging that in the case of Florida, the import dealers'blitz is not truly independent of the campaign of GOP candidateConnie Mack. The same media buyer and direct-mail consultant used byMack also is being used by the dealers' group in other states.   Robert Bauer, a lawyer for the Democratic committee, said suchsharing of agents creates a legal presumption that independence hasbeen violated and puts a burden on the dealers to prove they havenot engaged in collusion. He asked the FEC for a quick decision onthe complaint and for an injunction to remove the Florida spots fromthe air.   The chairman of the import dealers group, Tom Nemet, said in atelephone interview that the group had adhered to the law, and heaccused the Democrats of attempting to intimidate his organization.   According to FEC reports, the import dealers PAC is spending:   _ $382,473 to support Hecht's effort to defend his seat againstNevada Gov. Richard Bryan. The money is buying a last-minute blitzof television advertising that includes positive spots for Hecht andan attack on Bryan on the issue of Social Security. The group alsopaid for a 650,000-piece mass mailing for Hecht in the past week.   _ $311,550 to boost Mack, who is locked in a close race withDemocratic Rep. Buddy MacKay for the Florida seat of retiring Sen.Lawton Chiles. The money is going for TV spots comparing Mack's andMacKay's votes on taxes, and concludes: ``A vote for Connie Mack isa vote for lower taxes.''   _ $319,126 in Mississippi to blanket the state with positivespots for Rep. Trent Lott, who is trying to capture the Senate seatof retiring Democratic Sen. John Stennis. Lott is opposed byDemocratic Rep. Wayne Dowdy.   _ $84,860 to support Wallop's re-election bid in Wyoming,including positive TV spots that began on Tuesday and a150,000-piece mass mailing.   Frank Glacken, the PAC's executive director, said the group alsois supporting two House Democratic re-election bids, spending$45,000 for Rep. Richard Stallings of Idaho and $85,000 for Rep.David Skaggs of Colorado.   The group has made direct contributions to a large number ofDemocratic Senate incumbents, as well as $15,000 gifts in 1987 and1988 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, he said.   ``Primarily we want to go in and support people who are freetraders,'' Glacken said. ``While it looks like we're spending a lotof money, labor unions give out millions,'' he said. He added thatthe giving was partly an attempt to balance the money from labor,which he said often advocates protectionist trade legislation.   Glacken said the group receives its money from about 2,000 of the4,500 people who own foreign car franchises in the United States. Hesaid contributors include both dealers of Japanese and Europeancars, and he disputed published descriptions of the group asdominated by dealers of Japanese vehicles.</TEXT></DOC>
