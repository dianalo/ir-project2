That was the second increase this year and brought the rate to its highest level in more than two years.    Further increases are likely over the next few months, bankers and economists predict. They contend that the economy will continue growing so rapidly that inflation will accelerate and the Federal Reserve will react by pushing rates higher.    &quot;I see one and possibly two more increases&quot; in the prime, or base, rate by year-end, said John D. Paulus, chief economist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. The economy has &quot;substantial upward momentum&quot; and is nearing a &quot;dangerous inflationary zone,&quot; he said, adding that the question isn't whether the Fed will act but how soon and how strongly. &quot;The Fed is going to have to do some tightening before the end of the year, and rates are going to go up,&quot; he said.    Because the latest prime-rate increase had been widely expected, it had little effect on the stock or bond markets yesterday. Nevertheless, it means higher borrowing costs for many small and medium-sized businesses whose rates are pegged to prime. Also, many banks use the prime, or reference rate as it is sometimes called, as a base rate on many types of consumer loans, such as the highly popular home-equity loans and car loans.    But the country's largest companies can afford to pay little attention to prime-rate changes. Banks are willing to offer them rates well below prime because those companies are large enough to have access to alternate, cheaper sources of credit, such as the commercial paper market.    Bankers blamed the increase on previous increases in their own borrowing costs. For example, the interest rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks, averaged 7.59% in the week ended Wednesday. That was up from just over 7% in mid-May, the last time the prime rate went up. Rates also have risen by about half a percentage point on bank certificates of deposit.    The increase came only a day after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated that the central bank is leaning in the direction of additional credit-tightening. Mr. Greenspan, in his midyear report to Congress, said the Fed &quot;at this juncture might be well advised to err more on the side of restrictiveness rather than of stimulus.&quot;    Fed officials are trying to slow the economy to an annual growth rate of 2% to 2.5% over the remainder of the year, compared with the rapid 3.6% pace in the first quarter. Mr. Greenspan said the slower pace is more in line with &quot;the long-run potential of the economy.&quot;    Chase Manhattan Bank, a unit of Chase Manhattan Corp. of New York, led the way on the latest prime-rate increase, as usual. It was quickly followed by Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., a unit of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, a unit of J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., and Bankers Trust Co., a unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp., all of New York; Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co., a unit of Continental Illinois Corp., Chicago; Mellon Bank, a unit of Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh; Bank of America, a unit of BankAmerica Corp., San Francisco; and others.    &quot;I think more increases {in the prime rate} will occur before the year is out,&quot; said James R. Solloway, director of economic research at Argus Research Corp. He said there is a &quot;good possibility&quot; of a 10% prime rate by year-end. But he also said the next increase probably won't occur until after the November elections.    &quot;Inflationary pressures, although building, have not yet caused a major rise in the broader inflation indexes,&quot; Mr. Solloway said. Also, the dollar's strength recently has eased pressure on the Fed to tighten.    But some analysts contend that the longer the Fed waits to act, the tougher its job of controlling inflation will be. &quot;I think the Fed will do too little, too late this year, which will require more appreciable tightening in 1989,&quot; said Mr. Paulus of Morgan Stanley.    The prime rate now is at its highest industrywide level since early 1986, when it also was 9 1/2%.    Last October, just before the stock market crashed, Chemical Bank, a unit of Chemical Banking Corp in New York; Marine Midland Bank, a unit of Marine Midland Banks Inc., and First Republic Bank Corp. in Dallas raised their prime rates to 9 3/4% from 9 1/4%. But other major banks left their rates unchanged, and after Black Monday those three banks quickly lowered their rates back to 9 1/2%. </TEXT></DOC>
