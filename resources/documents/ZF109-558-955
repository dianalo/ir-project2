VME64 will double thebackplane performance of the VMEbus, but sales are not expected togrow rapidly because there are not yet high-volume applicationsthat demand the performance.andP;  VME64, though, will ensurecontinuing good growth or the VME market, which is expected tosurpass $1 billion by 1993.andP;  Other trends and analyses of the VMEmarket are discussed.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     VMEbusIndustry AnalysisProduct DevelopmentGrowthPerformance Improvement64-BitUpgradingFuturebus+Communications Boards-CardsMarket Analysis.andO;Feature:   illustrationgraphphotograph.andO;Caption:   VME board market accelerates.
