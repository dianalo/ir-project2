(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   State officials and lawmakers saidthey hoped California's decision to restrict military-style assaultrifles would lead other states and Congress to follow suit.   The state Legislature, spurred by the January slayings of fivechildren in a Stockton schoolyard, sent the governor a billThursday that would make California the first state to virtuallyban sales of rifles such as the one used in that attack.   Republican Gov. George Deukmejian has agreed to sign the measureinto law.   ``We are sending ripple effects across the country,'' AttorneyGeneral John Van de Kamp said. ``What is needed in my view is anational ban ... California on so many issues is on the cuttingedge.''   ``We have struck a major blow for public safety,'' said SenatePresident Pro Tem David Roberti.   The Legislature approved the bill by votes of 27-11 in theSenate and 41-35 in the Assembly.   ``This represents the culmination of a rather lengthy andgrueling process of how we can do something to change the cultureof violence,'' Assemblyman Mike Roos said.   National Rifle Association spokesman Richard Gardiner threatenedto file a lawsuit against the measure after it takes effect nextyear.   The movement to ban the guns gained public support on Jan. 17,when deranged drifter Patrick Purdy used a semiautomatic AK-47rifle to kill five students and wound 29 children and a teacher ona Stockton playground.   The legislation is the second half of a two-part package thatwould restrict sale and possession of more than 50 models ofassault weapons, including the AK-47.   Both bills would virtually ban the sale of the affected weaponsafter Jan. 1, 1990, but would allow people who legally obtained theweapons before June 1 of this year to keep the firearms if theyregister them with the state.   It would take a special permit, like those required for machineguns, to keep an assault weapon obtained after the cutoff date.   The bills also would increase penalties for crimes committedusing assault weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
