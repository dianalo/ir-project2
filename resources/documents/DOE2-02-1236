The report outlines reactor physics studies andother activities in related areas, including evaluation of nuclear data,development of analysis techniques, cariticality experiments and analysis,benchmark experiments with shielding, reactor physics experiments withJoyo, etc. Benchmark tests uing JENDL show; (1) JENDL can predict Keffwith satisfactory accuracy, (2) the ratio of the /sup 238/U capture reactionto the /sup 239/Pu fission reaction is overestimated by 6 percent, (3)the Na-void reactivity is overestimated by 10 - 30 percent, and (4) theDoppler reactivity is underestimated by about 10 percent. In pursuitof effective analysis methods, efforts are being made to develop proceduresfor detailed cell calculation and three-dimensional nuclear calculation.The JUPITER project is in progress for large FBR core criticality experimentsusing ZPPR of ANL-Idaho. Results of core parameter experiments are beinganalyzed in Japan using JENDL-2 library. Some results of the analysisare outlined. A project, called JASPER, was started in 1985 for FBR shieldingresearch to be carried out jointly by the U.S. Depertment of Energy andthe Japan's Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation. Testsof the fast reactor Joyo have demonstrated that decay heat can be removedsatisfactorily by natural circulation. Parametric studies for shieldingdesign and design studies for axially heterogeneous cores are also outlined.(Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
