(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A research team for Intel Corp. hasdeveloped a new series of microchips capable of executing 7.5million instructions per second, the company has announced.   The microchips, known as the 80960 family, are designed for suchuses as helping control robots, airplanes, automobiles andtelecommunications, according to J. Randolph Young, director ofIntel's Oregon Microcomputer Engineering Group.   The microchips perform at two to three times the speed ofprevious microchip generations used for similar machine-controllingoperations, Young said.   In industrial markets, the chips are expected to supplement orreplace other Intel chips that have been available for as long as10 years, he said Tuesday.   The new chips' circuitry incorporates about 500,000 transistorsinto a half-inch square of silicon. The circuitry involves parallelarchitecture that allows the chip or a combination of chips toattack various parts of a problem simultaneously, Young said.   Unlike Intel's standard microprocessor and its predecessors, thenew chip is programmed only once for a specific function, he said.   Two of the new chips were designed for commercial use and theother two are for military applications, Young said.</TEXT></DOC>
