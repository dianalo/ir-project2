But leaders of the rebels, known as Contras, said their fighterswouldn't disarm until democracy is guaranteed in their homeland.   ``We're ready to comply with the Tela accords, but it's tooearly to talk about giving up our weapons,'' said rebel militarychief Enrique Bermudez in a telephone interview with The AssociatedPress.   The agreement reached Monday by five Central American presidentsin a summit at Tela, Honduras, was a triumph for NicaraguanPresident Daniel Ortega. He said the accord brought Nicaragua ``tothe gates of peace'' but the nation could not ``let down its guarduntil the Contras are disbanded.''   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater saidthe Bush administration is ``generally supportive'' of the accordbut is skeptical of Nicaragua's commitment to democratic reforms.He said it was up to the Contras to decide to remain a fightingforce if they don't like the plan to disband them.   The pact signed by the presidents of Honduras, Nicaragua,Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica calls for disarming anddisbanding 11,000 Contra guerrillas and 12,000 dependents based inHonduras within 120 days _ or Dec. 5.   In return, Nicaragua promised to guarantee democracy, allow theContras to return home, and drop a suit in the world court againstHonduras over the Contra bases.   In El Salvador, government officials and guerrillas praised theaccords Tuesday and said they could contribute to the quest to endthe 10-year-old war there.   The rebels' Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said overits clandesdtine radio station it ``vigorously applauds'' theagreement. It called the accord ``a victory for revolutionary,progressive, independent and democratic forces of the region.''   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani said he was pleased withthe result of the summit and underscored what he said was Ortega'scommitment to halt Nicarguan support for the Salvadoran rebels..   Sources close to the talks in Tela said U.S. Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III had pressed for a delay until after Nicaragua'sleftist government holds elections scheduled for February.   But Contra sources said the United States had already beentrying to force rebel leaders to give up the fight and join thepolitical process.   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros bitterly called the accord aproduct of ``political confusion'' in Washington.   The Contras began fighting in 1981, accusing the Sandinistas ofbetraying the ideals of the revolution that overthrew PresidentAnastasio Somoza in July 1979. U.S. non-lethal aid continues to therebels, but military aid was suspended in February 1988.   The scale of the fighting since then has declined so much thatthe Sandinista government announced last week it was suspending thedraft.   The agreement calls for a United Nations-organized observercommission. U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said hewas studying the ``long and complex'' agreement.   Bermudez said he would meet with the U.N. commission but norepatriation could take place ``until the Sandinistas show they areheaded toward democracy.''   Ortega has set an election for Feb. 25. Last week he got hisdomestic political opponents to join in a call for disbandment ofthe Contras.   Members of the Nicaragua opposition on Tuesday attributed theaccord to the thaw between Washington and Moscow, saying reducedSoviet support was forcing the Sandinistas to compromise.   ``Neither side is interested in using Third World conflicts toget at the other any more,'' conservative politician Emilio AlvarezMontalvan said in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital.   A source close to President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, who wonthe Nobel Prize for starting the peace process two years ago, saidthe five presidents went ahead with the agreement because they wereconvinced that Nicaragua was serious about democratization.   Arias noted, however, that previous Central American accordsfell apart and urged his fellow presidents to summon the``political will'' needed for compliance.   Honduran political will is a key factor because only theHondurans can cut off the Contras' U.S. supply lifeline to bordercamps.   Honduras has wanted to be rid of the Contra problem ever sinceU.S. military aid was withdrawn but also insists Honduras can enjoypeaceful borders only when Nicaragua becomes a democracy.   Like most Central Americans, the Hondurans are weary of thefighting that has occupied their minds and sapped their economiesfor a decade.   Most commentators in Honduras hailed President Jose Azcona Hoyo,although the conservative newspaper La Prensa called the agreementone-sided: ``It's clear what the Sandinistas got. It's notabsolutely clear what they gave up.''   Bermudez said Contra fighters would face three choices if theaccord goes through: Exile, return to Nicaragua peacefully, or keepfighting inside Nicaragua.   Speaking on condition of anonymity, as did other sources, Contraofficials said they feared some fighters would not give up nomatter what and would return to Nicaragua in small bands that wouldbe massacred by the Sandinista army.   ``In any case, we have to consult the fighting men and see whatthey want to do,'' Bermudez said.   A Contra official said U.S. funding for the group's Miami officewas cut from $262,000 a month to $24,000, with more than 100 peoplelaid off. He accused U.S. officials of trying to force Contraleaders back into Nicaragua. ``We don't have more than five peopleleft,'' said Xavier Arguello, a Contra adviser in Miami.   Staffing at offices in Costa Rica also has been severely cut,Contra officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
