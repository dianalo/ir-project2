LyonsandM;With the unveiling of Intel Corp.'s powerful new 80486 microprocessor thisweek, the software industry falls two silicon generations behind in its raceto keep up with the latest personal computers.andM;Microsoft Corp.'s OS/2, an operating system designed for 80286-based PCs,still hasn't caught on, five years after the first 80286 boxes were shipped.andM;Microsoft doesn't expect OS/2 to catch on until applications are availablefor the Presentation Manager, OS/2's graphical interface.andP;  That will be nextyear -- just as the first 80486 machines are being delivered.andM;Why does software development lag?andP;  Developers certainly don't get a leg upin the natural sequence of events: a new chip, a PC that uses it, anoperating system for the PC, and then applications for the operating system.andO;All these developments take time to unfold.andM;But ''that doesn't explain everything,'' said Mitch Kapor, president of ONTechnology Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.andP;  ''The other thing is that there has beena big consolidation going on among firms in the industry, and there's beenincreased consolidation of control of PCs in the corporate environment, bothof which have slowed down innovation.''andM;Imagine the installed base of 25 million PCs as a big weight that any newsystem must move if it is to be successful.andP;  The last big revolution -- theintroduction of IBM PCs and the DOS operating system -- didn't have much of aweight to budge.andP;  This time the forces working against change are greater.andM;Microsoft officials say they've worked out a plan that will help the softwareindustry catch up with hardware.andP;  They say they'll narrow the gap by writingthe next version of OS/2 so that it will run both 80386 and 80486 systems --in essence, leapfrogging to the 80486.andM;''The '486 is not a lot different from the '386,'' said Steven Ballmer, vicepresident of systems software at Microsoft in Redmond, Wash.andP;  ''Maybe we'lljust do one version that takes care of both.'' Also, Microsoft is reworkingits operating-system code into C language.andP;  ''Then it becomes easier to tracknew chips,'' Ballmer said.andM;This still doesn't address the problem of developing applications, which isbecoming more acute as PC applications become more complex.andP;  Delays inproduct development at Lotus Development Corp. and Ashton-Tate have shownthat writing software is still more of an art than a science, with developersunable to give accurate predictions of how long a project will take.andM;''If you actually look at the way people write software, it's handcrafted,''Kapor said.andP;  ''It's still medieval -- artisans weaving tapestries one threadat a  time.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
