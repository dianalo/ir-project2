Background</ITAG>The Safe Drinking Water Act (``SDWA'' or ``Act'') (42 U.S.C. 300f, <T3>et seq.</T3>) was passed in 1974. The Act required EPA to establishnational interim primary drinking water regulations (NIPDWRs) that appliedto public drinking water systems and that ``specifies contaminants which,in the judgment of the Administrator, may have any adverse effect on thehealth of persons'' [section 1401(1)]. The NIPDWRs were to be revised basedupon a comprehensive assessment of potential adverse effects of contaminantsin drinking water. In the course of developing the revised regulations,EPA was to publish recommended maximum contaminant levels (RMCLs).The Act was amended in 1986. RMCLs were renamed ``maximum contaminant levelgoals'' (MCLGs) without changing the definition. The amended Act specifiesa list of 83 specific drinking water contaminants for which EPA must publishMCLGs and promulgate National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWRs)on a specified schedule (``list of 83 contaminants''; see Appendix A) [section1412(b)(1)].Under the Act, EPA may make up to seven substitutions to the list of 83contaminants [section 1412(b)(2)]. In order to make substitutions to thelist, the Administrator must determine (after notice and opportunity forcomment) that ``regulation of the substitutes * * * is more likely to beprotective of public health (taking into account the schedule for regulation)* * *'' than regulation of the originally listed contaminants that wouldbe removed from the list of 83 contaminants [<T3>Id.</T3>].The Act also requires EPA to publish a list of additional contaminantsthat are known or anticipated to occur in drinking water and which mayrequire regulation under the Act (``drinking water priority list'' or ``DWPL'')[section 1412(b)(3)]. EPA must publish the first list by January 1, 1988,and subsequent lists every three years thereafter [<T3>Id.</T3>]. EPA must propose NPDWRs for at least 25 contaminants onthe DWPL within 24 months of publication of each triennial list, and promulgate25 NPDWRs within 36 months of publication of each triennial list [<T3>Id.</T3>]. In selecting contaminants for the list, EPA must consider,at a minimum, substances referred to in section 101(14) of the ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLAor ``Superfund'') and pesticides registered under the Federal Insecticide,Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) [section 1412(b)(3)(B)]. As requiredby the Act, EPA formed an advisory group to assist in developing the DWPL.This group is to include, but is not limited to, participants from theNational Toxicology Program and the Environmental Protection Agency's Officesof Drinking Water, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. Ground Water, and SolidWaste and Emergency Response, and other offices deemed appropriate by theAdministrator [<T3>Id.</T3>]. As required by the Act, EPA proposed the list of substitutes(52 FR 25720, July 8, 1987). EPA published a draft DWPL for comment inthe same notice. This notice publishes the final list of substitute contaminants along withthe list of contaminants being replaced and responses to significant commentsreceived [section 1412(b)(2)(B)]. Under the Act, EPA's selection of substitutionsto the list of 83 contaminants is not subject to judicial review [section1412(b)(2)(D)]. This notice also publishes the final DWPL [section 1412(b)(3)(A)].EPA held a public hearing on August 4, 1987 in Washington, DC. In addition,EPA received 22 written comments. The comments received are available inthe public docket. Summaries of the significant comments and the responsesare presented in the text below. Additional responses are in the record.EPA believes that, with the promulgation of regulations for the SDWA listof 83 contaminants (with the seven substitutions), many of the significantdrinking water contaminants will have been regulated. With few exceptions,the remaining anticipated drinking water problems are primarily in thearea of disinfection by-products and pesticides. The triennial DWPL willbe the primary vehicle by which EPA considers substances for future regulation(as noted above, MCLGs and NPDWRs are to be set for at least 25 contaminantsfrom the list every three years).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Substitutes</ITAG>A. Criteria Used to Select Substitute ContaminantsThe criteria which EPA used to select substitute contaminants were describedin detail in the earlier notice (52 FR 25720). As noted above, the 1986amendments to the SDWA allow for substitutions to the list of 83 contaminantsto be regulated if the Administrator determines that regulation of thesubstitutes is more likely to be protective of public health than regulationof the contaminants being replaced. To make this determination, EPA consideredseveral factors associated with both the contaminants to be substitutedand the contaminants being replaced on the list. The most important ofthese factors were the severity of the human health hazards posed by thecontaminants and the occurrence or potential for occurrence of the contaminantsin drinking water. For each contaminant, EPA specifically considered thefollowing:andbullet; Are there sufficient health effects data upon which to selectan MCLG?andbullet; Are there potential adverse health effects from exposure to thecontaminant via ingestion?andbullet; Does the contaminant occur in drinking water? Has the contaminantbeen widely detected in significant frequencies?andbullet; If data on the frequency and nature of contaminants are limited,is there a significant potential for drinking water contamination?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Each of these factors is discussed in more detail in the earlier notice(52 FR 25720).EPA believes it is not appropriate to use any specific formula to applyselection criteria because of the many variables associated with contaminantsin drinking water. Given the variability associated with human health andexposure aspects of drinking water contaminants and the directives of theSDWA, EPA believes the decision criteria must remain flexible, so thata case-by-case decision whether regulation is appropriate can be made foreach contaminant.In reviewing contaminants for possible removal from the list of 83 contaminants,EPA first considered the available health effects data and data on occurrenceor potential occurrence in drinking water. The health information necessaryfor development of national primary drinking water regulations is normallyeither adequate human data or data from an adequate subchronic or chronictoxicity study in an appropriate test animal. For each contaminant reviewed,if such data were available and they suggested that the contaminant wouldnot be expected to cause any adverse health effects, the contaminant wasa candidate for replacement. If no such data were available and none wereexpected to be available in time to be considered in developing regulations,the contaminant was also considered as a candidate for replacement. Inaddition, EPA considered contaminants for removal from the list if theavailable monitoring data indicated little or no occurrence of that contaminantin drinking water supplies and little occurrence in drinking water wasanticipated. All of the contaminants removed from the list have one ormore of these characteristics.EPA evaluated candidates to be substituted onto the list using the samecriteria applied to the candidates for removal from the list. Adequatehealth effects and data on occurrence or anticipated occurrence are availableto demonstrate potential public health risk for all of the contaminantsEPA is substituting on the list. In fact, EPA has already proposed MCLGsfor all of the contaminants proposed for substitution (50 FR 46936, November13, 1985).The following is a summary of the significant public comments EPA receivedon the contaminants proposed to be removed and the contaminants to be substitutedon the list of 83 contaminants and EPA's final action in this notice.<ITAG tagnum="81">Contaminants EPA Proposed to Remove</ITAG>This section addresses the contaminants EPA proposed to remove from thelist of 83 contaminants.<T3>Zinc. </T3>Three commenters supported EPA's proposed removal of zincfrom the list of contaminants to be regulated; no commenters objected.<T3>Response. </T3>No response is necessary. EPA is removing zinc fromthe list of 83 contaminants. <T3>Silver. </T3>Four commenters discussed EPA's proposed removal of silverfrom the list. Three commenters supported the Agency's proposal to removesilver from the list. One commenter objected to this proposal, statingthat silver is associated with multiple toxic effects. In addition, thiscommenter objected to EPA's categorization of argyria as not being an adversehealth effect. <T3>Response. </T3>While it is true that effects from silver other thanargyria have been observed in animal studies, these adverse effects, suchas neurotoxicity, kidney damage, cardiotoxicity, and death, occur at extremelyhigh doses which would not be expected to occur from drinking water exposure.EPA, as stated in the proposal, believes that argyria (a discolorationof the skin associated with more realistic doses) is not as adverse healtheffect since it does not impair functioning of the body or cause otherphysiological problems. In addition, there are no known cases of argyriadue to exposure to silver through drinking water. Therefore, EPA is removingsilver from the list of 83 contaminants. <T3>Aluminum. </T3>Two commenters presented information concerning aluminum.One commenter agreed with EPA that is unlikely that aluminum in drinkingwater will cause health problems. The other commenter thought that thereare sufficient data to indicate that aluminum poses an adverse health effectand that it should be regulated at this time. This commenter stated thatthere is evidence from both human and animal studies that aluminum is associatedwith a variety of central nervous systems (CNS) disorders. <T3>Response. </T3>While EPA acknowledges that it has been suggested thataluminum may be associated with CNS disorders, the data do not indicatea cause-effect relationship. Exposure to aluminum in water is very small(approximately 1 percent of total human exposure), and there is no evidenceat this time that aluminum ingested in water poses a health threat. Therefore,EPA is removing aluminum from the list of 83 contaminants. However, EPAis continuing research on the health effects of aluminum, including participationin international studies, and has placed it on the first DWPL (see below).<T3>Sodium. </T3>Five commenters discussed EPA's proposed removal of sodiumfrom the list. Four commenters thought that the Agency's decision to removesodium from the list was appropriate. One commenter disagreed with theproposal, however, stating that there is a large body of studies whichsupport a correlation between increased dietary sodium intake and elevatedblood pressure. This commenter stated that given that such a large percentageof Americans suffer from hypertension and that so many of the nation'sdrinking water supplies have levels of sodium that contribute to the problem,EPA should not remove sodium from the list of contaminants for regulation.<T3>Response. </T3>There is a significant body of information on the relationshipbetween total sodium intake and hypertension for certain individuals. Drinkingwater supplies can contain sodium at varying levels, with the NationalInorganics and Radionuclides Survey (NIRS) showing a median level of 16.6mg/L. However, the vast majority of sodium intake comes from other sourcesin the diet. The typical American diet contains several thousand milligramsper day of sodium, and the contribution from drinking water is unlikelyto exceed a few percent of that total intake. To assist those who, formedical reasons, require a restricted-sodium diet, EPA recommends a sodiumlimit in drinking water of 20 mg/L (45 FR 57332, August 27, 1980). Forpersons on the most restrictive sodium diet, 20 mg/L would likely representless than 10 percent of their total recommended sodium intake, approximately400 mg/day (American Heart Association, see 50 FR 46980, August 27, 1980).There is currently an EPA regulation requiring all public water suppliesto monitor the sodium levels in their drinking water and to report thelevel to local health authorities (40 CFR 141.41). Thus, physicians treatingindividuals on sodium restricted diets may determine the sodium levelsin drinking water and advise their patients accordingly. The patients maythen adjust their total sodium intake accordingly. Regarding the relationship between sodium in drinking water and elevatedblood pressure, there is a large amount of epidemiologic data. Most ofthis data consists of studies on school-age children. Based on this data,there is no compelling evidence that sodium levels up to several hundredmg/L significantly affect the blood pressure on school-age children. Indiscussing the possible relationship of sodium in drinking water to bloodpressure, Colditz and Willet (in Calabrese et al., 1985 Proceedings ofConference on Inorganics in Drinking Water and Cardiovascular Disease,Amherst, Massachusetts, May, 1984) concluded that, ``. . . experimentalinterventions on humans have shown small effects of sodium intake on bloodpressure, 0.28 mm Hg/gram sodium (Fitzgibben et al., 1982) and 0.48mm Hg/gramsodium (Luft et al., 1979). In view of this small response, it is not surprisingthat many studies with few subjects have inadequate power to detect thisapparently small effect.'' In addition, referring to studies by Tuthill and Calabrese (1981 DrinkingWater Sodium and Blood Pressure in Children: A Second Look, American Journalof Public Health, 71:722-729) and Gleiberman (1973 Blood Pressure and DietarySalt in Human Populations, Ecology of Food and Nutrition, 2:143-156), Colditzand Willet concluded that, ``the magnitude of the effect of drinking watersodium originally reported is biologically implausible, which adds additionaldoubt regarding the reported association.''Thus, given this inconclusive evidence, and considering that most people'ssodium intake comes from other sources in the diet, EPA believes it isappropriate to remove sodium from the list of 83 contaminants.<T3>Molybdenum. </T3>Two commenters supported EPA's proposed removal ofmolybdenum from the list of contaminants to be regulated. They believedthat molybdenum has not been shown to have adverse health effects at concentrationsfound in drinking water.<T3>Response. </T3>No response is necessary. EPA is removing molybdenumfrom the list of 83 contaminants.<T3>Vanadium. </T3> Two commenters supported EPA's proposed removal ofvanadium from the list, stating that the compound is rarely found in drinkingwater.<T3>Response. </T3>No response is necessary. EPA is removing vanadium fromthe list of 83 contaminants.<T3>Dibromomethane. </T3> No comments were received on dibromomethane.Therefore, EPA is removing dibromomethane from the list of 83 contaminants.<T3>Sulfate. </T3>Three commenters urged EPA to remove sulfate from thelist of 83 substances. These commenters believed that sulfate meets thecriteria concerning potential health effects and occurrence of the contaminantthat EPA established for selecting substitutes.<T3>Response. </T3>While EPA agrees that there are not a great deal ofdata concerning the health risks from exposure to sulfate in drinking water,EPA believes that there is sufficient information to indicate that transientexposure to sulfate may result in adverse health effects (i.e., diarrheaand dehydration) at levels found in drinking water (see the Criteria Documenton Sulfate). In addition, sulfate commonly occurs in drinking water. Thus,EPA is not removing sulfate from the list of 83 contaminants.<ITAG tagnum="81">Additional Contaminants Suggested for Removal</ITAG>This section addresses the contaminants that commenters requested EPA toremove from the list of 83 contaminants in place of the seven EPA proposedto remove.<T3>Phthalates. </T3>One commenter stated that butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP)should not be included on a general listing of phthalates for regulationsince, unlike other phthalates, BBP has not been found in hazardous wastesites and BBP has not been shown to be teratogenic, genotoxic or neurotoxic.Another commenter thought that EPA should remove all phthalates from thelist based upon the absence of human cancer risk from exposure to diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) in drinking water and the lack of occurrence of phthalatesin drinking water.<T3>Response. </T3>The Agency believes that BBP and DEHP are the phthalatesof health concern. The Agency has concluded that BBP is a possible humancarcinogen (Group C) and concern over the possible health effects of BBPhas led the National Toxicology Program to schedule additional carcinogenicitystudies on this chemical. The Agency will consider the results of thesestudies, when available, along with all other available data in regulatingBBP. In addition, DEHP currently is classified as a probable human carcinogen(Group B2).EPA agrees that the occurrence of phthalates in drinking water at significantlevels is likely to be rare. However, EPA believes that there is sufficientevidence concerning the health effects of these compounds to warrant theirregulation. Therefore, EPA is not removing phthalates from the list of83 contaminants. However, EPA will consider regulating these two phthalatecompounds only, rather than all phthalates, as a category.<T3>Glyphosate. </T3>One commenter suggested that EPA remove glyphosatefrom the list of 83 contaminants because: (1) Glyphosate has not been detectedin drinking water and is unlikely to reach public water supply wells, and(2) glyphosate causes minimal signs of toxicity and then only at very highconcentrations.<T3>Response. </T3>EPA agrees with the commenter that glyphosate is nota high priority chemical for regulation, due to health and occurrence considerations.However, glyphosate is a widely used, nonselective herbicide for the controlof grasses and weeds. Therefore, EPA believes that, due to the high usageof the compound, the potential for contamination of drinking water exists;data from future studies may well indicate contamination from this chemical.EPA recognizes that the toxicity of glyphosate is low, with adverse healtheffects evident only at relatively high doses. However, adverse effectshave been demonstrated; in a three-generation rat reproduction study, renaltubular dilation was found in kidneys of male pups. NTP has selected glyphosatefor in-depth toxicological evaluation. In addition, EPA is limited to sevensubstitutes; EPA believes that there is a stronger basis for removing theother seven chemicals it is removing instead. Therefore, EPA is not removingglyphosate from the list of 83 contaminants.<T3>Asbestos. </T3>One commenter stated that asbestos should be deletedfrom the list of 83 contaminants because, ``the studies conducted to datedo not provide any convincing evidence of an association between asbestosin public water supplies and cancer induction.'' <T3>Response: </T3>EPA disagrees. Although most of the carcinogenicitydata on ingested asbestos fibers is negative, there is some evidence thatasbestos fibers of lengths greater than 10 um may be carcinogenic to animalsthrough ingestion exposure. In addition, there is potential for drinkingwater contamination from natural sources of asbestos and from asbestos-cementpipe which is commonly used in public water supply systems. Such contaminationhas been demonstrated. A NPDWR would limit exposure to asbestos. Therefore,EPA is not removing asbestos from the list of 83 contaminants. <T3>Beryllium. </T3>One commenter thought that beryllium should be removedfrom the list of 83 contaminants. The major reason stated was that ``thereare no significant risks to human health from the ingestion of beryllium,and this is particularly true with respect to potential exposures at thelevels in which beryllium is found in drinking water.'' <T3>Response: </T3>Beryllium has been associated with an increased riskof cancer in animals exposed via inhalation and injection. While the totalityof ingestion studies do not support a link between ingestion of berylliumand cancer, there is a rat study which showed a possible increase in lungcancer after ingestion of beryllium in drinking water. Results of mutagenicitystudies were positive and contact dermatitis has been demonstrated withdermal exposure. Beryllium was detected in 0.3 percent of the sites studiedin the NIRS. Because there is equivocal evidence regarding the carcinogenicityof beryllium from oral exposure, EPA believes that beryllium should notbe removed from the list of 83 contaminants. Accordingly, beryllium remainson the list. <T3>Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC). </T3>One commenter urged EPA to deleteHPC from the list of 83 contaminants to be regulated based on a perceivedlack of data regarding the correlation between HPC levels and waterbornedisease. The commenter especially questioned the link between opportunistic pathogensin drinking water and nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections. In addition,this commenter stated that HPC measurement requirements should not be includedin the monitoring requirements for total coliforms since EPA's contentionthat high HPC levels interfere with the laboratory enumeration of coliformbacteria is not justified by the data presented in the literature. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA believes that it would be inappropriate to removeHPC from the list of 83 contaminants, and, in fact, the Agency has incorporatedcertain HPC requirements in the proposed NPDWR for total coliforms (52FR 42224, November 3, 1987). The data do support the contention that highHPC levels interfere with enumeration of coliform bacteria (see the CriteriaDocument for Heterotrophic Bacteria). Although no strong association hasyet been demonstrated between the density of heterotrophic bacteria indrinking water and the rate of waterborne disease outbreaks, it is knownthat a number of species of heterotrophic bacteria implicated in humandisease can often be found in drinking water. In addition, heterotrophicplate count, a measure of heterotrophic bacteria, is widely used as anindicator of the quality of treatment of drinking water by the drinkingwater industry. Therefore, EPA is retaining HPC on the list of 83 contaminants.  <T3>Additional contaminants. </T3>Two commenters stated that the followingcontaminants do not meet the criteria established for regulation and, therefore,EPA should consider them for removal from the list of 83 contaminants:inorganic mercury, cyanide, acrylamide, 2,4-D, epichlorohydrin, PCBs, pentachlorophenol,<T3>Legionellae, Giardia,</T3> viruses, and total coliforms.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA believes that the above contaminants meet the criteriaestablished for regulation. The commenters provided no data to supporttheir contention that these contaminants should be removed from the listof 83 contaminants. Therefore, these contaminants remain on the list of83 contaminants.<ITAG tagnum="81">Contaminants EPA Proposed to Substitute on the List of 83 Contaminants</ITAG>This section addresses the contaminants EPA proposed to substitute forthe seven contaminants removed from the list of 83 contaminants.<T3>Aldicarb Sulfoxide and Aldicarb Sulfone.</T3> Two commenters addressedthe proposed substitution of aldicarb sulfoxide and aldicarb sulfone onthe list of 83 contaminants. One commenter supported EPA's proposal. Theother commenter thought that EPA should address these two contaminants(and aldicarb, which is already on the list of 83 contaminants) as a groupwith one MCLG and NPDWR.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA believes that it is appropriate to regulate aldicarb,aldicarb sulfoxide, and aldicarb sulfone separately. These are three distinctchemicals. Both aldicarb and aldicarb sulfone are individual pesticidesused for pest control and aldicarb sulfoxide is a transformation productof aldicarb. These three compounds do not always appear together. In addition,the toxicity of these chemicals is not identical. Therefore, EPA is substitutingaldicarb sulfoxide and aldicarb sulfone and listing them separately.<T3>Ethylbenzene. </T3>Two commenters stated that ethylbenzene should notbe substituted on the list of 83 contaminants due to limited occurrence.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA believes that there is a potential for contaminationfrom ethylbenzene because the compound has been detected at 111 hazardouswaste sites and in the aquifer in at least one of these sites. Therefore,EPA is substituting ethylbenzene on the list of 83 contaminants.<T3>Heptachlor and Heptachlor Epoxide.</T3> Two commenters addressed theproposed substitution of heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide in the listof 83 contaminants. One commenter stated that these chemicals should notbe regulated due to their low occurrence and the other commenter thoughtthat these two contaminants should be listed and regulated as a singlecontaminant.<T3>Response: </T3>Heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide have been detectedin drinking water and at seven hazardous waste sites in several states.Thus, EPA believes there is sufficient occurrence and potential for occurrenceto warrant regulation.EPA believes that it is appropriate to regulate heptachlor and heptachlorepoxide separately since these are distinct chemicals and the two compoundshave been shown to have relatively different toxicities in animal studies.In addition, the two compounds are not always detected together. Therefore,EPA is substituting both chemicals on the list of 83 contaminants.<T3>Nitrite.</T3> Two commenters stated that nitrite should not be substitutedon the list of 83 contaminants. One commenter stated that nitrite's instabilityin public water supplies makes the need for regulation questionable. Thiscommenter also questioned whether there has been any documented evidenceof nitrite in drinking water supplies being the cause of methemoglobinemiain infants. The other commenter believed that the occurrence data for nitritedid not warrant regulation.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA is not aware of any cases of methemoglobinemia ininfants due to consumption of nitrite in a public water supply. However,as it is clear that the toxicity of nitrate is due to the conversion ofnitrate to nitrite in the human body, EPA believes that a nitrite standard(in addition to a nitrate standard which EPA has already proposed) is warrantedto protect against the possible conversion of nitrate to nitrite in publicwater supplies (in drinking water, under anaerobic reducing conditionsin the presence of certain bacteria, nitrate can be reduced to nitrite).EPA is aware that limited monitoring data are available for nitrite indrinking water. This is because water that is disinfected contains onlynitrate and most monitoring data have been gathered from disinfected systems.However, EPA believes that a standard for nitrite is warranted, especiallysince many groundwater systems are anaerobic and many remain undisinfected.While EPA's proposed disinfection regulations would require most systemsto disinfect, a number of systems will likely receive variances from therequirement. Therefore, EPA is substituting nitrite on the list of 83 contaminants.<T3>Styrene.</T3> One commenter stated that the occurrence data on styreneis not sufficient to warrant regulation.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA recognizes that styrene has historically been infrequentlyfound in drinking water. However, this may be, in part, due to analyticaland sample preservation difficulties.Considering the high production levels, the fact that it is a frequentcontaminant of resins commonly used in water treatment, and the fact thatit has been frequently detected at hazardous waste sites, indicating thepotential for groundwater contamination, EPA believes that regulation isjustified. Thus, EPA is substituting styrene on the list of 83 contaminants.B.

There are adequate health effects and occurrence datato demonstrate that these seven contaminants have a greater potential topose public health risks than the contaminants EPA is removing from thelist of 83 contaminants. This information is presented in detail in theNovember 13, 1985 notice (50 FR 46936) and in the July 8, 1987 proposal(52 FR 25270). Detailed technical data on these contaminants, includinghealth effects criteria documents, are available for each contaminant andcan be found in the docket for the November 1985 proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Drinking Water Priority List</ITAG>A. Contaminants Considered for the Drinking Water Priority ListAs described earlier, the Safe Drinking Water Act requires EPA to compilea priority list of contaminants (``Drinking Water Priority List'' or ``DWPL'').EPA is to publish this list by January 1, 1988 (and a new list every threeyears thereafter) [section 1412(b)(3)(A)]. EPA must propose MCLGs and NPDWRsfor 25 contaminants on the DWPL within two years after publishing it [section1412(b)(3)(C)] and publish 25 MCLGs and NPDWRs for these contaminants withinthree years [section 1412(b)(3)(D)]. To establish the DWPL, the Act specifiesthat:andbullet; Each contaminant removed from the list of 83 contaminants specifiedin the SDWA and replaced with another must be included on the DWPL [section1412(b)(2)(C)].andbullet; The DWPL must contain substances which are known or anticipatedto occur in public water systems, and which may require regulation underthe Act (e.g., may have any adverse effect on the health of persons) [section1412(b)(3)(A)].andbullet; EPA must consider certain lists of substances in compiling theDWPL [section 1412(b)(3)(B)]. These are:<ITAG tagnum="15">_``Hazardous substances,'' as defined in CERCLA, section 101(14);and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Pesticides registered under FIFRA.</ITAG>andbullet; The Agency must form an advisory working group including membersfrom the National Toxicology Program and EPA's Offices of Drinking Water,Pesticides, Toxic Substances, Ground Water, Solid Waste and Emergency Response,and any other members the Administrator deems appropriate to assist indeveloping the DWPL [section 1412(b)(3)(B)].Based on the requirements of the SDWA and the statutory timeframe for rulemaking(i.e., 25 contaminants on the list are to be regulated within three yearsof publication of the DWPL), EPA used the following general criteria toselect substances for the first DWPL:1. The contaminant must occur in public water systems, or its characteristicsor use patterns must be such that it has strong potential to occur in publicwater systems at levels of concern.2. The contaminant must have a documented or suspected adverse human healtheffect.3. There must be sufficient information available on the contaminant (includinghealth effects data, analytical methods, and treatability studies) so thata regulation could likely be developed within the statutory timeframe.Substances for which insufficient information to regulate in the next threeyears is available will be candidates for subsequent DWPLs (to be publishedtriennially, beginning in 1991).In general, EPA sought to select substances for the first DWPL which representa significant cross-section of the most important or potentially importantdrinking water contaminants. To achieve that end, EPA applied the abovecriteria to the following groups of contaminants to derive the first DWPL:Group 1: The seven contaminants proposed for removal from the statutorylist of 83 contaminants that EPA is to regulate by June, 1989 (the Actrequires EPA to include these contaminants on the DWPL, regardless of theapplication of the above criteria [section 1412(b)(2)(C)]);Group 2: Disinfectants and contaminants formed as a result of the disinfectionprocess (``disinfection by-products'');Group 3: The first 50 contaminants on the priority list that EPA is requiredto compile under section 110 of the Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct of 1986 (SARA);Group 4: Design-analytes of the EPA National Pesticides Survey (NPS) andpesticides reported to be present in drinking water in certain federaland state surveys;Group 5: Unregulated contaminants to be monitored under section 1445 ofthe SDWA; andGroup 6: Certain other substances reported frequently and/or at high concentrationsin other recent surveys.Several commenters expressed concern that the DWPL may become inflexibleand that contaminants, once listed, may not be deleted even when EPA determinesthat there is no merit to regulating the contaminant. This is not EPA'sintent. The DWPL is a flexible tool which is reviewed and revised everythree years. Substances from previous lists that are not regulated neednot be automatically included on subsequent lists. EPA believes that itwas the clear intent of Congress that the DWPL be simply a ``candidate''list for regulation consisting of substances which EPA believes may posea threat to drinking water and that ``<T3>may</T3> require regulation under the Act'' (emphasis added). Somesubstances are placed on the list because they clearly present risks; othersare placed on the list for further investigation to determine the needfor regulation. After listing, EPA will determine which substances (noless than 25) require regulation. Hence, there is no separate officialprocedure for ``delisting'' substances from the DWPL; rather, each newtriennial DWPL is independently constituted, with unregulated contaminantscarried over from previous lists only as determined necessary by EPA.Several commenters questioned the advisability of listing substances whichhave not been demonstrated to contaminate public water supplies. The SDWArequires EPA to consider for the list substances which are ``known or <T3>anticipated </T3>to occur in drinking water * * *.'' (emphasis added).Each of the groups of contaminants evaluated for inclusion on the DWPLcontains both substances which are known to occur in public water suppliesand substances which, for the reasons stated below, are anticipated tooccur in public water supply. EPA's selection of significant environmentalcontaminants (as determined under various EPA programs), and contaminantswhich have been demonstrated to be potential problems in research studies,meets the statutory standard.EPA discussed its specific rationale for selecting these particular groupsof substances as candidates for the DWPL in the July 1987 notice (52 FR25720). The significant public comments received, and EPA's final selectionsfor inclusion on the first DWPL, are presented below.<ITAG tagnum="81">Group 1: Substitutes From the SDWA List of 83 Contaminants</ITAG>As described above, EPA has removed seven substances from the statutorylist of 83 contaminants which EPA is required by the SDWA to regulate.EPA is including these seven contaminants on the first DWPL, as requiredby the Act. Public comments relating to the selection of these seven contaminantsare summarized and addressed earlier in this notice. The seven contaminantsare:<ITAG tagnum="15">Zinc</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Silver</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Aluminum</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Sodium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Dibromomethane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Molybdenum</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Vanadium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Group 2: Disinfectants and Their By-Products</ITAG>Chlorination is the most widely used method of disinfecting drinking waterin the United States. It is convenient to use, effective in destroyingor inactivating pathogens, and continues to disinfect in the distributionsystem. Other disinfectants include chlorine dioxide, chloramine, ammonia,and ozone. Congress has mandated that EPA promulgate regulations requiringdisinfection as a treatment technique requirement for all public watersystems (unless they obtain a variance or exemption) by June, 1989 [section1412(b)(8)]. EPA has already proposed the disinfection requirement forsurface water supplies (52 FR 42178, November 3, 1987). For ground-watersupplies, EPA plans to combine the disinfection requirement with regulationslimiting disinfectant levels and levels of their toxic by-products. Therefore,EPA is placing the disinfectants and disinfectant by-products listed inTable 1 on the first DWPL. A complete discussion of the rationale for selectingspecific substances in this group appears in the July 1987 notice (52 FR25720). In today's notice, EPA has added chlorate and cyanogen chlorideto the list in the July 1987 notice. These were not included on the listin the proposal, because of possible analytical methodology problems (July1987 notice). However, EPA believes that an acceptable method is availablefor cyanogen chloride and that it is likely that methods will be availablefor chlorate by 1991 when EPA must promulgate regulations for 25 contaminantson the DWPL.A number of commenters expressed concern about listing disinfectants onthe DWPL, stating that these chemicals are beneficial and that EPA is likelyto require their use in future regulations. Although EPA has proposed torequire that surface water systems disinfect their water supplies (see52 FR 42178, November 3, 1987), and the Agency plans to require many groundwater systems to disinfect as well, EPA does not expect to specify whichparticular disinfectant must be used. Instead, EPA will provide a listof several disinfectants and appropriate concentrations. Some disinfectantsare suspected or known human toxicants at certain dose levels. EPA is conductinga significant amount of research on the health effects of disinfectantsat various concentrations. EPA strongly believes that the primary potentialthreat to public health from drinking water is disease caused by microbiologicalcontamination and that disinfection is the most appropriate means of protectingthe public from these risks. Yet some limits on the concentration of disinfectantsthat the public consumes may be necessary in order to protect the publicfrom certain other potential health effects. EPA will consider both ofthese risks when regulating these substances.EPA is conducting research on the occurrence, identification, and healtheffects of ozone by-products. Few of the by-products have been conclusivelyidentified. However, as one commenter pointed out, while ozone is not likelyto be present in water delivered to users in ozonated systems, ozone by-productsare. Therefore, EPA is placing ozone by-products on the DWPL rather thanozone itself.Some commenters suggested that analytical methodologies were not sufficientlyavailable for many of the disinfection by-products listed. For severalyears, EPA has been conducting research on measuring the listed by-products.Several methods are currently being tested in the laboratory and fieldand are expected to be ready in time for promulgation of regulations forthese contaminants by 1991. In addition, it is important to note that EPAalso has the authority to regulate substances for which no analytical methodis available by promulgating a treatment technique requirement under sections1401(1)(D) and 1412(b)(7) of the SDWA. Because of the relationship betweenrequired disinfection and regulated by-products, some type of treatmenttechnique requirement may be appropriate.EPA believes that consumers are likely to be exposed to the listed disinfectantsand by-products of those disinfectants; available information indicatesthat the selected by-products are a useful subset of the by-products thatpeople are exposed to most and which may present health concerns. Manyof the listed disinfection by-products occur frequently in drinking waterand generally are found at higher concentrations than those not listedand which have been detected but not at frequent or high levels. Furthermore,EPA believes that the listed by-products can be controlled, and that theircontrol will also limit exposure to related by-products.EPA currently regulates four of the principal trihalomethane disinfectantby-products under one regulation (44 CFR 141.12). In addition, certaincontaminants are listed by group (and presumably may be regulated by group)on the statutory list of 83 contaminants EPA is to regulate by June, 1989(i.e., PAHs, PCBs, Phthalates, Adipates, Toxaphene, Viruses, and Totalcoliforms). As described in the July 1987 notice, EPA may regulate otherdisinfection by-products in groups also, in part because reduction of certainby-products or classes of by-products often results in the reduction ofother by-products as well. In addition, the analyses of samples for thesesubstances can often be performed together. Therefore, for listing on theDWPL, EPA has consolidated certain by-products into contaminant-groupsor contaminant-classes, which are listed in Table 1. EPA will determinewhich contaminants, including THMs, require individual regulations andwhich should be regulated as a group, as in the current THM regulation.Listing by groups will allow EPA to regulate some or all of the contaminant-classeslisted in Table 1, as well as any specific substances in these groups.Each regulated contaminant or contaminant group will count toward the minimumof 25 substances that must be regulated under the Act. If EPA individuallyregulates certain contaminants in a listed contaminant group, EPA willcount each individual contaminant, rather than the group, toward the minimumof 25 required regulations. Because of the significance of exposure tothe intentionally added disinfectants themselves, they are listed separately.Unlike the July 1987 proposal, this final DWPL lists the various halonitrilesand trihalomethanes individually.<ITAG tagnum="84">Table 1._Disinfectants and Disinfection By-Products  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chlorine  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Hypochlorite  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chlorine dioxide  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chlorate  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chlorite  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chloramine  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Ammonia  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Ozone by-products  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chloroform  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Bromodichloromethane  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chlorodibromomethane  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Bromoform  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Dichloroacetonitrile  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Dibromoacetonitrile  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Bromochloroacetonitrile  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Trichloroacetonitrile  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Halogenated Acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and other nitriles </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chloropicrin  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Cyanogen chloride  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Group 3: SARA Priority List  </ITAG>The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, [Pub. L. 99-499(SARA)], amended CERCLA [42 U.S.C. 9601 <T3>et seq.</T3>]. SARA requires the Agency for Toxic Substances and DiseaseRegistry (ATSDR) of the Department of Health and Human Services and EPAto prepare a priority-ordered list of hazardous substances covered by CERCLAwhich are most commonly found at hazardous waste sites on the CERCLA NationalPriority List (NPL), and which the agencies determine pose the most significantpotential threat to human health. The two agencies must base their determinationof the potential human health threat posed by these substances on theirknown or suspected toxicity to humans and the potential for human exposureto such substances. The first list of 100 substances was published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 17, 1987 (52 FR 12866).  ATSDR and EPA used three criteria for determining the degree to which eachsubstance poses a potential human health risk: (1) Chemical toxicity; (2)frequency of occurrence of chemicals at NPL sites or certain other facilities;and (3) potential for human exposure to the substances (Final Support Documentfor the SARA List, U.S.E.P.A., 1987).  The list of 100 substances was separated into four priority groups of 25substances each. The first group of 25 is the highest priority group, thesecond is the next highest priority, and so on. For a complete discussionof the basis and development of the SARA section 110 priority list, see52 FR 12866, the background document on the SARA section 110 list, andthe July 1987 notice (52 FR 25720).  EPA used modified Reportable Quantity (RQ) determinations when rankingthe toxicity of the candidates for the SARA priority list. EPA has promulgatedRQ values for most CERCLA section 101(14) hazardous substances, and mostof the substances were considered in developing the SARA section 110 prioritylist. Accordingly, EPA believes that using the SARA section 110 list inthe development of the first DWPL fulfills the SDWA requirement to considerCERCLA section 101(14) substances. In addition, the basic analyte listfor the laboratory program which generated the site-specific data usedin estimating the potential for human exposure to various contaminantsat NPL sites was the Priority Pollutant list compiled under section 307(a)of the Clean Water Act. EPA has reviewed the findings from Agency-sponsoreddata-gathering projects at specific surface water supplies. These surfacewater data indicate that nearly all substances that were found at concentrationsgreater than one part per billion have already been considered by EPA inthe development of the DWPL. Therefore, EPA believes that, by using theSARA section 110 list in the manner described in the July 1987 notice (52FR 25720), the Agency has considered the key substances that are likelyto be of concern in public water systems both from waste disposal and fromother releases to surface and ground waters.            EPA has decided to consider the two highest priority groupings of chemicalsunder SARA for the DWPL. As a group, these fifty priority substances presentthe most significant concerns at Superfund sites and, hence, may pose significantrisks of exposure via drinking water supplies. Furthermore, these two groupsalso include all substances on the SARA list with an RQ value of less than10 pounds (the more toxic the substance, the lower the RQ number). EPA has deleted from the list of fifty high priority SARA substances allsubstances which are included in the statutory list of 83 contaminantswhich EPA is to regulate under the SDWA. The remaining substances to beconsidered for inclusion on the DEPL appear in Table 2. These substanceswhich are included in one or more Tables in this section have not beendeleted from Table 2. EPA will consider substances from the second groupof fifty on the SARA section 110 list for listing on the next DWPL, whichthe Agency must publish by January 1, 1991. Because use of the SARA section110 list necessarily excludes consideration of certain additional CERCLAsection 101(14) substances, i.e., those for which the RQ is based on theResource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste characteristics(e.g., ignitability, reactivity, aquatic toxicity), EPA intends to evaluatethe remaining section 101(14) substances, as well as other substances onvarious lists established by the Agency pursuant to legislative mandate,in the course of developing subsequent DWPLs. <ITAG tagnum="85">Table 2._Substances on the SARA Section 110 Priority List (From theFirst Two Priority Subgroups) Not Included in the Statutory List of 83Compounds Required to be Regulated by EPA </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Dieldrin/Aldrin</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chloroform</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Heptachlor/Heptachlor epoxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">N-nitrosodiphenylamine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">N-nitrosodimethylamine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">4,4andmin16;-DDE,DDT,DDD</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chloroethane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Bromodichloromethane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Isophorone</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1,1,2,2,-Tetrachloroethane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">3,3andmin16;-Dichlorobenzidine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Benzidine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Phenol</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Bis(2-chloroethyl)ether</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2,4-Dinitrotoluene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Bis(chloromethyl)ether</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Group 4: Pesticides Registered Under FIFRA</ITAG>The National Pesticides Survey (NPS) is a joint venture of the Office ofDrinking Water and the Office of Pesticide Programs. The purpose of thissurvey and the criteria used to select analytes for the NPS makes theseanalytes logical candidates for inclusion on the DWPL from the universeof pesticides regulated by EPA. As described in the July 1987 notice, EPA selected the design-analytesfor the NPS from pesticide chemicals which are either known to have occurredin groundwater as a result of agricultural uses, have certain physical/chemicalcharacteristics which make them likely to end up in drinking water supplies,such as high water solubility, or are members of potential problem classesof chemicals with potential risks, such as triazines, substituted ureas,carbamates, substituted acetanilides, and aromatic acids. Also, EPA includednematocides because, in general, they are mobile, persistent, and are applieddirectly to the soil. In the NPS, EPA will also analyze for other pesticidesthat are quantifiable under an analytical method already being employedfor a design analyte. While the NPS selection scheme, unlike the SARA section110 priority list ranking scheme, did not explicitly consider toxicity,EPA is assuming, for purposes of developing this DWPL, that all of theanalyte pesticides are of sufficient toxicity to be considered for listingon the DWPL. EPA believes this is a reasonable assumption, consideringthat pesticides are specifically developed for their toxicity to certainorganisms.

Section 1445 requiresEPA to publish a list of unregulated contaminants (i.e., contaminants forwhich there is no national primary drinking water regulation specifyingan MCL or treatment technique requirement). Generally, each system mustmonitor for each contaminant on the list once every five years unless theAdministrator requires more frequent monitoring. EPA promulgated monitoringrequirements for 51 unregulated volatile organic contaminants (VOCs) onJuly 8, 1987 (52 FR 25690). These contaminants were generally selectedbased on their capability of being detected by the methodology specifiedin the July 1987 NPDWRs for eight VOCs.In developing the monitoring requirements for these 51 unregulated VOCs,EPA evaluated the likelihood of widespread occurrence, the cost of monitoring,the availability of reliable analytical methods, the availability of laboratoriesto perform these analyses, and the experience of EPA and several Statesin conducting monitoring surveys. A more complete discussion of these analysesappears in the notice promulgating the monitoring requirements (52 FR 25690)and the July 1987 notice proposing the first DWPL (52 FR 25720).In the monitoring regulations for the 51 unregulated contaminants (52 FR25690), these volatile organic chemicals are divided into three categories.EPA is including, on the first DWPL, the unregulated contaminants listedin Categories 1 and 2 (see 52 FR 25690, July 8, 1987). These are the substancesfor which all systems (in the case of Category 1) or many systems (in thecase of Category 2) will be monitoring in the next five years. It is likelythat States will not require many systems to monitor for Category 3 VOCs(unless their supplies are particularly vulnerable to contamination bythese VOCs), so EPA is not including them on the first DWPL. EPA believesthat compliance data on the eight regulated VOCs and monitoring data forthe VOCs in the two categories of unregulated VOCs will not only identifythe VOCs that appear in drinking water, but also provide a useful surrogatefor industrial contamination in general.Some of the 35 contaminants in these two categories are already includedin the statutory list of 83 contaminants EPA is to regulate under the SDWA.EPA considered the remaining contaminants for listing on the DWPL. Theyare listed in Table 4.

While EPA believes that these substances are notlikely to pose a significant health threat to consumers of water from publicwater systems, EPA is including these two substances on the first DWPLbecause the Agency plans to evaluate the need for MCLGs and NPDWRs forthese contaminants.<T3>Cryptosporidium</T3> is a protozoan which has recently been identifiedas a waterborne disease agent. In 1984, it was implicated in a diseaseoutbreak in Texas, in which 117 cases of gastroenteritis were reported.The community in question was supplied by groundwater, and treatment wasidentified as being deficient (CDC, 1985). Another reported waterbornedisease outbreak occurred in January 1987 in Carrollton, Georgia. Over20,000 cases were reported. Although some protection from <T3>Cryptosporidium</T3> would be provided by compliance with the proposedfiltration and disinfection rules published on November 3, 1987 (52 FR42178), EPA is including <T3>Cryptosporidium</T3> on the first DWPL, because the Agency plans todetermine whether specific regulation of this contaminant is necessary.For a more complete discussion of the rationale for this selection, seethe July 1987 notice.One commenter suggested that ``corrosivity'' be added to the DWPL. Corrosivityitself is not toxic, but the corrosivity of water generally indicates thepotential for the water to leach lead, copper, asbestos, and other toxicsubstances from distribution and plumbing systems. Corrosivity is alreadycovered in the National Secondary Drinking Water Regulations. When EPApromulgates NPDWRs for corrosion byproduct chemicals, the regulations willbe based, in part, on corrosion control.One State commented that EPA should consider the regulatory agendas ofthe States when choosing substances for the DWPL. The commenter provideda survey of state regulatory activities. EPA has incorporated many of thesurvey's recommendations in the final DWPL. For instance, as describedbelow, EPA has added several pesticides to the DWPL that EPA did not includein the proposed DWPL because of perceived data gaps.B. Contaminants Considered for the Drinking Water Priority List but Deleteddue to Lack of Exposure or Data Availability<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Exposure Potential and/or Physical-chemical Properties</ITAG>EPA stated in the July 1987 notice (52 FR 25720) that it believes thatthere is little or no potential for either adverse health effects or exposurethrough drinking water to certain candidates for the DWPL because of physical-chemicalproperties or other reasons. Having received no comments on this conclusionand no countervailing data since proposal, EPA is therefore not includingthe following substances on the DWPL:<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Aldrin/Dieldrin</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; DDT, DDE, and DDD</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Benzidine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; 3,3andmin16;-Dichlorobenzidine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Bis(chloromethyl)ether</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Bis(chloroethyl)ether</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Naphthalene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Acrolein</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Aniline</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Phenol</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; N-nitrosodimethyl amine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">2. Data Availability</ITAG>In the July 1987 notice, EPA proposed to eliminate a number of candidatecontaminants because sufficient data to regulate them is not expected tobe available to the Agency in time to meet the statutory deadline for regulatingcontaminants from this list (i.e., January 1, 1991). Several commentersagreed with the concept of listing substances only when there was a reasonableexpectation that there would be data to write a regulation within threeyears. However, even though there are significant data gaps for most ofthe candidate pesticides, for countervailing reasons (see the July 1987notice), the Agency proposed to include a subset of these pesticides (isophorone,ETU, and 1,3-dichloropropene) on the DWPL, in spite of data availabilityconcerns.C. Contaminants Added to the Drinking Water Priority List<ITAG tagnum="16">1. Pesticides</ITAG>In response to comments, EPA has decided to include on the final DWPL severaladditional pesticides which it did not include on the proposed DWPL becauseof likely data gaps. Several commenters urged EPA to add the pesticidemetolachlor to the DWPL. In addition, a State commenter, which surveyedall the other States, suggested listing several additional pesticides becausethey are of significant concern to many States (i.e., a significant numberof States are writing regulations or developing other restrictions on thesepesticides). Also, the National Drinking Water Advisory Council commentedthat EPA should, ``* * * add a few pesticides for which high occurrencepotential exists, but for which data may not yet be available to set regulations.The DWPL would then serve as a mechanism to accelerate data collectionfor these compounds.'' Based on the comments, EPA believes it is importantto move quickly to develop the necessary information on these chemicalsbecause of the concern they pose. Therefore, EPA has added these pesticidesto the first DWPL:<ITAG tagnum="16">andbullet; Cyanazine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">andbullet; Dicamba</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">andbullet; Metolachlor</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">andbullet; Metribuzin</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">andbullet; Trifluralin</ITAG>EPA will consider for placement of future lists all candidate pesticideswhich it considered including on the first DWPL but did not because ofdata limitations. In addition, if EPA determines that any of these substances,or any other substances, pose a potential risk to public health, the Agencymay regulate those substances whether or not they are on the DWPL.<ITAG tagnum="16">2. Additional Substances</ITAG>EPA is adding methyl-tertiarybutyl-ether (MTBE) to the first DWPL. Thissubstance was not included in the July 1987 notice. However, the Agencyhas recently identified MTBE as a high-risk-chemical for contaminationof drinking water supplies and their sources. MTBE is used widely as agasoline component, and as such is stored, transported, and used all overthe country. MTBE has been detected in a number of groundwaters, probablyas a result of leaking underground storage tanks, disposal facilities,or spills. Manufacturers of MTBE have initiated a battery of toxicologicalevaluations for MTBE. Because of the potential for widespread contamination,EPA is listing MTBE on the first DWPL.D. First Drinking Water Priority ListTable 5 is the final Drinking Water Priority List of 53 contaminants andcontaminant groups. This list is a compilation of substances from the sixgroups discussed in this notice. EPA removed duplicate contaminants andcontaminants that are inappropriate for listing at this time based on exposureconsiderations and/or physical-chemical properties, or lack of data.  <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 5_Priority List of Drinking Water Contaminants</T4><H1>Substance</H1><H1>CAS No.</H1><H1>CAS Name</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,1,2-Tetrachloroethane<D>630206</D><D>Ethane, 1,1,1,2-tetrachloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,2,2,-Tetrachloroethane<D>79345</D><D>Ethane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1-Dichloroethane<D>75343</D><D>Ethane, 1,1-dichloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1-Dichloropropene<D>563586</D><D>1-Propene, 1,1,-dichloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2,3-Trichloropropane<D>96184</D><D>Propane, 1,2,3-trichloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,3-Dichloropropane<D>142289</D><D>Propane, 1,3-dichloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,3-Dichloropropene<D>542756</D><D>1-Propene, 1,3-dichloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,2-Dichloropropane<D>594207</D><D>Propane, 2,2-dichloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4,5-T<D>93765</D><D>Acetic Acid, (2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-Dinitrotoluene<D>121142</D><D>Benzene, 1-methyl-2,4-dinitro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aluminum<D>7429905</D><D>Aluminum</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ammonia<D>7664417</D><D>Ammonia</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Boron<D>7440428</D><D>Boron</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bromobenzene<D>108861</D><D>Benzene, bromo-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bromochloroacetonitrile<D>83463621</D><D>Acetonitrile, bromochloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bromodichloromethane<D>75274</D><D>Methane, bromodichloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bromoform<D>75252</D><D>Methane, tribromo-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bromomethane<D>74839</D><D>Methane, bromo-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chloramines<D/><D>Chloramides</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chlorate<D>14866683</D><D>Chlorate</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chlorine<D>7782505</D><D>Chlorine</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chlorine dioxide<D>10049044</D><D>Chlorine oxide</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chlroite<D>14998277</D><D>Chlorite</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chloroethane<D>75003</D><D>Ethane, chloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chloroform<D>67663</D><D>Methane, trichloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chloromethane<D>74873</D><D>Methane, chloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chloropicrin<D>76062</D><D>Methane, trichloronitro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cryptosporidium<D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanazine<D>21725462</D><D>Propanenitrile, 2-[[4-chloro-6-(ethylamino)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]amino]-2-methyl-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanogen chloride<D>506774</D><D>Cyanogen chloride</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dibromoacetonitrile<D>3252435</D><D>Acetonitrile, dibromo-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dibromochloromethane<D>124481</D><D>Methane, dibromochloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dibromomethane<D>74953</D><D>Methane, dibromo-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dicamba<D>1918009</D><D>Benzoic acid, 3,6-dichloro-2-methoxy-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dichloroacetonitrile<D>3018120</D><D>Acetonitrile, dichloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">ETU<D>96457</D><D>2-Imidazolidinethione</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hypochlorite ion<D>14380611</D><D>Hypochlorite</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Isophorone<D>78591</D><D>2-Cyclohexen-1-one, 3,5,5-trimethyl-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methyl tert-butyl ether<D>1634044</D><D>Propane, 2-methoxy-2-methyl-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Metolachlor<D>51218452</D><D>Acetamide, 2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxy-1-methylethyl)-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Metribuzin<D>21087649</D><D>1,2,4-Triazin-5(4H)-One,4-amino-6-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-3-(methylthio)-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Molybdenum<D>7439987</D><D>Molybdenum</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ozone byproducts<D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver<D>7440224</D><D>Silver</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sodium<D>7440235</D><D>Sodium</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Strontium<D>7440246</D><D>Strontium</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trichloroacetonitrile<D>545062</D><D>Acetonitrile, trichloro-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trifluralin<D>1582098</D><D>Benzenamine, 2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Vanadium<D>7440622</D><D>Vanadium</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zinc<D>7440666</D><D>Zinc</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">o-Chlorotoluene<D>95498</D><D>Benzene, 1-chloro-2-methyl-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">p-Chlorotoluene<D>106434</D><D>Benzene, 1-chloro-4-methyl-</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Halogenated acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and other nitriles<D/></ITAG></ITAG>E. Future Drinking Water Priority ListsThe six groups of substances described above were the basis for the developmentof the first DWPL.

Other Requirements</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirements of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This notice is not a regulation and will not have a major financial oreconomic impact on any party. Therefore, EPA has not prepared an EconomicImpact Analysis (EIA). EPA will prepare an EIA, if appropriate, at thetime of regulation of any contaminant substituted on the list of 83 contaminantsor listed on the DWPL.The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has reviewed this notice.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) requires EPA to explicitly consider the effect of proposedregulations on small entities. This notice does not promulgate any regulations.Therefore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires no such analysis. AsEPA prepares regulations for contaminants under section 1412 of the SDWAfor substances substituted on the list of 83 contaminants or selected fromthe Drinking Water Priority List, EPA will consider the effect of the proposedregulations on small entities.C. Paperwork Reduction ActThere are no information collection requirements in this notice (44 U.S.C.3501<T3> et seq.</T3>).D. Technical ReviewThe National Drinking Water Advisory Council reviewed the July 1987 proposalat its meeting on November 5-6, 1987 and, ``* * * concurred in the approachused for listing * * * and encouraged EPA to add a few pesticides for whichhigh occurrence potential exists * * * .'' The Council also generally supportedthe Agency's decisions regarding contaminants for removal from the listof 83 and substitutes for those removed.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 13, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.
