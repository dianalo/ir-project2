Suddenly, Cato's dedication to attacking the wayWashington does business is in vogue. James Pinkerton, asenior Bush administration domestic policy planner, says hereads &quot;every one&quot; of Cato's studies. &quot;Cato is on theforefront of a number of policy ideas,&quot; he explains. On theother side of the ideological spectrum, American CivilLiberties Union President Nadine Strossen, whose organizationis considering working with Cato on a privacy study, callsthe institute an &quot;articulate, effective spokesman&quot; foranti-interventionist views.</LP><TEXT>   Anger at the way the two main political parties run thecountry is a way of life at the Cato Institute, which isdedicated to libertarian ideals. Edward Crane, Cato'spresident and founder, abhors what he perceives as thetendency of Republicans and Democrats alike to expandgovernmental intervention, their lip service to economic andsocial liberties notwithstanding.   &quot;There is no area of human activity that is outside thesphere of government encroachment from the politicalperspectives of the leaders of either party,&quot; says Mr. Crane.Cato's simple yet heady goal is to shrink that sphere.   For the past decade Cato has been positioning itself toplay a role in Washington while capitalizing onanti-government feelings. When it moved to the capital fromSan Francisco in 1981, it simultaneously began loosening itsown ties to the Libertarian Party. The previous year, Cato'sMr. Crane had managed the campaign of Ed Clark, the party'spresidential candidate. Now Mr. Crane disavows theLibertarian Party, saying flatly: &quot;They have some very exoticpolicy prescriptions that I simply don't endorse.&quot;   For example, he disagrees with their rejection of nucleardeterrence, their desire to return to the gold standard, andtheir &quot;child rights&quot; plank, which would allow children todrink but also would have them tried as adults for crimes.The split with the party has gone so far that Mr. Crane noweven dislikes being called libertarian, preferring the labels&quot;classical liberalism&quot; or &quot;market liberalism.&quot;   Abandoning the Libertarian Party has been crucial toentering Washington's political mainstream, contends Rep. TomCampbell, who says he has worked closely with Cato on severalissues, such as the budget debate and attempts to limit theregulatory power of the Food and Drug Administration. &quot;To gothe third-party route in Washington is to lose power,&quot; saysthe California Republican.   Cato's stance sets it apart from the three biggestWashington think tanks, which are associated with one partyor the other -- the American Enterprise Institute and theHeritage Foundation with the Republicans, and the BrookingsInstitution with the Democrats. Because Cato's policies don'tconsistently follow either the Republican or Democraticplatforms, the institute is &quot;free to do a lot of independentthinking,&quot; says Rep. Timothy Penny (D., Minn.).   To be sure, Cato's anti-interventionism often places it inthe conservative camp. But unlike, say, the HeritageFoundation, Cato doesn't limit its laissez-faireprescriptions to the marketplace. Cato seeks to removegovernment from people's personal lives as well. One of itsmost controversial proposals, for example, is its call forthe legalization of drugs. Similarly, its positions on gayrights and pornography are more like those of elements of theDemocratic left.   And while Cato may get praise from the White House, Mr.Crane isn't returning the favor. He calls President Bush'srecord &quot;an utter disaster.&quot; Similarly, he remains proud ofCato's stand against the Persian Gulf War, even though ithurt the institute financially by offending somecontributors.   That sort of contrariness continues to build a reputationof integrity that is more valuable than ever in today'satmosphere in Washington. &quot;I opposed their leaving {SanFrancisco} on the grounds that moving to Washington is a surerecipe for getting corrupted,&quot; says Nobel Prize-winningeconomist Milton Friedman, a longtime Cato associate. &quot;So farI've been wrong.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
