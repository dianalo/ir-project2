In a secret ballot, the WHO annual assembly voted 80-49 againstthe Nicaraguan proposal. There were 19 abstentions.   Another proposal to defer the question of PLO admission untilnext year has yet to be voted on. WHO's chief urged delegates tosupport that measure, saying to do otherwise would jeopardize WHO'sfuture.   The United States has threatened to withdraw funding for WHO ifthe Palestinian state declared in November is allowed to become theorganization's 167th member state.   In Paris, a PLO spokesman said the Palestinian group is preparedto finance WHO's Africa operations if the United States carriesthrough on its threat.   A compromise proposal by nine Western and Third World countriescalls for deferring the PLO application until next year whilecalling for more aid to go to residents of the Israeli-occupiedterritories.   WHO Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima, who has urged PLOChairman Yasser Arafat to put off his application, called on theassembly ``not to jeopardize the future of our organization'' andto agree to the compromise.   ``That future is in your hands,'' he told the more than 1,000delegates.   Nicaragua then submitted what it termed ``amendments'' to thecompromise proposal. Those amendments were tantamount to an Arabdraft resolution calling on the assembly to admit the state ofPalestine immediately. They failed in the secret ballot.   The PLO's parliament-in-exile, the Palestine National Council,declared the independent state in November. The PLO, which hasnon-voting status in the U.N. system, is attempting to join all ofthe major U.N. agencies as a full member.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said admitting the PLOwould harm the Middle East peace process and the entire U.N.system. The United States and its Western allies say the nationproclaimed by the PLO does not fulfill internationally acceptedcriteria of statehood, including control of a defined territory anda capital.   The United States has contributed $94 million to WHO's regularbudget and special programs to fight specific diseases.   WHO plays a vital role in assisting governments worldwide tostrengthen their health services and advance work to eradicatediseases, such as AIDS, and to promote health care and nutrition.   In an apparent bid to woo Third World countries to the PLO'sside, PLO spokesman Omar Massalha said in Paris the organizationwould take over funding of African programs in the event of a U.S.withdrawal of aid.   ``The PLO has already put together necessary funding forfinancing the programs and activities of the WHO in Africa in theevent that the United States should suspend its financialcontribution following the admission of the state of Palestine as amember state of WHO,'' Massalha said.   Massalha said the money had been raised from several Arab andnon-aligned countries.</TEXT></DOC>
