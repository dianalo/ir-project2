If the fluctuation on the electricity spot market is normalizedso that incomes to the utilities are equal, a reasonable cost curve results.Pricing based on time differential rate is simpler to introduce thanthat based on cost differential rate, and though in Sweden this has ledto base power capacity being utilized it has also resulted in a greaterrisk of power shortages during peak periods. A meter system is suggested,based on a cost differential rate, where the price level is set remotelyand the consumer is informed of changes. Each customer has his own computerwhich also functions as the load management control panel. Local areacomputers handle specific control problems, such as overload, and alsocustomer charging. The load management function controls the heatingsource, warm water generation. It is suggested that in houses oil fueledboilers should be used for space heating during the winter, and electricheaters during the rest of the year, this would save energy. Other combinationsof energy sources are suggested, all of which systems could be controlledby the meter. (AB).</TEXT></DOC>
