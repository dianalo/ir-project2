However, a GAO report to Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., said therewere ``no major safety, technical or other barriers'' which wouldpreclude the Washington state reactor from being considered as anoption for the next new defense materials production reactor.   The plant, 63 percent complete and owned by the WashingtonPublic Power Supply System, is situated on the Department ofEnergy's Hanford Reservation near Richland, Wash.   In August, Energy Secretary John S. Herrington recommendedconstruction of two new weapons production reactors _ a heavy waterreactor at DOE's Savannah River Plant in South Carolina and ahigh-temperature, gas-cooled reactor at Idaho National EngineeringLaboratory in Idaho.   Also, Herrington said research and development should continueon the possibility of converting the commercial light water reactorat Hanford, known as Washington Nuclear Plant No. 1 or WNP-1.   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said in a reportdated Sept. 21 that ``while DOE's condemnation and completion of apartially completed commercial power plant as a defense productionplant do not violate the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty or existinglaw, it may raise policy questions.''   ``For example, such action may be criticized on the basis thatit breaks away from the traditional separation between peaceful useof atomic energy and military use,'' it said.   Although DOE has statutory authority to condemn the WNP-1 plant,the GAO said, the plant's cost through condemnation is not known.``The cost could range from $30 million (salvage value) to $2.1billion (total of the outstanding bonds).''   A DOE subcontractor has estimated that in addition to the costof acquiring the plant, the cost of completing WNP-1 for productionof tritium _ a hydrogen isotope used in nuclear weapons _ is $2.6billion.   In addition to the policy questions, the GAO pointed to otherissues including:   _ Possible need to modify WNP-1's decay heat removal system,used to remove heat from the core once the reactor is shut down,and the station's blackout prevention system, to provide auxiliarypower in case regular sources of electric power are unavailable.   _ Preventing ``recriticality,'' a fuel meltdown condition that``can result in an extremely severe accident.'' The GAO said thisrisk has been precluded by using 10 percent enriched uranium fuel,rather than the 20 percent enriched fuel initially planned.   _ Technical issues dealing with the design and manufacture oftritium ``target pins'' used within the reactor, as well as withthe reactor's capability of meeting tritium production goals.   _ Establishing safety requirements or standards that may beneeded for completing WNP-1 as a tritium production reactor ratherthan a commercial power facility.</TEXT></DOC>
