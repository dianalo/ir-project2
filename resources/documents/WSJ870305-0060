As a result, domestic car sales for February dropped 9.1%.    Meanwhile, General Motors Corp., whose sales have been the most disappointing of the Big Three auto makers, moved to prop up its lackluster results. The company sweetened its incentive programs yesterday just before releasing its latest sales figures. GM said it began offering low-interest financing on loans, ranging from 3.9% to 9.9%, as an alternative to the cash rebates and option-package rebates it is currently offering.    The weakness in the overall industry's February sales -- it was the second consecutive monthly decline compared with year-earlier figures -- has surprised some industry analysts and auto executives, because all the major auto companies already have various incentive programs in place to lure customers. It's a &quot;somewhat weaker market than we had expected,&quot; said Louis E. Lataif, Ford Motor Co.'s vice president for sales, although Ford itself posted healthy gains. Some of the major importers, such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp., also experienced sales declines in February.    Sales of U.S.-made cars rose to 198,818 in the Feb. 21-28 period from 186,353 a year earlier. Among the major auto makers, GM's sales fell 8% to 95,588; Ford's increased 29% to 51,411; and Chrysler Corp.'s rose 11% to 30,634.    Based on a U.S. Commerce Department formula, the late-February industry sales amounted to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.3 million cars, slightly better than the 7.1 million rate a year earlier. The adjusted annual rate in mid-February was 6.8 million; early in the month, it was 7.8 million.    The late-February increase in sales was expected by the industry in light of sweetened incentives earlier in the month and the fact that new buyers would begin entering the showrooms by now, ending the lull created by extensive rebates late last year. But the latest increase, which broke a string of sales declines since the beginning of the year, doesn't indicate any major rebound in sales, according to analysts. &quot;Demand for all of 1987 will be down significantly from last year,&quot; said Philip K. Fricke, an auto analyst with New York-based Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.    In all of February, domestic car sales declined 9.1% to 556,9535 from 612,632 a year earlier. GM's sales dropped 21%; Ford's increased 6.9%; and Chrysler's fell 2.3%.    The February U.S. sales amounted to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.3 million, compared with 8 million a year earlier and 5.9 million in January. Auto makers sold 8.2 million U.S.-made cars in 1986.    Importers sold 219,915 cars in February, an increase of less than 1% from 218,651 a year earlier. But Japanese auto companies' sales in the U.S. dropped 9.4% to 153,064. Toyota's sales declined 13%; Honda Motor Co.'s sales fell 15%; and Mazda's plummeted 48%. Nissan Motor Co., which has been offering dealer incentives on a number of its cars, was the only major Japanese auto maker to post a gain, a 36% increase.    The sales declines partly reflect the fact that the Japanese have had to raise prices sharply since the fall of 1985 to compensate for the appreciation of the yen relative to the dollar, analysts said. The Japanese may also have lost sales to new entries from South Korea -- which exported 18,656 cars in February, compared with 588 cars a year earlier -- and other Asian countries.    In the increasingly volatile market, the new incentives announced by GM indicate that the current programs aren't enough to stir up sales. An official at another major U.S. auto company suggested consumers are confused by the hodgepodge incentive programs the companies are offering. &quot;I don't know whether the dog food we have put out hasn't been served in a pretty plate, or whether the dog food itself isn't good enough,&quot; he added. &quot;It's probably a combination of both.&quot;    GM's latest incentives take the company further away from its vow in late 1986 to move away from companywide low-interest finance programs that hurt the company's third-quarter earnings last year. GM had said it would cut production to control inventories, but had to return to limited incentives earlier this year when sales fell below its expectations. The addition of low-rate financing, even though the rates aren't companywide, indicates that sales have fallen even further from expectations.    GM's new low-interest incentives cover a wide range of Oldsmobile, Buick and Pontiac vehicles. The programs will expire April 30, GM said.    ---              Percentage of Total U.S. Market                                              Feb.
