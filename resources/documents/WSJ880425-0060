ATandamp;T said it is offering voluntary transfers to employees in its Network Operations Group, which operates ATandamp;T's long-distance network, and Business Markets Group, which develops, markets and sells long-distance phone services and communications equipment to large companies. The transferred employees will act as support for national sales employees or become sales employees in the Business Markets Group, helping ATandamp;T generate more revenue from customers.    The move is similar, though on a much smaller scale, to that made by International Business Machines Corp., which has transferred tens of thousands of staff employees into revenue-producing jobs.    An ATandamp;T spokeswoman said employees who don't take the transfers may get reassigned; the object isn't to force resignations, she said. Analysts said the move is likely to be the first of many that ATandamp;T will make to reduce non-revenue producing staff jobs, and to cut overhead costs.    ATandamp;T also is gearing up for the day that regulation of its long-distance business may change to a system monitoring prices instead of profits, said Jack B. Grubman of PaineWebber Inc. Under price-cap regulation, ATandamp;T would be allowed to keep part of any profit generated by cutting costs. The FCC has proposed such a change, but it faces opposition from some industry and consumer groups.    But even if regulation doesn't change, analysts said the transfers will allow ATandamp;T to continue lowering long-distance prices, keeping competitors at bay.    ATandamp;T removed many sales-support positions in 1985 when it cut 24,000 jobs in Information Systems, an unprofitable unit that has since been folded into the long-distance phone service unit. But analysts said the latest move is meant primarily to boost sales of long-distance services. Because of federal regulation requiring ATandamp;T to separate its long-distance operations from its equipment unit, Information Systems only sold phone and computer equipment to businesses and consumers.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, ATandamp;T's stock closed at $27.125, up 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
