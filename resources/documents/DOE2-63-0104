<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-63-0104 </DOCNO><TEXT>An advanced large area silicon photodiode (and x-ray detector), calledSpiral Drift Detector, was designed, produced and tested. The SpiralDetector belongs to the family of silicon drift detectors and is an improvementof the well known Cylindrical Drift Detector. In both detectors, signalelectrons created in silicon by fast charged particles or photons aredrifting toward a practically point-like collection anode. The capacitanceof the anode is therefore kept at the minimum (0.1pF). The concentricrings of the cylindrical detector are replaced by a continuous spiralin the new detector. The spiral geometry detector design leads to a decreaseof the detector leakage current. In the spiral detector all electronsgenerated at the silicon-silicon oxide interface are collected on a guardsink rather than contributing to the detector leakage current. The decreaseof the leakage current reduces the parallel noise of the detector. Thisdecrease of the leakage current and the very small capacities of thedetector anode with a capacitively matched preamplifier may improve theenergy resolution of Spiral Drift Detectors operating at room temperaturedown to about 50 electrons rms. This resolution is in the range attainableat present only by cooled semiconductor detectors. 5 refs., 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
