 Will desktop systems allow publishers to perform allproduction tasks, including color-separations, in-house?andM;MacWEEK is actively working on answers to these questions.andP;  We'reexperimenting with hardware and software, we have highly skilled technicians,and our goal is to ship press-ready film to the printer.andM;This article is the first of a three-part series that traces the evolution ofa slide through the scanning process, image manipulation and finally itscolor separation.andP;  The series follows actual work by technical people inMacWEEK's production department, and we share with you insights gained andsome practical advice in using the technology.andM;While this article focuses on the Barneyscan and the Howtek Scanmaster 35, itlooks at what is common among slide scanners, what you need to know and whatthe general pitfalls are.andM;Slide scanners.andP;  There is a growing number of color scanners on the market tochoose from.andP;  they can be categorized by type, flatbed scanners andtransparency scanners; and by price, the very high-resolution scanners fromHell, Crosfield and Scitex that cost $200,000 and up and the more affordable35mm slide scanners that sell for about $10,000.andP;  This article looks at thelast group.andP;  For the day-to-day production of newspapers, magazines andcatalogs, most transparencies are in the 35mm formt.andP;  In fact, about 60percent of all photos in MacWEEK began as 35mm slides.andM;Currently there are three 35mm slide scanners for the Mac: the Barneyscanfrom Barneyscan Co., the Scanmaster 35 from Howtek, and the 35mm scanner fromTruvel, which was not available to us.andP;  Other companies that have announcedMac versions are Eikonics (Kodak) and Nikon.andM;What to look for on a slide.andP;  Looking closely at the slide is an importantfirst step.andP;  Your adjustments for exposure, sharpness and brightness dependon exactly what you see.andM;* Good single colors.andP;  Both scanners allow some kind of preview of teindividual colors in the computer's RGB (red, green, blue) format.andP;  Eachcolor should give good detailed information.andP;  Look for good contrast.andP;  Ifindividual colors look flat on the screen, chances are that the sum of thethree will look flat as well.andM;* Sharpness or contrast.andP;  Both scanners can scan sharp or normal.andP;  The sharpscan, which is adjustable in increments, allows the software to increasevalue differences on borders between two adjoining areas of different coloror brightness.andP;  Unfortunately, it also tends to pick up and emphasize noise,such as dust or irregularities in an even field like the sky.andP;  One way toavoid this is to scan in normal mode and sharpen only selected areas later.andM;* As mentioned, slides attract lint and dust.andP;  It is a good idea to wipe themwith antistatic prior to scanning.andP;  Failing to do so can result in intensiveretouch work later.andM;How scanners work.andP;  Scanning is not just a matter of slipping a slide into abox and waiting for the image to appear on the screen.andP;  The first step is tocalibrate the scanner, which means adjusting it for optimum performance.andM;The calibration procedure is different from scanner to scanner but serves thesame end: to adjust the driver software to the state of the hardware, whichcan change with, for example, the temperature of the bulb or the state of thetransport mechanism.andM;Howtek scanner users need to calibrate the machine each time the scanner isturned on; it takes about two minutes.andP;  Barneyscan recommends calibrating itsscanner once a week, although if the scanner is moved, a calibration isalways recommended.andP;  Full calibration on the Barneyscan might take 200minutes or more, although the recommended partial calibration takes onlythree minutes.andM;Calibrations for either scanner are done with calibration slides suppliedwith the scanners, an opaque black and an empty frame for the Howtek and afive-gray stripped for the Barneyscan.andM;Once a slide is inserted in a scanner carriage, it slowly passes in front ofa charge-coupled device (CCD) array.andP;  The array is made up of either 1,024elements (Barneyscan) or the higher resolution of 2,048 elements (Howtek)that act as independent light detectors.andP;  A number of optical lenses setbetween the slide and the array ensure optimal focus.andP;  In addition, there isthe all-important color filter wheel that contains four filters, one forblack and white and the other three for red, green and blue.andP;  the slide willpass either once in the front of the CCD array for the black-and-white imageor three times for separate red, green and blue readings.andM;As a color image is moved in the front of a single element of CCD, theelement captures and transmits the level of light emitted by its pixels.andP;  Togain a 24-bit image required for high-quality output, the same pixel passesthree times in the front of the CCD and a different color filter gel (red,green and blue) to extract a total number of 24 bits (three times eight) toform one pixel.andM;The scan takes one to two minutes for black-and-white images and up to fiveminutes for color ones.andP;  Once scanning is finished, the images can be savedin different file formats, such as TIFF, in either eight-bit or in 24-bitformat, or in PICT2.andM;Performance.andP;  Several factors affect the performance of the scanner.andO;Resolution depends to some extent on the number of CCD elements, as moreelements aimed at the same amount of surface tend to pick up more details.andO;Barneyscan has 1,024 and Howtek 2,048 element CCD arrays.andP;  New scannerscoming to the market will have an even higher number of elements.andP;  The Nikonscanner will employ a 4,096-element array, while an upcoming scanner fromKodak will have an array of more than 6,000 elements.andP;  On the down side, asthe number of the elements increases, so does the file size of the output.andM;Lith source.andP;  Another difference in performance could be the tpe of lightsource used to illuminate the slide.andP;  Fluorescent light, used by the Howtek,is colder and therefore the emitted spectrum changes less with the increasein temperature.andP;  However, it is harder to color correct its bluish hues.andM;The Barneyscan employs a quartz halogen bulb, a warmer light, that is pipedvia fiber optics from the rear to te front.andM;A problem that still needs to be corrected is the even transport of the slidein front of the CCD array.andP;  Also, the scanner needs to focus clearly on teslide to pick up as much data possible.andP;  The Barneyscan has an adjustmentknob for focus; the Howtek has a fixed focus.andM;Driver software.andP;  Finally, don't underestimate the importance of the driversoftware.andP;  The software ot only allows the scanning but provides ways tocorrect for deficiencies in the slide.andP;  Exposure control can help to correctfor brightness and details.andP;  The gamma correction will effect your finalimage as well.andP;  Although both Barneyscan and Howtek software allow additionalcolor editing after scanning, the Barneyscan's XP-module offers a much morecomprehensive set of editing tools to alter the image prior to saving.andM;What can go wrong?andP;  The brightness value can give you trouble.andP;  An image canend up looking either too dark or light, but this can be adjusted with thebrightness setting or the gamma setting.andP;  While the brightness value adjustsoverall color by uniform percentages, the gamma correction works on a curveso that different parts of a picture are affected by their position on thecurve.andM;It helps to play with these features to find out how the affect a particularslide.andP;  Although the default for the gamma setting is usually for 100 percent(or 1.0), you cannot necessarily hold it through separation and print becausethe slide's dynamic range from light to dark is much greater than the printedmedium's.andP;  However, in slides with great differences between light and darkin which you want to hold details in te light areas, you may be tempted toincrease the gamma setting.andP;  After the scan is finished, the gamma is resetand the picture is brightened, in an image-manipulation program like theBarneyscan XP, Photomac or LaserPaint's paint module.andP;  What might happen isthat as the dynamic range is stretched, certain colors might break down.andO;When you add to the gamma curve, you increase the distance between any twopoints representing colors.andP;  At some point the curve will become larger thanavailable information and the color will break, causing visible lines on theimage.andM;Output size.andP;  The important thing to remember is that you need a lot ofstorage for all your scanned slides.andP;  Furthermore, you should keep the finalprint size in mind.andP;  If the intended print size is 2 inches by 2 inchesprinted at 133 lines (average magazine print), you might need to save only aresolution of 500-by-500 pixels, which would create a mere 850-Kbyte file,just a bit too large to fit on a 3.5-inch disk.andP;  The conventional thinking isthat you need at least two pixels for each line printed, or sin a 2-inch-wideprint the number would be 2 (inches) multiplied by 133 (lines) multiplied by2 (pixels).andP;  This equals 532 pixels for one slide.andP;  To get the total filesize, width is multiplied by depth and then multiplied by three for the threecolors (RGB).andP;  In our example, the arithmetic would go like this: 532 (width)multiplied by 532 (depth) multiplied by three equals 849,072 bytes or 850Kbytes.andM;To scan or not to scan.andP;  Definitely scan.andP;  It is a sensible way to get acolor image input with a manageable file size.andP;  It never ceases to amaze ushow much detail the scanners picks up from a 35mm slide.andP;  Viewing the scannedimages on a 24-bit RasterOps screen shows the true resolution power of theseprecision scanners.andP;  although slide-scanning has not yet reached perfectionand is not meant for the casual user, experimentation by someone who has beentrained can begin to yield some noteworthy results.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
