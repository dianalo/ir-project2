Gold prices resumed their recent decline in New York, falling totheir lowest level since April 1987 in moderate volume. RepublicNational Bank of New York quoted a late bid price for gold of$429.50 a troy ounce, down from $433 late Thursday.   The dollar slipped in Asia and Europe, reflecting lingeringdisappointment over Thursday's report that the U.S. economyexpanded at a 4.5 percent pace in the fourth quarter when sometraders had expected a 5 percent rise.   But dealers in Europe said expectations that central banks mightintervene to support the dollar prevented it from falling evenlower.   John Hazelton, a vice president for institutional sales atManufacturers Hanover Trust Co., said the dollar traded in a verynarrow range in the United States with professional tradersaccounting for the bulk of the activity.   ``They are about the only ones involved in the market,'' hesaid. ``There has been very little corporate or institutionalbusiness. It's mostly traders in the various banks.''   He said the market shrugged off the latest government reports onthe U.S. economy, which said Friday that personal income, consumerprices and consumer spending each rose 0.3 percent in January. Theincreases were within expectations.   ``We are in a quiet period for the currencies,'' Hazelton said.   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 128.35 Japanese yen from 128.80 yenon Thursday.
