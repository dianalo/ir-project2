Seven and a half centuries later, Hungariantrade officials joke that they'll forgive all when and if theTatars come across with some much-needed oil.   Hungarian officials say their ability to weather economiccrisis in 1991 depends greatly upon negotiations with theTatars, the Bashkirs and the Komis, ethnic groups from theSoviet Union's Russian republic who are laying claim to vastraw material reserves in their regions. Unable to get Moscowtrade officials to barter Soviet raw materials, especiallyoil, for Hungarian food and medical supplies, Budapest isturning to local and regional authorities in the SovietUnion.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There are small kingdoms throughout the Soviet Union withsome powers and control over raw materials,&quot; says Peter Bod,Hungary's minister of industry. &quot;We talk to them now becausepreviously we talked to the center and the center didn't keepits word.&quot;   Soviet disorder, rising oil prices and a Moscow-imposeddollar-based trading system that began Jan. 1 for EasternEurope ensure that 1991 will be a hard year for the region.Eastern Europe has been getting most of its oil, atsubsidized prices, from the Soviet Union. But oil analystssay Moscow's urgent need for hard cash means the EastEuropeans will have to shell out nearly $20 billion more fortheir oil in the coming year -- unless they can arrangebarter deals. The added burden could force some of them intodefaults in servicing their hard-currency debt.   National income in Eastern Europe fell an estimated 11%last year, while inflation is expected to rise to 28% thisyear, according to a study by David C. Roche, head of theequity research department of Morgan Stanley in London. Hepredicts unemployment in the region will reach 21% by 1994. Arapid growth of the private economy, particularly in Hungaryand Poland, isn't nearly great enough to compensate for steepdeclines in the far larger state-owned sector.   Without significant Western financing, aid and debtrelief, East Europe will fall into a sustained downturn, hepredicts. Yet Mr. Roche optimistically calls the next two tothree years &quot;the darkest hours before dawn.&quot; Because of alack of alternatives, he figures that the countries willplunge ahead with economic reforms and eventually succeed.   Many investors agree. &quot;You'll see a double or tripling inper-capita income by the year 2000,&quot; says Mark Palmer, theformer U.S. ambassador to Hungary who is now the chiefexecutive officer at the Central European Development Corp.,a private company backed by U.S. investors, with banking,real estate and investment interests in Eastern Europe. &quot;Butfor now it's going to go steeply and scarily downhill. Yetthis is the time to get in. The worse things get, the betterprices are. The underlying real estate assets alone are oftenworth more than investments.&quot;   Morgan Stanley sees investment opportunities even duringthe most difficult months ahead, although it fears EastEuropeans are growing more reluctant and nationalistic aboutselling off their country's assets at rock-bottom prices.Still, says Mr. Roche, &quot;There is no shortage of sectors toinvest in. . . . Nuclear stations will be refurbished,newspapers will multiply, publicity and advertising will beborn, telecommunications networks will be installed,infrastructure will be developed, travel and tourism willgrow, agriculture will be reformed, money will be lent andinvested, privatization will boom.&quot;   There are also plenty of landmines, besides Sovietcollapse, along the road to the free market. Germany'spreoccupation with the huge costs of unification will keepEast European economies waiting in line for help from theregion's wealthiest source of financing and aid. In addition,impatient citizens with high expectations aren't ready toaccept austerity and growing joblessness; unstablegovernments are liberalizing more slowly than investors hadhoped, and an outflow of economic refugees might promptemergency Western aid programs, such as are under way in theSoviet Union, that buy governments time but don't help curethe disease.   ---   Conversations with bankers, economists and officials inthe region provide the following guide for investors. Thelist is roughly in the order of preference by Westerninvestors.                                                                                                          Eastern Germany                                                                                                          The five new federal states of what was East Germanyprovide good opportunities for non-German investors to getinto the European Community before 1992's more-unifiedmarket.   The drawback is that workers are demanding wages more inline with their western neighbors. And German companies aredoing their best to monopolize the market. Yet easternGermans, resentful about a unification that looks more like atakeover, are increasingly open to outside partners as ameans of protection.   Still, foreign investment has fallen far short ofgovernment hopes, forcing Bonn to pour in subsidies thatcould reach 50 billion marks ($32.6 billion) a year. ManyGerman companies that considered investing in the east haveinstead decided to view the region only as a sales market.                                                                                                          Hungary                                                                                                          Hungary is the easiest place in the region for Westernbusinessmen to work, and many have set up their East Europeanheadquarters there. But Hungary has the region's highestper-capita debt load, and the expected shocks of 1991threaten its superb repayment record.   Investors' early euphoria about Hungary has faded somebecause of the weak government's slow privatization of theeconomy, particularly of the largest companies, and thedifficulty of negotiating deals through state privatizationagencies. The Hungarian Investment Fund, based in London, hasinvested only 30% of the $100 million it raised lastFebruary. &quot;Too many people have gone into markets likeHungary believing that things would happen overnight,&quot; saysSteve Wood, who manages the fund for John Govett andamp; Co. Hesays his fund is slowly finding investment opportunities andshould be half invested within months.   But Hungary's real draw is its telecommunications andbanking and financial services infrastructure that, while farbehind world standards, far exceeds that of its neighbors.Hungary began economic reforms in 1968, and its people aremore accustomed to the needs of the free market. Its middleclass is the most developed, and foreign investment is thehighest in the region, not including eastern Germany.   Yet the debt load of 20 billion marks for a country ofonly three million people worries Western bankers. Centralbank President Gyorgy Suranyi argues that a bettermeasurement of the country's health is the extent to whichHungary has improved its foreign-exchange income through a60% growth of exports to the West last year and a 70%increase in tourism receipts. Hungary has already reduced theSoviet portion of its total trade to 27% from 40%, making itless vulnerable in 1991.   But Western economists say the switch to dollar-basedtrade with the Soviets will destroy these gains unlessHungary can quickly develop new export markets. Mr. Suranyisays the Hungarian economy will lose $2 billion this yearbecause of the aftereffects of a drought, increased oilprices and the loss of Soviet markets.                                                                                                          Poland                                                                                                          Poland's &quot;shock therapy&quot; of market prices and withdrawnsubsidies is part of the most consistent policy of economicreform in the region. But investors are wary of politicalinstability, a high debt burden and an outmoded social andeconomic structure. As a result, foreign investment has beenless than authorities had hoped. Yet a pronounced anti-Germanattitude among Poles provides American and non-GermanEuropean investors an advantage they lack elsewhere incompeting with the region's most aggressive investors.   But a German banker says the problem is the lack of Polishmanagerial skills and the strength of the &quot;counter-modern&quot;labor unions and the Roman Catholic Church.   &quot;What worries me most in Poland is the strength of thehostility toward people who make money,&quot; says GeorgeSchoepflin of the London School of Economics. &quot;From the pointof view of the man on the shop floor, it's bloodyintolerable. The problem with Poland is a society that isbackward, increasingly impatient and intolerant.&quot;   Even so, Poland has proven adept at finding Westernmarkets and cutting hard-currency imports. Hard-currencyexports grew 25% in last year's first nine months, whilehard-currency imports shrank by a like degree. Also, Poland'scoal production makes it less vulnerable to rising Soviet oilprices. Its strong farm sector could rapidly increase exportearnings.                                                                                                          Czechoslovakia                                                                                                          Many German businessmen are bullish on Czechoslovakia.They cite the country's small debt load, its history as oneof Europe's most modern economies before World War II, andits educated work force. Ethnically, they consider the Czechsto be the most like themselves, and thus prefer this marketto Poland's.   But there is plenty of reason to be cautious aboutCzechoslovakia. It has carried out nearly 70% of its foreigntrade with the Soviet Union and East Germany, and so will behit hardest by the coming crisis. It also will have moreproblems finding new markets for its goods than eitherHungary or Poland, because its major exports are machineryand capital goods that are 15 years out of date.   More problematic over the long term is a lag in attitudes.The country was the least reform-minded in East Europe.Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus may be one of the region's mostfar-sighted economic architects, but he faces an uphillbattle against other Czech leaders and a public that haslived relatively well under socialism. Czechs are lesswilling than Poles or Hungarians to make sacrifices for thefree market. &quot;The fact that the people have rejected thereligion of Communism doesn't yet mean that they haveaccepted a new approach,&quot; Mr. Klaus has said.                                                                                                          Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia                                                                                                          Historians traditionally have viewed this region, roughlyknown as the Balkans, as backward and divided. Investors fearthe region is returning to its roots and they are stayingaway in droves.   While other countries in the region look for economicsolutions, these countries are still seeking scapegoats. Theyhave yet to fully overthrow their former Communistleaderships. &quot;The political revolution is over in the north,but the political revolution in the south is still underway,&quot; says Mr. Palmer of the Central European DevelopmentCorporation.   The increase in Bulgaria's oil bill from the Soviets in1991 will require financing equivalent to 120% to 180% of itsforeign-exchange earnings. Bulgaria stopped repaying itsloans last year. However, its foreign-investment legislationis far more liberal than that of Romania, and outsiders witha knack for cracking bureaucracy are forming joint venturesthat could give them ready-made access to the Soviet marketand a chance to exploit Bulgaria's untapped farm potential.Yet foreigners remain wary because Bulgaria is still led bythe successor party to its Communist leaders and inflationfears are growing.   Just yesterday Romania said that beginning in 15 days itwould allow certain companies and banks to freely trade insome hard currencies, initially dollars and German marks. Thegovernment also decided to lift most trade restrictions andallow free import and export, said the state news agencyRompres. It would retain the right, however, to impose hightariffs on imports that could hurt local production. Thosechanges notwithstanding, Romania's economy and society wereso misshapen by former President Nicolai Ceaucescu that itwill take years to repair, though the agricultural sectorprovides some opportunities.   Investors once viewed Yugoslavia as the best bet in theregion, particularly focusing on opportunities in therepublic of Slovenia in the north. But the recent rise topower of a hard-line Communist, Slobodan Milosevic, in hisrepublic of Serbia has increased the likelihood thatYugoslavia will remain backward and increasingly divided.   ---   Still, the wild cards in Eastern Europe's fortunes are theextent to which it will suffer from the loss of Sovietmarkets and the rise in oil prices, and the nature and sizeof Western assistance.   Some countries, like Hungary and Poland, will try tooffset what's lost to the Soviets by expanding export marketsand tourism revenues. Others, such as Czechoslovakia andBulgaria, are likely to increase exports by expanding bartertrade. All are exploring individual deals for raw materialswith Soviet republics and small regions -- a risky course,says Mr. Roche of Morgan Stanley.   &quot;Once martial law is declared, the first thing {Moscow}will do is stop this kind of nonsense,&quot; he says. &quot;Any EasternEuropean country depending on these sorts of deliveries isliving in cloud cuckoo land.&quot;   The Soviet Union once gave Eastern Europeans a break onoil prices as part of the cost of empire; now it will drivethe hardest bargain possible to save its own skin. What'sincreasingly apparent is that, without indigenous means toabsorb the blow, the East Europeans will increasingly come tothe West with hats in hand.   &quot;The cold war is over, but this will be a very dangerouspeace,&quot; says Laszlo Keri, a Hungarian political scientist.   &quot;Without Western help there will be civil wars in EasternEurope. Conflicts are growing between nationalities, betweenrich people and poor, between the government and streetprotesters, between industrialists and laborers . . .&quot;   He likens Eastern Europe's situation to that of WesternEurope after World War II. &quot;The war has only just ended here,so we are in the same position of Germany or Japan in 1945.The only problem is that the world isn't in the samecondition to help us. Who is ready to play the role now thatthe United States did then?&quot;   ---            Eastern Europe: An Economic Gamble                                                                                                          The former communist governments must now face therealities of market economies.
