<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-20-1013 </DOCNO><TEXT>The upgrading of LEP by s.c. cavities will require installation and operationof a few hundred 350 MHz, 4-cell cavities in the accelerator tunnel.It is at present anticipated to install eight cavities per rf-cell whichhave a length of {similar_to} 24 m. A tunnel slope of up to 1.5% anda tunnel diameter of 4.4 m have to be accommodated. For the design ofadequate cryostats the following guiding lines were considered: up toeight cavities with their He tank could be housed in a common insulationvacuum. Cryostats should be modular and allow installation of individualcavities or groups of two cavities (with a total length not exceeding6 m thus enabling normal transport inside the access pits and machinetunnel). A high accessibility to all critical parts like couplers, tunersand beam tube connections should be guaranteed. This requirement dictatesa lateral access through the vacuum tank and thermal radiation shieldwhich should also permit the removal and replacement of any one 4-cellcavity without disturbing the neighboring units. Cavity connections tothe beam vacuum system as well as repairs should be possible under reasonablyclean and dust-free conditions, particularly when keeping cavities undera slight overpressure of dry, dust-free protective gas. A test programwas launched and a 1/5 scale model vacuum tank was constructed and tested.The main feature of this model was a frame and sealing skin design whichoffers complete accessibility to the inside of the vessel. The resultsobtained prompted the design and construction of a full size model whichwas completed in 1985 and proved the feasibility of the new concepts.A thin copper radiation shield mechanically clamped to the piping carryingthe refrigerant and thus easily removable to meet the requirement ofaccessibility also proved adequate to intercept and evacuate the heatradiated by the vacuum tank. 4 references, 6 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
