Charles Wilson calls it &quot;the Ukrainian connection.&quot;    The congressman's girlfriend is a former Miss World-USA (1975) of Ukrainian descent. The wife of his longtime friend, millionaire executive John W. Rollins, is also a former Miss World-USA (1963) of Ukrainian descent. So when Mr. Rollins needed a big favor, who better to turn to than the flamboyant Texas Democrat?    The favor in this case is to pressure the government of Jamaica to settle a longstanding dispute with Mr. Rollins over 3,000 acres of prime island property. Mr. Wilson's solution: a shut-off of all U.S. foreign aid to financially stricken Jamaica, a close ally of the U.S.    U.S. foreign aid to the Caribbean nation is supposed to reach $42 million this fiscal year. Already, Rep. Wilson has held up a scheduled payment of $100,000 and says he is prepared to block more. &quot;As long as there is no explanation for apparent illegal confiscation of the property of an American taxpayer,&quot; Rep. Wilson pledges, &quot;I intend to be a problem.&quot;    But the congressman's actions have both the American and the Jamaican governments hopping mad. &quot;It's ludicrous for American policy in Jamaica to be manipulated to serve the selfish interests of a single person,&quot; says an angry State Department aide. And a Jamaican official warns: &quot;Jamaica does not intend to be held to ransom by any individual.&quot;    The dispute dates to the mid-1970s, when Mr. Rollins, the founder and major shareholder of RLC Corp., a trucking and leasing company, and of Rollins Environmental Services Inc., fell behind in payments on a mortgage to a unit of Chase Manhattan Bank. The bank took possession of a large chunk of his huge holdings there: a Holiday Inn and some 3,000 acres of land. In 1976, the bank unit sold the property to the Jamaican government.    Attorneys for Mr. Rollins say that the land was taken illegally. They want the government to return some of it and sell other parts back to Mr. Rollins. Jamaica insists that its purchase was valid and that it is negotiating in good faith with Mr. Rollins on all of his claims, including his interest in land around a tourist attraction called the Rose Hall Great House. But after suits by Mr. Rollins in both U.S. and Jamaican courts failed to give him satisfaction, he looked to his friends in Washington for help.    One friend was Mr. Wilson, both he and a spokesman for Mr. Rollins say. Except for the Ukrainian connection, the two men are quite different. Mr. Rollins, 71 years old, is a big contributor to the Republican Party and a former lieutenant governor of Delaware. Mr. Wilson, 54, is a Democrat and former lumberyard manager who has represented a poor, rural region of east Texas since 1973.    Mr. Wilson sits on the powerful appropriations panel, and that tends to widen his circle of friends. He was introduced to Mr. Rollins in his office several years ago by John Camp, a lobbyist with many international clients. &quot;They had an interest in the same area of the world,&quot; Mr. Camp recalls. &quot;A staunch Republican and a staunch Democrat, but that's what makes this city work.&quot;    Their association strengthened when Mr. Wilson began to date Annelise Ilschenko, the former beauty queen. Two Thanksgivings ago, Rep. Wilson says, he and Ms. Ilschenko were house guests of the Rollinses in Jamaica. (He says he paid for their air fare and the car rental.) He estimates that he has seen each of the Rollinses once or twice in each of the past two years.    &quot;I really like Rollins, he's a very interesting man,&quot; Rep. Wilson says. &quot;My interest in this case is the guy personally and Michele&quot; -- the former Michele Metrinko, Mr. Rollins's beauty-queen wife. In fact, it was Mrs. Rollins, a Georgetown Law School graduate and the president of Mr. Rollins's privately owned Rollins Jamaica Ltd., who did a lot of the persuading on the Jamaican issue. She and another attorney spent two hours briefing Rep. Wilson about the dispute. &quot;You don't spend two hours listening to someone who just comes in off the street,&quot; Mr. Wilson says.    The Rollinses apparently pleaded their case well. In the omnibus spending bill passed in the dead of night late last December, Congress included a provision requiring the Reagan administration to notify the congressional appropriations committees before sending aid to Jamaica; the committees could then block the aid at the request of any member.    When a request came to send $100,000 for a Jamaican housing project earlier this year, Mr. Wilson, a member of the subcommittee that controls foreign aid, simply said no, and the committee suspended the aid.    Mr. Wilson says he took the action on the merits of the Rollins case and sees nothing wrong with his actions. &quot;Jamaica has been pretty high-handed about confiscating American citizens' property down there,&quot; he charges. &quot;Denying appropriations is the only real power the Congress has got&quot; to make its protest known.    The Jamaica flap isn't the only example of Mr. Wilson's personal experiences influencing federal policy. In revenge for the refusal of a U.S. official in Pakistan to allow Ms. Ilschenko to board a government plane when she accompanied him on a trip, Mr. Wilson last year engineered a reduction in the number of government airplanes available to U.S. embassies.    Mr. Wilson isn't the only lawmaker who supports Mr. Rollins, and the Rollins interests are optimistic that a settlement can be reached. &quot;We were looking for help, and the remedy was devised by the Congress,&quot; says Don Stansberry, an attorney for Mr. Rollins.    The Jamaican government, however, &quot;has notified Rollins that it has no intention of conducting discussions with a pistol to its head,&quot; a Jamaican official says.    While the controversy drags on, Mr. Rollins still maintains ownership of Rose Hall, the great manor house that is a centerpiece of the dispute. The Rollinses have even produced a book about the building, lavishly illustrated with color photographs. The house is reputed to be cursed: According to the book, legend has it that it was previously owned by a sorceress who murdered her husbands. </TEXT></DOC>
