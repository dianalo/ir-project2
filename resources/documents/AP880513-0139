Senate Majority leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said debatecould begin early next week, after a trio of Senate committeesexamine the agreements and formally approve them.   ``They are the experts in their fields,'' Byrd said.   Commenting after a 90-minute luncheon briefing by NationalSecurity Adviser Colin Powell, Byrd said Senate leaders were toldthe agreement was significant and ``enhances the national securityof this country.''   ``The briefing was positive and good,'' Byrd said.   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said it is clearByrd's decision last week to postpone action on the treaty whilenegotiators addressed concerns that the Soviets were backing awayfrom effective implementation of inspection provisions ``played avery constructive role.''   ``It did make a difference,'' Dole said.   Several other senators who attended the briefing also said theresults of the Geneva talks between Secretary of State George P.Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze do seempositive and constructive.   ``Im optimistic we can move ahead,'' said Sen. Claiborne Pell,D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   ``I think at this moment there is more optimism for the passageof this treaty than at at any other time during this longprocess,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the ranking GOP member ofthe Senate Armed Services Committee.   Warner said that it appears the Soviets agreed to change theirposition on all issues raised by the U.S. side.   ``I'm confident my colleagues on Monday will come to a similarconclusion,'' Warner said.   Some senators said there is now at least a possibility that theSenate will consent to the ratification of the treaty by the timePresident Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev convenetheir Moscow summit on May 29.   Since most vote counts show overwhelming Senate support for thepact, the leading question is whether Reagan will have a ratifiedtreaty in hand as incentive for the two superpowers to make furtherprogress on arms reduction.   Byrd said the treaty is too important to national security foreither him or the Senate to be ``driven by artificial, automatic,arbitrary calendar deadlines.''   Byrd said he will try to push the treaty through the Senate asquickly as possible once debate opens but will not guarantee thatcan be done before the summit.   He said he will not permit debate to begin until the on-siteinspection plan worked out in Geneva is examined and approved bythe Foreign Relations, Armed Services and Intelligence committees.   ``We were told all the I's were dotted and all the T's werecrossed,'' Byrd said of the Reagan administration's position on thetreaty before the latest furor.   ``It was through the examination of these committees that it wasfound that this was not the case,'' he said.   ``If we make a mistake in this treaty and we find we have beenhoodwinked or outsmarted, then you can kiss the next arms treatygoodbye,'' Byrd said. ``Let's do this thing right.''   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign RelationsCommittee, said Shultz will testify before that panel Mondayafternoon with the Senate's bipartisan leadership and the chairmenand ranking GOP members of the two other committees invited toparticipate.   Pell said that if no further snags are uncovered, Senate debatecould open Tuesday.   Earlier this week, Byrd postponed action on the new treaty untilShultz and Shevardnadze resolved a serious dispute over theimplementation of anti-cheating provisions.   The dispute centered on what U.S. inspectors will be permittedto see and do as they try to learn whether the Soviets live up tothe requirements of the treaty to eliminate all their medium-rangemissiles.</TEXT></DOC>
