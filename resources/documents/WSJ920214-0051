This prompted fears that Beijing plans to use the group togain a foothold in the British colony before it is handedover to Chinese rule in 1997.   The advisory committee, officially to aid in thetransition but known derisively in Hong Kong as the &quot;Gang of40,&quot; is composed mainly of business tycoons, conservativepoliticians and China sympathizers. Liberal legislatorstermed the appointments another attempt by Beijing to stripthe territory of autonomy.   Beijing recently has been increasingly vocal about itsdispleasure with political developments in Hong Kong. Doubtlingers in the colony that China will honor its pledge in a1984 Sino-British agreement to guarantee Hong Kong and itscapitalistic system a &quot;high degree of autonomy&quot; for 50 yearsafter 1997.                                                                                                          JAPAN'S PHASE-OUT OF CFCS                                                                                                          Japan plans to accelerate its phase-out ofozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons, following a U.S.decision to ban the chemicals by 1995. But Tokyo expresseddoubt about satisfying Western industrial nations' pleas tospeed up discontinuance of all CFCs, as they include acleaning agent for metals widely used by smaller industriesin Japan. Tokyo will present its phase-out plans at aNovember meeting of signatories of the 1987 MontrealProtocol, under which CFC production and use will be bannedby the year 2005. CFCs are used mainly as coolants, aerosolpropellants and semiconductor cleaning agents.                                                                                                          HUNGARY GAINS CONTROL OF PAPER                                                                                                          Hungary gained control of the newspaper Esti Hirlap bybuying the 40% stake of the late British publisher RobertMaxwell. The deal boosted to 80% Budapest's holding in theunprofitable 60,000-circulation daily. The price wasn'tdisclosed. The paper's employees own the remaining 20%. PrimeMinister Jozsef Antall's center-right government has soughtmore influence in the media. Mr. Antall has blamed negativemedia coverage for the government's poor showing in opinionpolls since his party ousted the Communists in 1990elections.                                                                                                          PHILIPPINES A SMUGGLING HAVEN                                                                                                          More than $1 billion of goods are smuggled into thePhilippines every year, the World Bank said, pressing Manilato take stronger actions to stop the contraband flow, whichappears to be on the rise. Controlling smuggling is difficultin the archipelago, but &quot;it appears the government doesn'teven try,&quot; the bank said in a confidential report obtained byReuters news agency. The bank said customs is inadequate andhas an insufficient budget. Most goods smuggled werehigh-tariff items, such as textiles, electronics, food andmotor parts. Ships take out illegally cut timber andprivately mined gold and minerals.                                                                                                          JAPAN'S BANK-LENDING PACE SLOWS                                                                                                          Lending by Japanese banks in January grew at the slowestpace ever for the third month in a row. The growth rate of4.2% to 512.77 trillion yen ($4.025 trillion) of loansoutstanding from a year earlier was the smallest since theBank of Japan began keeping these records in 1965. Banklending grew 4.3% in December and 4.6% in November. Thecentral bank attributed the anemic performance to Japan'sslowdown in economic growth, expectations of a further dropin interest rates and firms' issuance of debt securities.                                                                                                          SPAIN EHANCES POLICE POWERS                                                                                                          Spain's Parliament cleared a security bill giving policeextra powers. The opposition conservatives planned tochallenge the constitutionality of the bill, sponsored byPrime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist government. Theconservatives object to provisions that allow police to enterprivate homes where occupants are suspected of drugtrafficking, and to detain people who can't produceidentification. The opposition contends this could allowpolice action on scant evidence.                                                                                                          PORTUGAL WARNED ON INFLATION                                                                                                          Portugal must rein in inflation if it hopes to become anequal partner in the European Community monetary and economicunion, the Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment said.   The OECD, a group of rich industrial nations, laudedPortugal's output and employment as an EC member and itsstrong balance of payments.   But inflation fueled by surging consumer demand isbreaking Portugal's economic growth trend of the past fewyears and choking off export gains. The country's inflationrate was 13% in 1990 and an estimated 12% last year.   Growth in gross domestic product slowed to about 2.75% in1991 from an average of 4.5% in the preceding five years.Government spending has surged and the deficit widened.
