Gigot</HL><DATE>05/04/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10</SO><CO>   FREST</CO><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE)</GV><LP>   The voice of conscience was soft but firm. &quot;Even theworld's darling does not have the monopolistic right todecide the fate of other nations,&quot; said the Lithuanian primeminister, reading from her handwritten notes. The congressmengrinned at that crack about Mikhail Gorbachev.   There she went again, Kazimiera Prunskiene, making herselfa most inconvenient person. Here she is, with that widesmile, saying things few really want to hear. A cityconvinced of Mr. Gorbachev's unerring judgment is getting asecond opinion. An administration hoping for a cosy summitMay 30 suddenly must confront 40 years of Republican &quot;CaptiveNations&quot; rhetoric. Wouldn't you know, this 47-year-old formereconomist shows up as the needy but unwanted relative, atwinge of conscience amid cold-blooded calculations ofnational interest.</LP><TEXT>   A back-seat conversation driving through town revealssomething more: She feels she's a cold-blooded realist too.&quot;I want to emphasize the mistake Western countries make whenthey talk about the threat to Gorbachev,&quot; she says, her voicetensing as if this is her main point. &quot;They don't recognizethat the pressure being imposed on Gorbachev is coming fromtwo different directions.&quot;   The forces of old reaction are contending with newer&quot;democratic forces&quot; that want radical reform and are growingin strength. Mr. Gorbachev has walked a delicate line betweenthem, she says, but sooner or later he must choose. Bysqueezing Lithuania, Mr. Gorbachev sides with thereactionaries. But the democrats all across the Soviet&quot;empire&quot; support Lithuanian self-determination. &quot;Thedemocratic forces understand that the question of whether wehave a democratic Soviet Union, a democratic Russia, is beingdecided today in Lithuania,&quot; she says.   What about George Bush's fear of a military coup? Pressurefrom the West regarding Lithuania actually helps, rather thanhinders, Mr. Gorbachev's reform efforts, the prime ministerexplains. If he sides with the democrats, he will becomestronger and have more allies to fight off the reaction.Besides, she adds, he's firmly in control of both themilitary and KGB.   Lithuanians are willing to compromise, but only Westernpressure will ensure that Mr. Gorbachev also bargains in goodfaith. She isn't asking for much nor talking about &quot;Munich.&quot;'What she wants are &quot;international guarantees&quot; to mediate thedispute and perhaps some help to &quot;neutralize&quot; the Sovietembargo.   Her principal target, George Bush, at least avoided GeraldFord's Solzenitsyn mistake. President Ford's refusal toentertain the storied Russian dissident became a metaphor forthe obsequious detente of the 1970s.   Not that Mr. Bush or his aides had sought Mrs.Prunskiene's company. They'd hoped she'd have the good tasteto wait until after the Bush-Gorbachev summit (and weeklongphoto-op). Lithuanian sources say her first response from theState Department in Moscow was to wait until June. Only afterthat story leaked did State find a visa, they say.   And only after criticism from senators did the White Housejoin the publicity queue. Joseph Kazickas, aLithuanian-American who arranged her visit here, got hisfirst White House call Monday afternoon. Hand-wringingNational Security Council staffers had known she was comingfor days. (Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater says the White Housereceived its first formal request Monday and assented thenext day.) As a mere &quot;private&quot; visitor, Mrs. Prunskiene wasalso denied any U.S. security or transport. Her entourage hadto weave its own way through traffic in five $45-an-hourrented sedans.   Mr. Bush did give Mrs. Prunskiene 45 minutes, evenaddressed her as &quot;prime minister.&quot; Mr. Bush may refuse herrequest for formal recognition, but he is unfailinglycordial. If small captive nations were people, Mr. Bush wouldinvite each one for dinner and a movie, and hope there'd beno hard feelings.   Congress embraced Mrs. Prunskiene more eagerly, thoughhardly with the acclaim accorded Lech Walesa or Vaclav Havel.Perhaps it's part of Congress's psyche to prefer winners tolong shots. Still, she had breakfast and lunch on the Hill,and spoke before the body's Helsinki human rights commission,framed by the American and the gold, green and red Lithuanianflags.   The only sour note came from Ed Markey, the Massachusettsliberal, who lectured her for having the gall to endanger theestimable Mr. Gorbachev. His performance had even senatorsrolling their eyes and Lithuanians in the audience applaudingwhen Sen. James McClure, the Idaho Republican, begged todiffer. Mr. Markey is the sort who's a moralist about allcauses but the freedom of Balts or Russians; about that he'sa realist manque.   The Markey malarkey at least had the virtue of candorabout Washington's probable intentions. No one wants to dovery much to help Mrs. Prunskiene. Even Dante Fascell, theHouse Foreign Affairs Chairman who hosted breakfast for her,mostly spoke of the things the U.S. couldn't do to help -- noeconomic sanctions, no oil or gas sealift during the Sovietembargo. His proposal to postpone the summit didn't fly withMr. Bush. Mrs. Prunskiene's cause may be just, but what shewants is so very inconvenient.</TEXT></DOC>
