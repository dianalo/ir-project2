The discovery, some 60 miles southeast of Glacier National Park,is reported in the British journal Nature.   The animals lived some 75 million to 80 million years ago, JohnR. Horner, curator of paleontology at the Museum of the Rockies inBozeman, Mont., said in a telephone interview.   Nineteen embryonic skeltons were found in a clutch of eggs laidby a previously unnamed type of dinosaur, which Horner and DavidWeishampel of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine inBaltimore propose calling Orodromeus makelai.   That animal walked on its hind legs and grew perhaps eight feetlong. The embryos would be about eight or nine inches long whenstretched out, Horner said.   Researchers also found parts of seven embryonic skeletons of theduck-billed Maiasaura peeblesorum, which also walked walked on hindlegs and grew to be 30 feet long, he said. The embryos were aboutone foot long, he said.   Juvenile and adult specimens of each dinosaur were found withthe embryos.   Horner said embryonic bones of the newly named dinosaur werevery well developed, while those of the duck-billed dinosaur hadnot developed on the ends.   That is consistent with the notion that hatchlings of the newlynamed dinosaur could leave the nest soon after hatching, whilethose of the other would have been bound to the nest, counting onparents for care, Horner said.   ``An animal that is nest-bound doesn't have to walk around''right after birth, so its bones need not have developed as much bythat time, he said.   Kevin Padian, associate professor of paleontology and biology atthe University of California, Berkeley, said the discovery was``very important'' because few dinosaur embryos have been found.   Last month, other researchers announced they had found adinosaur egg that may contain an embryo some 150 million years old.Studies are continuing, but it does appear to contain an embryo,said paleontologist Wade Miller of Brigham Young University inProvo, Utah.</TEXT></DOC>
