The vote was a sharp setback for both Occhetto and the prospects ofsuccess for the newborn Democratic Party of the Left. Occhetto, who led theCommunists for 2 1/2 years, had been widely expected to be electedsecretary-general of the party that took over from the largest Communist Partyin the West.;    He needed 274 votes, or more than half the 547 partyofficials eligible to vote, but received 264. Of the rest of the 415 whoactually voted, 102 opposed Occhetto, 41 abstained and eight ballots wereblank or nullified. Looking stunned, Occhetto later said he was no longer acandidate, but television commentators said it was possible he might agree torun again if asked. A second vote is scheduled Friday.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  COMMUNIST LEADER SURPRISED IN NEW ITALIANPARTY ELECTION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Foreign News in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910205  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  156  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday February 5, 199100036101,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
