Cohen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> SEC JUS </G><TEXT>   The Securities and Exchange Commission termed &quot;arrogant&quot; a request by attorneys for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to disqualify a federal judge presiding over a massive securities-fraud case brought by the SEC against Drexel and others.    In a filing with the federal appeals court yesterday, the SEC took issue with defense attorneys' allegations that Judge Milton Pollack has a conflict of interest. Defense attorneys for Drexel and three of its employees had asked the appeals court to bar Judge Pollack from hearing the case because his wife, Moselle Pollack, stands to gain about $30 million from a leveraged buy-out which, Drexel said, it is helping to finance.    But the SEC said that the defendants' argument in their extraordinary petition to the federal appeals court &quot;seriously mischaracterizes the connection between Drexel and Mrs. Pollack -- which is at best tangential -- as a close relationship, fraught with the potential for bias and prejudice.&quot;    As previously reported, attorneys for Drexel and other defendants named in a Sept. 7 complaint filed a writ of mandamus, a seldom-used tool, in an effort to get the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan to bar the judge from the case. The defense lawyers said that Judge Pollack's involvement in the case created an &quot;appearance of impropriety.&quot;    The defense attorneys had first asked Judge Pollack to remove himself voluntarily, and he set a hearing on the matter for next Tuesday. But the lawyers argued that by continuing to issue orders in all the cases, Judge Pollack had &quot;in essence denied the pending motion,&quot; and that it was necessary for the appeals court to step in.    Attorneys for plaintiffs in some of the 13 other insider-trading related civil suits pending before Judge Pollack also challenged the defense attorneys' motion to remove the judge. In a separate court filing yesterday, attorneys representing some of the plaintiffs charged that Drexel &quot;used carefully crafted allegations and innuendo to create the appearance of a judicial conflict where none in fact exists.&quot;    According to yesterday's filings by the SEC and some of the plaintiffs in the private actions, Drexel hasn't had any dealings with Mrs. Pollack or with Palais Royal Inc., the Houston-based retail chain she and her family own. Palais Royal is being bought in a leveraged buy-out Drexel is helping to finance.    The filings argue that the transaction, which Drexel agreed to help finance last July, involves an all-cash sale by Mrs. Pollack of her equity in Palais Royal to a company formed by Boston-based Bain Venture Capital, a subsidiary of Bain andamp; Co., the management consulting firm. According to the SEC, Mrs. Pollack and her family will be paid by Bain Venture Capital. Drexel, however, may act as &quot;best efforts&quot; underwriter and placement agent for Bain Venture Capital in connection with Bain's sale to others of certain subordinated debt.    Moreover, the SEC and the plaintiffs' attorneys allege that the same law firm, Cahill Gordon andamp; Reindel, is representing Drexel in the SEC suit, the private cases and the pending buy-out. &quot;Drexel first began discussions with Bain with respect to the placement at the end of July of this year, creating the very situation of which they complain,&quot; the SEC said. But, the SEC added, Drexel and the others waited until last month to ask Judge Pollack to remove himself.    &quot;Their present haste to have this issue heard&quot; by the federal appeals court &quot;is suspect,&quot; the SEC said. Drexel and the others &quot;should not be allowed at this late date to remove Judge Pollack . . . because of their disagreement with his rulings.&quot;    Thomas Curnin, a partner at Cahill Gordon who is representing Drexel, said that Drexel only learned about Mrs. Pollack's involvement on Sept. 9 and promptly contacted Judge Pollack. &quot;The suggestion Drexel created this conflict is preposterous.&quot;    Defense attorneys said they disagreed with the arguments by attorneys for the SEC and other plaintiffs. &quot;They're creating lots of smoke screens and irrelevant contentions,&quot; one attorney said. Defense attorneys also have said that Drexel will own an equity interest in the entity that is buying Palais Royal.    The defense lawyers have opposed from the start the SEC's efforts to have the case heard by Judge Pollack. They have charged that the SEC sought out Judge Pollack because he is viewed by many attorneys as tending to favor the goverment in insider-trading and securities-fraud cases.    The federal court of appeals told attorneys for the defendants and the SEC yesterday that it may hear oral arguments on Drexel's petition tomorrow. </TEXT></DOC>
