Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York said thelate bid for a troy ounce of gold was $365.90, compared with$362.40 late Wednesday.   Traders were not surprised by the currency's retreat after itsrecent rise. ``Everyone was looking for a correction phase tobegin, and it's begun,'' said Jim McGroarty, a senior vicepresident at Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. in Greenwich, Conn.   ``The question is how far (down) do we go?'' he said.   Market strategists expect the dollar-selling to continue asspeculators protect themselves against any hike in Europeaninterest rates over the long Memorial Day weekend, which couldcause the dollar to fall.   A day after British interest rates moved higher, the SwissNational Bank on Thursday announced the introduction of a flexibleLombard rate policy. Dealers said that this daily adjustment of theLombard rate, which acts as a ceiling for Swiss interest rates, wasseen as a prelude to a rate increase.   The Lombard rate is what the central bank charges commercialbanks for supplemental borrowings in which securities are used ascollateral.   ``The Swiss announcement had a psychological impact on themarket after the U.K. rate rise and the continued threat of rateincreases in Japan and West Germany,'' said Joe Leitch, a foreignexchange director at Salomon Brothers International in London.   The Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada and several Europeancentral banks intervened against the dollar shortly after thegovernment announced a downward revision in the nation's grossnational product for the first quarter to 4.3 percent from a 5.5percent estimate.   Overall, however, ``intervention hasn't been all thateffective,'' said Kevin Lawrie, a vice president at the Bank ofBoston. Many who are still bullish on dollar note that it is thecentral bank and not investors who are doing the selling.   ``We have some room to come off a little further still, but nextweek the dollar should resume its upward momentum,'' Lawrie said.   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 142.35 Japanese yen, down 0.65yen from the 19-month high posted Wednesday. Later in London, thedollar fell further to 142.05 yen.
