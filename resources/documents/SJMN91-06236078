Another study was sent to federal environmentalauthorities in July 1990.;   But Linda J. Fisher, the top EPA officialresponsible for pesticide regulation, said studies had been overlooked by heragency until she ordered a review after the state warning was issued.;   Undera provision of the federal pesticide control law, the EPA is supposed toreview such studies as they come in and, if appropriate, issue newregulations.;   State officials and congressional lawmakers said the failureto review and react to the danger notices might have put thousands of peopleand the environment at risk of toxic contamination.;   &quot;This is a completeviolation of congressional intent and is a very dangerous dereliction ofduty,&quot; said Rep. George Brown, D-Colton, a member of the House AgricultureCommittee and an expert on pesticide regulation.;   &quot;We were assured that theEPA could detect, immediately flag and react to new scientific informationindicating a problem with a pesticide. Obviously they are not carrying throughwith their promises and somebody needs to get on it.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910823  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  18E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  350  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, August 23, 199100236078,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
