A memorandum filed in the continuing federal case says that the alleged transfers cost the U.S. government &quot;well into the millions of dollars.&quot;    As previously reported, the grand jury has been investigating the St. Louis-based maker of industrial, consumer and defense products for allegedly using vehicle parts from a Defense Department program in the manufacturing of vehicles being sold to Egypt.    The memorandum, filed Monday in federal court in St. Louis, says the investigation now goes &quot;far beyond&quot; the Egyptian contract and evidence obtained in a government search Feb. 25 of an Emerson plant in Ferguson, Mo. Emerson has asked the court to declare the search illegal.    Emerson said in court papers that such transfers took place within its electronics and space division, but denied any wrongdoing. The company said transfers of parts from one contract to another are a &quot;common practice&quot; and were made with the Defense Department's approval. A company spokesman said Emerson has been cooperating in the federal investigation.    The government memorandum says that &quot;evidence obtained&quot; indicates that &quot;for a substantial period of time, Emerson has been transferring government-paid-for parts to almost all its commercial and foreign contracts, resulting in a financial loss to the government totaling well into the millions of dollars.&quot;    Prosecutors previously filed documents showing that Emerson refunded $214,488 to the government, allegedly to compensate for making unauthorized parts transfers. Emerson maintains the refund relates to parts it transferred between U.S. government contracts, and wasn't an admission that it received money it wasn't entitled to.    Emerson says it was using a &quot;borrow and pay back&quot; system in which it took parts it had bought for U.S military vehicles, and used them to complete production on Egypt-bound vehicles. The company said it also used parts bought under the Egyptian contract for American vehicles. Neither government was cheated under the system, the company said.    An Emerson spokesman said the company's transfer practices actually benefit the U.S. because they &quot;allow the company to reduce overall inventory costs and meet production schedules.&quot; In court filings, the company said it put parts from the Egyptian contract on U.S. military vehicles for that reason.    Emerson maintains the latest allegations of more widespread fraud represents the government's attempt to shift the focus of its investigation away from the Egyptian contract because its case is weak.    The case points up once again the difficulties of prosecuting defense fraud cases. Contractors use a multitude of procedures in the course of business which are often difficult for those outside the industry to understand.    Also, the contractors are often able to show that at least some Defense Department officials knew what they were doing and didn't object, even if other government officials considered their actions improper.    In this case, Emerson submitted a letter to the court from a Defense Department official, indicating that he had said the parts transfer was &quot;conditionally acceptable.&quot; But prosecutors filed another letter, written by the same official a year earlier, in which he told Emerson the practice was &quot;totally unacceptable.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
