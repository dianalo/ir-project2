Before passing the measure on an 86-9 vote, lawmakers rejected an effort to weaken the nuclear-waste provision, which was adopted by the Senate last week and would hasten the search for an underground storage site for nuclear waste. The move to alter the provision failed, 61-34.    The nuclear-waste provision, among others, faces strong opposition from key lawmakers in the House, and parts of the bill are also opposed by Reagan administration officials.    The Senate legislation appropriates $309 million for the Energy Department's share of research on SDI, the so-called Star Wars anti-missile project, $8 million less than last year and $171.6 million less than the president had requested. A bill passed by the House in June allocated $279 million for SDI.    Overall, the Senate bill would spend $7.7 billion for research on and production of nuclear weapons, $267.5 million more than last year and $63.9 million less than the amount the House approved. The increase includes about $25 million for the construction of as many as two new reactors to produce nuclear weapon materials.    The bill also directs that one such reactor currently in operation at Hanford, Wash., be shut down for safety reasons. There is no similar provision in the House bill.    The Senate measure represents a 6.3% increase in new budget authority for federal energy and water programs, or more than $949 million above last year's budget. Included in the bill is $1.2 billion, or $13 million more than last year, for Army Corps of Engineers construction of water projects in 40 states and American Samoa, Guam and Puerto Rico. The Reagan administration objects to several of these projects as uneconomical.    The energy bill is the 10th of the 13 spending bills for the current fiscal year to clear the Senate. Differences between the versions of the bills passed by the House and Senate have yet to be resolved. </TEXT></DOC>
