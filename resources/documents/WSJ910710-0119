The findings appeared to lend weight to arguments thathealth insurance plans affect medical decisions and thequality of care.</LP><TEXT>   Researchers at the federal government's Office ofTechnology Assessment reported that many dialysis patientswhose care was paid for by Medicare in 1989 and 1990 receivedlower doses of the drug erythropoietin, or EPO, than neededto treat their anemia. The report suggested that Medicare'smethod of paying the centers encouraged the underdosing sincethe centers received a flat payment for the drug no matterhow much they used.   Although the reimbursement program for the drug waschanged beginning this past January, the study is the mostrecent in a host of reports suggesting how the government'shuge Medicare program can influence physicians througheconomic incentives. About 110,000 people receive blooddialysis treatment at a cost of about $4 billion to Medicare,and many of those patients receive EPO.   The researchers said that more than half the patientsreceiving EPO at the dialysis centers were still anemic aftersix months of treatment, despite research strongly suggestingthat when the drug is given at higher dosage levels, theanemia disappears. The report, published in the Journal ofthe American Medical Association, said that while centerswere reimbursed a flat rate of $40 for the drug, the centers,on average, administered about $27 worth of drug to thepatients.   EPO is a kidney protein that stimulates the production ofred blood cells. The drug is produced through biotechnologyand marketed as Epogen by Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks, Calif.Approved for sale in 1989, EPO sales have exploded to anannual rate of about $360 million, making it the mostsuccessful biotech drug yet. Patients who lack kidneys, orwhose kidneys are impaired and require dialysis machines tocleanse their blood, often are anemic because they don'tproduce enough EPO on their own.   Jane Sisk, who now works at Columbia University's Schoolof Public Health, and two colleagues who formerly worked atthe Office of Technology Assessment, found that the privatelyowned dialysis centers administered an average dose of about2,700 units of the drug per patient. Amgen charged thecenters about $27, or about $10 per 1,000 units of the drug.Thus, the centers pocketed about $13 per treatment.   Previous research had shown that dialysis patients neededat least 3,000 and sometimes as much as 5,000 units of thedrug to raise their red blood cell level to normal. Under theMedicare system, if the centers administered 5,000 units,costing about $50, they still would have received only $40from Medicare.   The researchers said that between November 1989 and April1990, the average level of red blood cells for patients givenabout 2,700 units of the drug was below normal. A normal redblood cell count, or hematocrit, is 0.3 to 0.36. Theunderdosed patients achieved hematocrit levels of about 0.27,the researchers said.   Ms. Sisk said her study didn't specifically find that thecenters' doctors were underdosing to increase profits. Shenoted that doctors may merely have been starting the patientsat a low dose lest high doses of the drug cause side effects.   Separate findings released at congressional hearings lastyear reported that under the reimbursement program, dialysiscenters were making a 40% profit on the drug by giving lowdoses. As a result, Medicare this year began paying centersfor the cost of the drug prescribed.   An official at the Health Care Financing Administration,which oversees Medicare, said that following thereimbursement change, the dialysis centers are now givingpatients an average of about 3,100 units of EPO. Aspokeswoman at Amgen said a survey it conducted found thatafter the reimbursement change, &quot;we've seen a significantincrease in dosing, a significant increase in the patient'shematocrits.&quot;   Officials at the National Renal Administrators Associationoutside Washington, which represents about half the 1,000dialysis centers in the U.S., couldn't be reached forcomment. But Mardee Hagen, who runs several centers owned bythe University of Utah in Salt Lake City, said many centersinitially gave low doses because &quot;that's what Medicare wantedus to do at first and that's what the reimbursement programencouraged.&quot; She said Medicare officials wanted the centersto keep the dosing low at first because of the drug'sexpense.</TEXT></DOC>
