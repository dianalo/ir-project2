Total short interest among all stocks traded on Nasdaq,the computerized OTC trading system operated by the NationalAssociaton of Securities Dealers, rose in lockstep with theNasdaq Composite Index, which set a record high of 556.17earlier this month before tumbling 6.2% to yesterday's close.</LP><TEXT>   Short interest generally is considered a bet by skepticalinvestors that a stock will fall. Short sellers borrow stockand immediately sell it, betting that they can buy the sharesback later at a lower price to return to the lender. Shortinterest is the number of shares that haven't yet beenpurchased for return to lenders.   Ill-fated Cascade International Inc., whose shares stoppedtrading last week after its chairman vanished, had a 118%climb in short interest. Short sellers were among the firstto warn of trouble at the Boca Raton, Fla., retailer.   Biotechnology stocks -- which tumbled earlier this monthafter peaking in a wave of speculation -- figured prominentlyamong the issues showing large volume rises in shortinterest. Xoma Corp., Centocor Inc. and Synergen Inc. allreported increases in short interest of 650,000 shares ormore. Short interest fell, however, in bellwether Amgen Inc.   Short interest again rose in discount retailer 50-OffStores Inc., one of this year's best-performing stocks. Lastweek, however, the San Antonio, Texas, company'sthird-quarter earnings exceeded Wall Street's expectations.   Employee Benefit Plans Inc., a Minneapolis provider ofmanaged health care services, reported a 152.3% jump in shortinterest. The company's stock slumped last month afterearnings came in below expectations.   Among computer-related stocks, short interest rose inIntel Corp. and Dell Computer Corp., but fell in BorlandInternational Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc., Oracle SystemsCorp. and SynOptics Communications Inc.   The NASD, the self-regulatory body that operates theNasdaq computerized system on which more than 4,650 OTCissues trade, compiles short-interest data in two categories:the approximately 2,600, and generally biggest, Nasdaq stocksthat trade on the National Market System; and the other,generally smaller stocks that don't.   Short interest in those stocks that have led the Nasdaqindex higher -- the largest and higher-quality shares thattrade on the National Market System -- climbed 3% to anall-time high of 334.7 million shares, eclipsing the recordset last month. Short interest in National Market Systemstocks as of mid-November was 334,683,705 shares, comparedwith 324,840,840 for the month-earlier period.   Short interest, however, in smaller issues fell 5.2% aftera 12.7% leap last month. Short interest in 1,254 smallerissues was 34,605,084 shares for the period ended inmid-November, compared with 36,496,951 in 1,218 issues amonth earlier.   By another measure, however -- the short interest ratio --short interest isn't as great a potential influence on theOTC market as it was a year ago. The National Market System'sshort-interest ratio in mid-November eased to 2.24 from 2.49a month earlier and is well below the record short-interestratio of 3.34 set last November. The short-interest ratio forthe smaller issues fell to 0.97 from 1.14.   The ratio -- the number of trading days at the market'saverage volume that would be required to cover the totalshort interest position -- is a measure of negative tradersentiment.   Although a substantial short position reflects heavyspeculation that a stock's price will decline, some investorsconsider an increase in short interest bullish because theborrowed shares eventually must be bought back.   Some short interest doesn't reflect any opinion on a stockat all but shows up as part of another strategy, such asarbitrage or dividend capture.   The following tables show the over-the-counter issues inwhich a short interest position of at least 50,000 sharesexisted at mid-November, or in which the short position hadchanged by at least 25,000 shares since mid-October (seeaccompanying tables -- WSJ Nov. 27, 1991).</TEXT></DOC>
