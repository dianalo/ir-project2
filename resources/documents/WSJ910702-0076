But mostof the changes aren't new. They are simply a collection ofpreviously announced additions and subtractions to its routemap.</LP><TEXT>   The airline already had announced plans to start flying toDallas/Fort Worth, Atlanta and St. Louis later in the summer.The new destinations added by America West are to Houston'sIntercontinental Airport; Boston; Newark, N.J.; and Denverout of America West's Las Vegas, Nev., hub. Similarly,America West's announcement of its plan to drop service tosix airports on Sept. 7 was made before last week'sbankruptcy filing. Those six are New York's LaGuardiaAirport; Bakersfield, Calif.; Palmdale and Santa Barbara,Calif.; Edmonton, Alberta; and the Grand Canyon.   Some analysts, however, say America West should be lookingelsewhere in its route system.   &quot;I would list their Nagoya route and their 747 service,including Hawaii,&quot; said Tim Pettee, a vice president atAlliance Capital Management. &quot;And I'd be looking hard at theEast Coast&quot;   America West, the nation's ninth largest airline, starteddaily flights to Nagoya, Japan, in February. That was duringthe height of the Persian Gulf War, when travelers desertedairlines because of fears of terrorism and the recession. Thecarrier in the spring dropped the number of flights to thriceweekly but recently resumed the daily trips.   The Japan service &quot;has got to be very expensive to serve,&quot;said Edmund Greenslet, a financial analyst who publishesAirline Monitor. &quot;I'm not saying that kind of service can'tbe a major contributor eventually, but can you afford to doit now?&quot;   Similarly, America West's service to Hawaii is usedprimarily for the benefit of frequent flyers, who areredeeming awards for travel on other routes. That means theairline's profit margin on the flight must be very low.Airlines don't give out profit margins on individual routes.   Changing its fleet plan will go a long way toward decidingwhat America West's route structure will look like. Underbankruptcy law, the airline has 60 days to accept or rejectleases on the 115 jets it operates. &quot;I'd look at simplifyingthe fleet and eliminating some fleet types,&quot; said SandyRederer, a Washington, D.C.-based consultant affiliated withWorldwide Transportation Group. &quot;The first thing everyonelooks at are the 747s. They're just a few airplanes, but theycost a lot of money.&quot; America West operates four 747s and hasfour brand-new ones on order for deliveries beginning in1994.   Similarly, the airline last year agreed to acquire up to118 Airbus Industrie A320s, in a transaction in which theaircraft suppliers provide about $220 million in cash andproduct support. Those jets have proved more expensive tointegrate into America West's system than the airlineanticipated. Although it has taken delivery of more than adozen A320s, a number of them still aren't flying.   Lastly, the airline's efforts to penetrate the heavilytraveled East Coast airports such as New York, Baltimore andWashington haven't been very successful. They are allexpensive cities for a smaller airline to operate in and lurepassengers, and America West has two flights to most of thoseairports out of its Phoenix hub.   &quot;You're not in the market unless you have four flights aday,&quot; said Dallas-based airline consultant Hal Salfen.American Airlines, for instance, won't consider starting upservice to a new destination unless it can fly three flightsa day, and its executives prefer to have five or six dailyflights.</TEXT></DOC>
