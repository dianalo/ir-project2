Boeing's announcement followed the cancellation Tuesday of development of a competing engine made by the International Aero Engine consortium.    Both experimental engines are of a type called the propfan, which uses whirling blades to circulate more air and provide greater fuel efficiency than the turbofan engines currently in use.    Boeing had been developing the 7J7, which it plans to bring to market in 1992, with the GE engine. However, Boeing said it recently spent three months testing the engine made by the consortium, which includes United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney division, Rolls-Royce Ltd. of Britain, Japan Aero Engines Corp., Fiat Aviazione S.p.A. of Italy and West Germany's MTU Motoren andamp; Turbinen-Union Muenchen G.m.b.H. Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium, also has been interested in the IAE engine for its high-technology planes.    After a meeting in London, the IAE board said it decided not to proceed with its engine because it couldn't have the engine ready by 1992. In a prepared statement, the board said the engine &quot;concept is not in question.&quot;    However, the statement from Boeing's commercial airplane unit said the Boeing decision to continue with the GE engine was based on the results of its study. In the study, the GE engine had a 9% advantage in fuel savings, Boeing said.    In Hartford, Conn. a spokesman for United Technologies said the consortium had decided not to commit itself fully to developing the superfan engine at this time. The spokesman said IAE expected to develop the superfan engine for use in a Boeing and Airbus aircraft that will be built sometime in the 1990s. These aircraft include a larger version of the Boeing 7J7, the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
