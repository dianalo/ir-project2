(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart onFriday announced his resignation from the Assemblies of God shortlyafter the church said it was defrocking him for rejectingpunishment it had ordered for ``moral failure.''   Swaggart said at a news conference that he knew dismissal wasinevitable but insisted he had no choice but separating from thechurch to save his Bible college and $140 million-a-year worldwideministry.   Shortly before Swaggart made his announcement, the ExecutivePresbytery of the Assemblies of God, headquartered in Springfield,Mo., said it had dismissed him as a minister for refusing to stoppreaching for a year.   It had ordered the punishment after Swaggart voluntarily steppeddown from his pulpit Feb. 21, after a tearful public confession of``moral failure'' before his wife, son and congregation gathered inhis Family Worship Center.   Church officials and Swaggart have refused to elaborate on hismisstep, but a Baton Rouge prostitute has said Swaggart paid her topose nude for him.   ``We believe that to stay out of the public for a year wouldtotally destroy the television ministry and greatly adverselyimpact the college,'' Swaggart said in a statement.   ``Because of the nature of this situation, we are forced to takea position that does not answer all of the questions nor solve allof the problems. But we feel we have no alternative or choice,'' hesaid.   ``Therefore, I must regretfully withdraw from the Assemblies ofGod, understanding that they will have no choice except to dismissme from the fellowship, since I am presently not in good standingwith the fellowship.''   He read from a prepared statement and refused to answerquestions.   In Springfield, the Rev. Everett Stenhouse, assistantsuperintendent of the Assemblies of God, said general presbytorshad read Swaggart's statement before he made it public, so therewas nothing surprising in it.   Stenhouse said the church and Swaggart parted on amicable terms,but Swaggart's chances of returning to the church were slim.   ``It would be a long trail back ... if at all,'' he said.   Swaggart said in the statement that he hoped his college andpreaching would continue to send people into the Assemblies of God.   He said he would stick to the punishment decided by theLouisiana church officials, although it was moot. Under thatpunishment he would not preach sermons until May 22, although hehas been ``witnessing'' at church services.   Swaggart's lawyer, Bill Treeby, was asked if the statement meantSwaggart would form his own church.   ``This ministry is an independent church and always has been,''Treeby said.   Asked if any of the Christian television networks had contactedthem about taking Swaggart off the air, he said, ``We have peoplewho handle that. We're not going to deal with that. If some of themdon't use us, they won't.''   The church's decision to dismiss Swaggart as a minister wasannounced in Springfield by the Rev. G. Raymond Carlson, generalsuperintendent of the church, after he and other members of theExecutive Presbytery met by telephone conference call.   Earlier Friday, the church had received what Carlson describedas a ``gracious'' letter from Swaggart in which the evangelistrefused to accept terms of a church-ordered, two-yearrehabilitation program.   Carlson said he called Swaggart on Friday after the 13-memberExecutive Presbytery, which serves as the board of directors of thechurch, met and made its decision.   ``He received it graciously,'' Carlson said. ``We had prayertogether at the conclusion of our conversation.''   In the statement he read, Carlson referred to remarks Swaggartmade in a column in his magazine, The Evangelist, in August 1987.In it, Carlson said, Swaggart endorsed a one-year ban frompreaching as part of the rehabilitation of any ``fallen churchman.''   Carlson declined to release details of Swaggart's letter. Hesaid that when he talked to him, the evangelist did not explain whyhe was refusing the rehabilitation program.   The leaders of the country's largest Pentecostal denominationand their most prominent minister had been locked in an impassesince an attorney announced last week that Swaggart would defy achurch-directed one-year preaching ban and return to his televisedministry May 22.   Church elders in Louisiana originally recommended that Swaggartbe barred from his pulpit for three months as part of a two-yearrehabilitation plan despite protests from national leaders thatevery other Assemblies minister who had confessed to moral failurewas banned from preaching for at least a year.   The Executive Presbytery recommended the one-year ban and stoodfirm through a challenge to its authority by Louisiana officials.On March 29, the Executive Presbytery's authority to disciplineSwaggart, and the specifics of its rehabilitation plan, wereendorsed by an oversight body, and Louisiana officials laterreconciled themselves to the national plan.   Swaggart's church, television and school complex in Baton Rougehas been shaken by the scandal. Donations are reported down, about100 workers were fired shortly after Swaggart's confession, andstudents at the Jimmy Swaggart Bible College are said to beclamoring to transfer to other religious institutions.   Swaggart's ministry brought in an estimated $142 million lastyear, and his sermons are broadcast in more than 100 countries. TheAssemblies of God received about $12 million a year, in monthlyincrements of $1 million or so, from Swaggart for its foreignmissions program. It has not received anything since his Februaryconfession.   Swaggart has been known for his harsh denunciations of the sinsof others, including PTL founder Jim Bakker, who lost hisAssemblies credentials after a sex-and-money scandal last year, theRev. Marvin Gorman of suburban New Orleans, reportedly hired themen who photographed Swaggart with the woman.   Gorman, also defrocked by the Assemblies, said the action Fridayinvolving Swaggart ``further proves the truth of the allegations Imade'' in a $17 million lawsuit he filed against Swaggart in March1987. In the lawsuit, Gorman blamed Swaggart for destroyingGorman's ministry.</TEXT></DOC>
