The two nations announced Monday that they have agreed tocoordinate the experimental flights over the Arctic in January andFebruary.   S.G. Tilford, director of NASA's Earth science and applicationdivision, told reporters the Soviets and Americans probably willuse separate aircraft for the experiment. But the two groups ofscientists and pilots will share information and coordinate flightschedules.   The mission was announced at a Moscow news conference byAmerican scientists from the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration and Soviet representatives from this country'sAcademy of Sciences.   Tilford said he hopes 10 to 20 flights can be made through theozone layer to collect data.   Tilford said the aircraft have an altitude limit of 12{ miles,but scientists estimate that the hole in the ozone layer extends to31 miles.   He said the U.S. scientists and pilots hope to be basedsomewhere in Norway. It was undecided where the Soviets will bebased, he said, but ``we'll be in close touch, coordinatingschedules and flights.''   Ozone in the atmosphere filters out the sun's ultraviolent rays,making life on Earth possible.   A NASA report in March said the ozone layer over the UnitedStates has shrunk by about 2.3 percent since 1969. The report putthe blame on chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals used to power someaerosol sprays.   They were banned as aerosol propellants in the United States in1978. But they continue to be used to clean computer chips andother electronic parts, as refrigeration fluids and for makingplastic foams.   The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that a 1percent thinning of the Earth's ozone shield means a 5 percent to 6percent increase in skin cancer. If chlorofluorocarbon usecontinued increasing at 2.5 percent per year, EPA said, 20 percentof the ozone barrier could be gone in the next century.   The Soviet Union has several chlorofluorocarbon plants underconstruction and has won several temporary exemptions to a31-nation treaty cutting emissions that damage the ozone layer.   Academy of Sciences spokesman K. Kondratyev said scientistsdiffer on the effects of ozone depletion, but generally believe itcauses an increase in the Earth's temperature, leading todeforestation in tropical areas, reduction in atmospheric moistureand, eventually, deterioration of the Earth's soil.</TEXT></DOC>
