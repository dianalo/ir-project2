Cardin, a former owner of Old Court Savings andamp; Loan Association, was convicted of five counts of theft for stealing $385,000 from the troubled thrift before its collapse in May 1985.    Mr. Cardin, who had an 18% stake in Old Court, was found guilty by a state court jury here of submitting false invoices for services that never were rendered and of embezzling funds from the thrift. He faces a maximum prison sentence of 75 years and a maximum fine of $5,000. He also may be required to make restitution for the $385,000.    Mr. Cardin, 62 years old, declined to comment after the decision was announced. He is the fourth person to be convicted of crimes in connection with the investigation of Old Court's collapse, which triggered a crisis of confidence in Maryland's network of more than 100 privately insured savings institutions. Sentencing for Mr. Cardin is scheduled for Jan. 21. </TEXT></DOC>
