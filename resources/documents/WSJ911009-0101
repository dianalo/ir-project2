Ron Wyden, a co-sponsor of the measure.   FEI declined to confirm that it reversed its position. Butits chief lobbyist, James Kaitz, who in August said the grouplooked favorably on the revised bill, said the bill &quot;isn'tnecessary.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   &quot;FEI's flip-flop on this bill illustrates that financialmanagement wants to appear to be for the public interest butbehind the scenes opposes any efforts to report managementfraud publicly,&quot; said Rep. Wyden. &quot;FEI is putting up a smokescreen for the status quo.&quot;   FEI, which is based in Morristown, N.J., and represents14,000 top financial officials of major U.S. companies,helped kill a similar but more stringent bill last yearsponsored by Rep. Wyden -- by launching a blizzard of lettersthat reduced Congressional support for it.   Rep. Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, said that in his effortsto revive the legislation, he spoke with FEI officials lastyear. As a result of those talks, he says, he agreed todelete a provision in the old bill that would have requiredmanagement to report on the adequacy of a company's internalcontrols. He also agreed to drop from the previous bill aprovision that would have required a company's outsideauditors to attest to management's report on internalcontrols, Rep. Wyden said.   However, the new bill directs the Securities and ExchangeCommission to study whether such reports by management andauditors should be required later on.   Internal controls consist of checks against fraud and lossof funds and assets. If set up correctly, they are safeguardsagainst the mismanagement of the sort that led to recent bankand thrift scandals, accountants say.   Mr. Kaitz, FEI vice president and chief lobbyist inWashington, D.C., said FEI now thinks the proposedlegislation needs more scrutiny. But if Congress decides toenact the bill this session, &quot;we do have specific comments oncertain sections of the bill that we would like changed,&quot; hesaid.   Lambasting FEI's change of heart, Rep. Wyden noted thatMr. Kaitz in August told the Public Accounting Report, anewsletter for accountants, that &quot;most of the issues that wewere concerned about in bill last year have been addressed{in the current bill}. After a preliminary review, we'repositive.&quot;   A position paper that FEI is circulating among itsmembers, obtained by this newspaper, spells out FEI's currentopposition to the bill. Mr. Kaitz said FEI wasn't yet readyto issue a public release.   he new bill would give the SEC the power to set auditingstandards and would permit the SEC to require a company'soutside auditor or another auditing firm to report on anymanagement fraud. FEI opposes these changes.</TEXT></DOC>
