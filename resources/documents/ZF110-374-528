(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Lomet, David B.; Salzberg, Betty.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A new multiattribute search structure, the hB-tree, is introduced.andO;The hB-tree, or holey brick B-tree, is developed from the K-D-Btree of Robinson where the nodes always represent rectangularregions.andP;  In hB-tree, the nodes represent bricks from whichsmaller bricks have been removed.andP;  As a B-tree does, an hB-treegrows from the leaves and all the leaves are at the same level.andO;The hB-tree, which is space and time efficient for any datadistribution, works well for partial match, exact match, and rangesearches, and is competitive with B+-tree performance when used asa single-attribute search method.andP;  The hB-tree can analyze spaceutilization, does not need to know the data distribution ahead oftime, and adjusts gracefully to any incoming data pattern.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     AlgorithmsB-TreesIndexingData Base Management SystemsPerformanceInformation Storage and RetrievalAccess MethodsOperating SystemsFile ManagementTheoretical ResearchData Base DesignSearching.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Clustering a single attribute is compromised in any multiattributeindex.
