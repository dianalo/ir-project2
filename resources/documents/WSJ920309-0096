That bookreminds one of the American propensity to periodically cutthe military, with the result that American boys aresubsequently sent into battle to be slaughtered.   Some 54,000 young men died in Korea in significant measurebecause Louis Johnson, the secretary of defense, and hisboss, President Truman, thought that a defense budget of $12billion ($102 billion in current dollars) was fat and oughtto be cut. Calls to bring the boys home turned the U.S.military establishment -- which had emerged just a few yearsearlier from World War II as the greatest fighting machineever -- into a hollow shell that came perilously close tobeing defeated by North Korea. Are we setting ourselves upfor a repeat?</LP><TEXT>   The president's State of the Union messages proposes a $50billion reduction in the defense budget over the next fiveyears -- a 25% reduction in the armed forces' size (people,divisions, aircraft carriers, etc.). That neo-strategist,Sen. George Mitchell (D., Maine), is prepared to see thepresident and raise him $50 billion. Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.,Mass.), a consistent critic of the defense budget (exceptwhere it would involve closure of Massachusetts defenseindustries), proposes a $210 billion cut over seven years.   As this is an election year, some tolerance is perhaps inorder. But this much? What is the justification for suchmassive cuts? The Soviet threat has greatly diminished, buthas it disappeared?   All the talk in Washington these days is about the benigndemocracies that have suddenly emerged out of the formerSoviet totalitarian state. But there remains a heritage ofsome 70 years of deep animosity; every Soviet schoolchild wastold that the U.S. was its enemy. How soon can that heritagebe turned into attachment to peaceful and democratic values?   It is worth recalling that long before there was a SovietUnion there was a powerful Russian imperial state thatbrooked no democratic nonsense and that repeatedly invadedits neighbors. This has not been a region of the worldcrowned with tranquillity or devoted to democracy.   Perhaps we no longer will need to concern ourselves withviolence by and among the former Soviet republics. Buthistory offers no comfort in this regard. And even BorisYeltsin reminds us just how unstable Russia is by warningthat he could be replaced by a totalitarian government.   Still, neither the Bush administration nor Congress seemsmuch concerned with this turbulent history or the unstablepresent that the Commonwealth of Independent States presents.At least the administration is clear concerning the moreimmediate threat that it perceives to U.S. interests. It isthe regional threat, epitomized by the recent war againstIraq. In this the administration is surely correct.   Iran, Syria, Libya and even Iraq itself remain current andfuture threats. The proliferation of weapons of massdestruction is no fiction. Several states, not only in thatregion but in Northern Asia (North Korea), on the Indiansub-continent (India and Pakistan), and in North Africa,South Africa and parts of Latin America are already engagedin efforts at nuclear weapons production as well asproduction of chemical and biological weapons and the meansof their long-range delivery by ballistic missiles (abettedby such states as China).   This is not a picture of a tranquil world, even if theformer Soviet republics pose no threat at all. Anotherprecipitous dismantling of the U.S. defense establishmentwill in all probability give a future power-hungry dictatorthe incentive to build the forces that can challenge U.S.interests and world stability.   There appears to be a consensus that some reductions arewarranted, especially in modern long-range nuclear deliverysystems. But the administration already plans to go wellbeyond this. Secretary Dick Cheney's Oct. 31 proposalsenvisaged an elimination of one-third of all U.S. Armydivisions, reduction in tactical fighter wings from 36 to 26,and elimination of 100 ships and three aircraft carriers.   It appears that the administration would attempt tomaintain the technological superiority so superbly displayedin the war against Iraq by emphasizing research anddevelopment and then placing the results of that Randamp;D on theshelf to be produced if required in time of need. Howpractical an approach is this?   A recent Johns Hopkins University School of AdvancedInternational Studies monograph notes that it is a myth tobelieve that &quot;we can maintain a viable defense industrialbase by funding Randamp;D but not production. . . . Defensecapability requires production technology and experiencedtechnicians.&quot; It may take years to move from development tomass production.   Were the U.S. to encounter another Iraq, would theconventional forces provided for in administration financing(not to mention the lesser levels implicit in the Mitchelland Kennedy approaches) permit the quick, relativelybloodless victory of Desert Storm? Even with the Reaganbuildup, had Saddam not provided months of valuable time forthe U.S. to raise and deploy forces, Desert Storm might wellhave had a less satisfactory ending. Will the next adversaryoffer a similar warning?   And even if all the assumptions made in theadministration's plans were shown to represent a prudent risk(no military plan can hope to provide for more), will thespecial interests permit a sensible implementation? Thechairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff rightly complains ofhaving to listen to congressional support for lower defensebudgets so long as there are no cuts in the military base inthe particular congressman's district, or the militaryproduction facility in his state, or the local National Guardand reserve units. Is it possible to have 535 secretaries ofdefense and chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and stillhave a rational defense?   Even the most uninformed understand that this is anelection year in a nation plagued by a host of domesticproblems that may consume an increasing share of governmentfunding. Still, is it reasonable to load that entire burdenon the back of the defense budget? That seems to be happeningwithout a voice being raised in honest questioning.   ---   Mr. Weiss, a retired ambassador, directed the StateDepartment's Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs in 1973.
