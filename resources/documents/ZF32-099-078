(portrait)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Borland chairman Philippe Kahn is undoubtedly a happy man.andP;  Just eight yearsago he was an illegal alien in California with an off-the-shelf companyselling tools to computer programmers.andP;  In a few months time, if all goeswell, he will be heading the fourth largest PC software company in the world.andM;But Kahn will have paid a high price for Asahton-Tate -- his company's formerrival -- or more specifically for Ashton-Tate's 3 million dBase users and itsrecently acquired Interbase product.andP;  Borland's offer valued Ashton-Tateshares at $17.50, more than $6 above the pre-offer trading price.andM;He also faces a considerable task in amalgamating the two companies.andP;  Bothhave turnovers of around $230 million, but Borland has long been growingprofitably while Ashton-Tate is only breaking even after several quarters oflosses.andP;  Ashton-Tate employs 1,700 people compared with Borland's 1,000.andP;  &quot;Itmight be good news for Borland and good news for Ashton-Tate shareholders,but it doesn't look too good for Ashton-Tate staff,&quot; said one insider.andM;Borland has made it perfectly clear that rationalisation is inevitable butrefuses to be drawn any further.andM;Neither will Borland comment on the fate of Ashton-Tate's development plansfor dBase.andP;  What will happen to the Windows version for example?andP;  &quot;We don'tknow what's in development at Ashton-Tate, but nothing is going in the bin,&quot;said Borland's UK managing director Rikke Helms.andM;Strange then the speed with which Borland renamed its unreleased Windowsproduct Turbo xBase.andP;  Exactly 24 hours after the takeover announcement, itwas previewed under the name Object dBase.andP;  Even Ashton-Tate UK managingdirector Paul Sloane showed surprise at this -- but then he reportedly foundout about the takeover only 48 hours before the event.andM;And a grinning Richard Schwartz from Borland explained how this would be theupgrade path for both dBase and Borland's own Paradox users.andP;  In themeantime, Borland would continue to support existing dBase versions.andM;But none of this should bother dBase users, according to Jonathon Yarmis,vice president of PCs at the Gartner Group.andP;  &quot;The deal is excellent news forthe users.andP;  The whole question mark over the future of Ashton-Tate has beeneliminated.andP;  The founder might not be driving the product any more but theupgrade path won't be any more or less of a problem,&quot; he said.andM;He agreed that dBase users would be moving up to a Borland product.andP;  &quot;Iexpect Borland will cannibalise bits and pieces of Ashton-Tate's developmentplans,&quot; he said.andM;Several users feel that dBase has come to the end of the line anyway.andP;  JohnFalconer from Shell UK said, &quot;If they couldn't have offered me a Windowsupgrade soon I would probably have switched.&quot;andM;Ashton-Tate bought US-based Interbase, which markets a high-end relationaldatabase, in March this year.andP;  It uses a 'blob', or basic large objectsystem, for storing different types of data.andP;  Ashton-Tate chief executiveBill Lyons said at the time that Interbase would keep his company &quot;at theforefront of client/server computing&quot;.andP;  A sentiment that would appeal toKahn, because Borland is wanting in that department.andM;At the moment Interbase has a user base of just 7,000.andP;  In the short termBorland is likely to use the availability of dBase on mid-range platforms asa springboard to take on the high-end players such as Oracle.andM;Borland can now afford to think big since it will leapfrog overnight to thehead of the league table, behind Microsoft, Lotus and Novell.andM;But the merged company also faces some painful surgery, a point not lost onBorland's rivals.andM;&quot;There's going to be a six month upheaval period which competitors are goingto be well aware of,&quot; said Michael Skok of rival Symantec.andP;  &quot;I have animmense amount of respect for Philippe Kahn but there's a big differencebetween running a one-man visionary operation and heading a globalenterprise.&quot;andM;Having paid so high a price, Borland's shareholders will be expectingresults.andP;  Borland claimed it had been steadily stealing users fromAshton-Tate but not quickly enough for Kahn.andP;  &quot;Kahn probably thought it waseasier to buy the company rather than win the users one by one,&quot; said theGartner Group's Yarmis.andP;  &quot;Borland has probably paid more than it needed to,but if Kahn manages to pull the whole thing off that probably won't matter ina few years.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
