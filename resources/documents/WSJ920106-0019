For example, just who did nail that endangered northernspotted owl to a sign off Hurricane Ridge Road deep in thewoods? Curtis Sauer, a Park Forest ranger, came across theimpaled owl while making his rounds awhile back. A woodenkitchen match protruded from its chest. A hand-lettered signdangled from its neck. &quot;The match has yet to be struck,&quot; thesign warned.</LP><TEXT>   And what is to be made of this flier, fluttering from thegnarled bark of a towering old spruce tree off a back roadnear the Hoh River, a few miles south of Forks? &quot;Whiteloggers, we are with you,&quot; it proclaims. It's from the WhiteAryan Resistance, the violence-prone white-supremacists.   No one hereabouts admits to knowing exactly who postedthese signs. But the message behind both cuts through like achain saw: Here in the self-proclaimed Logging Capital of theWorld, things are getting desperate.   The little spotted owl has been casting a rather largeshadow over Forks and other timber towns throughout theNorthwest for a long time. Environmentalists, wielding theEndangered Species Act and other environmental laws, haveconvinced courts and the federal government to limit loggingon millions of acres of land to help save the reclusivebirds, which nest in old trees. Now the full effect of thoselogging curbs are beginning to take hold, along with the hardrealization that timber jobs lost now are gone for good.Increasingly, logging towns seem headed the way of textiletowns, mining towns, steel towns -- other places that clungtoo long to aging industries and withered as those industriesshut down.   But there is a difference here, one that spawns a bitterblend of anger, frustration and despair. Backwater towns ofthe past were mostly done in by sweeping economic changes,things like automation, foreign competition and shiftingglobal markets. Timber is under pressure from some of thoseforces, too: Many people argue that a number of factors, fromrecession to the dwindling number of large trees, doom theloggers of towns like Forks by the end of the century anyway.   Even so, the decline of the logging towns has been greatlyaccelerated by distant political decisions and courtroomrulings that seem to place more value on the preservation ofa natural resource -- in this case, tall trees that are hometo owls rarely seen even by lifelong residents of the woods-- than on the jobs of thousands of rural workers.   Last year, Forks-area loggers cut fully a third lesstimber than just a year earlier -- the lowest level in 10years -- and things won't be getting better. The reason?&quot;Owls,&quot; says Susan Trettevik of the state's Department ofNatural Resources.   The calculus of owls vs. jobs mystifies and infuriates thepeople of Forks. But it will come increasingly into play asthe growing push to save wildlife continues to crash upagainst the need for growth and jobs. Already, Bushadministration policy makers, led by Interior SecretaryManuel Lujan, are calling for revisions of the EndangeredSpecies Act, citing Forks and other timber towns' travails asevidence that conservation is exacting too high a price oncommerce. With the act up for reauthorization this year, andwith fights over salmon, smelt, gnatcatchers and dozens ofother troubled species looming, the nation is struggling todecide how far to go to save plants and animals, and at whatcost to human beings.   Forks, a soggy little place of 2,500 people where it rains12 feet a year, is living that struggle now. Unemployment is20% and counting -- up from about 10% in 1990 and 7% in 1989.Main Street is a forlorn strip dotted with bare storefronts,such as that of Birdwell Ford, whose manager one morning lastsummer put up a handwritten sign saying &quot;Closed. Moved toPort Angeles,&quot; a town 60 miles away. The sign still danglesin the empty auto showroom, next to an earlier placard: &quot;ThisBusiness Supported By Timber Dollars.&quot;   Crime is rising, spirits sagging. The authorities openlyworry that someone might blow up a ranger station or torchOlympic National Park, a million-acre preserve of ancienthemlock, spruce and fir forever off limits to the saw.Someone already did try to burn down the park's headquarters.And there was this: One day in June, Jeff King, a 31-year oldlogger, former secretary of the Forks Timber Museum, a familyman with a wife and three kids, learned that he wouldprobably soon be laid off from his logging outfit. Thatevening, at home in his living room, he pressed a huntingrifle to his chest and shot himself.   There were other stresses in Mr. King's life besides hiswork, but friends believe losing his job pushed him over theedge. &quot;He couldn't face not being a logger, and he could seelogging coming to an end up here,&quot; says David Westerlund, afriend who spoke to Mr. King 10 minutes before he died. Mr.Westerlund is a logger himself. &quot;Hell, we all know how hefeels -- felt. This whole town feels lost and angry.&quot;   The wounds run so deep partly because of the history ofthis town. Commercial logging began here in the 1860s, and itshaped the town's character. Forks is isolated andconservative, with a reputation for high spirits. It's apatriotic place known throughout the state for itsrip-roaring All American Fourth of July parade. It has lushlyforested Olympic Mountain foothills -- and smolderingclear-cuts that come right down to the main highway. It hasone stoplight and 10 churches and a lot of men with missingfingers, tribute exacted by the woods of those who go thereto work. Once or twice a year, someone from Forks is killedin a logging accident.   All this has given the people of Forks a decidedlydifferent view of the old forests than many people have --particularly environmentalists. &quot;This whole area is just abig old tree farm, is what it is,&quot; says Matt Anderson, aformer logger who now works as an electrician, stating thecommon local view. &quot;We cut down trees, they grow back. What'sthe problem?&quot;   The environmentalists' view, of course, is different. Itis the view from a rutted dirt road in a heavily logged areaof 300-year-old forest near Hunger Mountain, a few miles outof Forks. The area seems to have been bombed. Charredclear-cuts the size of a dozen football fields stretch acrossthe flanks of mountains, everything gone but a few stumps,which are burned along with other debris. Some still smolder,like Ground Zero. Down the side of one mountain runs the scarof a landslide hundreds of yards long, brought on by rainsafter the trees were stripped. The slide has clogged PistolCreek, once a fine little trout stream, with mud and stumps.Trout don't live there anymore.   Elsewhere in this area, salmon spawning grounds have beenburied by logging debris, one reason many species of nativesalmon have gone extinct, and many others are threatened.Throughout the Olympic Peninsula, though there are stillmillions of trees, about 95% of the old-growth spruce,hemlock and fir are gone.   As the owl loses the ancient trees that are its habitatand as vital watercourses are ruined, it is humans thateventually suffer, say conservationists. &quot;On the practicallevel, the damage this kind of intense logging does to thesewatersheds is potentially quite ominous for people who usethem for water and food,&quot; says Kevin Rose, a Park Serviceranger and environmentalist. &quot;On a different plane, there isthe moral question of how we can permit the complete andneedless eradication of trees that have stood for centuries,and entire species of animals.&quot;   Even some people in Forks admit that they cut too hard inrecent years. But the way they see it here, loggers are beingrobbed of a cherished way of life and driven from their homesby a gang of outsiders who just don't understand. Thesepassions pour forth wherever Forks people gather. &quot;These damnpreservationists,&quot; roars Emmett Treicher, leaning into hisbeer at a cafe. &quot;These wimps want to clear us out of here sothey can come up two weeks a year on vacation and admire bigtrees.&quot; Mr. Treicher lost his small logging company last yearand is trying to scrape by doing odd jobs and raisingbuffalo. &quot;We risk life and limb in those woods, and we getpainted as forest rapers and morons. . . . This isn't the wayit's supposed to work in the U.S.A.&quot;   &quot;That's right,&quot; chimes in Kenny Huston, a cowboy fromMontana who came here 10 years ago to drive logging trucksand who's spent most of the past six months out of work. &quot;Ittears at you, not to be able to do what you've want to do toearn a living.&quot; Mr. Huston laments that many outsiders comehere and aren't able to see the forest for the stumps. &quot;I'veseen tourists literally pulled over by the side of the roadtaking pictures of clear-cuts,&quot; he snorts. &quot;You'd thinkthey'd take a picture of all the beautiful trees stillstanding. But they've never seen a clear-cut, and all thosestumps look pretty damn bad. They go home and tell all theirfriends how awful we are for cutting down trees.&quot;   With fewer trees and fewer paychecks being cut in Forks,local businesses are wilting. Receipts from city sales andproperty taxes are way off. In addition to the cardealership, the pet store, the main clothing retailer, themovie theater and half a dozen other businesses have closedin recent months. In the window of Leffler's, the defunctclothing store, hangs a drawing by Johnny Dahlgren, age 7,son of a logger. &quot;An owl needs 2,000 acres to live,&quot; readsthe caption. &quot;Why can't I have room to live?&quot;   Social problems are erupting too. Barbara O'Hara, who runsthe Forks Abuse Center, says domestic violence complaints inthe past year were up more than 100% -- running at astartling 60 a month. &quot;You take away a logger's job, tell himhe can't work, it strips him of his dignity and his manhood,&quot;she figures. &quot;Some men lash out at their wives as a form ofreasserting some power over their own lives.&quot;   One victim tells her story. Her husband, a logger for 15years, had been out of work for much of the previous yearwhen a gyppo outfit (logging lingo for a small independentoperator) that had lined up some state timberland offered hima job. &quot;It was a godsend,&quot; the woman recalls. &quot;We wereselling our furniture to feed our children.&quot; The day beforethe loggers were to start clearing the site, state wildlifeofficials discovered an owl nest nearby and banned cutting.That evening, after a petty argument over lost car keys, thehusband beat the woman, breaking her nose. &quot;He'd never doneanything like that before,&quot; she says. &quot;He cracked. I honestlybelieve the prospect of losing his life's work overwhelmedhim.&quot; The husband has since moved away from Forks. &quot;I don'tknow where he is,&quot; says the woman.   Other crimes are rising too. Vern Johnson, chief ofpolice, says drunk driving arrests have tripled since lastspring. &quot;These people are faced with losing everything, andthey're trying to numb the pain,&quot; Mr. Johnson says.   More troubling, Irene Smith, a school mental-healthcounselor, says at least five children have attempted suicidein the past several months. All were from logging families,and all had seen their fathers lose their jobs. &quot;There is anair of anxiety and fear hanging over this whole town, andthat psychological toll on our children has been horrendous,&quot;Ms. Smith says. The local high school has canceled its coursein logging. Administrators couldn't justify encouragingyoungsters to go into logging.   The sullenness even intruded on the town's Fourth of Julybash last summer. One float after another inched down MainStreet denouncing owls and environmentalists. A hot-rodheaded for the annual demolition derby seemed to sum upForks's mood: Painted in camouflage, it showed Saddam Husseinbeing overrun by U.S. tanks. A caption read: &quot;Tree huggersnext.&quot;   In this charged and edgy atmosphere, Justin Dwyer seesopportunity. Mr. Dwyer, an amiable 23-year-old withclose-cropped brown hair, is Washington state director of theWhite Aryan Resistance. Flanked by two skinhead colleagues ata restaurant across Puget Sound from Seattle, Mr. Dwyerexpounds on what he calls &quot;racialnomics,&quot; a melange ofconservative economics, pro-worker sentiment andgovernment-bashing. He downplays the racist aspect of WhiteAryan Resistance's credo. &quot;Basically, we don't think an owlis worth any white worker's job,&quot; Mr. Dwyer says. &quot;Thegovernment has betrayed the white loggers of this country.&quot;   It says something about the level of desperation in Forksthat Mr. Dwyer and his cohorts think now's the time to mounta recruiting push there, though Forks folks are quick to saythat this won't play in their town.   Many Forks loggers are simply packing up and moving on,following the trees, hoping to get there beforeenvironmentalists do. Dennis Coats grew up in Forks, and wentto work in the woods the day after he graduated from highschool in 1970. Until recently, he could pull in about$30,000 a year. Now he's headed for Alaska, temporarilyleaving his wife, three boys and a father in failing healthto go north to scope things out. &quot;I feel like I'm being runout of my own town,&quot; he says.   He pauses. &quot;You know, I would have been perfectly happy tolive and die right here in this community,&quot; he says. The nextmorning, early, Mr. Coats and his wife JoAnn have a cup ofcoffee in the Pay 'n Serve cafe, hold hands, say goodbye --and Mr. Coats strikes out for Alaska.   For those who stay in Forks, the state has set up programsthat are supposed to retrain displaced loggers for otherwork, like prison guard at the state penitentiary, orrefrigerator repairman.   The program has been a bust. Few loggers in Forks are muchinterested in being anything but loggers, especially whenjobs the state steers them toward pay about half as much.Radd Leighton, a former Forest Service ranger who's a casemanager for the program in Forks, finds this frustrating, butunderstandable. &quot;The woods are a lot more appealing than someplace with fluorescent light bulbs,&quot; he says. &quot;I have yet tosee a bear or a deer or an eagle wander through this office.&quot;   Another problem: Many loggers didn't graduate from highschool; they went straight into the woods as young teenagers.Many need extensive work to bring their reading skills up tosnuff. &quot;These are intelligent people, but their education maybe inadequate, or they just haven't used those skills much,&quot;says Mr. Leighton. &quot;But what do you do with someone who is ahigh-school dropout making $20 an hour, and you're tellinghim he has to study for six months to get up to speed for aGED so he can qualify for a job making $10 an hour? What youdo is watch them hit the door and head for Alaska or Idaho.&quot;   Sandra Kint-Ironhill heads an embryonic economicdevelopment effort aimed at remaking Forks. She talksenthusiastically of bringing in new light industry, ofoffbeat agricultural projects like growing mushrooms, ofretirement resorts and tourism. She has few illusions,however. There's that rain, relentless, day after day afterday. &quot;It takes getting used to.&quot; And on the tourism front,there's a problem of aesthetics. &quot;The first time I saw aclear-cut, I was devastated -- it looked like nuclearholocaust,&quot; she says. &quot;But there's so much more to thiscommunity than clear-cuts.&quot; s   For most people in Forks, tourism and mushroom farmingseem poor substitutes. Joe McReynolds sits in a den festoonedwith timber ornaments -- clocks carved from spruce and yew,paintings of the woods done by his wife, collages of photosof loggers at work. For the first time in nearly 30 years,Mr. McReynolds is out of a job. He thought the gyppo outfithe owns with his sons, which at its peak employed 20 men, hada good chance to win the bidding on 50 acres of statetimberland recently, but wildlife officials found an owl'snest nearby and canceled the sale. &quot;It's just the damndestthing you ever heard of,&quot; he says.   At 62 years old, Mr. McReynolds worries that he's at theend of the line. He owes money on about $1 million ofequipment. Almost everything he ever earned he put back intothe business, and what he did put aside for retirement hasbeen mostly used up paying bills lately. &quot;I have no income,&quot;he says. &quot;I've been cheated out of my livelihood. I'm broke.&quot;   In 1962, Mr. McReynolds and some friends put on anexhibition of logging skills like pole climbing, tree sawingand ax heaving at the Fourth of July festivities. It becamean annual event, a real show-stopper. Last year, he didn'tbother attending the logging show. &quot;It doesn't have the feelit once did,&quot; he says.   He rambles through his den, pointing out a clock carved bya friend. &quot;He got killed in the woods two years ago,&quot; Mr.McReynolds remarks matter-of-factly. He examines a framedcollage of bleary snapshots -- his son with a chain saw, heand the boys dangling from the fat trunk of a spruce, himselfatop a big logging truck.   &quot;Well,&quot; he says, &quot;it was fun while it lasted.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
