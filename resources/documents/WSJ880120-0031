Closely held State Farm said the settlement was reached in a lawsuit filed against the company in U.S. District Court in San Francisco in 1979.    The company disputed an estimate by an attorney for the plaintiffs that the ruling eventually could cost it $300 million in similar settlements with other women. The lawyer, Guy Saperstein, said the settlement may apply to more than 1,100 women who applied for and were denied State Farm jobs from 1974 to 1987. But a State Farm spokesman said the company doesn't think that many women will qualify.    The spokesman said the agreement requires the company to notify women who applied for employment with State Farm in California after 1974. They may submit a claim for damages if they feel they were discriminated against in their applications to be agents.    One of the original plaintiffs, Daisy Jackson of Palo Alto, Calif., died in 1983. Another, Muriel Kraszewski of Long Beach, Calif., works for another insurance company. The third, Wilda Tipton, lives near Oxnard, Calif. She couldn't be reached. </TEXT></DOC>
