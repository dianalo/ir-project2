With a possible war in the Persian Gulf looming just overa week away, a key group of industry officials met in SanFrancisco late last week and into the weekend, hammering outstrategies for the various scenarios that might be played outif Iraq hasn't withdrawn from Kuwait by the Jan. 15 deadlineset by the United Nations Security Council and war erupts.</LP><TEXT>   The strongest recommendation calls for quick use of theStrategic Petroleum Reserve, a move the industry deemsessential both to calm world oil markets and stave offregional dislocations of supply.   &quot;It's the critical cornerstone&quot; of a war strategy, saidLawrence Goldstein, president of the New York research groupPetroleum Industry Research Foundation and a participant atthe meeting.   The group, operating under the auspices of the NationalPetroleum Council in Washington, eventually will have itsfindings presented to Energy Secretary James Watkins, whowill use them as guidance in setting energy policy. Thegroup's report is currently in draft form and subject toreview by the council, an advisory agency made up of thechief executive officers of the nation's largest oilcompanies.   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, the oil industry hastried to prepare for war. Unlike the invasion, &quot;we know thissucker is coming,&quot; said one oil company executive. As aresult, oil companies have diversified sources of supply awayfrom the contentious Middle East area as much as possible,boosted U.S. production and prepared emergency exercises onan individual-company basis as well as collectively with theU.S. Energy Department. Allocation programs in some companiesalready are in place.   Both the industry and government officials also arestudying a plan that would permit the federal government toborrow as many as 50 oil-company executives to streamline theflow of energy in case of a prolonged engagement ordisruption of supply. Such a so-called National DefenseExecutive Reserve involving oil-company executives has beenactivated only twice in U.S. history -- during World War IIand the Korean War. Some of these executives already havebeen identified, government officials say, and legislationwaiving antitrust requirements is being pursued.   Such preparations are critical, but if and when shootingstarts, the oil companies are banking on prompt use of theStrategic Petroleum Reserve to ensure U.S. supply security.&quot;We assume the government will activate SPR,&quot; one executiveof Du Pont Co.'s Conoco Inc. unit said. Adds Tom Burns,director of international economics for Chevron Corp.: &quot;WithOPEC and other world producers already producing flat out,the only quick short-term incremental supply is SPR and othergovernment-held global stocks.&quot;   Oil inventories of individual companies, reticent aboutloading up with oil just in case peace breaks out rather thanwar, are tight or balanced. Some OPEC producers havestockpiled, however, huge quantities of oil on tankers at seaand in terminals on land.   But if a war starts, production from Saudi Arabia coulddecline immediately by an estimated two million barrels aday. The fall in output would occur, industry sources say, ifthe Saudi government follows through on its considerations toclose down several oilfields near Kuwait if that country isinvaded. In an interview, John Easton, the EnergyDepartment's assistant secretary for energy emergencies,declined to confirm or deny whether the Saudis told him ofpotential closures during a recent visit he made to SaudiArabia with Energy Secretary Watkins. But he said, &quot;If theSaudis decide to shut down some fields, the SPR can make itup; that's one of the reasons for proposing the use of SPR.&quot;   The oil companies predict that prices might jump back upto $40 a barrel or higher from around the current mid-20s,and they say that much of what the industry can do on thesupply side, such as kicking up Alaska's production by about200,000 barrels a day, is in the works.   Oil experts say that perhaps another one million barrelsof daily production capacity world-wide could be brought onstream, but that's all. According to a copy of the group'sdraft, entitled &quot;Short-Term Petroleum Outlook -- AnExamination of Projections and Issues,&quot; supply shortfallsmight occur. But if the free market is allowed to prevail,shortages would be localized and could be quickly alleviated,the report says. To head off gasoline lines such as thoseendured during the 1973 and 1979 crises, the draft reportcautions against intervention by either state or federalgovernments.   The draft also calls for prompt waivers to the Jones Act,which dictates that oil moving from one U.S. port to anotherbe sent by U.S.-flagged vessels only. And if the situationbecomes extreme, moves might be made to abolish certainregulations that clean up the environment but reduce theamount of gasoline that can be produced from a barrel ofcrude oil.   The industry group, basically a subcommittee of theNational Petroleum Council, sequestered itself in a40th-floor conference room at Chevron headquarters, debatingthe impact of war on energy needs. A Justice Departmentrepresentative was present to guard against antitrustviolations.   They discussed the most benign of war scenarios, in whichfearful tanker owners would bar their ships from picking upPersian Gulf oil for a short period. They also examined whatthey considered the most extreme possibility, which calledfor a sudden union of Iran and Iraq and closure of the entirePersian Gulf to tanker traffic.</TEXT></DOC>
