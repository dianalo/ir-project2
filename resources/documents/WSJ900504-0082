The bill would eliminate all export controls fromcomputers and other high-technology products that the U.S.and other industrialized democracies currently ship to Chinaand would thus make those products available to the SovietUnion and certain Eastern European countries as well.</LP><TEXT>   The White House is proposing to offer to sell to theSoviets computers that are only half as powerful as thosebeing sold to China. And the administration is insisting thatEastern European countries that want to import the morepowerful computers must agree to certain safeguards againstthe unauthorized use of those products.   The House bill also contains a so-called sunset provisionthat would terminate controls on all 120 currently restrictedproduct categories by Oct. 1, 1992, unless the administrationdeems it necessary for security reasons to reinstate thoserestrictions.   The U.S. can't change such export-control rules unless itdoes so in concert with other allies. The U.S. and its alliesare scheduled to discuss potentially significant changes inthese rules at a high-level meeting of the CoordinatingCommittee for Multilateral Controls, or Cocom, in Paris nextmonth.   The Bush administration said it is opposed to much of theHouse committee's legislation, claiming that its ownproposal, announced Wednesday, is a more effective way ofresponding to political changes in Europe. The Senate BankingCommittee, which has jurisdiction over export regulations,said it won't be ready to begin work on a comparable billuntil next month.   The computer industry expressed support for the Housebill, saying that it addresses the market potential inEastern Europe more effectively than the White House plan.   &quot;It's a bold and necessary step,&quot; said Marian Korenz, thespokeswoman of the Computer and Business EquipmentManufacturers Association.   The Electronic Industries Association, although supportiveof the bill, said it could be improved if it made a clearerdistinction between the so-called dual-use products that haveboth civilian and military applications and those that aremore properly classified as weapons. The electronics industryis concerned that the State Department and the Pentagon,which are responsible for clearing weapons exports, sometimesintrude unnecessarily in the licensing of dual-use items.   The House bill also would create a &quot;license-free zone&quot; inCocom by Sept. 30, 1991. Such an arrangement would enabletechnology producers in the 17 Cocom countries to exchangegoods without any licenses. Although licensing requirementsfor inter-Cocom trade has been reduced in recent years, thecomputer industry is urging that such paper work beeliminated except for the most sensitive products.   The bill also provides for other benefits for exporters,including giving them notice of decisions by Cocom, whichoperates for the most part in secrecy, and periodic reviewsto trim the list of controlled items. The House proposal,moreover, would give a Cocom seat to the Commerce Department,which is directed to weigh both national security andcompetitiveness needs. Currently, the State Department doesmost of the negotiating for the U.S. in Cocom.</TEXT></DOC>
