StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDAMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   Currency dealers reacted negatively to an agreement to cut the U.S. budget deficit, selling the dollar lower in the first full trading day since the plan was announced Friday.    During the three weeks that White House and congressional negotiators were struggling to reach a deficit-reduction agreement, foreign exchange traders maintained that a bipartisan plan to significantly narrow the budget gap would relieve pressure on the dollar and possibly enable the U.S. currency to stabilize or strengthen. But the plan that finally emerged from Washington didn't appear to help the dollar yesterday.    &quot;We got the budget agreement, but people are disappointed&quot; in the size of the proposed deficit reduction, Charles A. Spence, vice president, foreign exchange, at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said. The bipartisan proposal to cut the deficit by $30 billion in fiscal 1988, which began Oct. 1, is &quot;not that much larger&quot; than the $23 billion cut required by the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law, he said.    The negative reaction to the budget proposal -- which also would trim the deficit by $45 billion in fiscal 1989 -- appeared as trading began yesterday in Asia. The dollar opened lower and fell almost continuously until around midday in European trading, when dealers took profits by buying back dollars sold earlier at higher levels.    Then the dollar turned back downward to set new lows for the day until profit-taking on foreign currencies brought another round of buying in New York.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.6737 West German marks, down 0.5% from 1.6825 late Friday, and 134.78 Japanese yen, off 0.6% from 135.55.    The dollar was quoted at 134.75 yen in early Tokyo trading Tuesday.    Many traders said a full reaction to the budget plan wouldn't be seen in the currency markets until today, because the Tokyo market was closed yesterday for a holiday. Several New York traders said they were keeping a low profile in the market until they see how the budget plan is received by Japanese traders and investors.    &quot;People would like to see the Japanese attitude toward the budget plan, because Tokyo is a big creditor&quot; of the U.S., Masakazu Miyamori, senior vice president and chief trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd.'s New York branch, said. &quot;I don't think they'll show a positive posture,&quot; he said.    Mr. Miyamori said the plan has been criticized in the Japanese press and is viewed as a disappointment because it relied partly on one-time savings, through $5 billion in asset sales, to attain the $30 billion deficit reduction in the first year. The lack of an income tax increase also was viewed as a weakness, he said.    &quot;The $30 billion amount is a good size, but the details are disappointing,&quot; Mr. Miyamori said.    John J. McCarthy, vice president, foriegn exchange, at Irving Trust Co., New York, said the the market appeared unimpressed yesterday because the final proposal had been well publicized by negotiators before Friday's announcement.    &quot;The market had already priced what has turned out to be a disappointing package into exchange rates,&quot; he said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $5.80 an ounce to $475.40 in heavy trading. Estimated volume was six million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $473.25 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Monday, Nov. 23, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
