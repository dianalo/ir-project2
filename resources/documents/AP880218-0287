At the same time, USAir Group Inc., one of the nation'sfastest-growing airlines, reported slightly lower fourth-quarterearnings but record earnings for the year, during which it acquiredtwo other carriers.   Pan Am's losses, reported against a background oflabor-management feuding, an executive shakeup and an impendingstrike this weekend, bring the venerable airline company's lossesto more than $883 million in the past four years.   The quarterly loss was 24 percent higher than the $197.5 millionloss in the same quarter of 1986, although the yearly loss wasabout 43 percent lower than the 1986 loss of $462.8 million. Still,Pan Am officials expressed alarm.   ``Last year's results are terribly disappointing for thecompany,'' said Thomas G. Plaskett, who was elected chairman of PanAm last month.   ``A loss of this magnitude underscores the urgent need for PanAm to lower its current operating costs and revitalize itsmarketing and revenue-generating programs,'' Plaskett said in astatement.   Fourth-quarter revenues totaled $877.1 million, up 9.8 percentfrom $798.6 million in the same quarter of 1986. For the year,revenues totaled $3.59 billion, up 18.2 percent from $3.04 billionin 1986.   Aside from blaming labor costs, which are among the highest inthe industry, Pan Am said the losses last year were aggravated by$42 million in ``increased allowances for inventory obsolescence,uncollectible receivables, and costs associated with the WorldPassfrequent-flier program.''   Such programs, offered by all major carriers, attempt to gainrepeat customers by offering them free trips after they fly acertain number of miles. USAir Group said its 1987 fourth-quarterearnings totaled $26.7 million or 62 cents a share, a 16.6 percentdrop from the $32 million or $1.06 a share reported a year earlier.The company had 43.19 million shares outstanding in the 1987quarter vs. 31.73 million a year earlier.   Quarterly revenues totaled $1.12 billion, more than double the$483.38 million reported a year earlier.   For all of 1987, USAir said it earned a record $194.64 millionor $5.28 a share, nearly double the $98.35 million or $3.34 a shareearned in 1986. Revenues totaled a record $3 billion vs. $1.83billion, a 63.5 percent gain.   USAir Group is an airline holding company that includes USAir,Pacific Southwest Airlines and Piedmont Aviation. PSA was acquiredin May 1987 and Piedmont was purchased in November 1987.   The company said its financial statement reflected theconsolidated results of all three airlines for the months followingthe acquisitions, as well as USAir's equity stake in Piedmont priorto the completion of that acquisition.</TEXT></DOC>
