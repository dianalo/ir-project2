In/sup 54/Mn/sup 2+/ solution during its concentration by ''carrier-freeisotope'' sorption on Fe/sub 2/O/sub 3/ and HO /sup 54/Mn/sup 83,49/are detected which costitute totally 25 % of initial /sup 54/Mn/sup 2+/.The method of temperature effect on sorption is developed. Accordingto experimental data changes in /sup 54/Mn/sup 2+/ sorption on Fe/sub2/O/sub 3/ at 26, 40 and 50 deg C using the method of temperature coefficientthe values of {Delta}H/sup 0/, {Delta}/sup 0/ and {Delta}G/sup 0/ sorptionequal to -12.6 kJ/mol, -34 J/mol x deg and -55.2 kandless;J/mol are evaluated.The process of /sup 54/Mn/sup 2+/ sorption on Fe/sub 2/O/sub 3/ and HOis considered as interaction of MnOH/sup +/ hydroxocomplex with sorbentsurface with the formation of coordination ol-bond between sorbent andsorbate.</TEXT></DOC>
