The agreement between the academy and the Natural ResourcesDefense Council also calls for research help in minimizing the usein appliances of the chlorofluorocarbon refrigeration fluids, whichas gases help destroy the earth's protective ozone layer.   Those gases contribute to the expected warming of the earth, butthe major source of that warming will be carbon dioxide formed bythe combustion of fossil fuels.   The United States and the Soviet Union together probably accountfor almost half the world's emissions of carbon dioxide, thecouncil said.   Among other things, the agreement calls for construction of abuilding technology demonstration center in the Soviet Union,visits to U.S. sources of information, demonstration ofretrofitting energy-saving devices such as insulating windows toresidential buildings in the Soviet Union and drafting modelbuilding codes.   The agreement was signed in Moscow last Friday by the council'sexecutive director, John Adams, and academy official YevgheniyVelikov.   The Soviet Union is believed to be one of the world's mostenergy-inefficient economies because most energy use is notregulated through a market.   ``Many families still use open windows to regulate thetemperature in their centrally heated apartments, even in the deadof the Soviet winter,'' the Worldwatch Institute said in its 1988``State of the World'' volume.   While U.S. energy efficiency improved 23 percent from 1973 to1985 and Japanese efficiency improved 31 percent, Soviet efficiencydid not improve at all, Worldwatch said.   The institute, a Washington environmental policy research andadvocacy organization, has estimated that the Soviet economy usesabout 45 megajoules (12.5 kilowatt hours or almost 43,000 BTUs) perdollar of gross national product, 60 percent more than the U.S.economy in 1985 and more than three times the comparable figure forWest Germany.   The Natural Resources Defense Council, founded in 1972, is aprivate group based in Washington and New York that does researchand advocacy on behalf of environmental causes. It is perhaps bestknown for its frequently successful litigation against governmentagencies. One survey two years ago by the magazine ``EnvironmentalForum'' concluded that it was the most effective of all theenvironmental groups that lobby Congress.   It has engaged in joint research with Soviet scientists onquestions of verification of arms control agreements.</TEXT></DOC>
