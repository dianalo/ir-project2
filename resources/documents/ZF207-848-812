(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>HOW TO GET MORE FROM MCI MAILandM;It happens to every MCI Mail subscriber sometime.andP;  You have a proposal thatmust be delivered tomorrow, but you don't finish it until 10 P.M.andP;  Faxtransmission won't yield the high quality output that you need, by now it'sfar too late for your usual overnight delivery service, and yourcorrespondent doesn't subscribe to MCI Mail.andM;The choices in this situation seem limited: Use a messenger service atpremium rates or miss the deadline.andP;  But if you're one of the roughly 100,000subscribers to MCI Mail, there's a third choice.andP;  You can send the text toMCI by modem.andP;  MCI Mail will make a high-quality print on its own laserprinters and will deliver the document anywhere in the United States by 5P.M.andP;  the next business day.andM;If you aren't familiar with this electronic delivery option, you're notalone.andP;  Many people, including many MCI Mail subscribers, think of MCI Mailonly as an electronic mail system--an impression kept alive at least in partby MCI's failure to document their services thoroughly.andP;  MCI offers moreelectronic mail features than most people realize, but it also offersalternative delivery options such as telex, fax transmission, andinternational courier service.andM;WHAT MCI OFFERSandM;Here are short descriptions of some of the most useful MCI features, alongwith MCI Help commands that can give you more information on each one.andP;  Thebox on page 102 tells more about how to use the MCI Mail Help commands.andM;Stand-alone fax machines have several noteworthy limitations.andP;  It'stime-consuming to print a memo or spreadsheet and then feed the pages througha fax scanner.andP;  If you get a busy signal or have a transmission problem, withmost fax machines you have to keep trying manually or else you have to tie upyour fax machine while it keeps trying.andP;  If you have to fax the same documentto several people, most fax machines require that you send each copymanually.andM;MCI Mail, on the other hand, can send an electronic letter to as many as 100fax machines.andP;  As with all messages on MCI Mail, you can either type the textat the keyboard or send it as a file.andP;  By default, MCI Mail will keep tryingto deliver the message for four hours, although you can set that period foranywhere from 30 minutes to 12 hours.andP;  The system will automatically confirmdelivery or notify you of a failure.andM;In addition to saving time and effort, MCI Mail can save money.andP;  At 50 centsfor the first half page and 30 cents for each additional half page, sendingdocuments by MCI Mail within the continental United States can cost less thanthe price of a long distance phone call.andP;  Prices outside the United Statesare higher, but may still be less expensive than a phone call.andM;Be aware that faxes sent via MCI Mail can contain only text.andP;  You can'tinclude a 1-2-3 graph, for example.andP;  And MCI Mail can send to Group 3 faxmachines only.andP;  This should not be a problem, however, since the vastmajority of fax machines in use today are Group 3 machines.andM;For more information about sending documents via MCI Mail, enter help fax atthe MCI Mail prompt.andM;RECEIVING FAXESandM;Because fax transmission sends a picture of printed output rather than theASCII text that computers can understand, you generally cannot receive faxesthrough MCI Mail.andP;  However, PAN FaxMail offers a service through MCI thatscans a fax, uses optical character-recognition technology to convert the faxinto ASCII text, and delivers the converted document to your MCI mailbox.andM;The conversion is not 100% reliable.andP;  The service claims better than 99%accuracy for most common typefaces, but the accuracy drops somewhat forproportionally-spaced type and dramatically for exotic typefaces such as OldEnglish.andP;  Purely graphic information, such as signatures, letterheads, anddrawings, is ignored.andM;For further information, contact PAN FaxMail through MCI (ID: 373-1774) or byphone at 215-584-0300.andM;WORKSHEETS AND OTHERandM;BINARY FILESandM;MCI Mail won't let you send a worksheet, graphics, or formattedword-processor file through a standard communications program such asCrosstalk Mk.4 or Procomm.andP;  But there are other programs that will let youperform these operations by taking advantage of the system's file-transfercapability.andP;  One such program is Lotus Express, available either from MCIMail or Lotus.andP;  Note that to transfer a file with Express, both the senderand the recipient must use the program.andM;Even if you're not interested in the file-transfer capability of Express, youmight want this $150 program as an alternate interface.andP;  MCI has no menusoutside of its Help facility, and its on-line text editor is cumbersome.andO;With Express you never have to see the MCI Mail interface or its editor.andO;Instead, you give commands to Express, and Express communicates with MCI Mailto automatically send and receive your mail.andM;Express provides 1-2-3-style menus to choose from, and a built-in text editorthat lets you write a message as easily as you might with a word processor.andO;Alternatively, it can import a text file.andP;  Once a message is written orimported, you can send it with just two keystrokes.andP;  Also, a $10 add-on toExpress, called Soft Fax for Lotus Express; makes it easier to send faxes byproviding a series of self-explanatory prompts for addressing the message.andM;For more information about Express, contact MCI Mail customer service at800-444-6245, Lotus Direct at 800-345-1043, or a Lotus-authorized reseller.andM;DOW JONES NEWS/RETRIEVALandM;Dow Jones News/Retrieval is one of the most popular business and financialonline information systems.andP;  It currently offers more than 20 services,including stock quotes, airline schedules, weather, general news, andbusiness news from The Wall Street Journal, Barron's National Business andFinancial Weekly, and the Dow Jones News Service.andM;MCI Mail subscribers automatically have access to Dow Jones News/Retrievalwithout paying Dow Jone's annual fee.andP;  However, the usual Dow Jones connectcharges apply, at rates ranging from 13 cents per minute to $2.80 per minute,depending on access baud rate, corporate or standard membership, and time ofday.andP;  Simply enter doujones at the MCI Mail menu.andP;  To return to MCI Mail,enter disc--short for disconnect.andP;  The charges will show up on your MCI Mailbill.andM;For more information, enter help dow jones at the MCI Mail prompt.andM;SEND TO OTHER E-MAIL SYSTEMSandM;One limitation of electronic mail systems is the difficulty of exchangingE-mail messages with individuals who subscribe to other systems.andP;  MCI Mailpartially overcomes this by offering mail connections to several othersystems, including CompuServe, Missive (in France), Dialcom, Telemail, andthe electronic mail services used at corporations such as Digital, IBM, andWang, with still other connections to come.andP;  With each new connection, thechances increase that a client or associate will be a subscriber to a systemthat MCI can reach.andM;For those systems that MCI Mail does not normally reach, DA Systems Inc.andO;offers DASnet to MCI Mail subscribers.andP;  With DASnet you can communicate withabout 20 additional on-line systems, including ATandamp;T Mail, EasyLink, and TheSource, through MCI Mail.andP;  DASnet acts as an intermediary, forwarding MCIMail as appropriate.andP;  As you would expect, there is a charge for the DASnetservice over and above standard MCI Mail charges.andM;For more information about reaching other E-mail services, enter help addressEMS or help address X400 at the MCI Mail prompt.andP;  For more on DASnet, contactDASnet through MCI (ID: 304-0160) or by phone at 408-559-7434.andM;COURIER AND POSTAL DELIVERYandM;As noted earlier, MCI Mail can print your messages on its own laser printersand deliver the paper copy by courier service.andP;  A message posted by 11 P.M.andO;Eastern time Monday through Friday is guaranteed delivery within thecontinental United States by 5 P.M.andP;  Eastern time on the next business day.andO;Delivery is guaranteed by noon in most metropolitan areas.andP;  A message postedover a weekend is delivered on Tuesday.andP;  The price is $9 for the first sixpages and $1 for each additional three pages.andP;  Courier service is availableto about 100 countries, but prices vary outside the continental UnitedStates.andM;Alternatively, MCI can mail a printed message anywhere in the world.andP;  Thiscan speed delivery substantially compared to mailing a letter yourself, sinceMCI prints the letter and mails it from the print center nearest therecipient.andP;  For example, mailing a letter from New York to California canoften take five days.andP;  But sending it through MCI Mail, which prints theletter and mails it in California, can cut the time to one or two days.andP;  Forpostal delivery within the continental United States, the charge is $2 forthe first three pages and $1 for each additional three pages.andM;For details on prices, availability, and the time required for courier orpostal delivery to any given country, enter help followed by the name of thecountry at the MCI Mail prompt.andM;PERSONALIZED TRANSMISSIONSandM;When printing paper copy for courier or postal delivery, MCI can add yourletterhead and signature.andP;  If you use the MCI standard command-based service,called advanced service, you can register up to 15 graphics, includingletterheads and graphic renditions of signatures, at $20 each.andP;  You canchoose which ones you want to use for any message.andP;  If you opt for themenu-based service, called basic service, you can register one graphic.andM;For more information, you can enter help graphics or help graphics scan atthe MCI Mail prompt.andM;Telex is based on an old and slow technology, but it is still the mostwidespread standard for international communications.andP;  In fact, according toThe Complete MCI Mail Handbook (Bantam Computer Books, New York) there aresome countries in which telex is the only dependable service forinternational communications.andP;  MCI Mail will let you hook into the worldwidetelex network without having to buy a telex machine.andM;You can both send and receive telex messages on MCI Mail.andP;  When sending, thesystem will confirm delivery of each message or notify you of a failure.andO;Your MCI Mail telex number is 650 followed, without a space, by your MCI IDnumber without its hyphen.andM;For more information, enter help telex at the MCI Mail prompt.andM;DISTRIBUTION LISTSandM;MCI's distribution list option lets you send a message to as many as 100recipients just as easily as sending to one.andP;  If you write to a large groupregularly, such as all your company's sales representatives, you can createand save a list containing all the names.andP;  From then on, you can address themessage to everyone at once by using the list name.andM;For each entry on a distribution list, you can use any delivery option.andP;  So,if some recipients are on MCI Mail, others use fax machines, and still othersneed paper copies delivered, you can still send the message to the entiregroup at once.andP;  Another nice touch is that each entry can be its own list.andO;This means you can, for example, maintain a list of sales representatives onone list and include that list as a single entry on a larger distributionlist.andP;  However, the total number of recipients per message is limited to 100.andM;In contrast, a distribution list can also consist of a single name.andP;  This isuseful for addresses that are long enough to be a chore to enter--for telexor postal delivery, for example.andP;  enter the address as a list of one, and youcan address future messages by using the list name of 2 to 20 characters.andM;You can also share distribution lists--with others in your office, forexample.andP;  As the creator, or owner, of the list, you can designate who elsecan use it and who gets charged for using it.andM;For more on distribution lists, enter help lists at the MCI Mail prompt.andM;Marc Davidson is a frequent contributor to LOTUS.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
