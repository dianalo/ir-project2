Schlesinger   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/26/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B5</SO><CO>   JAPAN AAPL</CO><IN>COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)</IN><LP>   TOKYO -- After years of low visibility in Japan, AppleComputer Inc. is scrambling to boost its presence here --pumping up personal computer sales, seeking potentialpartners and courting investors.   &quot;We're growing at over a 100% rate&quot; annually in Japan,said John Sculley, Apple's chief executive officer. &quot;AppleJapan will be our largest subsidiary outside of the U.S.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The company's board of directors is meeting for the firsttime at Apple Japan's headquarters this week, and Mr. Sculleywill present to them his blueprint for boosting Japanesesales to $1 billion annually by the mid-1990s, up from about$250 million currently. Mr. Sculley also is visiting Japanfor the listing this month of Apple's stock on the TokyoStock Exchange.   Apple is among the most prominent of a growing group ofAmerican hardware and software PC companies jumping into theJapanese market.   The Japanese PC market is far less developed than eitherthe U.S. or European markets, but many analysts think salesin Japan are taking off, presenting a wide opportunity forU.S. companies such as Apple -- particularly as their homemarket slows down. &quot;The market for the Apple Macintosh inJapan has so far largely been personal users andenthusiasts,&quot; said David Ushijima, who is helping to launch aJapanese version of Macworld, an Apple computing magazine, inNovember. &quot;There's now a shift toward professional buyers andbusiness people.&quot;   Apple set up its Japanese subsidiary in 1983, but got offto a slow start, running through four presidents in its earlyyears, offering only limited Japanese language capabilitiesand charging prices considered high even for the expensiveJapanese market.   Now its strategy is changing. The company lured a Japaneseexecutive away from Toshiba Corp. to run its Tokyooperations, and has a lineup of Japanese language products.While there has traditionally been a lag between introducingnew products in the U.S. and in Japan, this year's newproducts will come out in Japan &quot;almost simultaneously&quot; withthe U.S., executives say.   In addition to increasing sales, Mr. Sculley indicated heis looking for more Japanese partnerships, possibly forsharing technology. He said Apple has a &quot;treasure chest&quot; oftechnologies to offer possible partners, although he declinedto give details. He added that he was particularly interestedin the Japanese strengths in &quot;miniaturizing&quot; computers intolaptops and notebooks.   Although Mr. Sculley said Apple doesn't need more capital,he hopes the listing on the Tokyo exchange will draw moreJapanese investment. In the U.S., he said, &quot;hi-tech stocksare trading stocks. I prefer to see investors in it for thelong term. One of the things I admire about Japanese industryis its ability to invest in building.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
