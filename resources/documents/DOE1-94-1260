It is experimentally found that withinthe increase of carbonate concentration in solution, distribution coefficientreduces due to formation of uranyltricarbonate complex unsorbed by titaniumhydroxide. It is shown that uranyl tricarbonate form dissociation representsthe sorption limiting stage; basic kinetic parameters of the processare determined.</TEXT></DOC>
