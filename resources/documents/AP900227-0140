Federico Mayor said the fast-changing Eastern European pressneeds help to overcome many obstacles, identified by visitngeditors as outmoded equipment, shortages of cash and newsprint andthe need to train a new generation of journalists.   ``The media are the arteries through which democracy passes, themeans by which people are informed, policies questioned, two-waycommunication assured, political abuses checked _ provided that themedia are free, independent and diverse,'' Mayor said.   The head of the United Nations Educational, Scientific andCultural Organization made his remarks at the opening of a two-dayconference, initiated by Western press organizations to addressmedia needs in Eastern Europe.   Media leaders from 15 Western nations including the UnitedStates and Canada attended the UNESCO conference along withjournalists from Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, East Germany, Romania,Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.   The problems in establishing free and independent media in thesecountries were considerable, Mayor said, ``particularly when thereis no historical memory of freedom, when the political culture hasto be acquired from the beginning.''   Mayor said the West could help in five areas: offering advice,pooling information to avoid duplication, providing access to newtechnologies, training journalists and establishing permanentinstitutional contacts.   Several Eastern European speakers appealed for assistance.   ``We do not have the most elementary practical skill,'' saidErnest Skalski, editor of the Polish newspaper Gazeta. ``We don'tknow how to sell newspapers, we don't know about advertising, wedon't have computers. ... I came here to learn how to get help.''   Miroslav Philip, editor of the Czech weekly Reporter Magazine,spoke of the ``catastrophic backwardness of our equipment. We wantto modernize with the help of our neighbors.''   Encho Gospodinov of the Bulgarian publication Pogled said manynew papers in his country could be profitable if they had morenewsprint. He also said they lack hard currency to purchasecomputers and other equipment.   Other speakers advocated regional approaches.   ``We have to come together and understand each other if we arenot to lose the new freedoms we have. ... The time has come forjoint publications and joint television programs,'' said VitalyKorotich, editor of the Soviet weekly Ogonyok.</TEXT></DOC>
