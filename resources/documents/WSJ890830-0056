Mr. Isaac made the tough decision in 1984 to cover even the biggest deposits in the bank, though the government supposedly insures them only to $100,000. Scores of thrifts and banks with billions in deposits at Continental might go down too, he feared -- and with them, much of the deposit-insurance system.    As it turned out, most of those banks and thrifts failed anyway, for other reasons. If he had pulled the plug at Continental Illinois, Mr. Isaac now reasons, the government might have been forced to deal much sooner with the savings-and-loan insurance crisis, saving taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.    Mr. Isaac's second thoughts about the Continental Illinois bailout are part of a new consensus that the nation's deposit-insurance system has run out of control. Only yesterday, in fact, Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, called for cutting back federal deposit insurance, perhaps by limiting coverage to $25,000 per account.    Born in the Depression with the modest aim of protecting Mom and Pop depositors, deposit insurance has grown into a monster that defends major depositors at banks deemed &quot;too big to fail.&quot; Out of fairness, regulators routinely back all deposits at most other banks as well.    Regulatory precedent and policy have rendered meaningless the limit emblazoned in every bank lobby in the country: &quot;Each depositor insured to $100,000.&quot; In practice, the only depositors held by regulators to the $100,000 cutoff are those with their money in certain small institutions that can't be sold. Thus, deposit insurance now protects the nation's biggest and most sophisticated investors. And as hundreds of failed thrifts have lately proved, deposit insurance gives bankers the license to bet big, with taxpayers covering the risk.    The Bush administration and Congress failed to address this rock-bottom cause of the thrift crisis in their efforts to get a bailout bill through Congress quickly. &quot;I'm incredulous that Congress didn't deal in the bailout with one of the fundamental causes of the problem,&quot; says Rep. Jim Leach (R., Iowa), who voted against the bill partly because it didn't revise deposit insurance.    Now that the immediate crisis has passed, policy makers are beginning to explore ways of taming the deposit-insurance monster -- all with the intent of reducing the risk faced by the FDIC, which would turn to the taxpayer for any losses it was unable to absorb. The Treasury Department is directing an 18-month study that will become the basis for any insurance-reform package. The FDIC is analyzing ways of adjusting the premiums that banks pay into the insurance system according to the industry's fortunes. Some lawmakers are discussing a proposal to protect individuals -- rather than individual savings accounts -- to a total of $100,000.    Bankers, for their part, are trying to head off new regulations by proposing their own limitations on deposit insurance. For instance, many support proposals to give depositors a &quot;haircut&quot; -- a 10% or 15% loss on deposits above the $100,000 level -- when a bank fails. Two of banking's biggest guns, Citicorp Chairman John Reed and Chase Manhattan President Thomas Lebrecque, support variations of this proposal.    Almost everyone agrees that dramatic, fundamental changes -- such as lowering the $100,000 insurance limit or wholly renouncing the &quot;too-big-to-fail&quot; policy -- aren't in the offing. For one thing, the system has more populist appeal than ever, now that the government has made thrift depositors whole in the savings-and-loan crisis. &quot;Next to Social Security, deposit insurance is the government program least likely to be changed or tampered with,&quot; says William Seidman, the current FDIC chief.    Moreover, the thrift crisis reduced the options for change by vaulting deposit insurance to a new level of political delicacy. Regulators worry that harsh new restrictions could cause runs. And the issue is a classic candidate for congressional inaction because it is so complex and involves so many powerful lobbies. &quot;The inertia of doing nothing predominates,&quot; says Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), a member of the House Banking Committee.    Mr. Schumer should know, after failing to get the rollback of one small but growing corner of the deposit-insurance system. Bank regulators now openly extend insurance to long-term pension fund deposits -- in amounts up to $100,000 times the number of beneficiaries in the pension fund. Already, some $3 billion of deposits in these so-called Bank Investment Contracts, or BICs, are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Offering this protection to institutional investors will help banks grab even more of the $150 billion market for pension-fund deposits currently dominated by insurance companies.    With banks now holding $2.3 trillion in deposits, tossing in another $150 billion would hardly imperil the financial system. But Mr. Schumer worries that the failure of his efforts to roll back such protections means Congress isn't ready to adopt meaningful changes.    For all its reluctance to address the issue, Congress could be forced to take up deposit insurance as early as next year, when large banks attempt another attack on the Glass-Steagall Act, which restricts them from the securities business. With radical changes highly unlikely, specialists already are exploring politically palatable ways of revising the system.    Academics, lawmakers and industry officials are studying ways to encourage &quot;depositor discipline,&quot; such as exposing a small percentage of deposits over $100,000 to the threat of loss. This, the theory goes, would force depositors to make judgments about the soundness of their banks. &quot;The debate is fundamentally divided between people who think depositor discipline is a good idea and those who think it's a waste of time,&quot; says Robert Litan, a Brookings Institution scholar.    The FDIC's Mr. Seidman, for one, puts himself in the latter category. &quot;We have a hard enough time figuring out a bank's financial condition. I don't see how you can expect a depositor to do it,&quot; he says.    Many specialists argue not for fiddling with deposit insurance, but for making banking practices safer to begin with. Brookings's Mr. Litan and others would force banks to carry assets at market value. This, they say, would make regulators less apt to find that an institution reporting a slight insolvency is actually billions in the hole -- as was true in some of the worst thrift cases. The U.S. could also better afford to maintain the current liberal insurance system if regulators were forced by law to shut down institutions when they become insolvent, rather than letting them accumulate more red ink.    While these proposals have some support in Congress, they face tough opposition from the industry. &quot;Bankers aren't worried about market-value accounting; they're freaked out about it,&quot; Mr. Litan says. Concedes James McLaughlin, a top official of the American Bankers Association: &quot;I don't think you'll see the industry proposing those ideas or supporting them.&quot;    Mr. Isaac, the former FDIC chief, backs the idea of a 15% &quot;haircut&quot; for big depositors. In any case, he says, the current system of making good on every deposit will only lead to more failures. &quot;We need to have an alternative that is less draconian than paying off the insured accounts and letting everybody else -- and maybe a chunk of the U.S. financial system -- twist in the wind,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
