MARTIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nude drawings of women that countyofficials ordered removed from a courthouse gallery cannot bebarred from the exhibit, a federal judge ruled today.   Judge Edwin M. Kosik's order allows the works by artist JosephRay to be hung immediately, and they could be put back up today,said American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Stefan Presser.   ``This is what makes us different from the Soviet Union. We'renot supposed to have Big Brother saying, `You can look atlandscapes, and you can't look at nudes,''' Presser said.   Ray, an East Stroudsburg artist and psychology professor, hungthe nudes in a display of 50 charcoal drawings Feb. 5. The show atthe courthouse lasts until Feb. 26.   Monroe County commissioners and President Judge James R. Marshobjected to the nudes, and Ray agreed to remove them because he didnot want to jeopardize the rest of the exhibit. But he sued countyofficials.   Ray argued that his rights under the First and 14th amendmentswere violated when his paintings were barred from public display.   Kosik, ruling after a half-hour hearing, said the Fred M. WaringGallery in the courthouse was well-established and could not becensored. County officials established the gallery about 10 yearsago.   ``They have indeed elected to enlighten or otherwise to open thepublic court as a designated forum ... for the display of art,''Kosik said.   Daniel M. Corveleyn, assistant county solicitor, had argued theart should be screened because people often had to pass the galleryfor court business and not by choice.   He later said the commissioners would not appeal the ruling.   Ray sought unspecified damages, but that was not addressed inKosik's ruling.</TEXT></DOC>
