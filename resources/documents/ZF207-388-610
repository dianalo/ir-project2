Taft IV ordered all DOD program managers torequire CALS standards in future RFPS.andM;The options requested by the Defense Department include asking contractors totell DOD what they can do to create their data once and use it many times,allowing for government access to the contractor's data system so DOD canreceive data on line, and receiving deliverable data in digital form.andM;McGrath said one of CALS major goals is broadening access to the 200 millionengineering drawings in service repositories.andM;He said another goal is to automate the updating of the services' technicalmanuals.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
