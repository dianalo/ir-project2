El Paso Natural Gas, the21,000-mile pipeline network linking gas-rich New Mexico togas-hungry California, will be:   A. Spun off to shareholders by its parent BurlingtonResources.</LP><TEXT>   B. Sold to another company.   C. Disposed of somehow.   While C is just about a sure thing, A is the method onwhich Wall Street and the pipeline industry are betting. ButB might, in time, deserve bonus points.   Rumors won't go away that Houston-based Coastal wants tobuy the pipeline -- especially now that it has given up onbuilding its own pipeline to California. &quot;There has been aserious data exchange between the two companies&quot; in recentweeks, says an oil company executive familiar with El Paso.   At Coastal, &quot;there is a level of activity that wouldindicate they are preparing for something big,&quot; says anexecutive at another Houston pipeline company.   Curiously, a Coastal acquisition of El Paso could bebullish for both Coastal and Burlington, analysts say. WallStreet adores the management of Coastal, which generallyavoids acquisitions that would dilute shareholders'interests. With a deal, Coastal could acquire a lot of cashflow. Even though its debt exceeds 60% of capital, Coastalshouldn't have any trouble raising cash. &quot;A dozen banks wouldrise to the occasion because they're so confident in themanagement,&quot; asserts one Houston investment banker.   Most analysts say a &quot;separation&quot; of El Paso isn't yetfully reflected in Burlington stock, now at 40. A split-upwould prompt investors to focus more closely on Burlington'sMeridian Oil. By taking advantage of tax breaks and newtechnology in New Mexico gas drilling, Meridian has becomeone of the nation's fastest-growing independent explorers andproducers.   A price for El Paso is tough to gauge. At the high end,Shearson's Daniel Tulis figures El Paso's book value at $1.5billion. With a healthy premium it could sell for $1.8billion, he says, plus the assumption of $850 million ofdebt. Others envision a price of $1 billion or less. Why thewide discrepancy? Some think Burlington might shift some ofits own debt to El Paso before shedding it -- or unbundle thepipeline subsidiary from gas properties currently under itscontrol.   Coastal covets a pipeline that moves gas to California,and was even ready to build one for $650 million until rivalprojects forced it to shelve the plan. &quot;There's no question{California} is a growing gas market,&quot; says James R. Paul,Coastal's chief executive officer.   Environmental pressures are boosting demand for gas.&quot;California is the last, best growth market left for naturalgas,&quot; says Ronald Barone of Kidder Peabody. Gas also is usedto push up the state's heavy oil from underground. Last year,El Paso provided 54% of all the gas consumed in California,and 75% of the gas moving through its pipeline system wasCalifornia-bound.   Oscar Wyatt, Coastal's aggressive chairman, has made manyattempts -- some successful -- to expand Coastal throughacquisitions; El Paso seems a logical fit. &quot;We've heardrumblings of that for some time,&quot; says a vice president atanother Southwest-based pipeline company. Of course, &quot;everytime you hear a rumor about a pipeline being up for sale,Oscar's name is always mentioned,&quot; another industry expertsays.   Mr. Paul, citing long-time company practice, won't commenton the rumors. He says that in today's partially deregulatedpipeline industry, Coastal can sell gas to California withouthaving to own the pipe. Burlington isn't talking much either,except to say that it asked the Internal Revenue Service torule on whether a spinoff of El Paso would be tax-free.Burlington says it hopes to hear from the IRS this summer butcan't be certain.   Burlington itself was born in a spinoff from theBurlington Northern railroad in late 1988, which was precededby a small initial public offering. Many expect a similarroute for El Paso. &quot;That's a reasonable expectation, but it'snot the only way the company can separate,&quot; says Burlington'sspokesman. Another way would be to find a &quot;strategic buyer.&quot;   Though Burlington's intentions have been known for sometime, David Bradshaw of PaineWebber thinks an El Paso spinoffcould be worth $10 a share to Burlington's current holdersand isn't yet fully reflected in the shares. Burlington, hesays, has &quot;one of the most shareholder-oriented managementsI've ever come across.&quot; A sale to another company could beeven more bullish, because it's the unexpected outcome.   Shearson's Mr. Tulis says that Coastal is loath to paypremium prices. He speculates that a stock swap of some kindbetween Coastal and Burlington could overcome that roadblock.   ---   Robert Johnson contributed to this column.   ---   Coastal Corp.
