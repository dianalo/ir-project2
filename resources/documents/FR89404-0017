NR 418.06 isan SO<T2>2</T2> rule which is only applicable to the Badger Paper Mills facility,located in the City of Peshtigo, Marinette County, Wisconsin.\1\<NOTE/> In a June 28, 1985, letter USEPA notified the WDNR that itsJanuary 15, 1985, submittal was approvable (1) if certain rule modificationswere made (i.e, revision of the boiler limit and the other sources limit,establishment of an evaporator building roof vent limit, and eliminationof the alternative control options) and (2) if an acceptable complianceplan (test methods and procedures) was submitted. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ In an October 9, 1985, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice (50 FR 41139), the City of Peshtigo inMarinette County was designated from attainment to primary and secondarynonattainment for SO<T2>2</T2> pursuant to Section 107(e) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. andSection;7407(e). See 40 CFR 81.350. The State withdrew NR 418.06 to make the required modifications. On December1, 1987, the WDNR submitted a revised NR 418.06. <ITAG tagnum="84">Description of the Rules and USEPA's Evaluation </ITAG>Section NR 418.06 (1). The following emission limits are set forth in this Subsection:<ITAG tagnum="15">Liquid fossil fuel and natural gas fired steam generating boilerswith an emission point above ground of less than 55 feet_0.520 pounds ofSO</ITAG><T2>2</T2> per million British Thermal Units (lbs/MMBTU). <ITAG tagnum="15">Liquid fossil fuel, natural gas, and wood refuse fired steam generatingboilers with an emission point above ground of more than 149 feet_0.520lbs/MMBTU. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Spent sulfite liquid incinerators and evaporation plants emittingfrom a point 197 feet or more above ground_1,682.00 pounds of SO</ITAG><T2>2</T2> per hour and 35,184.00 pounds of SO<T2>2</T2> in any 24 hours. <ITAG tagnum="15">Pulp digesters emitting from a point 100 feet or more above ground_300.00pounds of SO</ITAG><T2>2</T2> in any 3 hours and 1,365.00 pounds of SO<T2>2</T2> in any 24 hours. <ITAG tagnum="15">Air contact evaporators emitting from a point 35 feet or more aboveground_33.02 pounds of SO</ITAG><T2>2</T2> per hour and 686.88 pounds of SO<T2>2</T2> in any 24 hours. <ITAG tagnum="15">Evaporator buildings emitting from a point 87 feet or more above ground_6.10pounds of SO</ITAG><T2>2</T2> per hour.All other sources_total of 0.72 pounds of SO<T2>2</T2> per hour. Wisconsin submitted a dispersion modeling analysis (based on the IndustrialSource Complex model) which demonstrated that Wisconsin's plan for Peshtigoassures the attainment and maintenance of the SO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS. This modeling analysis is based on USEPA's modeling guidelineswhich were in place at the time the analysis was performed (i.e., ``Guidelineon Air Quality Models,'' April 1978 and ``Regional Workshops on Air QualityModeling: A Summary Report,'' April 1981). Since that time, revisions tothe modeling guidelines have been promulgated ``Guideline on Air QualityModels (Revised),'' July 1986 (September 9, 1986) and ``Supplement A tothe Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised),'' July 1987 (January 6,1988). Because the modeling was initiated prior to the latest revisionof the guidelines, USEPA accepts the analysis as it stands. USEPA is approvingthese emission limits. Section NR 418.06 (2) This Subsection includes various compliance dates for each of the aboveemission limits (except for the ``all other sources'' limit where immediatecompliance was required). The final compliance date is November 20, 1986.USEPA is approving these dates. (Note: because all dates are in the past,an assessment of expeditiousness is moot.)Section NR 418.06(3)This subsection requires Badger Paper to prepare and maintain a compliancedemonstration plan to assure continuous compliance with the emission limitsin section NR 418.06(1). USEPA is approving this requirement. However,by approving this provision, USEPA is only approving the State requirementto establish a compliance demonstration plan and is not approving the specificplan itself. Further, Wisconsin has not submitted its Badger Paper compliancedemonstration plan as a revision to its SIP.Instead, the WDNR notified USEPA on May 28, 1987, that ``* * * a sourcecan be required to perform a compliance stack test regardless of a source'scompliance status as determined by the source site specific complianceplan * * * .'' The current federally approved SIP includes a stack testat section NR 439 (formerly NR 154.06), which follows the methods requiredor approved by USEPA. Even though Badger Paper and WDNR have developeda site specific compliance plan for Badger Paper Mills (pursuant to NR418.06(3)), this plan was not submitted by the State and will not be includedin the SIP. The only compliance test method in the SIP applicable to BadgerPaper Mills will remain a stack test. This method is acceptable to USEPA;and, thus, USEPA is approving this Subsection.Section NR 418.06(4)This subsection requires maintenance of existing stack heights. USEPA isapproving this Subsection.However, USEPA notes that the Wisconsin's Peshtigo plan is based on twostack modifications. USEPA has reviewed these in relationship to its July8, 1985 (50 FR 27892), Stack Height Regulations.\2\<NOTE/> One modification is that the evaporator plant stack is beingincreased from 106 feet to 197 feet. This new height is less than the <T3>de minimis </T3>213-foot level in USEPA's July 8, 1985, stack heightrules and is, therefore, creditable.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ USEPA's July 8, 1985, stack height regulations apply tostacks (and sources) which came into existence, and dispersion techniquesimplemented on or after December 31, 1970. Stack height credit for thepurpose of establishing an emission limitation is generally restrictedto GEP, i.e., the greater of 213 feet [65 meters (m)] or the GEP formulaheight (40 CFR 51.100(ii)). Credit for merged stacks is generally prohibitedwith the following four exceptions: <ITAG tagnum="28">(1) where total plant wide allowable S0</ITAG><T2>2 </T2>emissions do not exceed 5000 tons per year, <ITAG tagnum="28">(2) where the stack was originally designed and constructed with mergedgas streams, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(3) where such merging was before July 8, 1985, and was part of achange in operation that: (i) included the installation of emissions controlequipment or was carried out for sound economic or engineering reasons,and (ii) did not result in an increase in the emission limitation or (ifno limit was in existence prior to merging) in the actual emissions, or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(4) where such merging was after July 8, 1985, and was part of a changein operation at the facility that includes the installation of pollutioncontrols and is accompanied by a net reduction in the allowable emissionsfor the pollutant affected by the change in operation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Certain provisions of these rules were remanded to USEPA in </ITAG><T3>NRDC v. Thomas,</T3> 838 F.2d 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1988). These are: grandfatheringstack height credits for sources who raise their stacks prior to October1, 1983, up to the height permitted by GEP formula height [40 CFR 51.100(kk)(2)];dispersion credit for sources originally designed and constructed withmerged or multi-flue stacks [40 CFR 51.100(hh)(22)(ii)(A)]; and grandfatheringcredit for the refined (H+1.5L) formula height for sources unable to showreliance on the original (2.5H) formula [40 CFR 51.100(ii)(2)]. These remandedprovisions are not applicable to today's proposed rulemaking.The two 80 feet digester blow stacks are being replaced by one 100-footstack. This height too is less than 213 feet and is creditable. As to themerged stack issue, the new 100-foot stack has SO<T2>2</T2> pollution control equipment installed and has reduced emissions.The merging is, therefore,  creditable under USEPA's July 8, 1985, regulations.USEPA is approving credit for these changes.Because USEPA considers today's action noncontroversial and routine, weare approving it today without prior proposal. The action will become effectiveJune 5, 1989. However, if we receive notice by May 4, 1989 that someonewishes to submit critical comments, then USEPA will publish: (1) A noticethat withdraws the action, and (2) a notice that begins a new rulemakingby proposing the action and establishing a comment period. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Under 5 U.S.C. section 605(b), the Administrator has certified that SIPapprovals do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. (See 46 FR 8709).Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by June 5, 1989. This action may not be challenged later in theproceedings to enforce its requirements.
