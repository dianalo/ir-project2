Moscow sent a hard-line Politburo member, Yegor Ligachev, to EastBerlin. The Soviet government denied Ligachev's trip was to discussthe refugee issue, but it was presumed the subject would be raised.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a newsbriefing Hungary had taken ``an unusual and unexpected step'' byallowing the Germans to go West. He added: ``The Hungarian newsagency has said that Hungary is not responsible for that situation.''   Hungary on Sunday broke with East Germany, a Warsaw Pact ally,and announced that East Germans were free to cross into the West.Thousands of East Germans took advantage of the offer.   V. Kondratyev, a reporter for Soviet state-run television basedin Bonn, said on the evening newscast ``Vremya'' that the exodus wasdesigned by West Germans ``to destablize the G.D.R. (GermanDemocratic Republic) authorities, create conditions for spittingsocialist friendship and for German reunification.''   As ``Vremya'' showed East Germans packing into cars, Kondratyevsaid the ``forbidden soil'' of the West was apparently a prime luredrawing East Germans.   ``Some (East German) citizens want to see the world, to quicklyobtain a car and home and other good things,'' the reporter said.``Some are acting on political motives.''   He said some West Germans are trying to attract their Easternneighbors by portraying East Germany as ``a country without afuture.''   Gerasimov, chatting with reporters, said the East Germans do notmerit being called refugees.   ``They don't have the status of refugees. Refugees are people whoare under political or religious persecution. I don't think they canclaim that ... They simply want to move.''   Gerasimov scoffed when a reporter asked if the Hungarian decisionwas a humanitarian act.   ``I believe there are legal ways to leave the country,''Gerasimov said. ``There's no reason to take the route via Hungary.''   Asked if the Kremlin was worried about the exodus, he answered:`Naturally there is some concern about this situation.'' But he thenadded: ``Although our allies are in question here, this does notaffect us directly.''</TEXT></DOC>
