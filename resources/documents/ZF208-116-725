 We in the computer business get too hung up on SQL and LU6.2.andP;  The most important thing we can do is to help insulate the vastmajority of current or future users of computers from the technical jargon.andM;While we've all been saying that computers are getting easier and easier tolearn and use, we probably take steps backwards in usability as we move fromthe stand-alone environment to the connectivity environment.andM;GCN: What is Ashton-Tate Corp.'s part in SQL Server?andM;ESBER: We have the retail distribution rights to SQL Server.andP;  We're in apartnership with Microsoft [Corp.] and Sybase [Inc.].andP;  We're very pleased tohave Lotus [Development Corp.] join the party in the sense that they'veinvested in Sybase, and I believe they will concentrate on making their linkswith SQL Server the best links they have.andM;GCN: When do you expect dBase IV for SQL Server to be available?andM;ESBER: People ask when we are going to ship a front end.andP;  Well, that's notdoing dBase IV justice.andP;  DBase is not just a front end.andP;  It has a back endand a front end, but it can also treat the SQL Server as its engine.andM;We're making no predictions right now about shipment dates.andP;  I can only tellyou that in the very near future, we anticipate going to beta test on someversions of dBase IV 1.1.andM;We have announced we will break the product up into the Server Edition andjust dBase IV 1.1.andP;  The Server Edition will talk to SQL Server.andP;  It uses theRational Systems [Inc.] technology and will require an 80286 or 80386.andM;GCN: What new features can people look for in standard Version 1.1?andM;ESBER: There are several new language additions to that product, many ofwhich were asked for by our language advisory board, called dLab.andP;  Itcontains some of our most vocal critics but also some of the deepest powerusers of dBase.andM;Obviously we've speeded up performance.andP;  We've fixed any anomalies that havebeen found in the past.andM;GCN: Will the bugs in Version 1.0 be fixed?andM;ESBER: If chief executive officers that have any software on the market donot say there are some bugs in their products, they're liars, quite frankly.andO;Software's getting very, very complex.andP;  I am not heartened by the industry'stendency to judge a product by one or two problems rather than by itsrobustness and all the things it brings to bear.andM;GCN: Do you think dBase IV has been unjustly criticized?andM;ESBER: Well, it depends on what &quot;unjustly&quot; means.andP;  If there's a bug thatsomebody's brought to people's attention, that's just.andP;  If people judge theproduct as completely buggy by one or two bugs, that's totally unjust.andM;DBase IV is in the hands of many people.andP;  I wish I had a thousand productslike it.andP;  It is either the top-selling or the second largest-sellingmicrocomputer database product in history, and the perception is not quite upto that reality.andP;  All too often the movies of some of the people quoted arenot analyzed.andM;To give you an example, the founders of a company that makes a product calledDQuery put our product through a test and pointed out two bugs in our queryfacility.andP;  That made front-page news.andP;  We ran their product through a testand found 150 bugs.andP;  I've never seen that printed.andM;I'm not here to trash my competitors' products.andP;  It's not the way to sell.andP;  Ionly wish the standards that are applied to the leaders in the business areapplied to other people who like to throw barbs.andM;GCN: How about upgrades of some of your other products?andM;ESBER: We are very close to new releases on a number of products.andP;  Over thenext six to nine months you will see, in essence, new releases of every oneof our products.andM;GCN: Can you give us some idea of dBase IV's acceptance in the government?andM;SCHIFF: The sales this year have been strong for dBase III Plus.andP;  DBase IV iscoming on very strong in the last two or three months, and I think by the endof this year you'll see it slip to 50-50.andM;GCN: What percentage of your business is government?andM;SCHIFF: In rough terms it's probably around the 15 percent level.andM;GCN: Aside from dBase and MultiMate, how to Ashton-Tate's other products fitinto your overall strategy for serving the government?andM;ESBER: We need to have a presence across the major horizontal categories ofsoftware.andP;  Clearly, we're known most for the microcomputer database andsecond for MultiMate.andP;  But we intend to have a presence in all the horizontalmarkets to some degree.andM;We think we have the best word processor and spreadsheet in the Macintoshmarket.andM;GCN: How about your strategy for the dBase clones?andM;ESBER: I wouldn't say we necessarily have a strategy vis-a-vis the dBaseclones.andP;  We have a position.andP;  The position is that the dBase clone vendorshave infringed our technological rights, and we're in the courtroom rightnow.andM;Ashton-Tate is highly supportive of third parties who build products that addcapability to our products and complement them.andP;  We are not supportive ofpeople who clone our products.andM;GCN: When will we see dBase versions for other platforms, particularly UNIXsystems?andM;ESBER: We have stated very clearly that we intend to bring the dBaseapplications development environment to other operating systems.andP;  We have arelationship with Digital Equipment Corp. that will result in the productline, certainly dBase, moving to UNIX on the VAX.andM;We're on record supporting Sun [Microsystems Inc.] with Open Look, and Ithink you can expect to see the dBase environment moving to other operatingsystems over time.andM;GCN&quot; How do you see the health of the micro industry over the next few years?andM;ESBER: Fairly healthy.andP;  I guess the market as I see it today sends up a lotof caution signs.andP;  The customer is confused.andP;  I think the buying cycles havebeen extended quite a bit.andP;  Software vendors have not delivered products thatcatch up with yesterday's hardware, let alone tomorrows's hardware.andM;So I do see a slowdown in demand.andP;  The industry has experienced some of thatin the later half of this year.andP;  Although I'd love to be optimistic about thegrowth of the market next year, I'm taking a cautionary posture there.andM;We are continuing to spend a very high amount on Randamp;D to build our productsfor the machines of tomorrow, but let's face it, OS/2 has not gone up like arocket.andM;I don't particularly think that's IBM's or Microsoft's fault.andP;  By and large,most software vendors have found it much tougher building the proper softwarefor the graphical user interface environment represented by OS/2 PresentationManager.andM;There have been a plethora of UNIX environments announced, and no clearwinner.andP;  You have wild cards out there.andM;Steve Jobs has the Next Step operating system, and in my opinion that's oneof the best software development environments around for software vendors.andM;GCN: When do you think OS/2 will be firmly entrenched?andM;ESBER: I don't know about firmly entrenched.andP;  I don't expect the market forOS/2 PM, for instance, to begin to take off until late 1990 and into 1991.andO;The reason I pick that time frame is that it probably won't be until thesecond half of next year that the majority of applications from the leadingvendors are out for PM.andM;You'll see pieces of product lines come out, but until that time I don'tbelieve standard applications will be available in PM.andP;  That will cause OS/2PM to accelrate and eventually pass MS-DOS.andM;But in terms of the installed base, you're probably talking into the low tomid-1990s before it's very prevalent.andP;  There are 25 million MS-DOS machinesout there.andP;  A lot of people are very happy with what they can do.andP;  We in theindustry get fascinated by technology.andP;  We think because there is somethingnew and hot out there, the consumer is going to love it.andM;GCN: Do you think the market for software is going to pick up gradually?andM;ESBER: Obviously software is becoming more and more of the reason to buysomething, and that bodes well for it.andP;  In studying the differences betweencharacter- and graphics-based environments, one tends to find a higher numberof applications per user in a graphics environment than in a character-basedenvironment.andP;  So those trends are healthy.andM;Another trend that's healthy for Ashton-Tate is that as we move to aconnected environment, more people will want to be hooked to a database.andP;  Sothe database market has one of the highest growth rates in the future.andM;GCN: What do you think about doing business with the government?andM;ESBER: We realize you cannot approach government business the same way youapproach business on the commercial side.andP;  There are procedures and rules andprocess to follow.andM;While public perception is not favorable on the efficiency of certain areasof government, we believe computers and the type of software we provide cancontribute to greater efficiency.andM;So I guess I like to look at it through rose-colored glasses and say thattogether we can do better in providing services to the American public.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
