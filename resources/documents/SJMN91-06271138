That's a lot like a slide projector.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BRING THE DRIVE-IN TO YOUR DRIVEWAY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Video  </MEMO><TEXT>     The XV-120ZU isn't much larger than a slide projector, although it weighs27 pounds. Even at 27 pounds, this SharpVision is the most portable videoprojector on the market. It's so portable, you can carry it into the backyardand project videos on the side of your house. For the ultimate drive-ineffect, set it on top of your car with a portable VCR, plug the sound outputinto your car stereo, sit in the car, neck and watch the picture on yourgarage door. The XV-120ZU can project a picture up to eight feet acrossdiagonally on any white wall or movie screen.;   Sharp's the best;   It's notsurprising this LCD video projector comes from Sharp. The company is the worldleader in color LCDs.;   Conventional video projectors weigh more than twiceas much as the SharpVision and require careful setup and positioning. Motionand/or vibration can disturb the critical alignment of a tube-type videoprojector.;   Sharp manages to shrink the video projector with a trio of LCDpanels, one for each primary color. Just as LCDs shrink TV sets, they alsoshrink video projectors. These light, thin LCD panels are permanently fastenedtogether in perfect alignment; only a severe shock would disturb it.;   Thetubes in conventional projectors can't be permanently aligned. The alignmentprocess, called convergence, must be performed each time you move a tube unit,and often realignment must be performed as the unit ages.;   The XV-120ZUsimply projects video. It contains no TV tuner and no audio circuitry. It hasfour video inputs, two conventional video jacks and two &quot;S&quot; jacks. With fourinputs you can connect two conventional sources, such as a TV tuner andregular VCR, and two &quot;S&quot; sources, such as S-VHS and some newer laserdiscplayers.;   You focus the projector by twisting the lens barrel. Although theXV-120ZU uses the &quot;S&quot; input from a high-resolution video source, the projectedresolution is less than that available from the source. You can set upXV-120ZU in less than five minutes.;   The picture quality far surpassesSharp's previous XV-100 model, which remains in the line at $500 less.;   Notexactly affordable;   At a suggested retail price of $4,000 the XV-120ZU willfind its way into more boardrooms and business facilities than back yards.Most tube-type projectors produce a better image with higher resolution. Butthe XVB-120ZU is the best LCD projector available.;   It promises the mostromantic, most private drive-in movies you could ever envision.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RICH WARREN, Chicago Tribune  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910927  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  48  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  479  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, September 27, 199100271138,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
