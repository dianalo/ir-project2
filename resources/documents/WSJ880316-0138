The gathering promises to be a showdown between Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti and the Franco-Belgian alliance fighting him for control of the big Belgian holding company. Both camps requested the meeting in the hope of clarifying the balance of power between them.    Mr. De Benedetti and his allies claim to own about 48% of Generale de Belgique's extended share capital. The Franco-Belgian group says it has a 50.7% stake in Generale de Belgique, and that it has thwarted Mr. De Benedetti's bid for control. But analysts said Mr. De Benedetti hoped some companies in the rival group would back his proposals at the meeting.    Among the items on the agenda will be the Franco-Belgian group's proposals for board members and a proposal by Mr. De Benedetti's camp that he and his main Belgian allies -- Flemish industrialist Andre Leysen and Pierre Scohier, managing chairman of the holding company Cie. Belge de Participations Paribas N.V., or Cobepa -- be appointed to the board. </TEXT></DOC>
