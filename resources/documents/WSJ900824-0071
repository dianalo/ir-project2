The &quot;flight-to-quality&quot; buying spree was evident in pricequotes posted for long-term securities relative to short-termsecurities.</LP><TEXT>   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, for example, fell3/4 points for a loss of about $7.50 for a bond with a $1,000face amount. The issue's closing yield jumped to 9.13%, thehighest on the bond since April 14, 1989 when it was 9.14%,according to Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.   Short-term Treasury notes and bills, however, endedunchanged or modestly higher in brisk trading. Dealers saidinvestors decided to flee the battered stock market andunwind their money-losing long-term bond positions, usingproceeds to buy short-term securities. As a result, pricesfor two-year Treasury notes held firm and the yield wasunchanged at 8.24%. The discount rate on three-month Treasurybills fell to 7.53% from 7.59% Wednesday.   William Sullivan, director of money market research atDean Witter, said the flight-to-quality buying was firstevident in Tokyo, where investors bailed out of the Japanesestock market as the Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocksplunged 1473.28 points to 23,737.63. That was thefourth-largest single-day decline in that market.   In the broader bond market, prices were knocked sharplylower. Once again, the market's nemesis was rising oilprices, which investors fear will lead to spiraling inflationand interest rates. Fixed-income investors dislike inflationbecause it cuts the value of their portfolios by reducing theinflation-adjusted return.   After hitting a five-year high Wednesday, October oilfutures ended at $31.93 a barrel yesterday, up 71 cents.   Douglas Schindewolf, vice president and money marketeconomist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., said investorsare paralyzed by the fear of inflation and &quot;uncertainty abouthow high oil could go in the event of an actual armedconflict.&quot;   Many analysts expect further declines in governmentsecurities, accompanied by higher yields, as long as thefocus remains on oil prices and the Persian Gulf, and not oneconomic fundamentals.   &quot;Forecasting rates is hazardous business with the eventsin the Middle East so unpredictable, but I think rates willgrid a bit higher,&quot; said James Fralick, an economist atMorgan Stanley andamp; Co.   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said foreign embassiesin Kuwait must be closed by today, and threatened thatembassy personnel remaining in the oil-rich Arab kingdomcould be stripped of their diplomatic status if they remain.   President Bush, along with other Western leaders, has saidhe will not abide by Mr. Hussein's deadline and will keep theU.S. Embassy open.   &quot;Tomorrow's deadline could be the triggerpoint,&quot; for thefirst clash between U.S. and Iraqi forces, said Mr.Schindewolf.   Elsewhere, the Commerce Department today will releaserevisions to second-quarter gross national product data.Economists believe the figure will be revised upward to aninflation-adjusted annual rate of 1.5% from 1.2%, accordingto a Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.                                                                                                          Foreign Bonds                                                                                                          British government bonds continued to recuperate from asevere oil-related beating while prices in West Germany weremodestly lower.   But in Japan, which imports all of its oil, the bondmarket rout continued. Traders said higher oil prices and adisappointing government bond auction pushed yields onJapan's benchmark 10-year bond to the highest levels innearly a decade.   In Tokyo trading, the yield on the benchmark No. 11910-year bond ended at 8.31% as the issue's price fell to82.21, down 0.82 points. The yield on nearest bond futurescontract ended at 88.45, down 1.03 points, to yield 8.089%.That was the highest yield ever for a bond futures contract.(When calculated using the semiannual compound measure, theyield on the No. 119 bond ended at 7.60%, according toSalomon Brothers Inc.)   As prices sank, the Japanese Finance Ministry attempted tosupport the bond market by purchasing 90 billion yen of10-year bonds. But the purchase had almost no influence onthe market.   With yields for existing bonds above 8%, traders saidinvestors weren't interested in buying new 10-year securitiesat yesterday's government auction because the 7.53% yield onthe securities, which was set by the government, wasconsidered unattractive. The offer totaled 800 billion yen.   Meanwhile, Japan's long-term prime rate is expected tojump to 8.5% from 7.9% currently because the sell-off in theJapanese bond market has sharply boosted the costs of fundsfor banks.   Japan's three long-term credit banks, which reset thelong-term prime rate at the end of each month, are expectedto make the decision to boost the long-term prime rate today.The three banks are Industrial Bank of Japan, Long-TermCredit Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Long-term Treasury bonds were hit hard again, but someshort-term bills and notes ended unchanged or higher.   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of96 1/32 to yield 9.13%, compared with 96 26/32 to yield 9.05%on Wednesday. The latest 10-year note ended at 98 8/32 toyield 9% compared with 98 22/32 to yield 8.93%. Two year-notewere unchanged at 99 17/32 to yield 8.24%.   The Treasury yesterday sold $10.52 billion of 52-weekTreasury bills at an average rate of 7.40%.   Next week, the Treasury will sell $11.5 billion of newtwo-year notes and $8.5 billion of new five-year notes. Inwhen-issued trading activity yesterday, the two-year noteswere quoted at yields of 8.24% while the five-year notes werequoted at yields of 8.67%.   Here are details of yesterday's 52-week Treasury billauction:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it. Thepercentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while thecoupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                                                                                                                                   52-Week Bills                                                                                                          Applications .......................... $24,477,190,000   Accepted bids ......................... $10,519,670,000   Accepted at low price .................             48%   Accepted noncompetitively .............    $611,430,000   Average price (Rate) ..................  92.518 (7.40%)   High price (Rate) .....................  92.528 (7.39%)   Low price (Rate) ......................  92.498 (7.42%)   Coupon equivalent .....................           7.95%                                                                                                          The bills are dated Aug. 30, and mature Aug. 29, 1991.                                                                                                          Junk, Corporate Issues                                                                                                          The junk-bond market added to its heavy losses as plungingstock prices pulled bond prices sharply lower.   Junk bonds plummeted at the opening but managed to stage apartial rebound at midday after the stock market stabilized.But when stocks resumed their sharp slide later, junk bondsfollowed suit.   Most higher-quality junk bonds ended one point lower, butmid-to-lower quality issues suffered even greater losses.   One of the biggest losers was RJR Nabisco Inc. Its 17.375%convertible pay-in-kind debentures fell 2 1/8 points to 1061/4 while its 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures ended 33/4 points lower at 80 3/4.   Elsewhere, Fort Howard Corp.'s 14.125% junior debenturesfell two points to 40, Gaylord Container Corp.'s 13.75%subordinated debentures dropped three points to an offeredprice of 62, and National Gypsum's 14.50% senior subordinateddebentures shed two points to 40.   The market's better-quality recession-resistant issues,such as Duracell Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co., remainedfirm.   In the investment-grade market, $600 million in newcorporate debt was priced including a $250 million issue offive-year issue of Federal Farm Credit Banks notes.   Strong demand prompted underwriters at Merrill LynchCapital Markets to increase the size of the issue twice afterpricing. The notes, which are non-callable for two years,were priced to yield 8.94%.   In the secondary market, high-grade bonds also postedlosses, ending the day about 1/2 point lower.                                                                                                          Municipal Issues                                                                                                          Municipal bonds were 3/8 to one point lower.   In new-issue dealings, seven firms won $550 million ofTexas tax and revenue anticipation notes. The bulk of thenotes were purchased by a Merrill Lynch Capital Marketsgroup, which priced them with a 6 1/2% coupon to yield 6.18%.   Among dollar bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20%issue due in 2018 was 3/4 point lower at 95 3/4 to yield7.52%.                                                                                                          Mortgage-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage-securities prices fell again.   Government National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2%pass-through securities for September delivery lost 3/8 pointto 97 5/8, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 9 1/2% issuefell 10/32 to 97 9/32 and Federal National MortgageAssociation's 9 1/2% securities were 10/32 lower at 97 26/32.   The Department of Veterans Affairs offered $293 million ofmortgage pass-through certificates backed by vendee loans,which are loans issued to finance the sale of VA-ownedproperties acquired as a result of loan defaults.   ---   Christopher B.
