The decision by the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appealscould provide the opportunity for the Supreme Court to reviewthe constitutional basis for its decision in Roe v. Wade in1973, which recognized women's constitutional right toabortion, said Linda Wharton, managing attorney for theWomen's Law Project, in Philadelphia.</LP><TEXT>   The provision being appealed was the only significantportion of Pennsylvania's new law restricting abortions thatwas rejected Monday by the appeals court in Philadelphia. Therest of the decision upheld requirements that women under 18years old must have parental consent before obtainingabortions, and that all women seeking abortions must delaythe procedure for 24 hours and first listen to astate-prepared talk on the risks and benefits of abortion andchildbirth.   All of the provisions were enacted after a July 1989Supreme Court decision in Webster vs. Reproductive HealthServices upheld a number of Missouri state law prohibitionson abortion and seemed to invite increased state involvementin the issue.   Pennsylvania Attorney General Ernest D. Preate saidyesterday that the directive in Webster was broad enough topermit Pennsylvania's provision requiring married women toinform their husbands prior to obtaining an abortion. &quot;Ourargument all along has been that all of the controls in thestatutes are reasonable under existing law,&quot; Mr. Preate saidin a statement.   Acting on behalf of all abortion providers in the state,Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania and fiveabortion clinics challenged the state law as soon as it wasenacted in November 1989, and obtained an injunction barringit from taking effect pending the outcome of the suit.   Lawyers for the plaintiffs said yesterday that theinjunction will remain in place for the next three weeks,while the clinics decide whether or not to file their ownappeal to the Supreme Court. No decision on whether to appealis expected for several days, said Ms. Wharton of the Women'sLaw Project, one of the plaintiffs.   ---   ALLIED AND FEDERATED win battle over retiree benefits.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug, Jr., of Cinncinati,ruled Monday that Federated Department Stores Inc. and AlliedStores Corp. do not have to guarantee continued medicalbenefits to retirees in order to emerge from bankruptcy-courtprotection. The companies' dispute with retirees hadthreatened to derail their plans to emerge from bankruptcycourt proceedings on Feb. 3, which Judge Aug informallyapproved yesterday.   Glen Nager, an attorney for Federated and Allied, saidJudge Aug's ruling is the first ever to address the issue ofwhether a debtor must pay benefits to retirees until theirdeaths. Other bankruptcy cases, Mr. Nager said, have dealtwith a related issue -- whether a debtor can modify benefitpayments during the period when the reorganization is beingnegotiated.   Federated and Allied filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-lawprotection in January 1990. In July the companies filed arevised plan of reorganization that would wipe out about $2.3billion in creditor claims and create a new FederatedDepartment Stores Inc., an independent, publicly held companywithout any ties to its current owner, Campeau Corp. ofToronto.   Talks between the debtors and the retirees' committee overthe proposed modification of benefits broke down in October.As a result, Judge Aug agreed to rule on the debtors' claimthat federal bankruptcy law does not require the companies toguarantee payments or pay at levels agreed to before thebankruptcy-court filings.   The retirees argued that their rights to medical benefitswere vested, guaranteeing them payments for the rest of theirlives.   Judge Aug ruled that interpreting the Bankruptcy Code togive the retirees a vested right would provide them with &quot;awindfall&quot; and &quot;put them well ahead of&quot; employees who have notyet retired. He said that his ruling leaves the retirees with&quot;their old contract rights or an unsecured claim&quot; and theycan make proposals for payments at hearings to approve thereorganization plan, or before.   Thomas Jones, the retirees' attorney, said the judgeincorrectly interpreted the law, but that he was pleased thatthe judge recognized that the retirees have a right to pursuetheir claims.   Mr. Nager, however, said that based on his reading ofJudge Aug's opinion, the companies are not obligated to payretiree benefits, even though they are still negotiating withthe retirees. Prior to the bankruptcy-court filings, themedical benefit plans were guaranteed by contracts that werereviewed annually, Mr. Nager said.   Court hearings to review a previously filed disclosurestatement on the proposed reorganization plan are expected toresume Oct. 28. If the disclosure statement is then approved,creditors will begin voting on a plan of reorganization Nov.5. The deadline for voting is Dec. 20, with confirmationhearings scheduled for Jan. 9 and 10, 1992.   &quot;Everybody is pleased that a consensual agreement appearsto have been reached,&quot; said Lewis S. Rosenbloom, a partner inthe Chicago law firm Winston andamp; Strawn, and lead counsel tothe Federated unsecured creditors committee. &quot;There's still alengthy confirmation process ahead, and we have yet to seeall the definitive documentation. Barring surprises, weexpect the new Federated to emerge at the beginning ofFebruary.&quot;   ---   BRITISH GOVERNMENT MUST turn over internal memoranda, U.S.judge rules.   The documents, involving the government's decision toinvest in the failed Belfast, Northern Ireland, auto works ofJohn Z. DeLorean, must be turned over to Arthur Andersen andamp;Co., which was DeLorean Motor Co.'s accounting firm. TheBritish government has accused Arthur Andersen of fraud andviolations of the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt OrganizationsAct in a suit in federal court in New York.   Under RICO, if the British government wins thesix-year-old suit it will be due three times the amount ofmoney it invested with DeLorean, approximately $500 million.   The British government had refused to release thematerials, which include documents produced at the cabinetlevel, claiming executive privilege. But U.S. District CourtJudge Charles E. Stewart in Manhattan ruled that since theBritish government had filed its suit in a U.S. court, it hadto turn over documents relevant to the defendant.   It is rare for a foreign government to be required to makeavailable material over which it claims executive privilege.This case is believed to mark the first time that the Britishgovernment has been required to turn over cabinet documentsto a U.S. court. The material won't be made public becausemany of the documents will be sealed.   The documents concern the decisions between 1978 and 1982by the predecessor offices to the Department of EconomicDevelopment, which reports to Britain's Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland, to invest #80 million, or about $160million, in Mr. DeLorean's sports car company. In its suit,the British government maintains that it would not have madethe investment had it been given a clear picture of thefinancial condition of DeLorean Motor.   Arthur Andersen has denied preparing fraudulent reportsfor DeLorean Motor. Attorneys for Arthur Andersen said theyneeded the documents to defend the firm against the suit.   &quot;The cabinet relied on political considerations to makethese investments, not Arthur Andersen,&quot; said James D. Zirin,an attorney at Breed, Abbott andamp; Morgan, which is representingthe accounting firm.   Hans Smit, a professor at the Columbia University Schoolof Law, said it was &quot;ironic&quot; that the British governmentwould be suing under RICO because it has passed a law tolimit the impact of its powerful treble damage provision onBritish companies.   ---   DREXEL'S SUIT against Milken must be ready for trial April1, judge orders.   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. sued its formerjunk-bond chief, Michael Milken, in September, blaming thefirm's near demise on his alleged wrongdoing. The suitaccuses Mr. Milken of breach of fiduciary duty, racketeering,and theft of corporate opportunity, among other things.Lowell Milken, who worked for his brother in the junk-bonddepartment, also is a defendant in the suit.   Judge Milton Pollack of federal court in Manhattan ruledthat the company and Mr. Milken must be ready for trial April1. He also gave Mr. Milken until Nov. 12 to make anycounterclaims against Drexel, which filed forbankruptcy-court protection in February 1990. In the suit,Drexel is being represented by Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore, thelaw firm that also is representing thrift regulators in theirsuits against Mr. Milken.   Mr. Milken, who pleaded guilty to six securities-relatedfelonies last year, began serving his 10-year prison sentencein March.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          A BANKRUPTCY JUDGE ruled last week that FederatedDepartment Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. did not haveto guarantee continued medical benefits to retirees in orderto emerge from bankruptcy-court protection. He also ruledthat retirees would retain any contractual rights even if thebankruptcy case were dropped or dismissed. The latter pointwas misstated in last Wednesday's edition.
