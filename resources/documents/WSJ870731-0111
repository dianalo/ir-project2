In a highly controversial provision, it would give some doctors new authority to notify victims' sexual partners.    &quot;We cannot afford for anyone to be afraid to seek medical advice on AIDS. But if Americans believe they will be treated as citizens with rights, they will respond as citizens with responsibilities,&quot; said the author, Rep. Henry Waxman, (D., Calif.) in introducing the Federal AIDS Policy Act.    Lawmakers said the legislation, which authorizes as much as $400 million for AIDS testing and counseling in each of the next three fiscal years, incorporates the recommendations of nearly every leading public health group, as well as the Reagan administration's chief public health officer, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.    The measure would authorize grants to existing health care facilities that serve high-risk groups, provided these facilities agree to provide counseling both before and after testing. The counseling would have to include information on transmission of the disease, the meaning of test results, and confidentiality.    Recipients of federal funds would also have to agree to offer anonymous counseling and testing, unless prohibited by state law. The measure would allow new civil penalties and other sanctions to be brought against fund recipients that violate the confidentiality provisions.    And it would more broadly prohibit discrimination against otherwise qualified people in housing, employment, public accommodations or government services on the basis of a positive diagnosis for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.    In the most controversial move, which is provoking concern from civil liberties and gay rights groups, the measure provides exceptions to the confidentiality rule for federally funded health facilities, including allowing doctors to notify a spouse or known sexual partners if a patient refuses to do so. It would also allow reporting to state health officers, if required by state law.    Several civil and gay rights advocates said they fear the exceptions could negate the positive aspects of the bill by discouraging people from coming forward.    &quot;Most people will not harm their sexual partners, the people they love most,&quot; said Paul Albert, director of the San Francisco National Laywers' Guild/AIDS Network. &quot;You would have a very tiny number of people to whom the law is going to apply, but the very threat of it is going to keep people from counseling.&quot;    In backing the new legislation, Rep. Waxman, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, was joined by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), chairman of the Senate's Labor and Human Resources Committee, and several dozen lawmakers from both parties. The lead GOP co-sponsor, Rep. James Jeffords (R., Vt.), called his participation a tribute to the late Rep. Stewart McKinney, a Connecticut Republican who earlier this year became the first sitting member of Congress to die of AIDS. </TEXT></DOC>
