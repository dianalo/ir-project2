Doyle Computing Consultants of Salem, Mass., aconsulting company specializing in executive information systems.andO;&quot;Generating fatal error No.andP;  37 will just turn them off, and they'll never goback.&quot;andM;Doyle cited an example in which a Fortune 500 vice president had to ask hissecretary for a weekly report.andP;  She had to call the mainframe with a modem,issue the SQL query, put the information into Lotus 1-2-3, and create agraph.andP;  It took two hours and he felt guilty every time he asked.andP;  Now he hasa Mac, a CL/1 link to the mainframe, and a HyperCard program Doyle createdthat has two buttons: Get Info and Create Graph.andM;Other routes to SQL.andP;  Just as users balk at writing their own SQL queries,they will not want to write their own CL/1 programs.andP;  &quot;I can't sit down andwrite a syntactically correct SQL statement every time, and I use to teach itat IBM,&quot; Hoffman said.andM;A new category of software has added user-friendly, ad hoc query front endsto SQL.andP;  ClearAccess (CL/A) is a desk accessory that reads the structure ofSQL databases and allows users to build queries by clicking on table andfield names and choosing conditions.andP;  CL/A builds the SQL statements.andM;Graphical Query Language (GQL) is a stand-alone application that lets youbuild queries from a pictorial view of the database and its relational links.andO;For some, the graphical representation is easier to work with.andM;At Washington Water Power Co. of Spokane, Wash., Mac users have their choiceof access routes to the IBM DB2 database.andP;  Rather than imposing a singlesolution, Rick Stehno, applications support analyst at Washington WaterPower, is widening his user community by offering a diverse set of accesstools to the corporate database.andM;&quot;If users just want access, they can use CL/A or GQL for ad hoc queries,&quot;Stehno said.andP;  &quot;If they want a database system, we can use Omnis or 4thDimension, and for transaction systems, we can add a HyperCard front end.&quot;andM;CL/A and GQL specifically allow &quot;What if?&quot; modeling of data that before hadbeen inaccessible to the executives that could best use it.andM;At the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, researchers hadthe opposite problem: too many users creating their own databases.andP;  A groupof scientists working on the Human Genome Project were collecting informationin their own HyperCard databases.andP;  &quot;It's exciting, and a little scary, to seethe ease with which new computer users can create their owninformation-management environments,&quot; said Mark Frisse, assistant professorof medicine, medical informatics and computer science at WashingtonUniversity.andP;  It was dangerous to have data being updated in different stacks,Frisse added.andM;Frisse has designed a prototype system with a HyperCard scratch pad frontingfor a central database in Sybase on a CL/1-equipped VAX.andP;  It looks the sameto the scientists, but now they are generating SQL commands from HyperCardinstead of manipulating stacks.andP;  &quot;The object was not to impose a new paradigmbut to support the existing one,&quot; Frisse said.andM;Future connections.andP;  Apple is looking to pick up more third-party vendorsupport for CL/1, but, more importantly, the company is building CL/1 intoSystem 7.0 as the Data Access Manager.andP;  Developers will use it, while userswill reap the benefits without ever realizing it's there.andP;  If Apple's promiseis fulfilled, all Macintosh applications will be able to issue SQL commands.andM;There are also proprietary multiplatform solutions from Oracle Corp., SybaseInc., Informix Software Inc. and TechGnosis Inc.andP;  Each supports severalMacintosh programs and SQL platforms and promises more before System 7.0 isavailable.andP;  And each supports CL/1 but also can be used as an alternative toit.andP;  This is especially important where CL/1 can't be used yet, as with Unixsystems and IBM PCs and compatibles.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
