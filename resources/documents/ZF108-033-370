it runs in protected mode in thememory above 1Mb, leaving most of the 640Kb space for network drivers,memory-resident programs such as Sidekick, and other utilities; the thinglists for a hefty $3,300, but registered users of AutoCAD Release 10 can haveit for $300.andM;- o -andM;Silicon wafer producer Osaka Titanium Co Ltd plans major increases incapacity at its semiconductor material plants in both Japan and the US: it isstarting construction of new facilities at its Imari, Kyushu plant toincrease silicon polished wafer capacity for 4M-bit and 16M-bit memory chipmakers, investing $85m and planning to start production in 9spring 1991; inthe US, it says it plans a new silicon polished wafer facility at itsCincinnati Semiconductor Inc unit.andM;- o -andM;London W1-based Data Networks Plc has beaten off the competition to renew itscontract with London Underground Ltd to supply mainframe computer servicesfor payroll and other administrative functions: worth #3m, the deal wassecured only after the contract had been submitted to competitive tendering,thought necessary by London Underground despite the fact that it says it was&quot;highly satisfied&quot; with Data Networks the first time round.andM;- o -andM;Information Management Technologies Corp, New York has acquired the rights tothe Coins Computer Output Information System optical disk subsystem fromAcctex Information Systems Inc in exchange for shares in InformationManagement Technologies: the new business will be named Imtech OpticalSystems Inc.andM;- o -andM;MCI Communications Corp and Telefonos de Mexico SA de CV have signed toprovide direct voice and other telecommunications services between the US andMexico starting this week: new fibre optic border crossings directlyconnecting the networks will be laid this year.andM;- o -andM;three-year, $25m from Data Communications Corp of Korea to build a publicpacket-switched data network for South Korea: the new Dacom Network Servicesalready has customers in waiting, including the Korean steel industry, whichwill use it to track inventories, process orders and communicate withsuppliers, and the Korean Postal Service, which plans to offer an on-linepostal banking service, with terminals in 500 post offices throughout thecountry;
