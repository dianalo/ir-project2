Glynn's letter on the page opposite today gives an idea of what the FCC is up against in trying to partly deregulate ATandamp;T's long-distance telephone service (see: &quot;Letters to the Editor: Phone Profit Doesn't Ring True&quot; -- WSJ August 21, 1987). You just can't please some people.    Mr. Glynn, in citing profit statistics, neglects to mention another interesting number in the Journal story he challenges. After Maryland dropped rate-of-return regulation a year ago, the cost of a five-minute daytime phone call within 100 miles dropped 27%. This is consumer victimization?    Now we don't mean to pick on Mr. Glynn. &quot;People's counsels&quot; no doubt have a duty to rail at big monopolies. And certainly he has plenty of company. When the FCC put out its deregulatory proposal for public comment early this month, the Consumer Federation of America, the American Association of Retired Persons and a host of other &quot;consumer&quot; organizations began sharpening their knives for the agency's energetic new chairman, 36-year-old Dennis Patrick. There are mutterings as well against Mr. Patrick from a couple of red tape spinners in Congress, Ed Markey (D., Mass.) and John Dingell (D., Mich.).    Yet surely there is something a wee bit illogical if a federal policy is described as anti-consumer when the very same idea, applied at the state level, has cut prices 27%. Maryland is not alone, as an earlier piece by the Journal's Janet Guyon pointed out. In 10 of 12 states where profit regulation has been removed, intrastate long-distance rates have fallen an average of 10%, according to ATandamp;T.    This should surprise no one. For years, federal and state regulatory agencies demonstrated over and over again that rate-of-return regulation does not, in and of itself, hold down prices. To the contrary, it tends to raise them, for much the same reasons that letting a cost-plus contract is a good way to get stung.    The reason is quite simple. A company subject to rate-of-return regulation earns more dollars if its costs go up than if they go down. Of course, it may ultimately lose most of its business and have no profits at all, as the railroads learned after submitting to the benign guidance of the Interstate Commerce Commission for a century.    Mr. Patrick and anyone else giving the matter serious thought knows that regulatory bodies can't manage enterprises, hard as they try. Even the appointed managers of unregulated companies in competitive industries have a hard time controlling costs. And they don't have a perverse incentive to do the opposite.    So what the FCC has in fact proposed is to continue capping the prices of ATandamp;T's long-distance service but to adjust the caps according to a formula that takes changing conditions into account. Both the company and the consumer would get a share of any productivity gains the company is able to make.    Now it is by no means clear that the FCC can design caps that are truly deregulatory. If it does, the productivity gains could be substantial, with yields for both the company and consumers. That raises some fears that MCI and U.S. Sprint, ATandamp;T's two competitors in the long-distance business, won't be able to compete.    But interestingly enough, MCI and U.S. Sprint, although they have had their own profitability problems lately, aren't objecting to the FCC change. They are not exactly patsies. MCI has backing from IBM, which owns 17% of its stock. U.S. Sprint is a joint venture of United Telecommunications Inc. and GTE Corp., two other large factors in the communications business. And the nation's consumerists surely aren't prepared to argue that consumers should continue to pay higher-than-necessary phone rates just to keep MCI and U.S. Sprint in business.    The consumerists have some other problems as well. It's a bit hard to paint ATandamp;T as an ogre when so many Americans own Ma Bell stock, either directly or beneficially through pension plans. If it's government monopoly the consumerists want, they need only be reminded that other governments around the world are happily going the opposite way, shedding big, inefficient telecommunications bureaucracies by privatizing them.    Finally, it's always good to keep in mind that the folks who run consumerist organizations have a conflict with the very people they say they represent. If deregulation continues to grow in popularity with consumers, simple market competition will substitute for regulatory hearings. And when those hearing rooms are closed, consumerists will have to find other work. No wonder they're not happy with the the FCC's latest proposal. </TEXT></DOC>
