While he didn't flatly rule out stepping in to end the walkout,Bush said his policy ``will hold firm'' despite pressure in somecongressional quarters to force him to act.   The president had spare time in his schedule Tuesday becauseinclement weather forced him to cancel a planned trip to Lancaster,Pa., and Wilmington, Del., for speeches on his plans to attack drugabuse.   As he stepped to the White House podium, Bush's transportationsecretary, Samuel Skinner, was on Capitol Hill urging lawmakers notto pass legislation that would force Bush's hand on the Easternstrike. Under a provision of the Railway Labor Act, he could stopthe walkout for 60 days while a presidentially-appointed panelinvestigated the dispute.   House Speaker Jim Wright responded that Bush's refusal to haltthe strike by appointing an investigative panel ``would beunprecedented,'' noting that over the last half-century 33 suchboards have been named in transportation disputes.   Bush, however, used his opening news conference statement to``restate my belief that free collective bargaining is the bestmeans of resolving'' the strike.   He exhorted Eastern management, the Machinists union and otherunions to conduct ``head-on-head, man-to-man negotiation'' and saidhe thought that would be ``better and more lasting ... than animposed government settlement, which could cause the airline tototally shut down.''   Bush urged pilots threatening a sympathy slowdown in support ofthe strike not to ``make the innocent traveling public a pawn inthis dispute.'' He reiterated that if the machinists try to shutdown rail service he will ask Congress to ban such secondaryboycotts.   ``It is not fair to say to a commuter on a train coming in fromLong Island that you're going to be caught up and victimized by astrike affecting an airline,'' he said. ``Simply isn't fair.''</TEXT></DOC>
