 Itrepresents the company's open strategy for systems and services throughoutthe 1990s, and he claims that it is based on current and de facto industrystandards, so it does not restrict users to a single vendor-imposedarchitecture.andP;  Consequently, McNeil says that Bull is now co-operating withformer competitors, and the Model is being demonstrated at the Hannover Fairwhere Bull's so-called technology partners such as Microsoft, Oracle,Informix Software and Ingres are endorsing the thing.andM;Gnaw awayandM;However, since Bull's own kit seems almost incidental to the Model, someobservers are questioning whether it is the road to Enterprise Computing, orwhether the company is all but abdicating its role as a manufacturer andassuming the systems integration mantle in its entirety.andP;  In many ways, Bullis making a courageous stand, and if the strategy works, it will be able tognaw away and erode proprietary markets.andP;  It is planning to invest a further$2,000m on Model-based technology by 1994, and some of the past two years'research and development is bearing fruit with LAN Manager for OS/2 and Unix,transparent database access, distributed on-line processing and imagingservices.andP;  The company claims that it has had to wait for key standards tobecome generally accepted, the most important being the Open SoftwareFoundation Distributed Computing Environment, which Bull says is set to bethe Open Distributed Computing technology of the early 1990s.andP;  But, as withIBM's SystemView, just how this sweeping integration is to be achievedremains mysterious.andP;  Groupe Bull has etched a broad landscape, but it hasstill to paint in the shadows.andP;  The Distributed Computing Model is dividedinto six components: Application; Application Services; Communication andSystem Services; Integrated Systems Management and Security; and ApplicationDevelopment.andP;  The Application module contains industry-specific end-userapplications provided by Bull, other software vendors or the customer.andP;  Theycall underlying services and interact with the end-user through thePresentation Service.andP;  Bull claims that separating applications fromunderlying services simplifies the integration of new systems into theexisting infrastructure.andP;  The second module, Application Services, consistsof features that handle displaying, printing, sharing or processinginformation.andP;  They are grouped into classes - end-user, exchange or live data- but the company says users need not know where the services are actuallyperformed since the software elements are shared by all systems and notreplicated in the applications.andP;  The Distributed Services component is toprovide transparent distribution of functions across the network, regardlessof the types that make up the network.andP;  -andM;By Janice McGinnandM;Distribution includes distributed file services, interoperability andsecurity, naming, remote procedural calls, network independence and support,time service for fault-tolerance and system management.andP;  The Communicationsand System Services module transports information and uses a range ofprotocols including OSI, TCP and SNA.andP;  Systems Services provide the basicfunctions required by applications and other services to interact.andP;  Theseinclude operating system functions to allocate memory and to create andmanage processes.andP;  The Integrated Systems Management and Security moduleprovides security and management throughout the network.andP;  Bull says thatstandards-based technologies are applied in management applications, commonmanagement services and managed objects.andP;  The security framework adheres todraft standards being defined by the US Department of Defense and theEuropean Community.andP;  The last module, Application Development, provides anenvironment for development and maintenance cycles.andP;  It includes programminglanguages and development tools; access to other components via applicationprogramming interfaces; a computer aided software engineering environmentusing a common repository; and an integrated project support environment.andO;Open Software Foundation technology is claimed to be at the core of themodel, with the Open Sotware Foundation/Distributed Computing Environmentproviding building blocks for systems developed under the model.andP;  Bull plansto implement its Model-based strategy in three phases.andP;  Key products withinthe 1991-1992 timeframe are the OpenTeam Workgroup and Affinity.andP;  The firstis based on LAN Manager and it enables personal computer users - runningMS-DOS or OS/2 - Macintoshes, workstations and minis to access applicationsresiding on mainframes, mid-range machines or within a workgroup, and it hasa common windows interface.andP;  Affinity provides a link between personalcomputers and Bull's GCOS operating systems, so that users can process GCOSapplications such as Magna, Focus and Interel under MS-DOS.andP;  In addition,Bull says it is developing its Open Alliance Strategy for enhancing thecapabilities of GCOS mainframes, mid-range and minicomputers with Unix andpersonal computer applications, based on TCP/IP networking protocols.andO;1992-1993 will see new capabilities on distributed and interoperable Unixsystems working together over TCP/IP local area networks, and Bull says therewill be a gradual evolution towards OSI local and wide area networks.andO;BeleagueredApplications on personal computers and Unix-based systems will beable to access distributed files, printing and file transfer.andP;  System andnetwork management applications will facilitate administration of distributedsystems, and the first applications will be for installation, networkmanagement and software distribution.andP;  Bull says it will work with softwarepartners to expand the appli-cation catalogue, which will be built onobject-oriented and expert system technologies.andP;  From 1993, Bull intends toenhance interoperability between GCOS machines, Unix-based systems and userworkstations.andP;  In conjunction with the Model, it will offer a range ofservices that users can exploit at the desktop.andP;  These will include networkservices, requirement analysis, modelling, capacity analysis and performanceoptimisation.andP;  It's an impressive array of technology and McNeil reckons thatthe strategy will make Bull a leader, with others following its initiatives.andO;However, the goals are highly ambitious and whether France's beleaguerednational computer company is capable of transforming a manifesto for federalcomputing into practice is something that many observers doubt.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
