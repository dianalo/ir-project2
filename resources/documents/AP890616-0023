(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A two-state coal miners' wildcat strikeescalated Thursday with roving pickets expanding their walkout tothe northern West Virginia coal field, company officials said.   ``I think what we're seeing is it's pretty much spreading,'' saidIsland Creek Coal Co. spokesman Noel Jones.   Island Creek's southern West Virginia mines, employing about 190,have been shut down since Monday as striking workers ignore afederal judge's back-to-work order.   On Thursday, the walkout spread to Island Creek's Grant Countymines, employing 625, and its Nicholas County mines, where 250miners work, Jones said.   All BethEnergy Mines Inc. West Virginia mines were shut down,idling about 600 workers in Boone, Nicholas and Barbour counties,said company president R.J. Fisher.   Estimates of the number of miners idled by the wildcat range upto 10,000.   The walkout began Monday as a show of solidarity with 1,600United Mine Workers members in West Virginia and Virginia on strikesince April against The Pittston Coal Group.   UMW members at Pittston had been working for 14 months without acontract. In particular, workers are angry that the company droppedout of the union's national contract with the Bituminous CoalOperators Association in an attempt to wring favorable work-rulechanges.   Union officials have not returned phone calls this week, but theyhave said they did not authorize the walkouts, which violate ano-strike clause in the union's 1988 national contract with the BCOA.   BCOA Chairman Robert Quenon on Thursday called on UMW leadershipto end the walkout, saying any hopes the strike will make othercompanies pressure Pittston to settle on a contract are misguided.   ``I would no more try to tell someone else how to run theircompany than I would expect someone else to try to tell me how torun my company,'' said Quenon, president of Peabody Holding Co., thenation's largest coal producer.   In Washington, U.S. Rep. Nick Joe Rahall, D-W.Va., called forPittston and New Beckley Mining Co., also the object of a UMWcontract strike, to settle with the union.   ``These companies are doing a grave disservice to those coaloperators who negotiated in good faith and signed agreements withthe UMWA,'' Rahall said.   ``By refusing to come to terms with their workers, thesecompanies are creating an atmosphere in the coal fields which is notconducive to the type of stability and security of supply thepurchasers of our coal have come to expect.''   Rahall also offered encouragement to three top union officialswho have been jailed without bond in Roanoke, Va., for orchestratingpicket-line civil disobedience in the Pittston strike.   ``And to those who have been jailed for no act of violence, butfor exercising your constitutional rights, I say do not despair,''Rahall said.   The strike also spread Thursday to barge-loading operations alongthe Kanawha River in the Charleston area. Several operators alongthe river reported that pickets manned entrances to theirfacilities. Some continued to move coal while others could not.   UMW pickets appeared briefly at Amherst Industries Inc. nearCharleston, where 17 United Steelworkers members failed to report towork, a spokesman said. About 18 pickets in front of Hatfield Dockand Transfer Inc. in Marmet kept a half-dozen employees from goingto work, one employee said.   Madison Coal and Supply Inc. tied up three tugboats Thursday,idling 31 employees, said Bill Barr, manager of marine traffic. Hesaid he expects more layoffs if the wildcats continue.   ``This is going to put the whole state into an economic crisis,''Barr said.   The walkout hasn't hurt West Virginia's economy yet, but the painthreshhold could be near for some areas, state Energy Departmentspokeswoman Twila Matheny said.   ``When you're talking about your heavier coal producing counties,and 90 percent of their mines closed, we could be near that now,''she said.   Lawyers for seven coal companies filed damage lawsuits in federalcourt Wednesday naming the UMW and several locals in southern WestVirginia as defendants.   Several companies said they are suffering daily losses of as muchas $97,000 because of the strike.   There is ``a 100 percent chance'' of a sympathy strike inAlabama, said United Mine Workers international executive boardmember Tommy Buchanan, whose District 20 includes most of the state.   Buchanan, however, said but UMW President Richard Trumka wouldmake the final decision on any walkout. There are an estimated 6,500miners in the state, most of them union members.</TEXT></DOC>
