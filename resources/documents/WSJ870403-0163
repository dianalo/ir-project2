Bruce Johnsen's assurance (letter, March 6) that insider trading is not unethical because information gets more quickly impounded in market prices. Suppose my firm is about to begin buying shares of another as part of a takeover plan. An insider/arbitrager combine begins buying those shares heavily ahead of my firm. The price immediately reflects the new information, and we have to pay more. Our proprietary information has been stolen and given to the market.    The insiders/arbitragers are a band of Merry Men, robbing the (information) rich to give to the (information) poor. The value stolen must equal the value given plus the value kept by Robin Hood for food, arrows and the required return on capital. On balance society is no worse off in a short-run accounting sense. However, the ethical issue is profound.    As to why corporations do not proscribe insider trading: Adam Smith might argue the sensible economics of hiring a specialized police force (the SEC) to guard the property rather than having firms play detective.    Prof. James V. Jordan   Va. Polytechnic Institute   Falls Church, Va.   ---   Prof. Johnsen may get a passing grade for entrepreneurial opportunism, but he falls well short of the mark in business ethics and corporate responsibility.    Even the prospect of a perfectly efficient market is no justification for insider trading, and it is ingenuous at best to suggest that small investors will receive more for their shares than they would have in the absence of insider activity. That would certainly not be the case if the insiders were selling on their privately gained knowledge. And where is it written that competition is always or even often an incentive for corporations to act more ethically? A strong argument can be made to show precisely the opposite.    The heart of the ethical issue is not, as Prof. Johnsen suggests, &quot;freedom of contract&quot; in some idealized, 19th-century sense but rather fairness and trust and, yes, even utility. Insider trading simply is not fair when the ground rules of the markets presume equal access to knowledge. But, most important of all, the strength and viability of the markets are based on the trust of small investors that they are not going to be &quot;taken.&quot;    D.
