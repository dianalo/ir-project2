The action surprised some committee members, who hadearlier predicted that the bill would receive a favorablerecommendation.</LP><TEXT>   The committee was deadlocked 18-18 in an initial vote tosend the amendment to the floor with a negativerecommendation. A second vote, which would have approved theamendment, failed 19-17 before the committee approved amotion by Chairman Jack Brooks (D., Texas) to report the billwithout recommendation. The Brooks motion passed 19-17.   The House action comes in the wake of the Supreme Court'sJune 11 decision striking down the federal flag-protectionlaw. Co-sponsored by House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R.,Ill.) and Rep. Sonny Montgomery (D., Miss.), the amendmentsays, &quot;The Congress and the States shall have power toprohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the UnitedStates.&quot;   To become part of the Constitution, the proposed amendmentneeds a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress plusapproval by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states.   House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said &quot;it will be avery close vote.&quot; Opponents assert that they are withinstriking distance of the 146 votes necessary to block theamendment. Rep. Robert Kastenmeier (D., Wis.), an opponent,said his side has picked up 10 or 12 votes in the past week.   The Senate has scheduled a hearing on the amendment fortomorrow. Sen. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.) said there were 54Senate votes for the amendment, 24 against and 22 undecided,with most of the undecideds ready to vote against it.   Democrats on the House committee were eager to bring thebill to a vote as early as tomorrow. Republicans, sensingthat more time to publicize the issue would create problemsfor the Democrats, would like to see a vote next week.   Much of the debate revolved around enforcement and focusedon a preamble elaborating on the amendment. While thepreamble has no constitutional effect, many lawmakers believeit would influence legislation by which the amendment wouldbe enforced.   The preamble would designate the flag as &quot;a nationalsymbol of such stature that it must be kept inviolate.&quot; Thedocument says the amendment would prohibit desecration of theflag, including the display of the flag in a &quot;contemptuousmanner.&quot; Physical desecration, according to the preamble,would include &quot;burning, mutilating, defacing, defiling ortrampling,&quot; but wouldn't be limited to those forms ofdesecration.   The committee defeated proposals by Rep. William Hughes(D., N.J.) that would have limited the definition ofdesecration and restricted enforcement of the amendment tothe federal government.   &quot;We should not permit disparate interpretation by thestates and the hundreds of other jurisdictions around thecountry,&quot; he said. &quot;We should not allow the 50 states toestablish their own views of the flag of the United States.&quot;Mr. Hughes's amendment on federal enforcement failed by avote of 26-10.   Retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell joined theopponents of the proposed amendment. Justice Powell, who leftthe court in 1987, signed a statement issued by the EmergencyCommittee to Defend the First Amendment, opposing &quot;any effortto restrict the First Amendment&quot; by amending theConstitution.</TEXT></DOC>
