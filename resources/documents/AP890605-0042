President Bush said, ``There's a way for Iran's relationshipwith the United States to improve and that's for the release of theAmerican hostages.'' India proclaimed three days of mourning, andthe pope spoke of Khomeini's impact on the world. Iranian exiles inthe United States danced in the streets.   ``Iraq is looking only for a comprehensive peace with Iran basedon strong relations,'' the Iraqi state daily Al-Thawra said,referring to deadlocked peace negotiations since an Aug. 20cease-fire that ended their eight-year war. But Al-Thawra'scommentary also called Khomeini a ``grudge-bearing tyrant'' anddescribed Iran as ``disunited and confused.''   Iran's revolutionary patriarch died Sunday after suffering aheart attack while recovering from stomach surgery. He was 86.   Israel said it wants post-Khomeini Iran to renew formerlyfriendly ties ruptured by the revolution. Government spokesman AviPazner said Israel hopes for ``an ensuing future improvement inrelations.''   But Foreign Ministry spokesman Allon Liel called ``a littlepremature'' a newspaper report that Israel is seeking a dialoguewith the new regime.   The Kuwait Times echoed a hope expressed by many of Iran's Arabneighbors: that the new leadership will bring peace and ``guaranteepermanent stability in the region.''   In India, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's government declaredthree days of state mourning, canceling official entertainment andordering flags flown at half-staff. ``May the Iranian people andthe bereaved family have courage and fortitude to bear thisirreparable loss,'' Gandhi said in a message.   Pope John Paul II, speaking in Helsinki, said: ``It is necessaryto state with great respect and with deep reflection his impact onhis country and a considerable part of the world.''   Governments of most Persian Gulf states sent polite cables ofcondolence to Tehran but refrained from public comment on the deathof the man many of them held responsible for a decade of regionalinstability.   Oman was the only country among the six-nation Gulf CooperationCouncil to announce it is sending a delegation to the funeralTuesday.   The council groups Oman with Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, SaudiArabia and the United Arab Emirates, the six countries directly inthe firing line of Khomeini's pledge to export his fundamentalistbrand of Islam.   Saudi Arabia, the country with a particular grudge againstKhomeini's repeated attempts to politicize the annual pilgrimage toMecca, did not immediately send a cable of condolence.   In Lebanon, the only country outside Iran where Khomeini'sfundamentalism won a beachhead, 75,000 Shiite Moslem mournersprocessed through west Beirut chanting: ``Israel, Israel is our bigenemy! America, America is the great satan! Death to Israel! Deathto America!''   It is unclear whether Khomeini's death will affect the 15foreigners held hostage in Lebanon, most by pro-Iranian extremists.The hostages include AP correspondent Terry A. Anderson and eightother Americans.   In the United States, the Iranian leader's death prompted bothmourning and celebration. Wearing red, the Iranian color ofcelebration, 1,000 Iranian exiles danced for joy, chanting ``Deathto Khomeini! Long live Iran!''   ``The Iranians have gathered here in Los Angeles to congratulateeach other and resolve to work harder to overthrow the regime ofthe mullahs in Iran,'' said Habib Momayez, a former professor atTehran University.   Also on the West Coast, members of the Islamic Center ofSouthern California dedicated their noontime prayers to Khomeini,praised by many for the 1979 revolution that deposed the late Shahof Iran and established the rule of Islamic Shiites in the MiddleEastern nation.</TEXT></DOC>
