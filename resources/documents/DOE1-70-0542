The test results showthat the variance of degrees of sintering does not depend on CaO contentsin ash; however, the uranium extraction is increased as CaO contentsare increased in ash. Since CaO content in the ash is increased, theash tends to be more basic and can be easily attacked by acid, i.e. theuranium lock-up in ash can be easily released to the advantage of uraniumextraction. The data from tests also indicate that the constants a andb in the formula eta = [d/(ad - b)] x 100% are decreased with increaseof CaO content in ash. In addition, if leaching conditions are intensified,a,b will also be decreased. Thus it can be seen that a and b are in closerelation to the solubility of the ash itself.</TEXT></DOC>
