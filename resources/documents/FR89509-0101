Such efforts willneed to include demonstration projects on broadening the apprenticeshipconcept to include alternative approaches that will provide flexibility.The size and scope of the grant will be dependent upon the grant applicationsand evaluation of them as covered later in this announcement, but willnumber at least two varying approaches.This solicitation, which will result in the award of one (1) grant, isopen to public and private organizations. The awarded project will consistof two segments, one of approximately $50,000 for six months of preliminarywork and study of successful practices, issues identification, and developmentof recommendations for models; and the other for development and testingover about a 12-month period of at least three demonstration models (at$150,000 each) for alternative systems directed to broadening and increasingthe flexibility of the apprenticeship concept of training. The final sixmonths of the grant will be devoted to refining model systems and developingrecommendations for replication of systems as appropriate. DOL anticipatesthat proven and accepted new approaches will be established throughoutthe country with technical assistance and monitoring provided by apprenticeshipstaff of the DOL and State apprenticeship agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part I_Preamble</ITAG>A. IntroductionThe Department has devoted substantial resources over the last two yearsto identifying changes in the workplace that are likely to occur duringthe remaining years of this century and into the next. From this effort,ETA is focusing on issues relating to the American work force and its trainingneeds.In December 1987, the Department launched the Apprenticeship 2000 initiativewith the publication of an issue paper in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>52 FR 45904 December 2, 1987. The purpose ofthis initiative is to review the apprenticeship concept to determine itsfuture role in meeting America's needs for a skilled work force. The basic premise of the initiative is that scrutiny should be given tothe apprenticeship concept of structured on-the-job training combined withrelated classroom instruction, and serious consideration given to increasingthe role of this concept in preparing workers for skilled jobs. This isa concept which holds potential for meeting both the needs of employersin industries facing skill shortages as well as the needs of targeted populations,such as workers who may periodically require retraining or upgrading, dislocatedworkers, or the at-risk youth population. Two key components of this initiative are: (1) A public dialogue, and (2)a two-phased research program. The first phase of the research programconsisted of short-term research papers; the second phase will involvelonger-term projects. The purpose of the first phase of the research program was to analyze carefullya number of key issues and to develop and support recommendations for thefuture direction of apprenticeship. These short-term projects were completedin October 1988 and will be used in preparing the report of findings andrecommendations on the future role of apprenticeship. The second phase of the research program, the longer-term projects, willinclude demonstration projects and such features as testing the feasibilityof expanding the apprenticeship concept of training to a broadened structuredworkpace training system that can address additional industries, testingalternative delivery systems, increasing the efficiency and quality ofoperations, and testing approaches to targeted groups. This Solicitation for Grant Application (SGA) represents one of the areasto be investigated further. It will provide a thorough consideration ofadaptation of current apprenticeship to structured workplace training systempolicies and procedures to be proposed to better meet the skilled trainingneeds of the American work force in the future. B. Background The Department has determined that the National Apprenticeship System hasthe potential for playing a significant role in addressing our country'sprojected need for an increased number of skilled workers in an economythat is undergoing demographic changes and that is facing unprecedentedinternational competition. However, in order to meet challenges the apprenticeshipsystem must expand, adapt to changing conditions, and increase its flexibility.In order to accomplish these goals DOL is awarding a grant to provide forthe development and testing of a number of model approaches to allow forexpansion of the apprenticeship training concept to a broadened structuredworkplace training system accessible to non-traditional occupations, industries,and target groups and to provide a flexibility that will permit the systemto readily adapt to a volatile economy and work force. The grant awardedwill be directed to at least two possible approaches. Briefly the approachesto be studied are: <ITAG tagnum="81">(a) Career Ladder </ITAG>To test whether a broadened structured workplace training system can enableindividuals to upgrade their skills in order to move into higher skilllevel occupations. <ITAG tagnum="81">(b) Upgrade/Refresher </ITAG>To test whether a structured workplace training system can be used to provideworkers with refresher or upgrade training to enable them to adapt to newworkplace technologies. Additional related information can be found in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at 52 FR 40326 (October 14, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="84">Part II_Programmatic Topics </ITAG>A. Scope The grantee shall provide all personnel, materials, and facilities forthe area of study to produce reports as later described and to test theapproved system. B. Statement of Work This grant will involve thorough study and understanding of the currentapprenticeship delivery system and exploration of the feasibility of developinga number of alternative models which will result in a more flexible structuredworkplace training system that will provide increased skilled trainingopportunities for the American work force, including opportunities forat-risk youth, dislocated and older workers, minorities and women. Work on this grant will be performed in two major parts: (1) For the first six months of the grant a literature search and compilationand review of information will be conducted on other attempts, successfuland unsuccessful, of programs to address skill training needs of dislocatedworkers, older workers, at-risk youth, minorities and women. Meetings anddiscussions will be conduted to obtain information from sponsors of theseprograms, of apprenticeship program sponsors, both labor and management,and of individuals from the target groups. Information sought will include,but not be limited to, successful attempts, problem identification, howproblems were resolved, failures and why they failed, needs of employersand their interest and willingness to participate in flexible structuredworkplace training concept programs focused at the target groups, skilltraining needs and problems of the targeted population.Collected information will be summarized, analyzed and recommendationsmade for development of varying models that would assist the target groupsto receive structured workplace training in a practical and successfulmanner with long-term benefits.(2) Upon completion of (1) above, and upon approval by the federal representative,the next 12 months of the grant period will be devoted to the developmentof at least three demonstration programs and testing of the practicalityof previously developed recommendations. The Department will probably proposesome demonstration sites.Three or more different demonstration programs will be developed and initiatedduring the twelve-month period in varying localities of the country. Granteewill be responsible for all aspects of developing a system or systems thattest the approaches indicated earlier and in the previously referenced<T4>Federal Register</T4>. System development activity would include, forexample, program direction, on-the-job training and related theoreticalinstruction, credential and certification sub-systems, upgrade training,outreach efforts to targeted groups, recordkeeping, and program monitoring.Such programs do not have to be for the traditional apprenticeable occupations.An evaluation component is expected for each demonstration program. Developmentof the program must include appropriate contact with local and State government,labor, management, and education officials. Long-term continuance of thetested programs must be addressed and considered in the evaluation component.Demonstration program should focus primarily in non-construction industrieswith emphasis on manufacturing, high tech and service occupations, <T3>e.g., </T3>medical areas. The final six months of the grant will bespent on refining the model systems and developing recommendations forreplication of the system as appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part III_Application Process</ITAG>An original and four copies of the grant application package shall be submitted.The application package shall consist of two (2) separate and distinctparts.
