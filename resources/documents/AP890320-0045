The first round of the municipal elections was held last week. Incommunities where no slate won 50 percent of the vote then, allslates that won at least 10 percent were eligible to participate inthe second round.   Turnout in this ninth trip to the polls for the French in lessthan a year was estimated at between 72 and 73.5 percent.   Conservative bastions such as Strasbourg, Mulhouse, Brest,Dunkirk, Orleans, Blois, Avignon and Quimper fell into Socialisthands on Sunday. The right made some inroads into leftist territory,but in general won fewer, smaller cities.   Many of the conservatives' problems were caused by the extremeright National Front, which siphoned votes from the traditionalrightist parties in the runoffs. The conservative Rally for theRepublic (RPR) and the center-right Union for French Democracy (UDF)refused to deal with the National Front for second-round support.   ``It would be an exaggeration to believe that we are seeing agrassroots wave for the presidential majority,'' said RPR SecretaryGeneral Alain Juppe. ``It's true that the Socialist Party isretaking a part of the terrain that it had lost in 1983, but only apart.''   The overall number of municipalities with a population of morethan 30,000 lost by the right was small, but the right lostimportant cities while taking smaller, less important ones from theleft.   The right had made serious gains in the country's city councilsin 1983, two years after the Socialists came to power nationally.   Said former conservative Premier Jacques Chirac, mayor of Pariswho turned in one of the few smashing victories of the night: ``Onthe national level, we have seen the Socialists win back cities theylost six years ago. And it is a victory for them. On the other hand,the number of abstentionists, the large number of votes for theEcologist and National Front slates, expresses a malaise.''   Perhaps the Socialists' most satisfying victory came inStrasbourg, where they ousted an incumbent center-right mayor in anelection in which the Ecologist slate also won 12 percent.   The results confirmed the leftist trend that re-electedMitterrand last spring and gave him a leftist majority in theNational Assembly. Frequently, local elections are used as a meansof protesting government policy, but that was not the case thisyear. Races largely were fought on local issues.   There was a little good news on the right, however. Chirac, whowon a ``grand slam'' in 1983 by taking all 20 of Paris' districts,repeated the feat, despite a cliffhanger in the 20th district whereNational Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen's slate drew away a lot ofvotes.   It was satisfying for Chirac, who took a battering fromMitterrand in presidential elections last May.   Another ``grand slam'' was registered by Michel Noir, aconservative deputy in the National Assembly and former foreigntrade minister. Noir, a dynamic, 45-year-old politician, won allnine of the districts in the southeastern city of Lyon, France'sthird-largest municipality, defeating a center-right incumbent.   Le Pen said the traditional right's strategy of refusing to dealwith the National Front had failed yet again. ``The National Fronthas shown by its sucess that it (accepting the National Front) isunavoidable.''   The Front's campaign focusings largely on anti-immigration andlaw and order issues.</TEXT></DOC>
