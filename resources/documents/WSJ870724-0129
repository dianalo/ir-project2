Bill Clements of Texas finally cried uncle this week. After winning last year on a campaign promise to veto new taxes as a means of balancing the state's budget, he just signed a $5.7 billion tax increase -- the largest increase by any state in the nation's history.    Gov. Clements tried to limit the political damage by saying the state was increasing only established taxes such as those on sales and that he still rejected the &quot;creation&quot; of new taxes. That evasive maneuver won't hide the fact that Texas is trying to make up for the dramatic drop in energy prices by pursuing tax policies that are an intellectual and economic dry hole.    Despite enormous political pressures, the tax increases barely passed -- the vote in the Texas House was only 78 to 72 in favor. The sales tax will go from 5 1/4% to 6%, professionals such as doctors and lawyers will pay a $110 occupational tax and levies on business franchises, motor vehicles and hotel visits will go up.    The Texas fiscal crisis is the result of last year's downturn in oil prices. The state has profited from not having a personal or corporate income tax, but this absence meant state government was heavily dependent on taxes levied on the oil industry.    Economics writer Warren Brookes says that if Texas had to raise taxes it should have levied much higher consumer taxes on gasoline to replace the lower revenues from corporate oil production; consumers merely would have paid what the price of gas was before the oil-price drop. The tax could have been reduced gradually as crude-oil prices rose -- as they did this week to $22 a barrel. Instead, the state raised the sales tax -- an increase not likely ever to be repealed.    Conservative legislators proposed cutting the state budget instead of raising taxes, but few had concrete proposals to save money. The two-year $38.5 billion state budget included only modest spending reductions. &quot;It's when government is in crisis that imaginative solutions have the most chance of passing,&quot; says former Texas Congressman Ron Paul. &quot;But no one pushed saving money by having the private sector do things the government has monopolized.&quot; Turning such programs as prison operations, highway maintenance and school-lunch programs over to the private sector wouldn't have balanced the state's budget but would have meant substantial long-term savings as well as a more efficient delivery of services.    The real danger to the Texas economy now is that the tax increases soon will be attacked as inadequate. Politicians then will call for creation of a state personal or corporate income tax. Ominously, a panel already has been appointed to make recommendations next year on changes in the state's tax structure.    Texas is one of only six states without a personal income tax -- one reason why it has been able to diversify its economy into the financial and service sectors. Imposing such a tax would help undermine the state's economic future. A 1985 study by economist Richard Vedder of Ohio University compared the growth rates of the 10 states that either had no personal income tax or a very small one with the 10 states that had the highest personal income taxes. He found that the least-taxed states had growth rates three and one-half times that of the highest-taxed states. Texas can't afford to give up that kind of advantage.    The Lone Star State traditionally has had low taxes, so while most people opposed this week's tax increases there was no great outpouring of public outrage. &quot;The eyes of Texas were not upon the state legislators this vacation season,&quot; says James Meadows, a Corpus Christi businessman. That attitude may change when people feel the Texas taxman's hands in their pockets. </TEXT></DOC>
