If each automobile maker used a differentarrangement for the gas, brake, and clutch pedals? If every battery and lightbulb company used different sizes and terminal arrangements?andM;Interfaces are present at many levels in computer systems.andP;  At the chiplevel, the interface is the pin definitions and the chip's behavior inresponse to signals on those pins.andP;  At a more abstract level, the instructionset architecture is the interface between the software and the hardware.andP;  Atthe system level, there are many hardware interfaces: the keyboard interface,the disk drive interface, the display interface, the expansion bus, and soforth.andP;  Finally, at the highest level is the user interface.andM;Each of these interfaces may be protected, in varying degrees, by patents orcopyrights.andP;  Patents are the most troublesome because they prohibitindependently developed expressions of the same idea.andP;  Copyrights areapplicable primarily to the user interface.andM;When a company designs a computer system, each of the interfaces involvesnumerous choices.andP;  For example, IBM wanted a serial connection to its PCkeyboard that used as few wires as possible.andP;  IBM's engineers devised ascheme for using a single open-collector line as both a data signal and ahandshake signal, and patented this technique.andP;  Every IBM-compatible systemthat uses the standard PC-compatible keyboard interface violates this patent,which IBM fortunately decided not to enforce, for the most part.andM;These interface details are rarely the source of a product's success orfailure; they are simply details that had to be implemented one way oranother.andP;  If the vendor can implement the interface in a way that ispatentable, then the patent can be used to keep competitors off the market orextract some of their profits.andM;The user interface is the murkiest area.andP;  Tb the degree that the userinterface represents artistic expression, it seems reasonable to provideprotection.andP;  I do not believe, however, that user interface concepts-such asoverlapping windows or pull-down menus-should be protectable.andP;  Copyrights aresupposed to protect expression only, but they are being interpreted in adangerously broad manner.andM;The patent and copyright systems should be modified to take into account thebest interests of the industry and its consumers, and one way to do this isto eliminate protection for interfaces.andP;  It should be legal to develop amodem that responds to the same commands as another; to develop a chip thatworks just like another; or to write a program that acts just like another.andO;Copying the internal workings shouldn't necessarily be allowed, but mimickingexternal behavior should not be prohibited.andM;Most companies don't agree with this view.andP;  They argue that theirintellectual property rights must be protected to allow them to continue toinvest in new developments, but the evidence doesn't support this assertion.andO;All too often, &quot;protecting our intellectual property&quot; really means &quot;defendingour market,&quot; and this defense should be achieved through superior productsand marketing, not by legal barriers.andM;Intel didn't need patent protection to justify developing the 386; it is thesheer difficulty of producing an equivalent device that has protected Intel'smarket.andP;  Hayes didn't need to protect its modem's software interface; thecompany has fared very well, despite the fact that many other companies haveused the patented escape sequence.andP;  Apple can continue to be a successfulcomputer company by developing superior products and leveraging itsrelationships with its third-party developers, dealers, and customers.andP;  Theadvantages of incumbency-such as manufacturing experience, distributionchannels, market image, and customer loyalty-are potent enough withoutproviding additional legal shields against competition.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
