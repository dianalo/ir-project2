The proposed legislation stems from the congressionalinvestigation into allegations that proceeds of secret arms salesto Iran during the Reagan administration were diverted to theNicaraguan Contra rebels.   The first provision would make it a felony for a federalemployee to solicit money to support foreign policy activities forwhich Congress had prohibited funding. Violators could beimprisoned for up to five years, or fined, or both.   The second provision would bar government officials fromengaging in ``quid pro quo'' deals, in which foreign assistancewould be given to a country in exchange for that country's carryingout an activity for which Congress had barred funding.   The amendments, to the State Department authorization bill forfiscal 1990, were introduced by Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.   ``I offer these amendments on behalf of our foreign service andintelligence officers who all too often have been asked to violatean imperative of the United States Constitution: To take care thatthe laws be faithfully executed,'' Moynihan said.</TEXT></DOC>
