The other alternativesin descending order of impact are belowground vaults, enhanced shallowland burial, augered holes, modular concrete containers, and earth moundedconcrete bunker monoliths. The maximum exposure is received approximately10,000 years after the closure of the facility and results primarilyfrom the long-lived isotopes I-129 and C-14. This maximum dose is approximatelyfour orders of magnitude below that received from natural backgroundradiation and two orders of magnitude below the level proposed by NRCas the lower limit for consideration in developing population dose commitments.It is not anticipated that any public exposure would result in the groundwaterfrom migration of nuclides emplaced in a mine. Similarly, the groundwatermay not be the critical exposure pathway for at-or abovegrade technologies.39 refs., 3 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
