Perez de Cuellar did not disclose the Iranian envoy's responseand Velayati later did not answer reporters' questions about thehostages.   Earlier Wednesday, Perez de Cuellar told reporters he thoughtIran might help on the hostage issue for ``humanitarian andpolitical'' reasons.   The question was raised in talks concerning the implementationof a cease-fire in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq War.   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's parliament speaker and militarycommander, offered on Tuesday to help get the nine Americans freedif the United States would release Iranian assets frozen since 1979.   U.S. officials said Washington would not ransom the Americans,who are among 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon. Held longest of the18 is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press, who was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.   ``I intend to do it (raise the hostage issue with Iran) becauseI feel that their good offices will be very good for obtaining therelease of the hostages,'' the secretary-general told reportersearlier.   ``I think they might assert their possible influence in order tohave this problem out of the way for both the humanitarian andpolitical business.''   He said the hostages were a ``parallel issue'' to ending thewar. Perez de Cuellar has pursued the hostage question previouslywith Iranians and others.   Rafsanjani said Tuesday: ``If they (the Americans) really wantto talk, let them take a non-hostile pose by releasing our assets.If so, we will use our influence in Lebanon and intercede to solvethe problem of hostages.''   In a meeting with reporters Tuesday, Velayati said ``The problemof hostages in Lebanon is a question relating to the Lebanese.   ``It is not our question, but on the basis of humanitarianaspects we will do our best, as we have done till now, and we dohope that all innocent people as hostages in Lebanon or anyplaceelse ... could be released very soon.''   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters said Wednesday he believed thesecretary-general's ``good offices could help. What was ineffectivein the old days may not be so today. Things are moving, things arechanging.''   Asked about Rafsanjani's statement and the U.S. response,Walters said: ``We are not closing the door on anything. Wemaintain the policy that we do not pay blackmail.   ``The hostages are ... with us day and night, in our heart andour mind always, and we will do whatever is honorable and decentand won't provoke more hostage taking.''   Walters said he has visited Syria five times to discuss thematter and ``the important thing for us is to liberate the hostagesin such a way that they won't be replaced by another group ofhostages.''</TEXT></DOC>
