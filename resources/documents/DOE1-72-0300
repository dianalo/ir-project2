If H{sub 0}not =0, there is additional even-harmonicgeneration. The even-harmonic power displays a very sharp dip at H{sub0}{similar_to}0, of width {similar_to}100 {mu}G. This and related behaviorcan be semiquantitatively understood by modeling the system as a suitablyaveraged collection of flux-quantized supercurrent loops containing Josephsonjunctions.</TEXT></DOC>
