(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Doctors and nurses scurry to make theirrounds and patients in wheelchairs and gurneys fill the halls. Itlooks like an ordinary hospital but the patients are convictedfelons, among them swindlers and spies.   The Federal Medical Center could just as easily be a collegecampus with its open spaces, tree-lined walkways and outdoorrecreational facility that includes a basketball court, ice rink andjogging path. The combined prison and hospital moved onto thegrounds of a former state hospital that closed in 1982.   ``We want the appearance to be reasonably attractive,'' saidWarden Joseph Bogan. ``We think it would be unproductive and unwiseto tear down the trees, remove the grass and put in concrete.''   The tranquil scene has its limits. The 55-acre center issurrounded by a double razor-wire fence, patrol trucks carryingarmed guards circle the complex and computerized sensing devicesdetect movement along the perimeter.   But unlike most federal prisons, the Federal Medical Centerconcentrates security on the perimeter and allows inmates relativefreedom inside the fences. There are no bars on the windows of thelow-to-medium-security facility and inmates do not need passes tomove about the campus.   The prison, located in this southeastern Minnesota town of 60,000that's home to the Mayo Clinic, admits federal convicts who needmedical or psychiatric care. The only similar institution, theMedical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, Mo., is ahigh-security facility.   In Rochester, guards within the perimeter do not carry weapons.Inmates are aware of the prison's policy that it will not give in tothe demands of prisoners in the event of a hostage situation, JohnChreno, executive assistant to the warden, said recently. No one hastried to escape since the first prisoners arrived in October 1984,he said.   ``You wouldn't even know you're in prison here,'' said MichaelRosenow, who is serving a three-year sentence for tax evasion.Rosenow works in the prison's business office during the day andtakes classes at night.   Frederick Coffey, who is serving time for a fraud conviction,described the atmosphere as ``much more relaxed'' than other prisons.   ``My idea of being incarcerated was the bar (on the windows)scene, but we're mostly free to move around here,'' he said.   Bogan defended the prison against criticism that it coddlescriminals.   ``Most of our inmates will be back among us eventually and it'sin society's best interests not to brutalize them,'' he said.   The hospital, which employs eight full-time physicians, 57 nursesand 72 other medical personnel, can treat most illnesses exceptthose requiring kidney dialysis, Chreno said. The prisoners often goto the nearby Mayo Clinic for treatment, and clinic doctors come tothe prison for consulting work or to perform surgery.   ``Patients come here for everything from severe mental disordersto personality disorders to terminal cancer to orthopedic work,''Chreno said. ``We represent a cross section of the illnesses ofsociety. There's nothing in society that's not represented by someoffender.''   About half of the prison's approximately 580 patients work in thekitchen, on the grounds crew or in a factory which makes cables forthe government.   About 120 inmates are there for medical reasons, about 75 forpsychiatric treatment and others for chemical dependency.   Criminals who have spent time at Rochester include FBI agentRichard Miller, who was sentenced in January 1986 to life in prisonfor spying for the Soviet Union; Lee Alexander, the former mayor ofSyracuse, N.Y., sentenced to 10 years for running anextortion-kickback scheme; and Anne Pollard, who is serving afive-year term for helping her husband sell documents to Israel.   The prison drew opposition when the plans for it were announced.Gertrude Tyce, who led the fight, said she still believes prisonsdon't belong in neighborhoods.   ``But it's here now and we're not going to sit and crab about itforever,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
