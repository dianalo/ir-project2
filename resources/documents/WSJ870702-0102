Mr. Gray, whose term as chairman expired two days ago, has been provided an office and a secretary in a division of the Federal Home Loan Bank System for an indefinite period &quot;just so he could wind up his affairs,&quot; according to a Bank Board spokesman. Mr. Gray, 51 years old isn't drawing a salary and is still seeking employment, the spokesman said.    Mr. Gray wasn't reappointed and was succeeded by M. Danny Wall, the former Republican staff director of the Senate Banking Committee.    The Federal Home Loan Banks, authorized by Congress, are owned by the 3,200 federally insured savings and loan institutions. </TEXT></DOC>
