This rulemaking would grant general approval fora type of vessel charter involving drilling contracts for the employmentof mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs). Such general approval wouldbe granted to drilling contracts (a form of transfer), for a period notto exceed two years, where the MODU owner is a citizen of the United Statesand the other party is a noncitizen affiliate of the owner or the personmaking the vessel available for charter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>MARAD will consider all written comments by interestedpersons received on or before April 24, 1989.

As amended by Pub. L. 100-710, section 9 contains exceptions tothe requirements for approval of all transfers to noncitizens of interestsin documented vessels with respect to vessels operated only as a fishingvessel, fish processing vessel, fish tender vessel or a vessel operatedonly for pleasure (46 CFR 221.15(b)). By its regulations at 46 CFR Part221, MARAD has granted administrative general approval for charters ofdocumented vessels by citizens to noncitizens for a period not to exceedsix months. This general approval is specifically inapplicable to all bareboatcharters or subcharters, other than with respect to vessel types that areexempt from transfer approval under andSection; 221.15(b). A bareboat charteris one where the charterer takes possession of the vessel and exercisesdirect control over the actual operation of the vessel.In response to a petition for rulemaking submitted by the InternationalAssociation of Drilling Contractors (IADC), MARAD issued an Advance Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on November 2, 1988 (53 FR 44206). The ANPRMsolicited comments, due by January 3, 1989, on the IADC proposal that MARADgrant general approval for bareboat charters and subchapters of mobileoffshore drilling units (MODUs) by citizens of the United States to affiliateswhich are noncitizens. The IADC represents offshore and onshore drillingand well-servicing companies that it claims are responsible for producingover 90 percent of all onshore and offshore wells drilled around the worldsince March 31, 1987. IADC membership includes drilling and well-servicingcontractors, oil and gas producing firms, and associate member companies.Petitioner alleged that amendment to MARAD's regulations should provideapproval for intra-company charters and subcharters, irrespective of duration,to ensure that American offshore drilling companies obtain their fair shareof overseas drilling contracts. Petitioner stated that MARAD general approvalof intra-company charters to noncitizen affiliates is needed because suchcharters are an integral part of doing business abroad in the offshoredrilling industry, and much of the new offshore drilling activity now occursoutside of the United States and its contiguous waters. It projected thatfuture opportunities will continue to be concentrated in foreign countries.Petitioner stated that while MARAD has routinely approved applicationsfor intra-company charters of MODUs, approval can take at least severalweeks and as much as one month. A necessary response time on solicitationsfor foreign drilling contracts is often very short, typically 14 days.Offerors that must wait for MARAD approval to execute a charter or drillingcontract are at a disadvantage in competing with foreign competitors thatdo not need to get approval. Petitioner stated that many drilling contractsand related bareboat charters are of short duration and require the shortestresponse time.The IADC proposed amendment also would require the vessel owner or owner'srepresentative to file a copy of the charter with MARAD not later than20 days after the beginning of the charter period.The proposed amendments in the ANPRM were to the regulations at 46 CFRPart 221 that existed prior to MARAD's publication of an interim finalrule, on February 2, 1989, (54 FR 5382). MARAD issued that rulemaking toconform its regulations to reflect significant changes in the law containedin Pub. L. 100-170, which became effective on January 1, 1989. The IADCproposed amendment provided for MARAD general approval of charters of adocumented MODU by a citizen to a noncitizen affiliate, as defined, withouttime limitation.MARAD received five comments in response to the ANPRM. Generally favorablecomments were received from two offshore drilling operators, a trade associationrepresenting offshore drilling operators and other maritime interests,and a law firm representing an offshore drilling operator. Another lawfirm representing an operator of ocean-going tug barges in the coastwisetrade opposed the ``generic extension of this approval authority'' by MARAD.That commenter submitted that it is important to examine vessel transferssubject to section 9 under rigorous case-by-case review to learn whetherthe transfer would be compatible with national interests, including nationaldefense. It stated that there is not a demonstrated need for such an amendmentof the MARAD regulations governing transfers of documented vessels to noncitizens.In proposing these amendments, MARAD has determined that the vessel transfersthat are contemplated are compatible with national interests.One offshore drilling operator suggested a further amendment to requirethat a MARAD general approval be granted for a period not to exceed twoyears, and only for drilling contracts that assure that the U.S. citizenowner retains control of the marine operations, noting that the majorityof drilling contracts give the operator the right to take over drillingoperations. Those provisions are incorporated in this NPRM. The same commenteralso would eliminate the requirement in the ANPRM that the vessel owneror owner's representative file with MARAD a copy of the charter withintwenty days after the beginning of a charter period, and would substitutethe requirement for filing a written notice of the charter and its expectedcommencement and termination dates. Another offshore drilling operatoropposed the requirement for submitting a copy of the charter as being unnecessarypaperwork. A similar requirement is now applicable to charters, not toexceed six months, pursuant to provision of andSection; 221.17(c). Therehave been no protests from those now subject to this requirement, whichhas existed since 1986. Consistent with that provision, a time period ofthirty days is now being proposed, rather than the twenty days providedfor in the ANPRM.The law firm representing an offshore drilling operator noted that underPub. L. 100-710, transfers to noncitizens of a documented vessel do notrequite MARAD approval if the owner is not a citizen of the United States.That commenter would require that the noncitizen affiliate be related toeither the owner or the entity making the vessel available for charter,and that provision is being incorporated in this NPRM.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Regulatory Impact  </ITAG>This rulemaking has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291, and it hasbeen determined that this is not a major rule. It will not result in anannual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. There will be noincrease in production costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local governments, agencies, or geographic regions. Furthermore,it will not adversely affect competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.  This rulemaking does not involve any change in important Departmental policiesand is considered nonsignificant under Department of Transportation Regulatorypolicies and procedures (DOT Order 2100.5). The economic impact shouldbe minimal, and further regulatory evaluation is not necessary. Moreover,the Maritime Administrator certifies that this amendment will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rulemaking does not significantly affect the environment. An environmentalimpact statement is not required under the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969. It has also been reviewed under Executive Order 12612, Federalism,and it has been determined that it does not have sufficient implicationsfor federalism to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  Finally, this rulemaking contains a reporting requirement that has beenpreviously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (Approval No.2133-0006).  MARAD has reviewed the comments received in response to the ANPRM, withrecognition of the changes in the regulations at 46 CFR Part 221 that hasbeen effected by the interim final rule published on February 2, 1989,in implementation of Pub. L. 100-710. This notice of proposed rulemakingwould add a new paragraph ``(f) <T3>Drilling Contracts'' </T3>to andSection; 221.17, which would give MARADgeneral approval for drilling contracts relating to any documented MODU,not to exceed two years in duration, where the MODU owner is a citizenof the United States and the other contracting partner (charterer) is anoncitizen.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 221  </ITAG>Maritime Administration, maritime carriers.Accordingly, it is proposed to amend the regulations at 46 CFR Part 221as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 221_[AMENDED]  </ITAG>1.
