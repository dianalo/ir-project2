Irkutsk is an inevitable tour stop for travelers on the Trans-Siberian Railway. In late summer it is leafy and quiet and dusty.    The bustle in Karl Marx Avenue is nominal, and in the &quot;private sector&quot; market. The sellers of radishes and cucumbers are bored. So are the frozen fish merchants, but the poultry dealers are busy, watched vacantly by customers in line.    Irkutsk is an old town, dating from the 17th century, when it first prospered in the fur trade with China. Later it became a center for exiles and political prisoners, some of whom remained in the city's prisons and others who were subjected to penal servitude in the silver mines farther east.    Best known were the Decembrists, idealistic aristocratic reformers on the American model, who rose clumsily against the czar in 1825. Joined by their families from Petersburg and Moscow, they cultivated the civilized arts in a rude frontier society and a ruder climate. Thus did Irkutsk begin to be known as the Paris of Siberia.    The house of one of their leaders, Prince Trubetskoy, has been preserved as a museum, since the Soviet state considers the Decembrists heralds of the revolution of 1917. It is a typical Siberian log house surrounded by ragged beds of cosmos and monkshood, but it is two stories high and has elegant proportions inside. A salon is full of Biedermeier furniture made of native birch. And portraits, porcelains, books and musical instruments recall the gifts the exiles brought with them.    The museum director, a scholarly man of 40, suggests a character in Chekhov, with his wire spectacles down his nose, his stooped shoulders and courtly manner. He speaks animatedly of the Trubetskoy family, whose daughters painted in watercolor and launched a young ladies' seminary.    Leading the way to a mahogany harmonium in a corner surmounted by a bust of Bach, he sat down at the keyboard and for five minutes gave himself up to one of the master's preludes. Then he explained, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, that the harmonium was made 100 years ago in Pennsylvania. All this had more the shape of a venerated relic of imperial Russia than a monument to the revolution.    Irkutsk has a particular claim on American interest since it was from here in the 18th century that Alaska was explored and colonized by Russian seafarers and merchants. By the time the czar sold it to the U.S. in 1867, there were 43 Russian villages and harbors from the Bering Sea down to California and 12,000 colonists. Its capital was New Archangel, now Sitka, and its commerce throve on pelts of seal and sea otter.    The chief author of this was Gregory Shelikhov, who established the first settlement on Kodiak Island in 1784. His funerary monument -- in the form of a handsome gray-and-white marble pyramid -- stands in the grounds of the Znamensky Convent in outlying Irkutsk near the wide, icy Angara River.    It is a verdant precinct, surrounded by walls and guarded by a gatehouse. Some of the Decembrists lie here too, notably Elizabeth Trubetskoy, on whose grave someone had today laid a bunch of roses.    The tombs surround the &quot;functioning&quot; (in the official phrase) Church of the Holy Trinity, of white brick and stucco and richly ornamented. The icon-covered interior is dim and smoky, as a new generation of candles add their dark luster to all those that have gone before.    I took a taxi to revisit the convent, as the tour guide gave it scant attention. The driver, bald, strapping and mustached, approved vigorously of my inspection -- if not of Shelikhov then certainly of the church. He gave me to understand he was a respectful agnostic. And so, for a moment, we meditated on all this together.    ---   Mr. King is director of the Foreign Press Center in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
