Foreign governments pledged nearly $54 billion in cash andother forms of assistance to underwrite the cost of theconflict. But congressional budget experts increasinglybelieve that the eventual cost is likely to end up between$40 billion and $45 billion. Those lower estimates, amongother things, reflect a significantly shorter ground war,fewer destroyed planes and tanks, a smaller transportationbill to bring troops home, and more favorable world-wide fuelcosts than the Pentagon assumed when it developed the initialcost estimates months ago.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I don't see how the {overall war} costs could be muchmore than $40 billion, and I wouldn't be surprised if it'scloser to $35 billion,&quot; Comptroller General Charles Bowsher,Congress's top financial watchdog, said in an interview lastFriday.   To try to capitalize on the potential windfall, criticscontend that the Pentagon is scrambling to inflate somewar-related expenditures. The Congressional Budget Office andthe General Accounting Office, which Mr. Bowsher heads,already have begun compiling a list of what they considerquestionable supply, maintenance and weapons-acquisitioncosts that Pentagon brass want to include in the overallassessment of war expenses.   The Pentagon, for instance, &quot;assumes that all equipmentand munitions lost on the war {will} be replaced&quot; despite theslated defense-spending reductions through the late 1990s,according to one CBO analysis. Pentagon estimates of anaverage $2 billion a month jump in day-to-day operating costswhen troops weren't in combat also &quot;seem high,&quot; according tothe same study. Congressional analysts skeptical of thoseestimates point out that the comparable monthly costsamounted to $2 billion when fighting was most fierce duringthe height of the Vietnam War.   &quot;If it turns out that there is money left on the table,the Department of Defense is certain to try to claim it,&quot;Rep. John Spratt (D., S.C.), a senior member of the ArmedServices Committee and a former Pentagon budget analyst,asserted in a recent interview. &quot;One way or the other, thePentagon will claim it as incremental costs stemming from thewar,&quot; he said.   The war-related spending measures Congress approved lastFriday carefully reserve for lawmakers the final say over howany potential windfall to the Treasury will be divided. Anddeficit-conscious legislators aren't likely to seriouslycontemplate returning excess funds to the allies.   But already, the complex, politically charged issue of howto calculate the legitimate costs of the fighting and itsaftermath has provoked ill feelings from some U.S. allies,especially Germany. Last week, the German government paid$3.8 billion of its $5.5 billion pledge to the U.S., but notbefore a spokesman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl publicly raisedquestions about some of the Treasury's projections.   So far, the Treasury has received total cash contributionsof more than $23 billion -- including a $5.7 billion paymentby Japan last week -- and most of the remaining outstandingpledges are owed by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Both countriesare expected to make good on those commitments withoutchallenging U.S. cost estimates.   But resolving disputes between the Pentagon and CapitolHill over how to spend the money is likely to provecontentious. In spite of the revised congressional estimates,the White House and military leaders continue to argue thatthe &quot;true incremental costs&quot; of the war -- taking intoaccount equipment wear and tear, replacement of munitions andthe extra expenses to maintain a large U.S. force in theregion for at least a few more months -- is likely to climbto $60 or $65 billion. Instead of speculating about potentialwindfalls, the Bush administration maintains that all of theallied pledges of help are likely to fall short of footingthat bill.   In an interview with a group of reporters last Friday,Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,went out of his way to defend those higher estimates. &quot;Thecost that we have provided . . . should be well within theballpark,&quot; Gen. Powell said. &quot;I am not carrying around . . .a number that is different from what we have been publiclyputting out there.&quot; If all of the allied pledges are kept, heemphasized, the administration is still leaning towardseeking additional war-related appropriations from Congressin the next fiscal year.   Other high-ranking administration officials take an evenlonger view. &quot;Every person who fights in a war becomeseligible for {a military} pension and compensation,&quot; arguedanother administration official involved in the debate, whichhe said is certain to add billions of dollars to thelong-term cost. The official added that unanticipated wearand tear of equipment also raises the costs. &quot;It will have tobe repaired, and it will have to be replaced sooner&quot; thananticipated, he predicted.   Wall Street analysts who have been scrutinizing recentTreasury budget statements also claim to see signs that thegovernment overestimated the cost of the war. Elliott Platt,director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin andJenrette, a securities firm, said that defense outlays lastmonth were roughly the same as in February 1990. &quot;It doesn'tseem in February that Desert Storm/Desert Shield outlays haveadded to the costs of our government,&quot; Mr. Platt said. &quot;Thatdoes raise the question about whether or not our allies willwind up overpaying.&quot;   Mr. Platt acknowledged that &quot;in kind&quot; contributions to themilitary effort, such as oil, food and other items providedby Saudi Arabia, aren't reflected in the Treasury statement.But he said most military operating costs should be included.</TEXT></DOC>
