Tehran television reported Eftekhar Jahroomi, legal adviser toIranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, rejected any link because theU.S. decision Monday complied with a U.S.-Iranian claims commissionin the Hague set up in 1981 after talks in Algiers.   ``The payment was solely in line with the Algiers agreements,''Jahroomi was quoted as saying by the broadcast, monitored inCyprus. ``Iran's claims against American banks were similarlypaid.''   Nowbari Heirani, Iran's representative at the internationalcourt also said the released assets ``have nothing to do with thehostages,'' the report said.   Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi said Thursday repayment ofthe assets had ``nothing to do with good will.''   President Bush said Tuesday he hoped the U.S. move will promptIran to obtain freedom for the eight American hostages in Lebanon.The State Department said the decision itself was not influenced bythe hostage issue.   Rafsanjani, leader of the so-called pragmatists in Iran, told anews conference last month Iran would help secure the release ofthe 18 Western hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon ifWashington unblocks Iranian assets.   Iran claims the assets frozen a decade ago are as much as $12billion, including the value of weapons purchased before the 1979Islamic revolution but never delivered.   The assets were blocked after militants stormed the U.S. Embassyin Tehran Nov. 4, 1979, and held American diplomats and otherpersonnel hostage. Fifty-two captives were released 444 days later.   The longest-held hostage in Lebanon is Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who waskidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
