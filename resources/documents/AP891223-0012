One man even left a note on the window of his private bus thatwas parked on the street just outside Carnegie Hall. It read: ``Yo,Clint, loved the show.''   One problem though: The man was a city policeman, and he alsoleft behind a ticket for illegal parking, Black told The DallasMorning News in an interview published Friday.   Black is the first country male artist in 15 years to have hisdebut single reach the No. 1 spot. His third single, ``Nobody'sHome,'' was released in November.</TEXT><DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chemists B. Stanley Pons and MartinFleischmann, who concocted a controversial cold fusion experimentin a kitchen, are at it again.   This time, the results won't be questioned. Neither will they bethe subject of a new race to harness the power of the sun and stars.   Pons and Fleischmann, who earlier this year rocked thescientific community with claims they'd achieved a sustained fusionreaction in a flask, annually turn their attention from laboratoryresearch to the kitchen.   The menu at their holiday open house this year consisted ofnearly 60 different foods and beverages.   The offerings included tortellini in sausage pesto; antipastomisto; pate with green peppercorns and truffles; and avocado-lemonmousse.   Fleischmann said he looks ``askance at a scientist who doesn'tlike to cook. Chemists, on the whole, take up cooking as a hobby.Some study history or music, but I'd say cooking is the firstchoice.''</TEXT><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The daughter of Mayor Tom Bradley has beencharged with drunken driving and faces up to a year in jail ifconvicted, an official said.
