LABELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bands of youths hurled bombs, burnedcars and trucks, and shouted anti-government slogans Wednesdayduring a general strike called to disrupt Parliamentary elections.At least eight people were injured.   Teen-agers and children, several appearing younger than 10 yearsold, stopped a city garbage truck in downtown Dhaka, smashed itwith clubs and set it ablaze.   ``We set fire to Ershad's throne!'' the youngsters chanted,referring to President Hussain Muhammad Ershad.   Demonstrators stoned and taunted police burned election banners,along with at least one scooter and a taxi.   The opposition called the strike to protest Thursday'sParliamentary elections. Many here believe the elections have morepotential for violence than for halting the stalemate betweenErshad and his foes.   Eight people were reported hospitalized with injuries from smallbombs, and two were in serious condition, police and hospitalofficials said.   But no major confrontations erupted between police andprotestors, and the city was calm overall.   In the southern port city of Chittagong, witnesses said at least50 people were injured in clashes between protestors and police.The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said protestorsthrew bombs at the office of the local municipal corporation anddamaged several vehicles.   In the capital, the strike appeared successful, shutting downshops and businesses and chasing from the streets the bicyclerickshaws that make Dhaka traffic a nightmare.   But the strike appeared to have little effect outside Dhakaother than stopping trucks and buses from running.   It was the 24th strike called by the opposition since Nov. 10,when it began its campaign to oust Ershad.   In a move to compromise with his opponents, Ershad dissolved the330-seat Parliament last December, 3{ years before its term was toexpire, and scheduled new elections. But opposition leaders havesaid no election conducted under Ershad can be fair, and they areurging a voter boycott.   At least 33 people have been died since Nov. 10, either inclashes, by police gunfire, or in campaign-related violence.   Sheik Hasina of the opposition Awami League said Wednesday thatshe expected only 5 percent or 10 percent of the 47.8 millionvoters to cast ballots.   More than 900 candidates from 102 political parties are runningfor Parliament. Eighteen candidates, all from Ershad's JatiyaParty, have already been declared elected for lack of opposition,and voting in one district was canceled because of the slaying of acandidate.   In addition to the Parliamentary election, municipal electionswill be held in the cities of Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, andRajshahi.   In similar polling for town and village councils across thecountry three weeks ago, more than 100 people were killed inbattles between supporters of candidates.   Ershad seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and won electionin 1986. He ordered 9,000 army troops and about 290,000 localpolice and paramilitary troops deployed to ensure security for theelections.</TEXT></DOC>
