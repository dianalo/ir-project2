 People don't sit down and playwith a computer because it's fun to type DOS commands.andP;  They're eitherwriting a proposal or designing a house or playing chess.andP;  They only use acomputer because it helps them be more productive.andP;  It's like using a camerato reproduce a scene.andP;  You could paint a picture, but it's quicker and morerealistic to take a snapshot.andP;  And while single lens reflex cameras have beenaround for a long time, the average American's interest in photography endsat taking photos of his kid's birthday party, which can be done very easilyand satisfactorily with an autofocus camera.andM;Most casual photographers don't want to set f-stops, and most casual computerusers don't want to remember obscure commands.andP;  And the less time a userspends actually telling the computer what to do, the more productive he orshe is likely to be.andP;  The computer should be doing things for you, not theother way around.andM;It seems that the original designers of DOS didn't see it that way, and whocan blame them?andP;  They were designing the Disk Operating System, not theHelpful Interface System.andP;  Their basic purpose was to give users a way--notnecessarily the easiest way--to manipulate a PC's hardware.andM;The situation isn't totally grim, since the limitations in DOS gave birth toa slew of third-party vendors whose sole purpose was to provide applicationsto smooth the course of interaction between users and operating systems.andO;Among the software provided, menu and file front ends are probably the mosthelpful because they understand the way humans think and work.andM;Users don't like being made to feel stupid, but they do need to be told whatto do.andP;  Enter the menu system, which provides users with a list of optionswhen they first turn on their computers.andP;  Users don't have to remember anycommands or program or batch file names.andP;  The menu system will guide themthrough each step quickly and intuitively and deposit them safely within theappropriate application.andM;A file system is slightly more specific than a menu system, though the twoare so closely related many packages include both.andP;  A file manager doesn]texpect the user to know what a file name is or where it's located to retrieveit.andP;  A file manager permits a user to find a file according to author, keywords, dates, or other criteria--anything but the actual DOS file namebecause that's the last thing a user remembers.andP;  A file manager also lets theuser manage documents without having to type endless copy, rename, and deletecommands.andP;  It also regulates access to files.andP;  Users &quot;check out&quot; files as ifthey were borrowing books from a libary.andP;  Between the two, menu systems andfile managers decrease users' busywork, so they can concentrate on the taskat hand.andM;Menu MotherlodeandM;One of DOS's severest drawbacks is its unblinking, uninformative, unfriendlycommand line interface.andP;  It assumes that users know exactly what they wantand that they know how to get it.andP;  Not all users do, and even those relativeexperts quickly tire of typing and retyping the same commands.andM;A good interface makes a huge difference, as the Macintosh designers wereshrewd enough to realize.andP;  The Mac, aside from its self-explanatory graphicalinterface, also made efficient use of menus, presenting users with a list ofoptions instead of expecting them to memorize the commands.andP;  Furthermore,users could choose with one or two keystrokes, or better still click on themwith the mouse, instead of typing long character strings.andM;The complexity of having to remember where applications are and how to startthem may not seem staggering where a standalone system is concerned, but overa network it can be practically impossible.andP;  With a menu system, the networkbecomes transparent to the user.andP;  All he or she has to do is select anaction, and the menu system will do the rest, whether that includes findingthe file, loading application software, changing directories, or logging out.andM;A menu system reduces the sheer tedium of typing commands.andP;  To access aspreadsheet residing on a file server, for example, a user has to log ontothe server, map a local drive to the server, access that drive, change to thedirectory, and type the program name before starting work.andP;  The administratorwho is versed in programming can write a batch file using DOS commands, butmenu systems give you this convenience immediately.andP;  And they give you morefunctionality.andM;A menu system makes the network manager's life simpler.andP;  An administrator candesign one interface for all users, an interface for groups of users, ortailor a menu for each user.andP;  In a good menu system, any changes made tobatch files can be made once, and the system will automatically modify eachone.andP;  An administrator can allow one group of users access to certainapplications, and a second group access to a comletely different set.andM;A menu system also reduces the threat of both malicious and unintentionaltampering with the system since users are presented with a controlled set ofoptions.andP;  And users don't become familiar with cruising through directories,so they are less likely to &quot;explore and discover&quot; information they shouldn'thave.andM;Most menu systems have software metering capabilities, which restrict thenumber of users that can access an application simultaneously.andP;  Instead ofbuying copies of a particular application's software for every network user,you can buy only a few, and the software meter then ensures that only thatnumber of users load the software.andM;Another boon to the average administrator is usage tracking.andP;  A good menusystem tracks the use of each application, letting the administrator knowwho's using a certain program and for how long.andP;  Users can be required tofill out usage forms before entering an application, including a projectcode.andP;  The information is useful both in billing and in determining when userlicenses need to be added for certain applications.andM;Finally, most menu systems have nifty utilities like calculators, clocks, andcalendars that can be included as options on a menu.andM;Document DifficultiesandM;SolvedandM;A user who needs to manage files over a network with DOS alone is adrift in abarren landscape.andP;  No information is readily available about where files arelocated, what they're called, who wrote them, how large they are, and whenthey were last modified.andP;  The network itself is obscured behind the unfeelingF:andgt; prompt.andP;  A user has no idea which drives can be accessed nor whatdirectories and subdirectories reside on those drives.andP;  The job is difficultenough for a user managing his or her own files.andP;  A network manager has todeal not only with the vagaries of DOS, but with those of irresponsible andforgetful users as well.andM;A file manager overcomes the limitations of DOS and adds functionality aswell.andP;  Users can retrieve files based on information both about and withinit.andP;  File management systems keep databases of files and their attributes, sousers can specify a title, author, size, or even date created, and the systemwill return the appropriate file or group of files.andP;  Once a user has selecteda file, most packages will also load the application software used to createit, although the user always has the option simply to view the contents.andM;As with menu systems, file systems also provide file tracking, a nearlyinvaluable feature once you're used to it.andP;  A system can keep track of when afile was accessed and by whom.andP;  It can also keep track of different versionsand revisions of the same file and even archive a file when users are throughwith it or specified time has elapsed.andM;File management systems also build directory trees of all the various driveson the network, so users can browse through the available files on allnetworked drives.andP;  Most packages build varying levels of security into thesystem, so users are only shown drives and directories that they can access.andO;Authorized users can also change file attributes, making them hidden orunhidden.andM;Menu systems are more widely applicable than file managers.andP;  Whereas almostany user's life can be simplified by a menu, companies that produce a hugenumber of files would find document managers most useful.andP;  For example, lawfirms use file managers to organize the huge number of documents created foreach client.andP;  And they use the software to restrict access to these files toonly authorized users.andP;  Similarly, publishing companies can use this softwareto track revisions to articles.andP;  File managers are gaining a new marketthrough the increased use of optical disks.andP;  More than ever, it is criticalto be able to catalogue files by criteria other than the DOS file name.andM;The PlayersandM;Some menu systems have so much functionality built in they cross the lineinto the network front end category.andP;  The distinction is that a network frontend insulates users from all aspects of a network, from the command line tosecurity issues to printers.andP;  Among these are International Computer Group'sPerfect Menu, Saber Software's Saber Menu, and Automated Design's WindowsWorkstation.andM;Automated Design Systems (Atlanta, Ga.) brings custom menus, security andmessaging capability to PCs running Microsoft Windows on a network.andP;  WindowsMenu includes the Windows Menu Editor, Secure Station, and Windows Intercommodules.andM;The system allows for an unlimited number of menus and sub-menus to bedesigned both for individuals and groups of users.andP;  The menus can beassembled using a mouse or keyboard, and every aspect of the appearance canbe determined by the administrator.andP;  Because the process is interactive,menus can be tested while being created or edited.andP;  Users can run and loadmultiple programs, change directories and pass environment variables from asingle command.andP;  Menu system defaults can be set for all LAN users, andcontext-sensitive, cutomizable help is also available.andM;Passwords can be added to any program or sub-menu, and there is a setpassword to exit the menu system.andP;  Secure Station also allows the user tolock the workstation and blank the screen, and requires a password before itwill relinquish control to the user.andP;  The system also provides fileencryption and decryption.andP;  The Intercom modules allows messages to be sentto and from one or more users from within any Windows application.andP;  Users canreply to messages they've received with a single keystroke.andP;  The package is$595 for 10 users.andM;While some menus have evolved into a network front end, plenty of simplemenus still exist.andP;  These less-featured but functional menu systems provide arespite from the cold world of DOS and networks.andM;Le Menu from Bartel Software (Midvale, Utah) provides users with 26 menuchoices and five levels of submenus.andP;  The program uses a scant 1K of memoryand allows users to define menu parameters.andP;  Managers can define four typesof menu choices: program, batch file, sub-menu, or DOS services.andP;  Each userhas a unique assigned name, and the system won't let two users with identicallogin names onto the network at once.andP;  When viewed from a security point ofview, this is a convenience.andP;  From a flexibility point of view, this isnuisance.andP;  Le Menu also tracks every user that logs onto the network.andP;  Thesystem administrator can also require that users enter project codes beforeentering an application.andM;Options available under DOS Services mimic those available with most filemanagers, although accessing them can be somewhat less intuitive.andP;  TheDirectory Management option displays directory trees and lets users log todisks, create and manipulate directories, and encrypt and view a file.andM;Le Menu also provides utilities specifically for NetWare, which allow usersto log in and out, attach to various servers, turn the print spooler on andoff, display and edit the print queue, list directory rights and currentusers, and send a message.andM;The menu system available with Pennington, N.J.-based Applied AutomatedEngineering Corporation's (AAEC) Productivity Tools allows up to five choicesper menu, with 10 levels of sub-menus.andP;  The administrator can customize menusfor an individual user or groups of users.andP;  If you choose the memory-residentversion, Productivity Tools will need 16K of RAM.andP;  Context-sensitive help isavailable at all levels.andM;The file management module allows users to change file, directory, andsub-directory attributes.andP;  Directories can be sorted by name, extension,attribute, creation date and time, or size.andP;  Files can also be located, evenif the user doesn't know the exact path.andP;  Users can delete and undeletefiles, as well as erase an entire disk.andP;  At $99, the package is a good choicefor users who need the extra ease and flexibility of a menu system withoutthe extensive capabilities of more robust and more expensive packages.andM;SuperMenu from Klondike Software (Ottawa, Ont.andP;  Canada) is for PCs on LANsrunning either the multiuser QNX from Quantum Software Systems or plain oldDOS.andP;  Options are displayed in overlapping windows or pulldown menus.andO;Windows can be configured with respect to size, color, and placement.andP;  The30K package will remove itself from memory when the user runs anotherapplication.andP;  SuperMenu is controlled from an ASCII script file, with tasksdescribed in terms of QNX or DOS commands with macro variables.andP;  SuperMenu ispriced at $295 for a 10-node network and $595 for an unlimited number ofusers.andM;The DocumentersandM;Document managers come in as many versions as menu systems.andM;LANFolio from Network Management/LANware (New York, N.Y.) is designed arounda Structured Query Language (SQL) database engine.andP;  Users only need to know aminimal amount of information about a document, and LANfolio will find thefile, whether that file resides on a different volume, a different fileserver, or another network than the user.andM;LANfolio uses a unique three-tiered structure.andP;  The Workstation module allowsusers to request and manipulate documents.andP;  The Document Request Server sitsbetween the Workstation and the SQL Database Server, and it is this componentthat permits LANfolio to operate with an unlimited number of users.andP;  Thispiece is also essential to LANfolio's successful operation in a wide areanetwork.andP;  The SQL database engine is the actual repository of fileinformation.andP;  Multiple request servers and database servers may exist on thenetwork.andM;Audit trails are kept so a client can be charged back for the amount of timepeople spend working on documents.andP;  LANfolio can archive old documents totape or optical disk.andP;  New documents may enter the system throughconventional methods or hightech ways, such as scanners.andM;Another sophisticated document manager is FileShare from Saros (Bellevue,Wash.).andP;  FileShare runs on an OS/2 file server and supports DOS workstationsand implements Windows' graphical user interface.andM;A file created using any PC application is entered into FileShare and storedaccording to a predefined file category.andP;  A profile is then created with upto 46 attributes, such as title, author, document type, plus any number ofkey words.andP;  The system administrator specifies where the file will be stored.andM;A file can be accessed by any authorized user with concurrent accesscontrolled by the system.andP;  New versions of the file are tracked, and oldversions are either archived or erased.andP;  An API for developers is available.andO;Pricing starts at $425.andM;NetAdvantage is a new document and file manager for NetWare from InterNetSoftware (Madison, Wisc.).andP;  Designed around a multiuser database called theDocuBase, NetAdvantage lets users retrieve files by author, client, oroperator names, or any other field in the database.andP;  The file control systemtracks file activity, providing an administrator with status, billing, andaudit trail information.andM;Users can view files either by directory or in folders, which can containdifferent types of files from different directories.andP;  For documents with longand varied life cycles, NetAdvantage can also track different versions andrevisions of a file.andM;NetAdvantage will display a graphical directory tree specific to each user,displaying only those directories to which the user has access.andP;  Copying,renaming, and deleting files can be done quickly, and files can be archived.andO;To eliminate duplicate file names, NetAdvantage automatically assigns filenames, always allowing users to provide a list of valid file name templates.andM;NetAdvantage allows users to generate their own applications menu to accessprograms and batch files quickly.andP;  The system also contains commands to letusers send messages over a network, list drive mappings, change passwords,and list users.andP;  Pricing has not yet been set for NetAdvantage, which will beavailable in the second quarter.andM;WorkGroup, originally LANScape, from NCompass Software (New York, N.Y.), wasone of the first document managers for networks.andP;  Like the others, WorkGroupallows users to select files according to attributes.andP;  Once a user has chosena file, WorkGroup loads the file within the appropriate application.andP;  Or theuser may simply view the file.andP;  It automatically assigns DOS file names,drives, and subdirectories and archives old documents.andM;Version 1.5 includes dynamic multiserver, multivolume linking, which allowstransparent storage of files across multiple servers.andP;  With the round-robindistributed server capability, the 100-user-per-network limit of NetWare canbe exceeded to support up to 4,000 users per network.andP;  There is a facilitythat permits users to select private or shared storage locations.andM;Additional enhancements include attaching documents to transport packagessuch as e-mail and mainframe gateways.andP;  Local document and program supportprovide access to those files and applications on users' local drives.andO;WorkGroup sells for $995.andM;The Document Manager from Syntrex (Eatontown, N.J.) is the only filemanagement system for Banyan Vines networks.andP;  Users can search on any one ora combination of attributes and then view the results of the search on anindividual document basis.andP;  The Document Manager with Syntrex's own menuinterface costs $495 per server.andP;  The version that is integrated to workunder DESQview costs $1,495 per server.andM;Network Windows from Distinct (Saratoga, Calif.) is a family of Windows-basedapplications that can share files and resources across an NFS network.andP;  Partof this suite of products is Network File Manager, which permits differentoperating systems, such as DOS or UNIX, to become invisible to users.andP;  Usershave to learn how to interact with only one consistent interface.andM;Menus and ManagersandM;The distinction between menus and file managers blurs at the high end of oneand the low end of the other.andP;  Understandably, several vendors sell both.andM;ReferencePoint from LANSystems (New York, N.Y.) handles files created by allkinds of applications.andP;  ReferencePoint shares the distinction with NCompass'WorkGroup of being one of the original document managers.andP;  WithReferencePoint, files are automatically named and organized according toproject.andP;  Once a user requests a file, ReferencePoint will automatically loadthe appropriate application software.andP;  Files that have been accessed by oneuser are available to other users on a read-only basis.andM;LANSystem's LANShell lets users access programs, commands, and proceduresthrough menu choices that can be customized by the LAN administrator.andO;Different menus can be created for different users or groups and can remainconsistent over different network operating systems.andP;  LANShell also supportssoftware metering.andP;  ReferencePoint sells for $495 per five users.andP;  LANShellis priced at $495 for a single-server, unlimited site license.andM;Circle Development (Memphis, Tenn.) recently overhauled its menu system anddocument manager.andP;  LanMenu is written in Clipper-complied dBase.andP;  Theupgraded LanMenu will support 999 options per menu and an unlimited number ofsublevels.andP;  Each menu item can open a submenu, call an internal subroutine,shell to another program, or execute a batch file with no memory overhead.andM;Access to each option can be controlled through user ID.andP;  LanMenu alsoprovides software metering.andP;  Other enhancements include utilities such as anotebook, calendar, alarm clock, and adding machine.andP;  The basic LanMenupackage is priced at $85 and includes the menu system and maintenanceprograms.andP;  The source code costs $395.andP;  For $2,000, a user can purchase theentire package with source code.andM;Document! is Circle's file management program for wary and weary users ofWordPerfect.andP;  Document! costs $150 for 50 users.andM;AperitifandM;For reviews of Saber Menu, Amtec's Menu, and Perfect Menu, please turn to ourTest Drive section.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
