ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A West German political party is asking tojoin in legal actions to delay the launch of Atlantis, hoping togain time to get the issue of the space shuttle's nuclear cargobefore the world court.   ``Because of the shortness of time, they asked that we representthem,'' said Lanny Sinkin, a lawyer for the Christic Institute _one of three environmental groups that on Tuesday lost an attemptto get a temporary restraining order against the launch.   Atlantis is to be launched next week with the nuclear-poweredGalileo space probe in its cargo bay. After release from theshuttle, Galileo is to embark on a six-year journey to the planetJupiter.   The U.S. environmental groups had asked that the launch behalted on grounds that NASA had not fulfilled its environmentalrequirements and that an accident could poison the atmosphere withdeadly plutonium-238. The petition by the Green Party, delivered toSinkin in the midst of the hearing, cites possible violation of aninternational treaty.   ``They were asking for a 10-day temporary restraining order sothey could determine whether to go to the World Court, or whetherto approach the German government to intervene formally,'' Sinkinsaid. He said it is his understanding that only a government canenforce a treaty.   The Green Party is a political party focused on environmentalissues and has some seats in the West German Parliament.   ``Their claim is a violation of the outer space treaty signed in1967 that both Germany and the United States have ratified,''Sinkin said. ``One provision says activities in space explorationby one country will not harm activities of another country. Theyare concerned about the potential for plutonium contamination ofGermany.''   The signatories to the treaty also agreed not to introduceharmful contaminants into space and ``there is concern about thepotential of introducing both plutonium and biological life intoJupiter's atmosphere because Galileo is not sterilized,'' Sinkinsaid.   The U.S. environmental groups have said they intend to carrytheir fight against the launch to higher courts, but no furtherlegal actions had been filed.   The newspaper Florida Today first reported the Germans' attemptto intervene. The motion to join in the suit was filed on behalf ofthe Green Party by Helmut Lippelt, secretary to the lower house ofWest Germany's Parliament.   ``As graphically demonstrated to the people of Germany by theChernobyl accident, such releases (of plutonium) can drasticallyaffect people situated far from the site of the accident,'' theGreens' court motion says.   ``The amount of plutonium on the Galileo mission exceeds theinventory of radioactivity in the Chernobyl reactor at the time ofthe accident,'' it said.   NASA attorney Edward Frankle said the government will counteradditional legal maneuvers.   ``Any further attempts to get an injunction or change thecurrent status, we will object to,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
