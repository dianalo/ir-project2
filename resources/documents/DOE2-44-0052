<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-44-0052 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the high voltage dc transmission power station in a block circuit,a three-phase generator feeds a 12-pulse high voltage dc transmissionshort coupler through at least one shifting transformer which servesfor forming voltages of two three-phase voltage systems phase-shiftedrelative to each other by 30/sup 0/. As compared to a full transformer,the shifting transformer can be constructed for substantially less power,which reduces the cost and the losses of the station. While the voltagesof the two phase-shifted voltage systems can be taken off at the externalterminals of the secondary windings of the shifting transformer, thecenter taps of the secondary windings are acted upon by the generatorvoltage. Advantageously, the high voltage dc transmission short coupleris formed of a multiplicity of parallel, electrically separate dc circuitswhich can be fed by separate shifting transformers.</TEXT></DOC>
