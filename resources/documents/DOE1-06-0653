The link transmitter is connected to the controlcircuitry and is kept at ground potential. The link receiver/modulatoris battery operated and attached to a piezoelectric valve located onthe ion source, all of which can be biased up to 5 kV. Feedback signalssent via the link control the valve so that constant pressure in theion source is maintained. The link is simple, compact, and enhances ionsource stability and ease of operation. 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
