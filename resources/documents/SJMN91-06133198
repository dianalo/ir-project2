Umberto Eco holds no secrets for you;neither do Georges Perec, Arno Schmidt and Joseph McElroy. But now, you askexpectantly, where are the fresh woods and pastures new of fiction, thewriters worthy of your steel, the novels that you go into training for?;    Heroic reader, &quot;Larva&quot; is the book for you.;    It's got everything. It'stranslated -- from Spanish -- and nearly every other word is a pun. There arefive different &quot;planes&quot; of text: narrative on the right-hand page; footnoteson the left; explicatory &quot;pillow notes&quot; at the back; an index; and a set ofphotographs. And, best of all, it's only the first installment of five heftyvolumes. When you've finished &quot;Larva,&quot; you can congratulate yourself on yourstamina and then look forward to &quot;Poundemonium,&quot; &quot;Auto de Fenix&quot; and twoothers as yet unwritten.;    Such as it is, the main action of this tower ofbabble describes a phantasmagoric party held in London on midsummer's night.All the characters are masked or costumed; Don Juan is a principal figure,with guest appearances by harlequins, nuns, odalisques, amazons and figuresout of the Arabian Nights and Lewis Carroll. Periodically interrupting thisgaudy spectacle, the book's &quot;pillow notes&quot; relate the adventures, most of themerotic, of Milalias (a thousand aliases), his beloved Babelle, his Belgianpoet-friend Rimbaudelaire and their mentor X. Reis. Neither of these two plotlines provides much narrative excitement beyond that of mild sexualtitillation.;    No, where &quot;Larva&quot; cracks open and takes wing is in itslanguage, a kaleidoscopic display of linguistic excess that, like &quot;FinnegansWake,&quot; starts with &quot;the abnihilisation of the etym&quot; and then turns the King'sEnglish into a &quot;kinks English&quot; of puns, palindromes, acronyms and unrulygarrulity. Imagine, again in Joyce's words, a crossmess parzel of plurabelleprose, a real mess of mottage.;    Much of &quot;Larva&quot; seems quite daunting, but areader quickly picks up the knack of detecting and enjoying Rios' multiplemeanings. The best ones are often the simplest. &quot;To each his onus.&quot; &quot;Enemasand frenzies, I mean friends and enemies.&quot; &quot;Quit your socrastination.&quot; &quot;Don'tcount your chicks before they're laid.&quot;;    Rios, who's been working on&quot;Larva&quot; and its successors for more than 15 years, loves every form oflinguistic playfulness. Anagrams, such as &quot;Silence gives license,&quot; sneak inrepeatedly. A note on LSD says &quot;Lysergic acid reinforces veiled arcana,&quot; whichis a true-enough observation, but one whose initial letters also spell outlarva. Sometimes Rios goes for pure sound effect: A porno movie maker&quot;screened his keen teen epicene dream to be seen in reams of obscene scenes.&quot;Allusions, literary and otherwise, abound: to undervalued writers like JulesRenard and the minnesinger Heinrich von Ofterdingen, to pop songs (&quot;Help me,Rondo&quot;), to Mr. Joyce from Dublin and Dr. Freud from Doblin.;    Behind allthis, of course, is Herr Narrator, &quot;a sort of ventriloquacious nut whomisproduces our voices . . . a cunning conning cofounder and confounder.&quot;Behind him, in turn, is Rios, in back of whom are the astonishingly adepttranslators Richard Alan Francis and Suzanne Jill Levine -- how did they evermanage to anglicize a daunting Spanish original?;    Nonetheless, behind orbefore them all stand the readers who, by seeking the meanings in the book'sextremes, become equal partners in its textual intercourse. Quiteappropriately, the infinity sign becomes a key symbol in &quot;Larva,&quot; along withthe four-leaf clover. Rios readers can use all the luck they can get.;   Still, for all its oohs and awesome fireworks, Larva exemplifies associativewordplay more often than the true etymic fusion of &quot;Finnegans Wake.&quot; No doubtmuch is lost in even the most dazzling, dizzying translation, but in Englishthe novel seems more an ingenious work than a work of genius. For some people,of course, it will hardly seem literature at all, more a sport of recreationallinguistics.;    More pun-churner than page-turner then, &quot;Larva&quot; nonethelessshows off the whirl within the word and reminds us that language can aim to beother than a transparent window, that one can sometimes have more gain withless pane. Painterly impressionism, incantation, musicality, rococo arabesque,multiple signification, sheer enchantment -- these are Dionysiac qualitiessuppressed by the classical virtues of clear, efficient prose. A stern,schoolmasterly Samuel Johnson advised writers to give over their days andnights to the study of Addison; Julian Rios, by contrast, rings the bell forrecess and sends everyone, pushing and shoving, out to play.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MICHAEL DIRDA  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910512  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  18  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  808  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday May 12, 199100133198,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
