The oil company said the discovery well, Bhangali-1, tested at a rate of 3,110 barrels of oil and 7.2 million cubic feet of natural gas a day, ranging in depth from 12,024 feet to 12,339 feet. The tests were conducted through a 28/64-inch choke. Flowing tubing pressure was 3,720 pounds per square inch absolute. Oil gravity was 32 degrees on the American Petroleum Institute scale.    A spokesman said the discovery well is located 30 miles from the Dhurnal field, whose 19,000 barrels of oil and 40 million cubic feet of natural gas a day make it the largest-producing field in Pakistan. The company is hopeful that the new well, when fully developed, will be larger than the Dhurnal field. Occidental has a 76% interest in the discovery well and a 45% working interest in the Dhurnal field. </TEXT></DOC>
