They accused Interior Secretary Donald Hodel of ``crying wolf''over supposed energy shortages in order to press for large-scaleoil and gas development of Alaskan wilderness and environmentallysensitive areas off the shores of California and New England.   ``Future generations of Americans may lose priceless nationalenvironmental resources,'' said the report, which was prepared bythe Sierra club and endorsed by two other groups, Friends of theEarth and the National Audubon Society.   It said the United States could lead the world in boostingenergy efficiency and developing renewable energy sources such assolar power.   ``The alternative offered by the Reagan administration is notjust an environmental tragedy, but an energy disaster,'' the groupssaid.   Brooks B. Yeager, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club and author ofthe report, told a press briefing the administration ``has opposed,obstructed and undermined virtually every congressional attempt toencourage greater energy efficiency or the development of renewableresources.''   ``This presidential election year and the coming change to a newadministration offers us a great opportunity to refocus our sightson achievable national energy goals which will significantlyimprove our overall energy security,'' he said.   Yeager praised Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis'interest in ``energy efficiency alternatives'' and his oppositionto oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refugeand off northern California.   He said Republican candidate George Bush ``has not fundamentallyoffered a new vision of energy policy. The Republican platform andVice President Bush's statements seem to indicate business asusual.''   The report called Hodel's energy planning record disastrous,saying he ``has used the prospect of impending energy shortages topromote massive energy development schemes'' throughout his career.   An Interior Department spokesman, David Prosperi, commentedabout the Sierra Club report: ``From all appearances it's nothingmore than a lot of hot air.''   ``It's ironic that these individuals who accuse Secretary Hodelof crying wolf are the same ones who screamed that oil prices wouldgo through the ceiling when President Reagan deregulated the priceof oil. And they were the same doom sayers who predicted the demiseof the caribou herd in (Alaska's) Prudhoe Bay because of energyactivity, when in fact the caribou herd has tripled in number,''Prosperi said.   Yeager said the 3.2-billion-barrel reservoir of oil said tounderlie the Arctic coastal plain ``is dwarfed by the billions ofbarrels of oil remaining in already exploited domestic oilreservoirs.''   ``We need to encourage infill drilling and enhanced recoverytechniques so that we can develop this resource,'' he said.   And raising new car and light truck average efficiency standardsfrom the current 26 miles per gallon to 40 mpg would save more than30 billion barrels of oil, Yeager said.   ``The potential for American development of both passive andactive solar energy has hardly begun to be tapped,'' he added.``Other countries, including Japan, are making a more seriouseffort to develop this technology.''</TEXT></DOC>
