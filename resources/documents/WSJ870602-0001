The Senate Labor Committee has approved, and a House panel will consider, bills that would require employers to give six months advance notice of plant closings or layoffs affecting 500 or more workers. Less warning would be required for cutbacks covering at least 50 employees.    Caterpillar Inc. says it generally gives a year or more notice of closings. Layoffs, though, are another matter. &quot;We would have to delay any change in production schedules or else have people sitting around doing nothing,&quot; a spokesman says. But a United Auto Workers official says that advance notice is possible for major layoffs. &quot;The only reason companies don't want to announce it is it may hurt their stock price,&quot; he contends.    Some unionists say their major headaches are smaller companies that don't match the lead times of the giants.    SELF-FUNDING: Many companies try it for health benefits.    Fully 46% of the corporations surveyed by consultant Johnson andamp; Higgins say they're shunning conventional medical insurance for some or all of the health claims submitted by employees. Instead, they pick up the tab themselves. Self-funding, they find, can save costs by eliminating some taxes and avoiding state-imposed coverage requirements. The companies, moreover, get to use the money until claims are paid.    Self-funding can be a huge risk. But few companies are going &quot;naked.&quot; Most buy stop-loss coverage from insurance carriers to take over whenever an individual's claim tops a specified limit, say $50,000, or when all claims exceed the company's forecast by a specified amount. This coverage lets a company select &quot;as wide or narrow&quot; a risk as it wants, Johnson andamp; Higgins says.    WAGES FOLLOW PROFITS far more than in the past, an economist finds.    In the 1950s to mid-1960s, says Richard Belous of the Conference Board, there was little correlation between corporate earnings and changes in hourly pay. In those days, industry norms held bigger sway than profit in setting wage rates. Where +1.0 would be a perfect link, the correlation then was a bare +0.15. In 1966 through 1979, the correlation increased to a moderate +0.47.    Since 1980, however, profit has started to rule, with the tie running a &quot;strong positive correlation&quot; of +0.64, Mr. Belous says. This link-and the resultant labor-market flexibility-&quot;can help managers reduce unit labor costs and improve productivity as pay becomes more tied to performance,&quot; he says. But he allows it also &quot;can increase insecurity and foster some resentments among both workers and managers.&quot;    Even with the grumbling, though, profit will continue to play an ever larger role in pay scales, he predicts.    FORGET STOCK OPTIONS: With last year's tax rewrite and proposed accounting changes, 73% of the major companies that have made a decision about incentive stock options have decided to eliminate them or substantially reduce eligibility, says consultant Sibson andamp; Co.    MALE WORKERS resist having women as mentors or proteges, says Timothy Hall of Boston University School of Management. Young men, he explains, prefer male mentors because they think men have the power. And some would-be mentors and proteges are discomforted by the &quot;sexual innuendoes&quot; of working so closely with the other sex, says Kathy Kram, also of BU.    FLEXTIME GROWS: Nearly one-third of the businesses surveyed by the Administrative Management Society let workers help decide their own work schedules. That's double the percentage of a decade ago.    CORPORATE DOWNSIZING has hidden risks for survivors, suggests Jerome Rosow, president of Work in America Institute, a research group. Among them: new duties without experience, fewer supervisors to cushion problems and heightened expectations with less direction from on high. And if you do well, where can you be promoted?    COLLEGIANS SCAMPER for summer jobs to meet rising tuition costs.    To help meet $6,000 in expected bills for the next school year, Joseph Sanfilippo, a UCLA engineering senior, has lined up two jobs. He has an engineering internship, and he's building elevated dorm beds on the side. Some University of Houston students are submitting to a barrage of interviews by corporate personnel trainees, for $35 to $50 an hour and a chance to sharpen their own interviewing skills.    While many students are trying to use the summer to further their careers, some view the school break as a time to earn money and enjoy some sun and fun, too. Robert Cangelosi, a first-year law student at the University of South Carolina, will be tending grounds at a New York country club. Laura Stevens, a University of Texas junior, is working as a cocktail waitress. It's the only job available, she says, that &quot;pays well and doesn't take real skill.&quot;    And there are always fast-food jobs. Taco Bell, for one, is actively recruiting college students in the Southwest.    THE CHECKOFF: Almost three-quarters of the CEOs of financial-service companies don't think new MBAs are worth the big salaries they command in the financial industry, recruiter Heidrick andamp; Struggles says. . . . Humboldt State University graduates, with their degrees, are asked to sign a &quot;pledge to thoroughly investigate and take into account the social and environmental consequences of any job opportunity I consider.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
