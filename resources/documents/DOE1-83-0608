The dominant feature in the thermal chemistry of 8-hydroxyquinolineis that it readily undergoes redox and chelation chemistry with metalsand metal oxides, especially at the elevated temperatures normally employedin heavy hydrocarbon conversion processing. Characterization of the thermallygenerated chelates revealed that extensive condensation of the organicligands also occurred. The formation of chelates with 8-hydroxyquinolinemay provide a model for the fate of some metallic species, both thosefrom reactor walls and those inherent in the feed (especially heavy oilsand residua), during hydroprocessing. One important implication of thiswork is that reactor corrosion can be enhanced if substantial amountsof amphoteric, chelating moieties are present in a feed. Additionally,it is noted that the presence of hydrogen suppresses this chelation chemistry.9 refs., 4 figs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
