As a result of the sale, which completes a restructuring program of selling energy-related and capital-intensive businesses, Hinderliter said it expects to report a gain of more than $2 million for its second quarter ended Wednesday. Combined with other asset sales, the company expects to have a gain of more than $6 million for the quarter, which Hinderliter said will be profitable.    In the year-earlier second quarter, the company had a net loss of $4.9 million, including a loss from continuing operations of $2.1 million.    Hinderliter also said it has reduced its debt to about $15 million from about $24 million a year ago.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company. </TEXT></DOC>
