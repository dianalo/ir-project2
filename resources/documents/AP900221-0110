Reynolds lobbed an easy pitch over theplate, Louis W. Sullivan, the secretary of health and humanservices, knocked it outta here.   The secretary has been benched for some contests the White Housedoes not want any part of, for instance, family planning. But hehas been a tiger on tobacco: Within 24 hours of blasting Reynoldsfor planning to test-market a cigarette called Uptown inPhiladelphia, the company dumped the test.   It does tend to mess up a test-marketing effort if the secretaryof health and human services says your product is fostering a``culture of cancer'' among the target group _ young blacks, inthis particular case. ...   Sullivan knew it and Reynolds knew it, so that was that.   That brings us to the next inning in this business. The fellasat Reynolds are planning yet another limited rollout of a newproduct. This time the test market is Houston, where the target iswomen aged 18 to 20, one of the few segments of the U.S. marketwhere smoking is still on the upswing.   Well, we could have told Reynolds what would happen. ... Wesuppose it's silly to expect a company that's burying folks asoften as Reynolds is to fully appreciate the term ``decentinterval.'' ...   But give the White House points for unleashing the secretary.Having hit a home run with his efforts to protect young blacks, heis apt to rip the cover off given the chance to defend motherhood.   You'd have thought the geniuses in the Reynolds promotiondepartment would have considered that.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 19   The Milwaukee Journal on baseball arbitration:   Baseball owners have done to spring training what Buster Douglasdid to Mike Tyson. But, while Douglas' boxing victory was notimmediately recognized, there is no doubt that spring training _and the spirit of winter-weary baseball fans _ has taken it on thechin. Eventually, Tyson got up off the floor. Maybe there's a wayto revive spring training, too.   The owners and players are sparring over _ what else? _ money.The main issue is the complex process by which disputes over playersalaries are resolved. Because they couldn't reach an agreementwith the players, the owners have refused to allow spring trainingcamps to open. As a result, February is even more bleak than usual.   Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent is trying to mediate thisdispute, but his efforts seem as futile as they are well-intended.This disagreement seems too tough to yield to ordinary negotiation.The financial stakes are too large _ it is not unheard of forjourneyman ballplayers to be paid $1 million a year _ and thedifferences are too wide.   It is time to submit this dispute to binding arbitration. Notonly are the two sides deadlocked; time is short. Unless thisdispute ends by mid-March, the regular major league baseballseason, set to begin in early April, may have to be delayed. Thatwould cost real money and deprive baseball-hungry fans of gamesthey have waited a long winter to see.   Because of the nature of this dispute, the arbitrator would haveto be a person of unquestioned ability. Such a person will not befound easily or quickly. That's another reason that the searchought to start now.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 22.   Charleston (W. Va.) Daily Mail on coal strike settlement:   The means of reaching the agreement were ugly, but everyone inAppalachia must be happy with the new contract between the UnitedMine Workers and the Pittston Co.   The contract seems to ba a model of negotiation. The union gotwhat it wanted most and company managers got what they wanted most.   For union members, this means fully funded medical and pensionbenefits, improved safety requirements, single-employer status andwage increases that over a three-year period will be 15 cents anhour higher than the industry average.   For company managers, this means flexibility in work schedulesand a reduction in the amount of money it contributes to the 1950pension fund.   As for the general public, this contract agreement means an endto the violence and the reopening of all public highways. That'snot much, but that's about as well as innocent bystanders usuallyfare in these deals.   Was it worth it? Pittston's profits fell $63 million last yearto less than $4 million. The 1,700 strikers went without paychecksfor 10 months _ losses they will never recoup. West Virginia lostwhatever claim it had to being a safe place to do business. Thepublic footed the bill of sending troopers and U.S. marshals to thecoalfields.   But perhaps everyone has learned something, and the hope is thatfuture negotiations will be less violent _ and less costly both tothe participants and the spectators.</TEXT><HEAD>End Editorial Rdp</HEAD></DOC>
