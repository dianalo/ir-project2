The present, however, has muscledin. The peasant is vanishing from the French scene with small farmsdisappearing at a dramatic rate.</TEXT><BYLINE>By MORT ROSENBLUM</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><TEXT>   CUGES-LES-PINS, France (AP) _ In the hills where Jean deFlorette struggled to raise rabbit food, farming is now smallpotatoes. The major local asset is a theme park called ``O.K.Corral.''   This cobblestoned town in Provence, where people still rememberwhat Victor Hugo had for lunch on a stagecoach stop, is whereClaude Berry made two films about peasants from the pages of MarcelPagnol.   But the sort of taciturn, hardscrabble peasants portrayed in``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon des Sources'' are already history.   ``Of the thousand or so residents in Cuges, two, maybe threepeasants remain,'' says Vice Mayor Giles Aicardi, who defines apeasant as one who survives only by what he grows and sells.   Cuges reflects a crisis in Western Europe, and especiallyFrance. There is too much food. And big producers, who track theirsubsidies on computers, are pushing small farms out of existence.   Seven percent of French workers are farmers, three times thelevel of West Germany or Britain. But more than half are over 50.And 50 percent of that group has no heirs expected to stay on theland.   The problem is partly social. Spurred by television, with goodroads into town, many young Frenchmen reject country life. It is amatter of keeping them down on the farm after they've seen Paris.   But few of those who want to stay have the choice.   ``My kids are not in this business,'' says Yves Cornille, 50,one of Cuges' last peasants. ``That was my decision. It is awonderful life, independent, not too hard. You just can't survive.''   Cornille, with pressed slacks and a new Renault, is no Pagnolpeasant. ``Oh, life has changed since then,'' he laughs.   ``Once you could make it with 250 acres'' he says. ``Now youneed 2,500. If I were 25 or 30, I'd quit tomorrow.''   Many, like Cornille, fault the European Economic Community foropening borders among its 12 members and applying complex subsidiesand quotas. In 1992, borders are to open yet wider.   The Common Market, set up first for iron and steel, threatens tocollapse over beef and butter. Two-thirds of its budget goes tosubsidize or store food and wine, much of which goes to waste.   European governments reject American urgings to end farmsubsidies, citing a duty to preserve ways of life dating back 2,000years. But they also discourage production they cannot sell.   Cornille grows wine grapes, more lucrative than food crops.Modern farmers stick with a single crop, or just a few. Theirwives, instead of churning butter or putting up jam, look for jobs.   At the O.K. Corral, a version of Le Far West done with amplepoetic license, a son of peasants swaggered down a dusty street.Asked his name, he replied in Maurice-Chevalier English, ``Bronco.''   Far to the west, the town of Ampus plans to use 500 acres offarmland for a space research center and country club, withlaboratories and an old-style bistro set inside giant golf balls.   ``Like so many places, we can no longer live by agriculture,''says Mayor Roger Casanova, a geology professor in Nice, an houraway. ``We must find other ways to make our community viable.''   Casanova has found Norwegian-Lebanese interests to invest partof the $40 million needed for a 27-hole golf course around afuturistic campus, designed to attract a range of thinkers.   Young people will learn the techniques of space research,aeronautics, advanced computer sciences and environmental science,he says. ``Half the town thinks I'm loony,'' he says.   Rene Aicard, 32, is sticking to farming. He squeaks by on his150 acres, raising strawberries, potatoes, lettuce and rapeseed foroil. His wife, Denise, hauls it to market in a battered little van.   ``It's so sad,'' says Denise, shaking her head. ``Farming is themost beautiful profession in the world, and you work the hardest.But it just doesn't pay anymore.''   In Paris, Yves Van Haecke, chief adviser to the Ministry ofAgriculture, acknowledged that the government had an uphill fightto encourage young people to hold onto family farms.   ``The drop has become dramatic in the last 10 years,'' he says.``Farms disappear now at a rate of 3 percent a year, and the rateis increasing. No question, they're on their way out.''   As small farms go, hundreds of rural communities alter theircenturies-old character.   Ampus is not changing fast. The cubbyhole newspaper-dry goodsstore displays a tattered advertising poster on the door:``Canadian Rat Poison. Their Last Supper.''   A clutch of old men in cloth caps by the fountain seem not tohave moved since the last king clattered by in a carriage.   In Cuges, on a wide road to Marseille, stylish hairdressers andshops full of electronic gadgets have replaced blacksmiths andcracker-barrel grocers.   ``There is plenty of the closed peasant mentality left,'' saysAndree Chikitou, who decided against putting up a sign in herrestaurant saying, ``The Jean de Florette cast ate here.''   With only three years in residence, she found parking tickets onher car if she left it on the little plaza outside. Hometown peopleparked with impunity.   Still, she says, it was better than the last small French townshe lived in. She recalls:   ``One day the butcher woman said, `Well, you've been here 10years, you sort of belong. I'll tell you what happened thismorning.'''   But Martin Santoro, the aging town priest who played the priestin the films, sees Pagnol's France as having evaporated. ``They'renot interested in that way any more,'' he says. ``Kids areleaving.''   Berry wanted to film around Pagnol's hometown of Aubagne, but hefound that to be a semi-urban sprawl.   Outdoor scenes were no problem. He located an old farm in thehilltop municipality and commune of Riboud, which has a restaurant,a post office, a town hall and a total population of five.   The village scenes for ``Manon des Sources'' were not so easy.   Finally Berry settled on Mirabeau, farther north in theVaucluse. But he had to pay the town to put off installing parkingmeters and painting white lines around the fountain that gave nowater..</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 12</NOTE></DOC>
