Manuel Antonio Noriega was not``some American operation,'' and he wants ``to see democracy inPanama succeed.''   Bush's spokesman said the government would continue seekingNoriega's ouster.   ``Nothing's changed. Everything remains the same. We'll continueto press for Noriega's removal'' and his arrest to stand trial inthe United States on drug charges, said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   Late Tuesday, after a day of sorting out conflicting reports onthe coup attempt, Fitzwater said U.S. officials had determined ithad failed. Soon after, Noriega's officials claimed victory inPanama City.   Though the overthrow attempt, by members of the PanamanianDefense Forces, failed after a morning gun battle at the forces'headquarters, Fitzwater said the attempt ``shows the opposition toNoriega within Panama. It shows there is a strong faction at leastwithin the PDF (Panamanian Defense Forces) that felt he should beremoved.''   ``We did not take any action that would have constituted directinvolvement,'' said Fitzwater. ``We had helicopters that were inthe air observing and we had some troops around one of thecauseways there to protect access and rights and so forth.''   Bush himself told reporters emphatically, ``There were rumorsaround that this was some American operation and I can tell youthat is not true.''   Greeting Mexican President Carlos Salinas De Gortari for a Statedinner at the White House, Bush was asked if he were disappointedthat the coup failed. Bush stated emphatically, ``I want to seedemocracy in Panama succeed.''   Tuesday night, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., introduced legislationauthorizing the president to use the armed forces to remove Noriegafrom power and bring him to the United States.   The president, meanwhile, refused to speculate on whether heshould have used the military to intervene.   ``I know the facts and some of the critics don't,'' Bush said inresponse to questions at the White House dinner.   The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee for not makingit a U.S. operation _ for not sending U.S. troops to help theinsurgents.   ``Here you have brave people in Panama ... trying to ridthemselves of a drug dealer and a thug who's taken over theircountry,'' said the chairman, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., after anhour-long classified briefing from CIA officials.   ``And for the United States, with all of our strength and forceand all of our belief in democracy, to stand by _ two miles away asthe crow flies _ and do nothing, and allow these people to fail,personally I think is wrong.''   But according to an article in Wednesday editions of the StarTribune of Minneapolis, it was opposition from Boren a year agothat defeated a plan approved by President Reagan to finance, trainand supported disaffected Panamanian officers in an attempt tooverthrow Noriega.   Boren objected that the effort was too close to the election,might amount to authorizing assassination and might result in thedeaths of many Americans, according to the Star Tribune's accountquoting unidentified ``well-placed'' sources.   Fitzwater said a State Department official, Bernard Aronson,informed Bush after the president met with the visiting Sovietdefense minister that Noriega's forces appeared to be prevailing.   ``He just said `OK,' and went into another meeting,'' saidFitzwater.   The spokesman said visiting Mexico President Carlos Salinas deGortari. in a meeting earlier Tuesday with Bush had ``emphasizedthe integrity of the various countries in Central America, and wehave respected that integrity and have not intervened.''   The Bush administration, like the Reagan administration beforeit, has called repeatedly for Noriega's ouster.   Bush, speaking to reporters before the outcome in Panama Citywas clear, appeared intent on influencing the situation in Panamain favor of the insurrectionists.   Asserting that he hoped his words would be ``conveyedinstantly'' to Panama, Bush said, ``We have no argument with thePanamanian Defense Forces. We've had good relations with thePanamanian Defense Forces.   ``Our argument has been, as have many other countries, with Mr.Noriega who aborted the democratic will of the people of Panama.And that's where our argument was and that's where our argumentis.''   Last May, Bush had told reporters, ``I would love to see themget him out.''   Asked then if he were calling for the Panamanian Defense Forcesto overthrow Noriega, Bush replied, ``We'd like to see him out ofthere, not just the PDF, the will of the people of Panama. ... Iwould add no words of caution. The will of the people should beimplemented.''   Fitzwater acknowledged that the United States had some advanceword that a coup attempt might be afoot but said he was unaware ofNoriega's fate or even his whereabouts.   ``We had some indications this sort of thing was in the works,but until it happens, you never know,'' Fitzwater said. Hecharacterized the prior information as ``rumblings.''   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United Stateswould move quickly toward normalizing relations with Panama ifNoriega is deposed but added that any such step would be impossibleso long as Noriega remains in power.   After Noriega was indicted by two Florida grand juries on drugsmuggling charges in February 1988, the Reagan administrationimposed a series of economic sanctions in a bid to oust thegeneral, who is commander of Panama's military forces.   Among other actions, the administration froze all Panamanianassets in the United States. For the past 19 months, the UnitedStates has not recognized the Noriega-led government as the legalauthority in Panama.   Fitzwater said Bush was first alerted about the gunfire byNational Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft shortly before thepresident met with Mexican President Salinas.   Then, Scowcroft gave a briefing to both Bush and Salinasjointly, although details in late morning remained sketchy,Fitzwater said.   About 50,000 Americans live in Panama, including more than12,000 U.S. military personnel attached to the U.S. SouthernCommand.   At the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher saidAmerican citizens living in Panama were being asked to stay at home.   The U.S. Southern Command put its troops and civilians on theisthmus on Delta Alert, its highest level of readiness. Americantroops in combat gear took up positions 600 yards from the barracksin downtown Panama City.   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said U.S. troops in Panama werenot involved in any way in the disturbance. He added, ``Ourfacilities down there are locked up; they are secure.''   The American military personnel in Panama have been ordered tostay put and not to travel on roads outside the U.S.-ownedfacilities, Williams said.   The headquarters of the Defense Forces command is about one-halfmile from the scene of the shooting and mortar fire, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
