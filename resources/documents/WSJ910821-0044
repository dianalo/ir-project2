I'm not even sure that itmatters. The firm has admitted to breaking the rules in fourseparate U.S. Treasury auctions, to using the names of itscustomers fraudulently, and to submitting an illegal bid for$1 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds as a &quot;practical joke.&quot;   The firm's managers at first pleaded total ignorance ofthe deeds, and then a few days later altered their story,confessing they had known of the violations since April. Theynow say that they simply forgot to inform the relevantofficials. Last weekend, facing growing outrage and certaindismissal, Salomon's three most senior executives -- JohnGutfreund, Thomas Strauss and John Meriwether -- resigned.</LP><TEXT>   They did not accept blame. They denied any seriouswrongdoing. Messrs. Gutfreund and Strauss sounded less likedisgraced executives than like a pair of ungrammaticalmartyrs. The two said in their public statements: &quot;We cannotlet our unfortunate mistake of not taking prompt action, whenin April we learned of one unauthorized bid at a FebruaryTreasury auction, to harm the firm. We are taking this actionto protect the firm, its 9,000 people and its clients.&quot;   I would be surprised if anyone at Salomon actuallybelieves that Messrs. Gutfreund and Strauss had no idea thatthe traders who sat a few yards from them were routinelybreaking the rules. I certainly don't. While at Salomon inthe mid-1980s, I watched several U.S. Treasury auctions, andnever were either Mr. Strauss or Mr. Gutfreund far from theaction. They usually helped to prepare the bids. What ismore, the top management of Salomon receives daily reports onthe firm's bond holdings.   Even if the gentlemen somehow succeeded in turning a blindeye to all five of the auctions in which Salomon has admittedwrongdoing, they could hardly have failed to notice thelarger-than-legal holdings on the Salomon balance sheets. Andif they knew, as they have admitted, of a single violation inApril, how did they permit the occurrence of another, largerviolation in May?   American financial scandals are seldom what they pretendto be. The securities laws have always been used to punishfinanciers for perfectly legal activity. This was true of thelegendary U.S. Senate investigation of 1934, when J.P. MorganJr. was dragged before the Senate to discuss his role in thisnation's financial collapse, only to be ridiculed for havingpaid no income tax in the previous three years. His realcrime was undisguised piggishness. This was also true inMichael Milken's conviction for breaking six laws few peopleeven knew existed. His real &quot;crimes&quot; were creating junk bondsand leveraged buyouts and loitering in the vicinity of thesavings and loan crisis.   I think it's fair to assume that most of the people whoare angry at Salomon Brothers neither know nor care about thelaws it has broken. The firm's real crime was its curiousattitude toward the truth.   This is worth trying to explain. Why did Mr. Gutfreundtell such stupid stories? The first answer is that hethought, not unjustifiably, that they would be believed.   The chairman of Salomon Brothers has always had a gift fordisinformation. Not long ago I was treated to a trivial butamusing dose of this, after I published my book, &quot;Liar'sPoker,&quot; about my three years with the firm. In it I describedthe ritual Salomon trading floor game (of betting on theserial numbers on hidden banknotes) that gave the book itstitle. The description included a story of a million dollarhand, in which John Meriwether bluffed John Gutfreund. I hadbeen told the story by (among others) Mr. Meriwether himself.I had no reason to doubt him. I had watched with my own eyesas John Gutfreund gambled away enormous sums of money atliar's poker, and viewed the million dollar hand as no morethan an extension of his daily routine.   Salomon Brothers' response to the publication of thisstory boggled my mind almost as much as it inflated myroyalties. Acting under instructions from Mr. Gutfreund, theSalomon Brothers public relations man told reporters that thegame occurred, but that it had been a practical joke. He waswidely disbelieved. A few weeks later the Salomon spokesmanmysteriously changed his story: The game had happened, andwas presumably serious, but it had not involved Mr.Gutfreund. It had involved another managing director, who hadrecently died, and so was unavailable for comment. TheSalomon spokesman was again ridiculed. Months later I openeda newspaper to find Mr. Gutfreund himself claiming that thestory was pure fiction.   The point of all this is not that you should believe mystory, agreeable to me as that would be, but that youcouldn't logically believe all of theirs.   People who haven't worked on Wall Street have troubleunderstanding that the market often values lies more highlythan the truth. I offer this less as criticism than as simpleobservation; to see how such intelligent people could getcaught in such silly lies you have to understand the peculiarrules of their daily game. Traders spend a large part oftheir day pretending to their rivals to be selling when theywant to buy, and buying when they want to sell. Salesmenspend an even larger part of their day overpraising mediocreinvestments to their clients. This is less venal than itsounds. Everyone who deals with financial intermediariesknows better than to believe everything he hears. Anyone whodoesn't is regarded as a fool.   The history of Salomon Brothers is littered with thebodies of people stupid enough to believe what they were toldby their superiors. One small example: Young people whoentered the firm in the mid-1980s were told by Mr. Gutfreundto trust the firm to decide where in the firm they should beemployed; that no one would ever suffer for working in adying market. As a result, hundreds of perfectly capable buttrusting people ended up selling municipal bonds andmoney-market instruments. One day in October 1987 theyarrived at Salomon Brothers to learn that Mr. Gutfreund hadfired their entire departments. Like any good bond trader,Mr. Gutfreund was able to put a price on anything, includinghis word. When the cost of keeping it became too high, hesold.   Only I don't believe that he was always as cynical asthat. Throughout his career Mr. Gutfreund had a naturalability to confuse his self-interest with high principle. Hewas less cynical than carefully self-deluded. In 1987, forexample, he used several hundred million dollars ofshareholders' funds to pay Warren Buffett to save himselffrom the wrath of Ronald Perelman, the corporate raider whowanted to take over Salomon; Mr. Gutfreund did this, heclaimed, only because Mr. Perelman was not the sort of personwho should run an investment bank. I think he really believedit.   The same year he loudly declined to accept a bonus, whileawarding himself stock options worth even more than theforgone bonus. Still, he was able to convince himself andothers that he was making a genuine sacrifice. If you readthe press cuttings, you'll find that in most cases JohnGutfeund was taken at his word. The current scandal may wellhave occurred because the chairman thought he would bebelieved once again. But for the first time in his brilliantcareer, he fooled only himself.   ---   Mr. Lewis, the author of &quot;Liar's Poker,&quot; will publish &quot;TheMoney Culture&quot; (W.W. Norton) in October.</TEXT></DOC>
