The gunmen, reportedly Haitian soldiers, threw their weaponsdown as they turned themselves in, the FBI said. No one was hurt.   The two men seized the twin-engine Cessna 402 at Cap Haitienairport on Haiti's North Coast. They were armed with a .38-caliberrevolver, an assault rifle and a 40mm anti-tank shell, the FBI said.   The hijackers were identified as Guillaume Berlioze, 25, andFadael Milord, 29, both of Port-au-Prince. They were scheduled toappear in federal court Tuesday, where they could face charges ofair piracy and illegal weapons possession, said FBI spokesman PaulMiller.   The motive for the hijacking was not immediately clear, Millersaid.   ``We haven't been able to pin that down, but there areindications that they are against the government,'' he said.   The hijackers, who were not in uniform, were deserting membersof Haiti's Dessalines Battalion, said police sources at Cap Haitienairport who spoke on conditon of anonymity.   The 750-member Dessalines was one of two military units involvedin the abortive against Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, Haiti's militarypresident.   Avril appeared Monday to have quieted the sporadic acts ofrebellion by officers and troop units.   The Cessna 402, owned by Missionary Aviation Fellowship ofRedlands, Calif., was hijacked at 11:30 a.m. and landed at MiamiInternational Airport at 2:30 p.m.   A Fellowship spokeswoman, Donna Burns, said the plane held fourHaitians and three Americans, plus the two gunmen and the pilot,Duer Smedley.   ``They boarded at Cap Haitien,'' said Arlene Salac of theFederal Aviation Administration's regional office in Atlanta.   Ms. Burns said the men burst onto the departure ramp at the CapHaitien airport, fired weapons into the air and took over theplane, and the pilot was ordered to fly immediately without filinga flight plan.   An American, who was not immediately identified, witnessed thehijacking in Haiti and alerted Fellowship officials, Ms. Burnssaid. He called Steve Adams, director of operations for MAF in FortLauderdale, who then called authorities. Adams then called Ms.Burns, she said.   ``We're all relieved that it's finally over,'' said JillLindsey, another Fellowship spokeswoman. ``Everything is fine;we're all back to normal. Operations should be back to normal onWednesday.''   The Fellowship is an international Christian aviation groupfounded in 1945. It operates 145 aircraft in Third World countriesto provide rural aviation and radio service.   The Fellowship first started flight service to Haiti in 1979,flying doctors, medicines, supplies and mission and developmentpersonnel. The service has been based at Executive Airport in FortLauderdale, Florida, since 1982.   In October of 1987, a Fellowship single-engine engine Cessna washijacked in Suriname. The pilot was held by a rebel guerrilla groupbefore being released unharmed.</TEXT></DOC>
