The bill, passed by voice vote, would expand last year's Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act to allow the SEC to receive information from foreign governments without subjecting that information to U.S. disclosure laws.    That point had been a stumbling block to foreign cooperation, because many countries with secrecy rules declined to pass along sensitive information to the U.S. agency for fear the SEC would be forced to release it under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.    The bill also would permit the SEC and the exchanges to sanction individuals and firms on foreign securities-laws violations, closing a loophole that allowed the U.S. to be used as a refuge from foreign charges.    &quot;This bill recognizes that as the financial world grows ever smaller through the process of globalization, the reach of enforcement of securities laws must grow larger,&quot; said Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), who introduced the bill.    Last week, the Senate Banking Committee passed a similar measure as part of a broader package of SEC legislation. That bill is expected to pass the full Senate later this year. </TEXT></DOC>
