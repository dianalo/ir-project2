This proposed rule supersedes a previous Notice of Proposed Rulemakingpublished on August 8, 1986 at 51 FR 28576 which proposed to amend theImmigration and Naturalization Service's regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h).The purpose of that proposed rule was to clarify Service requirements forclassification, admission and maintenance of status under the H classification.Due to the controversial nature of the previous proposed rule and the extensivemodifications which the Service proposes to make to the proposal afterconsidering the comments and consulting with affected groups, the Serviceis issuing this new Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to give the public anopportunity to comment on the changes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Interested persons are invited to submit written commentson this proposed rule on or before November 25, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Please submit written comments in triplicate to the Director,Policy Directives and Instructions, Immigration and Naturalization Service,Room 2011, 425 Eye Street NW., Washington, DC 20536.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Flora T. Richardson, Senior ImmigrationExaminer, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., Washington,DC 20536: Telephone: (202) 633-3946.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On August 8, 1986 at 51 FR 28576, theImmigration and Naturalization Service published a Notice of Proposed Rulemakingproposing to amend the Service's regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h). A mainobjective of that rule was to establish realistic standards for determiningwho qualifies as an alien of distinguished merit and ablility for H-1 classification.In this respect, the rule defined profession and preeminence and listedthe eligibility criteria for a member of the professions and for a personwho is preeminent in his or her field. The rule also clarified the licensurerequirement for H-1 classification.The proposed rule specified the different filing requirements for certaintypes of petitions and made other technical amendments designed to promoteconsistency in the adjudication of H petitions. Some requirements weremade more definitive, such as those relating to accompanying aliens, documentationof qualifications of aliens, restrictions on training programs, revocationof approved petitions, and limits on a temporary stay in the United States.Other requirements for obtaining benefits, such as those for extensionof visa petitions and validity periods of petitions were modified. Forthe most part, the proposed rule simply restated in regulatory form existingService policy for the H nonimmigrant classification.The proposed rule generated extensive interest from the general public,labor and management organizations, and Members of Congress regarding standardsfor the H-1 classification. There was concern expressed by many commentersthat the Service was being too restrictive in its interpretation of distinguishedmerit and ability, while others believed that the interpretation and standardsgo beyond Congressional intent and statutory authority. Several CongressionalCommittees were concerned that the regulations may expand the number ofH-1 workers admitted to this country and result in displacement of Americanworkers or depression of wages and working conditions in certain occupationsand industries. They requested that the Service delay publication of afinal rule until October 1, 1988 and during the intervening year, determinethe occupational backgrounds of H-1 workers, the impact of H-1 workerson the American workforce, wages and working conditions of H-1 workers,and the impact of proposed regulations on admission of H-1 workers in industriesnow utilizing such workers.The Service contracted with a well-known consulting firm to conduct a studyon the impact of H-1 nonimmigrants on the American labor market. The resultsof the study were submitted to Congress in July 1988. Overall, the studyfound that the H-1 nonimmigrants admitted to the United States do not havean adverse impact on the labor market in terms of displacement of UnitedStates workers or depression of wages and working conditions. However,the study also found that a significant number of H-1 admissions are entryto mid-level professionals who only nominally meet the statutory standardof ``distinguished merit and ability''. These workers are, for the mostpart, sought by employers to meet labor shortages of American workers inoccupational fields, such as nursing, engineering, and computer science.The contractor concluded that denial of H-1 petitions for such workerswould result in undue hardship to employers and recommended a statutorychange to establish a separate nonimmigrant category to accommodate them.The H-2 category would be inappropriate for these workers because it requiresthe jobs to be temporary in nature. Jobs filled by H-1 professional workersare usually permanent in nature.Congress has again delayed publication of a final rule on the previousAugust 8, 1986, proposed rules until October 1, 1989, to give itself anopportunity to review and respond to the study. Congress would need timeto amend the statute to establish a separate nonimmigrant category forentry to mid-level professionals, or to pass a legal immigration bill whichresponds to the needs of the American labor market. In the meantime, theService is faced with mounting litigation regarding the standards for professionals.In view of this, the Service is proposing this significantly modified Hrule which addresses the major areas of concern of the public, employers,labor organizations and Congress.This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking reflects the Service's policies andinterpretation of Congressional intent for the H classification at thistime. It proposes significant changes from the previous proposed rule regardingthe documentation required to establish eligibility for H-1 classificationas a professional, a person of prominence, or as an accompanying alien.Changes are also proposed to procedures for consultation with unions andother experts, procedures for filing an H petition, and procedures fordocumenting the qualifications of aliens under the H classification. Inaddition, new provisions for the H-2B classification regarding temporarinessand filing requirements are proposed due to the nature and increased volumeof H-2B petitions now being filed since implementation of the ImmigrationReform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986.IRCA amended section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii) to provide a new H-2A nonimmigrantclassification for temporary agricultural labor separate from other temporarynonagricultural services or labor, now designated H-2B.Since there are special criteria for the admission, extension, and maintenanceof status for H-2A workers, the Service published an interim final ruleeffective June 1, 1987, to implement IRCA. Therefore, the provisions ofthis proposed rule will apply to H-2A workers only to the extent that theydo not conflict with the special agricultural provisions. Paragraph (h)(4)of this proposed rule has been reserved for later incorporation of theH-2A provisions. Paragraph (h)(5) of these regulations relate only to nonagricultural(H-2B) services or labor.The Service believes that these proposed revisions would clarify policyas it relates to the H nonimmigrant category for the public and Serviceofficers; would facilitate the admission of exceptional, professional,and skilled workers needed by businesses and other organizations; wouldcurb abuses; and would promotion consistency in Service determinations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Proposed Amendments</ITAG>Filing of Petitions A petition to classify a worker under section 101(a)(15)(H) would be filedby a United States employer (or foreign employer under the H-1 classification)with the Service office which has jurisdiction over I-129H petitions inthe area of intended employment. Such a petition generally involves oneemployer, one beneficiary, and employment in one location. Since the Serviceaccommodates other types of petitions; the proposed rule prescribes filingrequirements which do not fit the usual situation:(A) <T3>Services or training in more than one location.</T3> When the servicesor training will be performed in more than one location, the Service haspreviously allowed the petitioner to file the petition in any one of thelocations where the services will be performed. The Service has difficultyin locating and tracking such petitions when inquiries arise, especiallyin the entertainment industry. For control purposes, the petitioner wouldbe required to file the petition with the Service office which has jurisdictionover I-129H petitions in the area where the petitioner is located. Theaddress which the petitioner specifies on the new Form I-129H as its locationwould be where the petitioner is located for filing purposes. If the petitioneris a foreign employer, the petition would be filed with the Service officewhich has jurisdiction over I-129H petitions in the area where the serviceswill begin.(B) <T3>Agents as petitioner.</T3> In recognition of the fact that certainservices involve workers who are traditionally self-employed or who useagents to arrange their employment with numerous employers, the Servicewould permit an established agent to file a petition in behalf of the employer(s).Whenever the beneficiary(ies) would be employed by a single employer orwhenever the beneficiary(ies) would not be using the services of an establishedagent, the actual employer(s) would have to file the petition.(C) <T3>Multple beneficiaries on an H-1 petition.</T3> The H-1 classificationrequires separate documentation which shows that each individual qualifiesas a professional or person of prominence, except where the person is amember of a group and the reputation of the group as a whole is evaluatedfor H-1 classification, or where the person is an accompanying alien toan individual or group of distinguished merit and ability in the arts,cultural, entertainment, or professional sports field. In view of this,the rule would clarify that the filing of a separate petition for eachH-1 beneficiary is required unless the alien is an accompanying alien ora member of a group.Since documentation oif qualifications of H-2 and H-3 beneficiaries isless complex than for H-1 classification, more than one beneficiary maybe included in an H-2 or H-3 petition if the beneficiaries will be performingthe same service or receiving the same training in the same geographicalarea and will be applying for visas at the same consulate.(D) <T3>Named beneficiaries.</T3> The Service proposes that every H petition,except those involving certain seasonal agricultural workers include thenames of the beneficiary(ies) and other identifying information requiredby Form I-129H. The determination which the Service must make before grantingH-1, H-2, and H-3 classification relates not just to the Service or training,but also the alien's qualifications or circumstances. In addition, theService view the identification of beneficiaries as a control against certainabuses which could occur, as inflating the actual number of workers neededand including ineligible beneficiaries in a group.(E) <T3>Substitution of beneficiaries.</T3> An approved H petition is generallylimited to the named beneficiary(ies). This rule would clarify that substitutionof beneficiaries may be made only in approved H-1 and H-2B petitions involvinga group where the qualifications of the individual beneficiaries were notconsidered in according H classification, such as a foreign hockey team,orchestra, dance troupe, or theatrical group. In all other cases, a newpetition would be required.H-1 Petition for Alien of Distinguished Merit and AbilityThis proposed rule would explain and clarify the standards for H-1 classificationand the Service's criteria for determining which aliens qualify for H-1classification. It also clarifies licensing requirements and defines anaccompanying alien and other terms used in this rule.(A) <T3>Interpretation of distinguished merit and ability.</T3> The Serviceproposes to codify into regulations its interpretation of the statutorystandard for distinguished merit and ability under the H-1 classification.Distinguished merit and ability may be established in one of two ways.First, aliens who are members of the professions within the meaning ofsection 101(a)(32) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(32), are classifiable asaliens of distinguished merit and ability; <T3>Matter of Essex Cryogenics Industries, Inc.,</T3> 14 Iandamp;N Dec. 196(Dep. Assoc. Comm. 1972); <T3>Matter of General Atomic Company,</T3> 17 Iandamp;N Dec. 532 (Comm. 1980).Second, aliens who are prominent or renowned in their field of endeavorare classifiable as aliens of distinguished merit and ability; <T3>Matter of Shaw,</T3> 11 Iandamp;N Dec. 277 (D.D. 1965).Heretofore, the Service has not consolidated into regulation the standardsfor determining who qualifies as a member of the professions or a personof prominence in his or her field. The proposed rule would describe thecurrent criteria for qualification based on case law, and would add twonew categories of prominence (one related to the performing arts and onerelated to business). It would also clarify and simplify the rules fordetermining when a person may be deemed a professional by virtue of educationand experience.(1) <T3>Definition of profession and standards for professionals.</T3> Thisrule would set forth the definition of ``profession'' and the standardsfor qualifying as a member of the professions. A ``profession'' means anoccupation which requires theoretical and practical application of a bodyof specialized knowledge to fully perform the occupation in such fieldsof human endeavor as: Architecture, engineering, mathematics, physicalsciences, social sciences, medicine and health, education, business, accounting,law, and theology. A profession requires completion of a specific courseof education at an accredited college or university, culminating in a baccalaureateor higher degree in a specific professional field, and attainment of suchdegree or its equivalent in the minimum requirement for entry into theprofession in the United States. There are two categories of persons whodo not meet these requirements but are nevertheless regarded as professionals.The first category is persons who, after passage of normal professionaltests and requirements, are granted full state licenses to practice theprofession. The second category is persons who lack the required degreebut, by virtue of a combination of college-level education, specializedtraining or experience, and professional standing are in fact lawfullypracticing at a professional level. (Persons who, because of lack of trainingor licensure, cannot qualify as professionals may, if they have achievedpositions of responsibility and significance in business, qualify as ``prominent''.(See discussion below.) The Service has long recognized that full statelicensure in a profession or a combination of education, experience, andprofessional standing may result in training which is equivalent to theprofessional training which is normally gained through attainment of aprofessional degree. The proposed rule would specify the extent and typeof education and experience required in order for a person to qualify asa professional. Adoption of such a rule would make it easier for the publicto understand the criteria for qualification, and would simplify administrationfor the Service. To qualify as a member of the professions, the alien is required to:andbullet; Hold a United States baccalaureate or higher degree required bythe profession from an accredited college or university, or andbullet; Hold a foreign degree determined to be equivalent to a UnitedStates baccalaureate or higher degree required by the profession from anaccredited college or university, or andbullet; Hold an unrestricted state license which authorizes him or herto fully practice the profession and be engaged in that profession in thestate of intended employment, or andbullet; Have completed at least two years of college-level training appropriateto the profession, have demonstrated that he or she has sufficient specializedtraining and/or professional experience combined with the college-leveleducation to be equivalent to a United States baccalaureate or higher degreerequired by a profession, and have attained professional standing and recognitionin the particular field. (2) <T3>Criteria for prominence.</T3> The basic standard for prominence isthe possession of skills and recognition substantially above those ordinarilyencountered, to the extent that a person so described is prominent in hisor her field of endeavor; <T3>Matter of Shaw, supra.</T3> Although existing case law and regulationsset forth the types of documentation which must be attached to a petitionto establish prominence, this rule would codify those documentation requirementsand would establish definitive standards for determining prominence intwo new categories. Prominence could be established by an individual alienor by a team or ensemble consisting of a group of aliens. The alien(s)would be required to: andbullet; Have sustained national (foreign or U.S.) or international acclaimand recognition for achievements in the particular field evidenced by atleast three different forms of documentation, such as those described inthe rule at (h)(3)(i)(D), or andbullet; Be an artist who, or an artistic group which is recognized bygovernmental agencies, cultural organizations, scholars, arts administrators,critics, or other experts in the particular field for excellence in developing,interpreting, or representing a narrow and clearly identifiable, uniqueor traditional ethnic, folk, cultural, musical, theatrical, or other artisticperformance or presentation; be coming to the United States primarily foreducational or cultural event(s) to further the understanding of or developmentof that art form; and be sponsored primarily be educational, cultural,or governmental organizations which promote such international culturalactivities and exchanges, or andbullet; Have exceptional career achievement in business in executive,managerial, or highly technical positions evidenced by at least three significantfactors such as those specified in the proposed regulations at (h)(3)(i)(C)(<T3>4</T3>).To establish that an alien or group has sustained national or internationalacclaim and recognition for achievements in a particular field, the petitionerwould have to show at the time a petition is filed that the alien or grouphas a prolonged or significant record of critically acclaimed successesand achievements. Persons with ephemeral or short-lived acclaim and recognitionin their field and those who are just developing in a field with potentialfor national or international acclaim are not eligible for H-1 classification.The Service's current regulations describe the types of documentation requiredfor entertainers to establish that they have national or internationalacclaim and recognition in their field. This rule would specify the typesof evidence required to document this standard in any field, includingentertainment. This diversified listing of documentation also providesguidance on how many forms of evidence would be required to establish eligibility.Although the previous proposed rule included the standard types of documentationwhich the service over the years has required for entertainers to establishprominence, the standard and documentation were perceived as new and morerestrictive than current requirements. Most of the commenters were underthe impression that every entertainer must obtain an H-1 visa to performservices in the United States. The fact is that foreign artists who arenot qualified for H-1 status may seek H-2B classification to perform thesame services after obtaining from the Department of Labor a labor certificationor a notice that such certification cannot be made. It appears that manypetitioners have come to rely on the H-1 classification as the most expedientnonimmigrant classification for aliens who perform services in the arts,cultural, and entertainment industry. This is because they have obtainedH-1 petition approvals that were in error in previous years from some fieldoffices that did not follow the standards in existing regulations. While the Service is sensitive to the unique circumstances of the arts,cultural, and entertainment industry, the need to promote cultural exchange,and the desire of the public for exposure to other cultures and a varietyof entertainment, the Service is bound by the statutory requirements ofthe Immigration and Nationality Act in administering the H classification.The Service's regulations, case law, and other policy must conform to Congressionalintent. Congress did not build into the H classification the flexibilityfor the Service to consider such factors as cultural exchanges, reciprocity,freedom and artistic expression, personal preferences, or economic hardshipto the petitioner in according H Classification. Nor is there a mechanismfor applying lesser standards for classification to the arts, cultural,and entertainment industry than to any other industry.The new criteria reflected in the last two standards would recognize certainunique artists or ensembles which previously have not qualified for H-1classification but clearly possess qualifications which are exceptionalin nature, and certain persons with exceptional career achievement in business.The Service does not believe that inclusion of such persons under the H-1classification would have an adverse impact on the labor market nor wouldit diminish the stringent standards for distinguished merit and abilitypreviously required for H-1 classification. The rule would include in the H-1 distinguished merit and ability category,artists who are recognized exponents of unique forms of artistic expressionwhich by their nature cannot receive the national or international acclaimwhich is possible in what might be termed the mainstream arts. Artistsin this subcategory must still be recognized for their excellence and significancein minor or performing art forms by authorities in ethno-musicology, drama,dance, etc. Events where qualifying artists perform or present their artform would have to be primarily educational or cultural in nature. Thisprovision would exclude artists who are coming to the United States primarilyto provide commercial entertainment.The second new standard under the prominence category would rectify thesituation whereby certain aliens with substantial amounts of work experienceand significant achievements in business are employed in high-level positionsrequiring a broad range of responsibilities but have not been able to qualifyfor H-1 classification as professionals or persons of prominence by currentstandards, while a recent college graduate in a profession, such as engineering,can qualify. To qualify as prominent, the alien would be required to haveexceptional career achievement in business in executive, managerial, orhighly technical positions evidenced by at least three factors, such asmanagerial responsibility for at least 100 employees, 10 years of experience,salary in excess of $75,000 per year, and contributions of significanceto the business industry. Every individual who owns or manages a businessor who holds a high position in a business would not be considered prominent.In addition, this new category is not intended to accommodate all otherhigh level business persons who cannot qualify as professionals. (3) <T3>Accompanying alien status. </T3>The proposed rule would authorize accompanyingalien status only for highly skilled, essential support staff who accompanyH-1 beneficiaries in the arts, cultural, entertainment, and professionalsports fields to the United States. This provision is intended to recognizethat certain individuals or groups in the arts, cultural, entertainment,and professional sports fields provide a variety of short-term servicesand rely on the same individuals to regularly provide essential supportfor those services, such as the band for an H-1 vocalist or the choreographerfor a dance troupe. The personal preference of the H-1 individual or groupfor working with a particular individual would not be a consideration ingrantig accompanying alien status. Essential support staff would derive H-1 classification from the H-1 alienor group in the above fields to whom his or her skills are essential if:andbullet; The alien is coming to the United States to perform support serviceswhich cannot be readily performed by a U.S. worker,andbullet; The alien's services are essential to the successful performanceof services to be rendered by the H-1 alien or group, and andbullet; The alien possesses appropriate qualifications, significant priorexperience with the H-1 alien or group, and critical knowledge of the specifictype of services to be performed so as to render success of the servicesdependent upon his or her participation.(4) <T3>Consultation with experts. </T3>The proposed rule would provide thatthe director shall approve or deny a petition in the entertainment industrybased on the information in the record when he or she has no doubt aboutH-1 eligibility or ineligibility. In all other cases, before making a decision,it is proposed that the director shall consult unions, other organizations,or recognized critics or other experts in the appropriate entertainmentfield regarding the qualifications of the alien and the nature of the servicesto be performed. This rule would establish a system for seeking a balanceof views in doubtful cases. The regulations would require consultationwith a management organization whenever an opinion is sought from a labororganization. In addition, the director would have the discretion to consultwith critics or other experts instead of a labor and a management organization.Licensure for H Classification This rule would clarify the licensure requirement for H classification.An alien who is accorded H classification must be able to engage in hisor her occupation immediately upon entering the United States. If the occupationrequires a state or local license for an individual to engage in that occupation,an alien seeking H classification in that occupation must have that licenseto be found qualified to enter the United States and immediately engagein the occupation. A temporary license (except for a professional nurse)is acceptable if the alien is authorized to fully perform the duties ofthe occupation under applicable state law. There are two exceptions to the licensure requirement. First, where a stateallows an individual to fully engage in the occupation under the supervisionof licensed senior or supervisory personnel, H classification may be accorded.Second, where a foreign professional nurse has passed the Commission onGraduates of Foreign Nursing Schools examination and met other prescribedrequirements, H classification may be accorded. Whenever the alien possesses a temporary license (or results of the CGFNSin the case of professional nurses), it is proposed that the petition shallbe approved for a period not to exceed one year. The alien's request forextension of stay beyond one year would have to include evidence that heor she has obtained a permanent license or still holds a temporary licensevalid through the period of time which the extention is requested. H-2B Petition for Alien To Perform Temporary Services or Labor Every petition to classify an alien as an H-2B temporary nonimmigrant workermust have attached to it either a labor certification or a notice thatsuch certification cannot be made, from the Secretary of Labor or the Governorof Guam, as appropriate. This rule would define temporary services, establishcertain guidelines under which an H-2B petition could be filed, and specifythe documentation required to accompany an H-2B petition. (A) <T3>Temporary services. </T3>An H-2B nonagricultural temporary worker mustbe coming temporarily to the United States to perform temporary servicesor labor, if United States workers capable of performing such servicesor labor cannot be found or will not be displaced and the employment willnot adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similar employedU.S. workers. Temporary services or labor under the H-2B classificationwould mean any job where the petitioner's need for the duties to be performedby the employee(s) is temporary regardless of whether the underlying jobcan be described as permanent or temporary. As a general rule, the periodof the petitioner's need would have to be a year or less, although theremay be extraordinary circumstances where the temporary services or laborwould last longer than one year. The petitioner's need for the servicesor labor would have to be a one-time occurence, a seasonal need, a peakloadneed, or an intermittent need. The regulations would define these terms.(B) <T3>Filing guidelines. </T3>This rule would limit the term of a labor certificationto one year. This provision would merely set forth in the regulations whatis the actual practice of the Secretary of Labor and the Governor of Guamin issuing temporary labor certifications. For H-2B classification, thepetitioner would have to be a United States employer or the authorizedrepresentative of a foreign employer which shall have a location in theUnited States, shall have a United States location, shall consider availableU.S. workers for the temporary services or labor, and shall offer termsand conditions of employment which are consistent with the nature of theoccupation, activity, and industry in the United States. The petitionerwould not be able to file an H-2B petition unless the United States petitionerhad applied for a labor certification with the Secretary of Labor or theGovernor of Guam within the time limits prescribed or accepted by eachand had obtained a labor certification determination. (C) <T3>Evidence. </T3>The rule would specify the evidence that is requiredto accompany an H-2B petition. In particular, the petitioner would be requiredto provide documentation that the individual alien qualifies for the joboffer as specified in the labor certification, except in petitions involvinga group. The rule sets forth Service requirements for countervailing evidencewhen the petitioner receives a notice that a certification cannot be made.The petitioner would be required to address availability or nonavailabilityof U.S. workers, the prevailing wage rate and working conditions in theoccupation, and each of the reasons why the Secretary of Labor or the Governorof Guam could not grant the labor certification. (D) <T3>Changes to procedures for Guam. </T3>Minor technical changes wouldbe made to temporary labor certification procedures for the Territory ofGuam to give the Governor authority to expedite the processing of applicationsin emergent situations and to clarify approval and reporting requirements.For normal processing of temporary labor certification applications, theemployer must still place a job order with the Employment Service systemfor a period of 30 days. This rule would allow the Governor, at his discretion,to reduce this period by as much as 20 days for applications in the entertainmentindustry. The rule would also clarify that the Commissioner of Immigrationand Naturalization must approve specific construction wage rates on Guamprior to implementation of new rates; specify the frequency of wage surveys;and require the Governor of Guam to furnish quarterly reports of laborcertification workload and determinations. <T3>H-3 Classification for Alien Trainees</T3>(A) <T3>Standards for H-3 training programs. </T3>The Service proposes to clarifyand incorporate the administrative interpretations of requirements forH-3 classification from published decisions and other Service policy overthe years. Key considerations in determining the validity of an H-3 trainingprogram would be: Whether there is a structured training program; whetherthe training is actually productive employment; whether the training willbenefit the alien in pursuing a career abroad; whether the training isavailable in the alien's country; and whether the alien has the skillswhich the training program intends to provide. The proposed restrictionson approval of a training program that are specified in this rule are designedto clarify to petitioners and Service officers conditions under which anH-3 training program fails to meet these basic criteria. (B) <T3>Duration of training. </T3>The Service has observed that the H-3 classificationis often requested to enable the alien to engage in actual employment underthe guise to a training program. It is the Service's view that the longerthe period of training the more likely it is that the alien will be engagedin productive employment. This rule would limit the duration of an H-3training program to two years. <T3>Extension of visa petition and extension of stay application procedures</T3>Current regulations require the filing and approval of an abbreviated visapetition and an application for extension of stay in order to extend thebeneficiary's stay in the United States. This procedure would be amendedto require only the filing of an application of extension of stay by thebeneficiary, accompanied by a letter (or labor certification determinationin H-2 cases) from the employer restating the terms and conditions of employmentas specified in the original petition. No action would be taken with respectto the visa petition if the beneficiary's application for extension ofstay were denied. Approval of the beneficiary's application for extensionof stay would automatically extend the visa petition for the same period.This change in procedure would reduce workload in our Regional AdjudicationCenters, where petition extensions constiture a significant portion oftheir workload. The procedure will also reduce burden and cost to employersinvolved in this procedure. Limits on a Temporary Stay (Temporariness) As with H-1 and L applicants, the Service believes that adoption of a generousbut specific limit on a temporary stay in the United States in the H-3category would curb abuses and best serve the interests of the Serviceand the affected public. Current regulations already limit the stay ofan H-2 beneficiary in the United States to three years. This rule proposesto limit the stay of an H-3 beneficiary to two years. The Service believesthat a two year period is sufficient to accomplish the purposes of enteringthe United States in the H-3 classification. Extensions of stay in incrementsof six months would be granted in the H-3 classification as long as thetotal period of stay did not exceed two years. After an H-2 beneficiaryhas spent three years in the United States, and and H-3 beneficiary hasspent two years in the United States, this rule would require that a newpetition for the alien in the H or L classification would not be approvednor would the alien be readmitted to the United States as an H or L nonimmigrantunless the alien departed voluntarily and resided outside the United Statesfor six months. The limitations on petition approval and readmission wouldnot apply to aliens whose employment is seasonal, intermittent, or aggregateof six months or less a year. Effect of Obtaining a Labor Certification or Filing a Preference Petitionin the H-2 and H-3 ClassificationsThe rule would specify that the approval of a permanent labor certificationor the filing or a preference petition for an H-2 or H-3 alien beneficiaryin the same or a different job or training position with the same employerwould be a ground to deny a new petition or the alien's application foran extension of stay. (A) <T3>H-2 classification. </T3>In the case of an H-2 beneficiary, the employerpreviously submitted satisfactory representations that the need for theskills, or labor was temporary. If the employer's need has changed, thebeneficiary no longer qualifies for H-2 classification in the same job.To avoid abuses of the H-2 classification, the Service would also not acceptrepresentative that the permanent services would be in a different jobwhen the labor certification of preference petition is filed by the sameemployer. (B) <T3>H-3 beneficiary. </T3>In the case of an H-3 beneficiary, the employerwas required to demonstrate that the training position was to benefit thebeneficiary in pursuing a career outside the United States. When that sameemployer obtains a labor certification or files a preference petition forthe beneficiary, the Service would conclude that the purpose of the trainingwas to recruit and train the alien to ultimately staff a position in theUnited States. The Service believes that the proposed changes reflected in this proposedrule will benefit the public to the extent that they clarify requirements,curb abuses, and make the H category more useful to businesses and otherorganizations. They would make clear Service policy regarding admission,the alien's temporary stay in the United States, and requirements for petitionersand beneficiaries who seek approval or classification under the H nonimmigrantcategory.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of Immigration andNaturalization certifies that the rule does not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.
