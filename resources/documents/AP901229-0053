Although the kingdom does supply some information, it does notshare data on wind speed and direction, fearing that teletypereports would aid Iraq in launching a chemical or biologicalattack., the forecaster said.   ``It's not as good as what we get in the States,'' said Capt.Judy Dickey, referring to the extensive network of weatherreporting stations operated by the military and the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration.   ``They aren't transmitting any wind data because of the chemicalthreat. They don't want the upper level winds to go out worldwideso the Iraqis could pick it up,'' she said.   She said the forecasts are good enough to provide planninginformation for commanders to help them decide whether to attack.But still, the U.S. military could use the wind data to help plan adefense against chemical attack, she said.   Capt. Dickey, who produces forecasts for the 1st TacticalFighter Wing, said the nightmare condition would be a ``shamal'' -a violent, 100-mile-wide sandstorm that could shut down airoperations and impede ground units in combat.   The shamal, or northwest wind, is a rare occurrence that drivessand at speeds of more than 50 mph and can cause haze as high as18,000 feet. Sand propelled at that speed can strip paint fromcars.   Moreover, she said, the same conditions that give rise to theshamal also can cause smaller disturbances that affect specificregions, hampering air, ground, and sea operations.   At Christmas, for example, Dickey thought a shamal was brewing.Blowing sand cut visibility to one mile, with winds at 32 mph.   ``That was sort of a little precursor to a shamal,'' she said.``Sort of a little appetizer, I guess.''   She said forecasters could only give a two-to-three day warningof a shamal.   The United States has a limited weather staff in Saudi Arabia,split primarily between the Air Force and the Navy. Capt. Dickeysaid measurement of weather conditons is the most difficultproblem.   Comprehensive data, which requires the regular launching ofweather balloons and surface measurements from a wide area, are notcollected regularly by the military, she said. They depend on theSaudis for the rest.   The 25-year-old captain from Anaheim, Calif. said some data iscollected from occasional balloon launches by the Marine Corps.``When they do it, we get great data. But they don't have enoughballoons to do it twice a day like we do in the States.''   The military is coping by pooling data obtained from pilots, butsuch general information is useless for pinpointing the localized``dust devils'' that play havoc with ground forces. The best themilitary can do is warn ground forces that conditions are favorablefor a sandstorm in a given region.   At sea, military sources have said swells of eight feet andgreater have been observed. High seas could delay amphibiouslandings by some landing craft.   Soldiers are already coping with markedly colder temperatures ineastern Saudi Arabia. Capt. Dickey said January - the month inwhich combat operations could begin - is one of the coldest, withovernight lows in the 40s.   It's a big switch from 100-degree-plus temperatures that greetedthe first units of the U.S. force deployed to Saudi Arabiafollowing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.   In the northern desert, temperatures plunged to 34 degreesThursday and Friday night, forcing soldiers to burrow deeper intotheir sleeping bags.   ``You can feel it down to the bone. If you don't wear yourlongjohns, you'll be freezing,'' said Army Spec. Hector Macias, 25,of El Paso, Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
