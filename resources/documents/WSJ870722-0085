Rep. George Miller (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Interior Committee's panel on water and power resources, sharply criticized the agreement, which was developed in secret, and questioned whether it will &quot;give away&quot; public resources for too little.    Interior Department officials have said they intend to submit the land exchange to Congress for approval. But since the agency might have authority to perform the exchange administratively, Rep. Miller joined Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) in sponsoring legislation that would bar completion of the trade without congressional consent.    The oil rights to acreage in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's 1.5 million acre coastal plain is slated to be exchanged for surface rights to 891,000 acres of native-owned lands elsewhere in Alaska, a department spokesman confirmed. The refuge acreage to be transferred is five times larger than that discussed in prior House questioning of agency officials on the dealings.    News of private meetings to carve up the refuge July 9 and 10 surprised some in Congress, who had assumed the trade was being delayed because of opposition.    Yesterday, Rep. Miller claimed, &quot;The megatrades are usurping the Congress's authority&quot; to decide when and how the refuge in Northeastern Alaska would be developed.    He also released documents showing that in a prior exchange involving the refuge, the Interior Department obtained $5.9 million of land in the Brooks Range in return for granting a native Alaskan corporation subsurface rights on the coastal plain valued at $388 million. Calling that &quot;a $382 million gift to one native corporation and their oil company partners,&quot; he asked if the current trades are &quot;as seriously flawed.&quot;    Through a spokesman, William Horn, Interior Department assistant secretary, said that federal law authorized the Arctic Slope Regional Corp. to acquire that prior parcel in exchange for equal acreage elsewhere, rather than of equal value.    The spokesman said Mr. Horn didn't quarrel with claims that the law authorized an equal-area exchange only after the refuge is opened to oil drilling by Congress, but said Mr. Horn &quot;thinks he got a pretty good deal&quot; because he obtained more valuable land than he might have received if he had waited until the refuge was opened. Besides, the spokesman said, that exchange was publicized and no one challenged it.    Each native group participating in the exchanges has agreed to lease its lands to oil companies if Congress opens the refuge to development.    According to native Alaskan representatives and Interior Department officials, the companies include Exxon Corp., Du Pont Co.'s Conoco Inc. unit, Atlantic Richfield Co., Phillips Petroleum Co., Texaco Inc., Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co. unit, and three companies that obtained acreage in the refuge under the previous exchange: Chevron Corp., British Petroleum Co. and its Standard Oil Co. unit. </TEXT></DOC>
