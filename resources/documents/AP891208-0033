DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   S.B. Lewis andamp; Co. will withdraw as a registeredsecurities broker-dealer and put as much as $1.15 million in escrowto settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges.   The funds belong to managing partner Salim B. ``Sandy'' Lewis,one of Wall Street's best-known figures, who pleaded guilty tostock manipulation and related charges. The company pleaded guiltyAug. 30 in New York to two felony securities law violations at thesame time.   The firm's agreement to withdraw as a broker-dealer within 90days was part of a settlement of an administrative action Lewis andamp;Co. reached Thursday with the SEC.   The case against Lewis stemmed indirectly from the Ivan Boeskyinsider trading scandals. Lewis' attorney, Stanley S. Arkin, saidthat while the company has reached a settlement with the SEC, ``Mr.Lewis has not.''   Arkin declined to comment on negotiations between Lewis and theSEC.   Vincent DiBlasi, attorney for the company, was not in hisManhattan office when called for comment Thursday evening.   Under the terms of its settlement with the SEC, Lewis andamp; Co.,registered with the SEC since 1980, will ``cease operation as abroker-dealer.''   According to SEC documents, the company is ``in the process ofliquidation.''   Also as part of the agreement, Lewis andamp; Co. will place any moneyit has that is due Salim B. Lewis _ up to $1.15 million _ in escrowuntil all matters between the SEC, Lewis and the firm ``have beenfinally resolved.''   The company also will place in escrow an amount equal to theinterest on $1.15 million from May 9, 1986 _ when Lewis's illegalactivities began _ until Thursday under the same conditions. TheSEC did not specify how much that would be.   Lewis pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to charges ofmanipulating the price of Fireman's Fund common stock three yearsago, aiding and abetting the falsification of records andstock-margin violations.   The three felony charges against him carry a total maximum15-year prison term and $2.75 million in fines. He is scheduled tobe sentenced Dec. 15.   Lewis and his brokerage firm were named in a 22-count federalindictment in November 1988 that claimed he manipulated Fireman'sFund stock price just before American Express Co. announced thesale of Fireman's Fund shares in 1986.   Charges against Lewis stemmed from a 1987 guilty plea of BoydJefferies, former head of the Los Angeles brokerage firm Jefferiesandamp; Co. who turned state's evidence. Jefferies had been implicated byBoesky, the now imprisoned speculator who settled insider tradingcharges in November 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
