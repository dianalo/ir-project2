 Users do not have to request that atape or optical disk be mounted, and they don't have to wait for the data tobe restored to a server disk.andM;Because LANs and the file servers connected to them continue to grow, networkadministrators eventually will be forced to build their ownstorage-management architectures or to rely on new developments frommanufacturers of backup systems.andM;Currently, the least expensive solution to a full hard disk is to add anotherdisk to the file server.andM;By 1992, however, the amount of data stored on file servers withincorporations will cause a data-management crisis, according to estimates byPeripheral Strategies Inc., a Santa Barbara, Calif., market-research firm.andM;By that time, network managers will have placed three or four hard disks oneach file server, and they will be responsible for the management of manygigabytes of data and tens of thousands of user files.andM;The amount of time and the complexity involved in managing this data will betremendous, so developers of backup systems are creating automated systems toperform those management tasks.andM;One way to manage large pools of data on LANs is to adopt thestorage-management architecture used on mainframes, which establishes asliding scale of storage options ranging in accessibility and cost from &quot;hot&quot;to &quot;cold.&quot;andM;Hot files are used often; They are stored on magnetic media, such asWinchester disks, so they are available immediately.andP;  Files that are accessedless often are stored on optical devices (warm storage), while files thathave not been used in more than 60 days, for example, migrate to coolstorage, such as tape.andP;  Cold storage files are copies of files storedoff-site.andM;The most cost-effective way in which to implement a data-management system isto spread the cost over a range of storage media.andM;The challenge for software developers is to make the distribution of thefiles transparent to users -- whether a file is retrieved from a hard disk,or called back from an optical disk or a tape jukebox.andM;Mountain Network Solutions Inc., of Campbell, Calif., is developing a networkdata-management product that uses graphical user interfaces to manage thedistribution of information between file servers and workstations.andM;File Talk 2.0, which is scheduled for delivery next summer, provides anarchitecture for maintaining a database of backup operations.andP;  It alsoprovides a tool for network users to retrieve files from servers across thenetwork and from individual user workstations, and a method for users to backup their own hard disks or restore a file from a storage device.andM;The File Talk system is designed to distribute data across LANs so, forexample, a network administrator could disseminate files from his workstationin New York to file servers in California.andM;Mountain also plans to support a variety of LAN operating systems, includingOS/2 LAN Manager and Novell NetWare, and to service different workstationoperating systems, ranging from DOS and OS/2 to the Macintosh System 6.0.7.andM;Mountain's ambitious plans follow in the footsteps of other providers ofbackup systems that already have some elements of network data management inplace -- in most cases for NetWare-based LANs.andM;Companies including Palindrome Corp., Cheyenne Software Inc., PropellerHeadSoftware, Tecmar Inc. and Emerald Systems Corp. offer archival software thatkeeps a database of backed-up files and the names of tapes on which they arestored.andM;Few offerings exist for OS/2 LAN Manager, although OS/2 developers such asSytron Corp. already provide some backup tools within their current backupsoftware programs.andP;  Sytron officials claim that their Sytos Plus softwareprovides built-in hooks to provide network data management, such as a disklibrary of all backups.andP;  However, Sytos Plus lacks the ability to analyze thehard disk to determine the last time the backed-up files were accessed andthe number of backup copies made.andM;Other OS/2 products can integrate with data-management systems such as SarosCorp.'s FileShare -- which runs on OS/2 and NetWare file servers to provideworkstation users with transparent access to files distributed across anetwork -- and relational databases such as SQL Server, so that anadministrator can automatically define the number of copies of files storedand where they are stored in backup storage systems.andM;Mainframe ConceptsandM;In today's NetWare world, Palindrome's Network Archivist -- one of the firstproducts to bring mainframe storage-management concepts to LANs -- uses arelational database to store a record of each backup session, noting whichfiles have been copied to a particular tape or other type of storage device.andM;Network Archivist also uses artificial-intelligence rules to determine theimportance of a particular version of a file and its last date of use, todetermine if it should be deleted from the file server.andP;  By monitoring thenetwork file system, the archive software can determine when a file was lastaccessed.andM;For example, if a file has not been accessed in 60 days and three copies of astable version of that file exist on three different tapes, the file iserased from the file server.andM;The problem is retrieving the file once that has been done.andM;A mechanism in Palindrome's Network Archivist allows the name of the file tobe left on the file-server directory.andP;  Other systems, however, such asCheyenne Software's ArcServe, don't have that capability.andP;  The user mustinvoke the archival software to find the location of the backed-up copy, andthen have the network manager (or, if available, a mechanical device) mountthe tape and restore the file to the hard disk.andM;By taking advantage of faster optical technologies, such as erasable opticaldrives and digital audiotape (DAT) systems, however, users won't have toperform restores to retrieve information stored on some secondary storagemedia.andP;  With quick-access DAT devices, a user won't have to worry about wherea file was stored if it can be accessed in 5 minutes.andM;While the network data-management software could manage the retrieval ofinformation distributed over a variety of storage media, one way to make theprocess easier is to extend the file-system attributes of the LAN operatingsystem to keep track of the location of a file, following it as it makes itsway from hot to cold storage.andM;Some backup systems already provide this transparency.andM;Vortex Systems Inc.'s RetroChron continuous-backup system appears to the LANoperating system as a file system, although the data may be stored on variouscomponents of the RetroChron storage system, which includes a Winchesterdrive for active files and optical drives for backup storage.andM;Epoch Systems Inc.'s Epoch-1 InfiniteStorage Server, a Unix-based system thatserves workstations running Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Network File System(NFS), is a model of how future data-storage servers could work.andM;The Epoch-1, which functions as both a file server and a backup device,expands the concept of an NFS file server by using WORM optical disks asbackup storage for its magnetic disks.andP;  As the unit's magnetic disks fill up,files are copied to optical disks transparently.andM;The Epoch-1 can provide formidable storage capacity through an optical-diskjukebox that allows 48 optical cartridges to be available within seconds, fora total of 28.8G bytes of storage space.andP;  Tape is also used for off-linebackup storage.andM;When a local or remote user performs an operation that reads a file, theEpoch-1's file system locates the file transparently and returns the properdata.andM;Officials for Epoch Systems said they plan to migrate their technology to PCLANs, but are waiting for the delivery of remote procedure calls and othernetwork computing tools that would enable the Epoch-1 to work as a fileserver for a variety of operating systems without writing a version for eachspecific operating system.andM;File migration could also expand beyond the basis of inactive files to arules-based scheme that moves files to different types of storage media basedon content.andP;  The system could automatically delete all .TMP files created byword processing and not depend on the last access date to determine when toerase them.andM;Similarly, large CAD/CAM files could be located on optical systems, whileup-to-date spreadsheet data could be kept on file servers.andM;By rethinking the theory of data storage and holding networkdata-management-systems providers to their visions of the future, networkmanagers could be in better shape to deal with the growing complexity of thenetworks under their care.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
