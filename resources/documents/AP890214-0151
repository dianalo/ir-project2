Activists in Bhopal denounced the settlement as a betrayal of the20,000 victims who still suffer from exposure to the deadly gas thatescaped from a pesticides plant on Dec. 3, 1984. The government hadsought $3 billion in damages.   Chief Justice R.S. Pathak interrupted a government prosecutor'sroutine argument when the court reconvened after lunch, and orderedthe U.S.-based multinational company to pay the damages by March 31.   Attorneys for the government and Union Carbide promptly agreed.   ``It was apparent that there was an out-of-court agreementbetween Union Carbide and the government,'' said a court officialwho spoke on condition of anonymity. ``For such an order thereshould have been excitement, but there was no murmur even.''   ``It wasn't entirely out of the blue,'' said another source, whoalso spoke on condition of anonymity.   Pathak, citing ``the enormity of human suffering,'' said asettlement was needed to ``provide immediate and substantialrelief.''   More than 2,000 people were killed almost immediately when thewhite vapor of methyl isocyanate seeped from a storage tank at theplant operated by Union Carbide's Indian subsidiary and drifted overnearby shantytowns and into Bhopal.   The leak occurred shortly after midnight, and some victims diedin their sleep. Others, blinded by tears and gasping for breath,tried to flee but collapsed in death.   More than 20,000 people still suffer from exposure to the gas andvictims continue to die at a rate of at least one a day, accordingto a government gas relief board. It says the death toll has reached3,329.   Pathak, speaking for a five-judge Supreme Court panel, orderedUnion Carbide to pay $470 million to the Indian government ``in fulland final settlement of all claims, rights and liabilities relatedto and arising out of the Bhopal gas disaster.''   He also ordered all civil proceedings transferred to the SupremeCourt, and quashed all criminal charges, including one of culpablehomicide filed in 1987 against former Union Carbide chairman WarrenAnderson.   Pathak gave no details of how the money should be paid to thevictims, but he directed government prosecutors and attorneys forthe Danbury, Conn.-based company to submit a detailed agreementWednesday.   ``This is a fair and just settlement,'' Gopal Subramanium, one ofthe chief government attorneys, told a reporter.   In New York, Union Carbide spokesman Earl Slack said Pathak'sorder ``was based on its review of all pleadings in India and theU.S., applicable law and facts, and the enormity of human sufferingthat requires substantial and immediate aid.''   Union Carbide's stock price soared $2.12{ to $31.25 a share inearly trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, andanalysts said they approved of the settlement. The closing price was$31.12{, up an even $2.   ``Psychologically, it's terrific. Financially, it's reasonable,''said Leslie Ravitz, a research director for Salomon Brothers in NewYork. ``This relieves the pressure on Union Carbide and the stigma.''   James Wilbur, a vice president with Smith Barney, Harris Uphamand Co. Inc. in New York, said Union Carbide had set aside $200million and had $250 million in insurance coverage.   ``The risk is minimal,'' he said.   In Bhopal, a city of nearly 1 million people, many politiciansand activists were angered by the settlement.   ``This is a betrayal of the gas victims,'' said Babulal Gaur, astate legislator from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. Hecalled the settlement ``negligible.''   ``The government has once again come under the pressure from thelobby of multinationals,'' said Abdul Jabbar Khan, who mobilizesdemonstrations of gas victims.   Many of the victims of the disaster live in burlap and cardboardshacks, and were unaware of the settlement because they are too poorto own radios.   Pathak ordered the settlement as the Supreme Court heard UnionCarbide's appeal of an order to pay $166 million in interimcompensation to gas victims and a counter-appeal by the governmentto raise the amount to $233 million.   The interim order was issued April 4, 1988, by the high court incentral India's Madhya Pradesh state, where Bhopal is located.   Union Carbide had argued the order would prejudice the case'soutcome.   It maintained the gas leak was the result of sabotage by adisgruntled employee, and Slack said the company stood by thecontention. The Indian government said the disaster was the resultof negligence.   The disaster produced fierce debate around the world about themoral and legal responsibilities of multinational companies that setup shop in developing countries.   Critics charged that rich corporations from industrial nationsexploit Third World countries. Union Carbide officials complainedprivately that they were hamstrung by local restrictions.   In accordance with Indian law, the Bhopal pesticide plant wasowned by Union Carbide of India Ltd. and operated by local employees.   Efforts to bring the case to trial in the United States wererejected by judges who said they had no jurisdiction.   The case began in the Bhopal District Court and made its waythrough the labyrinthine Indian judiciary, where cases can languishfor years and even decades.   One Bhopal judge was dismissed when it was discovered he wasamong the 500,000 people who filed damage claims. Another judge wasdismissed on grounds he was prejudiced against Union Carbide.   Some of the claimants lived thousands of miles from Bhopal butsaid they suffered mental anguish from worrying about the fate ofloved ones, including railroad passengers whose trains might havebeen near Bhopal at the time of the leak.</TEXT></DOC>
