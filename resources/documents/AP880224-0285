The ministry's Securities and Exchange Council approved anadvisory panel's findings, including a recommendation that insidertrading be made a criminal rather than a civil offense. It proposedthat the offense carry a penalty of up to three years in prison anda fine of up to 3 million yen, or $23,000, ministry officials said.   The panel also called for a revision of Japan's currentsecurities and exchange law to specifically prohibit insidertrading, or the use of inside information about companies to profiton stock markets.   Other recommendations called for an expansion of the ministry'sinvestigation powers and a tightening of the definition of actionsfalling under insider trading laws, the officials said.   Ministry officials now will formulate legislation based on thepanel's recommendations to submit to Japan's parliament, probablythis spring.   Large-scale insider trading is limited in Japan because of theinfrequency of corporate takeovers, analysts say. But leaks ofinformation about company developments to certain investors isbelieved to be frequent, along with stock manipulation by somelarge brokerages, financial sources say.   Japan's markets are dominated by four large securities firms _Nomura, Nikko, Daiwa and Yamaichi _ creating a climate favorable tomarket manipulation.   The advisory panel began forming its recommendations about twomonths ago, after allegations of stock sales by officials at achemical company shortly before it announced bankruptcy, newsreports said.   Implementation of the recommendations will make Japan the lastmajor industrialized country to adopt such regulations, the JapanBroadcasting Corp. (NHK-TV) reported.   The panel said insider trading restrictions should apply toemployees and others inside companies that issue stocks, tounderwriting securities firms, lawyers and certified publicaccountants, and to reporters that have access to sensitiveinformation.   The report also recommended that securities firms be required toreport the stock ownership of large stockholders.   The changes are not likely to take effect before the summer of1989 because of a one-year notice period necessary for thestrengthened criminal penalties, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
