Swiss Justice Ministry spokesman Joerg Kistler said Indiaalleges large payments were made by the Kiel-basedHowaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft to Indian officials via Swissbanks in connection with the submarine deal. He said theIndian request, consisting of about 100 pages, was now beingexamined to see what measures might have to be taken by Swissauthorities.   Last January, accounts in four Swiss banks were orderedfrozen in connection with alleged bribes paid to Indianofficials by Swedish arms maker AB Bofors in the sale ofhowitzers to India.   A Swiss group involved in Third World matters said the newIndian request named more than 30 Swiss banks through whichthe illegal payments, said to total about 40 million Swissfrancs ($28.3 million), were allegedly made in 1981 and 1982in the submarine deal.                                                                                                          TAIWAN'S ELDERLY LAWMAKERS                                                                                                          The elderly members of Taiwan's legislature, who havedominated politics for four decades without having to facere-election, must all retire by the end of 1991, the Councilof Grand Justices ruled. The elderly lawmakers, who numbernearly 800, were elected on the Chinese mainland shortlybefore the Nationalist government lost a civil war tocommunist forces and retreated to Taiwan in 1949. The agingparliamentarians, now mostly in their 70s and 80s, were keptin office to symbolize the Nationalist claim to still be thelegitimate government of China.                                                                                                          AIR FRANCE'S CUTBACK PLANS                                                                                                          Air France plans to cut back flights on some of itsless-traveled routes and take other cost-saving measures inthe face of sluggish traffic growth, Chairman Bernard Attalitold the French business daily La Tribune de l'Expansion. Hewas quoted as saying that the state carrier's traffic roseonly 1.8% during the first five months of 1990, compared witha 4.3% rise in capacity. Included among the cutback plans isa reduction in the number of flights to Algeria and theCaribbean.                                                                                                          JAPANESE RICE                                                                                                          Japan will keep its ban on rice imports because ricefarmers here are &quot;special,&quot; the agriculture minister said.&quot;We have opened the agricultural market, but there is a linebeyond which we cannot pass,&quot; said Tomio Yamamoto, ministerof agriculture, fisheries and forestry. A recent survey of3,000 people by Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper indicatedthat 71% favored easing rice-market controls, up from 41% in1988.                                                                                                          PAPER FOR PRAVDA                                                                                                          Finland's paper exporters are cutting off all shipments tothe Soviet Union because they haven't been paid. The movecould affect publication of the Soviet Communist Party paperPravda and the official government newspaper Izvestia. Thetwo papers' stocks of newsprint have dwindled to a week'ssupply because other Western countries already have stoppedpaper exports to the Soviet Union, the Finnish report said.An official of the Confederation of Finnish Forest Industriessaid the Soviets owe Finnish paper exporters about $22million.                                                                                                          SOVIET-SOUTH KOREAN TIES                                                                                                          The top Soviet official in Seoul said he doesn't expecthis country to begin formal diplomatic relations with SouthKorea in the near future. Valery K. Nazarov, president of theSoviet trade office in Seoul, said there would be &quot;severalsteps to overcome&quot; before establishing ties and indicated theprocess would be complex. His comments contrasted withwidespread speculation among political leaders in Seoul thatties would be established as early as September.
