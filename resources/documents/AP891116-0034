The FDA advised parents who used the kits, marketed by an Idahocompany, to have their children immunized as soon as possible.   The kits were discovered last month during a search by the IdahoState Attorney General's Office at the office, laboratory andhealth food store of J.S. Inc. of Twin Falls, Idaho, and the E.F.Skilling Co. of Buhl, Idaho, a device manufacturer.   J.S. Inc. is the distribution company of James D. Solomon, theFDA said.   Solomon, who was arrested on Idaho state charges, says he is a``naturopath,'' the FDA said. Naturopathy is a method of treatingdiseases with food and exercise to assist the natural healingprocess.   Distribution records indicated kits were sent to naturopaths,parents and regional distributors in Florida, Kansas, Ohio, SouthCarolina, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.</TEXT><NOTE>Petitions Filed to Allow Competition in Local Telephone Access</NOTE><TEXT>   Services</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Metropolitan Fiber Systems Inc. is asking theJustice Department and Federal Communications Commission to allowalternative telecommunications carriers to compete for localtelephone access services.   The regional Bell and other operating companies provide localphone access for all long-distance carriers. Nearly 50 cents ofevery dollar spent on long-distance services goes to the Bellcompanies for access fees, totaling about $20 billion a year.   Anthony J. Pompliano, president of MFS, based in the Chicagosuburb of Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., said Wednesday his company wasasking the Justice Department ``to enforce the Modified FinalJudgment to require that local access ... be `unbundled' to thefullest extent possible to permit fair and equitable competition.''   Also, he said, ``we are asking the FCC to mandate thatalternative local telecommunications carriers can cost-effectivelyinterconnect'' and locate equipment at Bell facilities.   ``That means MFS and similar alternative carriers can installtheir equipment in Bell-owned switch sites and hook up to the usercommunity via the Bell network,'' Pompliano said.   A. Gray Collins, Bell Atlantic senior vice president forexternal affairs, said MFS was ``free to use Bell Atlantic'sservices any way it wants, and it is free to connect its ownnetwork with Bell Atlantic's.''   ``Metropolitan Fiber, however, is demanding more than this. Itis demanding collocation, which is, in effect, the ability to setup their shop in our store. Bell Atlantic has no legal obligationto do this, but it has agreed to meet a number of Metropolitan'srequests,'' Collins said.</TEXT><NOTE>Bush Commends El Salvador's President</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush is expressing solidarity withthe president of El Salvador in the face of a fierce guerrillaattack that has left upwards of 500 people dead and more than 1,000wounded.
