Great Valley Corporate Center 40Valley Stream Parkway Malvern, Pa.andP;  19355 (215) 251-9890 List price: $295 +Inexpensive; fun to use; innovative 3-D Box and Spyro Polygon tools; goodprice/performance ratio.andP;  - Detailed but uninspiring black-and-white manual;no color-separation features.andM;Cricket ColorPaint is like a kaleidoscope, that mirrored tube with coloredshapes inside that form intriguing designs at every turn.andP;  People who retainan exploring, childlike curiosity will find the program fascinating timeafter time.andP;  Others will give it a whirl a few times but may soon tire of it.andM;Features.andP;  Cricket ColorPaint shares about 90 percent of its features withthe numerous (maybe too numerous) eight-bit color paint programs available inthe Macintosh market.andP;  Its interface is fairly well laid out and offers allthe tools needed to complete drawings, including selection tools, fill tools,brush and spray tools, and a surprisingly large array of primitives.andP;  Thislast group not only contains the obligatory rectangle, polygon and oval, butalso arcs, hyperpolygons, triangles, parallel polygons and some exoticrotated shapes.andM;The creators of the program put an impressive amount of innovation into allthis, mainly in how the tools can be configured and customized throughdouble-clicking and Command-key equivalents.andP;  The Water Drop Smear tool, forexample, doubles as a brush, a slider or a smoothing tool; the Double LinePolygon can be set to create multiple parallel lines at any offset; the Pentool can be used to draw Bezier curves, and the list goes on.andM;Two features in Cricket ColorPaint merit special mention: the 3-D Box andSpyro Polygon tools.andP;  The former automatically creates 3-D boxes that changeshape in perspective as they are dragged around the screen.andP;  The latterenables anyone to create &quot;spiders from Mars&quot; or exciting kaleidoscopiceffects.andM;Cricket ColorPaint's text-handling capabilities are comprehensive andimpressive.andP;  The program allows patterns inside characters and can createframes around text automatically.andM;The documentation is thorough, but it is only in black and white and is notvery well designed.andP;  While color printing is expensive, a color paint programreally needs some color illustrations in the manual.andP;  We'd like to seeCricket remedy this deficiency.andM;Fresh Paint.andP;  Paint programs are often judged by their color controlfeatures.andP;  Cricket ColorPaint's controls are adequate but not outstandingwhen compared with competing products.andP;  ColorPaint offers graduated colorsand different transparency levels in a basic form, but blends of more thantwo colors or at a proportional base are not possible.andP;  On the other hand, afeature called Fresh Paint is a real attention grabber.andM;When an object or line is first created, it appears with handles around it toindicate that it is not yet a part of the total image (it is &quot;fresh paint&quot;).andO;At this point the user can make alterations and, when satisfied with theresults, click outside the object to merge it with the rest of the bit-mappedimage.andM;While this feature is handy, it only keeps the item separate temporarily andaffects only one item at a time.andP;  some high-end packages offer a number ofbuffers or layers to keep images separate; both are preferable solutions.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Of course comparisons with very high-end applications are notfair because Cricket ColorPaint is aimed at the mainstream paint market.andO;Features such as 24- or 32-bit capability, video input/output, colorseparation and advanced color controls, which are hallmarks of the high endof the spectrum, are not to be found here.andM;In the large field of mainstream eight-bit color paint programs, CricketColorPaint could be the application of choice if the price/performance ratiois a major factor.andP;  Otherwise, other color painting applications provide morefeatures.andP;  What Cricket ColorPaint does offer is a solid, reasonably pricedtool for people who have the inclination to dress up memos, newsletters andthe like with colorful pictures.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
