The official, Carlyle Guerra de Macedo, told an internationalconference on ``Democracy and Health'' on Tuesday that healthconditions in the region had worsened in the 1980s.   Some 170 million people in Latin American are denied basicnutrition and health care, and more than 40 million live incritical poverty, he said.   Although the region spent $45 billion on medical care, anestimated 30 percent of the money was wasted or wrongly spent,Guerra de Macedo said.   ``This we owe to our incapacity to efficiently use healthservices,'' he said. ``Disorganization in medical care centers haspredominated.''   Government representatives from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Cuba were participatingin the three-day conference.</TEXT></DOC>
