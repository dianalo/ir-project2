Botha said Wednesday.   Botha told a news conference U.N. military observers monitoringNamibia's transition from South African rule to independencereported the incursions from Angola in radio messages to each otherand were too frightened to intervene. The U.N. force denied it.   Leaders of the South-West Africa People's Organization, whichfought a 23-year bush war for independence, said none of theirguerrillas were crossing the border. SWAPO is expected to get themost votes in a five-day election starting Tuesday for seats in anassembly that will draft a constitution.   A statement from the U.N. Transition Assistance Group releasedat U.N. headquarters in New York and in Windhoek, Namibia, said:``It has been established that the messages do not emanate from anyUNTAG source.   ``It continues to be the case that UNTAG is unable to confirmallegations that SWAPO PLAN combatants are present in southernAngola.''   PLAN refers to the SWAPO fighting force, the People's LiberationArmy of Namibia.   Chief U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani told reporters in NewYork that Botha telephoned Secretary-Geneeral Javier Perez deCuellar ``to inform the secretary-general of his allegations.''   Botha said in Pretoria that members of his staff interceptedmessages from U.N. observers mentioning the infiltration of vehicleconvoys and more than 600 guerrillas from Oct. 23 through Tuesday.   ``Unless this is resolved within days, the South Africangovernment is reserving the right to take whatever steps would berequired to ensure that all parties comply with theirobligations,'' he told the news conference. ``The South Africansecurity forces have been put on alert.''   Andimba Toivo Ja Toivo, secretary-general of SWAPO, said Botha'sassertion was ``another concoction by the South African governmentin a bid to sabotage the election.''   ``It is well known that the South African government sends itsown troops dressed in other armies' clothing when it wishes tofabricate an offensive maneuver by an army that has laid down itsarms,'' he said.   Botha said the intercepted messages ``made it clear that SWAPOwarned the UNTAG patrols they they shouldn't interfere or theywould be shot. The tendency of UNTAG is that they are wishing toevacuate, to run.''   He said UNTAG ``is certainly not doing its job; it is frightenedto do it properly where SWAPO is involved.''   ``If this threat cannot be removed and if these activitiescontinue, then there cannot be a free and fair election,'' theforeign minister declared. ``We decided to reveal this in anattempt to stop this and to save the process, to save theelections.''   The guerrillas had bases in Angola during the long guerrillawar, but are not supposed to have armed personnel in Namibia ornear the border during the transition. South Africa also withdrewits troops from the territory.   On April 1, the official start of the transitional period, SouthAfrica said hundreds of guerrillas had crossed the border. SouthAfrica received U.N. permission to deploy its troops, and about 280guerrillas and 27 members of the security forces were killed.   South Africa captured Namibia from Germany in World War I andgoverned it under a League of Nations mandate. The United Nationsended the mandate in 1966, but South Africa refused to leave.   In December, it signed agreements with Angola and Cuba underwhich the U.N. independence plan would be accompanied by withdrawalof the 50,000 Cuban soldiers stationed in Angola.</TEXT></DOC>
