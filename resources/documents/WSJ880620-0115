United, a unit of UAL Corp., said the Japanese carrier refuses to let United's Apollo computer reservations system issue tickets for travel on Japan Air Lines. A spokesman said this makes United's system, which has just 600 terminals in Japan, much less attractive to Japanese travel agents.    The U.S. carrier said in a statement that this &quot;enables JAL to preserve its CRS monopoly in Japan by maintaining a highly effective barrier against entry by more sophisticated U.S. CRS systems.&quot;    The action comes as competition between airlines' computer reservations systems heats up around the globe. Two competing groups of airlines are battling to establish new reservations systems in Europe. In the U.S., Texas Air Corp.'s computer reservations unit has filed anti-trust suits against both United and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, which operates the Sabre reservations system.    United is the third largest carrier between Japan and the U.S., after JAL and the Northwest Airlines unit of NWA Inc.    United said Japan Air Lines is able to sell tickets of U.S. carriers on its computer reservations system. Its spokesman said the complaint asks the U.S. Department of Transportation to prohibit the issuance of JAL tickets in the U.S. if the carrier doesn't settle the issue.    Apollo is the second largest computer reservations system in the U.S., behind Sabre. In May, United agreed to sell a half interest in Apollo to four European airlines and USAir Group Inc. for nearly $500 million. The Transportation Department is currently reviewing that transaction. </TEXT></DOC>
