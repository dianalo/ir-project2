The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it also is starting a full-scale investigation of health and safety conditions at the company's San Diego shipyard, where the accident occurred. National Steel andamp; Shipbuilding is a subsidiary of Morrison-Knudsen Corp., Boise, Idaho.    OSHA cited the shipbuilder for 19 violations of federal safety rules, including seven willful violations. The agency defines a willful safety violation as one in which an employer knew of an unsafe workplace condition that violated federal requirements, or was aware that a hazardous condition existed but didn't make a reasonable effort to correct it.    In the accident last July 10, the 12 construction workers were being lifted onto a naval vessel in a steel basket suspended from an industrial crane. That violated federal safety rules, which require the use of gangways to carry workers on and off ships. The basket slipped from the crane and fell 30 feet to the deck of the vessel, OSHA said.    &quot;We feel we can prove that (the company's) . . . failure to provide gangways, and permitting employees to be transported in a steel basket suspended from a crane constitute willful violations of two federal safety standards,&quot; said John Hermanson, OSHA's San Diego office director. The agency said it was unable to determine why the basket fell, however.    The nature of the 19 violations and the company's general high injury rate &quot;necessitate a wall-to-wall inspection of the shipyard,&quot; Mr. Hermanson said.    OSHA said it found that for each 100 employees, the shipyard had an annual rate of 18.3 injuries causing lost workdays, compared with an average of 4.2 such injuries per 100 workers for all U.S. manufacturing companies.    In addition to using the crane to lift the workers, the company's other willful violations included allowing a colorblind worker to operate the crane, which has color-coded controls, and making unapproved crane modifications, OSHA said. Other violations included failure to test and inspect crane parts, permitting unguarded moving parts on the crane, and having electrical hazards and improper guard rails on the access to the crane, the agency said.    The company has 15 working days either to accept the OSHA findings, pay the penalties and correct the alleged hazards, or to contest the ruling before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.    In Boise, a Morrison-Knudsen spokesman said the company's National Steel andamp; Shipbuilding unit &quot;has a strong safety program and its overall safety record is better than the industry average.&quot; He added that a &quot;review is under way&quot; on whether the company will contest the ruling. The company declined any elaboration. </TEXT></DOC>
