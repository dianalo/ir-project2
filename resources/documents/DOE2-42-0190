Estimated reserves of only 37 bcf make the field the smallest offshoregas development in Europe. Economic development of such a small reservedemanded the innovative use of proven technology. Minimum facilitiescompatible with safe and efficient operations were designed. An unmannedplatform with free water knock-out, glycol injection and a sphere launcher,feeds gas via a pipeline beneath the coastal dunes to a dedicated onshoreprocessing terminal. A rigorous search for cost reductions during pre-projectand project engineering, coupled with the favourable economic climatewhich the Netherlands provides, led to the viability of this most marginalof field developments. Several lessons were learned from Q/8-A developmentproject. A minimum cost development with a short project schedule demandsa tightly defined technical statement of requirements. Do not underestimatethe level of detailed effort necessary to develop and to operate thesmallest of reserves.</TEXT></DOC>
