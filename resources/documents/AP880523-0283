On other markets, rain-related selling sent cotton futuressharply lower; precious metals posted strong gains; energy futuresretreated; livestock and meat were mixed; and stock-index futureswere lower.   Soybean futures took the hardest hit among the grains, with mostcontracts off more than 20 cents a bushel at the closing bell.Prices had skyrocketed in the previous two weeks due to extremelydry weather during the planting season.   Some spots in the western Corn Belt received more than threeinches of rain of rain over the weekend.   ``This is obviously just a continuation of a very emotionalmarket and, I think, a forebearer of things to come,'' said TedMao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.``I think there is uncertainty not only about the weather but aboutfinal acreage as well, and the market will have to sort itselfout.''   Joel Karlin, an analyst in Chicago with Research DepartmentInc., said many traders decided to take profits ahead of theafternoon release of the National Weather Service's six-to-10-dayforecast. But the market's sentiment remained ``extremelypositive,'' he said.   The closely watched six-to-10-day outlook called for most of theUnited States east of the Mississippi to receive below-normalrainfall during the first half of next week.   After the close, the Agriculture Department reported soybeanplanting was 62 percent complete as of Sunday. Corn planting was 95percent finished and cotton planting was 71 percent done.   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 7 cents lower with the contract fordelivery in July at $3.42} a bushel; corn was 5 cents to 7\ centslower with July at $2.15{ a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 3\ centslower with July at $1.70} a bushel; soybeans were 19 cents to 21{cents lower with July at $7.57{ a bushel.   Weekend rains also dampened the enthusiasm for cotton futures onthe New York Cotton Exchange, where the December contract fell 2cents a pound, the limit allowed for daily trading.   Like soybean prices, cotton prices have soared in recent weeksas dry weather dominated the planting season.   But ``the upward move was largely exaggerated,'' said ErnestSimon, cotton specialist in New York with Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc.   Cotton settled .83 cent to 2 cents lower with July at 65.55cents a pound.   Surging platinum led the precious metals market, which showedsurprising strength in the face of tumbling grain and oil prices.   Platinum was buoyed by overseas buying, particularly from theMiddle East and Japan, analysts said.   In South Africa, a leader of the opposition political partyurged a boycott on exports of certain ``strategic materials,''including platinum, to the United States if Congress approvestougher economic sanctions against South Africa. That action alsosupported platinum prices, analysts said.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum settled $17.30 to$17.90 higher with July at $585.90 a troy ounce.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $4.10 to$5.10 higher with June at $462.80 a troy ounce; silver was 4.5cents to 4.9 cents higher with May at $6.738 a troy ounce.   Energy futures slipped on the New York Mercantile Exchange. WestTexas Intermediate crude oil settled 21 cents to 35 cents lowerwith July at $17.35 a barrel; heating oil was .51 cent to .88 centlower with June at 46.91 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .24cent to .92 cent lower with June at 51.44 cents a gallon.   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in a quiet sessionon the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.   Cattle prices fell on fears of a drop in wholesale beef pricesand ideas that cash cattle prices were nearing a seasonal peak,said Philip Stanley, an analyst in Chicago with Thomson McKinnonSecurities Inc.   Hog futures also were pressured by fears of lower cash prices.Frozen pork bellies finished mixed, with technical factorssupporting the near-term contracts, Stanley said.   Live cattle settled .10 cent to .72 cent lower with June at72.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .20 cent lowerwith May at 80.90 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent to .37 centlower with June at 53.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were.25 cent lower to .77 cent higher with May at 54.02 cents a pound.
