Western scientists agree that the compounds, used inrefrigeration, air conditioning, aerosols and fast-food packaging,are destroying the ozone shield that protects the Earth from thesun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.   They say the compounds are responsible for creating an ozone holeroughly the size of the continental United States over the Antarcticevery winter.   An international team of scientists this winter also foundevidence of ozone depletion over the Arctic, but said it couldn'tyet prove a link in the region with the compounds.   Zhakarov, chairman of the Soviet committee on ozone protection,said Soviet scientists have found evidence of a 25 percent ozonedepletion over parts of Europe and the western Soviet Union, but hesaid it was due primarily to naturally occurring cyclones.   ``This process is cyclical and this cycle is 10-15 days, and itwas observed in February and in January of this year,'' he said.   The Soviet Union is one of 31 signatories to the 1987 MontrealProtocol, which calls for halving production of the compounds by theend of the century. Six more agreed Sunday to abide by its terms _Austria, Hungary, Malaysia, athe Philippines, Trinidad and Zambia.   The United States and the European Economic Community have saidthey want to ban the chemicals by that time.   Zhakarov said ``if there is proved scientific date that we shouldphase out those substances, we will support this idea ... not allthe countries support the appeal of the EEC. We must be verycautious here. If we take a decision which is not well grounded, wecan interfere and destroy the economies of the developingcountries.''   Liz Cook, ozone campaign chairman of the environmental groupFriends of the Earth-USA, said the Soviets ``have presented a fairlyconfusing position ... I think what they'd like to do is just buythemselves a little time before they have to commit to a policy ...The science is clearly there.''   China's delegate called for the establishment of an internationalfund to protect the ozone layer, to be supported mainly by theindustrialized countries.   Liu Ming Pu, China's environmental commissioner, said theindustrialized countries had done most of the damage. He said thedeveloped world produced 80 percent of all the compounds, whileChina produced less than 2 percent.   He also proposed that substitutes for the compounds be providedat no cost to developing countries.   No substitutes the compounds are available for sale, but industryofficials say they hope to have some on the market by the mid-1990s.   The compounds can last 100 years, but when they reach thestratosphere, about 15-25 miles above the earth's surface, theybreak apart and their chlorine atoms destroy ozone.   The compounds also trap heat and warm the Earth's surface, aprocess known as the greenhouse effect, which could cause majorclimate changes.</TEXT></DOC>
