The proposals contained in this Notice may be changedin light of the comments received.  Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic,environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submittedwill be available, both before and after the closing date for comments,in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizingeach FAA/public contact, concerned with the substance of this proposal,will be filed in the Rules Docket.  Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitedin response to this Notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped post cardon which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 89-NM-93-AD.''The post card will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion   </ITAG>The Direction Generale de L'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthinessauthority of France, in accordance with existing provisions of a bilateralairworthiness agreement, has notified the FAA of an unsafe condition whichmay exist on Airbus Model A300 series airplanes. There has been one reportof non-extension of both main landing gears in the free-fall mode. Furtherinvestigation revealed that bearings, Part Number NSA 8116-16, installedon the right MLG uplock control bellcrank support, were jammed; this preventedany movement of the control rods and resulted in the failure of the MLGto extend. This condition, if not corrected, could result in the inabilityto extend the MLG following a failure of the normal extend mode.  Airbus Industrie has issued All Operator Telex (AOT) 32/88/02, Issue 2,dated December 14, 1988, which describes procedures for a one-time inspectionof the right and left main landing gears (MLG) for defective bearings,and replacement of the bearings, if necessary. The DGAC has classifiedthe All Operators Telex (AOT) as mandatory, and has issued French AirworthinessDirective 89-040-091(B) addressing this subject.  This airplane model is manufactured in France and type certificated inthe United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the FederalAviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design registered in the United States, this action proposesto require a one-time inspection of the MLG for defective bearings, andreplacement of the bearings, if necessary, in accordance with the AOT previouslydescribed.  It is estimated that 66 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected bythis AD, that it would take approximately 5 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost would be $40 permanhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S.operators is estimated to be $13,200.  The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draftevaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket.A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation, Aviation safety, Safety.  <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]  </ITAG>1.
