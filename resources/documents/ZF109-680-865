 This paper addresses data and informationrequirements and the flow of data and information across business processes,along with how business modeling has been used to develop requirements fornew computer-based systems that in turn support the data and informationneeds of businesses.andP;  In addition, business modeling can be performed at bothhigher, or general, levels and at lower, more detailed levels.andP;  The focus ofthis paper is on the higher levels of modeling and can be seen in the contextof AD/Cycle&quot; as enterprise modeling in Figure 1.andM;An additional valuable approach to understanding the context and role thatbusiness/enterprise modeling plays may be obtained from the framework forinformation systems architecture formulated by John Zachman,' as depicted inFigure 2.andP;  Business modeling would fit in the following components ofZachman's framework:andM;* Scope description (ballpark view)andM;*  List of entitiesandM;*  List of processesandM;* Model of the business (owner's view)andM;*  Entity-relationship diagramandM;*  Functional flow diagramandM;* Model of the information system (designer's view)andM;*  Data model (entity-relationship)andM;*  Data flow diagramandM;Copyright 1990 by international Business Machines Corporation.andP;

 Higher-level modelingfocuses on the scope description and model of the business perspectives,whereas a lower, or more detailed, level of modeling focuses on the model ofthe information system perspective.andM;The scope of this paper is to report on modeling experiences with which theauthor was personally involved.andP;  The methodologies and tools (now calledcomputer-aided software engineering, or CASE, tools), especially theInformation System Model and Architecture Generator (ISMOD),' have beensuccessfully used with over 450 IBM customers during the past 10 years,ranging across the entire spectrum of large enterprises.andP;  Enterprises usingthis approach include all kinds; some examples are schools, aerospacemanufacturers, airlines, governmental agencies, the military, oil companies,automobile manufacturers, steel manufacturers, insurance companies, andbanks.andP;  The approach can therefore be said to be universal and not limited toany one kind of industrial genre.andM;Customer participants.andP;  The IBM customers who performed business/enterprisemodeling studies, and with which the author was personally involved, follow:andM;* One of the three largest airlines in the U.S.andM;* One of the three largest commercial and retail banks in the U.S.andM;* One of the largest electric utilities in ArizonaandM;* One of the largest electric utilities in MichiganandM;* A major electric utility providing most of the power to one of the largestcities in Pennsylvania, focusing on nuclear power sourcesandM;* One of the largest electric utilities in Pennsylvania, focusing on nuclearpower sourcesandM;* One of the world's largest multinational grain shippers and tradersandM;* A multinational, U.S.-based insurance company with the reputation of beingone of the best-managed and aggressive companies of its kindandM;* A multinational U.S.andP;  oil company currently included in the top 50 of theFortune 500 industrial listings.andM;Purposes of studies.andP;  The business reasons for seven of the customer studiesrelated to the need for creating tactical and strategic computer supportplans.andP;  All of these companies realized that their major systems wereimplemented at least five years earlier, and new applications were beinginstalled with no thought given to the overall picture.andP;  They were sure thatthey needed to review their current status, assess any shortcomings, and putin place plans to ensure that they would have adequate support to handlefuture requirements in addition to capitalizing on new technology.andM;The results of these seven studies were, therefore, focused on proposedcomputer systems and improvements.andP;  Business/enterprise modeling was used asa disciplined way of identifying current computer support, lack of computersupport, and potential new applications.andM;Two other studies were conducted for different reasons.andP;  One reason wascomputer availability.andP;  In this case, an IBM customer had most of theircomputer support located in a single physical location, and they wereconcerned about the effects on their operations if a natural disaster, suchas an earthquake, were to occur.andP;  They were interested, therefore, inbusiness/enterprise modeling and in doing simulations to determine whether ornot they could distribute their business processes and the associatedcomputer support and software applications to four or more disparate computersites.andP;  The customer knew that the disparate computer sites would interactwith each other with regard to applications and databases, andbusiness/enterprise modeling was used to determine whether or not distributeddata processing of applications and data would be feasible.andM;Another study involving business/enterprise modeling was triggered by an IBMCUstomer's increasing already-high-volume workload and the fear that theirrequirements would eventually exceed the performance capabilities of thelargest iBm computers.andP;  Their use of business/enterprise modeling was alsogeared toward determining the feasibility of distributing their processingfrom one mainframe computer to two or more mainframes, while stillcommunicating with each other in real time to ensure that the data in all ofthe mainframes would be synchronized.andM;Key aspects of the studiesandM;The cited business/enterprise modeling studies incorporated the followinglist of dimensions and concepts.andP;  The full analytical underpinnings of themethodologies utilized in the studies are contained in the documents listedat the end of this paper.andM;* Business processesandM;* EntitiesandM;* AttributesandM;* Data viewsandM;* Data qualifiersandM;* Data criticismsandM;* OrganizationsandM;* Physical locationsandM;* Events or triggersandM;* RepositoriesandM;* Analytical methods for feasibility of distribution of processes and dataandM;Compelling business reasons.andP;  Important aspects of these studies that cannotbe overemphasized to potential business/enterprise modeling practitioners aredollars spent and dollars saved, urgent and identifiable business problemsneeding solutions, and the perspective of the business person regardingimmediate and direct payback from any business/enterprise modeling activity.andM;The meaning and context of &quot;dollars spent and dollars saved&quot; have to do withthe outlook of a business person (i.e., businesses exist solely to make moneyand profit).andP;  This statement may seem to some to be a platitude, but seven ofthe nine business/enterprise modeling studies that are reflected in thispaper had this aspect as the first and foremost study goal.andP;  Each of themodeling studies produced a final report, and the most important section ineach of these reports dealt with the cost to implement a new computer systemand the direct dollar savings that could be attributed to these new systems.andM;Business/enterprise modeling activities per se were viewed only as adjunctsto the goal of dollars saved.andP;  The businesses had already intuitively sensedthat new systems and applications were needed.andP;  They were at a point wherethey were ready to obtain a higher degree of rigor and discipline to validatetheir systems and application requirements.andP;  These businesses were,therefore, primed and receptive to some kind of outside review of theirsituation by a consultant, whether from IBM or elsewhere.andM;When IBM offered to provide a business/enterprise perspective of theircurrent status, this kind of modeling approach was accepted.andP;  This approachmight be compared to requesting and receiving a second medical opinion toensure that the right decision is made.andM;The notion of an urgent and pressing business problem needing a solutionrelates to two of the IBM customers already mentioned.andP;  One, an airline,concerned that its transaction volume would exceed the performancecapabilities Of IBM'S largest computers, wanted to investigate thefeasibility of off-loading their reservations applications to one or moredistributed processors.andP;  They therefore opted to build a business model oftheir reservations system to see if distributed processing was a viableapproach.andM;The second customer, a large bank, was concerned about the exposure of havingall of its processing requirements located at a single physical site, in theevent that a natural disaster should occur.andP;  They also used modeling todetermine the feasibility of dispersing their nightly processing to two ormore distributed processors.andM;Payback from modeling activities is directly related to the focus of themodeling studies on the return-on-investment aspect of the studyrecommendations (i.e., cost and benefit analysis).andP;  Modeling was viewed as asupport activity leading to the identification of another way to save moneyfor the business.andP;  Bridge from business/enterprise modeling toimplementation.andP;  Over time, it has become evident that it would be desirableto be able to use the information gathered in the modeling activity duringthe subsequent implementation phases.andP;  Until the advent of AD/Cycle it wasdifficult to do this.andP;  Using DevelopMate-, it is now possible to take theresults of the business/enterprise modeling activity and use those results toprototype and validate the application and data architecture views.andP;  That is,one may take the following approach:andM;* Perform business/enterprise modeling at the highest level of an enterpriseto obtain the information requirements at that perspectiveandM;* Prioritize the sequence of applications to be developed as determined bythe enterprise-level studyandM;* Use the results of the enterprise-level modeling study and DevelopMate todecompose the business process and data to the level where prototyping can beused to validate the rigor of design and user satisfactionandM;Noteworthy is the exact correspondence of many of the dimensions used in thecited business/enterprise modeling studies and the dimensions used byDevelopMate  and the Repository Manager (See Figures 3, 4, and 5 for theISMOD enterprise model-process and data, the enterprise process model portionof the IBM-supplied meta model, and the enterprise data model portion of theIBM-supplied meta model, respectively.)andM;Excerpts from a customer studyandM;Much of this section was excerpted from an actual customerbusiness/enterprise modeling study to provide a realistic and pragmaticperspective of how IBM customers view business/enterprise modeling.andP;  Nameshave been omitted and changed to protect customer confidentiality.andO;Especially noteworthy in this customer study are terms such as integratedsystem architecture, business processes, data views, events, locations, andorganizations.andP;  These terms (dimensions) are equivalent to many of the terms(dimensions) used by DevelopMate.andP;  (See Figures 4 and 5 for the enterpriseprocess model and the enterprise data model of the IBM-supplied AD/CycleRepository Manager.)andM;Table of contents example.andP;  Below is listed an excerpted table of contentsfrom the customer study.andP;  Note that the business/enterprise modeling studymethodology is relegated to Appendix F (Item 12), and the real businessaspects of the study are in the forefront of the document.andM;1 .Executive SummaryandM;2.andP;

 Appendix F: MethodologyandM;Executive summary.andP;  At the end of the study the following executive summarywas provided:andM;Company President J. Jones commissioned anandM;analysis of the enterprise's business informationandM;needs.andP;  This analysis was performed during theandM;period of April 4 through June 3, 1988, by a study organization consisting ofrepresentatives of our company, IBM, and representatives from two otheroutside consulting organizations.andM;IBM Information System Model and Architecture Generator (ISMOD) Was themethod used for the analysis.andP;  Through ISMOD, business processes performed tomanage business resources and the data used by those business processes wereidentified.andP;  Simulation capabilities of the model allowed a measure of theimpact a change in a business process could have in terms of usersatisfaction.andP;  Existing management studies were factored into the analysis.andM;The results and recommendations contained in the Plan are the professionalopinions of the study team, based upon the research conducted during thenine-week study.andP;  The Plan provides the observed opportunities to improvebusiness processes, recommendations to implement improvements, and a proposedintegrated system architecture that enhances the information resources withassociated costs, benefits, and schedule.andP;  Detailed design of the finalsystem configuration with refinements to cost and schedule will need to beaccomplished if the Plan is implemented.andP;  It is the team's belief, however,that the Plan's analysis bounds the cost and benefits resulting from thePlan's detailed design implementation.andM;Methodology.andP;  In order to analyze information flow, the processes within thecompany had to be clearly defined and understood.andP;  Since no one person isknowledgeable about all business processes, interviews with a number of keyindividuals were required to define all of the processes of the company.andO;Prior to conducting these interviews, the study team reviewed and organizedthe business processes of the company.andP;  The resulting business process listwould be modified by the interview phase of the study until a complete andaccurate list had evolved.andP;  Business processes were organized in thefollowing format:andM;Business functionandM;BUSINESS SYSTEMandM;ProcessandM;SubprocessandM;Sub-subprocessandM;This five-tier hierarchy was important because it allowed the processes to beorganized by the nature of the information they contained rather than by thephysical organization of a plant department or the personnel who performed ina process.andM;Business functions can be thought of as those resources that exist to satisfythe mission, goals, and objectives of a business.andP;  Seven business functionswere identified for the company.andP;  Business systems are those systems thatmanage each particular business function.andP;  Twenty-four business systems wereidentified.andP;  Each of the business systems is supported by a number ofprocesses, subprocesses, and subsubprocesses.andP;  Following is a list of thebusiness function and business system organization:andM;1.andP;  Production Operations Maintenance Materials and serviceandM;2.andP;  Administration Payroll Cashiering Accounts payable Document controlandM;3.andP;  Management Commitments Quality control PerformanceandM;4.andP;  Legal Environment Licensing Security Quality assuranceandM;5.andP;  PersonnelandM;6.andP;  Engineering Modifications Controls SuppliesandM;7.andP;  Planning Budget ScheduleandM;The business systems named above are not physical departments of the companyorganization.andP;  They are business systems that are independent of companyorganization and that may cross several department boundaries.andP;  The businessprocesses grouped by any business system may be performed by any companyindividual, regardless of his or her department affiliation.andP;  This means thatany future company reorganization will have little effect on how the currentinformation flow is defined, or on the final proposed integrated design.andO;Once the business processes were defined, the flow of information throughthese processes had to be examined.andP;  All business processes use raw data insome form to produce an output.andP;  This combination of data to representsomething useful in the execution of a process is called a data view.andP;  A dataview is a physical grouping of elementary data in a form that can be viewedby people.andP;  Examples of data views are invoices, reports, memos, computerscreens, conversations, and forms.andP;  Business processes, in almost all cases,use data views as input, and they create output data views, which are sent toother business processes.andP;  Therefore, an evaluation of specific data viewswill provide a measure of the flow of information in business processes.andM;One of the greatest benefits from interviewing key individuals was theirevaluation of the data views they use.andP;  Prior to the interviews, the studyteam prepared a list of data views to be used as a starting point for theinterviewees.andP;  This list, like the process list, evolved through theinterview phase.andP;  Interviews.andP;  Interviews were conducted with key individualsknowledgeable about the business processes in which they are involved and thedata needed to perform these processes.andP;  These individuals were selected torepresent the processes of the 24 business systems.andP;  After this selection, across check was made of the company's organizational chart to ensure that alllevels of management and all functional departments were represented.andM;Once selected, individuals to be interviewed were organized into groups ofthree or four so that they would both enhance and restrain group discussions.andO;Interviews lasted from six to eight hours and consisted of the followingthree parts:andM;1.andP;  Identification-All interviewees were identified by a unique code, bytheir physical location within the company, and by their interview number.andM;2.andP;  Process identification-With use of a prepared business process list as astarting point, all interviewees were asked to identify all of the processesas they performed them.andP;  In most cases, several interviewees indicated thatthey used the same process.andP;  On a group basis, each interview sessionidentified about 50 to 100 processes.andP;  Individually, each intervieweeidentified between 15 and 25 processes he or she performed.andP;  Each intervieweethen coded each process he or she performed on a process form.andP;  Theinterviewees also indicated the frequency with which they performed theprocess by indicating an event code.andM;3.andP;  Data view identification-Using the prepared data view list, intervieweeswere asked to identify all of the data views that they used.andP;  After theprepared list was exhausted, the group of interviewees identified all otherdata views that they used by brainstorming.andP;  Typically, each interview groupidentified approximately 100 data views, although some groups identified over200.andP;  Each interviewee then coded each data view that he or she used on a&quot;data form.&quot;andM;Data evaluation.andP;  The data form allowed the interviewees to qualify andcriticize each data view individually.andP;  Nine data qualifiers were developedby the study team and placed on the data form.andP;  These were:andM;1.andP;  Essential data: Is this data view vital to the business processes ortasks being performed?andM;2.andP;  Copied: Are the data duplicated material, rekeyed, or manually recordedfrom another source?andM;3.andP;  Text: Are the data written, typed, or printed material not from acomputer?andM;4.andP;  Graphics: Is the data view a chart of any kind?andM;5.andP;  Drawings: Is the data view a blueprint or drawing of any type?andM;6.andP;  Microform: Is the data view reproduced on microfilm, slides, or photos?andM;7.andP;  Computer output: Is the information obtained from a computer printout orread from a terminal?andM;8.andP;  Real time required: Are the data rapidly changing, and must the data bekept current?andM;9.andP;  Not formalized: Is the information received by telephone, word of mouth,or any other informal source?andM;Seven data criticisms were developed by the study team.andP;  These criticismswere the measuring tool that the computer model used to determine the qualityof specific data views.andP;  They are as follows:andM;1.andP;  Accessibility: Are the data difficult or time-consuming to access?andM;2.andP;  Clarity: Are the data difficult to understand or interpret?andM;3.andP;  Accuracy: Is there any doubt about the accuracy of the data?andM;4.andP;  Timeliness: Do you receive the data late?andM;5.andP;  Completeness: Are data missing.?andM;6.andP;  Legibility: Are the data difficult to read?andM;7.andP;  Excessive: Are there useless or redundant data?andM;Business/enterprise model.andP;  After the interviews were completed, informationcontained in the process and in the data forms was coded and entered intoISMOD.andP;  ISMOD allows a number of reports to be generated and sorted by anyone of these five dimensions: the interviewee, the hierarchy (department),the process, the data view, or the origin (process that creates the dataview).andM;Many reports are useful in designing an integrated systems architecture.andP;  Thestatistics reports are very useful in determining problems associated withthe current information system.andP;  They present the interview data insummarized form and show the satisfaction index.andM;The satisfaction index was computed by dividing the number of satisfiedresponses (no criticisms) by the total number of interviewee usages.andO;Therefore, if a data view was never criticized, its satisfaction index wouldbe I.O.andP;  The statistics report also printed out any or all of the dataqualifiers and criticisms.andP;  This information provided insight as to why agiven business process or data view had a low satisfaction index.andM;Another ISMOD report useful in diagnosing the current information system wasthe initial matrix.andP;  This report presented the interview data in matrix formshowing two dimensions on the axis.andP;  Each intersection on the matrix has fourentries associated with it.andP;  It showed the number of satisfactory usages, thenumber of unsatisfactory usages, the total number of usages, and thesatisfaction index.andP;  When this report was run with the dimensions businessprocess and data view, it showed all of the data views used by a businessprocess and all of the business processes using a particular data view, alongwith the usage and satisfaction calculations.andM;Since the statistics report was useful in acquiring an overall understandingof the usage of data in information systems, it was logically the firstreport executed.andP;  Statistics reports were generated with business processes,data views, and hierarchies as single dimensions on the row axis andqualifiers or criticisms on the column axis.andP;  As suspect business processeswith low satisfaction indexes were identified, an initial matrix withbusiness processes and data views was generated.andP;  This was the extent towhich the model was used to identify problems.andM;Integrated solution.andP;  The earlier subsection on methodology describes how acomputer model was used to analyze the information derived from theinterviews of the company's personnel.andP;  The results of this analysis were anumber of opportunities for improvement that were categorized intoimprovement opportunities.andM;From the improvement categories, major needs and their correspondingindividual solutions were defined.andP;  At this point, it was recognized thatappreciably more benefits were possible by using an integrated solutionrather than implementing each individual solution independently.andP;  Thefollowing describes how this was done.andM;Cluster formation.andP;  The ISMOD computer model was used to build a matrix thatidentified business processes that use data views versus those that createdata views.andP;  This effort helped build 18 business, or tactical, clusters.andP;  Atactical cluster is a functional area that uses a large amount of the datathat it creates.andP;  The flow of data from these clusters was then analyzed toidentify the business process at the central site that feeds data to otherbusiness processes.andP;  Once the flow of data was clear, simulations were run onthe tactical clusters to identify data that, if improved, would have thegreatest impact on the organization.andP;  From this diagnosis, ideas werediscussed on how to improve the way these critical data could be presentedfor use with an integrated approach.andP;  The integrated architecture buildingblocks evolved from this process.andM;Needs and individual solutions were then grouped under the tactical clustersand checked against the building blocks to ensure that the proposedintegrated solution provided the same functionality that had been provided bythe individual solutions.andM;Tactical projects.andP;  To implement this integrated solution, the tacticalclusters were divided into discrete projects.andP;  Upwards of 50 tacticalprojects were identified from 13 of the 18 tactical clusters.andP;  The selectedtactical projects were deemed sufficient to develop an integrated informationstrategic plan, and, when implemented, would satisfy the major informationneeds of all 18 tactical clusters.andM;Data satisfaction metricandM;An aspect of these studies that was frequently cited as one of the mostvaluable findings has to do with how satisfied or dissatisfied people arewith the information and data they say they need to perform their jobs orbusiness processes in their respective businesses or enterprises.andP;  An actualstudy determined that one of the greatest benefits from the interview of keyindividuals was their evaluation of the data views they use.andM;These evaluations used both individually and collectively highlighted areaswhere there were opportunities to improve the information needs of thebusiness or enterprise.andP;  Among the powerful features of the ISMOD methodologyand tool is a data satisfaction metric; this feature allows the datarequirements for a business or enterprise to be clearly identified.andP;  Thismetric is described below.andM;The metric.andP;  ISMOD defines a data satisfaction metric as follows: if one hasno criticisms of the information needed to perform a job or a businessprocess, the data satisfaction index is said to be 1.0; if, in contrast, onehas a criticism of the information needed to perform a job or businessprocess, the data satisfaction index is said to be 0.0.andP;  ISMOD generallyallows each customer to tailor the critiques to reflect their ownorganization so that a typical list of possible data critiques might include:andM;Accuracy: Do you have doubts about the accuracy of the data?andM;Completeness: Are all of the data that are needed present?andM;Medium used: Are the data presented in an effective way?andM;Missing data: Are the data missing?andM;Reliability: Do you question the reliability of the data?andM;Timeliness: Do you receive the data late?andM;The total satisfaction index is defined to be the ratio Of INFORMATIONWITHOUT CRITICISMS tO ALL INFORMATION NEEDED.andP;  Thus, if a person or adepartment indicates that they need I 00 items of information to do a job andthey are unhappy with 50 of these items, their satisfaction index is said tobe 0.andP;  50 or 501 1 00.andP;  This index is used in three key ways:andM;1.andP;  To highlight data with the lowest satisfaction indexandM;2.andP;  To highlight processes which have information and data requirements withthe lowest satisfaction indexandM;3.andP;  To highlight organizations having the lowest satisfaction index withregard to their information and data requirementsandM;Data qualifiers.andP;  ISMOD provides another unique perspective that allowsbusinesses or enterprises to classify and view their informationrequirements.andP;  This perspective is the identification of qualifiers, and theytypically include the following kinds of categories:andM;* Essential data-Are these data key to the organization?andM;* Computerization-Are the data currently computerized?andM;* Text-Are the data presented in text form?andM;* Graphics-Are the data presented in graphics format?andM;* Office data -Do the data consist of office data?andM;* Required computerization-Are the data of a type that should becomputerized?andM;* Batching-Are the data batch-oriented?andM;* Real-time access-Do the data require real-time access?andM;These categories may be reviewed individually and viewed with theirindividual satisfaction indices.andP;  This perspective allowed the iBM customersto quickly ascertain those areas that needed assistance in satisfying theirdata requirements.andP;  Comparisons across organizations and across processes arealso provided to further analyze where and what the key areas are in whichdata and information requirements are not being met.andM;Data sharingandM;The significance of data sharing in these studies was related to thedevelopment of integrated solutions.andP;  That is, high-level process andapplication architectures were identified by use of the concept of datasharing.andP;  This action was possible because of the powerful feature of theISMOD tool as described previously.andP;  Another perspective on how the clusterfeature works is:andM;* Identify and store in the ISMOD computer model information about businessprocesses, such as which business processes create which data views and whichbusiness processes use which data views.andM;* Run ISMOD reports and matrixes to ascertain the degree of data sharingamong different business processes.andP;  How many data views do individualbusiness processes use that are created by business processes other thanthemselves?andM;* Regroup business processes using ISMOD tOOl SUPport to obtain optimalclusters of business processes focusing on minimization of data sharingacross business processes.andM;As stated, the major way in which data sharing was utilized in most of thestudies cited in this paper was in identifying tactical or major applicationclusters.andP;  That is, the criterion for establishing application clusters ofbusiness processes was that the respective business processes had thegreatest degree of interaction with each other relative to using data viewscreated by other business processes in the same cluster, versus using dataviews created by business processes in other clusters.andM;Data views were shared between clusters but not to the same degree as sharingbetween business processes in the same cluster.andP;  The degree of data sharingwas identified with an analytic approach incorporated in ISMOD.andM;Data sharing, as defined by ISMOD, is meant to be the use of data or a dataview by one business process of data or a data view that was created byanother business process.andP;  Furthermore, ISMOD defines a metric that describesthe degree of data sharing used by one or more business processes.andP;  Thisdefinition is:andM;Assume a business process, say A, uses 100 elements of data or 100 data viewsto accomplish its functions.andP;  Furthermore, assume that business process Aitself creates 50 elements of data or data views that it needs to accomplishits functions.andP;  Then, ISMOD defines the degree of data sharing or isolationof A to be 0.50, or 50 percent.andP;  That is, A itself creates 50 percent of theinformation it needs to accomplish its functions.andP;  It gets the other 50percent of the information it needs from other business processes.andP;  So it canbe said that it shares data with other business processes for 50 percent ofits information requirements.andM;Data sharing across processes or functions is represented by the dataelements or data views created by one process and used by another process.andM;A metric for measuring data sharing.andP;  ISMOD defines a metric to measure thedegree of data sharing and to identify clusters as follows:andM;Assume business process A uses 100 data views to accomplish its functions andit supplies 40 of the data views itself Then its isolation ratio is definedto be 40/ 1 00 or 0.40.andM;Assume business process B uses 100 data views to accomplish its functions andit supplies 60 of the data views itself.andP;  Then its isolation ratio is definedto be 60/100 or 0.60.andM;The average isolation ratio (IM) between two business processes, say A and B,is defined to be the arithmetic average of the individual isolation ratios.andM;For example, 0.40 for A and 0.60 for B so thatandM;IM = 0.40 + 0.60 = 1.00 divided by 2 = 0.50andM;The extended isolation ratio (IE) between two business processes, say A andB, is defined to be the isolation ratio calculated, assuming the twoprocesses (in this case A and B), were grouped together and formed oneprocess.andP;  In this example we will assume that there is data sharing betweenbusiness processes A and B to the extent that B gets 20 of the 100 data viewsit needs from A, but A gets none of the 100 data views it needs from B. (SeeFigure 6.) Then the extended isolation ratio between business processes A andB is defined to be:andM;IE = (40 + 60 + 20)/(100 + 100)andM;= 120/200 = 0.60andM;The delta isolation ratio (DI) between two business processes is defined tobe the difference between the average and the extended isolation ratios forthe two processes as follows:andM;DI = (IE - IM) = 0.60 - 0.50 = 0.10andM;The significance of these ratios relates to how one can identify where thegreatest degree of data sharing takes place between business processes orclusters of business processes.andP;  ISMOD Calculates all of the above ratios forevery combination of business processes in its model and allows one to lookfor those that share the most data.andP;  The DI is the key to this perspectivefor it indicates where the biggest increase in data sharing will occur acrossall of the processes with which an individual process may interact.andP;  That is,the bigger the DI, the greater the degree of data sharing.andP;  This perspectiveis elaborated in the next section.andM;Data sharing between two processes is depicted in Figure 6.andM;Example of a data sharing matrix.andP;  Figure 7 represents a data sharing orisolation ratio matrix produced by ISMOD for an actual customer study.andP;  Itsdirect use to develop a process architecture can be seen in Figure 8.andP;  Theinterpretation of this matrix follows.andM;The rows and columns represent business processes; in fact, they are the thevery same business processes mapped against each other.andP;  The two-digitnumbers from 11 to 29 refer to unique business clusters of businessprocesses, such as trading, positions, futures, contracts, and log or plan.andO;These processes can be interpreted differently depending on whether they areviewed from the row or column perspective.andP;  The row perspective is that of a&quot;using&quot; business process.andP;  That is, one looks across a particular row todetermine how many data elements or data views a particular process is usingand is receiving from a particular business process, as viewed downward froma particular column.andP;  The interpretation of the business processes listed onthe column headings is that of creating business processes.andP;  These processescreate the data elements or data views used by the processes listed in therows.andM;The entries in individual cells of the matrix show: number of data usages byusing process from creating process (ABC); the average data sharing orisolation ratio of the using and creating processes at that cell (IM); thedata sharing or isolation ratio of the using and creating processes if theywere included in the same cluster (IE); and the improvement in data sharingor isolation ratio if the using and creating processes were indeed groupedtogether in the same cluster (DI).andM;At the intersection of row 11 with column 14 the respective values are: ABC =181, IM = 0.414, IE = 0.479, and DI = 0.065.andP;  The meanings of these numbersare: process 11 has 181 usages of data or data views that are created byprocess 14; the average data sharing or isolation ratio of processes I 1 and14 is 0.414; the data sharing or isolation ratio, if processes 11 and 14 weregrouped into the same cluster would be 0.479; and the increase in datasharing or isolation ratio for processes 11 and 14, if they indeed were putin the same cluster, would be 0.065.andM;Example of process architectureandM;Figure 8 is actually taken from an IBM-Supported business/enterprise modelingstudy.andP;  It depicts the subsystems suggested by the clustering or processarchitecture facilities OFISMOD.andP;  Each of the rectangles in the figurerepresents a cluster of business processes that were identified as candidatesfor the same cluster using the data sharing analysis Of ISMOD.andP;  Therefore,they can also be viewed as applications.andP;  The size of the rectangles isproportionate to the number of data usages identified in thebusiness/enterprise modeling study.andP;  The size of the connectors is alsoproportionate to the number of data elements or data views being sharedacross clusters or applications.andP;  Each rectangle is subdivided into threesections: the leftmost section represents the data elements or data viewscreated by that cluster or application and shared by another cluster; themiddle section represents the data elements or data views created by thatcluster or application and used by itself-, and the right most sectionrepresents the data elements or data views used by that cluster orapplication and obtained from a different cluster or application.andP;  The sizeof the sections within the rectangles is also proportionate to the number ofdata views being created and used.andM;Tools usedandM;ISMOD is a tool used to support a top-down information requirements study ofa business or enterprise.andP;  It has been used in more than 450 studies of IBMcustomers worldwide and incorporates key quantitative analyses of theinformation requirements and flow throughout a company.andP;  In addition, itprovides a simulation capability to determine the effect of implementing anew computer-based application.andM;The dimensions of the business model include data and information, datacriticism, data flow identification, data flow metrics, data qualifiers,event trigger, location, organization, and processes.andP;  Relationships areidentified and maintained in the model among all of the above dimensions.andM;DevelopMate is a tool used to develop a business/enterprise model withdimensions that include business processes, business data, events, physicallocations, and performing organizations.andP;  It incorporates an import functionthat will load from ISMOD business/enterprise modeling information.andM;The Logical Design Process (LDP) is a methodology with associated toolsupport that allows one to analyze an existing information management system(IMS) or related application and determine its propensity for distributeddata processing.andP;  That is, one could define the business processes,databases, and physical locations and then take actual real-life data fromIMS log tapes and build a business model showing processes, data and dataflows, and locations where the processes were performed.andP;  This informationcomes from an existing centralized set of IMS applications.andP;  Simulationscould then be performed to determine the feasibility of distributing or offloading the data to distributed processors so as to be in physical proximityto the performers of the business processes.andP;  This tool was used for a numberof customers from the banking, manufacturing, and transportation industries.andM;Concluding remarksandM;There was added value for every iBM CUstomer cited here that utilized theapproach of business/enterprise modeling as described in this paper.andP;  Onecustomer, the oil company, indicated that there was no way in which theycould have undertaken a worldwide requirements study of their corporationwithout the assistance of a tool such as ISMOD and that the study was one ofthe most important they had ever undertaken.andP;  Another, a power company,stated that the use of this approach to develop their strategic requirementsfor computer support allowed them significant cost savings in terms ofshortening the study duration and avoiding the use of costly outsideconsultants.andM;A summary of the benefits of the value of business/enterprise modeling citedin this paper would include both quantitative and qualitative perspectives asfollows:andM;Qualitative-A greater degree of precision and enlarged scope is provided fromthe use of a rigorous methodology and tool support to analyze the businessinformation needs of an enterprise.andP;  In addition, opportunities to improvebusiness processes are identified, and an integrated systems architecture isproduced.andM;Quantitative-There are actual dollar savings associated with the approachescited in this paper relating to cost avoidance of consultant services, lesstime devoted to these studies, and savings in time required for applicationand database design.andM;AcknowledgmentsandM;There are a number of individuals currently or previously employed by IBMthat this author acknowledges as being the pioneers or pathfinders forbusiness/enterprise modeling.andP;
