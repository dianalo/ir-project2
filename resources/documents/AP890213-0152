Manley, prime minister from 1972-80, took the oath of office inan hour-long ceremony before about 3,500 guests on the lawn ofKing's House, official residence of the British governor-general,Sir Florizel Glasspole.   Diplomats and other guests sat before the platform under abrilliant sun on the eastern side of the rambling, colonial-stylemansion.   Glasspole, as representative of Queen Elizabeth II, administeredthe oath with the same Bible used by the Caribbean nation's firstpremier, Sir Alexander Bustamante, in 1962, the year Jamaica gainedindependence from Britain.   Jamaica belongs to the Commonweath, the global association offormer British coloniies and territories, and Manley sworeallegiance to the queen ``and her heirs and successors.''   Manley won a five-year term in a landslide victory last Thursdayover conservative Prime Minister Edward Seaga, who held the officefor eight years and was one of the United States' closest allies inthe region.   Manley and Seaga attended a special ecumenical ``service ofnational peace and unity'' Sunday to set a conciliatory tone at theoutset of the new government. Violence during the three-weekcampaign left 13 people dead.   Manley, who has said he wants to visit Washington as soon aspossible, told the gathering he would seek good relations withJamaica's traditional allies.   ``We are already well-advanced in the establishment of ourrelations with the new administration which guides the affairs ofour most powerful neighbor, the United States of America,'' he saidto applause.   ``She's our biggest trading partner, our largest source oftourists, with the greatest potential for foreign investment.''   He singled out U.S. Ambassador Michael Sotirhos in the audience,saying he wanted to pay tribute to him ``for his even-handednessbefore the election and for his immensely energetic assistance onceit became clear that the people of Jamaica had made their choice.''   On domestic matters, Manley repeated his pledge to work withSeaga in clamping down on illegal guns and drugs and in fosteringunity among political factions.   He warned ``there may be economic trouble on our horizon'' as aresult of the costly election campaign and the aftereffects ofHurricane Gilbert, which hit the island on Sept. 12, killing 45people and causing $1 billion damage.   The Electoral Office had no breakdown of the popular vote, butManley's People's National Party was declared the winner Thursdaynight with 57 percent of the unofficial tally to 43 percent forSeaga's Jamaica Labor Party.   Complete but unofficial results gave Manley's party 47 seats inParliament to 13 for Seaga's party.   Manley and Seaga attended a special ecumenical service Sunday toset a conciliatory tone. Violence during the three-week campaignleft 13 people dead.   In contrast to the policies of his previous government, whichappropriated private farms and hotels, Manley says he wants to giveprivate enterprise a free hand in boosting production and has``abandoned all thoughts of nationalization.''   In the 1970s, Manley sought close ties with Cuba's Fidel Castroand spoke out against alleged CIA plots and capitalism, alienatingthe United States and foreign investors and plunging Jamaica intoeconomic chaos.   Manley has said he would restore relations with Cuba but wouldalso restrict Cuban influence in Jamaica to avoid antagonizing theUnited States.   Manley has said he would honor Jamaica's $3.8 billion foreigndebt, but is seeking a new approach to reducing the burden ofinterest payments on developing countries.   Although Manley's term is five years, he can call the nextelection earlier. Seaga, 58, becomes leader of the officialparliamentary opposition.</TEXT></DOC>
