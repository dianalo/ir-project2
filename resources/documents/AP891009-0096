STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A rundown Lutheran Church in a shabby section ofEast Berlin has become the rallying point for once-disparateopposition groups aiming for historic reforms in their communisthomeland.   Outside Gethsemane Church, there were violent clashes in recentdays as police moved in to crush peaceful protests for democraticreform. Public support for change has swelled in the city and otherparts of East Germany in recent weeks.   Nationwide protests the past three days have been the largestsince 1953, when Soviet tanks helped put down a popular uprising.   The wave of unrest came as the communist government heldelaborately choreographed state ceremonies marking the nation's40th anniversary.   Like St. Brygida's Church in Gdansk, which became the focalpoint of Solidarity activities in Poland, the weathered 19thcentury Gethsemane Church is a magnet for activists to discussstrategy and political platforms.   ``We come here because we want peaceful change and because thereis nowhere else where we can find sanctuary,'' said an East Berlinhuman rights activist in her 20s.   The church became the center for dissidents after protestersbegan a vigil and fast last week for imprisoned activists.   When police charge protesters to disperse them, hundreds flee tothe legal sanctuary of the fenced-in church grounds.   Scores of others often spend the night inside, fearing they willbe arrested if they attempt to leave.   Although the Lutheran Church in East Germany has long pursued anuneasy policy of coexistence with the state, it has also provided ahaven for independent human rights and ecology groups.   Its leadership has urged the government to enter into a dialoguewith dissident groups, and many pastors have become increasingvocal in their criticism of the hardline leadership's rejection ofreforms.   Thousands of supporters stream to the red-brick GethsemaneChurch each day to hold rallies and to learn of the latestdevelopments from the growing opposition network around the country.   Hundreds of candles glitter at the entrance to show solidaritywith those arrested and imprisoned in demonstrations across thecountry.   Banners calling for peace and freedom flap from the church'sscaffolded steeple. Pastors scurry about, helping with logisticsand urging those assembled to avoid violence.   Activists standing on the chipped concrete steps pass plasticbuckets around to collect donations for opposition causes.   Hardline communist authorities have deployed hundreds ofsecurity officials surrounding the church to prevent groups fromheading to main thoroughfares. They fear the daily rallies willsnowball into mass demonstrations like those that erupted over lastweekend.   Uniformed police officers check the identity papers of thoseattempting to reach the church.   The area has been declared off-limits to Western televisioncrews and news photographers since Sunday. Western reporters wererefused access again Monday.   East Germany's opposition movement has long been plagued byintense government suppression. Security officials routinelyharrass its members, and emerging leaders have been frequentlyexpelled to West Germany.   The groups have been fractious and small and, until recently,were only able to achieve a loose countrywide network. Many beganas ecological and peace discussion groups.   But the groups have become increasing bolder, buoyed by reformsin the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary.   Growing frustration over the government's intransigence tochange and the recent exodus of tens of thousands of East Germansto West Germany has also spurred many pro-democracy supporters tobroader public activism.   Last week, seven pro-democracy and rights groups signed a jointdeclaration saying they would work together so that ``all EastGermans have the right to exercise their political rights.''   ``We have a duty to demand from the state and party leadershipthat they restore the people's confidence in the government,'' saidWerner Fischer, a founder of one of East Germany's oldest humanrights groups.</TEXT></DOC>
