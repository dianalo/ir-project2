But the major assault by U.S.-backed rebels against the cityappears to have stalled, they said.   Also Sunday, the Afghan Foreign Ministry issued a statementcriticizing the United States for continuing to arm thePakistani-based rebels, saying it underscored an American desire forwar in Afghanistan.   Government sources and diplomats said the assault on Khost, whichbegan 10 days ago, was aimed at gaining recognition from thenon-aligned summit that begins in Belgrade, Yugoslavia on Monday.President Najib said in a statement released Sunday that he wouldseek special backing for his peace proposals at the conference.   In the Khost fighting, government sources said the Afghan troopshad recaptured three posts but still were trying to take four morefortified positions lost in earlier fighting.   The most strategic of those was at Daragai, 10 miles south of thecity, because it controls the main supply routes between Pakistanand the capital.   The provincial capital, just 18 miles from the Pakistani border,is considered the most vulnerable to rebel assault because supplylines are so short.   ``We have felt a lot of pressure in the last week,'' said onegovernment official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Thethreat has diminished, but their effort has not collapsed.''   The guerrillas issued a statement Saturday in Pakistan saying theAfghan army had failed to take the position at Daragai.   The official described the fighting around the city as``serious.''   He said Khost remained secure because the strategic routes intothe city were heavily mined. The government supplies its troops byair because the road to the capital has long been controlled by therebels.   Government troops also have been fighting rebel assaults aroundthe city of Jalalabad, 120 miles east of the capital, and in thesoutheastern province of Kandahar, the officials said.   Kabul was quiet a day after rocket attacks killed 16 and injured52.   The Afghan Foreign Ministry issued its criticism of the UnitedStates in response to remarks made Thursday in Pakistan by PeterTomsen, special U.S. envoy to the guerrillas.   Tomsen said the United States would continue to arm theguerrillas in their effort to topple the Soviet-backed government inKabul. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia also support the rebels.   Tomsen's statements ``indicate the war-mongering policy of theUnited States,'' the statement said.   The Soviet Union withdrew its 115,000 troops in Afghanistan inFebruary under a U.N.-sponsored agreement to end the fighting thatstarted in 1979.   The rebels formed an interim government but have failed inrepeated efforts to capture a provincial capital to use as its seat.   The president, speaking to the official agency Bakhtar before hisdeparture late Saturday, said he would propose that the non-alignedmovement set up a committee to pursue his peace proposals.   Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are expected to lead the fight againstthe committee.   Najib has proposed negotiating with the rebels in conjunctionwith a six month cease-fire to be followed by nationwide elections.</TEXT></DOC>
