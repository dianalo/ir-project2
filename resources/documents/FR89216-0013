L. 100-690 (enactedNovember 18, 1988), amended the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAAAct) of August 29, 1935 (27 U.S.C. andSection; 201 et seq.) by designatingthe existing sections of the FAA Act as ``Title I,'' and by adding at theend a new title, ``Title II_Alcoholic Beverage Labeling.'' This title,cited as the ``Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act of 1988'' (hereinafter,``Title II'' or ``the Act''), requires that a specific health warning statementappear on the labels of all containers of alcoholic beverages for saleor distribution in the United States. This requirement applies both tointerstate and intrastate sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages.In addition, the health warning statement must appear on containers ofalcoholic beverages that are sold, distributed, or shipped to members orunits of the U.S. Armed Forces, including those located outside the UnitedStates.The health warning statement required by Title II advises of the risksof birth defects in pregnant women, impairment of the ability to operatea car or other machinery, and other potential health problems resultingfrom the consumption of alcoholic beverages. As stated in section 202 ofthe Act:<ITAG tagnum="21"> The Congress finds that the American public should be informed aboutthe health hazards that may result from the consumption or abuse of alcoholicbeverages, and has determined that it would be beneficial to provide aclear, nonconfusing reminder of such hazards, and that there is a needfor national uniformity in such reminders in order to avoid the promulgationof incorrect or misleading information * * *.</ITAG>Thus, for the reasons noted above, the law provides that no State may requireany statement concerning alcoholic beverages and health, other than therequired health warning statement, on any alcoholic beverage container,or box, carton, or other package that contains such a container.For purposes of Title II, the term ``alcoholic beverage'' includes anybeverage in liquid form which contains not less than one-half of one percent(.5%) of alcohol by volume and is intended for human consumption. Thus,the term includes distilled spirits products, malt beverages, wines andwine coolers. The term ``container'' is defined as the innermost sealedcontainer, irrespective of the material from which made, in which an alcoholicbeverage is placed by the bottler and in which such beverage is offeredfor sale to members of the general public.Section 204 of the Act provides that compliance with the health warninglabeling requirement becomes effective one year after the date of enactmentof Title II (November 18, 1989). This section also requires the Secretaryof the Treasury to prescribe regulations regarding the placement, typesize, etc. of the health warning statement.Temporary Rule_Health Warning StatementIn accordance with the provisions of section 204(a) of the Act, the followinghealth warning statement shall appear on the labels of all imported ordomestic alcoholic beverages bottled on and after November 18, 1989, forsale or distribution in the United States:<ITAG tagnum="21">Government warning: (1) According to the Surgeon General, women shouldnot drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birthdefects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability todrive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems.</ITAG>The legislative history of the Act clearly shows that Congress intendedthat the health warning statement be placed on the labels of alcoholicbeverage containers at the time of bottling. In that regard, the reportof the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on theAlcoholic Beverage Labeling bill (S. 2047) stated: ``The bill, as reported,requires that bottlers affix a warning label to all alcoholic beveragecontainers bottled 12 months or more after the date of enactment.'' S.Rep. No. 596, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1988). The report goes on to notethat ``[t]he Committee does not intend that the labeling requirement ** * require the labeling or relabeling of alcoholic beverages that werebottled prior to the expiration of the 12-month period specified * * *.''S. Rep. No. 596 at 6-7. Thus, alcoholic beverages bottled prior to November18, 1989, whether labeled or not, need not include the health warning statementon the container. If requested, U.S. importers and bottlers shall providedocumentation verifying that such products were bottled prior to November18, 1989. In addition, section 204(b) of the Act specifies that the health warningstatement ``shall be located in a conspicuous and prominent place on thecontainer * * * as determined by the Secretary, shall be in type of a sizedetermined by the Secretary, and shall appear on a contrasting background.''Congress anticipated that the Secretary of the Treasury, when making thedeterminations noted above, ``may consider current (alcoholic beveragelabeling) regulations and will need to take into account variations inthe size and shape of individual containers * * *.'' S. Rep. No. 596 at7. Placement/Legibility In determining the requirements for disclosure of the health warning statementthe Bureau has relied upon the current regulations as set forth in Title27, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 4, 5, and 7 relating to thelabeling and advertising of wine, distilled spirits, and malt beverages,respectively. In particular, the Bureau believes that consideration ofthe existing labeling requirements for the mandatory disclosure of theartificial sweetener saccharin is appropriate, since these requirementswere implemented by the Bureau in recognition of the health warning statementset forth in the Saccharin Study and Labeling Act (21 U.S.C. 343). As specified in existing regulations, 27 CFR 4.32(d), 5.32(b)(6), and 7.22(b)(5),any alcohol beverage product which contains saccharin must bear on itslabel a health warning statement disclosing the presence of that ingredient.The warning statement may appear on a front (i.e., brand label or separatefront label) or back label, and shall be separate and apart from all otherinformation. In giving effect to this requirement, the Bureau has authorizeddisclosure on a side label. Furthermore, as prescribed in 27 CFR 4.38,5.33, and 7.28, all mandatory labeling information, including the saccharinwarning, must be readily legible and on a contrasting background. Similarly, with this temporary rule, the Bureau is adopting regulationswhich will require the health warning statement prescribed in Title IIto appear on the brand label or separate front label, or on a back or sidelabel, separate and apart from all other information, readily legible andon a contrasting background. Furthermore, the label upon which the healthwarning statement appears must be firmly affixed to the container. TheBureau believes that these regulations provide flexibility to producersof alcoholic beverages with respect to the placement of the warning statementand also comply with the requirement that the warning statement be ``conspicuousand prominent.'' Type Size Minimum type size requirements for mandatory label information for wine,distilled spirits, and malt beverages are prescribed in 27 CFR 4.38(b),5.33(b), and 7.28(b), respectively. For containers of wine bottled in anauthorized metric standard of fill of more than 187 milliliters (6.3 fl.oz.) i.e., 375 milliliters, 750 milliliters, 1 liter, 1.5 liters, 3 liters,etc., the minimum type size for mandatory information (excluding alcoholiccontent) is two millimeters. For containers of wine bottled in an authorizedmetric standard of fill of 187 milliliters or less (i.e., 100 millilitersor 50 milliliters), the minimum type size for mandatory information isone millimeter. For containers of distilled spirits bottled in an authorized metric standardof fill of more than 200 milliliters (6.8 fl. oz.) i.e., 375 milliliters,500 milliliters, 750 milliliters, 1 liter, or 1.75 liters, the minimumtype size for mandatory information is two millimeters. For containersof distilled spirits bottled in an authorized metric standard of fill of200 milliliters or less i.e., 100 milliliters or 50 milliliters, the minimumtype size for mandatory information is one millimeter. For malt beverages in containers having a capacity of more than one-halfpint (8 fl. oz.), approximately 237 milliliters, the minimum type sizefor mandatory information is two millimeters. For containers of one-halfpint or less, the minimum type size for mandatory information is one millimeter.As indicated above, Congress intended that the type sizes currently requiredfor mandatory label information, noted above, be considered for the healthwarning statement and that variations in size and shape of container betaken into account. Thus, for alcoholic beverages in large containers,the health warning statement shall appear in a type size not smaller thantwo millimeters. For small containers, the health warning statement shallnot be smaller than one millimeter. Specifically, this temporary rule prescribes regulations which requirethat, for alcoholic beverages in containers having a capacity of more than237 milliliters (8 fl. oz.), the minimum type size for the health warningstatement is two millimeters. For containers of alcoholic beverages havinga capacity of 237 milliliters or less, the minimum type size for the healthwarning statement is one millimeter. Exports Section 204(c) of Title II provides that the health warning labeling requirementdoes not apply to alcoholic beverages produced, imported, bottled, or labeledfor export from the United States, or for delivery to an aircraft or vesselas supplies for consumption beyond the jurisdiction of the internal revenuelaws of the United States. As previously noted, this exemption does notapply to alcoholic beverages for sale, distribution, or shipment to theU.S. Armed Forces. <ITAG tagnum="81">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>In compliance with Executive Order 12291, ATF has determined that thisdocument is not a major rule, because the economic effects flow directlyfrom the underlying statute and not from this temporary rule. Therefore,it is found that this temporary rule will not result in: (a) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (b) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(c) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="81">Administrative Procedure Act </ITAG>Because this document merely implements a law which requires that a healthwarning statement appear on the labels of all alcoholic beverages, andbecause immediate guidance is necessary to implement the provisions ofthat law, it is found to be impracticable to issue this Treasury decisionwith notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b), or subject to theeffective date limitation in section 553(d). <ITAG tagnum="81">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to a final regulatoryflexibility analysis (5 U.S.C. 604) are not applicable to this temporaryrule because the agency was not required to publish a general notice ofproposed rulemaking under 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other law. <ITAG tagnum="81">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511,44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR Part 1320,do not apply to this temporary rule because no requirement to collect informationis imposed. <ITAG tagnum="81">Drafting Information </ITAG>The author of this document is James P.
