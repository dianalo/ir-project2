Bishop (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> IFF </CO><TEXT>   Scientists have taken a key step forward in their understanding of how the nose knows.    Researchers at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions reported Friday in Science magazine that they found a protein that performs the first step in the nose's detection of odors.    The protein, which the nose sprays into inhaled air, latches onto odorant molecules. The protein then links the molecules to nerve cell receptors in the nose, activating the sense of smell, the researchers hypothesized.    Discovery of the odorant-binding protein helps explain a major mystery about the acute sensitivity of the human sense of smell, said Solomon Snyder, the scientist who headed the Johns Hopkins team.    Dr. Snyder said researchers have long been baffled by the fact that the human nose can detect odors as diluted as one odorant molecule per trillion molecules of air, because tests on the olfactory nerves show that the nerves are activated by concentrations 1,000 times greater. &quot;Our ability to smell things seemed to kind of violate the laws of nature,&quot; Dr. Snyder said.    The odorant-binding protein appears to be the way in which the nose gathers odorant molecules into large enough concentrations to be detected by the nerves. &quot;It is kind of an amplifying device,&quot; Dr. Snyder explained.    The protein, the researchers found, is produced by a single gland in the nose and conveyed to the tip of the nose through a tiny duct. From there, the protein is sprayed into the incoming air to latch onto any odorant molecules.    The protein was isolated by finding and cloning the gene that serves as the blueprint for it. Once the gene was in hand, the researchers were able to deduce the chemistry of the protein.    The research was funded by International Flavors andamp; Fragrances Inc., New York, the world's largest supplier of fragrances for perfumes, cosmetics, and household chemicals and of flavors for processed foods.    International Flavors has first rights to license any commercial applications of the research, though it wasn't clear what they would be. Dr. Snyder noted that taste was highly dependent on the sense of smell. Appetites of the elderly, cancer patients and other ill persons who tend not to eat might be revived by spraying the odorant-binding protein into the air or into the nose when meals are served, he speculated.    Dr. Snyder said the researchers also made what may be a more far-reaching discovery. A computer search found that the odorant-binding protein has a structure similar to a protein known to bind vitamin A. This protein is what allows vitamin A, or retinol, to be carried by the bloodstream to the eye, where it is used to make a pigment vital to vision, another of the five senses. Thus, the discovery might open an entirely new field of research on the role of binding proteins in bodily functions. </TEXT></DOC>
