The 24-year-old junior analyst in the mergers and acquisitionsdepartment was named in a Securities and Exchange Commissioncomplaint Monday alleging he conspired with a Hong Kong businessmanto profit illegally from takeover stocks using inside information.   Morgan Stanley said it suspended Wang last Friday when SECinvestigators subpoenaed him following a discreet investigationthat lasted two months. Wang's whereabouts weren't known Monday andhis attorney, former SEC regional commissioner Ira L. Sorkin,declined to comment on any aspect of the case.   The complaint asked the federal court in New York to order thereturn of $19 million in alleged trading profits plus triple thatamount in damages, for a total of $76 million.   Wang, who was said to make about $35,000 annually in salary andbonus, was scheduled to complete his training program this Friday.   Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement chief, said the case is thesecond biggest insider trading case ever handled by the SEC,dwarfed only by the case brought against Ivan Boesky, the formerspeculator who paid the enforcement agency a record $100 million indisgorged profits and penalties in November 1986.   Wang attended the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana forfour years, beginning in the fall of 1982, first studying politicalscience, then switching to finance and accounting, officials at theschool said.   But administrators at the university's main record office and atthe College of Commerce said Wang did not finish his course work.   Larry Friedman, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, said the investmenthouse was aware Wang was ``about two credits shy of his degree''when he entered the training program in the summer of 1986.   Asked whether Wang had access to particularly sensitive materialwhile working at Morgan, Friedman said: ``It sure looks that way.''   The investment house considers the analysts ``full employees _they sit in on meetings, they're put to work, but they should notbreak the rules,'' the spokesman said.   Like all Morgan employees, Wang and his peers were given writtenguidelines that address how to deal with sensitive information,client confidentiality as well as insider information. The Morganspokesman said the detailed guidelines ``go beyond a code ofethics.''</TEXT></DOC>
