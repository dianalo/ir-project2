Corn crops at two sites in Maryland are to be treated with the company's insecticide and monitored throughout the summer. Crop Genetics said that its insecticide is the result of a $9 million development effort, and that if the field tests are successful, the company expects to invest an additional $11 million in an effort to bring the product to market by 1990.    Crop Genetics estimated that the market for such an insecticide could be about $100 million a year, and it said that U.S. farmers currently spend about $50 million annually on chemical insecticides to control the pest. According to the company, the pest infests most of the 67 million acres of U.S. farm land annually devoted to corn production.    The EPA said the insecticide, which combines two microorganisms, is &quot;not likely to be harmful&quot; to humans, animals, fish or insects other than the corn borer.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Crop Genetics shares rose 62.5 cents, to close at $9. </TEXT></DOC>
