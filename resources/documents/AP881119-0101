Khomeini rejected the offer, Tehran Radio said.   Carter issued a statement in Atlanta confirming he wrote a letterto Khomeini but saying it was in response to an initiative from Iran.   According to the radio report, monitored in Nicosia, Khomeiniissued a statement denying any connection between Iran and thehostages in Lebanon. ``Just as I have said before, the relationshipof Iran and the United States is like the relationship of the wolfand the lamb, and between these two there can never bereconciliation,'' the statement said.   The radio quoted Carter's letter as saying, ``I hope that theAmerican hostages in Lebanon can be released as soon as possible;this act would remove one of the main hurdles in there-establishment of friendly relations between Iran and the U.S.''   Carter's statement, read to The Associated Press by spokeswomanCarrie Harmon, said: ``In my note, I was responding to an initiativefrom Iran. My purpose was to obtain the release of David Rabhan, afriend of mine who has been imprisoned in Iran for almost nine years.   ``My hope is that in the name of justice and humanity, Iran willuse its influence to encourage the release of all American hostagesby working through normal channels.''   Ms. Harmon did not identify Rabhan further or say why he wasimprisoned. She also said the full text of the letter would not bereleased.   Fourteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are held byLebanese Shiite groups believed loyal to Iran. The hostage heldlongest is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondentfor The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   The radio said the letter, dated Oct. 30, was received byKhomeini's office and that Iranian experts confirmed it was Carter'shandwriting.   ``To stop this effort from becoming politicized in our country,and delaying the release of the hostages, a neutral American channelmust be used, and we at the Carter Center are prepared to help inevery appropriate manner,'' the radio quoted the letter as saying.   The Carter Center, opened in Atlanta in 1986, houses Carter'spresidential library as well as his office and is dedicated toresearch and discussion of public policy.   The radio quoted Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani assaying he also received a letter from Carter about the hostages.   ``I myself received such a letter from Carter alluding to thesinister politics of ties with Iran and hostage-taking in Lebanon,''the radio quoted Rafsanjani as saying.   Ties between the United States and Iran were broken in 1979 whenIranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and helddiplomats hostage for 444 days. Carter has said the crisis, whichtook place during his term as president, led to his defeat by RonaldReagan in the 1980 presidential elections.   The radio said Khomeini ordered his letter made public in orderto ``prevent any kind of exploitation.'' It did not elaborate.</TEXT></DOC>
