Schulman, former president of Bevill, Bresler andamp; Schulman Inc., was convicted of three tax-related felonies in the first criminal trial arising from the firm's 1985 collapse. The jury was deadlocked on 21 other counts.    After 3 1/2 days of deliberation, a federal jury in Newark, N.J., found Mr. Schulman guilty on the three tax counts on which he was indicted last October -- conspiracy to file false tax returns and two counts of filing false returns.    The jury didn't return a verdict on the 21 other counts, including alleged securities fraud and related charges.    Prosecutors are expected to seek to retry Mr. Schulman on the 21 other counts. &quot;We are taking a day or two to assess our position and make a decision at that time,&quot; Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul A. Weissman said.    Mr. Schulman, 39 years old, is the only former Bevill Bresler executive to plead innocent in the government-securities firm's April 1985 collapse, which the government says defrauded banks, thrifts and municipalities of $144 million.    Livingston, N.J.-based Bevill and an affiliate, Bevill, Bresler andamp; Schulman Asset Management Corp., are being liquidated.    Barry H. Evenchick, Mr. Schulman's attorney, said yesterday that he was &quot;gratified the jury didn't find my client guilty (of the securities-fraud counts). To me, that's a victory.&quot;    Federal Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise set sentencing for June 29, the same sentencing date as four other former Bevill executives who pleaded guilty in the case. Mr. Schulman faces a maximum 11 years in prison on the tax counts, in addition to fines.    Testimony in the monthlong trial yielded one major surprise. As previously reported, other Bevill executives -- though not Mr. Schulman -- alleged that Robert A. Rough, a former director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1982 to 1984, leaked closely guarded information on the Fed's discount rate to Bevill Bresler and that he received a $42,000 loan from Mr. Schulman in exchange.    Mr. Schulman testified that he lent the money in his capacity as Mr. Rough's friend and didn't receive Fed information.    Mr. Weissman, the prosecutor, said that charges might be brought against Mr. Rough, who until recently was chairman of the New Jersey Bankers Association, if the U.S. attorney's office &quot;finds evidence of prosecutable&quot; activity.    Court papers in Manhattan disclose that Mr. Rough, who has denied any wrongdoing, was recently subpoenaed to testify before the Securities and Exchange Commission in the SEC's continuing civil probe of the Bevill Bresler collapse. Mr. Schulman is understood to have appeared last Thursday before the SEC and invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.    Mr. Rough's Woodbridge, N.J., attorney, Michael Himmel, declined to comment on whether Mr. Rough appeared before the SEC or testified. He reaffirmed that Mr. Rough denies any misuse of Fed information. </TEXT></DOC>
