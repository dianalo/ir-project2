The agency's annual report, which is always issued a year late, said the kingdom, the world's largest oil exporter, incurred a $13.4 billion deficit in the year as overall revenue fell sharply.    Revenue from non-oil sources dropped about 13%, the report said. The Saudi Press Agency, which published the report, didn't disclose the amount of this revenue or the total of the nation's reserves, officially pegged in early 1985 at more than $100 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
