The accident happened as the supervisors were taking samplesfrom concrete silos holding radioactive waste at the plant, 18miles northwest of Cincinnati. The U.S. Department of Energy, whichowns the plant, said Thursday the supervisors were exposed toradioactive radon gas.   Some officials said the plant's operators should have left suchwork to employees trained to handle the materials. One hundredtrained workers were laid off at the plant Friday.   ``We don't want to interfere in the labor agreements between thecompany and the union, but we need the information (on thecontamination), and we're concerned that the layoffs are affectingthe speed at which we can do our work,'' said Graham Mitchell,Fernald team leader for the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.   The contamination occurred during the latest unsuccessfulattempt to sample the contents of the silos. The silos emit radonand are suspected of leaking waste into groundwater. Mitchell saidcleanup plans are impossible until contents of the silos areanalyzed.   Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, the contractor operating theplant, suspended production this summer to concentrate on cleaningup radioactive pollution.   Ten union workers who had trained extensively for the samplingtask were among those laid off, said Mel Karnes, an official ofAtomic Trades andamp; Labor Council, an umbrella group for the 14 unionsat Fernald.   ``So we've got three salaried individuals out there at 6 p.m. inthe dark and cold, trying to do it when they've had no hands-ontraining,'' Karnes said.   The Fernald plant had processed uranium since 1952 for use innuclear reactors and weapons. Some of the wastes at the plant datefrom the Manhattan Project, which produced the first atomic bombduring World War II.   ``We're very concerned that the trained cleanup people were laidoff. We think it's inappropriate,'' said Catherine McCord, aFernald expert with the EPA in Chicago.   Department of Energy teams from Fernald and one from thedepartment's Oak Ridge, Tenn., laboratories on Friday beganinvestigating Westinghouse's 18-hour delay in reporting thecontamination incident.   ``They're supposed to notify the emergency operations center ineight hours, but in reality they should get to us sooner,'' DOEspokesman Steve Wyatt said. ``It just didn't make very good sense.''</TEXT></DOC>
