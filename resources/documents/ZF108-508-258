Department of DefenseBudgetingMISPolicyInformation Resources ManagementReductionCentralization.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Political Shifts, CIM Flatten DOD IRMandM;Two forces have converged and flattened the military services' fiscal 1991information resources management budgets.andM;Political shifts in eastern Europe have resulted in the expectation at homethat the Defense Department will spend far less.andM;&quot;It's clear to me that the public and the Congress expect an enormous peacedividend and that will come mainly from DOD,&quot; said Nina G. Cornett, theNavy's acting director of IRM.andM;Cornett was one of the speakers at the recent fiscal 1991 ADP budget briefingin Vienna, Va., sponsored by Government Computer News and Federal SourcesInc.andM;At the same time DOD officials are pushing a plan to consolidate similarsystems under a corporate information management (CIM) plan.andM;Cornett's view was echoed by Col.andP;  DAvid Robinson, chief of the ProgramsDivision of the Army's Office of the Director of Information Systems forCommand, Control, Communications and Computers, and Col.andP;  Robert Murphy,director of programs, budget and Air Force board matters for the assistantAir Force chief of staff.andP;  Both said their service's IRM budgets willincrease slightly this year.andP;  Generally, IRM represents about 2 percent ofeach service's budget.andM;Earmarked BudgetandM;The Defense Department budget request for fiscal 1991 includes $2.65 billionfor Air Force IRM, $2.22 billion for the Navy and $2.95 billion for the Army.andO;robinson said about $700 million of the Army IRM budget is earmarked fordevelopment.andP;  The rest is for operation and maintenance.andM;There is no formula by which events abroad can be used to calculatefluctuations in DOD's IRM budget.andP;  Cornett said two theories collide.andP;  One isthat the sweeping personnel reductions and base closings DOD officials arenow planning will bring a need for more automation, to take the place ofpeople.andM;The other is that IRM will take its fair share of budget hits as the peacedividend grows, as will personnel and weapons systems.andP;  Recent evidence canbe used to support either theory depending on what budget or which year iscited, Cornett said.andM;Although the impact of political changes is unknown, the CIM initiativealready has left service officials with millions less to spend on IRM.andM;Murphy said the CIM plan to consolidate like requirements across the servicesinto single systems will cost the Air Force about $1 billion during the nextfive years.andM;Similar amounts will be diverted from Navy and Army budgets between now and1995, a period during which CIM efficiencies are expected to result in a $2billion savings.andP;  To date, the services have paid their CIM bills with moneyonce intended for start-up programs, which Murphy called &quot;casualties of CIM.&quot;andM;Certainly this rob-from-PEter-to-pay-Paul process can be expected tocontinue.andP;  Willie Garrett, chief of the Defense Communications Agency's IRMpolicy office, said CIM came as a result of &quot;a revitalized interest instandardization that people are taking very seriously.&quot;andM;&quot;Until we get some feel for CIM, you won't find us investing heavily in newprograms for hardware or operating software,&quot; Cornett said.andP;  &quot;In the 1990s,the action will be at OSD [the Office of the Secretary of Defense].&quot;andM;The question that Cornett and otehrs cannot yet answer is what form CIM willtake.andM;Four Navy initiatives under the Computer-Aided Acquisition and LogisticsSupport (CALS) program have already been budgeted as departmentwide programsthrough the CIM central fund.andP;  That move has given rise to speculation thatDOD officials will formally name existing start-up programs as CIM systems.andM;But OSD has not established a formal method of making such selections.andP;  As ofnow, CIM working groups are examining requirements only.andM;The Navy's CALS initiatives, according to one DOD official, were accepted inpart merely to show the Army and Air Force that departmentwidestandardization is a meaningful effort and they ought to sign on.andM;They have.andP;  The same  service officials who lament their CIM casualties alsonow speak wishfully of &quot;CIM candidates,&quot; those systems they continue todevelop in the hope that DOD will choose them as the departmentwide &quot;best ofthe breed.&quot;andM;Also, an official recently said the Air Force has begun consolidating many ofits own systems in advance of OSD's development of final requirements for themajor administrative computing functions under CIM.andP;  This consolidation, theofficial said, is meant to give the service a leg-up in what is apparentlybecoming a CIM sweepstakes.andM;&quot;But it costs money to consolidate systemes, and I don't think that's whatthe CIM initiative was meant to do,&quot; the official said.andM;With CIM hitting them from one side and changing defense requirements fromthe other, service budget officials are understandably short on answers topointed questions.andM;At the fiscal 1991 briefing, a bewildered industry representative asked whereexactly within DOD his company's sales staff should go in search of newbusiness.andM;The only easy answer to that one, said Cornett, Robinson, Murphy and Garrett,is that they are not sure.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
