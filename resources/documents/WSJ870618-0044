Many traders expect a relatively short session of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, with the cartel maintaining its official price of about $18 a barrel, controlling output and sustaining price stablity.    Short covering, or buying contracts to offset those sold earlier, continues to characterize futures trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange, traders said, noting that open interest, or the number of contracts outstanding, has fallen in recent days.    &quot;The shorts have been saying, 'enough's enough, we're just going to get out,'&quot; said Bud de Gorgue, an oil broker at E.D. andamp; F. Man International Futures Inc. in New York.    Crude oil for July delivery at the New York Merc rose 12 cents a barrel to $20.39, and heating oil futures prices also rose.    However, unleaded gasoline contracts fell. Some analysts suggested that the weakness in gasoline prices may have stemmed from the modest rise in weekly U.S. gasline inventories reported by the American Petroleum Institute.    Meanwhile spot, or noncontract, crude oil prices posted gains. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose 15 cents a barrel to $20.40, while July North Sea Brent, the barometer of European prices, edged up 12 cents a barrel in late trading to $18.95.    Some analysts said the current $18 OPEC price roughly equals the current $20 price of U.S. crude with transportation, carrying costs and difference in quality factored in.    The value of West Texas Intermediate &quot;is indicating a stable price for OPEC crude,&quot; said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.    Trading activity continues to be quiet. &quot;The market has been characterized by a lack of selling rather than by relentless buying,&quot; said a New York futures trader.    In the meantime, persistent concerns about the Persian Gulf have lent background support to prices, some analysts said. Many traders believe that U.S. protection of Kuwaiti tankers, for instance, could lead to increased tensions in the area.    &quot;Traders are continuing to keep one eye on the screen and the other on the Petroleum Gulf,&quot; said Mr. Beutel.    Prices of crude oil for immediate delivery were also being propped by near-term supply concerns stemming from last month's disruption of a major U.S. pipeline, some analysts said. The Basin pipeline, which carries about 400,000 barrels of crude a day from Texas to Oklahoma, was closed for more than a week after damage from severe flooding.    Some traders are concerned the shutdown may result in tight crude oil availability for small refiners, which could spur higher postings, or the prices refiners pay for crude oil.    In other futures markets yesterday:    STOCK INDEXES: Prices were mixed in lackluster trading as market participants focused on Friday's expiration of index futures and options and individual stock options. With some index contracts moving to a Friday morning settlement and others settling at Friday's close, many market participants predict confusion. Stock-index futures analysts at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. say traders nervous about the expiration have already rolled out of the expiring June contract and into the September contract. Open interest in the June Standard andamp; Poor's 500 contract is already far below the final open interest of 50,058 contracts when the March contract expired, the analysts say. Meanwhile, two factors work against a market decline Friday, said Donald Selkin, head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. The lack of attractive premiums of futures over the indexes in recent weeks meant few arbitrage programs could be set up, Mr. Selkin said. As a result, there are few positions to &quot;unwind&quot; by selling stocks and buying futures, he said. Meanwhile the June Value Line index contract is at a premium over the cash index after trading at deep discounts for weeks, Mr. Selkin said. That means investors expect a &quot;late-minute spurt&quot; in many of the stocks that make up the index.    COFFEE: Futures prices finished at the day's lows after giving up early gains. That surge reflected advances in London that analysts said were prompted by reports of cold weather in Brazilian coffee-growing regions. When the reports weren't confirmed, the market returned to its bearish fundamental condition and retreated, an analyst said. &quot;We couldn't track down the reports,&quot; said a New York dealer of Brazilian coffee. &quot;We talk to Brazil several times a day, and no one down there has mentioned cold weather,&quot; he said.    COPPER: Futures prices fell the second session in a row. Some analysts said they saw signs that the tightness in supplies for near-term delivery was easing; it has been a factor in recent months. In particular, traders are taking their cue from a narrowing of the premium of July prices over deferred months, said Elders Futures' William O'Neill. Usually the more deferred a contract is, the higher the price. The July contract settled at 70 cents a pound, down 0.8 cent a pound. &quot;The July premium narrowed for the third straight day, and traders are closely watching the premiums as an indicator of the tightness of copper supply,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said. &quot;From the way the switching out of July is going, with a narrowing of premiums, it doesn't look like the strength we saw in July will be carried over into September.&quot;    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Forecasts of rain in the northwestern section of the Corn Belt sent corn and soybean futures prices tumbling. Trades are being made from &quot;moment to moment on the perceived weather situation,&quot; said Mickey Luth, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago. Prices soared Monday because of hot, dry weather throughout much of the Corn Belt, and thundershowers that occurred in parts of Iowa and Minnesota during yesterday's session made traders nervous, analysts said. Meanwhile, wheat futures fell further yesterday as harvesting of the winter wheat crop continued. </TEXT></DOC>
