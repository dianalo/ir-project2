World travelers these days need more than a star; they needguidelines on where to go, what to see, where to stay, where toeat. There are plenty of specialized publishers willing to providedirection.   Some, far from all, of the newer travel guidebooks:   Fodor's ``London Companion,'' by Louise Nicholson, a revised andupdated version originally published as ``London: LouiseNicholson's Definitive Guide.'' Walking tours, shopping and diningadvice and ``how to stay dry and have fun on rain-drenched days'' -including ``shop for the anti-rain kit'' and spend the day at theBritish Museum.   Fodor's guide of ``Europe's Great Cities,'' keyed to 1990, is abasic look at 20 cities, from Amsterdam to Zurich. In addition tospecific information on the cities, it lists government touristoffices for each of the countries, as well as some tour groups andpackage deals for independent travelers.   The travel company also has published ``Great Britain: England,Scotland and Wales'' and specific guides for Maui and Washington,D.C.   Fodor's new ``The Himalayan Countries'' offers information onplanning the trip (``what to pack,'' ``passports and visas'') andgetting there as well as specifics on the countries: Bhutan, Nepal,North India, North Pakistan, Tibet.   Chronicle Books published the fifth edition of guides to lessexpensive places, ``Cheap Sleeps in Paris'' (not the cheapest, butthe best values for a variety of tastes, and in which ones isEnglish spoken) and ``Cheap Eats in Paris'' (125 cafes, bistros,brasseries and restaurants), both by Sandra A. Gustafson. Theauthor notes that ``no hotel can purchase a listing or ask to beincluded'' in her ``Sleeps'' guide.   Handy ``city travel kits'' from Doubleday include ``Seven Daysin London'' and ``Seven Days in Paris,'' and ``Four Days inVenice,'' illustrated guides to the major sights, with pull-outmaps.   Perhaps the best guides to Ireland come from the Irish TouristBoard, which offers a booklet of ``approved'' guest accommodations(bed-and-breakfasts listed by region) and a similar guide to hotelsand guest houses.   Bantam's ``France: 1990,'' broken down by regions, includingParis itself, Normandy, Brittany and the North, the Alps, theMediterranean. Appropriate maps accompany each section, whichemphasize the sights.   A similar guide to Canada 1990 joins the Bantam series, whichincludes Spain, Australia, Great Britain, Hawaii, Italy and Mexico.   Bantam had added San Francisco, Hong Kong and Paris to its cityguides series, which includes London and New York.   The City by the Bay, apparently still among the favorites in thenation, is also the subject of a revised ``The Best of SanFrancisco'' (Chronicle) by Don and Betty Martin.   More thematic travel guides recently published include:   - Pamela Lanier's revised edition of ``Condo Vacations,'' alisting of vacation condominiums in the United States, Hawaii andthe Caribbean.   - Eleanor Berman's ``Traveling on Your Own,'' ideas for groupand solo vacations.   - Rand McNally's magazine-format ``Getaway Guide: GreatEscapes,'' which includes special events across the nation, cityvacations, wilderness explorations and scenic drives, along withroad maps.   - Arthur Frommer's third annual ``New World of Travel'' onalternative vacations.   - ``Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That YouAbsolutely Can't Get Unless You're Over 50,'' by Joan RattnerHeilman (Contemporary) is in its third edition, revised with newinformation about to make your age - if you're past 50 - pay off intravel.</TEXT></DOC>
