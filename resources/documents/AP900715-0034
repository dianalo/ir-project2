(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Conservative Baptists who establishedcontrol over the nation's largest Protestant denomination beganflexing their authority and promptly sparked a clash over pressfreedom.   The fundamentalist-moderate power struggle over the past decadefor control of the Southern Baptist Convention reached a watershedlast month when moderates failed in what was viewed as a last-ditcheffort to balance leadership.   And only about 24 hours after a fundamentalist Texas ministerwas installed as convention president, two editors of the BaptistPress were asked to resign.   They refused, setting up a meeting Tuesday at Baptistheadquarters here that some ministers say will tell a lot about howconservatives plan to lead the denomination's flock of nearly 15million members.   ``We all are waiting to see who's next,'' said the Rev. RoyHoneycutt, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary inLouisville, Ky. ``For all practical purposes, I assume they've nowwon the battle they've set out to win in 1979.''   Ordered to quit were editors Alvin C. Shackleford, 58, and DanMartin, 51. Critics say that under them, the news service hasbecome biased in favor of moderates. Both have asked for time to beheard at Tuesday's hearing of the 77-member executive committee.   Martin said his refusal to quit has put Southern Baptistconservatives in a tough spot: Their coup can't be bloodless.   ``They don't want to fire anybody. That leaves this situation alittle ambivalent,'' he said.   Executive Committee President Harold C. Bennett, who called themeeting, was at a conference in North Carolina and couldn't bereached for comment, a secretary in his office said Friday. He didnot return a phone message left at his Nashville home Sunday.   Newly elected Southern Baptist Convention President MorrisChapman of Wichita Falls, Texas, also was out of town, a staffmember said.   In the past, Baptist debate has centered on religious subjectslike whether the Bible should be considered to be literally true inall respects. But lately is has fallen on secular topics, such asthe amount of coverge Baptist Press has given moderate ministersvs. conservatives.   Television journalist Bill Moyers, a lifelong Southern Baptist,has leaped to the aid of the editors.   In a letter to state Baptist news editors, Moyers attackedHouston judge Paul Pressler, a fundamentalist leader who hasspearheaded the fight against the two editors.   Moyers described Pressler, vice chairman of the 77-memberexecutive committee, as a ``petty tyrant.''   ``He rules the Southern Baptist Convention like a swaggeringCaesar, breaking good men when it pleases him,'' said Moyers, whodefended the editors as unwilling to slant their reporting.   Pressler was out of the country and unavailable for commentbefore the meeting.   The Rev. Fred Wolfe, a pastor at Cottage Hill Baptist Church inMobile, Ala., and executive committee treasurer, said he and fiveothers suggested to Bennett that the editors be ousted.   ``Real or perceived, there's strong feeling among conservativesthat Baptist Press has been pro-moderate in the last 12 years,''Wolfe said. ``I can assure you that Mr. Shackleford and Mr. Martinknew there was a real problem with Baptist Press for a long periodof time.''   Moderates say the problem is that Southern Baptists are beingrequired to share a single viewpoint of their faith.   It's ``like you used to have in factories that stamped outrecords _ same speeds, same size, same song,'' Honeycutt said.   The 44-year-old news service, considered one of the nation'smost open and objective denominational news agencies, serves 400outlets, including 38 independent Baptist state weeklies. Itmaintains bureaus in Dallas; Washington, D.C.; Atlanta; andRichmond, Va.   The Rev. Rick Cagle, an executive committee member from Gadsden,Ala., said the resignation order came because some Baptistjournalists were letting their politics show.   ``You've got a lot of churches who don't even send the Baptistpublications out to their members because they feel they're sobiased,'' Cagle said.   The Rev. J.B. Fowler, who heads the Southern Baptist PressAssociation, disagreed. He accused conservatives of trying toneutralize ideological opponents.   ``In any takeover attempt, regardless of what it is or who itis, one of the things taken over is the press, that it might besilenced,'' said Fowler, editor of the Baptist New Mexican, one ofthe 38 state Baptist papers.   Shackleford said the struggle is as simple, and important, asfree speech.   ``We are basically asking for a right to focus on the realissue, and that is the Baptist right to know,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
