The average yield offered by major banks on a six-month CD of less than $50,000 increased just slightly to 7.94% in the week ended yesterday from 7.92%, according to Banxquote Money Markets, an information service based here. A one-year CD of less than $50,000 yielded 7.90%, up from 7.84%. Six-month and one-year maturities are the most popular among individual investors.    Longer-term yields remain lower than short-term. The average yield on a two-year CD of less than $50,000, for example, was 7.86%, up from 7.77%.    Noberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote, called the latest changes &quot;minor increases&quot; and said he expects yields to &quot;continue to move in a very narrow range at least until the end of summer.&quot;    Interest rates in general have held fairly steady in the past two weeks, following a steady decline since late April. Early in the summer, many economists expected the Federal Reserve to ease credit quickly in response to a declining economy. Recent data, however, have indicated that the economy isn't slowing as much as expected.    At Monday's auction, the yield on three-month Treasury bills declined slightly to 8.27%, while the yield on six-month bills rose slightly to 8.29%.    &quot;Everybody's treading water now,&quot; said Robert J. Hutchinson, senior vice president of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York. &quot;The feeling is that rates have stabilized until Sept. 1, when the next round of economic reports starts.&quot;    In the latest week, the average yield on three-month CDs of less than $50,000 remained at 7.95%. Yields on CDs with maturities of one year and less sold by major brokerage firms declined.    Brokerage firms, which negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose CDs they sell, offer some of the best yields. The average yield on a broker-sold three-month CD, for example, was 8.66%. The average yield on two-year CDs sold by brokers rose nearly a fifth of a percentage point to 8.43%.    Average yields on large-denomination CDs, generally $90,000 and up, also rose. On a three-month CD of more than $90,000, for example, the average yield rose to 8.19% from 8.16%, while on a one-year deposit the average yield rose to 8.13% from 8.06%.    On bank money market accounts, the average yield fell a bit on deposits of less than $50,000, to 6.99% from 7.01%, while on deposits of more than $90,000, it remained at 7.48%. </TEXT></DOC>
