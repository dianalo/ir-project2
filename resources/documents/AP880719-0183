Mohammed Ali Hamadi's rambling denunciation was interrupted byChief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger, who adjourned the session.Hamadi, in a loud, agitated voice, said he would no longer takepart in his trial.   The hijackers seized the plane in June 1985, held 39 Americanscaptive in Beirut for 17 days, and killed U.S. Navy diver RobertStethem.   Scheduled to testify Wednesday is Hamadi's older brother, Abbas,who was convicted of kidnapping two West Germans in Lebanon.   Abbas Hamadi was arrested Jan. 26, 1987 at Frankfurt Airportafter returning to West Germany following the kidnappings of WestGermans Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt. Schmidt was freed inSeptember, but Cordes remains a hostage.   As the trial entered its third week, court officials questionedHamadi about a telephone notebook found on him when he was arrestedalso at Frankfurt Airport on Jan. 13, 1987.   The officials said one of the names in the notebook soundedsimilar to one of the other three alleged hijackers. Mueckenbergerindicated without elaboration that some of the names may have aconnection to bombs or bombings in France.   The court also heard testimony from two customs officials andthree police experts, who described the explosives found inHamadi's baggage when he was arrested in a random check.   As the day's session neared its scheduled end, Hamadi asked thathe be allowed to read a statement which he said would explain hismotives for smuggling explosives into West Germany.   ``It was an evil deed and I condemn it,'' he said, speaking inArabic through an interpreter. ``I condemn the link brought in thiscourt of these explosives with France.''   Under questioning, he refused to say if he knew whether theexplosives he was carrying were to be used in terrorist attacks.   Then Hamadi began to give a rambling condemnation of the UnitedStates and Israel, mentioning what he called the ``interference ofthe United States for many years,'' and citing Hiroshima andVietnam.   At that point, Mueckenberger interrupted Hamadi, saying: ``Thecourt is not the place to hear world history.''   Hamadi's defense lawyers objected and the judge allowed Hamadito continue.   Reading loudly from a written statement, Hamadi went on to callthe United States Israel's greatest ally, ``whose military andpolitical support for Israel is growing.'' He said Israel ``killedtens of thousands of my Lebanese countrymen and destroyed hundredsof homes.''   After Hamadi began to criticize the United States for shootingdown an Iran Air Airbus earlier this month, the judge againinterrupted, saying he wanted to adjourn the trial.   ``I see that it is forbidden for me to read my statement. I seethat I am being treated as a criminal and not as political ...''Hamadi said, breaking off the sentence as the judge formally closedthe session.   Hamadi, speaking in a very agitated voice, then said he wouldrefuse to give any more testimony.   Earlier Tuesday, lawyer Rainer Hamm said TWA pilot John L.Testrake of Richmond, Mo., chief flight attendant Uli Derickson,and flight engineer Benjamin Zimmermann of Cascade, Idaho, hadjoined in the prosecution. None of the three was present Tuesday.   The procedure is common practice in West German criminal trials.Those permitted to intervene in the case are allowed to askquestions during the trial and raise objections, much the same asprosecutors. The procedure also gives them the right to appeal ifthey are unsatisfied with the verdict.   Miss Derickson is credited with preventing any more passengersfrom being killed by talking to the hijackers and diverting theirattention.   Hamm is representing 11 Americans, including Stethem's parentsand former hostages, who have joined in the prosecution.</TEXT></DOC>
