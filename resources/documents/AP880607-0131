Sultan Pio Tem, commissioner of the eastern part of Bahrel-Ghazal region, told reporters the victims were residents ofAweil, northwest of the regional capital Wau. He said the victimsalso included people forced into the town by fierce fighting in the5-year-old civil war.   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army holds 90 percent of thecountryside in the south. The government retains control of thelarge towns and cities, and many peasants have fled to them seekingarmy protection.   Tem said the latest telegram he received from Aweil reported 786people had died from hunger and hunger-related diseases from May 24to June 1.   He said 210 others perished earlier from the same causes and thatstarvation deaths continue to occur there daily. He did not say howmany were dying each day.   Tem was in Khartoum seeking relief food for the town. He said hewas to meet with Darios Beshir, Bahr el-Ghazal's regional govenor.Tem said relief supplies had not reached Aweil since a consignmentof rice and edible oil arrived by train a year ago.   Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi has not replied to an appeal forfood and medicine addressed to the government and to Western relieforganizations, Tem said, adding he was trying to meet with el-Mahdito urge him to declare Aweil a hunger area.   El-Mahdi has announced that the United Nations is sponsoring aprogram to transport relief food to the south, but no date has beenset for the operation.   The SPLA took up arms against the government in 1983 to demandmore autonomy and administrative and economic reforms.
