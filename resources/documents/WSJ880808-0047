Lawyers for Mr. Redford said in Los Angeles on Thursday that the actor had received a letter from the Treasury Department asking about his trip to Cuba.    &quot;I wouldn't really call it an investigation. They sent a letter and we told them the facts,&quot; said attorney Vincent Chieffo.    Mr. Redford, 50, has said he made the trip to take part in a scriptwriting workshop for women. He said he chatted briefly with Cuban President Fidel Castro during his Havana stay. </TEXT></DOC>
