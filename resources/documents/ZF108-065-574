DVORAKandM;I was going through some papers recently when I came across this missive fromWilly Chaplin of the Minneapolis-based Dream Machine.andP;  It's a sad tale, butit speaks volumes about our reaction to computers and how we might want toreconsider them.andM;&quot;With this letter I place into the public domain a program idea: to producean engine that will translate business correspondence from any one naturallanguage to any other.andM;&quot;I've been working on this idea since 1964 at Honewell, while taking part inone of the first AI research projects in corporate America.andP;  The people Iknow with money don't understand the concept.andP;  The people who grasp theimportance of this program have no money.andP;  I am currently 53 years old and amnot getting any younger.andM;&quot;As I write these words, my eyes get a bit watery.andP;  It's difficult to let goof something you've been nourishing for so long.andP;  So, before I give you themeat, here's some background.andM;&quot;I've had many technical jobs and learned many languages.andP;  One of the best ofthese jobs was for Honeywell as an AI expert.andP;  In those days (1964 to 1967)AI consisted almost entirely of pattern recognition for military devices(e.g., smart bombs).andP;  But many in AI, myself included, were excited about theprospect of using computers to translate natural language.andP;  Rosy predictionswere made about the imminence of computer translation.andP;  How wrong we were!andM;&quot;Natural language proved to be far more difficult to handle than anyone--fromlinguists to computer experts -- had anticipated.andP;  With each new developmentin the field the problem seemed to grow more complex.andM;The problems with language in general apply to all sorts of writing: Peopleuse strange constructions.andP;  They don't spell correctly, and their grammar isoften idiosyncratic.andP;  People even make up their own words.andM;&quot;Then came the key idea.andP;  Suppose we allow people to say only certain thingsin certain ways.andP;  Sort of a generalized word processor merge file boilerplateoperation.andM;&quot;That's the key.andP;  Suppose you built an expert system that allowed the user tocompose business correspondence by answering a series of questions or byfilling in the blanks in sample sentences.andP;  If this process could be made assimple, or nearly as simple, as writing the letter from scratch on a modernword processor (with all its shortcuts), then the process of translating allthe letters this system can produce into one other language will be reducedto translating the expert system.andP;  One time only for each language!andM;&quot;Of course there are complexities.andP;  Infections and style must be incorporatedfor each language.andP;  Variety and randomness must be generated to keep theoutput from looking boilerplated.andM;&quot;There you have it.andP;  Now to proceed .andP;  .  .&quot;andM;I was impressed with Willy's notion because it reaffirms a basic premise ofhardware and software design: in many instances people have to adpt to thelimitations of the machines.andP;  That's why we are forced to program instead ofjust telling a computer what we want.andM;Industry pioneer Lee Felsenstein likes to equate this dilemma with yellinggee and haw to a horse to get it to move right or left.andP;  The horse simplycan't understand the words turn right or go left.andP;  We have to adapt ourlanguage to the limitations of the horse.andM;This concept says that if we want to have a computer translate for us, wehave to adjust language on our side of the translation.andP;  We have to limitwhat we say and how we say it.andP;  People may balk at the idea, convinced thecomputer will eventually solve all our problems.andP;  But allow me this analogy:cars can go hundreds of miles an hour, but we have to control them with speedlimits.andP;  They can't control themselves.andP;  And while some of the promises ofhigh-speed transportation have never been met, cars still do a wonderful job.andM;Adapting controls for our language is like a speed limit that will makeuniversal linguistic translation a reality.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
