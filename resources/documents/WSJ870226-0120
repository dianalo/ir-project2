Bill Clay (D., Mo.) and Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.) propose in the nicely named Family and Medical Leave Act that employers of 15 or more be required by federal law to provide new mothers and fathers up to 18 weeks of leave with health benefits intact and a guarantee of returning to their position at the same salary. The measure, which yesterday faced hearings before the House Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations, also provides for a study of the advisability of mandating paid leave. The bill, according to its sponsors, would establish &quot;important protection for the rights of workers and families,&quot; since &quot;most employers have failed to adapt their leave policies to the needs of workers.&quot;    This appeal to workers is a twist on the traditional one from the Democratic left, which is usually aimed at blue-collar workers and what the left sees as an American proletariat pitted against big business. Instead, it is creating an issue, looking to incorporate the block of voters known as &quot;yuppies.&quot;    Democrats have done well by exploiting the social programs evolved during the &quot;Great Society&quot; years to create new programs that give more voters a vested interest in the election of Democrats. But yuppies don't need the government's money and have an almost universal skepticism toward government involvement in their lives. Enter parental leave, or &quot;yuppie welfare.&quot;    The median income for families in which both parents work is $34,560 (vs. $23,562 for families with a sole provider). People on the lower side of the median cannot afford the luxury of 18 weeks of unpaid leave to &quot;bond&quot; with their children. This bill would ensure only that professional couples at the higher end of the family income scale will be able to take extended vacations with their newborn children while the federal government ensures that their salaries and positions are retained.    And what of those couples who've chosen to forestall childbearing? These couples, along with single people and those who already have raised families, also would be required to carry a parental-leave policy, forcing them to relinquish other benefits, such as higher pay or a better pension plan. A mandatory parental-leave benefit would not increase the size of benefit packages, but rather limit the size and number of other benefits.    Reps. Clay and Schroeder write: &quot;In 1970 less than 30% of women with children under two years old worked outside the home. Today, almost 50% of women with children under one year of age are working and the percentage is continuing to grow.&quot; These changing demographics, they say, demonstrate the need for their legislation. They miss the point that if hiring practices and benefits packages had not met the needs of families with both parents working, their numbers would not have nearly doubled in 15 years.    Parental leave is not a grass-roots issue born in response to irresponsible employment practices. Yuppies constitute a large portion of my constituency, but since the introduction of the Family and Medical Leave Act a year ago I've heard from only six constituents asking me to vote for it. Some of my more senior colleagues tell me they had never received a letter suggesting the urgent need for federal parental-leave legislation before groups inside the Washington Beltway began pushing it.    Requiring employers to offer parental leave would set a dangerous precedent in employee-management relations. Most employee benefits are not federally mandated. Employers are required only to provide workers' compensation, unemployment compensation and half of Social Security.    A recent survey of 1,000 firms by the National Chamber Foundation, a nonprofit, educational foundation affiliated with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, found that 77% had formal or informal parental-leave policies. Of the remaining 23%, more than two-thirds said their employees preferred other benefits. Congressional proponents of the bill are choosing to ignore the positive steps already being taken, voluntarily, by American businesses in this area.    Say my colleagues Schroeder and Clay: &quot;Despite this revolution in the structure of the family, the United States, alone among industrialized societies, has no national policy regarding parental and medical leave.&quot; This statement reminds me of my children wanting to do something wrong and justifying it with &quot;but everyone else is doing it!&quot;    Rep. Schroeder argues that &quot;Child-rearing experts agree that the early months of a natural or adopted infant . . . are an important time for the new family to cement its relationship.&quot; As a father I can agree with that. As a congressman, I cannot agree that it is my job to pass laws to induce &quot;bonding.&quot; The negative effects of government attempts at social engineering are too many to ignore. And we ought not ignore the costs to those employees who have no need for or cannot afford to take advantage of the parental-leave option but would be required to carry the load for those who do.    Should parental leave in its current form become law, the points I'm making in opposing it now will be made by its advocates in a future Congress. But they will use them to push for paid parental leave.    ---   Rep. Armey (R., Texas), an economist, is a member of the House Education and Labor Committee's Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations. </TEXT></DOC>
