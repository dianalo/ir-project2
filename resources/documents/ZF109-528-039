 Human resourcesdepartments in the past have had to rely on mainframe softwarecontrolled by the information systems department, a methodfeasible only in larger organizations; microcomputers allow evensmall businesses to automate payroll.andP;  Microcomputer-based humanresources information systems (HRIS) packages link together allhuman resource functions into a single system resembling arelational database.andP;  A modular HRIS can be purchased asindividual components, letting companies migrate human resourcesfunctions to microcomputers gradually.andP;  HRIS modules can includepayroll, profit sharing, insurance, health benefits and employeeand application tracking.andP;  HRIS and payroll functions are becomingmore and more integrated, according to observers.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Personnel managementMicrocomputersTrendsDirectoriesSoftware packages.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Caroline HallidayandM;Modular software that automates many human-resources functions has migratedfrom the mainframe to the PC, resulting in improved efficiency and controlfor human-resources departments.andM;A human-resources system has a wide array of functions, including anythingthat deals with records relating to people.andP;  The people tracked can includeemployees, past employees and applicants; records tracked can includedocuments relating to correspondence, recruitment, payroll, benefits, safety,employer relations and labor relations.andM;Until recently, at many companies people were tracked manually.andP;  The firstautomated function was often payroll on the mainframe.andP;  The mainframe wasused to perform number crunching and printing of checks.andP;  While preferable tomanual methods, using mainframes meant that the human-resources departmentlost control of the function to the information-systems (IS) department.andM;&quot;In the past, human-resource information was typically tracked onmainframes,&quot; said David Mahal, president of DGM Associates in Marina Del Rey,Calif., which publishes HR/PC, a journal on personal computing forhuman-resources managers.andP;  &quot;Small companies did it by hand, but larger-sizedcompanies used mainframes to help them manage this information.&quot;andM;Since the introduction of PCs, more human-resources functions have becomeautomated.andM;Increasing health insurance costs have forced companies to offer flexiblebenefits such as cafeteria-style health plans, where employees can opt fordifferent plans depending on their individual needs.andP;  These factors have alsoshown the need to automate much of the human-resource process.andM;Reporting needs have also encouraged the standardization of reports.andP;  Forexample, information sent to federal agencies must be on the appropriateform.andP;  While all companies have their own reporting formats, an increasingnumber of forms are standard across companies, allowing human-resourcessoftware to be more general in purpose.andM;Rather than using the PC in the human-resources area only for spreadsheetsand word processing for reports, many companies are opting for humanresources information systems (HRIS).andM;HRIS software links together all the human-resource functions into a single,relational-databaselike system.andM;These programs are often modular, and can be bought as individual componentsor whole systems.andP;  This allows companies to gradually move human-resourcesfunctions to the PC.andM;These systems can be as simple or complex as necessary.andP;  Modules offered mayinclude payroll, profit sharing, pension, COBRA insurance, health benefits,and employee and applicant tracking.andM;Payroll has been generally the last human-resources function to migrate tothe PC from the mainframe.andM;Some vendors are seeing a new direction in the lines of responsibility andmanagement of payroll and human-resources data.andM;&quot;A trend has started where the payroll and HRIS functions are beginning to beorganizationally integrated.andP;  The same department is becoming responsible forboth functions,&quot; said Ron Groess, president of the Association of HumanResources Systems Professionals and benefit systems manager at 3M in St.andO;Paul, Minn.andM;Mahal agreed: &quot;In the last few years, new functions have emerged for thehuman-resources department.andP;  A new, more specialized, MIS-level job [on parwith a LAN manager] has evolved that is responsible only for HRIS.&quot;andM;Rather than the human-resources department having to wait for IS to runpayroll on the mainframe, the current PC-based payroll programs can use asingle PC or networked PCs, leaving the human-resources department withcomplete control.andP;  In some cases, an intermediate step is needed, whereinformation is downloaded from the mainframe, manipulated on the PC and thenuploaded again for final processing.andM;While giving human-resources departments more flexibility, the PC-basedsolution also keeps sensitive payroll and personnel information within thedepartment, providing better security.andM;3M's Groess suggested that the transition to a PC-based automated humanresources system depends on the company's history.andM;&quot;If previous records were kept manually, the PC-based HRIS modules could beused without customization.andP;  If [companies are] looking to upgrade, the HRISwill need customizing either by the vendor or MIS department.andP;  However, thecurrent HRIS systems are easy to customize,&quot; he said.andM;Once installed, the HRIS modules do not require highly technical skills.andO;Even customization is possible without resorting to high-cost programmingtime.andM;HRIS systems are sophisticated, specialized, database-management systems.andM;A database-management approach allows data to be shared between modules,improving accuracy and reducing input time.andM;However, the individual modules and programs are self-sufficient.andP;  Automatinga single human-resources operation can complement other existing proceduresrather than replacing them.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
