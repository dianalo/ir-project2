Disagreement on tools, testing,and manufacturing persist. (includes a related article on theeconomic potential of the multichip module market)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Ohr, Stephen.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Those eager to employ multichip module (MCM) packaging still havea number of obstacles to overcome.andP;  Many observers believeavailable computer-aided design (CAD) tools lack support for thephysical requirements of these high-speed packages, while an evengreater number cite a lack of both adequate testing facilities andvolume manufacturing methods.andP;  specifically pointed out are adearth of adequate tools for placement, routing, and photomaskdesign, and the need for tighter integration of layout andsimulation software and provision of output capable of drivinghigh-volume manufacturing.andP;  Tool vendors defend their overallprogress, with some reservations, and the recent Design AutomationConference saw a number of introductions, including Valid'sAllegro-MCM tool suite, Mentro Graphic's Hybrid Station Router,and the announcement of the Microelectronics and ComputerTechnology Corp consortium's Packaging Integration Experiment,aimed at development of CAD tools.andP;  None of these announcementsaddress the second major problem of MCM module development, thelack of testing and high-volume manufacturing techniques, andwhile several possible manufacturing techniques have beensuggested, there is as yet no clear idea how to test MCMs, norwhether the modules will be reparable.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     ModulesProduct DevelopmentTestingManufacturingComputer-Aided DesignDesignPackaging.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotographgraph.andO;Caption:   Multichip module costs vs PCBline density and layers 1990 - 1994.andO;(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
