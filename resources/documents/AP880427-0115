Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said the number of strikers atthe Lenin steel mills outside Krakow grew to at least 2,000 sincethe strike began Tuesday. He said a bus drivers' strike inBydgoszcz on Monday ignited demands for drivers' pay increases inother cities.   Ewa Kaberna, a Solidarity activist in Stalowa Wola in southeastPoland, announced a call for a strike at the start of the firstshift Friday at the 18,000-worker heavy machinery plant there forpay increases of $50 a month.   In a statement issued in Gdansk, Walesa said: ``Our unionappeals to all living social forces ... for the undertaking ofunited actions to put pressure on the authorities.   ``At the moment, we need a new policy which would fully answerthe questions worrying Polish families and which would restoresociety's ... rights,'' he said. ``Millions of people are waitingfor restoration of the rights of their trade union, Solidarity.''   The labor unrest appeared to be the most serious in Poland sincethe December 1981 martial-law crackdown suppressed the Solidarityindependent labor federation, which remains banned although itsleadership is still active.   Strikes over higher prices have a long tradition in postwarPoland and caused government shakeups in 1956, 1970 and 1980, whena wave of strikes helped give rise to Solidarity.   Urban, in a telephone interview, said the government haspredicted ``pay-related conflicts. So it is true that the strikesmay spread.''   ``The situation in Poland is getting hotter and hotter. Anythingcan happen any place,'' Walesa told reporters Tuesday in Warsaw.   The steel strike began one day after a strike by 2,800 transitworkers in the western city of Bydgoszcz shut down buses and tramsfor 11 hours and won a 60 percent increase in hourly wages.   Urban said city transit workers in Lodz, Torun and Grudziadzasked for raises in the wake of the Bydgoszcz settlement and thatnationwide talks were planned with official transit unionrepresentatives Thursday.   He said about 2,000 people were on strike at midday at the Leninmill in a ``peaceful and matter-of-fact'' atmosphere. Oppositionspokesmen estimated the number of strikers as 70 percent to 80percent of the 10,000 first-shift workers.   Workers rejected an offer broadcast over loudspeakers at thestart of the afternoon shift for a $50 monthly raise to be phasedin by October, Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron said in Warsaw.   Workers originally sought increases of $30 a month but laterraised their demands to an immediate 50 percent raise, Kuron andother opposition activists said. Monthly pay now averages about$105, union activists said.   The talks also concern the economic condition of retirees andthe state of the national health service, said Zbigniew Lenyk, anopposition spokesman in Krakow.   Urban said negotiations were taking place between workerrepresentatives and plant management.   In his statement, read over the telephone by Solidarity nationalspokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Walesa said Solidarity has beencalling attention to the lack of improvement in the economy formonths.   ``Growing feelings of harm and hopelessness are causing strikeactions,'' he said. ``Solidarity fully supports actions in defenseof living standards.''   In addition to higher wages, a strike committee formed at the32,000-worker plant in Nowa Huta demanded amnesty for strikers,news coverage of the walkout and reinstatement of workers fired forpast union activities.   The state-run news agency PAP, on its English-language service,today carried its first report on the Nowa Huta strike and saidplant managers should resist the strikers' demands. There were noPolish-language media reports on the strike.   Stanislaw Sitkowski, the head of the officially sanctioned unionat the Lenin works, today said many members of his union weretaking part in the strike. ``We are of the opinion that wages aretoo low,'' he said.   The steel mills comprise the main industry in Nowa Huta, a citybuilt outside Krakow after World War II as a model of socialistsociety.   Prices climbed 42 percent in this year's first quarter, thegovernment says, mainly as the result of a government economicreform program that aims to make prices more realistic, in part byreducing subsidies for staples.   But the higher prices have led to demands for pay raises.</TEXT></DOC>
