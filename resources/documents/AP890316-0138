The estimate by Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford duringcongressional testimony was the first public acknowledgement by theadministration of the scope of its new initiative, which wasunveiled last week by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.   The administration's effort, which represents a major switch inU.S. policy, got the endorsement Thursday of Federal ReserveChairman Alan Greenspan, who issued a statement expressing fullsupport for the principles behind Brady's proposal.   However, many members of Congress remained unsatisfied with boththe amount of detail the administration was willing to provide andalso with major elements of the administration's debt-forgivenessproposal.   While praising President Bush for at least doing more than theReagan administration, Democrats in both the Senate and Housecharged that the Bush initiative lacked the boldness needed to solvethe pressing problems of poverty that have engulfed Latin America ina new wave of political and economic instability.   ``We need more,'' Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., told Mulford. ``Moredetails, more careful thinking and bolder internationalinitiatives.''   But Mulford, who testified before a Senate Banking subcommitteeand later to a House Banking subcommittee, asked members of Congressto give the plan a chance to work.   He said that the plan's initial success could be determined bythe first week in April, when the 151-nation World Bank andInternational Monetary Fund meet in Washington to discuss ThirdWorld debt matters.   After the Reagan administration refused for years to endorse anybroad-based efforts at debt forgiveness, the Bush administration hasnow put forward a plan that encourages banks to voluntarily forgivepart of the debt owed to them by Third World countries.   The Brady Plan, as it was being called during the hearings, movesaway from the so-called 1985 Baker Plan, named for Brady'spredecessor at Treasury and now Secretary of State James A. BakerIII.   Mulford said that the Brady proposal projected a possible 20percent reduction in the debt owed by 39 Third World countries andan additional 20 percent reduction in the amount of debt interestpayments these countries would be required to make over the nextthree years.   The 39 developing countries, which include the largest debtornations and many of the smaller ones, collectively owe $340 billion.A 20 percent reduction in that debt over three years would total $70billion with another $20 billion in relief coming from a 20 percentreduction in the estimated $102 billion in interest payments thesecountries would be required to make over the next three years.   Mulford stressed that these projections were only rough estimatesand would vary widely from country to country.   A country like Mexico, generally considered a ``good'' debtornation because it has strived to implement necessary economicreforms, could ``considerably exceed,'' the 20 percent estimate,Mulford said.   On the other hand, he said that some countries might realize nodebt reduction at all if they fail to implement needed economicreforms.   ``It is very important not to get pinned down on a specific setof numbers because numbers invariably raise expectations or depressexpectations, depending on one's point of view,'' Mulford said.   He was responding to questions concerning a report in Thursday'sWall Street Journal, which said the Treasury Department estimateshad been provided privately in meetings with representatives ofcommercial banks.   Several members of Congress expressed qualms that the Brady plandid not go far enough in providing debt relief, especially in LatinAmerica, where living standards have been falling since the debtcrisis first erupted seven years ago.   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said the flood of refugees and illegaldrugs into the United States was directly related to the growingpoverty in the region. He said the only surprise in thedebt-triggered riots which left 300 dead two weeks ago was that theyoccurred in Venezuela, ``one of the most prosperous countries in theregion.''   The Brady plan was endorsed Thursday by Greenspan, whosestatement was issued after several reports of a behind-the-scenesbattle between the Federal Reserve and the administration over theproposal.   In his statement, Greenspan said, ``I fully support theprinciples put forward by Secretary Brady last Friday for helpingthe heavily indebted countries to resolve their economic andfinancial problems. ... The challenge ahead for all of us is toreinvigorate the process and ensure that it works.''   As part of his testimony, Mulford also released several reportssaying the administration opposed establishing an internationalagency to facilitate the writing off of debt.   He said that the resources of the IMF and World Bank weresufficient to handle the problem and a new agency was not needed.   Under the Brady plan, both organizations would support directdebt relief and would provide guarantees covering the reduced debtremaining after the write-offs.</TEXT></DOC>
