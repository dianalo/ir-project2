Justification<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Necessity of Data Collection</ITAG>The Office of Regulatory Analysis of the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration (OSHA) is collecting data to support an assessment of thetechnological and economic feasibility of a standard to protect workersfrom occupational exposure to certain bloodborne diseases, primarily thehepatitis B virus (HBV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Healthcare and certain other workers are at increased risk for certain infectiousdiseases due to their exposure to blood and other potentialy infectiousbody fluids. Occupational exposure takes place in a variety of ways, themost common being injuries from needles and other sharp instruments andthe contamination of open wounds from blood splash. These exposures arecommon, not just in medical personnel but in workers indirectly involvedin the handling of potentially infectious body fluids.OSHA has at this time no specific standard regulating exposure to biologicalhazards such as viruses. In 1983 the agency issued guidelines in conjunctionwith the Department of Health and Human Services for reducing the risksof occupational exposure to HBV. In 1988 the agency issued enforcementprocedures providing uniform inspection procedures and guidelines to befollowed when conducting inspections and issuing citations under section5(a)(1) of the Act for occupational exposure to both HBV and HIV.OSHA has developed a proposed section 6(b) rule to protect workers frombloodborne diseases. The proposal includes provision for safe work practices,personal protective equipment, training, post-exposure protocol and, inthe case of HBV, a vaccination program.OSHA's Congressional mandate stipulates that the agency carefully designand study its regulatory proposals. Section 6(b)(5) of the OSHA Act 2dU.S.C. 655 (b)(5) mandates that regulations promulgated by the Agency shallmost adequately assure worker safety and health ``to the extent feasibleon the basis of the best available evidence.'' They are to be based on``research and the latest available scientific data.'' Section 6(f) ofthe Act requires regulations to be justified by ``substantial evidencein the record'' and authorizes the Secretary of Labor ``to enter into contracts,agreements or other arrangements with appropriate public agencies or privateorganizations for the purposes of conducting studies related to his responsibilityunder the Act.'' The courts have endorsed the view that technological andeconomic factors affect the feasibility of proposed regulations. Thus,OSHA is obligated to gather data on the technological feasibility, costof compliance, and economic consequences of future standards.Executive Order 12291 reiterates this obligation by requiring the preparationof preliminary and final Regulatory Impact Analyses for each major rule.The Agency must analyze the potential benefits and costs of the rule andalternative approaches. The Regulatory Impact Analysis may be combinedwith the analysis required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This Actspecifically requires an analysis that describes the ``impact of the proposedrule on small entities'' and significant regulatory alternatives that ``takeinto account the resources available to small entities.''In order to fulfill the Congressional and Presidential mandates and tobetter evaluate the economic and technological feasibility of the finalOSHA standard, OSHA requires a data base that describes current industrypractices and identifies situations where potential hazards exist. Thus,in accordance with Section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Actof 1970, 29 U.S.C. 655, OSHA is planning to gather statistically accuratedata through a survey of hospitals to assess the extent to which hospitalshave already implemented infection control measures to protect workersfrom bloodborne pathogens. These data will enable the Agency to refineits preliminary estimates of the direct and indirect costs associated withthe proposed rule. As discussed below, none of the available data sourcesare fully adequate for this purpose.To estimate accurately the cost of the standard, data are needed on baselinecompliance rates of hospitals for specific provisions of the standard.Currently, much of the data available for estimating the extent to whichhospitals have adopted measures to protect workers from bloodborne pathogensare limited or outdated. In addition, most of the data available to OSHAare not based on a random sample, and thus their accuracy cannot be judged.The data that do exist are for the most part over a year old, and are mostlyfrom large, urban hospitals in areas which report a high incidence of HBVand HIV infection. Moreover, those studies on compliance that exist donot allow an estimate of the extent to which a facility may have adoptedmeasures which would, at least in part, meet the requirements of the proposedstandard.In addition to estimates of compliance rates, data are needed on a varietyof specific aspects of a facility's operation. For example, data on thenumber of incidents of employee exposure to blood or materials contaminatedwith blood are needed to estimate the cost of the post-exposure protocol.A timetable for the survey is presented in Figure A-1. The timetable showsthat OSHA is attempting to complete the survey within a short period oftime in order to permit completion of the final regulatory analysis inconjunction with the final rule. The schedule currently calls for completionof the bulk of the survey effort within a 10-week period. Therefore, werequest that an expedited review be performed by OMB.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s50,xs50</C><T4>Figure</T4> A-1._<T4>Schedule for Design and Completion</T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Complete design of survey instrument and submit information collectionplan to OMB<D>Oct. 6, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Publish <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of survey submission to OMB<D>Oct. 12, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Obtain sampling frames for each sample stratum<D>Oct. 15, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Receive OMB approval of survey (expedited)<D>Nov. 6, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mail notification letters to survey targets<D>Nov. 7, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Begin telephone interviewing<D>Nov. 20, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Complete telephone interviewing<D>Dec. 18, 1989.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Perform data tabulations<D>Jan. 1, 1990.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Integrate survey results into a draft final report<D>Jan. 15, 1990.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Respond to comments and submit final report<D>Feb. 1, 1990.</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Uses of the Information </ITAG>The data gathered through this survey will be used by OSHA to make estimatesof the direct and indirect costs of the various provisions for safe workpractices, personal protective equipment, training, post-exposure followup and HBV vaccination. The information gathered from all of the data collectionefforts will be used by OSHA to prepare a final Regulatory Impact Analysis(RIA) for the final rule. Executive Order 12291 requires preparation ofan RIA for each major rule. In an RIA, the Agency must assess the potentialbenefits and costs of the rule and of alternative approaches. The discussion below describes in detail the data uses for responses toeach set of questions in the survey instrument. A. <T3>Questions on Infection Control Policies.</T3> This set of questionsidentifies the types of infection control policies that have been adoptedby the hospital, including isolation and surgical precautions, as wellas general polices with regard to bloodborne infections. An understandingof the types of policies will provide general indication of the hospital'scompliance level and a quality control check on later responses. B. <T3>Questions on Hospital Employment Structure.</T3> These questions identifyhow many workers are employed by the hospital in each employment category.Employment categories include direct patient care employees, laboratorystaff, and service employees. These questions also identify how many fulltime employees there are in each category. Data from these questions havean important effect on the cost of training and the HBV vaccination programaspects of the proposal. C. <T3>Data of Rates on Employee Exposure.</T3> The next set of questionsask for estimates of the proportion of workers that are potentially exposedto blood or materials contaminated with blood. Data is gathered for eachemployment category mentioned above. Information gathered here is importantin determining how exposure varies among the different employee categories.D. <T3>Questions on Policies for Use of Personal Protective Equipment.</T3>Data are collected on the hospital's policies regarding employee use ofpersonal protective equipment. Estimates are gathered for glove use, includingwhen gloves are to be worn and how often they are to be changed. The dataare specific to different employee categories. Where appropriate, additionalquestions are asked regarding the use of masks, goggles, shields and gowns.These questions are important in determining PPE usage rates and the levelof current compliance. Hospitals covered in this survey were not includedin the OSHA survey on personal protective equipment. E. <T3>Questions on Procurement of Personal Protective Equipment.</T3> Thesequestions gather data on the amounts of personal protective equipment purchasedby the hospital, including gloves, gowns, masks, goggles and face shields.These data are used in determining usage rates for PPE as well as in theestimation of current compliance. F. <T3>Questions on Contract and Unpaid Workers.</T3> These questions identifyhow many contract and unpaid workers are in danger of potential exposureand if they are offered personal protective equipment. This informationis requested because these types of workers technically would not be theresponsibility of the hospital under OSHA's proposed rule; thus, a rigorousanalysis can not be performed without these data. G. <T3>Questions on Hepatitis B Vaccination Policies.</T3> Questions are askedto determine the percentage of exposed workers who have received the HBVvaccine, if the hospital screens employees prior to vaccination, the extentto which these workers are offered the HBV vaccine free of charge, andwhen appropriate, the proportion of workers that accept the vaccine. Datafrom these questions are important in determining costs associated withthe comprehensive surveillance program. H. <T3>Questions on Employee Training.</T3> Data are collected on the length,frequency and timing of infection control training provided to at riskemployees by the hospital. This information will enable the Agency to estimatethe incremental effect of its proposed training provision. I. <T3>Questions on Post-Exposure Protocol. </T3>Questions are asked to determinethe annual number of exposures occurring in the hospital. Further, dataare collected regarding source and employee testing, post-exposure employeecounseling and medical treatment. Data from these questions are integralin determining cost and current compliance with regard to post-exposureprocedures. J. <T3>Questions on Sharps Handling and Infectious Waste Disposal. </T3>Thesequestions deal with current practices with respect to disposal of infectiousitems. Questions are also asked to determine what types of waste the hospitaltreats as infectious. This information is important because the costs ofdisposing of waste designated as infectious are greater than the costsof disposal for non-infectious items. K. <T3>Questions on Laboratory Specific Infection Control Practices. </T3>Dataare collected with regard to centrifuge operation and aerosolization ofinfectious fluids and whether appropriate hazard signs are posted whenconcentrated HIV or HBV samples are in use. These questions are importantfor determining current levels of compliance. L. <T3>Questions on Policies Specific to AIDS and Hepatitis B. </T3>Thesequestions determine if any patient groups undergo routine HIV or HBV screening,how the status of HIV or HBV patients is made apparent, and if such patientsare treated any differently than non-infected patients. These questionsaddress issues of concern to the Centers for Disease Control. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Use of Technology to Reduce Burden</ITAG>Information for this survey will be collected using a Computer AssistedTelephone Interviewing (CATI) system. Such a procedure will improve thequality and efficiency of the survey in a number of ways and will alsoreduce respondent burden. First, since the survey is done via telephone,there is no need for scheduling on-site visits to gather the information.This is expected to increase both the response rate and reduce the costand time of completing interviews. Further, CATI system responses are entered directly into the computer,eliminating the need for separate recording and coding operations. Also,the computer ensures that the proper sequence of questions is followedautomatically. For example, if the response to one question suggest thata follow-up question can be skipped, the computer will automatically moveon. The interviewer simply reads the questions as they appear on the screen.In addition, the use of the CATI allows the interviewer to omit questionsthat would not be relevant for the particular facility being questioned.This system produces a smoothly flowing interview and eliminates any pausesor delays by the interviewer to enter responses by hand or to find thenext question. In essence, the computer produces a questionnaire tailoredto each facility. If, however, the hospital indicates that it prefers tosubmit the information by mail, this method will also be accepted. Thereare no technical or legal obstacles to these plans for reducing the burden.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Efforts to identify Duplication</ITAG>OSHA delayed this effort to allow for full coordination of its activitieswith the Centers for Disease Control and to eliminate the potential forduplication of efforts. OSHA and its contractor, Jack Faucett Associates,Inc., have conducted an extensive literature review and have explored sourceswithin governmental and private agencies for data that are to be collectedfrom these surveys. The findings indicate that there are no attempts togather, in a systematic fashion, data on the work practices and the costsof control measures to protect workers from occupationally related exposuresto bloodborne diseases for the hospitals affected by the rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Availability of Data from Existing Sources</ITAG>More data have been collected that is relevant to the OSHA rulemaking forhospitals than for any other facility type potentially affected by theproposed standard. However, relative to the large proportion of the costsof the standard that hospitals will bear, the current data are not fullyadequate. A number of studies have considered the rates of exposure of health careworkers to infected material, including studies by Marcus, Newberger, McCray,Gerberding, McCormick and others. However, the past studies have focusedon the number of exposure incidents and have generally not provided usefuldata upon which to estimate the total number of exposed workers. Incomplete or out of data data are available on levels of compliance amonghospitals. CDC conducted a survey of hospitals in July of 1985 to measurethe rate of adoption of selected universal precautions policies but thesedata are now seriously out of date. A survey in early 1988 of hospitalsby the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHCO)asked whether the hospitals had adopted procedures that met or were equivalentto the CDC recommendations. These data, however, do not provide the detailrequired to estimate hospitals' current level of compliance with the proposedrule. A survey in 1987 conducted by Celetano for the Association of Practitionersof Infection Control had similar limitations as the JCAHCO survey. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) surveyed workers at avariety of facilities to estimate compliance with various infection controlpractices. The SEIU data were useful in developing the preliminary RIAbut do not cover all the areas of interest. In addition, the small samplesize and non-random selection of facilities in this survey limits the usefulnessof these data. There have been a number of surveys and studies analyzing the cost effectivenessof HBV vaccination programs and the levels of immunization of health careworkers, but data on current vaccination rates are out of date, given anecdotalevidence that many facilities have only recently adopted vaccination programs.Data are also limited on the number of hospitals that offer the HBV vaccinationfree of charge and the types of workers that are offered the vaccine. Regional data are available on infectious waste disposal practices in NewJersey, New York, Pennsylvania and parts of Washington State. Nationaldata, however, are limited. A study by Rutala in July of 1987 and Januaryof 1988 provided national data on hospital infectious waste practices.Given the recent changes in many state laws and regulations and the publicattention given during the summer of 1988 to infectious waste hospitalpractices are expected to have changed significantly. Current detaileddata are needed on the types of waste hospitals are treating as infectiouswaste. CDC collects information regarding the incidence of bloodborne diseasesin their national medical surveillance, but these data lack informationregarding occupationally related exposures to these infections, and donot address current work practices or control costs. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Minimizing Small Employer Burden</ITAG>Approximately one-half of the establishment surveyed are expected to besmall. To reduce the burden on these facilities, both the total numberof facilities surveyed and the number of questions asked have been keptto a minimum. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Consequence of Less Frequent Collection</ITAG>This is a one time only data collection. No plans exist for subsequentperiodic follow up of this study. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Consistency With 5 CFR 1320.6</ITAG>There are no special circumstances that require the collection of informationin any manner inconsistent with the guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Expert Review of the Survey Questionnaire</ITAG>The survey design team has had discussions with industry experts in orderto assess the substance of the survey questions. The clarity of instructionsand other specific survey design elements have been reviewed by contractorsurvey experts, OSHA personnel and expert safety consultants in industry.A. The survey instrument has been reviewed in September of 1989 by:<ITAG tagnum="15">Dr. Hugh Conway, Office of Regulatory Analysis, OSHA, 202-523-9916;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Mr. Larry Braslow, Office of Regulatory Analysis, OSHA, 202-523-9916;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Mr. Robert Andrei, Office of Regulatory Analysis, OSHA, 202-523-9916;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Mr. Jack Smalligan, Jack Faucett Associates, 301-961-8800;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Mr. Ronald Bird, Jack Faucett Associates, 301-961-8800;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Ms. Gina Pugliese, American Hospital Associates, 312-280-5995.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Dr. Robert Hiett, KCA Research, 703-642-5220.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Ms. Jacquelyn Polder, Centers for Disease Control, 404-639-1644</ITAG>B. No major problems arose during this review.C. Public comment will be solicited through the Federal Register noticefor the study.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Confidentiality</ITAG>Procedures have been developed to protect the confidentiality of the collecteddata. These measures are summarized below:A. All contractor and subcontractor personnel will be given instructionsregarding the importance of keeping all information they obtain from respondentsconfidential.B. The data will be collected using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing(CATI) system. This technology enables the survey responses to be automaticallywritten to a computer data file. Neither the name of the company nor therespondent will appear in the data file. A listing of respondents willbe kept separately in a locked file cabinet at the contractor's office,and will be destroyed when no longer needed. The respondents' names willbe linked to the data base through a unique number assigned at the timeof the interview.C. Publications of study results will be of a statistical nature only.Respondents will never be identified in any publication or presentation,nor will their names be made available to other individuals or groups.<ITAG tagnum="81">11. Sensitive Questions</ITAG>The proposed survey instrument contains no questions of a sensitive nature.<ITAG tagnum="81">12. Costs</ITAG>The total one-time cost to the government of the proposed data collectionis $150,000. This estimate includes costs incurred by contractors for administrationand operation of the data collection, tabulation of survey results, andsubsequent analyses. The total one-time cost to the hospitals is estimatedto be $12,556 (using 2 hours per facility for complete responses and 5minutes/facility for screening or refusals).<ITAG tagnum="81">13. Estimate of Respondent Reporting Burden</ITAG>The survey instrument has been designed to allow the respondent to provideestimates and approximations. It is not the intent of the survey to requirerespondents to compile new data. Where data are requested, the survey instrumentsnote that reference is being made to data which the respondent should beable to estimate readily or access easily.It is estimated that 2 hours will be required for the completion of thesurvey. Based on 300 respondents, the respondent burden for completed surveyswill be approximately 600 hours. For non-complete responses (screeningor refusals), the burden will be 14 hours. The total respondent burdenwill be 614 hours.

Tabulation/Publication Timetable </ITAG>The survey results will be placed in the relevant OSHA docket in wholeor in part by OSHA as deemed appropriate as soon as complete computer filesare finalized. Analysis of the data will appear in the final RegulatoryImpact Analysis.B. Statistical Methods 1. Characterization of the Universe and Sample <T3>Universe and Sampling Frame. </T3>The universe of interest for theBlood Borne Diseases (BBD) Hospital Survey consists of all hospitals inthe United States. It includes hospitals of all sizes, publicly as wellas privately-controlled hospitals, and hospitals offering a range of services(e.g., general, psychiatric, and specialty hospitals). For the purposesof this survey, however, state or local government controlled hospitalsin OSHA state plan states are excluded. The sampling frame will be the hospital list marketed by the SMG MarketingGroup, Inc., a company specializing in the health care industry. It isnoted that should any problems arise with implementing the SMG frame, theAmerican Hospital Association (AHA) frame will be used as a backup datasource. The data sources for the SMG list are the records kept by StateHealth Departments. For licensing and other purposes, all hospitals mustfile accurate and up-to-date information with their respective State HealthDepartment. These records are public documents that can be freely and completelyaccessed by private parties. The SMG list, because of its completeness and data origin, is used by anumber of U.S. health agencies for their data-gathering efforts. It isupdated quarterly (the last update was completed in June, 1989), but informationon hospitals which have closed since June is maintained current by feedbackprovided by users of the list. That is, whenever mail with an SMG-generatedmailing label is returned to the sender, either because the facility isnot at the address indicated or because it has closed, SMG immediatelyrecords this information on the data base. The coverage of this list, estimatedat about 95 percent of operating hospitals at any given point in time,is quite good, since it is based on public records and all hospitals licensedin a State must report to the State Health Department. Because the listis in constant use and feedback on closed facilities is incorporated inthe file on an ongoing basis, the expected proportion of ``bad'' listingsassociated with non-operating hospitals at any given point in time is lessthan 5 percent. <T3>Design Overview. </T3>The sampling plan for the BBD Hospital Surveyconsists of a stratified probability sample of 300 hospitals. Two strata,defined on the basis of reported number of hospital beds (the measure ofsize), are used to select the sample. The sampling unit, based on the SMGdata base, is the reporting unit. The two sampling strata are defined bysplitting the hospital frame into two groups at roughly the median of thedistribution of number of beds. The sample of 300 hospitals is allocatedto each size stratum in proportion to the stratum measure of size. To achieveimplicit stratification by geographic region of the country, the file willbe ordered by Census region within strata and a systematic sample selectionwill be carried out independently within each primary stratum. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Information Collection Procedures </ITAG>The information on the BBD Hospital Survey will be collected via CATI withprior mailing of the questionnaire to each sample hospital. (Respondentswill be permitted to submit completed questionnaires by mail if they sodesire.) The survey questionnaire and instructions supplementing the definitionsand explanations appearing on the questionnaire will be mailed to a previouslyidentified contact person (obtained from the SMG listing). The questionnairewill be broken up into information sections to facilitate completion. Thecontact person will be responsible for distributing the different sectionsto the appropriate hospital staff member. This approach allows differentparts of the questionnaire to be answered by the person(s) most knowledgeableabout the particular subject matter, while maintaining a central contactwho will report the results to the telephone interviewers. The initialmailing of questionnaires will be accompanied by a letter of introduction,signed by the Assistant Secretary of Labor. <T3>Effective Sample Size and Precision of Sample Estimates. </T3>The expectedprecision for the overall estimate and the stratum-level estimates wasderived as follows. It is noted here that this approach is a continuationof the methodology employed in the BBD Survey presently being conductedfor eighteen other health care industry sectors (FR Vol. 54, No. 137, Wednesday,July 19, 1989, p. 30330). The actual (i.e., incremental) cost (COST) incurredby a given hospital in order to come into compliance with the proposedstandard may be modeled as the product of two independent random variables.The first variable, Y, relates to the total compliance cost for the establishment.This includes its baseline costs (i.e., those costs the hospital currentlyexperiences as a result of its current health safety policies) plus itsadditional costs stemming from new policies it may be required to implementbased upon the new standard. This total cost is independent of any establishmentpolicy or practice and is derived solely from the characteristics of eachfacility (e.g., numbers of employees, numbers of people treated). The secondvariable, P, measures the hospital's current rate of non-compliance withthe proposed standard. Its values range from 0 to 1. Hence, the incrementalcost to each establishment as a result of the standard may be modeled as:COST<T2>i</T2>=Y<T2>i</T2>andmultiply;P<T2>i</T2>;<ITAG tagnum="20">where,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">COST<T2>i</T2>=Incremental cost to hospital i; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Y<T2>i</T2>=Total compliance cost to hospital i; and P<T2>i</T2>=Current percent non-compliance for hospital i to new standard.</ITAG>Using the assumption of independence of Y and P, the expected value andvariance of this cost may be expressed as: <ITAG tagnum="26">E (COST)=E(Y) * E(P)=Y * P; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Var (COST)=(E(Y))\2\ Var(P)+(E(P))\2\ Var(Y)+Var(P)Var(Y).</ITAG>Having split the total variability in cost into two independent components,one stemming from the variability in facility characteristics and the otherstemming from variability in policy (i.e., current compliance), samplerequirements were estimated based upon various assumptions about the distributionsof each. For the total cost variable, Y, a gamma distribution was assumed, usinga value equal to 3 for the shape parameter. This parameter correspondsto a slightly skewed distribution with moderate variability (CV=0.58).The population coefficient of variance (CV) is defined as the populationstandard deviation divided by population mean. For the non-compliance variable,P, a triangular distribution was assumed with endpoints at zero and one.\1\<NOTE/> The mean of the distribution (expected non-compliance rate)was assumed to be 0.33. The figure is consistent with OSHA's assessmentof current practice in the hospital industry.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Kish, L. <T3>Survey Sampling, </T3>John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1965, p.262.  Using the above parameters for the total cost variable, Y, and the percentnon-compliance variable, P, the incremental cost variable has a populationCV equal to 0.99. Based on this assumed population CV and simple randomsampling selection, a sample size of 300 results in a relative standarderror (RSE) of 0.057 (5.7%) in the survey estimate. The stratum level estimates,based on a sample size of 150 hospitals each, are expected to have a relativestandard error of 0.08 (8%). Specifically, ignoring the finite populationcorrection factor, these estimates were derived from the following standardformula:<ITAG tagnum="26">RSE (Y)=CV<T2>yi</T2>/|n.</ITAG>The number of solicitations required to achieve the target number of 300completed questionnaires from eligible hospitals was estimated by inflatingthis target sample size by the expected number of unsuccessful interviewattempts. These losses are due to non-response (e.g., refusal, languagebarrier, extenuating circumstances existing during the data collectionperiod), the inability to contact a hospital because it has closed, andother unforseen losses. Based on previous experience in hospital surveys,losses due to non-response are estimated at 25 percent, losses due to out-of-businessand other out-of-scope are estimated at 10 percent, and losses due to otherunforseen reasons are estimated at 20 percent. Hence, 462 hospitals willbe asked to participate in the survey and 462 questionnaires will initiallybe mailed to the identified participants. An additional 205 hospitals willbe assigned as a reserve sample. After the losses experienced in the mailingare determined (e.g., number of returned envelopes), subsets of the reservesample will be released as required to achieve the 300 target completedinterviews with eligible hospitals. Specifically, the total number of hospitalsto be initially selected, 667, was estimated by:<ITAG tagnum="26">300andmultiply;1/(1^ (.25+.10+.20))=300andmultiply;(1/.45)=667.</ITAG>Stratification. The expected relative standard errors (RSE) indicated abovewere derived under the assumption of simple random sampling. However, withstratification, the efficiency of the sample may be increased. By identifyingsubdomains of the universe of interest that are more similar among themselveswith respect to the key characteristics to be estimated from the surveyand by selecting independent samples within each subdomain or stratum,the overall variance of the estimates may be reduced. The reduction invariance is a function of the correlation between the stratification variable(s)and the estimates to be produced from the survey. For the BBD HospitalSurvey, number of hospital beds will be used as the primary stratificationvariable. We expect this size measure to be correlated with incrementalcost of compliance with the proposed standard. Stratification may also be used to achieve specific sample sizes for selectedsubdomains of the universe, since sample selection is carried out independentlywithin strata. Thus, estimates for these selected subdomains can also beproduced. Although estimates for the entire hospital sector are of primaryimportance in this survey, estimates by size subdomain are also of interest.Two strata will be identified for sample selection: (1) Hospitals withless than 300 beds, and (2) hospitals with 300 or more beds. These stratumboundaries were defined following the ``CUM square root of frequency''procedure.\2\<NOTE/> For this survey, this rule implies that the two strata willrepresent approximately equal cumulative square root of the measure ofsize (total hospital beds accounted for by the hospitals) in the stratum.The table below  shows how the rule was implemented. It presents the distributionof hospitals by bed size categories reported by AHA, total number of bedsaccounted for by hospitals in the category, and the cumulative square rootof number of hospital beds for the two resulting strata. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Cochran, W.G., <T3>Sampling Techniques, </T3>Third Edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.,New York, I977.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s200,10,10,10,10 </C><T4>Distribution of Hospitals and Beds by Strata.\3\</T4><H1>Stratum </H1><H1>Number of hospital units </H1><H1>Number of beds</H1><H1>Square root (beds) </H1><H1>Cumulative percent of beds</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">6 to 24 beds <D>290 </D><D>5,608 </D><D>75 </D><D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25 to 49 beds <D>1,145 </D><D>42,845 </D><D>207 </D><D>10 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50 to 99 beds <D>1,673 </D><D>120,841 </D><D>348 </D><D>21 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100 to 199 beds <D>1,581 </D><D>222,765 </D><D>472 </D><D>38 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">200 to 299 beds <D>858 </D><D>207,602 </D><D>456 </D><D>\4\ 53 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">300 to 399 beds <D>503 </D><D>172,627 </D><D>415 </D><D>67 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">400 to 499 beds <D>275 </D><D>122,855 </D><D>351 </D><D>79 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">500+beds <D>496 </D><D>371,557 </D><D>610 </D><D>100 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total <D>6,821 </D><D>1,266,700 </D><D>2,933</D><D> </D><F>\3\ ``Hospital Statistics,'' American Hospital Association 1988 Edition,table 3, p. 12. </F><F>\4\ The cumulative percent closest to 50 percent defines the stratumboundary.</F></ITAG></ITAG> Sample Selection Methodology. Sample selection under stratified samplingwill be carried out independently within strata. To implement the selection,the SMG hospital file will be sorted by the primary strata (less than 299beds, and 300 or more beds) and by secondary strata. (Census geographicregion) within bed size. The sort by region within primary strata willachieve a proportional distribution of the within-stratum sample acrossthe four Census regions. The skip interval for the selection within stratumwill be established as the reciprocal of the sampling rate correspondingto the particular stratum. As discussed earlier, a total sample of 667hospitals will be selected. Four hundred   sixty-two (462) hospitals willinitially be contacted. This sample includes additional units to coverlosses due to nonresponse, out-of-scope or out-of-business listings onthe SMG file, and ``bad'' telephone numbers (e.g., ring-no-answer, disconnected).Two hundred five (205) hospitals will be identified as a reserve sampleto cover unforeseen losses. Estimation Procedure. The survey estimator will be selfweighting withinstratum, but sampling weights will be required to produce overall estimatesto account for differential probabilities of selection across the two strata.The overall estimator will take the form:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/>  <H1>Y</H1><H1>=</H1><H1/>S<H2>i</H2><H1>WGT</H1><T2>hi</T2> * NRAF<T2>hi</T2> * RESP<T2>i</T2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="20">where,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">WGT<T2>hi</T2>=the stratum h sampling weight corresponding to hospital i;and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">NRAF<T2>hi</T2>=the stratum h non-response adjustment corresponding to hospitali.</ITAG>The non-response adjustment will be computed within stratum as the ratioof eligible hospitals (indexed by i), weighted by number of beds to cooperatingeligible hospitals (indexed by i*) weighted by number of beds.

Methods to Maximize Response Rates </ITAG>This survey is voluntary and is expected to yield a response rate of approximately75 percent of in-scope hospitals. Every effort will be made to completeinterviews for all in-scope hospitals: Up to five call-backs will be madeto obtain a completed questionnaire. We expect that having identified acontact person at the hospital prior to the call by the CATI interviewerwill facilitate obtaining a completed interview. Also, we hope to obtainan endorsement from the American Hospital Association. If obtained, thissupport will be indicated in our initial contact letter. In addition, theCATI process will help improve the overall response rate by:andbullet; Allowing direct telephone contact with the hospital staff personin charge of reporting responses for all sections of the questionnaire(the central contact person); andandbullet; Scheduling and maintaining a detailed record of the initial solicitationand all call-backs to obtain an interview with the contact person at thehospital.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M039</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-24077 Filed 10-13-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
