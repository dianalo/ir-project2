Two gratingsare studied: One with a ruled profile and the other having a laminarprofile. The laminar profile is shown to reduce substantially the intensityof higher-order diffracted light with only a small decrease in the intensityof the first order light. The dependence of the energy resolution asa function of the area of the grating illuminated is also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
