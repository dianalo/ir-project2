The No. 3 auto maker, which has oversized inventories on many of its models, said it will offer a $770 discount, in the form of a cash rebate, on certain 1987 Dodge Dakota and Ramcharger light trucks, as well as certain 1988 model cars and trucks. The 1988 models affected are the Chrysler Fifth Avenue, the New Yorker Turbo, the Dodge Daytona, certain Dakota trucks and Ram trucks. Additionally, Chrysler will offer financing rates as low as 7.7% to buyers of these vehicles.    Customers who lease any of these models for at least a year under the company's &quot;Gold Key&quot; lease plan will be offered rebates of $770 and low-cost financing, Chrysler said.    As previously reported, Chrysler in November began offering rebates and 7.7% financing on certain leftover 1987 cars and trucks, and cut the base prices on several models, including the 1988 LeBaron Coupe. Chrysler has also moved to cut first-quarter car production 15% from year-earlier levels. Chrysler's car sales were down 6.5% in early December, compared with a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
