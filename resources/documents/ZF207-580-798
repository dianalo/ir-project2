(intellectual property)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Future of ComputingIntellectual PropertyLegislationInformation ServicesOn-LineCodesAbstractingLegal Issues.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Once the country has resolved the issues of look-and-feel and interfaces,it's still not likely to suffer from hordes of unemployed intellectualproperty lawyers, because technology advances will provide them with two newproblems to address  - on-line information packaging and distribution ser-vices, and reusable code in the form of subroutine and class libraries.andM;INFORMATION PACKAGING AND DISTRIBUTIONandM;With some exceptions such as Dow Jones News Retrieval, most on-line servicesare packagers and retailers of information generated by someone else.andP;  Theyare charging in part for the information, but also for the service offinding, filtering and delivering it.andP;  The clearest illustration of this is the dissemination of public-domain information, which you can get from thegovernment &quot;free&quot;  - i.e.andP;  for their cost and your time.andM;The information distributor's work consists of two primary functions.andP;  Firsthe must line up the appropriate information sources and negotiate contractswith each of them.andP;  He must also charge the users appropriately.andP;  Second, hemust provide an interface and tools that enable the users to find preciselythe information they need.andM;PricingandM;This part of the job involves negotiating contracts with each informationsupplier, and determining the appropriate pricing.andP;  Frequently on-linedistribution will be only one means of dissemination of the information.andP;  Thebiggest problem is simply defining the product and the unit of measure.andP;  Isit connect time, access, etc.? What kind of use is to be made of theinformation Can one corporate customer share it with the guy down the hall,his entire department, his entire company, his customers? And how can youcontrol this? Then there's deciding how to charge: Does the informationsupplier get an overall royalty, or is it feasible to charge per access? Orshould you just sell it on a CD ROM and forget the details? What extras suchas fancy filtering and presentation can you charge for? What's the value of adatabase access where the response is  Nothing found&quot;? That could be usefulinformation in a reference check where you were checking for negativeinformation.andM;The same information can be resold many ways and many times  - frequently tothe same customers.andP;  You can get data in real-time, in time-series, andintegrate with other data in statistical analyses.andM;From Juan to Alice to Fred to BillandM;And it can be reused in many ways.andP;  Who owns it, and what interest does heretain, after it's been filtered, massaged and turned into yet anotherdatabase? Can a lawyer send out a fax of a patent he downloaded from Lexpat?andO;What about the same patent he received from the Government Printing Office?andO;All these questions will keep lawyers occupied for years.andP;  Textual dataraises other problems.andP;  What's the legal status of abstracting? For now it'slegal, but what happens when we move towards automatic abstracting,assignment of key words and the like? Is it really okay to buy The New YorkTimes or PC Week, say, for $100 or so a year, and resell summaries forhundreds of dollars? More interesting in the long run is the notion ofassembled texts: Users may end up reading only paragraphs here and there,following links set up by a human editor or an intelligent agent.andP;  Do wereally want to pay royalties by the paragraph? Maybe we do, since it will berelatively easy to track usage automatically (see Release 1.0, 89-7).andP;  Buthow much goes to the original author (and his publisher) and how much to theperson who  - or owner of the agent which  - crated the links? That of courseis for the market to determine, and it will be interesting to see how itshakes out.andM;PackagingandM;In essence, we're going back to the world of data-sharing instead oftimeshari The reason for time-sharing was that it made more sense (in an ageof large machines) to keep the machines centralized and sell their services.andO;Now there are small machines, and everyone can afford the equivalent of whatused to a large machine on his desk.andP;  But it still makes sense to keep thedata centralized, so that it can be filtered and only the results of queriesneed be sent over still-narrow wires to the  final customers.andP;  This is partlya way to monitor usage, but it also enables the data to be mashed  andgrinded centrally by huge number- and text-crunchers that even nowadays arebe too expensive to deploy locally.andP;  After the text has been categorized andlinked, then individual users will be able to follow specific typed links orqueries, and get what they want.andM;The new model is client-server architecture, where both ends of the systemare intelligent.andP;  Once the data is shaped and filtered for the customer, it'sthe job of the client workstation to make the resulting subset accessible tousers for incorporation into reports or further analysis.andP;  Client software(such as IZE, Agenda or Topic, among others) lets the user generate queries,specify filters and manipulate the text and data he downloads.andM;REUSABLE CODEandM;Reusability is a fundamental principle of object-oriented computing.andP;  It alsounderlies the notion of dynamic link libraries, modular programs andinterprocess communication found in OS/2 and UNIX (among others).andP;  Ifapplication can talk to each other, they can use each other's servicesinstead of doing everything themselves.andP;  Each developer does only the partshe can do best, and de facto reuses other people's modules for the rest.andP;  Asthese approaches become fashionable, they will lead to a large secondarymarket in class libraries and application components.andP;  What kinds of con-tracts will govern their reuse? And as they get modified and resold again andagain, who gets paid and in what proportion? In the end, who will make theinvestment to turn a module into a standard  - a public good the existence ofwhich benefits us all? We believe the market  - with its trial-and-error,risk-and-incentive mechanisms effected through the application ofintellectual property law  - is by far the most effective approach.andP;  In aworld without incentives based on some notion of intellectual property, wecan't see what forces would propel the creation of good products and ofstandards.andP;  Vendors would be unable to leverage their products, and wouldprobably instead sell professional services or black  boxes, all the whileendeavoring to keep their techniques and technology secret.andM;Perhaps this market will work through the (not yet funded nor even proposed)National Software Registry and Licensing Bureau, a huge object-orientedtransaction database, a sort of Libary of Congress-cum-stock market offunctional intellectual property.andP;  Of course, software is not as fungible asandM;stocks are, but that's why it's an interesting technical challenge.andM;(SeandM;Release 1.0, 89-6,  SQL and prices,&quot; page 19.)andM;POSTSCRIPT: SOVIET UNION AGAINandM;Our visit to the-Soviet Union recalls the story of the fish who climbed ontoland and thereby discovered what water was all about.andP;  So it may beinstructive to relate what it's like in a world without private intellectualproperty (or much of any other kind, either).andP;  People do have some incentive to create software, because the institutes and factories and offices wherethey (pretend to) work (pretend to) pay them to (pretend to) do so.andP;  But oncethat code is created, it generally languishes.andP;  No one advertises it,improves on it, or resells it.andP;  No one supports it or writes manuals aboutit.andP;  No one proclaims its benefits.andP;  There's no reason to.andP;  Meanwhile,because there's no incentive to spread information about any new inventionsin the software (an integral part of a market system), developers don't learnfrom each other.andP;  Sure, people trade programs and there's some interaction,but the free flow of free information moves slowly without market channels toflow in.andM;COMING SOONandM;Europe 1992.andM;CompuServe, Prodigy, MCI Mall, USENET, Internet, et al.andP;
