For many, Hurricane Hugo swept that struggle into view andbrought to the surface the bitter divisions of a predominantlyblack society in which whites control the land, the jobs and thefood.   From the slave revolts of the 1700s and early 1800s tomodern-day coups, revolutions, gang warfare and food riots, thehistory of the Caribbean is punctuated by civil strife.   This century, the United States occupied Haiti for 15 yearsuntil 1934, twice occupied the Dominican Republic _ in 1916 to putdown a civil war and in 1965 after the assassination of Gen. RafaelTrujillo _ and led an invasion of Grenada in 1983 to oust a Marxistjunta.   Now, the Bush administration has sent more than 1,000 militarypolice to St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands in response towidespread looting and virtual anarchy in the aftermath of Hugo.   Tourists and other witnesses gave varying versions, but itappears hundreds of people of all ages went on a four-day lootingspree after the storm battered St. Croix on Sept. 17. The NationalGuard acknowledged that some of its members took part, and severalwitnesses said police were involved. Some tourists said they hadheard gunshots and begged to be taken off the island.   By the time federal troops arrived Sept. 21, supermarket shelveswere bare and merchandise ranging from toys to jewelry had beencleaned out of the other stores so that there was hardly anythingleft to loot.   The disturbance shattered a veneer of tranquility that hadenveloped St. Croix in the years since tourists were scared away bythe killing of eight whites, including four American tourists, byfive black men at the Fountain Valley Golf Club on Sept. 6, 1972.   In the Virgin Islands, which calls itself the ``AmericanParadise,'' tourism is the No. 1 industry, with 1.5 millionvisitors a year spending more than $500 million.   Former territorial Sen. Alicia Torres James said reports ofwhite residents and shopkeepers arming themselves againstmachete-wielding gangs of blacks were wildly exaggerated.   ``I came out of my roofless house at 6 a.m. and, yes, I saw somelooting,'' she said. ``But people were taking food and things theyneeded for their houses.''   Others said the looting developed into a nonviolentfree-for-all. Adults accompanied by children were seen casuallypicking through merchandise, and many gave their names to reportersand allowed themselves to be photographed.   Some feel it was the lack of police or military authority on St.Croix after the hurricane that provoked looting on a scale that didnot occur in its sister island of St. Thomas or anywhere else inthe storm-struck region.   ``I can understand people getting food and getting supplies,''said Alex Pelovitz, 31, who owns a computer business and has livedin St. Croix for eight years. ``But I can't understand peoplegetting lawn mowers and refrigerators and VCRs. It was more of aparty than anything else.''   The disturbance was probably as much rooted in economics as inracial tension, said Pedro Rivera, an economist at the Institute ofCaribbean Studies in San Juan.   ``In a situation of survival more or less, if you're from thepoor group, that is one way of trying to survive,'' he said of thelooting. ``It was not an uprising'' of blacks against whites, hesaid.   Two-thirds of the Virgin Islands' 106,000 population is ofAfrican descent. A quarter are from Puerto Rico and other Caribbeanislands, and migrants from the States make up most of the rest.   Black resentment of wealthy white property owners and touristsis pervasive in the Caribbean, Rivera said, particularly inEnglish-speaking former British colonies such as Jamaica, whereblack nationalism played an important part in independencemovements.   ``It doesn't manifest itself in terms of any overt act, but interms of the way the tourist is seen and the way he is treated,''he said. ``It's sort of like a person serving the master butresenting it inside.''   Penny Feuerzeig, executive editor of the Virgin Islands DailyNews on St. Thomas, said race relations have improved in recentyears, but there is still resentment among native Virgin Islandersagainst the better-off whites who freely move in from the UnitedStates and buy up prime property and businesses.   In particular, she said, unemployed blacks are offended by youngcollege-educated whites who come to the Virgin Islands on a larkand get a job ``three days after they arrive at the airport.''   ``It creates social strains with racial overtones,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
