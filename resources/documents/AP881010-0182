Col. Carrel Occil, military commander of the northern coastaltown, issued the order on Saturday in response to plans forupcoming demonstrations, the radio said.   Neighboorhood citizens' committees had been planningdemonstrations against unpopular government officials and insupport of the Sept. 17 coup that initiated a nationwide movementof reform, it said.   Since the ouster of the military government of Lt. Gen. HenriNamphy by rank-and-file soldiers of the Presidential Guard on Sept.17, dozens of commanders with ties to the Duvalier regime wereremoved throughout Haiti and unpopular and repressive army officersand government officials dismissed.   An unidentified member of a Cap-Haitien neighborhood committeetold Haiti-Inter that ``nothing has changed,'' that anti-democraticofficials are still holding office.   In recent declarations, such prominent political leaders asLouis Dejoie Jr. and Sylvio Claude have been calling on thegovernment to make a clean sweep of members of the dreaded TontonMacoutes from public office.   In a related development, club-swinging soldiers broke up ademonstration Sunday against the rural police in Petite Riviere, atown in the Artibonite Province 40 miles north of Port-au-Prince,Haiti-Inter reported.   The soldiers, from the garrison of Gonaives to the north of thetown, arrested two protesters and dispersed the crowd by shootinginto the air. None of the people who were clubbed was seriouslyinjured, Haiti-Inter reported.   Last week in the same town, 2,000 people demonstrated withoutincident.   In recent days, however, the army has intervened to quellrallies.   Last Wednesday, soldiers shot and killed a protester in ademonstration of squatters in the capital, and two weekends ago, inCote-de-Fer, a small southern coastal town, a popular tribunalcomposed of citizens and local soldiers was disbanded withoutincident by the army.   Dictator Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier ruled Haiti since 1957and was succeeded by his son, Jean-Claude, who fled into exile inFebruary 1986 in the midst of a popular uprising.   Namphy led a three-man junta that governed this Caribbean islandnation until Leslie Manigat was elected president last January inelections widely viewed as fraudulent.   Namphy ousted Manigat and declared himself president on June 20.</TEXT></DOC>
