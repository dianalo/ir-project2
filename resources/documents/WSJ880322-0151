Winter (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> TRW </CO><IN> TNM </IN><DATELINE> CLEVELAND  </DATELINE><TEXT>   TRW Inc. said it agreed to buy a financial services unit of Borg Warner Corp. for about $360 million, in a move that will broaden TRW's already large information systems business.    The unit, Dallas-based Chilton Corp., operates consumer credit reporting services, handles collections and assists financial institutions in targeting customers for direct-mail marketing.    &quot;The acquisition is a significant step in our previously announced strategy to invest and grow in the high-growth commercial information systems business,&quot; said Ruben F. Mettler, chairman and chief executive officer of TRW, an electronics, space, defense and automotive parts company.    The price appears steep for a unit with annual revenue of about $125 million. However, Richard D.C. Whilden, TRW executive vice president and Information Systems Group general manager, said Chilton strengthens TRW's consumer credit reporting operation and adds new services that TRW can expand rapidly.    TRW's Information Systems Group had revenue last year of more than $520 million, he said. TRW's total revenue was $6.82 billion.    TRW already has a large consumer credit information data base, but its strength is on the East and West Coasts, while Chilton is strongest in the Midwest and Texas, Mr. Whilden said. The data base provides the information for other financial services, he said.    Also, Chilton is involved in collection of past-due accounts, a service that TRW hasn't previously offered, but wants to provide, he said. Chilton also has some new services in development that appear promising, he added.    Borg-Warner, a Chicago-based space, defense, automotive and information systems concern, bought Chilton in 1986 for $252 million, and planned to pump in capital to build the business. However, since a leveraged buy-out last July, Borg-Warner has been seeking to raise capital through asset sales rather than looking for places to invest, a spokeswoman said.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, TRW shares closed at $52.25, down 75 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
