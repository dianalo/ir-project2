The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries saysit will press ahead with efforts to establish closer ties withother oil producers. But the going is likely to be slow.   OPEC wants to persuade as many independent producers as possibleto join the cartel in restraining production as a means of gettingprices up to OPEC's official target of $18 a barrel.   Hisham Nazer, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, said on Mondayin Vienna there was ``unanimous recognition in OPEC'' that OPECalone cannot keep supplies low enough to prevent prices fromlagging.   Last week a group of six independent producers, led by Mexico,met with a committee of six OPEC oil ministers and presented anoffer: we'll cut our oil exports by 5 percent if you do likewise.   The two groups issued a joint communique declaring ``thebeginning of a new stage of cooperation'' among some of the biggestoil-producing countries in the world. But that's as far as it went.   The non-OPEC officials left town and all 13 of the OPECministers spent four days debating the offer, only to suspend thetalks after falling into a bitter impasse.   Cartel leaders said they were not explicitly rejecting thenon-OPEC offer, they just wanted more time to think it over.   The offer, by Mexico, Egypt, China, Oman, Malaysia and Oman, wasfor two months of production cuts only, starting May 1.   Now that the starting date has passed and the OPEC leaders havegone home, there is little chance the two groups will get back toconsidering joint production cuts before next year. That's becauseoil demand is expected to rise in the second half of this year,eliminating the incentive on both sides to grapple with the problemof sharing any cutbacks.   This is likely to be welcomed in Washington. Energy SecretaryJohn Herrington has publicly campaigned against what he calledefforts to create a ``world OPEC.''   Even so, OPEC says it will try to keep alive a dialogue withnon-OPEC exporters, including the Soviet Union, which ranks as theworld's largest oil producer. The United States is the No. 2producer.   ``It is important that we keep talking to them,'' RilwanuLukman, the OPEC president, said of the six independent exporterswho met in Vienna. ``The opportunity given to us is one that wecannot take lightly.''   The reasons are obvious. OPEC's capacity for influencing oilprices has been gradually eroded by the emergence of new oilproducers in all corners of the globe.   Ironically, it was the sudden and severe increases in OPEC oilprices in the 1970s that created the financial incentive forcountries to step up the search for oil. In recent years Norway,China, Angola, Colombia and many other nations have joined theranks of oil exporters.   As production outside its control steadily rose, OPECreluctantly chose to cut its output in a vain attempt to preventprices from falling.   Today the cartel pumps about 17.5 million barrels a day,compared with a peak in 1978 of 31 million barrels daily. In thatsame period, non-OPEC output has jumped from about 22 millionbarrels daily to more than 28 million.   This year alone, non-OPEC oil output is expected to rise by800,000 barrels a day. OPEC's probably will not grow at all.   All oil exporters naturally want to get as much for theirproduct as possible. But they seem to have little prospect forovercoming the political and economic differences that make formalcooperation with OPEC hard to achieve.   ``There just isn't a community of interest between them,'' saidPaul McDonald, a London-based oil consultant. ``You're either amember of OPEC or not; nobody's knocking down the door to joinOPEC.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR`S NOTE _ Robert Burns has covered OPEC for The AssociatedPress since 1982.</TEXT></DOC>
