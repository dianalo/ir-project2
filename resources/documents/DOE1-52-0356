After making a concisereview of preceding research on the detection problem, including themost recent results of such work summarized at international conferences,a method is proposed for detecting anthropogenic warming which is basedon an analysis of the most reliable empirical data and insofar as possiblefree of invoking hypotheses which have not been clearly demonstrated.Since even the best models of the theory of climate are essentially dependenton the parameterizations used in the models, it was deemed desirablethat the results be compared with evaluations made using other methods,such as evaluation of the sensitivity of climate to the carbon dioxideconcentration in the atmosphere on the basis of paleoclimatic data, specifically,data on the mean CO{sub 2} concentration in the Tertiary and Cretaceous.After carefully evaluating the influence of thermal inertia of the climaticsystem, a simplified model is proposed which is suitable for describingthe mean annual exchange of heat and various tracers between the oceanand the atmosphere. The period considered was 1881-1984. The reliabilityof the observed global warming exceeds 99%. It appears to be an inescapablefact that the warming of global climate which is occurring is attributableto anthropogenic factors. 36 references, 3 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
