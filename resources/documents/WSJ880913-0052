A senior Jordanian air force official said the agreement was formalized during a meeting between British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Jordan's King Hussein, who has been visiting Britain for several days.    The official, who requested anonymity, refused to say what the sale's value was or how many of the planes were involved. Petra also didn't give details. But according to British officials, Jordan is seeking eight or nine of the jets, designed by a European consortium and built by British Aerospace PLC.    A sale of Tornado fighter jets to Jordan would further a trend in which European countries are replacing the U.S. as arms suppliers to the Middle East. In July, Britain sold about $10 billion worth of military equipment to Saudi Arabia, including Tornados and minesweeper ships. Meanwhile, the French are said to be talking with the Jordanian government about the possible sale of Mirage fighter planes.    European arms makers have stepped into the breach after proposed U.S. sales have been stymied by a Congress that's increasingly reluctant to arm countries hostile to Israel.    The fact that Jordan has looked to Europe comes as a relief to some U.S. officials who had worried that the kingdom would approach the Soviet Union. However, as Europe edges closer to Jordan, the U.S. loses its leverage in engaging that nation in the Israeli-Arab peace process. From Israel's standpoint, the countries they most distrust are obtaining the weaponry they want; it just comes from different sources. </TEXT></DOC>
