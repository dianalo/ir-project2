The ruling prompted warnings of possible U.S. retaliation. Clayton Yeutter, U.S. trade representative, said in Washington that the Canadian decision was &quot;totally unjustified&quot; and that the U.S. would consider an &quot;appropriate response.&quot; He argued that the level of U.S. corn exports to Canada has been too small to hurt Canadian corn producers.    Harold Cutler, president of the U.S. National Corn Growers Association, said in Greenville, N.C., that the Canadian ruling is &quot;a horrendous precedent.&quot;    The countervailing duty is to offset subsidies that U.S. corn growers were found to be receiving under various U.S. government programs. The duty equals 55% of the current Chicago price of $1.555 (U.S.) a bushel for corn for March delivery.    Mr. Cutler said U.S. corn growers are worried that other countries will copy the Canadian move. He said French corn growers, inspired by the Canadian action, have already filed with a Common Market agency a petition for a countervailing duty on imports of U.S. corn gluten feed.    The Canadian action was initiated last spring by the Ontario Corn Producers Association, a farmers' organization. It claimed the survival of Ontario corn growers was threatened by the U.S. farm law enacted in December 1985. The bill has depressed grain prices and provided substantial assistance to U.S. growers.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said in Washington that Canadian imports of U.S. corn, which have been declining in recent years, &quot;aren't the cause of any problem that Canadian corn producers may have.&quot; He suggested that the Canadian difficulties stemmed from excess Canadian production. Canada's corn output totaled 7.4 million metric tons in the year ended July 31, an 11% increase from five years earlier. During the same period, Canadian imports of U.S. corn dropped 64% to 300,000 tons.    The Canadian Import Tribunal, a government agency, said imports of subsidized U.S. corn have caused &quot;material injury&quot; to Canadian producers. The federal revenue department, after a lengthy inquiry, ruled last month that U.S. corn growers were being subsidized, but imposition of a permanent countervailing duty depended on an injury determination by the tribunal. The tribunal said it will issue the reasons for its finding within 15 days.    Mr. Lyng said the Canadian ruling &quot;isn't helpful in the context&quot; of the current U.S.-Canadian negotiations for an agreement to remove trade barriers between the two countries. The U.S. National Corn Growers Association said the Canadian action raises doubts about their &quot;good faith&quot; in the free-trade negotiations.    The tribunal's ruling exempts from countervailing duty U.S. corn shipped to British Columbia. The exemption had been sought by the British Columbia livestock industry. </TEXT></DOC>
