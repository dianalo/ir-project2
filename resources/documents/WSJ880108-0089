The FCC, under a 13-year-old rule designed to break up media monopolies, prohibits a company from owning a newspaper and either a television or radio station in the same city. As a result, Mr. Murdoch must soon decide whether to sell either the New York Post or WNYW-TV in New York, and either the Boston Herald or WFXT-TV in Boston.    But the personality battle between the conservative publisher and liberal politicians who have pushed him to this point has obscured the question of whether the FCC policy makes sense or not. The policy has forced about two dozen media companies to unload newspapers or broadcast properties.    That's all to the good, argues Henry Geller, a former FCC general counsel, because as a result of the regulation those companies can't control news and information in a city or dominate local advertisers. &quot;People get news from television and newspapers,&quot; he says. &quot;They should be in separate hands.&quot;    A host of critics say, however, that the rule has become an anachronism. They contend that the rapid growth of cable-television systems, independent TV stations, satellite TV receivers and electronic information services limits the ability of any single company to dominate the news. &quot;We're so information-rich, it boggles the mind that in almost any market there could be a problem with a newspaper owning a television station,&quot; says former FCC Chairman Mark Fowler.    Craig Smith, president of the Freedom of Expression Foundation, a newspaper-funded research group in Washington, even argues that the cross-ownership ban has helped kill some of the 111 newspapers that have folded since 1975. By forbidding newspapers to buy lucrative local TV stations that can subsidize newspaper operations, he says, &quot;we're losing our diversity of independent newspapers.&quot;    The cross-ownership rules have been shrouded in controversy from the start. Other FCC rules ban broadcasters from owning more than one television station in a market, and forbid TV stations from owning local AM or FM radio stations or local cable-television systems.    The cross-ownership rule has two goals in mind: First to protect the public from a single company controlling information and blocking the discussion of controversial material, and second to protect competitors from one company cornering the market for local advertising.    Everette Dennis, executive director of the Gannett Center for Media Studies in New York, says that if the rule is repealed, media companies would begin swapping newspapers and TV stations in order to assemble local media monopolies. &quot;In most markets, there's only one newspaper and one or two dominant television stations,&quot; he says. &quot;The result could be unfair competition.&quot;    Under Mr. Fowler, and his successor Dennis Patrick, the FCC has begun to loosen the rules, arguing that the vast growth in media outlets protects the public against media barons who would dominate public debate. The agency also believes that the rules have unnecessarily harmed weaker media, such as AM radio, which might benefit from merging with profitable TV stations. The agency has discretion to change the rules, unless directed otherwise by Congress.    The newspaper rule has hit some powerful media companies since 1975. The Washington Post, fearing that the Nixon-appointed FCC would force it to sell its local TV station as retribution for its Watergate coverage, swapped the Washington station for one in Detroit. But the Post probably miscalculated -- the FCC required divestiture only in 16 small cities where it felt media monopolies could be most coercive. Big-city media companies that owned newspapers and broadcast stations in the same market before the rule came into effect were permitted to keep both.    New buyers, however, have had to choose between newspapers and broadcast stations. In the late 1970s, the FCC turned down a request by Joe Allbritton to own both the Washington Star and WJLA-TV in Washington. Instead, he sold the Star to Time Inc., which later closed the unprofitable newspaper. Since that time, the rule has forced Capital Cities/ABC Inc. to sell two newspapers in suburban New Jersey and Gannett Co., which bought the Detroit News, to sell two radio stations in Detroit. It also required Mr. Murdoch to sell the Chicago Sun-Times after he acquired a Chicago television station.    Jerald Fritz, vice president of legal affairs for Allbritton Communications Co., blames the failure of the Washington Star on the cross-ownership rule. &quot;Allbritton needed the cash-flow of WJLA to keep the Star afloat,&quot; he says.    Mr. Murdoch warns the same fate could await the New York Post. &quot;If I can't sell it, I'll have to close it,&quot; he said in an interview Wednesday on Cable News Network. He also said he'd keep the Herald and sell the Boston TV station if forced to.    In a several-inch-thick FCC filing, Mr. Murdoch's News America Corp. sloughs off concerns that it could dominate either the New York or Boston market through cross-ownership.    In New York, News America says, its New York Post-WNYW-TV combination controls only 8.7% of local advertising revenue and faces competition from big media companies that, through grandfather exemptions, also own broadcast properties. New York Times Co., for instance, owns the New York Times and WQXR AM and FM; Tribune Co. owns the New York Daily News and WPIX-TV and WPIX-FM.    News America makes a similar case for its Boston operations, which it insists it maintains separately. But Stuart Tauber, assistant general manager for independent station WSBK-TV, claims that his station is hurt by the cross-ownership because Mr. Murdoch's Boston Herald plays up programs on the Murdoch television station, WFXT. &quot;Murdoch gets a promotional advantage by having a house organ,&quot; Mr. Tauber contends. </TEXT></DOC>
