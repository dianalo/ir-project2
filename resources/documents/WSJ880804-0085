But problems could force another postponement.    The engine firing is the most difficult test facing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration before launching Discovery sometime in September or October because it involves firing the actual spacecraft rather than test equipment. But preparations for the test have become embarrassing for NASA, which has repeatedly discovered tiny fuel-line leaks, played down their significance and then delayed the test while scrambling to repair the leaks.    This space-agency soap opera has raised anew questions of whether NASA has become too cautious for its own good, and ought to press on with the launch.    Robert Sieck, the launch director at Kennedy Space Center here, where the test firing will take place, said he is confident that the agency has licked the leak problems. &quot;I think the hardware will be good to us,&quot; he said. But doubts remain. Workers at Kennedy spent all night Tuesday hunting for the cause of a small hydrogen fuel-line leak, but couldn't find it. Instead, they installed new seals and filters, which they figure will take care of the problem.    But Mr. Sieck said if the line unexpectedly started leaking again while fueling Discovery, NASA might have to postpone the test once again, even though he said the leak wouldn't cause an explosion. He added that NASA planned to set off tiny explosions -- like &quot;Roman candles&quot; -- on the launch pad to burn off stray hydrogen and reduce the chance of a large explosion even further.    In addition, Mr. Sieck said, NASA would cancel the test if it rained, on the off chance that the firing could be hit by lightning.    During the test, NASA will fire Discovery's three main engines for 20 seconds. These fireworks will rivet attention, but the test will largely evaluate how well the shuttle's unseen software works. Shuttle software ties together individual flight equipment, which NASA already has tested, and orchestrates their complex workings.    During the test firing, for instance, the software must ignite the shuttle engines one after the other, in a sequence that takes about one-third of a second to complete, and shut them off in precise order 20 seconds later. Equally as important, the shuttle software must make sure the two giant solid-rocket boosters, which give the shuttle most of its power during liftoff, don't ignite during the test. Once lit, the solid-rocket boosters burn until they exhaust their fuel or explode.    Even if the test succeeds, NASA faces a host of technical hurdles before launch. Kennedy workers soon will start trying to repair yet another leak buried deep in the orbiter -- the first time NASA has ever cut into the orbiter while it sits on the launch pad.    Later this month, the agency also is expected to test a solid-rocket booster with holes bored into it to see how well the booster's back-up seals contain escaping gases. A faulty rocket seal led to the Challenger disaster on Jan. 28, 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
