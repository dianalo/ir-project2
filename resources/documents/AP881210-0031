The IRS is looking at the records to determine if there wasmisuse of tax-exempt contributions, Ellen Murphy, IRS director ofpublic affairs, said Friday.   Ms. Murphy did not identify those being investigated, saying thelaw prohibits such disclosure.   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that the Rev.Jerry Falwell had been notified that the IRS will begin a reviewnext month of Falwell's Liberty University and may later look intohis television show, the Old Time Gospel Hour.   The Post also reported that spokeswomen for evangelists PatRobertson and Oral Roberts had confirmed the IRS was auditing theiroperations. Both organizations said they had not received word onresults of the investigations.   The Post said the IRS is looking into whether Robertson usedmillions of dollars from his Christian Broadcasting Network to helpfinance his bid for the presidency. That probe reportedly iscompleted, but CBN spokesman Frankie Abourjilie said another inquirywas under way into the operation of the tax-exempt CBN network, thePost said.   Former PTL host Jim Bakker, who was indicted this week on wireand mail fraud charges, is part of the IRS investigation, accordingto sources quoted by the Post.   Ms. Murphy said the IRS routinely examines records of tax-exemptorganizations. The investigations into various television evangelistministries are in various stages and do not reflect any decision totake a major look at evangelists, she said.   Assistant IRS Commissioner Robert I. Brauer wrote to Rep. J.J.Pickle, D-Texas, chairman of a Ways and Means oversightsubcommittee, that at least six probes involved televisionevangelists and two were criminal investigations, Ms. Murphy said.   The letter said the IRS was examining whether contributions tothe ministries were diverted for personal use but were not reportedas income, whether salaries and benefits received by evangelistswere higher than that considered reasonable for tax-exemptorganizations, and whether donations were illegally channeled intopolitical activities, the Post said.   Ms. Murphy said such investigations could lead to criminalcharges or to an IRS bid to revoke an organization's tax-exemptstatus. However, she also said the IRS generally tries to get anorganization to make internal changes to allow it to keep itstax-exempt status, and such a move might not be made public.   A Falwell spokesman said his organizations had been audited twicebefore and the IRS ``found our books to be in good shape.'' Falwellwelcomed the audit, the Post quoted the spokesman as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
