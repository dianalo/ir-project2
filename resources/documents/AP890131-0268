Approval of the repurchase followed a British government orderearlier this month that the Kuwait Investment Office, theLondon-based investment arm of the Kuwaiti government, reduce its21.68 percent ownership in the petroleum company to 9.9 percent.   An unexpectedly large turnout at the special meeting and thenumber of proxy votes cast ``show small shareholders have had aninterest in what we've been doing and approve,'' BP Chairman PeterWalters said after the vote.   Kuwait had been ordered by the British government to dispose ofits BP interest above 9.9 percent within three years, but BP saidthe buyback would remove the element of uncertainty over the pendingdisposal and ultimately aid the performance of the company's shares.   The British government's order to the Kuwaitis came after aruling in October by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that thebig Kuwaiti holding could ``operate against the public interest''because of Kuwait's membership in the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries.   The Kuwait Investment Office built up its holding by buyingpartly paid BP stock in the months following the government's 7.2billion pound, or $13.2 billion, public offering of BP shares inOctober 1987.   The sale by the Conservative government under its policy ofprivatization coincided with the stock market crash. The offering,which included the government's remaining 31.5 percent stake in BP,was seriously undersubscribed.   Although the price BP will pay the Kuwaitis amounts to 305 pencefor each of the 790 million shares owned by Kuwait, BP willeffectively pay 247 pence a share because of tax credits.   Walters said the repurchase would be completed by mid-March.</TEXT></DOC>
