BC's management systemsand the controls exercised on the selection of capital expenditure werefound to be generally good. The business planning system, the cost perGJ criteria used to eliminate high cost projects and the discounted cashflow (DCF) investment appraisal methods applied, all help to ensure thatcapital expenditure contributes to BC's strategy of cost reduction. Neverthelessthere is room for improvement and the report identifies priority areasfor attention.</TEXT></DOC>
