Until a test is developed that can identify the onemillion or more women who have the A-T gene, as it is known,it would be prudent for physicians to minimize the use ofdiagnostic tests that expose the female breast to X-rays, thescientists cautioned. They urged physicians to use ultrasoundor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnostic tests insteadof X-rays whenever possible.</LP><TEXT>   The researchers estimated that of the 176,000 women whodevelop breast cancer each year, between 7% and 14% may becarrying the A-T gene.   The new finding is likely to heighten the debate overwhether women younger than 50 years of age should undergoperiodic mammographic examinations that involve exposing thebreast to weak or &quot;soft&quot; X-rays. Since breast cancer is lesscommon among younger women, various medical groups haveargued heatedly whether the mammography uncovers enoughcurable breast cancers to outweigh the possibility that theX-rays might induce some new breast cancers.   The new finding, however, isn't likely to changeprevailing medical opinion that periodic mammography forwomen over 50 years of age pays off. Repeated studies of thisage group, where breast cancer is most common, show thatperiodic mammograms detect enough breast cancers at a curablestage to extend the average life expectancy of older women.   However, &quot;We would like to see all older mammographymachines that give higher doses of radiation retiredimmediately&quot; in favor of newer, low-dose machines, saidmedical geneticist Michael Swift who headed the University ofNorth Carolina-Chapel Hill team that reported the new findingin this week's New England Journal of Medicine.   The A-T gene is so named because people who are unluckyenough to inherit two copies of the gene, one from eachparent, develop a rare disease called ataxia-telangiectasia.The disease affects the immune system but involves suchsymptoms as stumbling and uncoordinated movements (ataxia)and red splotches on the skin (telangiectasia).   A-T patients also are 61 to 184 times more likely todevelop cancer than those in the general population. In lightof this fact, the North Carolina researchers launched aneffort to see if having a single copy of the gene alsoboosted the risk of developing cancer, as some previousstudies had hinted.   In 1982 the researchers began following the lives anddeaths of 1,599 adult blood relatives of 161 families inwhich at least one person had been born withataxia-telangiectasia. The prevalence of people carrying asingle copy of the A-T gene would be far higher among bloodrelatives of such patients than among the general population.   Among these blood relatives, it was fairly certain that294 possessed one copy of the A-T gene because of theirgeneological relationship with an A-T patient. It waspresumed that other blood relatives probably possessed onecopy of the gene but their position in the family treecouldn't distinguish them.   The researchers found that within five years 18 newcancers developed among those known to have one copy of theA-T gene. Statisticians calculated that possessing a singlecopy of the gene boosted the risk of cancer by 3.8-fold formen and 3.5-fold for women over the risk of the generalpopulation.   Of the 18 cancers, the most common was breast cancer, ofwhich there were five cases. This indicated that the singleA-T gene boosted the risk of breast cancer by fivefold.   Not all the women who carried a single copy of the A-Tgene developed breast cancer, or any cancer, the researchersnoted. This indicated that while the gene may render thewomen susceptible to cancer some environmental agent has tostrike to actually cause the cancer.   To find the environmental trigger of breast cancer, theresearchers looked into the medical backgrounds of 19 femaleblood relatives who had developed breast cancer. Ten of them,or more than half, had had chest or abdominal exposures toX-rays for either medical or occupational reasons. Incontrast, only 19% of a group of &quot;control&quot; women of similarage and background, who were being monitored simultaneously,had been exposed to such X-rays.   The data &quot;are consistent with a fivefold to sixfold excessrisk of breast cancer among blood relatives&quot; of A-T patientswho have had single or multiple X-ray examinations of thechest or abdomen, Dr. Swift and his colleagues concluded.   They noted that 1.4% of the population may unwittinglyharbor a single copy of the A-T gene but that a test todetect it isn't yet available. &quot;Until that is possible it maybe prudent to take into account the 1% chance that anyone&quot;can possess a single A-T gene &quot;and to take the most stringentmeasures possible to minimize incidental diagnostic X-rayexposure of the female breast,&quot; they said.</TEXT></DOC>
