Mobil, of Fairfax, Va., also said it trimmed its 1992capital appropriations budget by 17% to $4.8 billion from itsforecast a year ago. Much of the reduction will be in Mobil'sdomestic development of reserves, especially in natural gas.</LP><TEXT>   The charges include $75 million for employee reductionsand $30 million for drilling an unproductive well in Peru.   The nation's third-largest oil company blamed the job cutson crude-oil prices &quot;$2 to $3 {a barrel} below last year'slevel.&quot; A spokesman said the sag is expected to continue&quot;depending on Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesproduction and product demand.&quot;   Analysts said the first-quarter charge may chop about fivecents from their earnings forecasts of 75 cents a share forMobil in the first quarter. In the year-earlier quarter,Mobil had net income of $710 million, or $1.73 a share, onrevenue of $16.58 billion.   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Mobil sharesclosed at $60.125, down 12.5 cents.   &quot;If they can cut 1,000 jobs for $75 million, that'scheap,&quot; said Simon Trimble, an analyst at Shearson LehmanBrothers. &quot;Restructuring now means improved earnings later.&quot;   Mobil has 67,500 employees world-wide. At the end of 1990,the latest period for which figures are available, domesticemployment was 59% of its total.   Mobil previously took charges of $40 million in 1989 and$42 million in 1991 for employee reductions. The 1,000reductions this year represent about 20% of Mobil's employeesin U.S. exploration and production, the company said.   The company's domestic costs for finding oil are higherthan for foreign operations. According to a recent report byArthur Andersen andamp; Co., Mobil's finding costs per barrel ofdomestic oil were $4.38 in the five years ending in 1989, themost recent figures available. Mobil's world-wide findingcosts, on the other hand, were $4 during the same period.   The company's domestic costs for finding oil are higherthan for foreign operations. According to a recent report byArthur Andersen andamp; Co., Mobil's finding costs per barrel ofdomestic oil were $4.38 in the four years ending in 1989, themost recent figures available. Mobil's world-wide findingcosts, on the other hand, were $4 during the same period.   &quot;The U.S. side of the business is going through a majorrestructuring. The lack of potential opportunity to drill andthe high cost of replacement is shifting the emphasis tooverseas all over the industry,&quot; said Shearson Lehman's Mr.Trimble.   Mobil also blamed the job reductions on continued low U.S.natural gas prices. Low demand due to warmer-than-normalweather in the Northeast, high inventories, federal subsidieson certain gas in new fields that allow some producers tosell at below-market prices, and increased imports fromCanada have combined to reduce prices to 12-year lows at thewellhead this winter.   The company said the dry hole in Peru that resulted in the$30 million charge is in the Upper Huallaga Valley. &quot;This isthe first well drilled in the nine-million-acre Huallagaexploration area. While we are very disappointed with theresults of this well, continued seismic operations willfurther evaluate the potential of the area,&quot; Mobil said.</TEXT></DOC>
