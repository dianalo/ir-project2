ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The jury in Oliver North's Iran-Contra trialwas dispatched Thursday to decide the guilt or innocence of theformer White House aide with the judge's admonition that no one,including the president, had ``the legal authority to order anyoneto violate the law.''   North has said he had authority from superiors including, hebelieved, President Reagan, for many of his actions in behalf ofthe Nicaraguan rebels at a time when official U.S. aid was banned.   Because of the lateness of the hour, jurors were sent to thenearby hotel where they will be sequestered, with orders to begindeliberations on Friday.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell told them ``your job is todecide the facts'' in the first trial stemming from the mid-1980saffair in which profits from arms sales to Iran were diverted toaid the Nicaraguan rebels.   The judge was specific in his instruction about North'scontention that he acted under orders from top White Houseofficials and, he assumed, with Reagan's approval.   ``Neither the president nor any of the defendant's superiors hadthe legal authority to order anyone to violate the law,'' Gesellsaid.   ``You have heard testimony indicating that other governmentofficials may in some respects have concealed facts known to them,and some ranking above or below the defendant may have engaged inconduct similar to that charged against the defendant on trial.''   But, he said, the conduct of others was no justification and``you are not to judge defendant's guilt or innocence based solelyon the actions of others.''   The judge's charge was delayed for a half day by a probleminvolving jurors who may have given misleading answers in pre-trialquestioning. When he convened court in the afternoon, Gesell saidhe had denied a North motion for a mistrial, filed on grounds that``the jury had been infected by publicity about some of itsmembers.''   The five alternates were dismissed after Gesell gave theinstructions.   Gesell said North's defense that he was authorized to cover uphis secret Contra role may be considered, but under closely definedcircumstances.   ``Authorization requires clear, direct instruction to act at agiven time in a given way,'' he said. ``It must be specific, notsimply a general admonition or vague expression of preference. Itmust be sufficiently precise.''   The most attentive person in the courtroom as Gesell read hislong instructions appeared to be North, whose eyes seldom left thejudge. Occasionally, the 47 year-old defendant would make a note ona legal pad, writing with his left hand.   North's wife and mother had been in the courtroom for much ofthe morning's long wait, but they did not return in the afternoonuntil the instructions had been read.   Six of the charges involve withholding information from Congresswhen it sought to find out about North's and the National SecurityCouncil's role in supplying aid to the Contras.   Conviction on each of those counts carries a maximum penalty offive years in prison. Each of the 12 counts has a $250,000 penalty,for a maximum of $3 million.   North also is charged with obstructing a presidential inquiry,making false statements when he was questioned by Attorney GeneralEdwin Meese III, and conspiring to defraud the United Statesthrough illegal use of a tax-exempt foundation. Each of thosecounts carries a 5-year penalty.   One count of altering, destroying and concealing documents ispunishable by three years in prison; another, of accepting anillegal gratuity _ a $13,800 security system _ is punishable by twoyears. The remaining count, converting traveler's checks to hispersonal use carries a 10-year maximum sentence.   If convicted of all counts, North could be sentenced to amaximum of 60 years in prison, but federal court practice is tolimit sentences to the longest on a single count _ in this case 10years. Jurors also have the option of convicting North of aidingand abetting in a crime rather than as the principal in seven ofthe charges. The penalty would be the same as for conviction of thefull charge.   Gesell had scheduled final instructions to the jury in themorning, but instead remained in his chambers, apparentlyrequestioning some or all of the jurors and alternates.   ABC News had reported that jurors Caswell G. Hartridge, 61, andHelen G. Lynch, 37, had been named as defendants in civil suitsinvolving accidents in 1982.   Both answered ``no'' on jury questionnaires asking whether theyhad ``ever been involved as a party ... in any court proceedings(civil or criminal).'' Both cases were settled out of court.   ABC also reported that the first alternate juror, Joseph L.Ward, 33, who answered ``no'' to the same question, had beenarrested in 1974 on a charge of sale and possession of narcotics.He was placed on probation for a year, the network said. He alsowas arrested in 1987 on a marijuana possession charge but wasn'tprosecuted, it said.   In the jury room will be hundreds of pages of exhibitsintroduced in the course of the trial, including a 42-page``admission'' by the government of actions taken in behalf of theContras.   The document summarizes events the government considered sosecret that it wanted no testimony about them in open court. Amongthem is mention of a 1985 trip in which George Bush, thenvice-president, told the president of Honduras that nation wouldreceive expedited military and economic aid.   That aid, according to other testimony, was part of anarrangement for Honduras' allowing supplies to reach the Contras,although there was no mention that Bush knew of the deal.   Bush said Thursday that ``my conscience is clear'' about theIran-Contra affair, and he promised to cooperate with congressionalrequests for unreleased Reagan administration documents.   As before, he refused to comment directly on his role in theaffair.   In final arguments to the jury Wednesday, defense lawyer BrendanSullivan declared that the government ``has not shown criminalbehavior'' by North. He concluded: ``I ask you to set him free.''   But prosecutor John Keker said that even though North openlyadmits lying to Congress and shredding evidence he has refused toacknowledge that he did anything wrong. ``It's time for you to doit for him,'' Keker told the jurors.</TEXT></DOC>
