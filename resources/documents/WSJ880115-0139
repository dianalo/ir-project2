A total of 21,300 interest rate options were traded, according to figures from the clearing house of the Marche a Terme des Instruments Financiers (Matif). That compares with predictions that turnover of 5,000 to 10,000 contracts would be reasonable for the first session, and with daily volume of 36,255 contracts for the more established Matif futures that serve as a basis for the options.    First-day volume was all the more surprising because it came when the rest of the French capital markets were lethargic. Other &quot;markets were calm because people were waiting for the U.S. trade figures (due Friday), so it wouldn't have been a surprise to see relatively light volume&quot; in options, according to Christian Picot, an assistant director at Banque Financiere Parisienne.    Some traders said the unexpectedly high volume for options was partly caused by the calm conditions in other markets. &quot;It meant that the underlying futures instrument didn't move very much, which allowed options traders to get used to things,&quot; one trader commented. </TEXT></DOC>
