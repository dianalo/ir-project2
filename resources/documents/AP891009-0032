The Soviets no longer need so many tanks because their latestmodels are superior in some cases to those of the West in armor,mobility and firepower said Christopher F. Foss, editor of the1989-1990 edition of the respected ``Jane's Armor and Artillery.''   Foss wrote in his foreword to the volume describing the world'sarmored vehicles and towed guns that the past year was dominated bythe Soviet decision to withdraw some of its conventional forcesfrom Eastern Europe without waiting for similar concessions fromNATO.   He said that what many observers failed to realize was that thequality of Soviet tanks had become superior.   ``The introduction of the T-64, T-72 and T-80 main battle tanksgave the Soviet Union a quantum leap in that they introduced newtanks with significant improvements in armor, mobility andfirepower over their earlier T-54, T-55 and T-62 tanks,'' Foss said.   No NATO main battle tank has automatic gun-loading, which allthree new Soviet tanks have, enabling them to carry as few as threecrewmen, the editor said.   Fire control systems for armored fighting vehicles throughoutthe Warsaw Pact have also been improved with a laser rangefinderreplacing optical systems to give gunners a greater chance ofhitting a target on the first shot, he said.   New armor on Soviet tanks ``has made the vehicles virtuallyimmune'' to penetration by shells from any NATO tank, Foss said.   ``The Soviet tank fleet consists of well over 50,000 vehicles ofsome five basic types excluding heavy tanks and World War IIvehicles still held in reserve,'' the editor said.</TEXT></DOC>
