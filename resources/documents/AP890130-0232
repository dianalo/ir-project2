The minister's pledge was made in a statement to his country'sArabic-language daily Oman and broadcast by Muscat Radio, monitoredin Bahrain.   Meanwhile, Syria said it plans to boost its oil exports from80,000 barrels a day in 1988 to around 130,000 to 140,000 barrels aday this year.   Oman's announcement followed a meeting last week in Londonbetween oil experts from six OPEC countries and 13 non-OPECcountries.   ``Oman is ready to reduce its exports within the framework of ageneral agreement for oil producers outside OPEC,'' Shanfari wasquoted as saying. He did not give any percentage.   A statement issued after last Thursday's meeting called fornon-OPEC oil producing nations to cooperate with the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries in stabilizing world oil prices.   The statement also urged non-OPEC producers to continue this``initial effort'' in the second half of the year.   OPEC agreed last November, after oil prices slumped to near 1986levels, to cut production to 18.5 million barrels a day and helpreturn Middle East crude prices to an $18 target from below $12. Thenew quota was to take effect Jan. 1.   Although prices have risen more than $3 a barrel since theagreement, various reports suggest that OPEC production is stillhigher than the 18.5 million barrel mark.   OPEC has said it cannot stabilize prices alone and has called forthe cooperation of non-OPEC producers. Last week's meeting cappedOPEC's latest effort to garner support from producers outside thecartel.   Shanfari stressed that a unilateral adherence to such a requestwould be pointless as it would have no impact on the market andprice stability. ``All should cooperate,'' he said.   The non-OPEC participants, who included Angola, China, Colombia,Egypt, Malaysia and Mexico, among others, said they agreed on anunspecified set of actions but wished to advise their own ministersbefore revealing them to OPEC.   At a first meeting of the two sides last April, independentproducers suggested a five percent cut.   Shanfari told the newspaper that his country was playing ``animportant role'' in such coordination.   The Sultanate produces about 600,000 barrels per day of which itexports about 550,000 barrels. It has in the past also restrictedits output to help OPEC stabilize the market.   According to the Middle East Economic Survey, a respectedindustry publication, Syria's exports will be made possible by anincrease in production from 270,000 barrels a day in 1988 to 350,000barrels a day in 1989.   The increase will come from the startup ``during the next fewweeks'' of the Omar field in northeast Syria with a capacity ofabout 100,000 barrels a day, the newsletter reported.   The new field is operated by the Al-Firat Petroleum Co. owned 50percent by the state-owned Syrian Petroleum Co. and by U.S. Shell'sPecten subsidiary (15.6 percent), Royal Dutch Shell (15.6 percent),and Deminex (18.75 percent). Royal Dutch Shell is the operator.   The publication said exports from the new field would start inFebruary or March mixed with crude oil from another producing field.</TEXT></DOC>
