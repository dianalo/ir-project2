Because of the improvement in the antifreezeoperation control of the heat collector, the running time of the heatcollector pump reduced by 40 % in the 3rd year than the 2nd year, whereasthe fan coil unit worked twice because it also worked in the winter.Operating conditions of the absorption type refrigerating unit was improvedevery year; the water temperature of the 1st heat collecting tank waschanged from 80 to 85 `C by which the loss at the start-up was reduced.A day-light utilization system utilizing an optical fiber was experimentalilyinstalled. Cooling by exterior air or night purging was simulated; theresult was not enough to reduce the internal temperature, however, resultingonly in a certain wall temperature reduction.
