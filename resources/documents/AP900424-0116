The 90-minute tape aired Sunday by the private TF1 networkdepicted the secret trial, execution and burial of the RomanianCommunist dictator and his wife Dec. 25 at a military base outsideBucharest.   The network claims a Sunday-night record 10 million peoplewatched the broadcast, ``The Ceausescus' Final Hours.''   TF1 says it paid $9,000 to an unidentified Romanian for the tapeafter an Austrian network rejected it. Network officials called theprice ``cheap'' and billed the broadcast Sunday as a worldexclusive.   But Razvan Theodorescu, head of state-run Free RomanianTelevision, said Monday that TF1 had purchased an illegal copy ofthe tape, undercutting a deal being negotiated with a French salesagent over world rights to the film.   ``The rights to this cassette belong to the Romaniangovernment,'' Theodorescu said in Bucharest, before leaving on atrip to Paris. ``It's immoral to want to make money with a historicdocument reflecting the drama lived through by the Romanianpeople.''   He said TF1 was duped into buying a ``pirate cassette'' andaccused those who sold it of criminal behavior.   Patrick Le Lay, president-director general of TF1, denied thatany illegal act was committed.   ``What was proposed to us was the uncut cassette of the trial,and we haven't pirated anybody,'' he said Monday.   The tape shows Ceausescu weeping and his wife screaming formercy as guards tied their hands shortly before their execution.The camera focused on Elena Ceausescu lying in a stream of bloodafter a firing squad gunned down the couple.   Extracts of the tape first aired in December. But the longversion broadcast by TF1 showed for the first time the full trialof the couple by the secret military-civilian tribunal thatsentenced them to death.   The show-trial atmosphere and the brutal, graphic images of theexecution drew criticism in the French media.   The conservative daily Le Figaro called it ``a political trialthat bears no relation to justice. It would doubtless have beenbetter to kill the Ceausescus right away than to put on thismacabre farce.''   The TF1 broadcast scooped Free Romanian Television, which airedthe footage later Sunday to mark the four-month anniversary of therevolution that ended Ceausescu's 25-year rule.   The French network billed its version as the complete,definitive account of the couple's final hours.   But Theodorescu claimed after arriving in Paris late Monday thata more complete tape contains additional debate among the tribunalmembers over charges that the Ceausescus committed genocide againstthe Romanian people.   The Romanian government will continue distribution negotiationsover the longer tape with French agent Jean-Loup Sulitzer,Theodorescu said. Earnings will go toward technologicalimprovements in Romanian television.</TEXT></DOC>
