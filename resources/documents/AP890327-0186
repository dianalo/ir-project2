WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>COLOGNE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The war veterans at the RiehlerHome for the Aged tend to get more riled up about the earrings andtiger-striped pants worn by ``civvies'' than the fact that theyoung men have refused military service.   Civvies, or civilian servants, are conscientious objectors whoopt for their constitutional right to reject military service andwork instead in the most menial of health care and manual laborjobs.   Amid an increasingly tolerant West German public and an imminentlengthening of both military and civilian service terms, the numberof young men filing for conscientious objector status has climbeddramatically in recent months.   The pacifist corps grew by more than 22 percent last year alone,swelling the force to a record 85,000 and rekindling worries amongsome labor union officials that the civvies who earn only about 300marks ($160) a month will take jobs away from regular workers.   On the whole, however, civvies are finding widespread acceptanceamong their countrymen.   ``We have occasional problems between the conservative olderresidents and the Civilian Service workers, but it is more often anobjection about the kind of clothes they wear than their moral orpolitical views,'' observed Josef Gerlach, a psychologist in chargeof care for the 1,200 residents of the Riehler home, the nation'slargest facility for the elderly.   ``The residents are actually more likely to lash out at eachother, calling this or that one an old Nazi.''   Civvies like 24-year-old Gerd Daassen, who has been feeding,bathing and cleaning up residents at the Riehler home sinceOctober, confirm that their decisions against bearing arms stirlittle hostility.   ``A lot of them ask me why I am doing this instead of serving inthe army,'' Daasaen said during a break. ``But it seems to be morea curiosity than a judgment. When I tell them that I cannot killanother man, and therefore have to reject military service, theyseem to understand.''   Peter Hintze, federal commissioner for the Civilian Service,said in an interview at his Bonn office that he considers the broadacceptance of conscientious objection in West Germany ``a sign of ahealthy and mature society.''   ``In the 1960s, the public reaction was very negative. Thephrase used then for civilian servants was `shirker','' saidHintze, a former Anglican minister. ``In the 1970s, there wasmostly skepticism, `Who are these guys?' people wondered. But now,as the 1980s draw to a close, the choice of civilian service isbroadly accepted.''   The pacifist trend among West Germans began abruptly in 1968, ayear of widespread student protests against militarism and a timeof anxiety over the Vietnam War.   Refusal to bear arms has grown steadily ever since.   Hintze and his adviser, Achim Schmidt, attribute most of thesharp rise in civilian service entries over the past year to theDefense Ministry's plan to lengthen the obligatory army servicefrom 15 to 18 months beginning in June.   The civilian service term now is 20 months but will be extendedto two years after June.   ``The willingness to serve longer demonstrates commitment to thealternative service,'' said Hintze, a civvie himself in the 1970s.   Civvies serve longer because they often can find positions intheir own communities, while soldiers have to wear uniforms, put inlonger hours and live away from home.   All West German men reaching the age of 18 are obligated toregister for military service, but education deferments are easilyobtained.   Hintze said the percentage of military draftees refusing armyservice has grown steadily over the past two decades to about 12percent. That figure is significantly larger than in neighboringcountries, where usually less than 1 percent called for servicerefuse to bear arms.   West Germans' acceptance of conscientious objectors can beexplained in part by the nation's tragic experience with war andmilitarism during the first half of this century and its positionon the frontline with Eastern Europe.   The nation's Basic Law, set down 40 years ago when the newpostwar West German state was formed, was the first constitution inthe world to grant citizens the right to chose an alternative tomilitary service.   The civvies most often find jobs caring for the elderly andhandicapped, but they also get into fields like environmentalprotection, zoo and park maintenance and search and rescue.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, April 3</NOTE></DOC>
