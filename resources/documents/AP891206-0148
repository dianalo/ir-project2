It was the first time since the military rebellion began Fridaythat the Bush administration had voiced concerns about the mutiny'slong-term effects on Aquino's future.   The official spoke a little more than an hour before news camefrom Manila that rebel troops holding a downtown district hadagreed to return to their barracks.   The administration official, in an apparent attempt to send aclear signal to Aquino, said the United States must now ``reassesswhat all this means'' in terms of U.S. assistance to her government.   He did not elaborate.   But the official called the insurrection a ``serious'' attemptto topple Mrs. Aquino and said she should regard it as such.   He called on Mrs. Aquino to seek to ``eliminate the sources ofdiscontent which helped lead to the coup'' as she struggles toreassert control.   Asked if Aquino could survive politically if she succeedsmilitarily in putting down the rebel forces, the official said:   ``That's a tough one.   ``There has been a lot of criticism of her from the army'' fornot giving military leaders more of a free hand in cracking down onthe leftist New People's Army and for ``ignoring the military,''the official said.   ``I don't know if it's justified or not. It is what theybelieve,'' he went on, adding that the criticism is ``a symptom offeelings. And, as a political leader, she has to deal with it.''   It is elements of Aquino's own army that are rebelling againsther now. The U.S. official noted that the restiveness in themilitary gave Col. Gregorio Honasan, a leader of the coup attempt,far more support over the last week than he had when he led aprevious effort to oust Mrs. Aquino.   Earlier, U.S. officials praised as ``careful and effective'' aPhilippine evacuation that freed 280 Americans and other foreignersfrom the Manila hotels where they had been trapped by gunfire inthe six-day-old rebellion.   ``We commend the Aquino government for organizing and carryingout this operation,'' said State Department spokeswoman MargaretTutwiler, applauding the ``careful and effective manner in which itdealt with the situation in the Makati commercial district and theefforts it took to safeguard American citizens and others who werein the area.''   The evacuation followed negotiations between the Aquinogovernment and the rebels ``into the early hours'' of Wednesday toreach a cease-fire, she said, but declined to comment on restraintshown by the rebels. U.S. officials had no contact with the rebels,she said.   ``It's unfortunate that the rebels caused this situation,'' Ms.Tutwiler said. ``We are obviously not going to get out here in aposition and applaud the rebels. We are applauding the Aquinogovernment.''   All those trapped in the hotel district were freed withoutinjury, she said, and were taken by bus to processing centers setup by the U.S. Embassy to help them contact relatives and makelodging and travel plans.   ``While the situation has improved, we continue to urge Americancitizens to exercise caution,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.   Aquino's declaration of a state of national emergency was``totally, legally what she has done under their constitution,''Ms. Tutwiler said, declining further comment on the Philippinegovernment's response to the week-old rebellion.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also declinedcomment on the emergency declaration other than to say, ``We willtake a look at it and see if we have any concerns.''   Some 2,000 foreigners had been trapped for four days in hotelsby the military coup attempt that had left at least 79 dead and 570wounded since Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
