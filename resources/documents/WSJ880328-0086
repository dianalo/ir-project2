Carroll (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> EDP </IN><TEXT>   Despite computers' spreading reign in the workplace, the chore of filling out forms has stubbornly resisted automation.    Workers still rummage after that elusive petty-cash slip and usually tear up several false starts before getting it right. Companies still spend billions of dollars printing and storing forms --- and destroying them when, say, an address changes.    But a few companies are about to offer personal-computer software that should make designing and completing forms less frustrating, and ultimately make handling them less costly. While some hurdles remain, many analysts and potential customers are confident that such software will become a huge part of the computer industry within a couple of years.    &quot;This will be as big as desktop publishing,&quot; says Kathy Lane, an analyst at Dataquest Inc., a San Jose, Calif., market-research firm. &quot;We're talking billions and billions of dollars a year&quot; in sales of software and of the hardware sophisticated enough to run it.    Mountain View, Calif.-based Claris Corp., an Apple Computer Inc. spinoff, and SoftView Inc. in Camarillo, Calif., will provide software that works on Apple's Macintosh, while Columbia Software Inc. in Northridge, Calif., will launch a product that runs on personal computers compatible with International Business Machines Corp. models. Versions with design capability will cost around $400; those that assist only in filling out the forms will sell for about $100 to $150. (A more limited version of the latter kind was introduced for the Macintosh late last year by Madison, Wis.based Spectrum Digital Systems Inc.)    Although the new packages differ in some respects, they will all let users call up on a screen a form, programmed in by the users' company, that looks exactly like a familiar printed form. They will display forms that do any necessary calculations automatically -- for instance, adding up all the outlays on an expense account, comparing the sum with advances, and figuring out how much the employer or employee is owed.    Users will also be able to place the cursor on any part of the form they don't understand and get instructions on filling it in. In the case of the Columbia and SoftView products, those instructions could even lead to another form, such as might be required for someone trying to figure out how many deductions to take on a federal tax return. Totals from the second form could be automatically inserted on the appropriate lines in the main form.    Altering forms will become simpler as well. At the moment, merely changing the size of a piece of type on a form can lead to so many changes that the designer needs to start from scratch to build a form. But form software will automatically adjust other parts of the form to accommodate all sorts of changes.    &quot;One of the classic problems when you draw a form,&quot; says Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of Soft*letter, a Cambridge, Mass., newsletter, &quot;is that when you finish . . . somebody says, 'It's perfect, but we have to add these two things to satisfy the legal department and this one thing to satisfy corporate.' And you have to start over.&quot;    In addition, the software will save the cost of typing into the computer the data needed to keep track of, say, a company's order rate.    Within six months to two years, the software will be enhanced to allow for automatic routing of the forms on a computer network. Thus, someone filling out an invoice could also send it to a supervisor, to the manufacturing operation and to the shipping department, which would receive the information as a packing list.    Many companies and some software makers have already experimented with such software on a limited scale. But broader application has only recently become possible because of the advent of inexpensive laser printers and of personal computers powerful enough to display the complex graphics that forms require.    Despite the improved hardware and the new software, however, the automation of form processing won't be immediate. Routing forms over personal-computer networks assumes that networks exist -- but they aren't yet used extensively. A change-over assumes, too, that enough employees at a company have access to a personal computer, which often isn't the case. And it takes a year or two to work the kinks out of a new type of software.    Moreover, some companies may wait for future refinements. &quot;If we're going to do this electronically, I'd think we'd first want the form linked to a data base,&quot; says W.N. Burdick, director of technology at William Blair andamp; Co., a Chicago-based brokerage firm. &quot;And it would be rather key that they run on a local area network.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
