For several weeks Mr. Edelman had been rumored to be accumulating stock in the Livingston, N.J.-based engineering and construction services concern.    On Friday, as on previous occasions in recent weeks, a spokesman for Mr. Edelman declined to comment on Foster Wheeler. But individuals familiar with the purchase said Mr. Edelman had a stake after a report on Cable News Network Thursday night.    A Foster Wheeler official declined to comment on Mr. Edelman. The company earlier last month declined to comment on the unusually heavy trading activity in Foster Wheeler shares.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Foster Wheeler closed at $23.25 a share, up 50 cents, on the list of most active stocks with volume of 1,533,400 shares.    It wasn't immediately known whether Mr. Edelman was accumulating Foster Wheeler shares as an investment, or whether he plans to make a bid for the company.    Mr. Edelman's takeover investments have had mixed results in recent years. Last month, Mr. Edelman and Dominion Textile Inc. lost out in their effort to acquire Burlington Industries Inc. The company was bought by a group led by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., but Mr. Edelman and Dominion stand to earn a total of more than $60 million in profit.    In January, a group Mr. Edelman led prevailed in an unsolicited $235 million bid for Ponderosa Inc., a Dayton, Ohio, restaurant company. Two months later he called off a long battle to buy Lucky Stores Inc., a Dublin, Calif., supermarket chain that had bitterly fought Mr. Edelman. </TEXT></DOC>
