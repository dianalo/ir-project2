In practice theymight be among the most neglected.   This dichotomy still shows in surveys of American corporatepractices, even though the consequences are well understood bymanagement and labor, having caused them serious problems in thepast.   Further evidence comes in an analysis of 105 responses to asurvey of Fortune 500 companies by Organizational Dynamics Inc., amanagement consulting and training company based in Burlington,Mass.   The survey found executives are virtually unanimous in theirbelief that responsibility for quality must be shared by everyonein the company. Almost all agreed that ``everyone in the companyaffects customer satisfaction.''   The questioning continued, leading to this finding:   In the typical company surveyed, just 25 percent of workers wereinvolved in quality improvement activities. Only 17 percent of therespondents said their company involves more than half itsemployees.   The results underscore what many quality improvement specialistshave been saying for years, that one of the major quality defectsof American industry is the failure to follow through on corporategoals.   The problem isn't one of recognition. Almost every executivewill explain that quality and service are foremost among corporategoals. Awareness probably has never been higher. The consequencesof poor quality are known.   In fact, the current emphasis on quality arises directly fromthe painful experience American industry had with poor qualityduring the 1960s, when U.S. companies began losing entire marketsto the Japanese, who embraced quality.   Oddly, much of the quality control practiced by the Japaneseemerged from the U.S. experience, and from Americans who had raisedit to the level of a science, including W. Edwards Deming andArmand V. Feigenbaum.   Oddly, some major American corporations intentionally letquality to deteriorate, contending it was more cost-effective toallow flawed products to leave the factory, to be fixed later byservice departments.   It didn't work, largely because after-sale service was likewiseflawed. That is, the quality of service was as bad as the qualityof the product, and customers quickly became aware of it. Why not?They sensed they were being exploited.   Much of the subsequent recovery of U.S. industry, now showing upas a resurgence of manufacturing, productivity gains, improvedtrade statistics and healthier profits, is a consequence of effortsto improve quality and service.   But survey after survey shows that the notion of quality andservice is more deeply imbedded than the practice. Everyone cheersfor improvements, but not nearly as many go to work after thecheering stops.   In the Organizational Dynamics survey, respondents agreed thatquality and service control are matters that involve employees atall levels, but only one-third said they shared customersatisfaction data with all employees.   As one of the foremost authorities on quality control, Philip B.Crosby, has stated often _ he even wrote a book about it _``quality is free.''   It may not cost even a penny to begin with, he says, but if itcosts anything at all the cost comes back many times in highersales.   Underlying his assumption is faith in human beings to dosuperior work if given the direction and the motivation, and ifgiven a return on their efforts to contribute.
