The document, read to the Iran-Contra jury by North's defenseattorneys, placed Bush at a May 1985 meeting in Honduras withthen-President Roberto Suazo. It says Bush informed Suazo ofPresident Reagan's decision to speed U.S. military and economic aidto the country.   What set up the Bush meeting were behind-the-scenes discussionsamong North and other U.S. officials on a plan to seek assistancefrom other countries to tide over the Nicaraguan rebels at a timewhen direct or indirect American assistance was outlawed byCongress.   A preface to the document said ``the United States has admittedfor purposes of this trial the following facts to be true,'' and itwent to lengths to stitch together how the secret covert supportprogram worked.   In effect, the Reagan program established a ``quid pro quo''relationship basing U.S. assistance to Honduras and some othercountries at least in part on those countries' willingness to helpsustain the Contra fighting force.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former NATO commander wants to reduce thealliance's active conventional forces by 50 percent, with theWarsaw Pact cutting its strength to the same number of troops.
