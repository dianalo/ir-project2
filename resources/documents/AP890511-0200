Experts say a dramatic increase in elephant poaching has beenspurred by record world prices for ivory. Ivory sells for about $91a pound, and an average tusk weighs 11 pounds.   ``The policing of the elephants' survival is not easy, but itwill be more practical if any ivory trade is banned,'' N. KatanaNgala, minister of tourism and wildlife, said at a news conference.   Conservationists believe there are about 750,000 elephants lefton the continent. They say poachers are killing about 75,000 of themammals a year. If the slaughter continues at that rate, thepopulation could be wiped out by the year 2000.   An aerial survey last year found an estimated 20,000 elephantsin Kenya, which 15 years ago had an elephant population of 121,000.Ngala said the government will conduct another count in June andJuly.   He said Kenya submitted its recommendation on a trade banThursday to the Lausanne, Switzerland-based Convention In Trade OfEndangered Species.   If two-thirds of the convention's approximately 100 members voteto list elephants on the convention's Appendix One at the group'snext meeting in October, international trade in elephant productswould be banned.   Tanzania and Somalia, Kenya's neighbors to the south and eastrespectively, have submitted similar proposals to the convention,said Richard Leakey, Kenya's director of wildlife.   However, countries such as Japan, a major ivory consumer, arelikely to oppose the proposal.   Zimbabwe, one of the few African nations with a growing elephantpopulation, has annual elephant kills and a thriving legal trade inelephant products. In the last 12 months it has earned about$600,000 in legal ivory sales.   Ngala said that while Kenya realizes some African countrieswould suffer from an ivory trade ban, such action is crucial if theelephant is to survive.   Kenya also plans to fence parts of its wildlife parks to betterprotect elephants, Leakey said.   Since the beginning of the year, he said, as many as 300elephants have been killed in Kenya's parks.</TEXT></DOC>
