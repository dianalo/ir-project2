(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Instant Digital PhotographyandM;HANDS ON by Jonathan Matzkin Imaging has always been one of the thorniestproblems faced by low-end desktop publishers.andM;Scanners are not only expensive but also impractical.andP;  You can't really scan3-D objects (people, for instance), and while photographs can be easilyscanned, you must first shoot and process the image, which takes hours if notdays.andP;  Dycam's $995 Model 1 Digital Still Camera isn't a perfect solution,but it solves many of these DTP imaging problems.andM;The Dycam differs from still video cameras in at least one crucial way.andO;While still video systems like Canon's Xap Shot (First Looks, March 26, 1991)record analog images, which must be converted to digital form for use in PCdocuments, the Dycam stores its images in digital form, in the familiar,widely supported TIFF format.andP;  That means that you simply shoot the picture,transfer it to your hard disk with the included cable and software, and useit as you would any other TIFF image file.andM;This functional simplicity extends to the design of the camera itself.andP;  TheDycam is almost devoid of physical features.andP;  Its sleek, compact body (6.5 by3 by 1.25 inches HWD) has a viewfinder for framing an image, and a singlepush button to snap the shot.andP;  Anyone who can use a conventionalpoint-and-shoot camera can successfully use the Dycam within 5 minutes ofpulling it out of the box.andM;The camera can hold up to 32 images in its internal memory.andP;  Images aretransferred to your PC through a cable that attaches to the din plug on thehost adapter and to any DB-9 serial port on your PC.andM;The DOS software included with the Dycam is rudimentary in terms of interfacedesign and is not particularly feature-rich, but it is effective and simpleto use.andP;  One feature lets you display miniature versions of the imagestransferred from the camera.andP;  Arrayed across your screen, the small imageslook like a photographer's proof sheet, and they serve a similar function.andO;To view a full-sized image, you simply highlight one of the thumbnail imagesand press Enter.andM;The package also includes Windows software.andP;  The software has similarfunctionality, but it saves the images as .BMP or TIFF files.andP;  It took sometinkering with protocols and data transfer rates to get either version of thesoftware to run properly on my 486/33.andP;  Dycam says that the problem ariseswhen the camera tries to transmit images at a high baud rate through a serialport on some systems.andP;  The company also plans to distribute Picture Publisherimage-andM;manipulation software with the camera in the near future.andM;As a camera, the Dycam is no threat to makers of conventional photoequipment.andP;  Its 376-column by 240-row resolution is high enough to generate agood image, but there is basically no comparison between the Dycam's outputat VGA resolution and a conventional photograph.andP;  As the images are printedor displayed in larger sizes, image quality suffers.andM;The Dycam's simplicity is a two-edged sword.andP;  The fixed-focus lens isdesigned to capture images from approximately 3 feet to infinity.andP;  It workspretty well at longer distances, but there was noticeable distortion in astreet scene that I snapped, particularly in the background.andP;  The lens isalso unsuitable for extreme close-ups.andP;  Dycam offers wide angle, telephotoand close-up kit options at additional cost.andM;At around $1,000, the Dycam Model 1 is a bit pricey to use as the familysnapshot camera.andP;  But as prices come down, its ease of use and the instantgratification of seeing an image on-screen in a matter of seconds might makethe Dycam as common as today's camcorders.andM;LOGITECH RELEASES VERSION OF STILL CAMERAandM;Many new hardware products are hampered initially by the lack of widespreadthird-party support and by the lack of effective software.andP;  So it bodes wellfor the future of low-cost digital photo imaging that Logitech has decided toenter the low-cost digital imaging market.andM;Logitech, one of the largest makers of input devices and associated software,has purchased Dycam's digital camera technology, and will manufacture andsell it with its own manipulation software for $799.andP;  Logitech's version ofthe camera is physically very similar to the Dycam, but has differentfirmware, according to aandM;Logitech spokesperson.andP;  The hardware/software bundle, dubbed the FotoMan, isslated for an October release, according to Logitech.andM;As with the Dycam system, images are downloaded from Logitech's camera via aPC-based software module.andP;  Photos are displayed as a series of small previewimages laid out like a photographer's contact sheet.andP;  They are thenautomatically imported into FotoTouch, an upgrade of Logitech's Anselimage-manipulation package, which has previously been sold with Logitech'sScanMan hand scanner.andM;A Windows application, FotoTouch provides a wide range of image-manipulationand file-conversion capabilities.andP;  The software allows users to store imagesin .BMP, .PCX, or any of three TIFF file formats, according to Logitech.andO;Among other options, FotoTouch also allows images to be edited pixel bypixel, rotated, or stiched to other images.andP;  They can be stored in 16, 64, or256 gray levels, and in dithered, error-diffused or black-and-white line artmodes.--J.M.andM;Dycam Model 1 Digital Still CameraandM;Dycam Inc., 9588 Topanga Canyon Blvd., Chatsworth, CA 91311;
