Among those making recent acquisition bids are USAir, Chrysler, Harcourt Brace, Dart Group and Martin Sosnoff, despite predictions that Jan. 1 tax changes would slow down mergers. Rising stock prices are forcing bidders to offer more for their targets than in 1986.    Acquirers are in a hurry because they fear legislators might clamp down on mergers, investment bankers say. &quot;There's a sense that this window won't be open very long,&quot; says David Kay of Drexel Burnham Lambert. Some investors like Mr. Sosnoff, whose bid for Caesars World has been rebuffed, say they're stepping forward because interest rates might soon rise, boosting acquisition costs.    Bidders are throwing big numbers around, judging by commonly used measures. USAir's $69-a-share bid for Piedmont Aviation represents 83 cents for every $1 of Piedmont's revenue, says Tim Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst. In 1986, USAir paid 50 cents per $1 of PS Group's revenue. AMR paid 70 cents per $1 of AirCal's revenue.    Dart Group's initial $41.75-a-share offer for Supermarkets General represents 3.5 times the food chain's book value, says Robert Raiff, a C.J. Lawrence analyst. In 1986, the average tab for food chains was 2.5 times book.    Jack Kent Cooke has agreed to pay almost $1,800 a subscriber for McCaw Communications' cable assets, says Barry Kaplan of Goldman Sachs, compared with an average price of roughly $1,500 a subscriber in 1986.    Takeovers started slowly in 1987. Salomon Brothers counted $14.9 billion of pending and completed mergers, acquisitions and leveraged buyouts in the first two months. There were $21.3 billion such transactions in December 1986. But the recent flurry of deals could put first-quarter 1987 totals on a par with the 1986 first quarter, Salomon says.    Last year, some pundits predicted takeovers would fall 50% in 1987 and acquisition prices, 10% to 15%. Many acquirers face higher taxes and less cash flow because they can no longer mark up the value of certain assets tax-free before depreciating or selling them. Acquirers in 1987 also benefit much less from an acquired company's tax benefits.    In 1986, says Robert Willens, a Peat Marwick Mitchell accountant, an acquirer could have placed market values on Harper andamp; Row Publishers' intangible assets such as contracts with authors, depreciating the higher asset values without paying up-front taxes. Harcourt and Theodore Cross are bidding for Harper.    A buyer of Caesars World could have sold some of its land at market prices without paying taxes. And Chrysler could have used American Motors' tax-loss carry-forwards to offset much larger amounts of taxable profit than this year, Mr. Willens says.    It might make sense for some acquirers to pay up despite the loss of many tax benefits. Some book publishers' and casino companies' earnings prospects are improving. All acquisitions are cheaper to finance than in 1986. Currently, &quot;acquirers are looking at a blended financing rate&quot; on bank loans and junk bonds of 12% or less, down from 13.5% a year ago, says C.J. Lawrence's Mr. Raiff.    Most mergers aren't driven by tax benefits, investment bankers add. There's only one U.S. auto maker Chrysler could buy to add more vehicles and distribution. Airlines that don't want to be crushed by giant Texas Air or AMR have to merge. Media concerns that want to grow must scramble for the few major cable systems or television stations available. CBS issued $400 million of bonds Friday, saying it might buy TV stations.    &quot;It's a seller's market,&quot; says Goldman's Mr. Kaplan.    Shares of some rumored takeover targets languished yesterday in a weak market. But analysts foresee more acquisitions. They say future airline targets could include Alaska Air, Midway Airlines and even UAL, which has Donald Trump as a big investor.    Meanwhile, there's revived speculative interest in supermarket chains like Albertson's and Kroger as well as in Southland, a convenience-store chain. The bids for Harper have sparked interest in Macmillan and other publishers.    Some traders think active investors like Mr. Trump, Mr. Sosnoff and Dart just want to attract higher bids by friendly companies. Rising stock prices and tax changes, among other things, may make it less advantageous for raiders to force asset-rich companies like UAL to sell major operations to buy back stock, they say.    In 1986, raiders prompted Holiday and others like TW Services' predecessor Transworld to break themselves up. But the tax status of such liquidations is cloudy and they might be less profitable. A 1987 liquidation of Lear Siegler -- recently taken private by Forstmann Little -- would have yielded at least 25% less than in 1986, according to earlier estimates by investment bankers.    Liquidations and leveraged buyouts &quot;that depend on asset sales&quot; seem to have fallen off, says Charles Nathan, a Salomon merger specialist. Instead of &quot;finding an asset-rich company and splitting it up,&quot; adds Dan Lee, a Drexel analyst, more people will buy good businesses and try to run them better than former managers. </TEXT></DOC>
