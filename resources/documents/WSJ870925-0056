The unit, to be called DuBois Chemicals Inc., supplies cleaning products to institutional and industrial customers. It accounted for about $238 million, or 66% of Chemed's $359.5 million in revenue last year.    The specialty chemicals concern said the transfer would facilitate an initial public offering of DuBois's stock, if financial and market conditions warrant. Chemed said it would retain ownership of at least 80% of DuBois shares if the unit is eventually established as a publicly held company. </TEXT></DOC>
