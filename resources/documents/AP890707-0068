Joe) McCarthy'snotorious anti-communist, anti-China legislation,'' the paper said.``And 100 years after the declaration of the emancipation ofAmerica's slaves, the discrimination faced by blacks and people ofother colors is still serious.''   Washington suspended military sales and high-level governmentalexchanges after the Chinese army's bloody suppression of protestersseeking democratic reforms. China says 200 to 300 people died;Western sources and Chinese witnesses say up to 3,000 people werekilled.   In addition to the sanctions, the Chinese government has beenangered by U.S. protection of dissident Fang Lizhi, who with hiswife, Li Shuxian, took shelter at the American Embassy shortly afterthe crackdown.   Noting U.S. criticism of South Africa and its involvement inKorea, Vietnam and Grenada, the paper said Washington ``has neverstopped its interference with other countries' internal affairs.This is the reality of the American `guardians of human rights'.''   In a separate piece titled ``How America Tramples On HumanRights,'' the Communist Party mouthpiece printed a chronology ofcivil rights and antiwar protests in the United States, completewith numbers of arrests and deaths of demonstrators.   In another story, the People's Daily said student leaders passedon state secrets to foreign journalists and received foreignpassports so they could escape from China.   ``The autonomous student union, through the help of foreignpowers, even obtained passports for some 40 of their members, sothey could flee the country in the event things turned for theworse,'' newspaper said.   It did not name any countries that provided passports but saidconsiderable financial support came from the United States andFrance and said people from Hong Kong operated from rooms at theBeijing Hotel near the square to distribute money to students.   ``The student leaders maintained illicit relations withtraitorous organizations overseas, and themselves were traitors andcollaborators,'' it said.   The People's Daily also repeated charges that students receivedmoney from overseas, saying: ``When the student leader `masterminds'finally went underground, each had tens of thousands of yuan(thousands of dollars).''   Major Chinese papers also gave prominent play to a lengthy speechby Beijing's conservative mayor, Chen Xitong, attacking a wide rangeof intellectuals for contributing to the political environment thatfostered the democracy movement.   Chen's speech, to the National People's Congress a week ago butonly released Thursday, took up three full newspaper pages andlashed out at a number of writers, editors and dissidents whoseairing of political positions ``prepared for the turmoil thatensued.''   The spreading purge of intellectuals included news reports of theousting of a deputy editor-in-chief of the Huayue publishing housein rural Shaanxi province and the burning of a book the firmpublished, ``The Story of a Chinese Who Never Lies,'' because itallegedly embraces bourgeois liberalism, or Western liberal ideas.   He also leveled further charges at former Communist Party chiefZhao Ziyang, who was sacked last month for his pro-student views. Hewas replaced by Shanghai party chief and political hard-liner JiangZemin.   The evening news showed writers and artists saying Zhao neglectedpolitical education and blamed him for what they said was aproliferation of low-quality artistic works, including pornography.   ``For many years, there was no serious and completeimplementation of the policies of the Central Committee. Before, wedidn't know what happened. Now, it's clear. The reason was ComradeZhao Ziyang,'' said Zhang Jiong, a researcher at the Chinese Academyof Social Sciences.</TEXT></DOC>
