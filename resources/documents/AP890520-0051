The Ministry of Government and Justice issued a communiquesaying the prohibition was imposed in response to the visit nextweek by delegates from the Organization of American States, or OAS.   The move came after Panama accused the U.S. Embassy ofinvolvement in post-election violence earlier this month that leftthree opposition leaders injured and one of their bodyguards dead.   The foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad andTobago, accompanied by OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares, aredue in Panama on Tuesday. They will try to promote resolution ofPanama's 15-month-old crisis.   The OAS on Wednesday approved a resolution critical of Panama'sde facto leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, whom it heldresponsible for ``abuses.''   International observers say opposition candidates were winningthe national election on May 7 when the government annulled theresults. Since then, there has been no decision on how to select areplacement for acting President Manuel Solis Palma, whose termends Sept. 1.   The government said the prohibition of marches, rallies anddemonstrations is in response to the clause in the OAS resolutioncalling on ``the authorities and all political forces in Panama toabstain from any measure or action that could aggravate thecrisis.''   The government communique said the prohibition will remain ineffect until the three foreign ministers present their report onthe Panamanian situation at OAS headquarters in Washington. The OASgave them until June 5 to do so.   Late Friday, U.S. Embassy spokesman Terry Kneebone, respondingto a government communique, said the attempt to link the U.S.government to the election-related violence was ``propagandafoolishness.''   Police arrested 17 Panamanians who provide security at U.S.Embassy offices, the embassy reported Friday. Fifteen were quicklyreleased, embassy officials said.   The government said the guards were questioned as part of aninvestigation into violence May 10, three days after the nationalelection.   The 17 work for the same private security company that employedan opposition politician's bodyguard who was killed and another whowas wounded when Noriega supporters attacked members of theopposition with sticks, pipes and rubber whips.   The government claimed the bodyguards were trained by the U.S.military, whose presence was bolstered when President Bush recentlysent in nearly 1,900 troops to U.S. bases to protect Americannationals in the country.   Also Friday, the pro-Noriega news media attacked the OAS, sayingit had prostituted itself in approving a resolution critical ofPanama.   The newspaper Critica printed a half-page cartoon on Fridayshowing a naked Oscar Arias, president of Costa Rica and winner ofthe Nobel Peace Prize, licking the feet of a U.S. Army general.Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez was shown waiting his turnto do the same.   The governments of Arias and Perez promoted the resolutionadopted Wednesday by the OAS that criticized Noriega, who also ishead of the 15,000-strong Defense Forces.   The 17 Panamanians who were detained work for Tesna ProtectiveServices, an American company that operates in Panama under thename Minsa. The company provides by contract 87 employees who serveas security personnel for U.S. diplomatic offices. They are notemployees of the U.S. Embassy.   The bodyguard killed in the May 10 violence was Alexis Guerra, aMinsa employee who was on leave from the company while he protectedopposition vice presidential candidate Guillermo Ford. Among thewounded was another bodyguard, Humberto Montenegro, who had beenemployed by Minsa until early this year when he resigned to work asFord's bodyguard. The government has said five Defense Forcesoldiers were injured in the melee.   A communique issued Friday night by the attorney general'soffice accused the U.S. Embassy of lying to the media about thedetention of the 17 Minsa employees and claimed the embassypresented the detentions as harassment.   The statement also said ``high authorities'' of the U.S. Embassyassigned Guerra and Montenegro to guard Ford. It claimed the twomen and other Minsa guards were trained in the use of arms andexplosives by U.S. military units stationed in Panama.   Kneebone said both allegations were false. He said the embassyconferred with the 15 who were released.</TEXT></DOC>
