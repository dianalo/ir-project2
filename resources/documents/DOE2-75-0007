This system consists of the realtime data acquisition system, the main processing system, the graphicdisplay system, and the dose assessment system. We have used the realtime data processing techniques for the data acqisition, the data communication,and the historical data base. The graphic display system that has thehuman factor engineered man-machine interface subsystem provides theplant operators with the useful information for the nuclear power plantin real time. In radiological dose assessment system, we have built themodels of the radiological exposure analysis and the atmospheric diffusionof the radioactive material.</TEXT></DOC>
