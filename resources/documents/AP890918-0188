For the first time since Mexico plunged into an economic crisisin 1982 and a little more than nine months into President CarlosSalinas de Gortari's term, the signs are going up outside plants andfactories scrambling for workers.   ``Two years ago it was hard for someone over 35 to find a job.Now we're placing people as old as 50,'' said Tomas Acosta, head ofthe placement service for Monterrey's National Federation ofIndependent Unions.   Bacilio Ortiz, personnel manager for a contractor buildingMonterrey's first subway, said he had to go into the countryside tofind workers.   ``We're looking for people that will do hard work,'' he said.``There are people here but they prefer to work inside where it'sair conditioned.''   ``Oh, there's work,'' said Rosa Maria Garcia, who runs a smallmeat market in a working class neighborhood. ``But many people stillcan't make it.''   She said the average consumer is still living with the economiccrisis, still buying less meat, cheaper cuts or stretching it instews.   The average worker's buying power is still 50 percent below whatit was in 1981, the year before the collapse, and prices are goingup despite a wage and price freeze.   Nevertheless, positive signs have come with figures thatindicated Mexico's gross domestic product, the value of its goodsand services, was up 2.4 percent in the first part of 1989 over thesame period last year and that industrial production grew 4.7percent through May.   Salinas' administration had cautiously predicted annual growthwould reach about 1.5 percent while some independent analystspredicted 1 percent growth at best. But now analysts are projecting1989 annual growth in the same range _ 2.2 percent to 2.4 percent.   ``It's begun to neutralize the crisis,'' said Jorge Mancilla,director of economic studies for the Nuevo Leon state Chamber ofIndustries in Monterrey, which is 100 miles south of the Texasborder.   What some analysts are calling the ``mini-boom of 1989'' wouldhave been viewed as sluggish by the standards of 1981, the last yearof a boom that saw 8 percent annual growth rates fed by skyrocketingoil revenues.   ``The principal motor back then was the excess demand of thepublic sector. There isn't that right now,'' said Everardo Elizondo,general director of the economic forecasting firm Index.   But in a country that has lived through eight years of hardship _a foreign debt that topped $107 billion, triple-digit inflation,shrinking economic output, plummeting oil prices, plummetingsalaries, plummeting consumer buying power _ even minimal growth israising eyebrows.   ``Nobody knows for certain why the economy grew so fast at thebeginning of 1989. It wasn't forecast,'' said Elizondo.   Acosta said he has the answer. ``There's a feeling of confidenceagain,'' he said. ``It has to do with the attitude of thegovernment.''   Salinas has stepped up economic measures initiated by hispredecessor, Miguel de la Madrid, most notably the opening of theeconomy to imports. Salinas has said his greatest achievement so faris a renewed spirit of confidence.   Driving to reach a 6 percent annual growth rate by the end of histerm and create an economy that can provide jobs for 1 million newworkers a year, Salinas has sold off inefficient state-ownedcompanies, taken decisive action to fight corruption and unionfeatherbedding and pushed to encourage new investment by bothMexicans and foreigners.   ``In nine months we have a new foreign investment law,transporation has been deregulated, the financial system has beenderegulated, the economy is being reprivatized,'' said Mancilla.``These are giant steps toward modernization.''   Economic indicators from the first half of 1989 ``demonstrate atendency for sustained moderate growth,'' he said.   Exports of manufactured goods hit a record $5 billion through May_ 4{ times higher than in 1981.   The private sector has responded by increasing investments,especially in machinery, in order to compete with foreign importsand, for many, to enter the lucrative export market.   Private investment was up 3.6 percent through May compared withthe same period last year.   Last year Acosta received about 30 calls a month from companiesneeding workers and now he gets as many as 1,500.   Job applications have dropped by half, he said.   ``It hasn't gotten to the point of 1981, but it's going in thatdirection,'' Acosta said.   The demand for labor is beginning to drive the base salary up inmany companies. Ortiz, for example, pays 10 percent above minimumfor starting workers.   Shelby Theriot, manager of a pipe-contracting company, said hehad to offer 50 percent above the minimum to lure a primary schooldropout from the underground economy to work as a messenger.   The underground economy now accounts for about 25 percent ofgross domestic product, up from 10 percent to 15 percent before 1982.   ``In many ways it's more lucrative to have a stand at a fleamarket than being on salary,'' said Mancilla.   But the ``mini boom'' has not trickled down to people like44-year-old Mario Figueroa, who dropped out of school after thefourth grade.   He earns 30 percent above the minimum wage, the equivalent ofabout $30 a week. But with three school-age children at home, hesaid, ``It's very difficult to live.''   Still, Figueroa added that he was lucky to find a job working ata furniture manufacturer. He had lost his old job at anair-conditioning company when it was bought out.   In dollar terms, due to the plunge in the peso's value, thecurrent minimum wage is less than half the 1981 wage _ $3.25 a daytoday compared to $7.50 at the height of the boom.   Mancilla said there's no signs of a quick fix in consumer buyingpower.   ``The recovery in salaries could take until the next century,''he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Sept. 25</NOTE></DOC>
