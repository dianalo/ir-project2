Unexpectedreactions of heavy ion irradiated cellular systems such as an increasingRelative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) up to a LET of about 100 keV/{mu}mand then a decrease below 1 oblige to dismiss some conventional interpretations.Several years ago we suggested that, especially by higher ionizationdensity in addition to the DNA, repair systems and (or) membraneous systemscould also be injured (dual target theory). Our experiments with heavyions at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory with LET's between 102-970 keV/{mu}mon different types of mutations show a strict distinction between eventsconnected with fusion modalities (repair or misrepair) and those associatedwith nonfusion. With very high LET misrepair reactions just as translocationsdisappear, suggesting the direct damage of the repair systems and confirmingour previous experiments with peak pions and ions of LET's between 1100-4800keV/{mu}m.</TEXT></DOC>
