The vote sends the treaty to the full Senate, which is expectedto vote next month after returning from its Easter recess. Leadersof both parties say the treaty will win far more than thetwo-thirds margin it needs to be ratified.   But some Republicans said today the pact may be in jeopardybecause of a Democratic-backed amendment outlining how the treatycan be interpreted by the White House. The only dissenting votestoday were cast by Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Larry Pressler,R-S.D.   The treaty, signed Dec. 8 by President Reagan and Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev, requires both sides to desroy, within threeyears, all nuclear-tipped missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400miles. It will be the first nuclear arms control pact requiring thedestruction of weapons.   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said the Democratic amendment was``perhaps unconstitutional and very frankly, it may change myposition with respect to the treaty'' on the floor. But Boschwitzsupported the pact in today's vote.   Pressler predicted the amendment ``will lead to the defeat ofthis treaty because the votes aren't there.''   But Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the panel's chairman, said``the amendment's importance has been exaggerated'' and predictedits eventual approval by the full Senate.   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., called the pact ``a very importantstep forward'' for the United States.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., agreed. ``In effect, this is asmall step away from the nuclear brink,'' he told his colleagues.   Today's vote came a day after the amendment was added, a movethat left some committee Republicans angry and threatening tooppose the treaty when it comes to the floor.   ``This has been made partisan, unnecessarily in my view,'' Sen.Daniel Evans, R-Wash, said Tuesday. ``No one has worked harder forthis treaty than me, but I'm now going to seriously take a look atwhether I can vote for it.''   Evans and other Republicans were unhappy about theDemocratic-written provision, which was added to the measure withthe help of Helms.   The provision says no future president can change the U.S.interpretation of the treaty without the approval of Congress,either through a new pact or through a separate law.   The measure arises from a longstanding fight between Reagan andCongress over Reagan's assertion that the executive branch canunilaterally change how the U.S. government interprets a treaty.Congressional Democrats disagree with that statement, which Reaganhas used to justify some tests of his Star Wars missile defensesystem.   The tests would violate the original interpretation of the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   Democrats want assurances that Reagan or another president won'tassert the same right to re-interpret treaties on theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces pact.   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said Reagan already has agreed notto change the U.S. view of the INF treaty and said the proposal``is a deliberate attempt to embarrass the president.''   But Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., told Lugar, ``those of us onthis side did not begin this process,'' a reference to Reagan'sassertion involving executive branch rights on treatyinterpretation.   Helms said he offered his amendment, which he said made minorchanges in the Democratic-written proposal, to make sure theDemocratic measure was constitutional.   But Lugar was suspicious. ``I frankly don't know at all whatthis is about. I'm sure something important is going on,'' he said,but ``I don't have any idea.''   Earlier in the day, the Senate met in a rare secret session totalk about intelligence estimates about the size of the Soviets'force of SS-20 missiles, which will be destroyed under the treaty.   The Soviets have admitted to having 650 of the weapons, butHelms and other conservative critics argue that U.S. intelligenceestimates show that the Soviets may possess up to 1,000.Administration officials dispute that contention.   The secret session was the Senate's first since October 1986. Itwas held in the Old Senate Chamber, down the Capitol hall from thecurrent Senate meeting place. The current chamber was unusablebecause it is laced with electronic cables that could be tapped.   Helms said later that his colleagues, ``heard some things theyhadn't heard before.''</TEXT></DOC>
