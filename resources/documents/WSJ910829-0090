Oneteems with new robots and builds some of General MotorsCorp.'s luxury models. The other, also owned by GM, cranksalong with 1960s-vintage technology knocking outplain-vanilla family cars.   Guess which builds cars better.</LP><TEXT>   It's the assembly plant here, 1,000 miles from Detroit industy, red-clay Oklahoma, a land of oil wells and cattle andpickup trucks. Its 5,300 workers still do some welding byhand, and the factory has only 40 robots. But last year theplant made the midsize Pontiac 6000 the highest ranking BigThree model on a list of the 10 most trouble-free carscompiled by J.D. Power andamp; Associates.   The other factory, in Orion Township, Mich., is in theheart of Michigan's auto corridor, less than an hour's drivefrom GM headquarters. At that seven-year-old facility, 5,600workers and some 170 robots build Cadillac Fleetwoods andOldsmobile Ninety-Eights. On some days, the cars have morethan three times the company goal of two defects per car,according to GM's own measurements. None of Orion's cars madethe J.D. Power Top 10 list for 1991 models.   The contrast between the two plants shows the hugechallenge the world's largest car maker faces as it wrestlesto turn around its money-losing North American autooperations. In the late 1980s, GM suffered under a corporateMurphy's Law: It seemed almost as if everything that could gowrong did. Now, however, GM's quality and productivity areshowing marked improvement. Workers and executives, jolted bynet losses of $4.76 billion through the four quarters endedJune 30, recognize they must scrap old habits. In many cases,they are trying to apply Japanese-style productiontechniques.   But progress is coming at different paces in differentplaces. Much depends on whether local managers and workersare willing to cooperate, and attitudes vary widely.Labor-management cooperation is especially delicate in acompany that's shrinking. Since 1988, GM has closed or laidplans to close seven assembly plants, and analysts say italmost certainly must close three more of its remaining 28.   Some workers see this retreat as reason to improve fast --to save their jobs. Others react with bitterness. &quot;GM'sessential paradox is trying to elicit cooperation from itswork force while at the same time trying to shrink it,&quot; saysSean McAlinden, a labor expert at the University of Michigan.   Here's a look at how this conflict is playing out in twoof GM's U.S. plants:                                                                                                          Oklahoma City                                                                                                          When GM President Lloyd E. Reuss lists GM's best U.S.assembly plants, he invariably includes this 12-year-oldfactory on the southeast side of town.   The cars themselves aren't remarkable. The Pontiac 6000,Buick Century and Oldsmobile Cutlass Cieras are nine-year-oldrelics of GM's look-alike car fiasco of the mid-1980s.   What's different is that Oklahoma City's employees areradically changing how they work. They're putting an Americanface on a manufacturing system pioneered by Toyota MotorCorp. and other Japanese rivals. This system, known inside GMas &quot;synchronous manufacturing&quot; and also called &quot;leanproduction&quot; or the &quot;pull&quot; system, emphasizes doing more withless.   Jack Evans, the Oklahoma City plant manager, got a look atToyota's highly disciplined system in 1987, when he and someOklahoma City employees toured New United Motor ManufacturingInc., the GM-Toyota joint venture in Fremont, Calif., thatToyota manages. Now, it's Mr. Evans who gets visitors fromother GM factories.   One place he likes to show off is an open space deepinside the plant. Big enough for a basketball court andbleachers, the space used to be filled with thousands ofpieces of metal waiting to be welded into wheel wells. Butthey're all gone -- and the space they once filled symbolizesthe way Japanese &quot;just-in-time&quot; manufacturing can slashinventory costs.   Now, small batches of raw parts arrive at the start of thewelding line once an hour. The line's three work stations arelinked together by an overhead conveyor able to carry onlysix parts from one welding machine to another. When workersat the first station complete their part of the work on sixwheel wells, they wait for the next station to take them offthe conveyor before they make another six. There are nobackup supplies and nowhere to stack halffinished parts.   The way the plant has adopted the just-in-time system ofrunning on minimal inventories constitutes only part, albeitan important part, of the overall lean system that GM istrying to implement. This lean approach seeks to remove all&quot;safety nets&quot; -- including backup machines and backupquality-control workers -- because they often create wasteand delay remedies for underlying manufacturing problems.Lacking any parts in stock, for example, the workers must actfast when machines break down. They pull a cord that triggersa siren and a flashing light to alert repair workers.   Such changes may seem humdrum, but the gains in efficiencyare anything but. On the wheel-well line, each worker issaving up to 2.5 miles of steps a day. Overall, the factoryhas cut its inventory by 37% in four years and taken 20% offthe time needed to fill a dealer's order.   Oklahoma City's workers have directly benefited. ThePontiac 6000 is being phased out this fall, but itssurprising sixth-place showing in the J.D. Power survey ledto a barrage of orders for the nearly identical Buick Centuryand Oldsmobile Ciera also made here. As a result, OklahomaCity's hourly workers made a bundle on overtime last springdespite the recession. And speculation that the plant may beon the company's endangered list because of its age andlocation is starting to subside.   But &quot;we've still got a long way to go,&quot; says Mr. Evans,who was promoted last week to become manufacturing managerfor six GM assembly plants. The plant's productivity stilllags far behind that of Japanese-owned car plants in thiscountry. Toyota's Georgetown, Ky., factory built 20% morecars than Oklahoma City last year, with 42% fewer workers.   So Oklahoma City workers are still trying to improve.Their willingness to work together may be best exemplified bythe plant's training apparatus. On a given day, 50 to 100employees are in training for computers, mechanicalequipment, even high-school equivalency tests. Most of theclasses are taught by union instead of management personnel,unlike the practice at most GM facilities.   For Ed McCracken, an assembly-line worker and former unionofficial at the plant, the effort to improve boiled down to atable. When he started his current job of attachingpassenger-side mirrors not long ago, he told his bosses thetable where the mirrors are stacked was too low, and he hadto bend over, with some physical strain, 600 times a day. Heasked for a higher table and got one within days.   &quot;A while ago, this would have taken a year,&quot; the 12-yearemployee says. &quot;I'd have had to write a grievance and cuss mysupervisor out a few times.&quot;                                                                                                          Orion Township                                                                                                          At GM's Orion Township plant, however, fighting is stillin vogue. In June, the police charged an employee with armedassault after she allegedly attacked a supervisor with aknife and sent him to the hospital for 40 stitches. GMofficials call the incident a &quot;lovers' quarrel.&quot; Earlier thisyear, a brawl at the plant ended after one worker whackedanother with a power gun. &quot;There's always something going onout there,&quot; says Michael McCabe, a detective in the sheriff'sdepartment.   Such incidents are just one of Orion's problems. A recentinternal quality audit found defects in 88 of 100 carsspot-checked, workers say. A company-wide audit showed theplant's overall quality rank down to 22nd among 28 GM plantsfrom 18th a year earlier.   The $1.2 billion facility has been troubled ever since GMbuilt it in the early 1980s. Then, GM believed that robotscould solve its labor problems. The company has retreatedfrom that strategy, but the workers remain distrustful. &quot;Wehave to be very wary of our GM counterparts,&quot; says ErnieEmery, president of the United Auto Workers local thatrepresents most of the plant's 5,600 workers. And MarvinWightman, the local's chairman, comments, &quot;What is quality? Imean, I have a hard time getting my arms around it.&quot;   Mr. Wightman, who is allied with a UAW faction thatopposes cooperation, could start with the daily two-pagereport in which factory managers summarize the previous day'sproduction and quality results. But he doesn't. &quot;I never readit,&quot; he says. &quot;I guess I should, but I don't.&quot;   The contrast between the work forces at Orion and OklahomaCity largely stems from their initial composition. Orion'sworkers were assembled from more than two dozen GM plants inMichigan; it's even called a &quot;mongrel local&quot; in UAW parlance.Many Orion workers suffered long, painful layoffs in theearly 1980s, when GM closed or consolidated many partsfactories, and they were moved to Orion because of theirseniority. But they arrived resentful and bitter -- andconvinced that GM wouldn't close this brand-new facility nomatter what they did.   The Oklahoma City factory, by contrast, hired most of itsworkers locally. And they get substantially higher wages thando most such workers in the state, plus generousUAW-negotiated benefits.   At Orion, labor and management have made some efforts toimprove the plant. They are close to agreeing to install aJapanese-style system to allow workers to stop the assemblyline when a problem arises. That's hardly a revolutionaryconcept, but it would be a big help at Orion because theplant now fixes most mistakes only after the cars areallegedly finished. At times, according to an internalreport, as many as 600 cars are sitting in the plant's repairshop -- more than the factory produces in an eight-hourshift.   Earlier this year, Orion tried to start in its body shop alean-production system similar to Oklahoma City's. But, atOrion, it resulted in lengthy stoppages of much of thebody-shop assembly line, workers say. To meet productiongoals, Orion managers gave up on the program.   Even when Orion managers and union leaders reach anagreement, it doesn't work very well. Some 500UAW-represented skilled trades workers -- mechanics,electricians and pipefitters -- rejected a tentativeagreement on a three-year labor pact negotiated earlier thisyear. Company and union officials are bargaining on a newagreement, and the skilled tradesmen continue to work under afour-year-old pact that was to expire last September.   Oddly enough, Orion workers have a sort of &quot;teamwork&quot;local labor agreement, specifying only about a dozen jobclassifications; Oklahoma City has a more traditionalcontract and three times as many kinds of jobs. But eventhough the additional job classifications at Oklahoma Cityand the attendant work rules drag down productivity belowthat in Japanese factories, its workers outperform Orion's;willing to get the job done, they find ways to cooperatedespite all the classifications.   GM officials say they still want to make Orion a leanoperation. But they concede that it is lagging. &quot;Some plantsare easier than others,&quot; says J.T. Battenberg III, the GMvice president who oversees the car-building group thatincludes Orion.   Trying to get Orion up to speed, GM keeps changing themanagement; the plant has had four plant managers in itsseven years, compared with only one at Oklahoma City duringthe same period. But all the switching seems to havebackfired: It has reduced union officials' confidence in themanagement's stability. Why try to develop a workingrelationship with a manager, they wonder, when he will soonhead out the revolving door?   Many employees may not be working at Orion very long,either. The factory could lose half its jobs next year whenCadillac production moves to a plant in Detroit. TimSprecher, the newly installed plant manager, declines tocomment. But recently, he got on the plant's closed-circuittelevision system and warned that if the workers didn't shapeup, the plant could be one of those GM shuts down.</TEXT></DOC>
