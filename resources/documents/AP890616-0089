The governor, David Wilson, spoke with reporters after returningfrom an international conference on boat people in Geneva. There,the United States, the Soviet Union and Vietnam opposed calls forforced repatriation of boat people who are not considered refugees.   Britain and Hong Kong support the repatriation.   Hong Kong is swamped with about 30,000 boat people. Thegovernment says many are not refugees fleeing political persecutionbut illegal immigrants seeking better economic conditions.   Wilson said there are many countries that ``simply will not facefacts.'' He said such countries agree there's no question ofresettling in third countries people who are not refugees, but atthe same time they oppose forcing such people back to Vietnam.   ``To my mind that is illogical, and indeed I think it is inhumanebecause what it is saying is that those people should simply pile upin camps around the region,'' Wilson said.   The head of the relief agency Oxfam Hong Kong, Chris Bale, saidtoday there is no alternative to forced repatriation because theVietnamese ``really do not want to go back.''   Those who are not refugees should be returned just as illegalimmigrants from any other country are returned, he said. He saidmany Vietnamese were suffering psychological problems from beingconfined in the camps for years.   Starting in June 1988, Hong Kong tried to curb the influx by ascreening the Vietnamese and separating refugees, who are eligiblefor resettlement in the West, from other groups who are supposed toreturn home. Only 143 Vietnamese have gone back voluntarily eventhough the United Nations gives financial aid for people to return.   The 60-nation conference in Geneva adopted a plan introducinguniversal screening programs. The plan called for encouragingvoluntary return and said if this did not succeed, alternativeswould be examined.   Local police in Tokyo today said 105 people found on a woodenboat near a southwestern Japanese island were all Vietnamese wholeft home in search of a place where they could ``enjoy a higherstandard of living.''   The police official, who requested anonymity, said a localVietnamese woman confirmed the Vietnamese came from Hon Gai, a smallvillage along the Gulf of Tonkin, near the boarder of Vietnam andChina.   A local fisherman spotted the old wooden boat near Hazama Port,610 miles southwest of Tokyo, early today.   If the Immigration Office grants the group refugee status, theywill be allowed a 180-day stay in Japan until their finaldestination is determined. That stay can be extended until apermanent residence is found through the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees in Tokyo.</TEXT></DOC>
