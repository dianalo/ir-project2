She was quoted by the China Daily newspaper.   ``The population increase will gobble up all the economic gainseach year unless it is put under strict control,'' the Xinhua newsagency quoted Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong as saying.   China will have 1.1 billion people by April, Ms. Peng told themeeting.   She did not announce the birth rate for 1988, but disclosed that1987's rate was 2.3 percent, higher than the 2 percent previouslyannounced for the year.   The recent barrage of official lectures on family planning mayindicate that last year's rate was higher still. The official goalis 1.5 percent growth or lower.   To achieve that goal, since the early 1980s the government haslimited most families to only one child. But in the past few yearsmore and more families have ignored the limit, and the state alsohas seemed to relax the policy.   Last year, it said rural couples whose first child was a girlwould be allowed to have a second to try for a son to work on theland.   However, the combination of soaring population and stagnant grainharvests has heightened anxiety among officials.   Chen said the rapid growth rate means per capita grain supplieswill remain about even even if overall grain production is increased25 percent to 1.1 trillion pounds by the year 2000.   However, a decline in per capital grain supplies seems likelybecause agriculture officials recently said it will be virtuallyimpossible to reach that goal by 2000.   Population projections for 2000 are going higher and higher. Thetarget is 1.2 billion, but family planning authorities said lastyear it more likely would reach 1.27 or 1.28 billion.   The Economic Daily predicted Tuesday that it would hit 1.32billion if it continues growing at its current pace.   Enforcement of the general one-child policy varies widely fromone area to another. Cities are the most strict, with most workersfacing fines and possible dismissal if they have a second child.   But in some rural areas, farmers have become prosperous enough tobe able to afford the fines.</TEXT></DOC>
