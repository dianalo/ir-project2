The agreement, signed by Customs Commissioner William von Raaband AID Administrator Alan Woods, establishes a permanent programallowing the transfer of seized textile merchandise forhumanitarian distribution.   ``This is a true case of government triumphing over its ownbureaucracy,'' said von Raab, noting that ``it benefits more thanthe egos of government officials. Someone will actually benefitfrom this.''   Previously, Customs had no recourse but to spend ``hundreds ofthousands of taxpayers' dollars to destroy this clothing,'' vonRaab said.   A major shipment of clothing was seized after the People'sRepublic of China alerted Customs that counterfeit documents werebeing used to bring the items into the country.   The clothing includes cotton jeans, shirts, dresses, denimjackets and infants' cotton shirts manufactured in China.   AID will turn the clothing over to World Vision ReliefOrganization and the Adventist Development and Relief Agency fordistribution in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, where it isexpected to clothe 20,000 children.</TEXT></DOC>
