The mouse experiment suggested that it may be possible toinject a missing gene directly into the deteriorating musclesof a child with muscular dystrophy, thereby restoring themuscles' normal structure. The experiment is the latest ofseveral advances against muscular dystrophy, an ultimatelyfatal disorder that afflicts one of every 3,500 boys born.About 250,000 Americans have the disorder, which is familiarto most Americans through the annual Labor Day Jerry LewisTelethon of the Muscular Dystrophy Association.</LP><TEXT>   The research advances are coming in the wake of thediscovery five years ago of the genetic defect that causesthe disorder. The discovery, ending a century of bafflementover the cause of muscular dystrophy, showed that in the mostcommon form, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the defective genefails to make a protein that supports the structure of amuscle cell. In a milder form of the disease, Becker musculardystrophy, the genetic defect produces a faulty version ofthe protein.   The missing or defective protein was dubbed dystrophin.The discovery of dystrophin, in turn, has led to an intensiveeffort to find ways of restore dystrophin production to themuscles of affected boys. In the first experimental attempts,several research teams are transplanting normal muscle cellsinto the leg muscles of affected boys in hopes the normalcells will &quot;take&quot; and begin supplying the missing dystrophin.   The new mouse experiment suggests another route torestoring dystrophin production to the afflicted muscles thatavoids the problem of the body rejecting transplanted musclecells.   Researchers at the University of Wisconsin in Madisonreported that they had taken synthetic versions of the normaldystrophin gene, supplied by British scientists, and injectedthe genes directly into the leg and heart muscles of youngmice. The inbred laboratory mice have a genetic defect thatprevents their muscles from making dystrophin, making therodents ideal research animals for muscular dystrophy.   A week after the gene injections the researchers founddystrophin present in about 1% of the treated muscle fibers,indicating the injected normal genes had begun to function,Jon A. Wolff, director of biochemical genetics, and hiscolleagues reported in this week's issue of the Britishscientific journal, Nature.   The experiment indicated that gene therapy for musculardystrophin may be simpler than once thought. Heretofore, itwas believed that a virus would have to be geneticallyengineered to carry a new gene into a cell. But in theWisconsin experiments the gene alone managed to get into thecell and function.   The proportion of muscle fibers that took up the injectedgene, however, was far too small for the technique to beuseful in patients without further development, thescientists cautioned.</TEXT></DOC>
