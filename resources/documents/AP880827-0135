GANS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police searched Saturday for an inmate wanted onmurder charges who escaped from jail using a ``John Dillingerspecial'' _ a fake gun carved from a bar of soap that fooled aguard.   Victor Thomas, 27, told Cook County Jail officials that he wasill and wanted to go to Cermak Memorial Hospital, which isconnected to the jail by a tunnel, said Robert Glotz, assistantdirector of the county corrections department.   In the basement of the hospital, the inmate pulled out a weaponmade of soap and threatened the unarmed guard escorting him, Glotzsaid.   Thomas tied up the guard, then took his uniform, badge andwallet and walked out of the jail complex Friday, he said.   ``People here are saying he got out using the John Dillingerspecial,'' said an officer in the Cook County sheriff's department,who spoke Saturday by telephone on condition of anonymity. ``Thereare many ways out and he used the oldest ruse _ the phony gunroutine _ and it worked.''   ``It was quite a work of art,'' said the officer, describing thesoap-bar gun. ``It was black with some light blue highlighting _probably made with a marker pen _ it was approximately the size of.25-caliber automatic pistol with a delicately carved barrel,grooves and a trigger guard.''   According to legend, Dillinger escaped from a jail in CrownPoint, Ind., in 1934 after brandishing a fake gun that he carvedout of wood. The legend lives though it later was revealedDillinger accomplished the escape with a real .45-caliber automatic.   Glotz said Thomas had been in jail for a year on three armedrobbery charges. His soap gun was recovered a block from the jail.   Thomas was in jail on three counts of armed robbery, policesaid. He also is wanted in California for the March 3, 1987,slaying of three alleged drug dealers who were strangled or stabbedto death in the Los Angeles area, police said.   About 40 officers were looking for Thomas on Saturday,interviewing acquaintances and checking areas Thomas has been knownto frequent, said police Sgt. Tom Whalen.   According to the ``Encyclopedia of American Crime,'' the storythat Dillinger used a wooden gun to escape was a hoax to cover upthe fact that the real gun had been smuggled into the jail by anIndiana judge bribed by Dillinger's lawyer.</TEXT></DOC>
