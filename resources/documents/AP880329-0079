Rifkin, whose campaign against genetic engineering has delayedsome field tests of the organisms, says the proposed biologicalpesticide will cause a decline in corn yields.   The decline, he claims, is an adverse environmental effect andreason to deny the developer, Crop Genetics Inc. of Dorsey, Md.,permission to run field tests.   The company says its planned product is unique among biologicaland genetically engineered pesticides in that it aims to``vaccinate'' the plant against attack by the target pest _ thecorn borer, a kind of caterpillar. It works inside the plant'svascular system, and does not change the plant or the pestgenetically.   For that reason, the company calls it the ``InCide'' technique.   In a sign of the increasing importance of genetic engineeringtechniques in farming, the Agriculture Department said Monday itwould license SyntroVet, Inc. of Lenexa, Kan., to market thenation's third genetically engineered vaccine to controlpseudorabies in swine, a contagious disease that can be deadly tonewborn pigs but does not affect humans.   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal andPlant Health Inspection Service, said safety and effectiveness hadbeen shown in field trials on 400 animals in three states, andthere is ``no significant impact on the human environment.''   When Crop Genetics told reporters last week that its organismcauses no significant change in yields, ``They lied ... and you canquote me,'' Rifkin said.   The company's chief scientist, Peter Carlson, was asked aboutRifkin's assertion and statements in support of it. Carlson saidRifkin did not quote the relevant sections of the company'sapplication for testing permits.   Some tests using the carrier organism without the pesticide haveshown crop declines, notably of 17 percent in Florida test plots,but the ``usual statistical tests that scientists use show there isnot a significant difference'' from untreated corn, Carlson said.   And even if there is a decline, the company insists that's notan environmental effect or a reason to deny permits. ``If we causea significant decline in yields, no farmer is going to buy ourproduct,'' Carlson said. ``Rifkin is grabbing at any argument hecan.''   It may well be true that corn will show a small decline inyields, he said. But a farmer might accept that if he could achievea large decline in costs.   The corn borer causes $400 million in crop damage, even afterfarmers spend about $50 million on chemical pesticides, the companysaid. The borer can reduce yields 20 percent in some corn beltareas.   The company's technique uses a harmless bacterium to carry thetoxin that kills the borer. Carlson has selected one that's foundnormally only in Bermuda grass _ Clavibacter xyli, subspeciescynodontis, or Cxc. Cows have been eating it for centuries.   The toxin is produced by a gene in another bacterium. That gene,using the techniques of recombinant DNA, is inserted into Cxc. Themodified Cxc is injected into the seed and will exist in the cornplant's vascular system, its new gene directing the manufacture ofthe protein toxin in the cell.   When the borer eats the corn leaf or stem tissue, it alsogobbles the toxin.   If the Environmental Protection Agency and the AgricultureDepartment's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service approve,the company hopes to run field tests in Queen Anne's County,Maryland and at the department's Beltsville, Md. research stationthis year. It also has applied to test in France.   The company has asked that EPA waive some suggested toxicitytests, tests it says are not necessary in the light of results fromother tests. Rifkin is attacking the application on this groundstoo, arguing that all the tests should be performed.   In its campaign for public understanding and acceptance of thefield experiments, Crop Genetics has lined up heavyweights on anadvisory board that include two former administrators of theEnvironmental Protection Agency, William Ruckelshaus and DouglasCostle, and Elliot L. Richardson, a former attorney general andsecretary of several Cabinet agencies.</TEXT></DOC>
