The suit, filed Tuesday by shareholder Lionel Brazen in CookCounty Circuit Court here, asked the court to grant a temporaryinjunction to compel the parent of United Airlines ``to bargain ingood faith with all interested acquirers and auction UAL to thehighest possible bidder.''   The lawsuit _ which seeks certification as a class action _ wasfiled as UAL reportedly was being courted by a number of suitorsbesides Davis, whose original offer several weeks ago touched off arecord-breaking climb in UAL stock.   Davis' bid was sweetened last Wednesday to $6.19 billion, or $275a share.   The complaint alleged that ``while refusing to publicly take aposition on the Davis proposal, UAL and its directors are activelyengaged in seeking out other potential bidders for UAL.''   The suit also cited a Wall Street Journal report that UAL mightbe favoring British Airways PLC as a potential acquirer, saying suchtalks would constitute ``an admission by UAL and its directors thatthe company is for sale.''   UAL spokesman Rob Doughty denied a decision to sell the companyhad in fact been made, repeating what UAL directors said after twoboard meetings last week, ``that it was premature to say that adecision has been reached on whether a sale of the company isappropriate.''   The Journal reported today that UAL was likely to wait forfinancing details of Davis' financing bid before deciding what to do.   UAL shares slipped $1.75 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchangeto close at $272.   Besides British Airways, said to be working in tandem with MorganStanley andamp; Co., other reported bidders for UAL are leveraged buyoutspecialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. and a management-led groupheaded by UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf.   United and representatives of those firms have declined comment,citing policies regarding speculative reports.   Some potential acquirers also reportedly met with union officialsrepresenting United's pilots and machinists, who are consideredcrucial to any sale or restructuring of the airline and might seekan equity stake in return for their cooperation.   Union officials also have declined to comment on matters relatedto an acquisition of the company.   The lawsuit, without specifying any potential suitor, asks thecourt to order UAL directors to ``bargain in good faith with allinterested acquirers and to auction UAL to the highest possiblebidders.''</TEXT></DOC>
