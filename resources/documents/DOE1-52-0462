Together, the Old and New Rifle sites cover 164 acres of privateland and contain approximately 3.5 million cubic yards of tailings andassociated contaminated soils. The tailings were produced by the UnionCarbide Corporation when it processed vanadium and uranium ores from1924 to 1932 and from 1942 to 1973. If the the tailings are properlystabilized, erosion or human removal of the contaminated materials cannotspread the contamination over a much wider area and increase potentialpublic health hazards. Approximately 164 acres of land would be releasedfor other uses. Primary impacts of the preferred alternative would bethe temporary exceeding of federal and state air quality standards; disturbanceof residents-near and between the Rifle, Estes Gulch, and borrow sitesduring the daytime from noise generated by construction and transportationactivities; and increased traffic on US Highway 6 and State Highway 13,with associated increases in accidents, congestion, and highway maintenance.</TEXT></DOC>
