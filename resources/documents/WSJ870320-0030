Gen. Richard Secord to turn over private bank records related to the Iran-Contra affair.    The resolution was approved on a voice vote without debate, and Michael Davidson, the Senate legal counsel, said he will file a motion in federal court next week. If the Senate is successful, Gen. Secord risks being held in contempt of court until he turns over the records sought by the Senate committee investigating the scandal.    The resolution was initiated solely by the Senate. But as a practical matter, it is part of a joint effort with the House to secure Swiss bank records. Those records are needed to understand transactions behind U.S. weapon shipments to Iran as well as covert arms shipments and money funneled to Nicaraguan insurgents.    Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel investigating the Iran-Contra affair, also has been frustrated in securing the documents; even if he is successful, he has told investigators he won't share the information with Congress because of commitments to Swiss authorities.    A third alternative being pursued by the committees investigating the scandal is to grant immunity to Gen. Secord's business associate, Albert Hakim. Mr. Hakim is believed to have access to the same records and prepared to provide the most critical financial information before congressional hearings begin in May. </TEXT></DOC>
