How, they asked plaintively after every escalatingleveraged buy-out, after every spurt in CEO salary levels,could so many chief executives, investment bankers andlawyers pile up so much money at the expense of so many jobs?Who allowed so many mindless buyouts and mergers to goforward?   The slumbering watchdogs, of course, were the outsidedirectors of America. Now, Richard M. Clurman's revealing newbook about the 1989 merging of Time Inc. and WarnerCommunications Inc., &quot;To the End of Time: The Seduction andConquest of a Media Empire&quot; (Simon andamp; Schuster, 368 pages,$23), offers a particularly vivid illustration of boardmembers at their most supine. Mr. Clurman, who spent 20 yearsas a journalist and executive at Time, describes in unfussyprose the lighthearted way in which the reins of grand oldTime Inc. were tossed to Warner's glitzy chairman, Steven J.Ross.</LP><TEXT>   Though Mr. Ross's past was chockablock with variousinvestigations and SEC inquiries, the Time board, as Mr.Clurman shows, never stirred itself to launch a formalinquiry. Now, Mr. Ross may in truth be the cleanest, mostcharming fellow in Rockefeller Center. But as Mr. Clurmanmakes clear, key Time executives and board members seemed togo out of their way to avoid bringing up his past and therebyrisk killing the deal. To them, it was manna from heavenraining down on Time terrain that was parched after severalbungled projects and failed startups.   Only two Time directors, Michael D. Dingman and Henry C.Goodrich, took their fiduciary responsibilities seriouslyenough to actually meet Mr. Ross. &quot;I don't understand theprotocol about how such major corporate events areconducted,&quot; explained one inside director, Time magazine'seditor in chief, Jason McManus, whom Mr. Clurman portrays asquite out of his depth in the Wall Street shark pool. &quot;I canimagine like a Bulgarian wedding you don't even see the bridebeforehand.&quot;   None of the Time directors, Mr. Clurman shows, pressed toknow more about any of the controversies that had dogged Mr.Ross, most notably the investigations into gangland'sinfamous Westchester Premier Theatre, which had led to thecriminal conviction of two of Mr. Ross's aides and hadresulted in Mr. Ross himself being named an unindictedco-conspirator. Some on Time's board, such as Edward S.Finkelstein, the chief executive officer at R.H. Macy, seemedto think it would have been rude to inquire. &quot;Why dig allthat up -- unless you were against (the merger) and wanted toscrew up the deal,&quot; Mr. Finkelstein wondered.   Others pleaded ignorance, even after the deal wascompleted. John R. Opel, the former IBM chairman whose formercorporate headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., were barely sevenmiles from the failed theater, testified under oath that hewasn't even aware of the notorious scandal, much less of Mr.Ross's involvement in it.   Meanwhile, Time executives who had their prestige -- notto mention multimillion-dollar gains in Time stock andbonuses -- riding on the deal, did little to encourage anyinitiative on the board's part. Time President Nicholas J.Nicholas, who joined Mr. Ross as the combined TimeWarner'sco-CEO, recalled his own performance on the Xerox board runby his pal David T. Kearns. &quot;Whatever (Mr. Kearns) said, I'dtake his word for it,&quot; Mr. Nicholas said. Time directors,&quot;trusted our judgment,&quot; he explained in happier times, beforeMr. Ross elbowed him out a few weeks ago.   Such trust, as former Time CEO Richard J. Munro makesclear in an embarrassing admission, wasn't a smart idea. Atfirst Mr. Munro says he told directors &quot;we made a hundredphone calls, checked (Mr. Ross) seventeen ways from Sunday.&quot;In fact, when Mr. Munro's memory was jogged by Mr. Clurman,he admitted to only &quot;a handful&quot; of calls, mostly to othermembers of the chief executive fraternity, men practicallyguaranteed not to badmouth each other for fear of a backlashfrom brother CEOs on their own boards. Time's idea of duediligence was checking out Mr. Ross with his own lawyer, theubiquitous Arthur Liman.   Poor Mr. Munro. As Mr. Clurman describes it, the formerchairman endured &quot;punishing stress&quot; that culminated in hiscalling on an old friend to comment at a meeting of Timeexecutives. After a moment of stunned silence, colleagues hadto remind Mr. Munro that he had delivered the eulogy at theman's funeral a year before.   Charmed nearly out of their socks by the immenselypersonable Mr. Ross, Time directors glowered when Paramount'sMartin Davis stepped in to challenge their merger plans witha surprise tender offer, Mr. Clurman says. They hired adetective firm to check him out and then went to a Delawarecourt to block the bid.   The jury is still out on whether the Time Warnercombination makes business sense. It is yet much too early tosay. But the time is ripe for judging the record of the oldTime board. &quot;Directors,&quot; said Arthur Temple, a feisty Texanwho was one of the few Time board members to oppose theWarner deal, &quot;are a bunch of wimps.&quot;   ---   Mr. Burrough, a Journal reporter, is author of theforthcoming &quot;Vendetta: American Express and the Smearing ofEdmond Safra.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
