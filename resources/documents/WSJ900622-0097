Squeezing them on one side are casual restaurants thatappeal to aging baby boomers who are losing their appetitefor burgers and fries on the run. These diners are opting forrestaurants that offer a healthier menu, table service and amore relaxed atmosphere -- at prices not much different fromMcDonald's.</LP><TEXT>   On the other side are the super-discounters, such asMexican chains and no-frills hamburger outlets that offerdrive-through service only. These chains are drawingbargain-hungry fast-food customers who have little brandloyalty. Low prices and speedy service are their maindemands, with less concern about food quality.   To maintain customer counts, the big fast-food chains arecutting prices where necessary while trying to keep up theirservice standards. At the same time, they're expanding theirmenus to compete with the casual dining establishments. It'sa tricky juggling act.   Long a ho-hum segment of the $150 billion-a-yearrestaurant business, midpriced restaurants too oftensymbolized nonchalant waitresses and forgettable food. Todaythey boast nutritious-sounding menus and staffs that stressservice.   As a result, many are experiencing sales gains unseenelsewhere in the industry. National Restaurant Associationfigures show casual dining traffic climbing 8.4% last yearcompared with the 1.2% level eked out by quick-serviceoperators and a 1.4% rise overall.   Typical of the revival is Perkins Family Restaurants, oncea &quot;cake `n' steak&quot; outfit heavy on pancake breakfasts andchopped beef dinners. Its something-for-everyone menu nowfeatures sandwiches and salads. Many of its 382 outlets havebakeries on the premises. Senior citizens can ordersmall-portion meals at cheaper prices. Kids can eat for$1.99. And although the restaurants are selling comfort overspeed, they promise free food if lunch isn't served within 10minutes.   &quot;We want to attract the person graduating out of fastfood,&quot; says Perkins Chairman Donald N. Smith, himself analumnus of both Burger King and McDonald's, where he helpeddevelop McBreakfast. Perkins is a unit of TennesseeRestaurant Co., Itasca, Ill.   The average Perkins check runs $4.70 per person. That ishigher than the McDonald's-type tab, but the gap isshrinking. Since 1986, McDonald's prices have outpaced thegovernment's Consumer Price Index. Meanwhile, food costs havedeclined in recent years; they represented 40% of McDonald'scompany-operated outlets' overhead in 1979, but only 34% in1989.   &quot;It means that the customer is getting less food for eachdollar spent,&quot; says Michael Mueller, a restaurant analyst forSan Francisco-based Montgomery Securities. Ticking off anumber of casual dining chains, he says: &quot;You can eat atChili's or Denny's or Shoney's for slightly higher pricesthan McDonald's -- and in some cases a lower price.&quot;   &quot;Our commitment is to value pricing,&quot; a McDonald'sspokesman says, contending that covers speed and accuracy ofservice as well as the food. But in broadening the menu fromthe original burger, fries and Coke, &quot;it's probablyinevitable that pricing of large sandwiches or entree itemsmove in the direction of the {sit-down} restaurants.&quot;   By its own count, McDonald's feeds 22 million people aday, but Barbara Sekowski isn't one of them. &quot;You think youcan take the kids and eat cheaply and you can't anymore. I'drather pack my son a sandwich,&quot; says the 33-year-old suburbanChicago sales representative who shuns fast-food outlets.   Dinner-house operators think they have a good chance ofserving people like Ms. Sekowski, whose generation was weanedon fast food and now, as it approaches middle age, representsa growing demographic segment. Ten years ago, 14% of the U.S.population was between the ages of 30 and 39. Today thatfigure is 16.5%. By contrast, the 15- to 29-year-olds -- theprimary fast-food target -- have shrunk a full five points,to 22.5%.   The graying of America is likely to favor the casualdinner house. &quot;Senior citizens, by virtue of their increasedpurchasing power, will have more say in menu offerings andservice,&quot; says Leslie Steppel, who follows the trade forPrudential-Bache Securities Inc.   She notes that older people often regard eating out as asocial occasion, and thus are unlikely to meet at a fast-foodrestaurant. Still, the chains are trying to bring them in.Some Florida McDonald's outlets offer Senior Citizen Bingoduring slow morning hours. And the McDonald's spokesman saysthe company is experimenting with what he terms &quot;a moresophisticated dinner ambiance&quot; at some outlets as it seeks towoo evening-hours patrons.   In part to broaden their appeal to customers who mightotherwise choose a midpriced restaurant, fast-foodrestaurants are offering extensive menu choices. For example,the McDonald's in Chicago's Northwestern train station foodcourt sells seven sandwiches, four salads, two soups, 13beverages and eight desserts. The desserts include four typesof cookies, two of which are fresh-baked. Serving-sizealternatives balloon the options. Besides three sizes ofFrench fries and Chicken McNuggets orders, various cups makefor 30 drink possibilities.   Nutritional concerns are also contributing to heftiermenus. McDonald's recently added yogurt, cold cereals and anapple-bran muffin. It also is working on a grilled chickensandwich to rival a popular Burger King item.   But by offering such an array, fast-food operators areexperiencing service slowdowns at peak hours. More selectionsmean a greater burden on the preparation crew. And indecisivecustomers can slow down the lines.   That wide selection, though, may not have much appeal toanother group of customers. &quot;Price is more important to aheavy fast-food user,&quot; says Bob Sandelman, whose Sandelman andamp;Associates research firm tracks the West Coast quick-servicescene. Speed is nearly as important as price, while foodquality is less so, he says.   In fact, many drive-through customers seem to buy lunchmuch the way they do gasoline; location and price are thecriteria. &quot;They look at it more as a fuel stop than a diningexperience,&quot; says Mr. Sandelman. Heavy users tend to beyoung, single males.   PepsiCo Inc. has been able to cash in big on the bargainhunters. Its Mexican chain, Taco Bell, boosted sales 27% andearnings 45% last year, and Wall Street is expecting gainsagain this year, largely from the chain's 59-cent entrees.   Wendy's International Inc. is fighting to retain businessby offering low-prices on a &quot;super value menu.&quot; McDonald'sresists discounting, seeking to use it only as a local-markettactic. Nonetheless, it has become increasingly necessary. Acompany executive says discounting could account for nearly18% of McDonald's sales again this year, slightly below theindustry average.   Mr. Mueller, the Montgomery analyst, suggests thatMcDonald's offer &quot;everyday low prices&quot; as retailing giantSears does. &quot;That convinces people you're not overpriced onevery item,&quot; he says.   Perhaps fittingly, as McDonald's domestic business slows,the Oak Brook, Ill., behemoth is increasingly investing innew restaurants overseas. Not only is American fast foodstill a fad in many countries and dining out a specialoccasion, but meals often cost substantially more.   That means McDonald's can realize a fatter return abroad,where growth potential is tremendous. In the U.S., McDonald'shas 8,400 restaurants serving a population of 250 million.But in Japan, a country of 140 million, there are only 700Golden Arches.   ---             Changing tastes in restaurant food                                                                                                                                (1984-1989)                                                                                                                                                       Percentage    Menu                                         Change in                                                                                                           Egg dishes                                   - 35%    Meat (beef, pork, lamb)                      - 15    Pasta                                        + 92    Poultry                                      + 16    Salads                                       + 57   ---                 Changes in cooking methods                                                                                                                                (1984-1989)                                                                                                                                                   Rank                                      ---------------    Method                            1984       1989                                                                                                           Frying                              1          3    Broil/charbroil                     2          1    Saute                               3          4    Grill/mesquite                      4          2    Roast                               4          6    Bake                                5          5    Steam                               6          8    Barbecue                            7          9</TEXT></DOC>
