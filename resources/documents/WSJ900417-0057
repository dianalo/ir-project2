So what does Congress do?   The House agriculture subcommittees are in a feedingfrenzy to see who can bust the budget the most. They've sofar raised the projected five-year cost of the pending farmbill by $42 billion over President Bush's request, up to atotal of $180 billion.</LP><TEXT>   That's bad enough, but history teaches that projectedcosts of these five-year plans never add up quite right. In1981, the Agriculture Department said the farm bill wouldcost $12 billion over four years. It cost $60 billion. In1985, Agriculture said the current farm bill would cost $52billion over five years. It has cost $110 billion -- so far.   One reason the farm lobby can make such massive raids onthe Treasury is that few people realize the full costs.Farmers tell us that if people knew by how much farmsubsidies raise prices, there would be uprisings atsupermarket checkout lines. Another reason there is no revoltis that most Americans have come to more or less acceptseveral myths propounded by the farm lobby:                                                                                                          Without subsidies, the family farm would disappear.                                                                                                          Current subsidy programs compel farmers to increase theiryields rather than control costs. This gives an advantage tolarge, wealthy farmers who can afford the huge combines thatallow them to outproduce small farmers. Dennis Avery, aformer government agriculture analyst, says, &quot;Farm programshave led to an overcapitalization of agriculture with lessactual employment than what it would otherwise have.&quot; As itis, the big growth in farm employment is at the AgricultureDepartment, which now has one bureaucrat for every sixfull-time farmers.   Farm programs are designed to help the family farmer.                                                                                                          In fact, most subsidies flow to large corporate farms orpart-time &quot;gentleman&quot; farmers. The USDA counts anyone whosells more than $1,000 in commodities in a year as a farmer.The number of full-time farmers has gone up since 1980, andtheir average net worth is now more than $1 million. Since1985, the USDA has spent more than $1 million on eachfull-time rice and sugar grower.                                                                                                          Subsidies are available to most farmers, and areuniversally supported by those who receive them.                                                                                                          Farm subsidies help only selected growers. Almost half ofU.S. farmers produce meat, vegetables or specialty crops thatreceive no federal price supports. The bankruptcy rate ofthese farmers is below that of farmers who receive federalhelp.   Farm programs are now so generous that even the mostself-reliant farmers have become yoked to them. A 1988 pollin Iowa found more than one out of four farmers who receivedsubsidies were in favor of ending all support programs withinfive years. GOP Rep. Dick Armey and Democratic Rep. CharlesSchumer have a plan to weed out wealthy recipients of farmsubsidies. They would stop payments of any kind to farmerswho earn $100,000 or more a year. Shifting farm programs fromprice supports to welfare payments aimed at needy farmerscould cut the cost of farm subsidies by two-thirds.   So far, this sensible idea is going nowhere in Congress.We note that several well-off Members of Congress themselvesreceive federal farm subsidies. Since 1984, Rep. CharlesStenholm (D., Texas) has collected between $5,000 and $15,000a year for producing cotton for which he helped legislatesubsidies on the Cotton, Rice and Sugar Subcommittee. Ifexecutive-branch employees netted such a windfall they wouldface immediate investigation by a special prosecutor.Congress has exempted itself from the conflict-of-interestprovisions of the Ethics in Government Act.   The subsidy lobby's basic calculation is that PresidentBush would't dare veto a farm bill, no matter how expensive,if it's passed just before the November elections. The bestbet for containing the subsidies may be the next round oftalks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, due toend in December. Negotiators hope to agree on a world-widereduction of farm subsidies, and presumably Congress wouldhave to write a cheaper farm bill.   As of now, though, Members of Congress seem bent oncontinuing their annual farm pig-out, all the while screamingat the President and the electorate for not raising taxes.</TEXT></DOC>
