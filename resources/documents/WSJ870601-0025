Wall Street's latest brainstorm for boosting stock prices is causing an extra round of jitters for Ms. Patel and other bond investors. Such companies as Allegis and Caesars World have decided that the best way to fight off unsolicited takeover overtures is to undergo what is euphemistically known as a &quot;recapitalization.&quot;    In these transactions, companies shrink their equity and boost debt, often by paying a huge one-time dividend to stockholders. Last week, Allegis, for example, said it would borrow $3 billion to pay a $60-a-share dividend to shareholders. That sent Allegis's stock price soaring more than 15 points on the week, with it closing at 86 1/2 Friday. Analysts figured that the maneuver also increased the obstacles to a possible takeover bid by Coniston Partners, which had acquired 13% of Allegis, the holding company for United Airlines, Hertz Rent-a-Car and other operations.    However, Friday &quot;wasn't a good day for bondholders,&quot; said a fixed-income analyst at a major Wall Street firm. Prices for bonds and notes of Allegis's operating units fell steeply, ending the week down about $40 for each $1,000 face amount, compared with the week before. What's more, &quot;there had already been some erosion of the bond prices even before the (recapitalization) announcement,&quot; the analyst said.    Credit rating agencies chimed in with concern about Allegis's debt securities. Moody's said it was reviewing Allegis's double-B rating on senior unsecured debt, and United Airlines's triple-B rating for senior secured debt, &quot;for possible downgrade.&quot; Standard andamp; Poor's, in turn, placed Allegis debt securities on its CreditWatch list, with negative implications.    Bondholders' concern, of course, is that companies may jeopardize their balance sheets in such recapitalizations. That could hurt the company's ability to pay debt, if the economy or other conditions worsen. And as recapitalizations, leveraged buyouts and debt-funded takeovers become ever more common, &quot;This sort of risk (to bondholders) has overwhelmed the usual credit risk analysis,&quot; says Richard Fischer, a partner in the New York bond-management firm of Fischer, Francis, Trees andamp; Watts.    Last year, some recapitalizations blindsided bondholders. In the most painful example, Colt Industries announced last July that it would borrow $1.4 billion to pay stockholders an $85-a-share dividend. Colt stock, unsurprisingly, soared on the news. But some long-term Colt bonds tumbled as much as $200 for each $1,000 face amount on the news. &quot;It was devastating,&quot; recalls one bond market professional.    So now, savvy bond investors try to avoid being hammered by recapitalizations. The simplest approach is practiced by Wells Fargo Investment Advisors, the big San Francisco index fund manager. Its bond funds try to diversify as much as possible, usually owning more than 500 different securities. That way, if one company's bonds are clobbered by a recapitalization, the overall impact on Wells's portfolios remains tiny.    A fancier approach involves &quot;screening&quot; the bond market to avoid possible recapitalizations. Bond professionals say the warning flags include the following:    --Companies with little existing debt, or with stock prices at a substantial discount to asset value. Such companies may attract raiders, eventually leading to a recapitalization.    --Companies with several discrete divisions, which could be sold separately. In Allegis's case, Coniston bought its stake largely on the belief that a breakup of the company would produce higher returns to shareholders.    --Companies with &quot;sleepy management.&quot; Once, these were a bondholders' dream, says Ms. Patel. &quot;You knew they wouldn't embark on anything reckless.&quot; But she avoids owning bonds in such companies now, for fear that raiders will step in, leading to a takeover battle that will hurt bondholders no matter what the outcome.    --Rising stock prices. In particular, takeover rumors and investors' filings of 5% or greater stock positions can send bondholders running for the exits. &quot;You can almost bet that what's good for the stock price will be bad for the bonds,&quot; says Ms. Patel.    As more bond investors try to outwit a company's recapitalization plans, those bond prices have begun falling well before the actual announcement. &quot;As soon as there's information in the stock market, it very quickly flows into the bond market,&quot; says Bruce Goddard, a vice president at Wells Fargo Investment. &quot;You can't get out at last night's prices.&quot;    In a few cases, such as Caesars World, part of the company's publicly traded debt has been in the form of convertible bonds. Those bonds trade in line with the underlying equity price, so they haven't suffered much in recapitalizations.    But that's faint solace for big fixed-income investors. &quot;Regardless of what recapitalizations do for stockholders, they're almost never good for bondholders,&quot; says an investment official at a major New York bank. &quot;It seems like it's just taking money out of one sector of the market, and moving it to another.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
