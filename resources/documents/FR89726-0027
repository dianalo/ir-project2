Therehas been one report of rupture of the main landing gear hinge arm duringlanding gear extension. Further investigation revealed that the lateraltrunnion on the actuating cylinder side was separated from the hinge arm.There was a visible crack on the lower part of the trunnion. Laboratoryinvestigation by the manufacturer revealed that a fatigue crack had developedbefore the rupture occurred. The crack started from burns produced duringa pad dadmium coating process. This condition, if not corrected, couldlead to collapse of the main landing gear. Airbus Industrie has issued Service Bulletin No. A300-32-390, Revision1, dated December 20, 1988, which describes procedures for replacing allhinge arms which have undergone a pad cadmium coating process. The servicebulletin references Messier-Hispano-Bugatti (MHB) Service Bulletin 470-32-651for additional replacement instructions. The DGAC has classified theseservice bulletins as mandatory, and has issued French Airworthiness Directive88-142-087(B) addressing this subject. This airplane model is manufactured in France and type certificated inthe United States under the provisions of andSection;21.29 of the FederalAviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design registered in the United States, an AD is proposedwhich would require replacement of all main landing gear barrel hinge arms,Messier Part Number C65381-4 or -6, which have a pad cadmium coating, withhinge arms which either have not been subjected to a pad cadmium coatingor have been reconditioned in accordance with MHB Service Bulletin 470-32-652.Airplanes that have undergone the MLG hinge arm pad cadmium plating inaccordance with Airbus Industrie Service Bulletin A300-32-356 (MHB ServiceBulletin 470-32-422), dated May 15, 1985, and have since undergone a mainworkshop overhaul and have been subjected to an electrolytic cadmium strippingand replating in a bath, or which have been reconditioned in accordancewith MHB Service Bulletin 470-32-652, are not subject to the requirementsof this AD. It is estimated that 53 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected bythis AD, that it would take approximately 6 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost would be $40 permanhour. The estimated cost for parts is $270. Based on these figures,the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $270,030.The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draftevaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket.A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Air transportation Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend Part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
