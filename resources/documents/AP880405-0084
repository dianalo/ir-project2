(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former President Carter says he neverheard of a plan to swap military parts for the 52 Americans heldhostage in Iran during the last year of his term.   ``No one that I have talked to had heard of it,'' he added at anews conference Monday night following a speech at Fresno StateUniversity.   Newly declassified documents revealed in a House Judiciarysubcommittee investigation showed the Carter administrationconsidered offering $10 million in military spare parts to Iran forthe hostages captured in November 1979 during an attack on the U.S.Embassy in Tehran.   Carter advisers scuttled the plan after determining arms dealerHoushang Lavi didn't have the backing of then-Iranian presidentAbolhassan Bani-Sadr, according to documents obtained by the MiamiHerald.   One CIA memo said Lavi offered to make a hostage exchange andhanded over a seven-page list of F-14 parts. The CIA officer whowrote the memo recommended against pursuing the deal.   Carter said he never saw any of the memos and that the plan was``never seriously considered.''   The documents include CIA memos to Carter's National SecurityCouncil chief David Aaron and State Department memos by then-DeputyAssistant Secretary Harold Saunders.   The papers surfaced during a hearing being held by Rep. JohnCoyers, D-Mich., into attempts by the Reagan administration totrade arms with Iran for hostages seized by Iran-backed ShiiteMoslems in Lebanon.   During his speech, Carter said the United States doesn't alwaysuse its power as it should to promote human rights.   ``When there is a silence from Washington, there is a worldwidesilence,'' he said. ``What the oppressed fear most is a silencefrom Washington.''   Carter, whose policy as president was to publicly criticizenations that abused human rights, told the crowd that the Reaganadministration has been ``on the wrong side of human rights issuesin almost every case.''   He urged that the next president develop a foreign policy thatwould ``alleviate suffering by the use of American influence.''</TEXT></DOC>
