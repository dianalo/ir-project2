Pittsburgh aims for more 1987 hiring in printing, landscaping, computer-related and TV production jobs, less in restaurant and cleanup work. Cleveland plans to fit many teen-agers into clerical and health-related jobs, shunning playground work that wastes kids' time, says Gregg Schoof, program chief. Only two of 34 cities in a Conference Board survey emphasize fast-food jobs.    Many cities include remedial education to bolster youths' qualifications. Dallas combines schoolwork and computer study with paying jobs. Employers agree to teach low-skilled youths because they see a trained-help shortage coming, says Robert Jewell, who heads the New York program.    An Oklahoma agency says the added cost of remedial education will reduce its job placements to about 1,000 this summer from 1,300 in 1986.    EPILEPTIC WORKERS lose a round, win one in discrimination cases.    A New Jersey appeals court rules that Food Circus Supermarkets Inc., Middletown, didn't show bias when it let go a meat cutter after his epileptic seizure in a training session. The court said the company showed itself willing to hire the disabled but that medical reports heightened concern that the worker's use of knives and saws was dangerous. The worker has appealed.    A federal appeals court in San Francisco rules that a lower court wrongly upheld the Labor Department's firing of an epileptic clerk-typist. The appeals judges told the lower court to decide if the clerk was fired strictly from bias as to her handicap and to decide whether the agency reasonably tried to accommodate her as an employee.    AIR BAGS WORK, government and private car-fleet managers report.    Ford Motor Co. has sold about 15,000 Tempos and Topazes with driver-side air bags, mostly to the General Services Administration and some insurance fleets. About 6,900 GSA cars have gone 140 million miles with 112 air-bag deployments and one death that was deemed unsurvivable when a big truck's bumper sliced into the car. The air bag &quot;has done everything it's supposed to do,&quot; says Sean Allen, a GSA official.    Travelers Insurance Co. has equipped 2,900 of its 3,200 field cars with air cushions, and the bag was deployed 22 times in accidents that &quot;totaled&quot; seven cars, with two injuries requiring hospitalization. An Allstate Insurance Co. sales manager says the bag saved him from death just last week.    GSA study says cost-benefit gains so far are limited because of the few air bags in use and because of high seat-belt usage by government drivers.    SURPRISING VIGOR? The U.S. had the largest manufacturing productivity gain in 1986 (3.5%) of 10 leading industrial nations, and the only unit labor-cost decline (0.6%), the Bureau of Labor Statistics says. Unit labor costs in Europe and Japan rose by up to 10%, or by as much as 43% when based on the falling dollar.    HER AMPLE BOSOM distracted male workers, so the company fired her, the former parts checker at Caterpillar Inc.'s Davenport, Iowa, tractor plant claimed. But Caterpillar says the woman was discharged for mistakes in noting inspection results. Who was right? Who knows? A secret settlement ended the sex-discrimination case.    PERSONNEL EXECUTIVES, by a 3-to-2 margin, favor a higher minimum wage as socially right, but 62% still object philosophically to the idea of a government-set wage floor, a Personnel Journal survey shows. Over half of the 250 executives queried said the proposed minimum-wage increase wouldn't affect company wages.    FIRST, DO NO HARM: Assay Technology, a California company, offers a kit to monitor worker exposure to xylene, a component of printing ink and cleaning solvents. But part of the exposed badge must be dipped in a developer that bears such warnings as &quot;Causes Severe Burns&quot; and &quot;Do Not Swallow or Inhale.&quot;    INCENTIVE PAY is extended deeper to lower management and &quot;key&quot; workers.    Companies are offering more individual bonuses for performance gains to supervisors below top management and to engineers, investment officials and others who they feel especially aid the company. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. rewards lower managers with up to 10% of their salary for &quot;extraordinary&quot; work. Shawmut Corp. has begun a similar bonus plan for about 120 of its bank lenders, giving as much as 25% of base pay.    Hewlett-Packard Co. gives 200 to 300 special stock options a year to employees who show extra accomplishment. Of 747 employers polled by management consultant Hay Group, 49% offer individual incentives to lower managers, 48% offer them to key professional and technical employees. Both figures are more than double a year ago.    Energy-equipment maker Camco Inc. shuns such plans. Says an official: &quot;We're pretty much team-oriented, and we're not looking for the superstar.&quot;    THE CHECKOFF: The Machinists Union last year indirectly aided Texas Air's takeover of Eastern Airlines out of dislike for Eastern chief Frank Borman; today, it plans a protest of the new regime's &quot;worker abuse.&quot; . . . Citing a plunge in unemployment-compensation claims, New Jersey's Labor Department lays off 167 employees. . . . Economist Frank Levy, on choosing the title &quot;Dollars and Dreams&quot; for a book on family-income patterns: &quot;I had to do something so Donahue would understand.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
