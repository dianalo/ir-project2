Under the plan, which Qintex said is designed to &quot;expedite the closing&quot; of the purchase and &quot;provide a more financially efficient structure,&quot; MGM/UA will change its name to Qintex America Inc. and will be purchased by Qintex Media B.V., a unit of Australia-based Qintex Australia Ltd. that owns 44% of Qintex Entertainment. Qintex Entertainment will then be merged with Qintex America, with Qintex America being the surviving, publicly traded company. The acquisition is scheduled to be completed by Sept. 30.    Industry observers said the new structure was designed for tax purposes.    Qintex Entertainment expects to finance the acquisition with $500 million or more in equity from potential investors in the U.S., Japan, Europe and the U.K. </TEXT></DOC>
