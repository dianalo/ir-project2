Earlier, about 200 uniformed air force men fled to a universitycampus and joined student leaders in the first major militarydefection to protesters seeking to end one-party rule.   The 82-year-old U Nu unveiled a 25-member government withhimself as prime minister, former President Mahn Win Maung aspresident and retired General Tin Oo as defense minister. Theannouncement was contained in a letter distributed to diplomaticmissions.   ``I have exercised my (constitutional) right at 9 a.m. thismorning. I have taken back the power which General Ne Win hasrobbed from me,'' U Nu wrote. ``From this hour, sovereign power nolonger rests with General Ne Win. It has come back into my hands,and I announce this fact with joy.''   U Nu was toppled in a coup led by Gen. Ne Win, who held thereins of power for the next 26 years. Although Ne Win officialretired as head of the ruling party last July, many analystsbelieve he still exercises decisive control.   There was no immediate reaction from the military or from thegovernment to U Nu's announcement.   ``We side with democracy and not with fascists!'' and ``Ourmilitary training is not to shoot people!'' the defecting soldiersshouted inside Rangoon University, the headquarters for studentrevolt.   The unarmed air force men, mostly sergeants and privates,sneaked out of Base 502 in the capital's Mingladpon area. They saidthe main gates were locked to prevent soldiers from leaving.   The air force base, the country's largest, is about 15 milesnorth of downtown Rangoon.   The first group of about 150 soldiers arrived at the campus atabout 6:30 a.m. and others arrived later in smaller groups.Students guarded the soldiers inside the dormitory.   The revolt came one day after about 1 million people surgedthrough the city in a massive strike and protest.   The march was largely peaceful, but sources said a mob killedtwo men and a woman who gave poisoned ice water to severaldemonstrators, including schoolchildren.   Senior government officials, uniformed state factory workers,Buddhist monks and Catholic nuns, housewives and a group of 200blind people joined in the protests. About 200 homosexuals alsoparticipated.   Residents said more than 700,000 protesters marched in thecentral city of Mandalay, 350 miles north of Rangoon, and inMonywa, an important trading town 60 miles northwest of Mandalay.More than 100,000 marched in Moulmein, the Mon State capital 50miles southeast of Rangoon.   A Western analyst in Bangkok said that despite the great show ofanti-government force, the top leaders appeared to be ``going aheadwith their own timetable'' of holding a special congress Monday topave the way for a referendum on Burma's future. He said thepowerful military also appeared to be basically intact despite somedefections and ``wavering''   ``The opposition has been effective in getting people out on thestreets but ineffective in moving the government. It just can'ttopple it over,'' the diplomat said.   The diplomat cited reliable reports that in Rangoon andelsewhere, the army has been trying to seize all food, fuel, andother essential items to dig in for the long-term ``and let thepeople starve.''   The army commandeered all supplies two weeks ago in Mandalay,the country's second-largest city and a major protest center, hesaid.   Thursday's protest was the largest since an estimated 1 millionmarched in Rangoon on Aug. 24 in the biggest demonstrations sincethe 1962 military coup.   President Maung Maung lifted martial law in Rangoon and curfewsnationwide on Aug. 24. He announced the Burma Socialist ProgramParty would meet Sept. 12 to consider organizing a referendum onone-party rule.   Maung Maung took power Aug. 19 as the country's first civilianleader in 26 years. But protesters have rejected the party meetingand demanded immediate formation of an interim government tooversee a transition to democracy.   Protesters blame the party's military autocracy for repressionand economic policies that transformed resource-rich Burma into oneof the world's poorest nations.   Marchers waved banners and shouted slogans as they converged onthe downtown area Thursday. Buddhist monks who joined students tolead the protests were joined by white-robed Catholic nuns andbrothers.   Also participating were employees of the Parliament office andthe Bureau of Special Investigation, or civilian intelligence.   Protesters held a noon memorial service and laid wreaths infront of City Hall, where several demonstrators were shot dead bysecurity forces Aug. 8 in rioting against hard-line President SeinLwin. He was forced to resign four days later.   Burma's turmoil mounted after students rioted in September 1987to protest economic policies. They then led broader-based streetprotests in March and June.   Street riots flared anew after strongman Ne Win resigned July 23after 26 years in power and the party chose Sein Lwin to succeedhim.   The government said 112 people died in Rangoon in riotingagainst Sein Lwin, who resigned after only 17 days. Diplomatsbelieve many more people were killed.</TEXT></DOC>
