French commentators have shied away from the subject in thejubilant homecoming of Jean-Paul Kauffmann, Marcel Carton andMarcel Fontaine, the last of 10 hostages welcomed by PremierJacques Chirac in two years.   Authorities have refused to discuss negotiations and, if historyis a guide, they never will. Chirac, facing presidential electionsSunday, denies there was a deal.   But sources with no stake in the negotiations describe thefollowing accord with Iran, which then pressured the Hezbollah andits terrorist wing, Islamic Jihad, to free the hostages:   _ France agreed to restore diplomatic relations with Iran, vitalbecause of Tehran's growing isolation, falling oil receipts,setbacks in the war with Iraq and losses to the United States inthe Persian Gulf.   _ France paid $400 million, the last segment of a billion-dollardispute over a nuclear-energy project. Iran still demands $1billion in interest. ``That is for next time,'' one Iranian sourcesaid, only half in jest.   _ Two terrorist groups in Lebanon received $10 million from amysterious Iranian businessman, likely to win lucrative favors fromboth countries.   _ France will reconsider the case of Anis Naccache, in prisonfor trying to assassinate former Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiarof Iran, but he is not likely to be freed immediately.   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, includedIranian emigres, Western diplomats and French officials.   France's sudden release last month of suspected terroristMohammed Mohajer also was involved in the deal, Iranian sourcessaid, adding that Mohajer is related to Sheik Ibrahim Amin,Hezbollah's official spokesman.   After the hostages returned home, an Iranian journalist said aswitchboard operator had begun answering, ``embassy,'' instead of``interest section,'' at Iran's Paris headquarters.   Algeria apparently guaranteed the arrangement in the name offriendship with France and Islamic solidarity. France made nocommitment to cut back its arms sales to Iraq, to sell more toIran, or to alter its Middle East policy.   The release was planned for just after April 25, the first roundof presidential elections, but was delayed when Syria tried to gainpartial credit, Iranian sources said.   Amir Taheri, former editor of the influential daily Khayyan inIran and now a political analyst, agreed with the sources' version.He said the deal clearly would encourage more terrorism.   ``We have reached a point where the taking of hostages is anaccepted international practice,'' he said. ``Iran sees it thatway, and so do others. It is a sad fact, but it is true.''   The negotiations brought muted scorn in Washington, where theReagan administration has been shaken by revelations of its ownsecret deal with Iran. In Britain, however, outrage was vehement.   Under a headline reading, ``Shame of the Craven French,'' thedaily Sun wrote:   ``We have always warned that you can't trust the French. Theycare only for themselves. But even by French standards ofchicanery, the deal ... has a nasty odor about it ... Unlike theFrench, we do not crawl at the feet of scum.''   Contempt was heightened by the sudden appearance in Paris ofDominique Prieur, remanded on trust by New Zealand after she wasconvicted of helping blow up the Greenpeace ship, Rainbow Warrior,in which one person died.   Chirac ended her confinement on a South Pacific island, two daysbefore the election, because she was pregnant and her father wasill. Her husband, an army captain, had been assigned to be with her.   Adding that to the hostage deal, London's Telegraph observed:   ``The French government seems determined to plumb the depths ofdishonor ... This is the country that calls us Perfidious Albion:That's unmitigated Gaul for you.''   French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua retorted:   ``We have not ceded to any claim. We have not accorded any fundsof any sort to anyone, not a franc, not a dollar, not adeutschmark, not a yen.''   The final arrangements were made by Ayatollah Janati Kermani andJean-Charles Marchiani, Pasqua's special envoy who confoundedeavesdroppers by talking to Paris in Corsican patois. Frenchsources said Marchiani had direct contacts with representatives ofHezbollah.   The trickiest part apparently was paying off what is now calleda loan in the Eurodif project, a consortium of France, WestGermany, Spain and Gabon to produce enriched African uranium fornuclear power plants.   Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi of Iran joined Eurodif in 1975,investing $1 billion for 11.75 percent of the shares and access touranium from a plant in southern France.   After its revolution in 1979, Iran renounced the deal and wantedits money back. France, arguing that the money was in shares, saidthe capital had to be sold.   As a gesture to Iran in 1986, Chirac paid back a third afterFrench negotiators agreed to convert Iran's particiption into aloan. He paid another third in November as part of a previoushostage deal.   The latest payment clears the original amount. But in a legalbattle that has already reached 50,000 pages of documents, Iranwants back interest because France has called the money a loan.   Relations were broken in precipitous events leading up to thelast hostage release.   Iranian Embassy officials in Paris refused to let Frenchauthorities question Wahid Gordji, an embassy official suspected ofinvolvement with terrorism. Police surrounded the embassy.   In turn, Iranian troops sealed off the French Embassy in Tehran.France said Iran had effectively severed relations.   Four months later, both sieges were lifted. Gordji was allowedto slip out of France, unquestioned. The Eurodif money was paid.And French hostages Roger Auque and Jean-Louis Normandin came home.</TEXT></DOC>
