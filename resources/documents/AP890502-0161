JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Consumer activist Ralph Nader on Tuesday saidExxon Corp. ``should not be allowed to forget'' the Alaskan oilspill and called for a consumer boycott of the giant oil company'sproducts.   Nader joined representatives from several environmental andconsumer groups in denouncing Exxon for its failure to be preparedfor and rapidly respond to the oil spill that has fouled hundredsof square miles of pristine water and shoreline along Alaska'ssouthern coast.   ``Exxon should not be allowed to forget this oil spill,'' saidNader, suggesting Exxon and the entire petroleum industry must bemade aware of public outrage over the spill.   ``Americans can take action now by voting with their steeringwheel and dollars against all Exxon products,'' Nader said at anews conference called in connection with a protest against the oilcompany in several cities across the nation.   An Exxon spokesman, Bill Smith, said in a telephone interviewfrom New York that more than 10,000 Exxon credit cards have beenturned in since the Alaska spill, but he could not speculate on howthe spill has affected Exxon sales.   There are about 7 million Exxon credit cards in circulation,Smith said.   Other groups represented at the press conference includedCitizen Action, a consumer organization that often deal withpetroleum related issues; the Environmental Policy Institute, acoalition of three environmental groups; Public Citizen and U.S.Public Interest Research Group, both advocacy groups founded byNader; and Clean Water Action, an environmental group.   Brent Blackwelder, chairman of the League of ConservationVoters, a lobbying organization that represents a variety ofenvironmental groups, suggested that a successful boycott of Exxonproducts would also send a message to Congress.   ``From the original authorization of the Alaska oil pipeline in1973 ... to the current state of affairs in which Exxon is makingtaxpayers and consumers pay for its negligence, the damaging roleof big oil's big money in American politics is all too apparent,''said Blackwelder.   Before a boycott is ended, the consumer and environmental groupssaid Exxon must pay all damage and cleanup costs from the spillinto Alaska's Prince William Sound; establish an additional $1billion trust fund for environmental protection in Alaska; promiseto conduct no oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refugeif it's opened for oil and gas development; and pay for developmentof safer oil tanks and better spill contingency programs.   Although oil industry leaders have said rising gasoline pricesare not directly related to the spill, Nader called on Exxon toroll back recent price increases.</TEXT></DOC>
