The government weather service said Skip, the second typhoon tostrike the Philippines in as many weeks, swept across Mindoro islandearly Tuesday and at mid-morning was reported about 150 milessouthwest of Manila in the South China Sea.   Maximum winds weakened to about 93 mph as the storm swept acrossthe central Visayas island chain, the weather service said.

Reports of damage and casualties from Typhoon Skip were sketchybecause of poor communications to the affected area. The Red Crosssaid at least five people were killed Monday in Camarines Surprovince.   They included three confirmed dead in a landslide in Pasacaoabout 210 miles southeast of Manila in Camarines Sur. The Red Crosssaid 23 people were reported buried in the mudslide but only threebodies had been recovered.

The RedCross said at least two other children died when a tornado triggeredby Skip roared through another town in Camarines Sur.   Most of the damage was reported in the Visayas and insoutheastern Luzon in the country's ``typhoon belt.''   Skip came ashore early Monday on Samar island, 410 milessoutheast of Manila, with winds up to 108 mph and moved across theislands of Masbate, Romblon and Tablas.   The Social Services Department reported nearly 400,000 people``affected'' by the typhoon, meaning their homes or property weredamaged or destroyed. It said most were on Leyte Island, which waswithout electricity because Skip's winds blew down power lines.   Departmental spokeswoman Teresita Padua estimated damage on Leytealone at about $400,000.   Government officials said about 24,000 people were affected onCebu island, mostly from flooding.   The coast guard said waves created by the typhoon sank afreighter in a Bohol Island port, but reported no casualties amongthe crew.   Storm warnings were posted in Manila and the government orderedschools closed Tuesday. Most domestic flights from the Manilaairport were canceled Tuesday but Philippine Airlines said servicewould be restored by nightfall.   The U.S. military's Far East Network television service said thesix American military installations, including Clark Air Base andthe Subic Bay naval base, could expect winds up to 60 mph earlyTuesday.   Some Military Airlift Command flights to Japan and the UnitedStates left early to avoid the storm, it said.   Heavy rains caused landslides on the Mayon volcano, 200 milessoutheast of Manila on Luzon's Bicol Peninsula, the Philippines NewsAgency said.   Hundreds of families were isolated by the slides and about 2,600were evacuated from the slopes of Mayon, the country's best-knownvolcano, the agency reported.   A coast guard report said the 326-ton freighter Sea Runner sankin port on Bohol on Monday after a battering by strong winds andheavy waves.
