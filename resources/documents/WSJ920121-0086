He was hauling a truckload of ore a few years back when&quot;he saw a pond of mush that the {mining} company was treatinglike it was gold, so he asked what it was,&quot; Mrs. Grishamsays, taking a break between customers at the beauty salonshe runs in her garage here. &quot;They told him there's $5million in that pond of mush.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The mush was a mineral called germanium, which, as anyCarthaginian can now tell you, is a critical ore withsignificant and increasing high-technology uses in computers,fiber optics and infrared night-vision devices, among otherthings. The presence of such a valuable ore was big news in atown that lives largely on royalties from mineral leases onits farmland. Bigger news was that Carthage, long mined forits zinc and cadmium, happens to sit on what may be therichest germanium deposit in North America. And bigger newsstill was that the local mining company, Union Zinc Inc.,wasn't paying townsfolk a penny in royalties for thegermanium it was digging out from beneath their land.   This is a company town, where Union Zinc is loved andfeared, so even after Mr. Grisham found the pond of mush,things might never have gone beyond the muttering stage. Butthis is also the home of Albert Gore Sr., the former U.S.senator, director of Occidental Petroleum Corp., father ofthe one-time presidential contender and owner of 255 acres ofgermanium-enriched farmland. He and his wife, Pauline, don'tlike the situation any better than their neighbors do, andthey have sued Union Zinc to collect payments. The case goesto arbitration today. If the Gores win, it could meanmillions of dollars in additional royalties for the residentsof this riverside tobacco-farming community.   &quot;There's a lot of mixed emotions about suing the company,&quot;says Kenneth Lawrence, a recently retired restaurateur. Mr.Lawrence's son works in the mine for $11 an hour, and hisrestaurant business depended on miners, but he is also alandowner who gets royalty payments on his mineral rights.   There are mixed emotions at Union Zinc, too, abouttangling with the Gore family. &quot;Gore could be president someday,&quot; frets Richard Dendler, vice president of mining,referring to Albert Gore Jr. The Democratic senator and hiswife, Tipper, own an 88-acre farm here and are alsoplaintiffs in the suit.   Union Zinc, a subsidiary of the Belgian company ACEC-UnionMiniere S.A., leases mineral rights from practically everyonein Carthage and nearby Gordonsville, operating a labyrinthinemine that stretches beneath both towns. Terms of the leasescall for Union Zinc to pay a 4% royalty on the value ofminerals it extracts.   The company has been paying landowners royalties for zincand cadmium, but not for germanium. It argues that the leasesrequire it to pay royalties on the value of the minerals &quot;atthe mill,&quot; or in their freshly mined state. Because germaniummust be extracted from the raw zinc ore to have any marketvalue, the company says it isn't obligated to pay royaltieson it. &quot;The presence or absence of germanium is not material&quot;to the royalty calculation, says Robert S. Marquis, anattorney for Union Zinc.   But the Gores' lawyer, Robert J. Walker, says what isimmaterial is the extra processing required to extract thegermanium. He argues that the presence of germanium makes theore inherently more valuable &quot;at the mill.&quot; &quot;Would anyoneargue that a truckload of zinc ore with gold nuggets in itisn't more valuable than a truckload of zinc ore without goldnuggets?&quot; he asks. &quot;You still have to extract it and polishit, but it still has value.&quot; He says his clients would bepaid 60% more than their current royalties if germanium wereincluded in the royalty calculation.   The argument was ignited after Mr. Grisham found the pondand told his wife Betty Louise about it, who told PaulineGore, who told Albert Sr., who went to Washington to visitAlbert Jr. and stopped off at the Library of Congress to readup on germanium. &quot;I became a student of germanium,&quot; says thesenior Mr. Gore, now 84 years old. &quot;I found out that it isdesignated as a strategic metal by the U.S. DefenseDepartment because of its critical uses in the defensesystem.&quot;   Soon all of Carthage was buzzing about germanium, agrayish-white metal with semiconducting properties that hassold for as much as $500 a pound in recent years. It wasfirst isolated in 1886 (by a German). It was used to make thefirst transistor, in 1947. Scientists at IBM have used itrecently to double the speed of silicon-based transistors.Germanium is being tested as an ingredient in solar cells topower large satellites, and as part of a new fiber-opticlighting system for automobiles. Some people put a form ofgermanium under their tongues in the belief that it will curecancer, arthritis and migraine headaches.   Union Zinc won't say how much germanium is in the ground,but the U.S. Bureau of Mines says the mine contains thelargest reserve of germanium in the U.S.   Johnny Wilkerson, owner of the local ShopRite grocery,says with a laugh that he &quot;got out the encyclopedia I boughtfor the daughter. I read up on `geranium'.&quot; Mr. Wilkerson,who owns 160 acres under which Union Zinc is mining, was ableto stop farming and buy his grocery store with the nearly$30,000 in royalties he receives annually. &quot;If germanium wereadded to the minerals I'm paid for, I could start anothergrocery store and get ready to retire,&quot; Mr. Wilkerson says.   Now the town regularly follows the price of germanium. &quot;Iread the business news or Metals Week to see quotes,&quot; saysMr. Lawrence, who until last fall ran the WoodjammerRestaurant here.   Just across the highway from the Woodjammer, in thecorporate headquarters of Union Zinc, a sign reminds all whoenter that the company pays $762,000 annually in state andlocal taxes, has a $9.1 million payroll and pays $1.7 millionin annual royalties to local landowners. Outsideheadquarters, at the mine's main entrance, miners in overallsand hard hats climb into a steel elevator cage and ride 120stories down into the earth. At the bottom of the shaft theyjump into big dump trucks and ride off through the mine's 230miles of tunnels to begin blasting.   James Moore, general mine foreman, finds a section of rockcontaining veins of 15% zinc, well above the average 3%concentration in this rock. He shows the glimmering brownstreaks to his boss, Mr. Dendler, who -- noting theirlocation in the labyrinth -- happily exclaims, &quot;This isn'tGore ore]&quot;   The Gores signed their original mineral leases in 1969with Occidental Minerals Corp., a unit of OccidentalPetroleum Co., when Albert Sr. was still in the U.S. Senate.After he left office in 1971, Mr. Gore joined OccidentalPetroleum as an officer and director. Occidental sold themineral leases to Union Zinc in 1985.   Mr. Gore's intimate understanding of the law and of miningenabled him to take a litigious step ahead of his neighbors.He sued Union Zinc in Smith County Chancery Court inCarthage, but the judge ordered that the case go toarbitration as required under terms of the lease.   &quot;No one has ever questioned the company,&quot; says CharlesMcKinney, a Carthage resident who is a farmer by day and alawyer by night. &quot;Everyone is waiting to see what happenswith the Gores' lawsuit.&quot; Mr. McKinney himself has filed asuit against Union Zinc over germanium royalties, and isseeking to have it declared a class action on behalf of some200 landowners. But he says that filing the suit was&quot;strictly a business decision&quot; and that &quot;we couldn't ask fora better corporate neighbor.&quot; (That suit is on hold pendingthe outcome of the Gore arbitration.)   Still, there are signs that Carthaginians have becomeemboldened by the germanium affair. There is talk of pressingfor royalties on other rocks that come out of this ground:the crystals of calcite, fluorite and sphalerite that UnionZinc occasionally stumbles across and sells to collectors.Buyers come from around the world to bid for the crystals,which can cost thousands of dollars each.   Union Zinc says it doesn't owe landowners a royalty on thecrystals because removing them costs more than the prices forwhich they are sold. But Mrs. Gore Sr. isn't so sure. &quot;Theserocks are peanuts compared to the germanium for which we'renot being paid, but we want our fair share,&quot; she says. &quot;It'sthe principle. We would rather leave the rocks, thegermanium, everything in the ground for our grandchildrenthan to give it away for nothing.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
