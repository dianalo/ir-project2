60MB tape backup, $750.andM;In Short: The Hertz 16- and 25-MHz machines are ones to look at if yourpriorities are dependability are reliability rather than blinding speed.andO;Their Intel motherboards are eight layers deep, large enough to givevalue-added resellers the opportunity to write software for them.andP;  Also, itmeans that these systems will run anything ever written for the 386processor.andM;Hertz aims its products at the value-added-reseller market and largecorporate clients; reliability and quality are it sales tools.andP;  The two 386machines we received--the 386/16, base priced at $2,695, and thehigher-speed, $ 4,959 386/25--exemplify the company's commitment toengineering dependable, if not lightning-fast, systems.andM;Intel, an industry leader if ever there was one, makes not only the chips andthe motherboard, but also the power supply and chassis.andP;  The BIOS is from theever-capable Phoenix, and equally reputable companies supply most of theother components.andM;The Intel motherboards are eight layers deep, large enough to accommodate theesoteric logic that the manufacturers of motherboards with fewer layers mustleave out.andP;  Although most commercial programs do not require this logic, itspresence gives value-added resellers the opportunity to write software thatmakes use of it.andP;  It also means that these systems will run anything everwritten for the 386 processor.andM;Speed is a secondary consideration for these machines, so it's surprise thatneither really shone on our benchmark tests: the 16-MHz unit compared morefavorably to those in its class but had noticeably low scores on theConventional and Extended Memory tests.andP;  The 386/25's test system scoredpoorly on the processor tests, but its ESDI Western Digital controller and330MB Micropolis hard disk helped it do better in the File Access tests.andM;Both machines are roomy enough for the standard five half-height bays and a220-watt power supply with five connectors.andP;  In addition to the 2MB of RAM,controller, 1.2MB 5-1/4-inch floppy disk drive, and one parallel and twoserial ports included in the base price, the systems we received each sporteda 1.44MB 3-1/2-inch floppy disk drive, a Hertz multiscanning monitor, andVideo Seven's 16-bit VGA card, as well as Hertz's own Keyboard, which givesyou good, crisp feedback.andM;HERTZ 386/16andM;The 16-MHz 386, at 16-1/2 by 21 by 6-1/2 inches (HDW), is about the same sizeas a PC AT; the strong metal case helps it earn an FCC Class B rating.andP;  Onthe 386/16 as well as the 386/25, power and disk access are indicated by LEDson the front panel; there are no buttons to reset the machines, ans switchingto 8 MHz can be accomplished only through software.andM;The zero-wait-state 386/16 comes standard with the maximum 2MB of100-nanosecond RAM in SIMM packs on the motherboard and eight expansionslots, two of which can accommodate either 2MB or 8MB 32-bit memory boards.andO;Four 16-bit slots also come standard; in the $4,495 system we received, oneof these slots was filled with a Western Digitalmodified-frequency-modulation (MFM) controller for the 72MB Micropolis harddisk.andP;  Two additional slots were taken up by the video board and parallel andserial ports, leaving one 16-bit and two 8-bit slots available for furtherexpansion.andM;HERTZ 386/25andM;The 386/25, also a Class B-certified machine, is 2 inches deeper and slightlymore rigid than the 386/16.andP;  The motherboard on the zero-wait-state unitnearly mirrors that found on the 16-MHz machine, except that it offers anadditional serial port and can pack up to 8MB of RAM.andP;  With 5MB RAM, theprice of the tested system rose to $ 10,470.andM;The slot configuration differs a bit from the 386/16: with the 25-MHz machineyou get the 22-bit slots, as well as one 8-bit and five 16-bit slots,obviously a preferable combination.andP;  A few additional perks--like a real-timeCMOS clock chip with an integral lithium battery, room for 24MB of RAM, and64K of fast cache memory using 35-ns.andP;  chips--are also included with thismachine.andM;The 386 chip on this system also has a heat-sink positioned above it and anextra fan for more cooling capacity.andP;  These provisions for greater coolingcapacity are necessary for anyone who has the full 24MB of RAM operating at25 MHz.andP;  Like the extra-rigid chassis, the extra fan will increase thelongevity of the machine, especially in hostile environments.andM;The price of the 25-MHz unit also includes on-site support service fromIntel.andP;  An on-site contract can be bought for the 16-MHz model for pricesranging from $325 to $600.andP;  Overall, the Hertz machines are ones to look atif your priorities are dependability and reliability rather than blindingspeed.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
