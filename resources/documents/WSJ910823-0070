Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index gained0.74 to a record high of 391.33, and the Nasdaq CompositeIndex, a measure of small stock prices, added 0.33 to 518.30,another record.   With the coup over, investors' attention snapped back todomestic concerns, especially the economy's questionablehealth. The latest evidence of weakness: Initial claims forjobless benefits in the week ended Aug. 10 rose 22,000, muchmore than expected.   More money managers suspect that the feeble economicrecovery is running out of steam. They're hoping the FederalReserve will move quickly to lower short-term interest ratesonce again to stimulate economic activity.   &quot;A double-dip recession is a higher probability than mostpeople think,&quot; said Arthur Micheletti, a vice president atBailard, Biehl andamp; Kaiser, a money-management firm in SanMateo, Calif. &quot;Most people are putting the odds at zero, butwe think it's more like 15% to 20%.&quot;   He said the stock market is overvalued at current levelsand can't expect much help from the bond market. For onething, he said, short-term interest rates already are so lowthey aren't likely to fall much further. And any decline inlong-term rates would probably be associated with economicweakness that would depress future corporate profits. &quot;Forthe most part, we're staying pretty defensive,&quot; he said.   In the bond market, traders continued to move out of the&quot;safe haven&quot; of short-term securities and intohigher-yielding, longer-term maturities. If the economy stayssluggish, or slips back into recession, traders are lookingfor long-term rates to decline from current levels ofslightly more than 8%.   Currency traders continued to sell the dollar to buy theGerman mark. Traders drove the dollar sharply higher Mondayas the Soviet coup unfolded, but began returning to the markTuesday as the coup attempt faltered. Germany would have beenthe nation most likely to suffer an economic impact if thecoup had succeeded. But it also has relatively high interestrates, which, other things being equal, are attractive tointernational investors.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices crept higher in active trading. Volumetotaled 172.9 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange,where 896 stocks advanced and 698 fell.                                                                                                          Bond prices rose. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bondrose an eighth of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 faceamount. The yield on the issue slipped to 8.05%.                                                                                                          The dollar was mixed.
