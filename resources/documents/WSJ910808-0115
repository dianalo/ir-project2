The big freeze between the Soviet Union and theU.S. is past us. But Mr. Bush is neglecting a still-importantcold spot: Cuba.   The president might have used the Pan Am contest in Havanaas a platform for truly creative American diplomacy --engaging Fidel Castro in dialogue, negotiation andcompromise. But he seems content to leave American policytoward Cuba on auto-pilot, going nowhere.</LP><TEXT>   Inaction on America's Cuba policy is not merely careless.It is dangerous. It makes the president and the Americanpeople appear duplicitous and insincere as they fashion the&quot;new world order.&quot;   While Mr. Castro's Cuba remains subject to Washington'strade embargo, China -- the new headquarters of worldcommunism -- enjoys most favored nation trading status. Iraq-- which has yet to surrender its chemical, biological andnuclear arms -- receives food and medical aid despite aworldwide prohibition on trade with Saddam Hussein. Cubacannot.   The double standard is confusing to the Cuban leadershipand counterproductive to long-term U.S. interests. The Bushadministration asks Cuba to develop a market economy, to holdinternationally supervised elections, and to reduce its armedforces. But it makes no such demands of China. Even Vietnamis edging toward normal relations with this country withoutthe preconditions Cuba faces.   Cast in terms of individual lives, the Bush position iseven more regrettable, given the suffering the embargoinflicts on innocents. Every day at Miami InternationalAirport, one can see Cuban travellers boarding flights homeloaded with basic medical and first-aid supplies. A jocularCuban woman, only half-hiding the pain of severe shortages onthe island, invites an invasion from the U.S. &quot;Go ahead andbomb us,&quot; she says. &quot;But with aspirin and milk for thechildren, and VCRs.&quot; This woman, once imprisoned by theCastro government, says that access to American products,rather than the continued embargo, would increase U.S.influence.   Opponents of a new Cuba policy -- including this newspaper-- give several reasons when they argue that the U.S. shouldnot normalize relations. They say Cubans will not negotiatein good faith. They charge Mr. Castro continues to supportsubversive groups. And they charge negotiations would offer acure to a dictator on his political deathbed.   The facts suggest the opposite is true. Cubans have proventhey can make and keep commitments, when it is in theirinterest to do so. The release of political prisoners wasnegotiated in 1978. A migration agreement in 1984 began therepatriation of Cuban criminals to Cuba and the entry offormer political prisoners to the U.S. In 1988, Cuba agreedto withdraw all troops from Angola, thus meeting one of thechief preconditions for normalized relations imposed by theCarter and Reagan administrations. The last Cuban soldiersleft Angola in May of this year. Mr. Castro has even urgederstwhile clients in Central America -- notably guerrillas inEl Salvador -- toward the negotiating table. Significantly,the Castro regime this week unilaterally loosened travelrestrictions for its citizens. It is the U.S. that is nowmany Cubans' biggest travel obstacle: Last month the StateDepartment suspended the processing of new applications forvisitor visas from Cuba.   What else do the Cold Warriors have wrong? Reports of Mr.Castro's imminent demise are greatly exaggerated. It makes nosense to mortgage any future relationship with Cuba to thehope that Mr. Castro's successor will be as compliant asWashington wants. Judging from my interviews with many Cubans-- from foreign ministry officials to the regime's critics inthe streets -- I found no indication of such a course.   The biggest loss in the current policy is America's.Without normal relations, the U.S. loses its best opportunityto shape a post-Castro Cuba. With full diplomatic, businessand cultural ties, the U.S. would have access to the Cubanpeople -- and the influence that goes along with it. Today,ordinary Cubans know little of America except for what theylearn from American movies and sporadic press reports. Ourown policy gives Mr. Castro the luxury of being able to paintthe U.S. as the global bully.   Mr. Castro has succeeded in mending fences with the othernations of the hemisphere -- the only countries he everreally threatened. In the last month, Paraguay, Colombia andChile agreed to re-establish limited diplomatic relationswith Cuba. The U.S. should take a cue from its Latin Americanneighbors and make peace with Havana. The notion that anisland nation of 10.5 million people threatens a superpowerof 250 million is, in 1991, more ludicrous than ever.   Television made the Pan-American games -- and Cuba --accessible to Americans. Now it is time for the White Houseand Congress to deepen that access. Like a pre-revolutionarystogie that someone forgot to put out, the 30-year-old policytoward Cuba is stale and smoldering. George Bush shouldextinguish it once and for all.   ---   Mr. Schierholz, a former staff writer for the ChristianScience Monitor, recently spent six weeks in Cuba sponsoredby the Ford Foundation and the Cuba Policy Project of JohnsHopkins University.
