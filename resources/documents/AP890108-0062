Town councilor Yussef Mohammed Milhem survived the attack, whichcame after calls in underground leaflets to punish collaborators andforce Israeli-appointed Palestinian officials to resign.   Also Sunday, Palestinians closed stores and schools throughoutthe Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in a general strikemarking 13 months of the uprising. Since the uprising began Dec. 8,1987, 348 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed.   At least 12 Palestinians were shot and wounded in Sunday clasheswith soldiers in the occupied territories, said Arab reports andhospital officials.   An army spokesman confirmed that two youths were wounded in armygunfire and said he was checking other reports of injuries.   A preliminary police report Sunday indicated an Israeli taxidriver slain Thursday in the West Bank was killed by Palestiniannationalists, Israel radio said.   Shmuel Edri, 42, of Tel Aviv, was shot twice in the chest nearthe Jewish settlement of Yakir, 25 miles north of Jerusalem. Policefound footprints of two people leading from the car to the Arabvillage of Bani Hassan, the radio said.   The military government in the territories also announced Sundaythat international telephone service was restored to the West Bankand Gaza after 10 months.   Service was cut to block contacts from the territories toPalestine Liberation Organization officials overseas. There was noimmediate explanation for the restored service.   Hospital officials said the wounded in Sunday's clashes includeda 16-year-old shot in the face and a 15-year-old hit in the stomach.   A 10-year-old girl also was reported shot in the face by a rubberbullet.   In the West Bank town of Jenin, five people were slightly injuredwhen two firebombs thrown at an Israeli bank exploded, Israel armyradio reported.   In Israel, police said a 21-year-old Palestinian was arrestednear the Arab village of Umm Al Fahm after a firebomb was thrown atan Israeli bus. It caused no injuries or damage.   The army imposed curfews on five Gaza refugee camps because ofSunday's strike, confining at least 150,000 Palestinians to theirhomes indefinitely.   Curfews and the strike kept tens of thousands of Palestiniansfrom jobs in Israel. The strike, called by the pro-PLO UnifiedNational Leadership of the Uprising, stopped public transportationand closed all businesses and schools.   Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist organization opposed to PLOchief Yasser Arafat's peacemaking efforts, has called a strike forMonday. It is viewed as a challenge to the PLO's local leadership.   The latest attack against a Palestinian accused of links toIsrael came in the early hours of Sunday in the West Bank city ofQalqilya.   Milhem, 45, was stabbed in the head when he went to QalqilyaHospital for treatment of a minor illness, officials said.   He was transferred to an Israeli hospital, where he was reportedin fair condition after surgery.   ``This is not acceptable at all. Everyone condemns it,'' saidAbdel Rahman Abu Sneineh, Israeli-appointed mayor of the city of20,000.   Friday night, West Bank village leader Mahmoud Abdallah Hamoudah,67, was killed. Israel radio said he as suspected of collaboratingwith Israel.   On Wednesday, Bassam Barameh, 25, of Jericho, was shot to death.Palestinian residents said he was a suspected collaborator.   More than a dozen suspected collaborators have been killed in theuprising.</TEXT></DOC>
