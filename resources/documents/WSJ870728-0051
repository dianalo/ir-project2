Meanwhile, in another SEC filing, a shareholder group including MIM Ltd., a London investment advisory firm, said it intends to seek a higher bid from the Gabelli group. If the Gabelli affiliates are unwilling to negotiate, the MIM group -- which said it owns 577,500, or 6.8%, of Di Giorgio's common shares -- said it will try to change the Di Giorgio board to adopt policies more beneficial to shareholders.    The diversified San Francisco food distributor rejected the Gabelli bid last Tuesday, and said it would explore other options to maximize shareholder value.    In their filing, Gabelli-Rosenthal andamp; Partners and Gandamp;R Partners said they would like to be considered as partners in a leveraged buy-out by Di Giorgio's management, if such an action is pursued. The partnerships are part of a group that own 2,408,700 shares, or 28.3% of Di Giorgio.    A Di Giorgio official said a leveraged buy-out by management is one of many alternatives being explored but no decision has been reached. In response to MIM, he said management &quot;has always made return to the shareholders the No. 1 priority, and will continue to do so.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
