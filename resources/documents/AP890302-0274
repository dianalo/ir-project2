Presidential Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater suggested thedecision may not come before Friday, when Bush plans to meet withtop advisers on the situation.   The International Association of Machinists is set to strikeEastern at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday.   A federal judge was considering a motion today to allow themachinists union to picket five other major airlines _ Northwest,USAir, United, Piedmont, and Trans World _ in the event of a strike.   The union also has said it plans pickets at rail, sea and othertransportation companies, along with sister airline Continental andTexas Air Corp., parent firm of Eastern and Continental.   Federal mediators have urged Bush to stop the strike, which themachinists say could disrupt air, rail and sea transportationnationwide.   Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and labor leaders have alsourged the president to use his presidential powers to declare anational transportation emergency, postponing any strike for 60 dayswhile a special panel investigates.   Jackson, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination lastyear, met with Bush at the White House on Wednesday night,presumably to discuss the Eastern situation. However, Fitzwater saidhe did not know what the two discussed in the private session.   As to stopping the strike for 60 days, ``No decision has beenmade,'' Fitzwater said today.   Earlier, he said Bush would make his decision on whether to stepin before the midnight Friday deadline, which marks the end of a30-day cooling-off period after failure of the National MediationBoard's yearlong efforts to resolve the dispute.   Eastern, which says it is losing about $1 million a day, wants tocut salaries to save $150 million. The International Association ofMachinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents 8,500 Easternbaggage handlers and other ground services workers, wants $50million in salary increases.   Eastern opposes presidential intervention, which would also delayfor 60 days the airline's power to make salary cuts. The union wantsBush to act.   The recommendation last week from the two-member board that Bushcall an emergency panel had been received by the White House, butthe president had not yet gotten the benefit of a staffrecommendation, spokesman Stephen Hart said Wednesday.   Bush was in Asia when the board, which mediates labor disputesinvolving railways and airlines, proposed presidential action.   The mediation board has the power to call for a presidentialemergency panel when it believes ``a sector of the country could beor is being deprived of essential transportation services.''   Under the law, Bush would appoint three members to the panel toexamine the matter and make a report within 30 days.   The board has made several requests for emergency panels inrailway labor disputes in recent years but none involving an airlinesince one that averted a threatened Pan American World Airwaysstrike in 1966. Congress ordered a special panel in a Wein-AlaskanAir dispute in 1978, however.   Joseph Guerrieri, union attorney, filed the motion in federalcourt Wednesday to get a ruling allowing the union to picket otherairlines with which it has contracts.   The airlines argue that ``no strike'' language in their contractsforbids such action. The union, said Guerrieri, maintains that a1987 Supreme Court ruling allowing secondary picketing under theRailway Labor Act precludes the no-strike provision.   AFL-CIO leaders have vowed to do everything legally possible tohelp the union ground Eastern, Continental and Texas Air in theevent of a strike.   Eastern's pilots have said they would decide after a strike iscalled whether to cross picket lines. Texas Air chairman FrankLorenzo made a personal appeal to the pilots Wednesday to sign a newcontract and continue working. The pilots have separate negotiationswith the airline.   Eastern says it cannot afford further delay before cutting costs.   The union accuses the airline of planning to transfer itsoperations to non-union Continental. Texas Air is awaiting finalgovernment approval to sell off Eastern's money-making East Coastshuttle operations to New York real estate magnate Donald Trump.</TEXT></DOC>
