Foreign Minister Pik Botha, as well as several pro-governmentnewspapers, criticized comments this week by U.S. State Departmentofficial Herman Cohen, who said he expects the white-controlledgovernment to legalize outlawed groups and begin talks with themwithin nine months.   The state broadcasting company belittled a French plan to inviteSouth African officials and leaders of the African NationalCongress to a conference in Paris.   Sisulu, 77, the outlawed group's general secretary, wassentenced in 1964 along with Nelson Mandela and other ANC leadersto life in prison for plotting anti-government sabotage.   The Citizen, a Johannesburg daily, quoted an unidentifiedgovernment source as saying the Cabinet had decided to free Sisulubut said the source refused to give a date. The newspaper saidblack activist Oscar Mpetha, 80-year-old leader of the UnitedDemocratic Front, also was likely to be released.   Mandela, considered by many blacks as their paramount leader, isunlikely to be freed this year, The Citizen said.   The Daily Mail newspaper in London quoted diplomatic sourcesWednesday as saying Sisulu and Mpetha would be freed before BritishPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher goes to Malaysia for the annualCommonwealth summit conference on Oct. 18. Mrs. Thatcher has beencriticized by other Commonwealth leaders for her refusal to imposetough sanctions on South Africa.   Despite the possibility of prisoner releases, the government hasgiven no sign of softening its attitude toward negotiations withthe African National Congress.   President F.W. de Klerk, since his inauguration last month, hasreiterated that such talks cannot take place until the grouprenounces the use of violence as a means to end apartheid, SouthAfrica's system of segregation that denies blacks a vote innational affairs.   Botha, in a statement Thursday, criticized remarks made inWashington by Cohen, assistant secretary of state for Africanaffairs. Cohen told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee heexpected South African officials to act by next June to legalizeorganizations, repeal remaining segregation laws and opennegotiations with credible black leaders.   ``South Africans should retain the right not only to create ourown constitutional future, but to do so without threats or timelimits imposed from outside,'' Botha said. ``I trust that Mr. Cohenwill also urge the perpetrators of violence to end their violentcampaign in a determined time frame.''   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. criticized theplan for the Paris conference, planned for November by French FirstLady Danielle Mitterand to discuss South Africa's political future.It said such a conference would amount to no more than an attemptto boost the African National Congress' image.   Also Thursday, the Chamber of Mines marked its centennial byissuing a report that depicted itself as a progressive forceworking to eliminate discrimination in the mining industry.   ``We have the opportunity in the mining industry to break down(racial) barriers and build bridges,'' said the chamber'spresident, Kenneth Maxwell.   But the National Union of Mineworkers, which represents blackminers, said the centennial marks ``100 years of toil and poverty.''   The chamber serves as mouthpiece, research institute andbargaining agent for six giant corporations that control 90 percentof South Africa's mining operations and generate more than 20percent of the country's total wealth.</TEXT></DOC>
