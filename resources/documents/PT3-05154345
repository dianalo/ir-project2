No. 07/446,121, filed Dec. 5, 1989, entitled &quot;A Secure Container For      Disposable Sharps&quot;, abandoned. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to containers for disposable hospital sharps      and waste, and pertains particularly to a secure disposable container      assembly for disposition of hospital sharps, objects and wastes. </PAR><PAR>  Hospitals and clinics use great quantities of sharps, such as needles,      syringes, surgical blades, and the like, that are disposed of rather than      cleaned and reused. It is necessary that the sharps be disposed of in a      manner that prevents them being reused without sterilization. In      particular, it is necessary to keep them from falling into the hands of      those, such as drug users and the like, that are likely to use them      without proper sterilization. </PAR><PAR>  Numerous containers have been developed in recent years, which are      reasonably secure and disposable for receiving and disposing of hospital      sharps, wastes and the like. Many of these containers however do not      provide adequate security against pilfering of used syringes and the like      from such containers. While containers have been developed which cannot      readily be reopened and articles cannot be easily removed therefrom, such      containers must be kept in a secure place to prevent unauthorized removal. </PAR><PAR>  It is essential that access openings into the containers be easy and      convenient to use, yet prevent access thereto for removal of articles.      This requires that the opening be adequate in size to receive the article,      be conveniently located and that it has a suitable closure to prevent      removal of articles. It is also necessary that the article be received      into the container without undue action by the user. While many excellent      closures exist, improvements are desirable. </PAR><PAR>  In prior U.S. Pat. No. 4,702,385, of which I am co-inventor, we disclose a      security mounting device for disposable containers. That device includes a      metal mounting bracket, with a complex metal latching arrangement for      securely latching a disposable container within a secured container      housing. While that prior device is suitable for many applications,      certain improvements are desirable. </PAR><PAR>  It is, therefore, desirable that an improved securable disposable container      assembly be provided. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is the primary object of the present invention to provide an improved      securable disposable container assembly. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with a primary aspect of the present invention, a secure      disposable container assembly comprises a housing for securely mounting to      a support member, and having an access opening in a top front for      receiving a disposable article and preventing access to the interior of      the container by the human hand. Means are provided for locking the      housing to a support bracket to prevent removal of the container. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING </PAC><PAR>  The above and other objects and advantages of the present invention will      become apparent from the following description when read in conjunction      with the accompanying drawings wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a front elevation view of an exemplary embodiment of the      invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a top plan view of the embodiment of FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a detailed partial view in section taken on line 3--3 of FIG. 2; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a detailed partial view in section taken on line 4--4 of FIG. 3; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a detailed partial back view of the container with portions      broken away to reveal details; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a partial side elevation view in section; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a partial side elevation view in section showing the container      mount; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a view taken generally on line 8--8 of FIG. 7; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a top plan view of the latch release key. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 1 of the drawing, there is illustrated an exemplary      embodiment of the invention, which comprises a generally rectangular      box-like housing, designated generally by the numeral 10, and formed of      the usual plastic material for such containers. The housing in its      preferred form is formed of a lower substantially rectangular shell,      having a front wall or panel 12 and a back wall or panel 14 (FIG. 5)      defining front and back walls, and further including opposed side walls 16      and 18, all terminating at a top rectangular peripheral edge 20. A      generally semi-circular top shell 22 is hinged at 24 to the top front edge      of the rectangular shell 10. </PAR><PAR>  The top 22 and bottom may be molded together with a live hinge or they be      molded separately and utilize a snap lock hinge 24, as generally      illustrated. A live hinge is a thin strip of the housing material      connecting the two members and allowing them to pivot relative to one      another. The hinge comprises a plurality of upwardly directed hooks on one      member for hooking under a plurality of hinge pins formed or mounted in a      plurality of tabs on the other member. The hooks have detents into which      the hinge pin or pins snap into. A tab lock assembly includes tabs 26 on      the top and tab sockets on the upper or top back edge of the container to      permanently lock the top 22 in the covering position as shown. </PAR><PAR>  The container top and bottom is preferably blow molded of a suitable      plastic, and preferably formed with a slight taper from top to bottom to      enable stacking for ease of shipment. The top 22 has a generally      semi-cylindrical configuration about a horizontal axis, about which a      pivoting closure member is mounted. Referring to FIG. 2, the top 22 is      provided with a top front opening 30 of a generally elongated      configuration having circular or oval ends. This opening is formed in the      upper front one side of the top extending approximately one-half the      length of the top. This opening is designed to receive syringes and the      like for disposal and to secure the syringes against unauthorized      retrieval. </PAR><PAR>  The opening is closed by a pivoting closure member or unit, as illustrated      in FIGS. 3-4, of a substantially unitary structure designated generally by      the numeral 32. The closure member has a generally horizontal face or      ledge portion 34 disposed below the opening 30, and a substantially      vertical face portion 36 forming a continuation of the face 34, extending      upward at approximately a one-hundred five degree angle. These faces      together form a combination closure and receiving support for disposable      articles, such as a syringe or the like 38 as illustrated. The closure      unit 32 includes a curved surface portion 40 extending backward from the      upper or top edge of the face portion 36, thereby forming a closure for      extending over the opening 30 when the closure member pivots about      horizontal axis 42 for dumping article 38. An end wall portion 44 of the      closure member adds strength and rigidity to the closure unit. </PAR><PAR>  The closure unit 32 is mounted for pivotal movement about a pair of pins,      one at each end, which are rotatably mounted in snap in journals in the      ends of the top. A counter weight 46 formed as an extending piece of the      closure unit 32 extends downward from the axis of the pivot pins and pivot      axis of the unit, and biases the closure unit to its normally closed      article receiving position. Once the container has been filled, the      closure is forced or rotated to its closed position, such that curved      closure portion 40 extends over the opening 30, and lock tabs 48 on an      upper portion of the closure panel 36 extend into and lock into lock slots      or sockets 50, forming in a small horizontal lip at the forward edge of      the housing opening. This essentially permanently locks the container in      its closed position for disposal. </PAR><PAR>  In normal operation, to dispose of a syringe as viewed in FIG. 2, the      syringe is inserted into the top opening, with the needle extending toward      the left to extend inside and underneath the top of the housing, such that      the body of the syringe is placed on the horizontal closure surface 34, as      seen in FIG. 3. The weight of the syringe overcomes the counterweight and      tilts the closure member to dump the syringe into the container, as      illustrated at FIG. 4. At the same time, the closure surface 40 moves      forward and covers the opening 30 to prevent the insertion of a hand or      the like for the removal of articles from the container. </PAR><PAR>  If it is desirable to remove the needle to either reuse the syringe or      prior to disposing of the syringe, a needle removal slot, designed      generally by the numeral 52, is formed in the upper portion of the top for      this purpose. This needle removal slot has a generally tear-drop      configuration converging from a larger diameter at one end to a smaller      diameter at the other. The slot has a pair of opposed tapered side walls      54 and 56, which act as wrench surfaces for engaging the side of a needle      hub for applying torque for unthreading the needle. A pair of opposed      fingernail like edges 58 and 60 are provided at the larger end thereof for      engaging between the threaded end of the shank of the needle and the      syringe body to enable it to be pulled out of the syringe body. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIGS. 5-8, the container is designed for wall mounting by      means of a lockable bracket that is preferably permanently attached to a      wall or suitable wall like structure. The back of the container, as shown      in FIGS. 5 and 6, is provided with a recess having overlapped side      portions 62 and 64 that receive a vertically extending back panel 66      secured to a wall or like vertical surface by means of suitable screws or      the like in a plurality of holes 68. The bracket 66 includes a forwardly      extending support shelf or surface 70, which is formed with a pair of lock      hooks 74 and 76 at the center and at a position closely adjacent the back      panel portion. These finger hooks or locks are designed to receive and      latch to latching fingers 78 and 80 formed at the back end of a channel 82      formed along the bottom of the container. </PAR><PAR>  The channel 82 is designed to receive latch releasing or unlocking key, as      illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9, which comprises a main body member 84 having      a pair of fingers 86 and 88 at a forward end thereof. The fingers are      provided with camming surfaces 90 and 92 that extend downward for engaging      and camming the lock hooks or fingers 74 and 76 out of latching engagement      with latching fingers 78 and 80, as shown in FIG. 9. Thus, the container      can be locked to the support bracket 66, and when ready for disposal or      removal, a key 84 is selected and inserted in the slot 82 for engaging and      releasing the lock or latch. The container can then be removed from the      bracket and disposed of, and a new container mounted. </PAR><PAR>  While I have illustrated and described my invention by means of specific      embodiments, it should be understood that numerous changes and      modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit and      scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. I further assert      and sincerely believe that the above specification contains a written      description of the invention and the manner and process of making and      using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any      person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most      nearly concerned, to make and use the same, and further that it sets forth      the best mode contemplated by me for carrying out the invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
