BulkeleyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> UIS DSN XRXCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   In an action that heralds the spread of a new computer printing technology, Unisys Corp. said it agreed to buy $50 million of ion deposition printers from Delphax Corp., Randolph, Mass.    Delphax, a joint venture owned by Dennison Manufacturing Co., Waltham, Mass., and Xerox Corp., Stamford, Conn., has been selling versions of the new printers for four years, but has captured only a small share of the fast-growing, $3.25 billion market for non-impact printers, which is dominated by laser printers.    The Delphax &quot;technology has been wonderful,&quot; said David Henry Goodstein, president of InterConsult Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm. &quot;The problem for Delphax has been figuring out how to crack the mainstream market. This (Unisys transaction) is the biggest thing so far in helping them do that.&quot;    Under the agreement, Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys, a computer maker, will buy the printers over the next three years, add software and packaging, and resell them as the Unisys B9275 for $82,000 each. The printers will be sold to Unisys customers for high-speed printing at 75 pages a minute in data processing centers and offices. They are expected to replace aging, noisy line-printers and compete with high-speed laser printers made mostly by Xerox and International Business Machines Corp.    Among other effects, the spread of the printers is likely to hasten the demise of that symbol of the computer age -- the fanfold reams of perforated paper with sprocket holes on the side. The Delphax printers handle single sheets of copier paper.    &quot;The technology has come of age,&quot; Thomas J. Kinney, vice president of Delphax, said. &quot;Unisys confirms we've gone from an interesting, novel technology to a real competitor.&quot;    Ion deposition printing was developed in the 1970s by Dennison, a stationery products and label maker, to print bar codes. It formed Delphax to find additional uses for the technology, and since 1983, Delphax has been selling versions of the printers to other companies, including Xerox and Honeywell-Bull Inc., which then resell them. This year, Delphax expects to sell about $42 million of the printers.    The technology involves shooting negatively charged ions, in patterns that form letters and graphics, onto an anodized aluminum roller that attracts magnetic toner to the charged areas. The roller then crushes the toner into the paper to print on it.    Delphax and independent consultants say that the technology is less expensive and more reliable than laser printers, because the paper moves in a shorter path, reducing jams, and the printer has about one-third the number of moving parts of a laser printer. It is also nearly silent and it doesn't use heat to melt the toner onto the paper as laser printers do. A Unisys spokesman said, &quot;In general, we believe ion deposition is more reliable, more maintainable, with less mean-time between stops than a photoelectric-type system.&quot;    The printing technique, which Delphax said is thoroughly protected by patents, doesn't yet allow the very high-quality printing provided by laser printers. But Mr. Goodstein, the consultant, said quality is likely to improve as more fonts are developed for the ion deposition printers; a font is a complete assortment of type in one size and style. The toner sometimes flakes off when the paper is creased. And the paper often looks shiny because it has been crushed by the roller.    Cathernie Dingman, an analyst with CAP International Inc., a Marshfield, Mass., market research concern, predicted that ion deposition printers will capture a big piece of the market for non-impact printers, especially for forms, reports and other internal documents. &quot;I don't think we're talking about half the market, but in some niches, they might get 40%,&quot; she said.    Michael Winkler, Xerox vice president, central printing, said that currently he sees high-speed laser printers and the somewhat slower, lower-quality ion deposition printers as &quot;complementary. In the early 1990s, as both technologies advance, we are going to see more competition. We are hedging our bets&quot; by sharing ownership of Delphax.    But ion deposition isn't ever likely to compete in the market against desktop laser printers based on Japanese copier technology that cost less than $10,000. </TEXT></DOC>
