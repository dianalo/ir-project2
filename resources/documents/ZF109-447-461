Smith andamp; Associates, in 1986.andM;The seminar was held at the financial district (really Chinatown) HolidayInn.andP;  The accommodations were adequate.andP;  There were 35 students -- includingone who had come all the way from Saudi Arabia for this course.andM;The registration fee was $995.andM;THE DATA RESOURCE CONCEPTandM;E/R modeling is experiencing &quot;explosive growth!&quot;andM;E/R modeling is:andM;* &quot;a powerful analytic tool.&quot;andM;* a means of achieving &quot;a little data in and a lot of understanding out.&quot;andM;* &quot;a technique for observing a business in a different way.&quot;andM;* &quot;for noun-thinkers instead of verb-thinkers.&quot;andM;* a subset of information resource management (IRM).andP;  It is &quot;a new way ofperceiving and managing the information resources of a business.&quot;andM;&quot;The essence of E/R is to capture meaning.&quot;andP;  &quot;Most companies suffer from toomuch data and not the right data.&quot;andP;  &quot;They think in terms of lines-of-code,not data!&quot;andM;Data is a resource.andP;  As with other company resources, it must be forecast,allocated, and its use must be optimized.andM;Traditional data processing is wasteful and ineffective.andP;  It exists inseparate &quot;systems&quot; that are not integrated and, in fact, results in&quot;gridlock&quot; when users try to cross boundaries.andM;&quot;Mainframes are used by many people at the same time.andP;  Their use is shared.andO;Data too, must be shared.&quot;andM;Many companies today support a variety of separate, independent systems thatare costly and ineffective/inefficient.andP;  &quot;The next ten years will be spenttearing them apart.andP;  We need: simpler, cheaper, and better!&quot;andP;  To correct thesituation will take &quot;capital and will!andP;  You have to dive in and fix it!&quot;andO;Don't wait until the problems become so painfully obvious that everyoneagrees &quot;it's broke.&quot;andP;  Do it now!andM;According to the class notes, &quot;the data resource concept&quot; is:andM;* one fact in one placeandM;* shared by all applications and usersandM;* updating is synchronized and automaticandM;* data flows into and out of the databaseandM;* security and integrity are controlledandM;* &quot;it collapses the information float.&quot; (redundancy and waste are eliminated)andM;&quot;It's like a big E-mail box.&quot;andP;  Bill Smith warned that in order for E-mail towork well, &quot;the messages must be clear.andP;  Meaning must be established or thereis danger of misinterpretation.&quot;andM;The instructor warned that adopting IRM (information resource management)concepts will result in a &quot;culture change&quot; from traditional data processingmethodologies.andM;Any company willing to make the dramatic change must also be willing toaccept:andM;1.andP;  the need for a CIO (chief information officer) to provide leadership andguarantee executive involvement.andM;- company policy issues and political issues will need resolutionandM;- some issues will cross organizational boundariesandM;2.andP;  the need for &quot;information management general policies,&quot; i.e., writtenrules governing the handling of data.andM;3.andP;  the construction and enforcement of resource models.andP;  Including:andM;- a functional model of the businessandM;- a conceptual data model (a &quot;blue print&quot;)andM;- a conceptual process modelandM;- a distribution model (fixing location)andM;- a technology model (fixing equipment)andM;4.andP;  the need for an implementation/migration plan.andM;- defining projects and sequence of implementationandM;5.andP;  an organizational transformation.andM;- a data-oriented organization will have to be addedandM;6.andP;  an investment in training and/or retraining.andM;DATA RESOURCE MODELINGandM;The set of models this instructor recommends consists of three design modelsand four implementation models.andM;* Design modelsandM;1.andP;  A functional model of the domain.andM;- The domain could consist of the entire enterprise or some sub-section.andM;- Doing the entire enterprise takes longer and costs more, but Mr. Smithclaims that it will result in the most rewards.andM;2.andP;  A &quot;conceptual data model,&quot; which is the E/R model and defines the dataneeds.andM;- This is derived from the information in the model of the domain.andM;- This model and the following model exchange processing and datarequirements.andM;3.andP;  A &quot;conceptual transaction model,&quot; which defines the processingrequirements.andM;* Implementation modelsandM;1.andP;  A &quot;logical data model&quot;andM;2.andP;  A &quot;logical transaction model&quot;andM;3.andP;  A &quot;physical data model&quot;andM;4.andP;  A &quot;physical process model&quot;andM;Upon completion of the models, coding can begin.andM;E/R CONCEPTSandM;He used an analogy: a database is like a supermarket.andP;  There are a variety ofways to stock the shelves.andP;  Some provide more convenience to the shoppersthan do others.andP;  &quot;You could stock them according to the needs in a recipebook so everything you need for a particular recipe is together.andP;  Then youmove to the next recipe in the book and do the same thing.&quot;andP;  That would beextremely convenient for those few shoppers who wanted to make those recipes.andO;But it would result in milk being in dozens of locations (hard to maintain)and if you wanted to make a different recipe, it would be difficult to locateanything.andP;  For most shoppers, it would be extremely inconvenient.andM;If you stock the shelves by categories -- dairy, produce, meat -- and then bysubcategories -- milk, eggs, poultry, etc.andP;  -- any shopper can find anything(well, almost).andM;If your databases are set up to accommodate particular system needs, theywill be inconvenient for non-system needs.andM;The goal of E/R is to stock your database the way the supermarket stocks itsshelves: convenient for all users (though less convenient for a few), easy tomaintain (update), and easy to add new items.andM;&quot;The ingredients are there, the raw materials are available.andP;  You can cookthe way you want, you can make any recipe you want.&quot;andP;  Remember: &quot;You can'toptimize for everyone!&quot;andM;An interesting point: &quot;Vendors are not involved in the way you stock yourdatabase.&quot;andP;  In fact, some vendor packages become less attractive because theyrequire certain data structures.andP;  Bill reported that software houses are nowtaking E/R into account and producing new packages that permit tailoringtheir software to accommodate your database.andM;As the number of your &quot;sharable, subject-oriented databases increases, thecost to develop applications and/or perform information retrievalsdecreases.&quot;andM;He again warned that in order to reap the benefits of &quot;sharable&quot; data, itmust be convenient for the greatest number of users.andP;  There will be smallgroups who will want their data to be segregated and optimized for their use.andO;Avoid doing that.andP;  Provide benefit for the masses.andM;The method for achieving these honorable goals: &quot;PLAN!andP;  Don't wing it.!&quot;andM;If you were building a house, which method would you prefer your builder touse:andM;A.andP;  Have the suppliers dump piles of all the materials you are likely to needand say to the workmen, &quot;O.K.andP;  guys, start building.andP;  We'll fix the problemsas we find them.&quot;andM;B.andP;  Have an architect draw plans that you can approve before constructionbegins -- and then have the builder follow the approved plans.andM;Some database builders (and software developers) use method &quot;A.&quot;andP;  E/Rmodeling requires method &quot;B.&quot;andM;BEGINNING THE PROCESSandM;Having decided to proceed with IRM (information resource management), thefirst step is to decide how to stock the shelves -- what categories will youuse?andM;To make those decisions, you have to involve representatives from all thegroups that will be affected.andP;  Bill advocates the&quot;all-in-one-room-at-the-same-time&quot; principle.andP;  &quot;It's faster, cheaper, andmore effective.&quot;andP;  If you can't get &quot;all,&quot; come as close as you can.andP;  You needconsensus -- agreement.andP;  And that ain't always easy!andP;  Be aware that the taskcan not be partitioned.andP;  Everyone has to agree.andP;  &quot;Work it out while it'scheap and easy -- on a blackboard.andP;  Don't wait until [the database] has beenbuilt before you tackle these problems.&quot;andM;Data modeling was defined as &quot;a set of techniques for organizing data intoits most natural (subject) form, which maximizes its usefulness,shareability, stability, and flexibility, while minimizing the cost andeffort to maintain it.&quot;andM;These premises were accepted as given:andM;* Data is a valuable resource.andM;* Most data is highly sharable.andM;* Sharing/utilizing data more effectively is a critical success factor formost businesses.andM;* Subject organization is most effective for sharing.andM;CAN COMMENT: Accepting those premises is tantamount to accepting the IRMconcepts.andP;  If you accept them, get ready for some big changes.andM;Here is the set of conceptual modeling definitions, provided by theinstructor, that determine E/R modeling:andM;* Entity = a person, place, thing, concept, or event about which a businesscares enough to keep data.andM;* Relationship = a named business association between occurrences of one ormore entity types, which provides some relevant information value.andM;* Attribute = a data fact about an entity or relation.andM;* Occurrence = A single instance of an entity type, relationship type, orattribute type.andM;* Entity/relationship (E/R) model = the conceptual model of business subjectmatter consisting of a diagram (showing the structural organization ofentities, relationships, and attributes), and formal policy-based definitionsof each -- usually stored in a dictionary.andM;- &quot;Don't get obsessed with drawing pictures!andP;  The definitions are moreimportant than the diagram.andP;  The definitions are the most important part.&quot;andM;* Domain = an arbitrary boundary defined to limit the scope of an E/R model.andM;CAN COMMENT: Please note that these definitions exist in precise -- andwritten -- form.andP;  The significance of that will be addressed in the&quot;Conclusions&quot; section below.andM;Bill also provided definitions for process modeling:andM;* Conceptual transaction = the smallest indivisible unit of processingrequired to complete a valid create, update or delete operation against thedatabase, or to deliver a complete unit of information to the business(retrieve).andM;* Logical transaction (the next level of detail) = the information in theconceptual transaction, but defined in terms of how the transaction will actupon specific data elements.andP;  (This is a complete specification of allinput/output and procedural logic.)andM;What those definitions imply is that organizing the data (data modeling) isdifferent from using the data (process modeling).andP;  To use the data, you needCRUD -- the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete data.andP;  If thedata is stored in its simplest form -- as is the intent of E/R modeling --then the code needed for processing will be greatly simplified and highlyreusable.andP;  (That is where you reap that benefit.andP;  Not only is the datashared, but so is the code to do CRUD operations.)andM;More specifically, these are your benefits:andM;* from using subject-oriented data:andM;- stability -- less vulnerable to business change (it is stored in itssimplest form)andM;- flexibility -- easier to make changes (less disruption of all the unchangeddata)andM;- reduced redundancy -- saving time, effort, and spaceandM;- improved integrity/consistency/timelinessandM;- shareability -- build once, use manyandM;* CRUD-oriented processesandM;- stability -- less vulnerable to business changesandM;- flexibility/modularity -- easier to make business changesandM;- reduced redundancy -- saving time, effort, and spaceandM;- improved integrity/consistencyandM;- shareability -- build once, use manyandM;When the data and the code to process that data are shared, the cost goesdown.andP;  When additional users are permitted to share the data, there is noadditional cost.andM;MODEL THE BUSINESSandM;When constructing your models, it is imperative that they reflect thebusiness accurately.andP;  There is a danger that computer people willunconsciously skew the model to accommodate computations.andP;  But, &quot;90% of allcomputer usage today is data manipulation, not computation.&quot;andP;  Another danger(emanating from techy-types) is to forcibly incorporate the latest technologywhiz-bang.andM;The basic elements of E/R modeling are (now, don't be too surprised!)andO;entities and relationships.andP;  In plain English, they are the nouns and verbsthat define and describe the business -- in the simplest terms possible.andM;There are six stringent (well, five are stringent and the sixth iswishy-washy) rules governing the declaration of an &quot;entity.&quot;andP;  To qualify asan entity, something must:andM;1.andP;  be a person, place, thing, concept, or event.andM;2.andP;  be something the business has both the means and will to collect dataaboutandM;3.andP;  be nameable with a singular noun which names one occurrence of theentity.andM;4.andP;  be uniquely identifiable.andM;5.andP;  be mutually exclusive from all other entities in the domain (exceptsubtypes).andM;6.andP;  be relatively equal in importance to other entities in the domain.andP;  (Thisis entirely subjective.andP;  the point is: it something is relativelyunimportant, don't waste time and effort treating it as though it wereimportant.andP;  Bill said some E/R schools omit this rule.)andM;Example of probable entities in your business are: employee, customer,vendor, order, product type, equipment item, account, organizational unit.andO;Depending on the type of your business, you will have different entities:andM;* a hospital might have &quot;bed&quot; and &quot;room&quot;andM;* an insurance company might have &quot;policy&quot; and &quot;location&quot;andM;* an airline might have &quot;flight&quot; and &quot;maintenance type&quot;andM;Even within the same business type, individual companies will have uniqueentities that describe their business and their way of doing business.andM;The model builder must identify the entities that will be used for thiscompany.andP;  Bill said, in most companies, the model builder can identify theneeded entities.andP;  Investigation found that:andM;* 30% are generic, typical, observable, and obviousandM;* 30% are industry-specific, more abstract, not always observable -- you haveto delve deeper to detect themandM;* 30% are environment-specific, very abstract, obscure -- it takes rigorousanalysis to detect themandM;* 10% are so obscure their existence will only be discovered during modeling-- when they are noted by their absence -- or will never be discoveredandM;&quot;You do not need 100% of the entities to build a good, workable model!andP;  The80/20 rule applies: 80% of the usage will be from 20% of the entities -- andthey are the ones in the top two categories.&quot;andP;  He claims that, though more isbetter, a workable model can be constructed from only 60% of the possibleentities.andM;&quot;A model is sculpted, it is created.andP;  It is not copied.&quot;andM;An interesting aside: some entities that seem obvious are not.andP;  When workingwith an airline, he found that &quot;flight&quot; was not an entity that everybodyagreed upon.andP;  To the marketing people, a flight was completely defined by aflight number.andP;  To the operations people -- who must assign aircraft and crew-- a flight can only be defined by flight number and date.andP;  He resolved theproblem by making two entities because, to the users, they were two separateitems.andM;There was a short exercise to see if the students could identify entities.andO;It proved that analysis is required.andP;  To be an entity, the candidate mustadhere to all six rules stated above.andP;  Example: to an automobilemanufacturer, an individual automobile is an entity -- they will keep data onit.andP;  To a cookie manufacturer, an individual cookie is not an entity -- but a&quot;batch&quot; is.andM;Diagrams are used to describe the relationships among entities.andO;Relationships, too, are governed by rules.andM;Relationships must:andM;1.andP;  be an important association between occurrences of one or more entitieswhich provide some relevant business information.andM;2.andP;  be something the business has both the means and the will to capture andstore.andM;3.andP;  be uniquely and neutrally named -- using &quot;soft&quot; verb forms (-ing, -tion,-ment, -al, -ship, etc.) which capture the meaning of the relationship.andM;4.andP;  be static -- a state of being.andP;  Not directional and not a process.andO;(Example: if the entities are &quot;student&quot; and &quot;class,&quot; the relationship couldbe &quot;attending.&quot;andP;  That is, the student attends class and the class is attendedby the student -- bi-directional.andP;  It does not refer to a particularstudent's action of sitting in class on a particular day.)andM;5.andP;  be mutually exclusive -- not redundant.andM;Relationships may:andM;1.andP;  contain data attributes (information about the data, or additional data.andO;Note: There are different schools of modeling -- some disallow attributes onrelationships.)andM;2.andP;  represent past, present, and/or future states of relatedness.andM;In addition to specifying the entities and relationships, the diagram alsodocuments rules of occurrence -- called &quot;cardinality notations&quot; -- specifyinghow many occurrences are possible (zero, one, or many) between the entity andthe relationship.andP;  Example: a student may attend many (n) classes but a classcannot be taught by zero instructors.andM;These cardinal rules are based on business considerations.andP;  They reflect aparticular company's way of doing business -- and will be heavily used inprocess specification.andM;CAN COMMENT: In some ways, they are analogous to the rules in AI.andP;  Theylimit, control, and just plain make sense out of the E/R interactions.andM;At the time of data creation, &quot;they are forces for data validation.&quot;andM;The combined rules for entities, relationship, and cardinality notationcomprise the bases for E/R modeling.andP;  Once you understand them (theinstructor kept drilling us in them, forcing us to memorize them) you areready to begin sculpting an entity/relationship model.andM;BUILDING A MODELandM;A full two days of the three day class were spent building models.andP;  Each stepwas explained, demonstrated, and we were given the opportunity to practice --and ask questions as we went.andP;  This was a &quot;how to&quot; seminar.andP;  It was not justtheory, it was practical experience.andP;  There were class exercises and homeworkassignments.andM;So much time was devoted to this one aspect of the overall process of IRMbecause:andM;* it was the purpose of the course (!)andM;* it is so important to everything that would follow in a practicalapplication of IRMandM;The E/R model is the blueprint for everything that follows.andP;  If there areerrors or misinterpretations in the blueprint, they will be carried forth inthe finished product.andP;  It is much easier and cheaper to correct errors in themodel -- you just draw new boxes -- than to recode sections of the finishedproduct.andM;There are two popular notation methods for E/R modeling: Chen and Bachman(named after their authors).andP;  Some CASE tools are available for either.andO;&quot;None of the CASE tools are really good!&quot;andP;  Jim prefers using the Chen method,so that is the one he taught.andM;We were taught the various box shapes, line segments, arrows, etc.andP;  and thenames and applications of the variety of techniques: recursive relationships,N-ary relationships, subtype/supertype, associative entities, etc, etc, etc!andM;CAN COMMENT: Each of the many variations made sense and we could see where itcould be applied.andP;  We were able to see that any business interaction could bemodeled by using the correct combination of notations.andM;We also learned that &quot;correct&quot; is a relative term.andP;  In modeling, some thingsare definitely &quot;wrong,&quot; some ways of depicting an occurrence are better thanothers, but there is no &quot;perfect&quot; way.andP;  The sculptor has latitude -- whichmeans, there are constantly decisions to be made.andP;  This course attempted toteach us how to analyze the needs and make the decisions.andM;A case study -- an imaginary video tape rental store -- was carried thoughthe course.andP;  Our &quot;grand exercise&quot; was to build a model of the companyinvolving all the activities likely to be found there.andP;  As we examined themany different activities involved in running that business, we began toappreciate the complexity inherent to all business -- even small ones likevideo stores.andP;  Interestingly, we were able to reflect all that complexity inan E/R model that contained only 12 entities and 13 relationships.andP;  When thesimple model was complete, we could trace any activity needed to run thebusiness.andM;Then, we were challenged to ask any question that might be of interest to thecompany management and see if we could obtain the answer from the data in themodel.andP;  Examples: Which tapes were reserved most in the last month?andP;  (Thatmight indicate we need more copies.)andP;  Which tapes required maintenancebecause of customer complaints and which vendors were they purchased from?andM;(That might influence our choice of vendors.)andP;  Which customers requested thenew tape that just arrived?andP;  (We want to inform them that it is availablenow.)andM;Dozens of questions were asked, all could be answered from our model.andP;  Theinstructor had proven that a very finite -- in fact, small -- model cananswer an infinite number of questions if, and only if, it has beenconstructed properly and completely.andM;DEFINITIONSandM;&quot;Definitions take longer than diagramming -- but they are important!&quot;andM;Each entity and relationship in the model must have a formal -- and written-- definition.andM;Determining those definitions &quot;exposes semantic, procedural, and policyconflicts, gaps, and controversies.&quot;andP;  The example of the differentinterpretation of &quot;flight&quot; by marketing and operations people is an exampleof the unsuspected problems that can arise.andM;The definitions should be written in language that will be understood by anew employee -- no jargon, acronyms, etc.andP;  The definitions must be bothsimple and precise.andP;  The collection of definitions are then placed in aformal dictionary which can be considered a legal document because it may beso interpreted in subsequent usage.andM;You will have to decide how much information you will capture and maintain inthe written definitions.andP;  Each definition statement should include at least:andM;* The entity nameandM;- That will be the official name.andP;  It must be unique.andM;* An abbreviated version of the name.andM;- That will be used in the diagram.andP;  It must be unique.andM;* The definitionandM;- It must be precise and agreed upon by the users.andM;* Policy statementsandM;- Pertinent company statements of policy should be included for both clarityand possible legal implications.andP;  Example: if the entity is &quot;employee,&quot;precisely when does a person become an employee?andM;* The primary key that will be used to reference this entityandM;- It must adhere to company standards.andM;* Time-frame statementandM;- Does the data pertain only to the present?andP;  Or will past and future bestored here as well?andM;* The rules for creating the entityandM;- Clearly stated rules will simplify the programing task.andM;* The rules for deleting the entityandM;* The organization holding custody for this entityandM;- The named organization will control the rules for creating and deleting theentity and will be responsible for its accuracy.andM;It is also necessary to formally define each &quot;relationship.&quot;andP;  Thosedefinitions should include the rules for cardinality.andM;Establishing these definitions is both important and difficult.andO;Misunderstandings and ambiguities will be discovered.andP;  (Remember theconfusion over the definition of &quot;flight.&quot;)  Bill suggests having a formalprocedure to resolve those problems -- including a mechanism to getmanagement approval and &quot;sign-off.&quot;andM;Do not underestimate the importance of the formal, written definitions.andO;Drawing the model is the sexy part, but having the collection of definitionsis what gives the model its power.andM;REVIEW AND VERIFYandM;Because it is easy and cheap to change the model but difficult and expensiveto change the finished product, find the problems NOW.andP;  Review.andP;  Question.andO;Challenge.andM;One way to verify the model is to attempt to use it to answer questions.andP;  Igave examples of the class getting answers to management questions from ourmodel of the video rental store.andP;  Use your model the same way.andP;  Ask questionsto see if they can be answered by the data in your model.andP;  If you can'tanswer a question -- and it's a logical question -- fix the model.andM;CAN COMMENT: Inventing the questions can be an enlightening and excitingexperience.andP;  You may discover whole new areas of information that areavailable but, as yet, unused.andM;At this point, the most helpful role you can play is devil's advocate.andM;AND PLAN FOR THE FUTUREandM;When you are satisfied that the model meets your present needs, immediatelystart planning for the future.andP;  The goal is to insert flexibility into themodel in those areas where change can be anticipated.andP;  The instructor'sadvice: Call a meeting of some of the people within the company who are mostknowledgeable about the company's operation and future plans.andP;  Note: thesepeople do not need to know about IRM, E/R modeling, or computers.andP;  It's theirbusiness knowledge that is important.andP;  Have the group consider areas that maychange -- and thereby change the company's way of doing business.andP;  Candidatetopics include:andM;* your productsandM;* your servicesandM;* your competitors' products and servicesandM;} your customersandM;* expansions, acquisitions, mergers, etc.andM;* internal management policiesandM;* laws/regulationsandM;* your organizational structureandM;* technologyandM;Jointly, the group should hypothesize possible changes to the businessenvironment and evaluate the probability of each change actually occurring.andO;(Bill said he has witnessed some &quot;wild&quot; scenes during these sessions.andP;  Peoplethink of possibilities that never had been considered.)andM;Later, you analyze the results.andP;  &quot;Evaluate the impact on the model.andP;  Decidechanges to the model for immunity from the most probable/severe changes.&quot;andO;Bill warned against attempting to make the model too flexible.andP;  There arediminishing returns.andP;  Each time you add flexibility, you decrease efficiency.andM;The goal is to be ready and able to &quot;adapt with grace.&quot;andM;CONCLUSIONSandM;The big question: Is E/R modeling a passing fad?andP;  I think not.andP;  We reportedon object-oriented development (see CAN 247) and concluded that the conceptsare ephemeral (to put it politely) and on CASE (see CANs 224 and 234)products are ephemeral (to put it bluntly).andM;IRM and E/R modeling are different.andP;  They have been with us for a while --Bill told us of a company he had assisted in its use in 1979.andP;  They haveprecise rules, and there are companies who have successfully embraced themand successfully used them.andP;  They have a track record.andM;My conclusion: E/R modeling is a technology/technique that is worthy of yourinvestigation.andM;Be aware that if you embrace it, the many benefits will be accompanied bythese costs:andM;* Your staff will need training.andP;  In my opinion, just reading about it wouldbe insufficient.andP;  Your staff will need a live instructor, practice,exercises, and the capability of asking questions will be essential.andP;  Onecourse, such as this, is necessary but insufficient.andP;  There is more to itthan drawing models.andP;  This course, by design -- as well as time limitations-- does not touch implementation.andP;  For information on complete IRM training,contact TTI (213-394-8305), William G. Smith andamp; Associates (208-524-6376), orthe training organization of your choice.andM;* Implementing IRM will be a radical changes from traditional DP.andP;  Thatchange will disrupt your current tranquility (if it exists).andM;* There may be resistance.andP;  (What!andP;  Share MY data!andP;  Let them get their owndata!andP;  You mean MY data is no longer going to be in MY special format that ismost convenient to ME?)andM;It is interesting to note that many of the students were not only familiarwith E/R modeling but were already using it in their jobs.andP;  They attendedthis class to sharpen their skills, to &quot;see how a professional does it,&quot; andto ask questions.andP;  (Reasonable motives.)andP;  From that, we can deduce that theyhave accepted the concept and have found it worth-while.andP;  Their companieswere willing to invest in their trip to increase their skills.andP;  Thatconstitutes testimonials from those companies.andM;Talking to some of the students, I found that they were enthusiastic aboutthis class.andP;  They were pleased with Bill Smith as an instructor and felt thatthe class had been valuable to them.andM;If you are unfamiliar with the basic concepts of IRM, look into it.andP;  If youare familiar with IRM, investigate its use to improve your control over yourcompany's data.andP;  If you are already using IRM, let me know the level of yoursatisfaction.andP;  If IRM is as good as it sounds, why isn't everybody using it?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
