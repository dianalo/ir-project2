Protesters gathered outside Parliament, voicing objections to thepact on the world's last relatively unexplored frontier. Antarcticais thought to contain large mineral deposits.   Environmental organizations including the group Greenpeace wantthe continent turned into a world park, suggesting a fight formineral resources could ignite a major military conflict.   The countries that signed the treaty were Brazil, Finland, SouthKorea, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, the Soviet Union, Uruguay andNew Zealand, said an official for Foreign Minister Russell Marshall.   Chile, the United States, Argentina and Britain made a commitmentto sign in the near future, the official said. The spokesmandeclined to be identified, as is customary.   The Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral ResourceActivities was adopted by Antarctic Treaty countries in June aftersix years of negotiations.   U.S. ambassador to New Zealand, Paul Cleveland, said the pact wasa ``landmark agreement in the fields of resource management andenvironmental protection.''   The agreement ``reinforces the overall objectives of theAntarctic Treaty which ensured that the southernmost region of ourplanet is free of conflict or military activity of any kind.''   Cleveland said the agreement did not prejudge whether mineralresource activities would or should take place. He said it set outthe process by which such activities would be considered and howdecisions would be made.   Rigorous environmental requirements had to be satisfied beforeany Antarctic mineral resource activity could be authorized orcarried out, he added.</TEXT></DOC>
