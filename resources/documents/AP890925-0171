But investigators from France,Chad and Niger still sought clues in debris scattered over a remotearea more than five miles long and a mile wide.   Robert Paillasse, head of the investigation commission, told aFrench TV interviewer he was sure an ``explosive substance'' in afront cargo compartment caused the crash, but that it has not yetbeen positively identified as a bomb.   Paillasse said laboratory tests on wreckage are proceeding inParis to find out ``from the traces of combustion, which explosivematerial was involved.''   The plane exploded at an altitude of 30,000 feet about an hourafter taking off from N'Djamena, Chad, for Paris. Wreckage of theUTA airline plane was scattered over the Tenere desert inneighboring Niger, one of the most inaccessible spots on earth.   In Paris, judicial sources said Investigating MagistrateJean-Louis Bruguieres officially asked France's counterespionagepolice _ the Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire, or DST _to aid in the probe.   Bruguieres, an anti-terrorism specialist, heads the criminalinvestigation.   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.   Various unidentified callers to news media in Beirut and Parisclaimed responsibility for the crash, but none was verified. Thecalls included the previously unknown Secret Chadian Resistance andthe Islamic Jihad, which is believed to hold Western hostages inLebanon.   A Foreign Ministry spokesman declined to say precisely how manybodies had been recovered when he announced abandonment of thesearch on Monday.   ``In the heat of the desert _ which averages ... (122 degrees) _it is very unlikely that any parts of bodies may still be found. Wehave searched the area very thoroughly, and brought back anythingthat resembled human remains,'' he said, speaking on condition ofanonymity in keeping with government policy.   ``All the bodies and parts of bodies have been transported toParis, where the Judicial-Medical Research Institute will try toidentify them. Autopsies will be performed, but we do not expect tobe able to identify more than about 100 of the bodies.''   So far, only the bodies of the pilot and co-pilot and a fewother people recognizable by uniforms or distinctive marks havebeen positively identified, he said.   The plane was flying precisely along its scheduled route, andpreliminary analysis of flight data showed all systems on boardfailed at the same instant, indicating an explosion.</TEXT></DOC>
