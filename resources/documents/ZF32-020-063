(thread archives on DBADVISOR Forum)</TITLE><AUTHOR>House, Bill.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>CompuServe users can find the answers to many of theirdatabase-related questions on the DBADVISOR Forum's threadarchives.andP;  Product technical support as well as general interestthreads are compiled into different categories by subject andmessage.andP;  The Forum has a vast amount of information on productsso they have been broken down into the following categories: allX-Base related technical postings, technical support for Randamp;RReport Writer Edition, technical support for R:BASE Edition and aconsultant's section on technical support, taxes, contracts, fees,etc.andP;  Users will find that they can obtain valuable informationeasily by using DBAVIEW to search for the topics that interestthem.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer Bulletin BoardsSupport ServicesCompuServe (Videotex system)VideotexInformation Services.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Have you ever wished you didn't have to ask a question?andP;  You know, the typeof question that's certain to have been asked before, one that gives you that&quot;Haven't I been here before?&quot; feeling.andP;  I've been on both sides of that coinand now there may be help on the horizon.andM;Recently, a new resource has become available on the Forum: thread archives.andO;Thousands of messages of interest and product technical support threads havebeen compiled into categories, by thread subject and message.andP;  They'reavailable, in both ASCII and DBF format, in Section 1 of the DBADVISOR Forum,as are periodic updates.andP;  Download THDARC.TXT for a list of the filenames.andM;For those of you with IBM-compatibles, a free thread-viewing program,DBAVIEW.EXE, is also available for download.andP;  It provides the followingbenefits:andM;* Organizes threads into a menu-driven outlineandM;* Makes topics easy to find by navigating the outlineandM;* Allows retrieval of messages containing and word or group of wordsandM;* Merges downloaded updates into the archive databaseandM;* Does it all pretty fast (if I may say so)andM;Make the most of the ForumandM;Literally hundreds of messages are posted weekly.andP;  The sheer volume isstaggering, but what about the value of this information?andP;  If you're like me,you've probably already committed several megabytes of disk space to CISthreads.andP;  Ask yourself, &quot;Is it worth the disk space?&quot;andM;Of course it is!andP;  Especially if you have it stored in the right way--in adatabase application program.andM;A matter of timeandM;For example, suppose you want to know about payroll tax information.andP;  Findingit with DBAVIEW is easy.andP;  Just run the program, select &quot;Database&quot; from themenu, hit Ctrl-S for &quot;Search,&quot; and type &quot;payroll tax.&quot;andP;  You'll get a picklistof messages.andP;  For this particular search, which takes about a second on mymachine, seven messages are returned out of 3,000.andP;  They contain no less thanthree sources of payroll tax information, including state and local taxesnationwide.andP;  It would be misleading to say that answers to all your questionswill be provided so quickly and completely, but some of them will be.andM;What gets archivedandM;The decision has so far been left to me, with valuable help from fellowSysops and the DBA staff.andP;  Product-oriented tech tips are obvious must-haves,but I've also tried to include technology and issue-oriented discussions.andO;I'm open to suggestion, but the best way to influence the contents of thearchives is to post interesting and informative messages.andP;  Leave somethingbehind for posterity--it's also fun!andM;Special editionsandM;Since so many products are represented on the Forum, and for the benefit ofthose who only want a technical support resource, special editions areavailable.andP;  They've been chosen on the basis of message volume, as well astechnical content:andM;* X-Base Edition--all X-Base related technical messages.andM;* Randamp;R Report Writer Edition--tech support.andM;* R:BASE Edition--tech support.andM;* Consultant's Technical Edition--tech support, plus info on contracts,taxes, pricing, etc.andM;These editions omit non-technical discussion, allowing members to save onconnect charges.andP;  As with the main threads database, these editions will beupdated periodically.andP;  Other editions will be added as sufficient volume andcontent quality accumulate.andP;  TH-DARC.TXT will always contain the lattestlisting.andM;Personalized referenceandM;databaseandM;The combination of topical editions, periodic updates, and DBAVIEW will allowyou to develop reference databases containing just the information you'reinterest in, and economizing on download time and disk space.andP;  Also, if youalready use the thread-archiving software from the FOXFORUM, DBA threads areprovided in MEMOVIEW-compatible FoxPro DBF's.andM;Credit where it's dueandM;DBAVIEW was written by yours truly in C, using Sequiter Software's Code-base4.22, Index Applications' Fast Text Search for C, and compiled with Borland'sC++ compiler.andP;  It uses dBASE IV-compatible DBF, DBT, and NDX files.andP;  Manythanks to the very patient technical support folks and fine programmers ofthese vendors, whose products made DBAVIEW possible, and fellow Sysops andthe DBA staff, whose suggestions made it useable.andM;My favorite threadandM;There have been many great ones, lately, but the following exchange probablyepitomizes the incredible resource that the DBA Forum represents:andM;#: 37057 SO/General Information Sb: Getting Started Fm: Mark To: ALLandM;Hello!!andP;  I'm new to Compuserve.andP;  I purchased this service because I'mseriously considering starting a database design company aimed at smallservice-oriented companies, and felt that it would be good to be connectedwith an excellent information service.andM;I have many questions that need to be answered before I decide to take theplunge, and I thought here would be a good place to ask them.andP;  For example,what are the going rates around the country, and southwestern Ohiospecifically?andP;  Do you charge by the hour, by the program, or a combination?andO;What do you think the best SQL-based database is?andP;  (I'm familiar with Oracle,but open to others for consideration.)andM;These are just a few questions to introduce myself and get a ball rolling.andP;  Ithank you all for your time and patience in advance.andP;  I hope we all have along and fruitful relationship.andM;#: 37066 SO/General Information Sb: #37057-#Getting Started Fm: Sysop BillHouse 76711,246 To: MarkandM;Welcome to the Forum!andP;  Yes, you've come to the right place--I'm sure ourmembers will be happy to provide you with the feedback you need.andM;You might try asking Karen Watterson, our Client/Server editor, about whichSQL products she favors.andP;  I'm just a lowly X-Base programmer, so I can'treally comment.andP;  As for rates, well, that depends a lot on the local market.andO;In L.A.andP;  and N.Y., $125 an hour isn't uncommon.andP;  The market in your area maybe quite different.andP;  One way to arrive at a rate is to take what you get paidas an employee (doing the same work) and triple it (to cover the cost ofdoing business).andM;BTW, you might want to read an article called &quot;Put It In Writing,&quot; by PatAdams.andP;  She did a very good job on it, but, unfortunately, I can't seem tolocate which issue (perhaps someone will chime in with this).andP;  I did find ourMarch 1991 issue, however, which focuses on the consulting secrets of severalsuccessful computer consultants.andP;  Also, Editor, John Hawkins, publishes avery useful newsletter, &quot;Consulting Insider.&quot;andM;#: 37090 SO/General Information Sb: #37057-Getting Started Fm: John Hawkinsandlsqb;DBA] 75300,575 To: MarkandM;The best place to ask this sort of question is in section 10,&quot;Consulting/-Business.&quot;andM;Pricing is among the most complex issues a consultant faces, since it's allthat separates you from starvation1 andless;gandgt; Pricing by the hour protects you, butclients don't like it because it's open-ended.andP;  Pricing by the projectprotects the client but can bury you in unbilled time.andP;  Pricing low gets jobsbut limits your potential.andP;  Pricing high loses jobs but makes you good moneywhen you do work.andM;As Bill said, multiply your salary as an employee to get a ballpark billingrate.andP;  Remember that you'll be billing only about half your time (or less),since marketing and administration take a big chunk.andM;Also, be very sure you understand how the IRS views you as an employee orindependent contractor.andP;  This is not as simple as it sounds, and can subjectyou and your clients to large tax liability if you do it wrong.andM;#: 37131 SO/General Information Sb: #37057-Getting Started Fm: LarryHeimendinger 71660, 1221 To: MarkandM;Welcome to CIS.andP;  Your questions are well put, and you should visit some otherforums where folks do what you're proposing with specific products.andP;  Thethree I'd specifically recommended are Nantucket (NANFORUM), Fox, andBorland.andP;  Their respective products for your activity are Clipper.andP;  FoxPro,and Paradox.andM;Without argument from anyone, I belive, Clipper has the largest third-partymarketplace.andP;  It's my opinion they also have the largest independentconsultant base.andP;  There are many, of course, who use all three products, butClipper is normally chosen for higher-end applications.andP;  It has an openarchitecture, is a compiler/linker development environment, and offers amyraid of add-ons or allows you to create them.andM;#: 37190 S10/Consulting/Business Sb: #37057-Getting Started Fm: Sysop JohnMueller [DBA] 75300,576 To: MarkandM;I'm sure that you'll get a lot of good advice here on how to get yourbusiness started.andP;  There are quite a few people who know a lot about SQL onthe forum.andP;  Karen Watterson is one of the DBA staff members and SQL is herspecialty.andP;  As far as what to charge, it depends on you and your client.andO;Some consultants charge a straight fee for whatever they do.andP;  Some chargeaccording to what service they're asked to perform.andP;  You need to determine ifyou want to charge for travel time.andP;  If you sell off-the-shelf items as wellas custom software, you need to determine if you want to add a subcharge tothe products that you sell.andP;  A surcharge of 10 to 15 percent isn't all thatunusual.andP;  Adding a surcharge for travel time and/or off-the-shelf productswill allow you to reduce your hourly rate slightly and therefore look moreattractive than the competition.andP;  Unfortunately, some clients will feel thatyou're nickel and dimeing them to death with such a policy.andM;Remember to start slow and low.andP;  You won't build a client base immediately,and losing even one client at the beginning could be disasterous.andP;  In fact,it's better to charge the lowest rates possible when you first start out tohelp build that client base faster.andP;  It doesn't matter what you charge if youdon't have clients to bring in some money andless;gandgt;.andP;  Hope this helps.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
