The control and data acquisitioncircuitry of the facility is described and its performance is testedin an investigation of the effect of electrochemical polarization andhydrogen embrittlement on crack propagation in SP-33Sh steel exposedto a sodium chloride solution. The facility permits simultaneous measurementof the electrochemical parameters and the kinetics of corrosion crackpropagation.</TEXT></DOC>
