It was the second trial for Leland Beloff and aide Robert Rego, who conspired with reputed organized-crime boss Nicodemo &quot;Little Nicky&quot; Scarfo to extort $1 million from prominent developer Willard Rouse III, $50,000 from a second developer and a luxury apartment from a third in return for support on favorable legislation.    The verdict came the same day that Mr. Scarfo was charged in an unrelated case in the 1985 slaying of Frank &quot;Frankie Flowers&quot; D'Alfonso, a Philadelphia flower shop owner who, authorities said, was involved in heroin trafficking.    Mr. Beloff, 44 years old, and Mr. Rego, 42, were acquitted in their first trial of three minor charges, but the jury had deadlocked on the remainder. Mr. Beloff, who faces trial next month on voter fraud charges, lost in his May Democratic primary election bid to seek another term. During the trial, prosecutors contended Mr. Beloff and Mr. Rego hatched the extortion plot along with Mr. Scarfo, identified by federal authorities as boss of organized crime in Philadelphia and Atlantic City, N.J.    Mr. Scarfo was convicted in a trial in May on related extortion charges. </TEXT></DOC>
