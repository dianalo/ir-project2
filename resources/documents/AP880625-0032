The General Accounting Office report, presented Friday to theSenate Foreign Relations Committee, said exports to the UnitedStates had been cut by about $417 million and that the remainder ofthe reduction was in South Africa's exports of sanctioned goods to19 other countries.   ``Only in the agricultural products market was South Africa ableto offset losses from U.S. sanctions and to actually increase itstotal exports,'' said Allan I. Mendelowitz, an associate directorof the GAO's international division.   Mendelowitz said that since the enactment of the sanctions overPresident Reagan's veto in 1986, South Africa experienced sharplosses in exports of coal, iron and steel, uranium and textiles.   ``I think the bottom line, in shorthand, is that sanctions areworking in terms of economic impact,'' said Sen. Paul Simon,D-Ill., a member of the Senate panel. ``What we cannot know iswhether this will result in a policy change by South Africa.''   The testimony came as the committee concluded three days ofpublic hearings on legislation to tighten sanctions against SouthAfrica by requiring a near-total trade embargo and by requiring allU.S. companies to withdraw from the country.   Mendelowitz said that since 1984, 162 U.S. companies havewithdrawn from South Africa and that nine of the 150 companiesremaining have announced their intention to leave.   Opponents of the new sanctions have raised the possibility SouthAfrica might retaliate by cutting off exports to the United Statesof a list of strategic minerals of vital importance to U.S.industry.   Mendelowitz noted the U.S. Bureau of Mines recently reportedthere are sufficient alternative sources of supply for manganese,chromium, palladium, titanium and vanadium but not for platinum andrhodium.   The mines bureau also said that cobalt supplies would remainavailable from Zaire if new routes for shipping it were developedto bypass South African railways and ports.   Other witnesses representing U.S. companies remaining in SouthAfrica opposed the legislation, contending it would cost the jobsof thousands of black South Africans and shut down the programsthey have instituted changes   improve the lot of their black employees.</TEXT></DOC>
