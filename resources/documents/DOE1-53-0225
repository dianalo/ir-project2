The conclusionis that UBe/sub 13/ is a possible P-wave superconductor. Furthermore,we find the effect of f energy levels displacement relative to Fermienergy level and s-f hybridization increase due to applying pressureare of benefit to S-wave superconductors, but not of benefit to P-wavesuperconductors.</TEXT></DOC>
