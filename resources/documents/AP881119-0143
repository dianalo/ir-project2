One hundred sixty-seven people were arrested in Hartford, Conn.;about 125 in Buffalo, N.Y.; and 100 in Birmingham, Ala. On Friday,94 people were arrested in Birmingham, and 57 in Fremont, Calif.   Most of the demonstrators were supporters of Operation Rescue,which held protests in about two dozen cities on Oct. 30. Thosedemonstrations were linked to a continuing abortion protest inAtlanta that began when the Democratic National Convention was heldthere in July and has resulted in about 1,200 arrests.   About 250 demonstrators marched outside the HartfordGynecological Center clutching rosary beads, chanting prayers andcarrying signs proclaiming ``Abortion: Dial A for Murder'' and``Give The Unborn a Chance.''   ``We would love to be able say that no babies were killed at theHartford center today,'' said Anne L. Smith, of Chicopee, Mass., whowas handing out literature to patients entering the clinic.   ``I can't sit home and do my housework if people are beingkilled,'' said Smith, who displayed a plastic fetus she was carryingin her pocket.   Demonstrators also formed a human chain and sat down on thewalkway leading to the clinic, police said.   Several patients were escorted into the clinic by police. Atleast two patients, both teen-agers, entered the clinic through awindow at the back of building, police said.   A special court session was convened in Hartford to process theprotesters, who were charged with disorderly conduct, criminaltrespassing and interfering with a police officer, said HartfordState's Attorney John Bailey. Three were also charged withassaulting a police officer, he said.   During their detention, the demonstrators sang Christmas carols,religious hymns, and civil rights anthems such as ``We ShallOvercome'' and ``Keep Your Eyes On The Prize.'' But 57 people,apparently upset over the assault charges, refused to give theirnames and were sent to state prisons until they could appear Mondayin Hartford Superior Court, said Bailey.   The men were jailed in Hartford, while the women were bused tothe state's only women's prison, located 42 miles away in Niantic.Bailey said he did not know how many women were jailed.   Bailey said the city had not taken as many people in custody in asingle night since 1968, when black neighborhoods erupted inviolence after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.   In Buffalo, the protesters were charged with trespassing afterthey blocked entrances at the office of a gynecologist who performsabortions.   Four buses were used to remove them.   ``What it is doing is continuing to save babies from abortions,''said Joe Ciffa, spokesman for Project Rescue, which is affiliatedwith Operation Rescue. ``We are continuing to save lives.''   Police in Alabama had arrested more than 100 people by Saturdayafternoon who were participating in demonstrations at three women'sclinics.   Most of them were charged with misdemeanor offenses, includingtrespassing and harassment, said Maj. Frank Alexander.   On Friday, 94 people were arrested while blocking entrances inthe first day of protests at the Birmingham Women's Medical Clinic.   The California protesters targeted a Planned Parenthood officeFriday, police said.   Some of the protesters made police officers' jobs more difficultby smearing themselves with petroleum jelly, said police spokesmanDennis Satariano.</TEXT></DOC>
