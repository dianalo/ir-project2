Meister,president and chief executive officer.   Mr. Meister, in an interview, also said he expects thecompany to report its first profitable year in more thaneight years. Carrington has reported a profit through thefiscal 1991 nine months of $724,333, including tax benefitsof $235,800, and Mr. Meister said he expects that results forthe fourth quarter ending Nov. 30 will be comparable tothird-quarter net income of $403,309, or five cents a share,after a tax benefit of $132,000. For all of fiscal 1990,Carrington had a net loss of $6.1 million, or 98 cents ashare, on sales of $11.6 million.</LP><TEXT>   Sales for fiscal 1991 should be 36% to 38% higher thanlast year's and Mr. Meister said the company is &quot;endeavoringto maintain&quot; that growth rate.   For the foreseeable future, at least, acemannan won't becontributing much to those sales and profits. The U.S.Department of Agriculture approved marketing the drug only asan immune system stimulant to treat canine and felinefibrosarcoma, a rare animal cancer that currently isn'ttreatable. The Agriculture Department also is requiring thecompany to conduct further studies on the drug'seffectiveness before it gives its unconditional approval. Butbecause the disease is so rare, Carrington needs to testfewer animals than it would if it aimed the drug at morecommon cancers, Mr. Meister said.   Still, &quot;this approval gives Carrington's research atremendous credibility boost,&quot; Mr. Meister said.   Long a favorite of Wall Street short sellers, who trade inhopes that the stock price will fall, the company's stock hasclimbed and crashed in recent years as company officialstouted its drug as one that might help cure AIDS, cancer andother serious diseases. However, the company doesn't yet haveU.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for human tests ofthe drug, an extract of the aloe vera plant that also isknown by the trade name Carrisyn.</TEXT></DOC>
