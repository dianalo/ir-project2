<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-1314 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report presents a model of a detector for use in the superconductingsupercollider (SSC). By employing a combination of track-matching, calorimetric,longitudinal and transverse shower profile measurements, and transverseradiation detector information, the detector is capable of superior electronidentification. It has an excellent muon identification and measurementsystem, and it allows the use of an optimized calorimeter that is notcompromised by the requirements of a large magnetic field. The authorsconclude that a non-magnetic detector is a strong candidate for a 4piSSC detector for the study of high-mass phenomena. 23 refs., 14 figs.,3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
