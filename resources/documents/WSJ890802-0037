Among those agreeing to cooperate was a major target of the federal inquiry, veteran grain trader John N. Eggum, who agreed to plead guilty to felony charges, testify against other traders and give up trading forever, an industry official said. The deal was one of several cut in hopes of avoiding the harshest possible penalties, according to lawyers and industry officials.    The plea agreements should bolster the government's hand in the 2 1/2-year undercover investigation by turning some well-connected pit traders such as Mr. Eggum, 47 years old, into federal witnesses. Mr. Eggum, who sold his Chicago Board of Trade seat in January after receiving a late-night visit and subpoena from federal officials, was most recently a soybean futures trader.    Other plea agreements were reached in recent days with targeted traders at both the Board of Trade, where soybean and Treasury-bond futures trading is under investigation, and at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where yen, Swiss-franc and stock-index futures trading is being probed. Previously, only a handful of traders had been cooperating with prosecutors.    Separately, the Merc is bringing disciplinary charges against more traders than previously reported for suspect trades with FBI agents posing as traders. Those exchange cases are likely to anger U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas, who has warned the Merc that its internal investigation could hamper his own.    The Merc and Mr. Valukas have refused to comment on the issue.    The Board of Trade hasn't begun any disciplinary cases against its members based on trades with FBI agents, a spokesman said. &quot;We have been requested by the U.S. attorney not to,&quot; the spokesman said.    A news conference is scheduled this afternoon to announce indictments. Joining Mr. Valukas will be U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, Federal Bureau of Investigation director William Sessions and Wendy Gramm, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.    More plea agreements could be reached before indictments are announced. A person close to the inquiry said some defense lawyers were continuing to negotiate with assistant U.S. attorneys late yesterday.    Mr. Eggum declined to comment. His attorney, Miriam Miquelon, also refused to answer questions.    As part of his agreement, Mr. Eggum won't be charged with racketeering, potentially the most ruinous allegation because it can lead to large-scale asset seizures by the government, the industry official said. He is expected as of now to plead guilty to two counts of fraud, each of which could bring a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. A judge will decide the length of any jail term and the size of any fine.    Mr. Eggum also reached an administrative settlement with the CFTC that covers his lifetime trading ban, but doesn't involve a fine by the agency.    A longtime wheat-futures trader, Mr. Eggum moved during last year's drought-inspired soybean rally over to the &quot;bean pit,&quot; fellow traders say.    The exact trading abuses Mr. Eggum will plead guilty to weren't known yesterday. Earlier, people familiar with the federal investigation said he was suspected of participating in so-called bucketing -- trades made to illegally enrich those in the pit at the expense of unsuspecting outside investors.    Aside from Mr. Eggum, it was learned that yen trader Brian E. Sledz at the Merc agreed to plead guilty to two felony charges and to cooperate with the government's investigation. He also agreed to a separate administrative settlement with the CFTC that includes a three-year trading ban. Mr. Sledz's cooperation with prosecutors predates the most recent round of plea agreements.    Like Mr. Eggum, Mr. Sledz won't be named in a racketeering conspiracy as part of his plea agreement. Mr. Sledz is among the Merc traders facing exchange disciplinary charges for yen-pit trades with an undercover FBI agent.    Through his lawyer, Mr. Sledz declined to comment.    A lawyer said a soybean trader other than Mr. Eggum had entered into an agreement with terms similar to those accepted by Mr. Sledz.    The settlements and deals leading to them are in keeping with the carrot-and-stick approach the government has used all along. According to one defense attorney, who asked not to be named, an assistant U.S. attorney told him that cooperation could help a trader avoid a lifetime trading ban from the CFTC.    Dennis Klejna, the CFTC's enforcement director, late yesterday said the enforcement division &quot;would consider favorably&quot; cooperation with the U.S. attorney's office in making recommendations on commission sanctions against traders. &quot;We do think it's valuable for people to cooperate,&quot; he said, but adding, &quot;I don't want to suggest people are just going to walk away.&quot;    ---   Robert L.
