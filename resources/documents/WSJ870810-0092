Brazilian government sources said the new tensions stemmed from a request last week from commercial banks for an immediate goodwill payment of $400 million, representing about 25% of the overdue interest accumulated since Brazil declared a partial debt moratorium last February. This request, conveyed following a bankers' meeting in New York last Wednesday, was rejected by Finance Minister Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira.    The minister, the sources said, told bankers no such payment could be made until there are clear signs of progress in negotiations set to start next month, and until Brazil's reserves have been consolidated. Despite a fast-improving export performance -- preliminary figures show the country posted a record trade surplus last month of $1.42 billion -- reserves are still officially below $3.8 billion.    But U.S. bankers are concerned about an imminent deadline. On Aug. 20, six months will have elapsed since Brazil declared a moratorium on $67 billion of debt to foreign banks. If no payment is received by then, Brazil will have fulfilled an important condition for being classified as &quot;value impaired&quot; by U.S. monetary authorities at a meeting set for Oct. 20.    If the so-called Inter-Agency Country Exposure Review Committee -- made up of senior members of the Federal Reserve Board, office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. -- downgrades Brazil in this way, banks would be obliged to make loan-loss provisions equivalent to between 10% and 15% of their loans to Brazil. This would make any resumption of lending to Brazil extremely difficult, as well as making a marked dent in the big loan-loss reserves already established by U.S. banks in recent months. These reserves were not specifically linked to Brazil.    However, Mr. Bresser Pereira argues that the six-month deadline is irrelevant and that there will be ample time to make a payment before Oct. 20, providing negotiations are going well. He also insists that Brazil should pay no interest-rate spread above the banks' cost of funds and should reach an accord with commercial banks before any eventual agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Both these stances are viewed critically by banks.    In the face of these problems, the Brazilian sources said, a hard-line position is being prepared in the Finance Ministry and coordinated with Argentine authorities. This, however, would only be adopted if conventional negotiations with banks break down. Mr. Bresser Pereira continues to believe that these talks, in which Brazil is seeking $7.2 billion in new loans through the end of 1988, can be successful and an accord can be reached with the IMF.    The essence of the alternative tough stance -- outlined by Mr. Bresser Pereira at a meeting of economists last week in Sao Paulo -- is that banks should accept the secondary-market evaluation of their loans. Brazilian debt is currently trading at about 55% of its nominal value and Argentine debt at about 50%.    Therefore, Mr. Bresser Pereira argued, it should be possible to agree on substituting the debt with long-term bonds whose value would be marked down to take account of all or part of the lower secondary-market evaluation.    He suggested that banks could accept at least a 15% cut of this kind in the bonds' value, and the bonds could be guaranteed by the World Bank. The big loan-loss reserves recently set up by banks effectively demonstrated they were resigning themselves to this kind of arrangement, he argued. &quot;This would be a logical solution,&quot; he said, &quot;but logic often takes some time to be accepted.&quot;    Mr. Bresser Pereira met Roberto Frenkel, the top aide to Argentine Economics Minister Juan V. Sourrouille, at the meeting and sources said they agreed the secondary-market evaluation of debt should become an important platform in the countries' future debt talks.    Argentina is sympathetic to this view because it foresees severe balance-of-payments problems next year and feels that no further domestic sacrifices can be made to make payments on its $54 billion foreign debt.    This emerging joint Brazilian-Argentine posture is expected to be outlined at the IMF's annual meeting in Washington, beginning Sept. 24, the sources said. Before then, it should be clear whether the increasing difficulties in talks between Brazil and banks on an accord to end the debt moratorium can be overcome. </TEXT></DOC>
