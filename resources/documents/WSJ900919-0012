Terms weren't disclosed.   The move is part of MCI's continuing effort to boost itsinternational voice, data and video communications business.Since 1982, MCI has sought to expand its global reachprimarily through acquisitions.</LP><TEXT>   The long-distance telecommunications concern boughtWestern Union International Inc. in 1982; RCA GlobalCommunications Inc., a high-speed data and telex concern, in1987; and a 25% stake in Infonet Services Corp., aninternational dataswitching network and computing-servicesconcern, last January.   Privately held OTI, based in Alexandria, Va., providesdigital communications services and operates 24 earthstations world-wide, and thus will give MCI a larger presencein 27 countries. OTI specializes in small customer premisessatellite services between the U.S. and Latin America. Italso offers satellite earth-station project management,overseas private-line channels and international videoservices.   Annual revenue for OTI wasn't available.   Robert B. Morris III, a telecommunications analyst withGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co., said the acquisition is important toMCI because the company holds such a small share of theglobal marketplace and is &quot;virtually unknown&quot; outside theU.S. &quot;By purchasing other entities, MCI will raise its globalpresence and expand its market,&quot; he said.   MCI's current share of the international telephone marketranges between 12% and 13%, while American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. dominates with an estimated 80% to 85% share.   OTI will give MCI a stronger foothold in such markets asWest Germany, France, Spain, Singapore, Japan, Australia,Mexico, Argentina and Brazil.</TEXT></DOC>
