In this caseadsorption or absorption processes must be applied in order to meet thegas specifications. During trials performed in one of BEB's North Germangas fields, a selected adsorption process was tested in a pilot plantin cooperation between BEB and Lurgi. In particular, regeneration withheated raw gas at adsorption pressure was investigated. The suitabilityof the process was confirmed using activated carbon as an adsorbent.Based -1- on the data obtained from the test, the operating plant couldbe optimally designed. The latest environmental legislation was takeninto account as regards both the disposal of used activated carbon andthe avoidance of environmental pollution.</TEXT></DOC>
