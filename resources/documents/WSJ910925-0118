And I didn't want thatin writing.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr.Allen defended the performance of Robert Gates, then CIAdeputy director. But his explicit concern about White Houseinvolvement in the diversion contradicts the account given byhis former boss, who has been nominated by President Bush tohead the agency.   Richard Kerr, the CIA's acting director, testified thathe, too, had been warned by Mr. Allen that the NationalSecurity Council staff was tied to the potential diversion,and Mr. Kerr recounted discussing this point with Mr. Gatesmonths before the scandal became public.   Mr. Gates has insisted that he wasn't aware of anyevidence of the NSC or other government officials being partyto the diversion. But in days of hearings, the picture beingdrawn in the committee record is of a CIA that grewincreasingly anxious during 1986 over its supportive role toaides in the Reagan White House. The late Director WilliamCasey was seen as a bridge directly to Mr. Reagan, and thisoff-the-record partnership was reflected most vividly intestimony last week by the CIA's former Central America taskforce chief, Alan Fiers.   &quot;Sometime in the dark of the night, Bill Casey has said,`I'll take Central America, just leave it to me,'&quot; Mr. Fiershas recounted being told by Clair George, then head of CIAoperations. And in an addendum to the record submittedyesterday, Mr. Fiers clarified that Mr. George wasspeculating about a conversation between Mr. Casey and Mr.Reagan.   Mr. Allen's background in analysis and counterterrorismmade him an early player in White House efforts to free U.S.hostages by selling arms to Tehran. Beginning in 1985, theseinitiatives first relied on shipments through Israel. But inearly 1986, the NSC took charge more directly through its ownmiddlemen and an Iranian channel under arms dealer ManucherGhorbanifar.   Initially in 1985, Mr. Allen was told by Mr. Casey and theNSC to bypass the CIA's intelligence divisions-headed then byMr. Gates. But in the following year, the analyst would goback to his old bosses to raise concerns about the securityof the operation and evidence that huge profits were beingmade on the arms sales.   Through the spring and summer of 1986, Iranian procurementofficials and Mr. Ghorbanifar were increasingly bitter aboutthe prices being charged. And Mr. Allen said his concernsabout a potential diversion fell into place when the NSC setup a second channel to Iran to be controlled by the samemiddlemen who were assisting the White House in runningsupplies to anti-Sandinista insurgents in Nicaragua.   Mr. Allen testified he raised his first warnings to Mr.Kerr in late August 1986, though separate informationsuggests the two men could have discussed the issue as earlyas May that year. Mr. Kerr recalls raising the matter, inturn, with Mr. Gates in August. But it wasn't until Octoberthat the nominee recalls being confronted with thecontroversy, when Mr. Allen spoke directly to him and laterMr. Casey.   Even then, Mr. Gates has characterized the evidence as&quot;worrisome but extraordinarily flimsy.&quot; Though he saw thatthe matter was taken to Mr. Casey and the White House, he hassaid he was slow to realize that the NSC was directlyinvolved. By contrast, the intelligence cited by Mr. Allenshowed a huge discrepancy in the pricing on the weapons. Andthe analyst said his decision to go to Mr. Gates on Oct. 1came after a September meeting in which an NSC aide discussedtapping millions of dollars held in &quot;reserve&quot; to placate Mr.Ghorbanifar.   As late as Nov. 21, 1986, when Mr. Casey went beforeCongress to explain the Iran initiative, his testimony madeno mention of the alleged diversion. A half-dozen senior CIAofficers were then aware of Mr. Allen's warnings, but Mr.Allen said he chose not to press the issue further in thedrafting sessions he attended.</TEXT></DOC>
