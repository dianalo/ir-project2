Alliance-Industrial said that 21,189,852 General Trustco shares were tendered yesterday through the Montreal Exchange under Alliance-Industrial's previously announced 12-dollar-a-share offer for 10.5 million General Trustco shares.    Alliance-Industrial said it purchased 10,594,925 of the shares tendered on a pro-rata basis of 50%. Alliance-Industrial purchased more shares than originally intended to avoid leaving General Trustco holders with odd lots, an Alliance-Industrial official said.    Alliance-Industrial is a financial services holding company unit of Industrial-Alliance Life Insurance Co., a Quebec City-based mutual life insurance concern. General Trustco is a Montreal-based trust concern with assets of 3.9 billion dollars. A trust company is similar to a U.S. savings and loan.    General Trustco closed yesterday in Montreal Exchange trading at 10 dollars ($7.60), down 50 cents.    The additional shares give Alliance-Industrial a total 21.9 million out of 34.9 million General Trustco shares outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
