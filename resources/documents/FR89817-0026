Introduction </ITAG>EPA is amending the FIFRA GLP standards (40 CFR Part 160) to incorporatemany of the changes made by the Food and Drug Administration to its GLPregulations. A. Legal Authority These standards are promulgated under the authority of sections 3, 4, 5,6, 8, 18, 24(c), and 25(a) of FIFRA, 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq., as amended,sections 408, 409, and 701 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA),21 U.S.C. 301 et seq., and the Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970. B. Background EPA originally published FIFRA GLP standards in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 29, 1983 (48 FR 53946), which werecodified as 40 CFR part 160. At the same time, EPA published GLP standardsapplicable to testing required under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA,48 FR 53922, 40 CFR part 792). These regulations were promulgated in responseto investigations by EPA and FDA during the mid-1970s which revealed thatsome studies submitted to the Agencies had not been conducted in accordancewith acceptable laboratory practices. Some studies had been conducted sopoorly that the resulting data could not be relied upon in EPA's regulatorydecision-making process. For instance, some studies had been submittedwhich did not adhere to specified protocols, were conducted by underqualifiedpersonnel and supervisors, or were not adequately monitored by study sponsors.In some cases results were selectively reported, underreported, or fraudulentlyreported. In addition, it was discovered that some testing facilities displayedpoor animal care procedures and inadequate record-keeping techniques. TheFIFRA GLP standards specify minimum practices and procedures which mustbe followed in order to ensure the quality and integrity of data submittedto EPA in support of a research or marketing permit for a pesticide product.When EPA published its final FIFRA and TSCA GLP standards in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 29, 1983, EPA sought to harmonizethe requirements and language with those regulations promulgated by theFDA in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of December 22, 1978 (43 FR 60013), and codifiedas 21 CFR part 58. Differences between the two Agencies' current GLP regulationsexist only to the extent necessary to reflect the Agencies' different statutoryresponsibilities under TSCA, FIFRA, and the Federal Food, Drug and CosmeticAct (FFDCA). Similar to the FDA GLP regulations, the FIFRA and TSCA GLPstandards delineate standards for studies designed to determine the healtheffects of a test substance; however, the TSCA GLP standards also containprovisions related to environmental testing (i.e., ecological effects andchemical fate). Compliance with EPA's FIFRA and TSCA GLP standards has been monitored througha program of laboratory inspections and study audits coordinated betweenEPA and FDA. Under an Interagency Agreement originated in 1978, FDA carriesout GLP inspections at laboratories which conduct health effects testing.EPA primarily performs GLP inspections for environmental laboratories andconducts data audits for health effects and environmental studies. After a thorough review of its GLP regulations and compliance program,FDA concluded that some of the provisions of the GLP regulations neededto be clarified, amended, or deleted to reduce the regulatory burden ontesting facilities. Accordingly, FDA revised its GLP regulations in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 4, 1987 (52 FR 33768). These GLPrevisions are intended to simplify the regulations without compromisingstudy integrity. EPA agrees with FDA that many provisions of the GLP regulations can bestreamlined without compromising the goals of the GLP standards. Therefore,EPA is amending the FIFRA GLP standards to incorporate many of the changesmade by FDA to its revised GLP regulations. In addition, EPA is expandingthe scope of the FIFRA GLP standards to include the environmental testingprovisions currently found in the TSCA GLP standards. EPA's revision tothe FIFRA GLP standards also extends their scope to include product performancedata (efficacy testing) as currently required to be submitted by 40 CFR158.640. In summary, the FIFRA GLP standards will allow EPA to ensure thequality and integrity of all data submitted in support of pesticide productresearch or marketing permits. Elsewhere in this <T4>Federal Register</T4>, EPA is making similar changes to the TSCA GLPstandards. C. Consistency With FDA GLP Regulations It is EPA's policy to minimize the regulatory burden on the public whichmight arise from conflicting requirements promulgated under different regulatoryauthorities. In keeping with this policy, the final FIFRA 1983 GLP standards,40 CFR part 160, followed the format and, with few exceptions, the wordingof FDA's final GLP regulations, 21 CFR part 58. Differences between theEPA and FDA GLP regulations were based upon varying needs and responsibilitiesunder each Agency's regulatory statutes. This revision to the FIFRA GLPstandards follows this same policy by conforming to many of the changesFDA made to its GLP regulations, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 4, 1987 (52 FR 33768). EPA has variedfrom FDA's revised GLP regulations only when necessary due to EPA's statutoryresponsibilities. The most significant differences between the EPA andthe FDA revised GLP regulations are the scope of the testing and test systemsaffected. More specifically, EPA is requiring compliance with the FIFRA GLP standardsfor all studies submitted to EPA which are intended to support pesticideproduct research or marketing permits. Under the 1983 FIFRA GLP regulationsEPA only required GLP compliance under FIFRA for health effects testing.However, unlike FDA, testing required by EPA in support of research ormarketing permits may include ecological effects, environmental and chemicalfate, and efficacy (as stipulated by 40 CFR 158.640 Product performancedata requirements), as well as health effects testing. Therefore, in aneffort to attain consistency in the quality and the integrity of all datasubmitted to the Agency, EPA has determined that it is necessary to expandthe scope of the FIFRA GLP standards to require that all types of testingwhich are used to obtain data in support of research or marketing permitsbe conducted in accordance with the amended GLP standards that are requiredto be submitted under 40 CFR 158.640. EPA's amended FIFRA GLP standards also vary from FDA's in their coverageof testing conducted in the field. To ensure the quality and integrityof all data submitted in support of research or marketing permits, EPAbelieves that GLP standards must apply whenever data collection occurs.Because many of the test data required by EPA under FIFRA are developedin the field, or more accurately in outdoor laboratories (i.e., groundwater studies, air monitoring studies, degradation in soil, etc.), EPAis including field testing within the scope of the standards. EPA's FIFRA GLP standards also differ from FDA's in the scope of the requirementsprovided for test system care facilities, test system supply facilities,and test system care. Because testing required by FDA is focused on healthtesting, in which animals are the central test system, it is appropriatefor FDA's GLP regulations to focus on requirements for appropriate animalcare facilities (21 CFR 58.43), adequate animal supply facilities (21 CFR58.45), and proper animal care (21 CFR 58.90). However, the broad rangeof testing required by EPA may involve plants, soils, and microorganisms,as well as animals, for the primary test systems. To ensure the qualityand integrity of all data submitted to EPA, andSection; 160.43 Animal carefacilities, andSection; 160.45 Animal supply facilities, and andSection; 160.90Animal care are being expanded to cover facilities, handling, and careof all test systems. Accordingly, EPA is retitling these sections as follows:andSection; 160.43 Test system care facilities, andSection; 160.45 Test systemsupply facilities, and andSection; 160.90 Animal and other test system care.Further, in most instances, EPA is replacing the term ``animal,'' whichis currently used in the FIFRA GLP standards, with the broader term ``testsystem.'' Specifically, this change occurs in andSection;andSection; 160.43,160.45, 160.81, 160.90 and 160.120. These changes are further discussedin Unit II. of this preamble. The remaining differences between the EPA and FDA GLP regulations are describedin the preamble to this final rule and the preamble to the FIFRA GLP standards,published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 29, 1983 (48 FR 53946). EPA has coordinatedthis final rule with FDA and has considered public comments on the December28, 1987 EPA proposal (52 FR 48920). D. Publication of the Complete Rule The entire FIFRA GLP rule (40 CFR part 160) is published in this noticeto simplify interpretation and facilitate the use of this notice by theregulated community.

Summary of Comments and Responses </ITAG>EPA received 43 comment letters: 24 from manufacturers of pesticide productsregulated by EPA, 8 from associations, 10 from testing or consulting laboratories,and l from another government agency. The majority of the comments supportedthe proposed changes, although numerous suggestions were made for additionalrevisions to parts of the 1983 FIFRA GLP regulations not subject to thisrulemaking or modifications to the proposed changes. Comments that raisedimportant policy questions, suggested modification to the essence of theproposed regulation, or required an individual response, are discussedbelow. Comments addressing changes to the GLP standards that were not proposedare not the subject of this rulemaking. However, all comments made havebeen placed in the public record. A. General Provisions 1. <T3>Scope_Comment: </T3>EPA should specify exactly what categories of studies(especially efficacy) are covered under the revised GLP regulations sincethey are discussed in the preamble and will not appear at 40 CFR part 160when the final rule is published. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA intends GLP standards to cover all types of studiesrequired to be submitted and does not feel it necessary to list each type.Please note that EPA is developing additional product performance regulations.EPA plans to consider the impact that GLP standards will have on thesenew product performance requirements to determine if the fuIl scope ofthe GLP standards should apply to studies performed to fulfill these requirements.Unless the GLP rule is modified to specifically exclude certain parts ofproduct performance regulations, the full GLP rule will apply to all existingand prospective product performance studies required under 40 CFR 158.640.2. <T3>Definitions</T3>_a. <T3>Batch. </T3>The definition of ``batch'' is expanded to include referencesubstances. This was an omission in the proposed rule that is correctedin the final rule to maintain consistency with the use of the term in andSection;160.105(a). b. <T3>Carrier</T3>_i. <T3>Comment: </T3>The word ``systems'' should replace the word ``organisms''in the definition of ``carrier,'' to be consistent with the term ``testsystem.'' <T3>Response: </T3>EPA concurs with the suggestion. To be consistent withthe definition of ``test systems,'' the word is changed accordingly. ii. <T3>Comment: </T3>EPA should revise the list in parentheses that followsthe word ``material'' in the definition of ``carrier'' to make it all inclusive.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA has decided to add the phrase ``including but notlimited to  * * *'', to indicate that the list provides examples and isnot meant to be all inclusive. c. <T3>Control substance</T3>_i. <T3>Comment: </T3>Since ``material'' conveys a broader description than``substance'' and is already used in definitions for ``carrier,'' ``controlsubstance,'' and ``reference substance,'' ``chemical substance'' shouldbe changed to ``chemical material'' in the definition of ``control substance.''<T3>Response: </T3>EPA does not believe that a change in terminology isneeded to broaden the definition since the term ``material'' is alreadyincluded in the present definition. The term ``substance'' must also beretained to maintain consistency with TSCA and the TSCA GLP standards.ii. <T3>Comment: </T3>EPA should delete the phrase ``for no-effect levels''in the definition of control substance. The definition as written is toonarrow and excludes analytical chemistry (e.g., chemical fate, residuechemistry) operations where the term ``control'' has a meaning distinctlydifferent from biological effects. <T3>Response: </T3>Since the purpose of the analytical control is to establisheventually that none of the materials administered to the test system interferewith identification of the test substance and its degradate(s) and metabolite(s),EPA agrees that the terminology is too limiting and is replacing the phrase``for no-effect levels'' with the phrase ``for known chemical or biologicalmeasurements.'' The definition now reads: ``Control substance means anychemical substance or mixture, or any other material other than a testsubstance, feed, or water, that is administered to the test system in thecourse of a study for the purpose of establishing a basis for comparisonwith the test substance for known chemical or biological measurements.'' d.<T3> Experimental start and termination dates_Comment:</T3> These dateswould be difficult to predict, especially for field studies, because theywould be subject to natural or man-made conditions that cannot be controlledor anticipated. Since the dates would be subject to change, many protocolamendments would be required, thereby creating an undue administrativeburden. <T3>Response:</T3> The experimental start and termination dates specifiedin the protocol are merely proposed dates. Therefore if the actual experimentalstart or termination date is different from the proposed dates no protocolamendment shall be required. e. <T3>Reference substance_Comment:</T3> If EPA intended the term ``referencesubstance'' to include analytical and calibration standards, then severalother sections of the proposed rule which mention ``reference substance,''would also require the same types of records to be kept for analyticalstandards. This would constitute an excessive burden on management whichwould require maintaining various records that do not add any value tothe study. <T3>Response:</T3> The definition of reference substance is intended toinclude analytical reference standards. Therefore, EPA has modified thedefinition of ``reference substance,'' as follows: ``Reference substancemeans any chemical substance or mixture, analytical reference standard,or material, other than a test substance, feed, or water, that is administeredto, or used, in analyzing the test system in the course of a study forpurposes of establishing a basis for comparison with the test substancefor known chemical or biological measurements.'' EPA believes this changeeliminates any ambiguity in the definition. EPA disagrees that inclusion of analytical reference standards in thispart constitutes an excessive documentation burden or adds no value tothe study. Documentation which supports defining analytical reference standardsshould not require excess paperwork since common laboratory practices alreadyrequire assurance of the validity of standards in order to make certainthat the measurements are accurate. f. <T3>Study_</T3>i.<T3> Comment:</T3> ``Basic exploratory studies'' are excluded from GLPstandards, but the results of such studies may be required to meet GLPstandards, if included in support of research or marketing permits. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA does not wish to discourage basic exploratory testingand does not explicitly require GLP standards for such tests even if thedata are later submitted to EPA. However, if the data are to be used insole support of a marketing permit such non-GLP studies may not be accepted.GLP standards are required when data is developed in the context of a studythat is required to be submitted to EPA in support of a research or marketingpermit. Where GLP standards were not followed in the case of a study performedwith the original intent of exploratory testing, a GLP compliance statementshould be included in the study report to indicate this. ii.<T3> Comment:</T3> It is not clear what constitutes separate studies andwhat studies could be included under a single protocol. Specifically, isa test system located in several different geographical locations a singlestudy or would each location by means of its particular requirements needto be a separate study? <T3>Response:</T3> The protocol defines what the study entails. Therefore,if the test system for a specific study is located in different geographicallocations, the protocol will describe the study as being located at thedifferent sites. EPA is adding the phrase ``at one or more test sites''to the definition of ``study'' to clarify the intent that more than onefield site may be included in one study. iii.<T3> Comment:</T3> The proposed definition of study would imply that eachdetermination such as stability, solubility, octanol water partition coefficient,volatility, persistence, and other data point determinations would be separatestudies with concomitant requirements such as protocols and quality assuranceunit (QAU) inspections. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA intends that QAU inspections as listed in andSection;160.35 be conducted at intervals adequate to ensure the integrity of thestudy for each determination such as stability, solubility, octanol waterpartition coefficient, volatility, persistence, and other data point determinations.However, if done as part of a larger study, then these determinations arecovered under the larger study's protocol or standard operating procedure(SOP). If they are submitted to EPA as studies unto themselves, then theydo require their own protocols. iv.<T3> Comment:</T3> An experiment such as product chemistry which does notinvolve a test system cannot be considered a ``study'' and therefore wouldnot be covered by GLP standards.<T3> Response:</T3> Studies designed to determine the physical or chemicalcharacteristics of a test substance are included within the scope of theseregulations. Therefore, EPA intends to include product chemistry experimentsin the definition of ``study.'' This change is consistent with the definitionof the term ``study'' as it now appears, and as it appears in the TSCAGLP standards at 40 CFR Part 792. In the case of product chemistry experiments,the test substance itself may be the test system. v.<T3> Comment:</T3> The addition of the term ``or in the environment'' tothe definition of ``study'' indicates that the change extends the proposedregulations to field studies. While it is necessary to ensure the validityof all data collected, the variety and special requirements of field researchhave not been addressed in the new rules.<T3> Response:</T3> These regulations are intended to apply to all studiesrequired to be submitted under FIFRA, including those conducted in thefield. EPA recognizes that field studies vary and have special requirements,but believes that the development of protocols and SOPs by the testingfacility provides adequate flexibility in this respect. vi.<T3> Comment:</T3> Why are metabolism, product performance, environmentaland chemical fate, persistence and residue listed in the definition of``study'', but not toxicology data or data to assess hazards and productchemistry.= <T3>Response:</T3> The list is not meant to be limiting in any way. Datato assess toxicology, hazards and product chemistry are included under``effects'' and ``other characteristics'' under the new definition of ``study''.vii.<T3> Comment:</T3> ``Prospectively'' should not be deleted from the definitionof study. If the essence of GLPs requires a carefully planned study andthe proposed rule is very strict about documentation that must be completedprior to the experimental start date, how can the GLP standards also applyto studies that were generated without a protocol or advance planning,such as epidemiology. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA disagrees with the comment. The term prospectivelyis deleted because EPA wishes all studies, including epidemiological studieswhere past exposure to a study population is determined or estimated retrospectively,to be performed under GLP standards. EPA recognizes that in such studiesdata used may not have been generated in conformance with FIFRA GLP standards.However, it is EPA's position that the epidemiological study itself canbe conducted and submitted to EPA in accordance with the GLP standards.Retrospective aspects of such studies that are not performed accordingto GLP standards, for example, test system treatment, should be identifiedin the compliance statement submitted with the study report. In addition, the types of studies potentially not covered by these regulationswere expanded in the definition of ``study'' to include experiments involvingtest methods.g. <T3>Study initiation and completion date_Comment: </T3>EPA should deletethe definition of ``study initiation date'' and ``study completion date,''since these terms were not defined in the 1983 GLP standards. The dateswill be included in the protocol and final report and do not need furtheremphasis. Response: EPA believes that it is necessary to define the terms to differentiatethem from ``experimental start and termination'' dates. These terms indicatethe dates on which specific milestones occur during a study. The definitionis necessary to clarify EPA's requirements, and to ensure consistency withFDA's GLP regulations (52 FR 33780). The phrase ``close of the study'' as used in andSection; 160.33(f), and thephrase ``study is completed'' as used in andSection; 160.195(b)(3) both referto the ``study completion date.'' Therefore, as of the study completiondate: (1) Under andSection; 160.33(f), the study director must ensure thatall raw data, documentation, protocols, specimens, and final reports aretransferred to the archives; (2) after this date under andSection; 160.185(c),corrections or additions to the final report must be in the form of anamendment by the study director under the procedures specified in thatsection; and (3) in the applicable situations described in andSection; 160.195(b)(3),records must be maintained for a period of at least 2 years following thestudy completion date. Furthermore, the phrase ``study is initiated'' as used in andSection; 160.31(a),and the phrase ``study was initiated'' as used in andSection; 160.35(b)(1)would refer to the ``study initiation date.'' Therefore, as of the studyinitiation date: (1) Under andSection; 160.31(a), the testing facility managementwould designate a study director; (2) under andSection; 160.35(b)(1), thestudy would be entered on the master schedule sheet by the QAU; and (3)under andSection; 160.120(b), after this date all changes or revisions inthe protocol would be documented, signed by the study director, and dated.EPA also expects that as of the study initiation date, under andSection;160.31(e), the testing facility management would have ensured that personnel,resources, facilities, equipment, material, and methodologies are availableas scheduled. h. <T3>Test system_Comment: </T3>What constitutes the ``test system'' in testsof pre-emergent herbicides, soil pesticides, and product chemistry studies?Response: The definition of ``test system'' includes the statement thatit is ``* * * any * * * chemical or physical matrix * * *'', includingsubparts thereof that are treated with the test, control, or referencesubstance and also appropriate components of the system that are not treated.Therefore, test systems may include the soils that pesticides are appliedto, and in the case of product chemistry, the test system may be the testsubstance itself. EPA is including the term ``reference,'' which was inadvertently omittedfrom the definition as it appeared in the proposed rule. In addition, EPAis replacing ``e.g.'' in the parenthetical with ``including but not limitedto'' in order to clarify that it is not our intent for the list to be allencompassing. i. <T3>Vehicle_Comment: </T3>The definition of ``vehicle'' serves to clarifythe GLP standards, but there has been no confusion based on the currentstandards and this change is contrary to EPA's stated objective of beingconsistent with FDA's GLP regulations. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA believes that clarification is needed. The EPA GLPstandards cover a larger number of types of studies and the need for clarificationof the meaning of potentially ambiguous terms is greater. B. Organization and Personnel 1. <T3>Testing Facility Management_Comment: </T3>The specific requirementto document the replacement of the study director as raw data should beretained. The ``master schedule'' should not be considered ``raw data''as was indicated in the preamble (52 FR 48923) to the proposed rule. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA deleted the requirement that the replacement ofa study director must be documented as ``raw data'' to conform to the revisedFDA GLP regulations. This is because replacement of the study directormust be reflected on the master schedule sheet, which is a study recordthat must be retained. In addition, the term ``reference,'' which was inadvertently omitted inthe proposed rule, has been added to andSection; 160.31(d). 2. <T3>Study Director_Comment: </T3>Archiving the study records within a ``reasonableperiod'' after the study completion date, instead of at the close of thestudy as required by andSection; 160.33(f), would not impact on the integrityof the records. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA believes that the requirement that all raw data,documentation, protocols, specimens, and final reports be transferred tothe archives at a definitive time, i.e. the study completion date, is necessary.This assures an intact audit trail for the study. 3. <T3>Quality assurance unit_</T3>i. <T3>Comment: </T3>A QAU that is entirely separate from and independentof the personnel engaged in the conduct of the study creates an unjustifiedfinancial burden on some facilities. In some cases it would be impossibleto establish a completely independent QAU with qualified personnel. <T3>Response: </T3>As stated in the proposed rule (52 FR 48920), EPA doesnot require the QAU to be a fixed, permanently staffed unit whose onlyfunctions are to monitor the quality of a study. EPA is only concernedthat there be a distinct separation of duties between those personnel involvedwith the conduct or direction of a study and those personnel performingquality assurance on the same study. Therefore, andSection; 160.35(a) prohibitspersonnel from performing quality assurance activities on their own study.The regulations allow a study director for a particular study to serveas a part of the QAU or as the QAU for a different study. FDA noted (52FR 33771) that it was aware that many small laboratories could not affordthe operation of a permanently staffed QAU. EPA would like to point outthat in those situations where there are different individuals performingthe quality assurance functions for different studies, each individualis required to maintain that portion of the master schedule sheet whichrelates to the study being monitored. For this reason, EPA agrees withFDA's conclusion that the separation of functions on a study-by-study basis,as permitted in the existing and revised regulations, would provide effectivequality assurance. In view of the potential gain to management, to sponsors,and to EPA, through the added assurance of well-conducted studies, theincreased costs are thereby justified. EPA believes that its intent ismore clearly indicated by the changes now being made. ii. <T3>Comment: </T3>EPA should delete the requirement to index the masterschedule by test substance, and the QAU should only be required to indexthe master schedule to facilitate retrieval of the information monitored.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA acknowledges that a test facility may have severalstudies in progress on each test substance that is listed on the masterschedule sheet. However, EPA concludes that deleting the requirement toindex by test substance would be inappropriate, since the master schedulesheet is the mechanism through which the QAU can assure management thatthe facilities are satisfactory and there are adequate numbers of competentpersonnel available to perform the scheduled tasks. Furthermore, andSection;160.31(e) requires that management assure that study materials (e.g., testsubstances) are available as planned. Therefore, elimination of this requirementwould hinder a major function of the master schedule sheet and hamper theconduct of a critical management role. iii. <T3>Comment: </T3>Laboratory management should have the discretion to determinewho enters the data into the master schedule, as long as the required informationis listed. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA believes that management retains such discretionsince it is involved in determining the composition of the QAU and it providesan adequate number of such personnel (andSection;andSection; 160.31(c) and(e)). The QAU is distinguished by training that ensures that QAU functionsare properly conducted. As stated above, study personnel may belong tothe QAU as long as they are not performing the QAU functions associatedwith studies they are involved in.  iv. <T3>Comment:</T3> Do all studies conducted by an analytical laboratoryhave to be listed on a master schedule, or just those studies that willbe, or likely be, submitted to EPA? <T3>Response:</T3> The GLP standards specifically exempt many product chemistrystudies as described in andSection; 160.135. The master schedule need onlylist those analytical chemistry studies that will be or will likely besubmitted to EPA. v. <T3>Comment:</T3> The requirement for inspection of each study under andSection;160.35(b)(3) regardless of duration is excessive for the quality assuranceneeded to address study integrity, especially where studies are performedby highly standardized procedures. The repetitive inspection of these typesof studies would consume large amounts of time for both the study personneland QAU staff. Auditing each study is not necessary to ensure the workis conducted in compliance with the regulations. Random sampling proceduresshould be allowed in selecting studies and phases of studies to inspectto decrease the work load and resource requirements of the QAU. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA does not believe that a random inspection programwould be an appropriate method of evaluating a study. Generally, randomsampling provides an adequate means of quality control where analysis involvesrepetition or identical procedures. However, any assumption that the conductof one phase of one study would be representative of another would be invalidatedby the differences among study personnel and the operations they conduct.Furthermore, this requirement is not intended for all routine studies.Section 160.35(b) is among the exclusions for chemical and physical characterizationstudies as listed in andSection; 160.135(b). In conformance with the revised FDA GLP regulations (52 FR 33780), EPAmodified the requirements of andSection; 160.35(b)(3) to provide for inspectionsof a study on a schedule adequate to ensure the integrity of the study.The changes to this section will allow the QAU the necessary latitude toadjust its monitoring activities to meet the individual needs of each study.However, each study, no matter how short, must be inspected at least oncewhile in progress. EPA expects that by allowing the QAU flexibility indesigning a reasonable inspection schedule, the goal of ensuring the qualityof the study can be best achieved. vi. <T3>Comment:</T3> EPA indicates in the preamble to the proposed rule (andSection;160.35(e), (52 FR 48923)) that all QAU records will now be routinely availableto inspectors. Existing GLP standards treat certain QAU records as confidential,and explicitly state that the only QAU records to be reviewed by EPA auditorswould be the master schedule (e.g., the inspection dates, study inspected,the phase or segment of the study inspected and the name of the individualperforming the inspection). If QAU records for findings and correctiveaction are available on an auditor's request, QAUs would lose their effectiveness.<T3>Response:</T3> EPA shares the concerns of the commenters that accessto all parts of a QAU inspection would weaken the inspection system, andrecognizes the need to maintain a degree of confidentiality. Therefore,records of findings and problems, as well as records of corrective actionrecommended and taken, are exempt from routine EPA inspections, exceptunder special circumstances as indicated in andSection; 160.15. However,EPA maintains that all other reports and records must be easily accessibleand made available to EPA and FDA inspectors when requested as indicatedin andSection; 160.35(c). C. Facilities 1. <T3>General_</T3>i. <T3>Comment:</T3> Outdoor testing facilities should not be under GLP standardssince: (a) Outdoor test facilities will be conducting studies accordingto approved protocols; (b) ensuring suitability is highly subjective basedon the diverse number of possible locations; (c) there is a concomitantlack of clear standards for determining suitability of locations. Proceduresmust be specified by EPA regarding the determination of suitability forlocations, testing facilities, etc. Despite best efforts, the choice could always be subject to criticism andeven criminal liability based on a good faith Compliance Statement indicatingGLP standards had been followed. Most outdoor testing is done to mimicnormal agricultural conditions which are specific for the test substanceand use being proposed. Therefore, the determination of whether the size,construction or location of a facility is suitable for a study is a technicalissue, and is not within the scope of the GLP regulation and would be consideredin the experimental design of the protocol. <T3>Response:</T3> In cases where an EPA-approved protocol establishestest locations, that protocol would satisfy GLP requirements. EPA considersany site to be the testing facility wherever testing is undertaken to generatedata required to be submitted to EPA. The conditions required by the protocolare not necessarily conducive to artificial manipulation in the field,or to other outdoor testing facilities. Therefore, ensuring the suitabilityof the location of these types of testing facilities is both a valid andnecessary part of protocols approved by EPA. ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> The design of the individual scientist could be dictatedby andSection; 160.41 since a ``testing facility'' (definition from andSection;160.3) means ``a person who actually conducts a study * * *'' The term``test site'' should be defined to refer to the actual location of a given``study system.'' ``Testing facility'' could then be used as currentlydefined and refer to an individual (mobile development scientist or scientistworking from a testing farm facility). <T3>Response:</T3> The definition of ``person'' in this Part refers tothe legal entity responsible for testing, including organizational units.Consequently, it does not specifically indicate an individual scientist.2. <T3>Test system care facilities_</T3>i. <T3>Comment:</T3> Instead of expanding the original document to fit alltest systems, the old rules should be left as is, and a statement addedto cover non-animal test systems. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA disagrees with the comment and believes that specificchanges of the old rule are necessary to avoid ambiguity concerning themeaning of non-animal test systems. ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 160.43(a)(2) and (b), (e), (f), (g), and (h)should be deleted because EPA has already stated that these GLP requirementswill be applicable to all types of testing. It is not necessary to addthe four new paragraphs detailing specific requirements of environmentalconditions for aquatic organisms and plants. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA believes that some test systems, e.g. aquatic, areunique, and for the sake of clarity, they require special treatment inthe regulations. iii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Field studies should be exempted because isolation isnot possible in these types of studies. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA disagrees and believes that inclusion of field studiesposes no unusual burden, since the separation is only required to be ``asneeded'' to ensure ``proper separation.'' If the procedures used are justifiablebased on experimental design and documented, then this requirement is met.``Proper separation'' in a field study may mean simply that only one cropis planted in the same subplot.iv. <T3>Comment:</T3> The change in andSection; 160.43(c) is appropriate butthe current wording does not require separate disease handling facilitiesin every case. The proposed change has merit in clarifying the optionsavailable to laboratories and the change promotes harmony between EPA andFDA GLP regulations. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA agrees with the comment. In andSection; 160.43(c),EPA is deleting the requirement that separate areas be provided in allcases for the diagnosis, treatment, and control of test system diseases.Instead, a change is made so that separate areas are provided ``as appropriate.''This change is consistent with the September 4, 1987, revised FDA GLP regulationsand the revised TSCA GLP regulations. EPA has made this change to allow laboratories the option of disposingof diseased test systems without also bearing the expense of maintainingseparate areas in testing facilities for diagnosis, treatment, and controlof disease. Additionally, EPA recognizes that the diagnosis and treatmentrequirements of andSection; 160.43(c) may not be appropriate when dealingwith such test systems as soil, plants, or microorganisms. However, ifthe decision is made not to dispose of the test system, test system carefacilities, as specified in andSection; 160.43(c), must be provided. 3. <T3>Test system supply facilities_</T3>i. <T3>Comment:</T3> The first sentence in andSection; 160.45(a) should be changedso that plants and plant materials are covered in this section. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA believes that since plants and plant materials arecovered in andSection; 160.45(b), including them in andSection; 160.45(a) isunnecessary. ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Change andSection; 160.45(b) by deleting it or expandingit to include tests not confined to the indoor laboratory or greenhouse.<T3>Response:</T3> EPA agrees with the comment and is expanding the wordingof andSection; 160.45 to emphasize that this section is not intended to beconfining. Therefore, andSection; 160.45(a) is changed to read ``* * * areaswhere the test systems are located * * *,'' and andSection; 160.45(b) ischanged to read ``* * * ( included but not limited to fields, greenhouses,* * *).'' iii. <T3>Comment:</T3> The addition of the two new paragraphs outlining plantand aquatic facilities to andSection; 160.45(b) is unnecessary. These considerationsare addressed in andSection; 160.41 with the requirement that testing facilitiesbe of suitable construction ``to facilitate proper conduct of studies.''<T3>Response:</T3> EPA maintains that testing facilities as mentioned inandSection; 160.41 and test system supply facilities as mentioned in andSection;160.45, are not the same and must be addressed separately. iv. <T3>Comment:</T3> EPA should delete andSection; 160.45(b) introductory text,(b)(1), (b)(2), and (c) because this information was adequately coveredin andSection; 160.45(a) and in andSection; 160.43, and the facilities theyrefer to will be addressed in study protocol. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA maintains that andSection; 160.43 (test system care)is different from andSection; 160.45 (test system supply facilities) andmust therefore be treated separately. 4. <T3>Facilities for handling test, control, and reference substances_</T3>i.<T3>Comment:</T3> These requirements would severely restrict the abilityof efficacy investigators to test their product, since andSection; 160.47would require separation of facilities for test animals and testing material.The real issue for efficacy testing is test substance accountability, whichshould be a vital part of the efficacy testing protocol, and appropriaterecords maintained to verify test substance accountability. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA notes that similar concerns were raised by commentersregarding the 1983 rule. The wording ``as necessary'' was included thento allow latitude in facility design and operation. EPA agrees that othermeasures, i.e. protocol, SOPs, and appropriate records, must be adequateto demonstrate the integrity of test, control, and reference substancesduring handling. ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Would it be necessary to provide separate sink facilitiesor separate rooms for mixing of the test, control, and reference substancesor for adding water to tank sprayers? <T3>Response:</T3> Separate areas are required for receipt, mixing andstorage of test, control, and reference substances and their mixtures asnecessary to prevent contamination or mixups. The same sink could be usedfor all work involving mixing provided that the procedures (SOPs) usedare adequate to prevent contamination and mixups. Separate areas for receiptand storage and for mixing and storage of test, control, and referencesubstances as required in andSection; 160.47(a)(1), (2), and (3) does notmandate the use of separate rooms. The areas could be in the same roomprovided there is adequate space and equipment to provide that contaminationand mixup do not occur. This determination should be made on a case-by-casebasis.D. Equipment<T3>Maintenance and calibration of equipment_</T3>i. <T3>Comment:</T3> The entire section, andSection; 160.63(b), requires unnecessarydocumentation and/or is vague about what is required, especially for fieldportions of residue studies. Equipment used in these studies may only beused on an occasional basis, and routine inspection should only be ``beforeuse.'' Requiring calibration and maintenance logs for all equipment involvedin generating a residue sample would be prohibitive, would often be forgottenor overlooked and would then be a cause for not meeting audits. <T3>Response:</T3> The requirement states that equipment shall be ``adequatelyinspected, cleaned and maintained'' and ``adequately tested, calibratedand/or standardized.'' This requirement is not changed from the old rule.The laboratory has latitude in defining in its SOPs what is ``adequate''unless given specific guidance otherwise (i.e. in test rules or testingguidelines). However, EPA recommends that calibration and maintenance recordsbe available for all equipment used in field studies. This includes equipmentused only rarely and rental equipment. ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> It is better to designate in andSection; 160.63(b) thatrepair and maintenance will be performed by ``qualified personnel,'' thanto require that a person be designated in the written SOP. The requirementfor written SOPs in andSection; 160.63(b) causes problems since at many laboratoriesthe equipment used in conducting a study is shared by a number of individualsand the care and maintenance of the equipment is also shared. In the eventof equipment failure, a number of laboratory personnel may be capable ofrepairing or correcting a problem, or in more serious equipment failures,a service representative of the manufacturer may be called. It is thereforedifficult and very inefficient to designate specific people to performeach specific maintenance and repair operation. <T3>Response:</T3> The definition of ``person'' as it appears in andSection;160.3(h) is not limited to an individual scientist or technician, but includesan organizational subunit. Consequently, the SOP that designates the ``personresponsible'' will be designating a subunit of the testing facility, whichcould be one or several individuals. This view is consistent with FDA's(52 FR 33774) interpretation and definition of ``person.'' Where dutiesare delegated in the SOPs, all contingencies may be addressed, includingthe contracting of service personnel. iii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Certain pieces of equipment, such as tractors, land preparationand land measuring devices should be exempt from the calibration requirement,as should standard commercially available laboratory ware, such as graduatedcylinders, beakers, flasks, etc. Only equipment directly related to applicationof the test substance, such as sprayers or granular applicators shouldbe listed as requiring calibration. Therefore, andSection; 160.63(c) is notappropriate for field studies. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA believes that calibration should be required forthe application phase of field studies. However, the method of calibration,and hence the exact equipment to be calibrated, are not specified in GLPstandards, as long as the methods and records ensure the quality and integrityof the study. Some equipment, such as graduated cylinders and volumetricflasks are pre-calibrated and do not need to be recalibrated. Equipmentdirectly related to the application of the test substance may require calibration,but application rates may include other parameters. The methods used tomeasure all parameters inherent in the determination of application rateswould have to be adequately calibrated in order to ensure the quality andintegrity of the study. E. Testing Facilities Operation 1. <T3>Standard operating procedures_</T3>i. <T3>Comment:</T3> There are few standardized tests available to researchersrelated to novel microbial pesticides. An experimental use permit is requiredfor the evaluation of certain microbials at an earlier stage of researchthan is required for chemical evaluations. Therefore, it would be verycumbersome to require written SOPs for microbial pesticides, since themethodology may be in a state of flux. It may only be possible to developSOPs following the completion of a study. If methods of application andassessment need to be modified for each microbial developed, it would bebest to affirm that methods development could be performed in accordancewith accepted scientific standards without having SOPs as described inandSection; 160.81. EPA is encouraged to take a flexible, case-by-case approachto establishing appropriate GLP standards for a given set of experimentsconcerning development of microbial pesticides. Allowances could be madefor situations in which SOPs are inappropriate, such as in the early stagesof field work. These allowances, made in advance of the work, could thenbe positively affirmed as good laboratory practice, rather than as tolerated,non-compliance with GLP standards. This would alleviate the uncertaintyof performing experiments in a scientifically sound fashion, without knowinguntil the conclusion of the work whether the data would be acceptable toEPA. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA agrees that there are special problems associatedwith the early stage of method development. Method development phases ofan experiment are not under GLP standards as has been clarified in thedefinition of ``study'' in andSection; 160.3. SOPs are thus required forthose operations in which all steps have been worked out. However, SOPsare needed to ensure the quality and integrity of all studies performedunder GLP standards, for instance, after the method has been developed.There is flexibility in relation to SOPs insofar as changes can occur duringthe study as long as they are authorized by the study director (and management,if the changes are significant) and documented with raw data. Furthermore,methodology that is not generalized or established sufficiently to be includedin SOPs can be defined in the study protocol. ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Although unchanged from the old rule, the second halfof andSection; 160.81(a) should not apply in some cases. The justificationfor this is as follows: (a) Unforeseen circumstances cannot be authorized;(b) minor deviations do not need authorization by the study director; (c)people who conduct the studies are required to be appropriately trainedand are able to make decisions if necessary to deviate from the SOPs; (d)in field studies, deviations from SOPs will occur before the researcheris able to consult with the study director; (e) decisions about deviationsfrom SOPs that are made by field personnel would be based on standard agriculturalpractices. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA disagrees with the suggestion that some deviationsdo not require authorization by the study director. It is necessary forthe study director to authorize deviations from SOPs to ensure that thesedeviations do not have an adverse impact on the study. SOPs should be writtenwith sufficient flexibility to accommodate field studies by anticipatingconditions under which appropriate actions must be taken without the needfor authorization by the study director. Standard agricultural practicescan be referenced in SOPs as long as this does not lead to ambiguity concerningthe appropriate action to be taken in a given situation. If SOPs statethe constraints on action and a decision is made within these limits, thereis no deviation. This is in concert with FDA's GLP regulations (52 FR 33774)which require that the study director make certain that specified proceduresare followed and that all modifications to the procedures in the approvedstudy plan are documented and approved. iii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Some of the examples of required SOPs provided in andSection;160.81(b) are not applicable to all test systems or study types. For example,``test room preparation'' would not be appropriate when conducting fieldresidue studies, and ``necropsy of test system or post-mortem examinationof test systems,'' would not apply to studies using a chemical or physicalmatrix as the test system (sterile water, soil, agricultural fields). Furthermore,andSection; 160.81(c) states that, ``Each laboratory or other study areashall have immediately available manuals and SOPs relative to the laboratoryor field procedures being performed.'' <T3>Response:</T3> EPA agrees that the term ``room'' in andSection; 160.81(b)(1)is inappropriate to many studies and is changing the word to ``area'' inorder to clarify that field studies are included. EPA believes that andSection;l60.81(b) should apply in all cases since the purpose of SOPs is to insurethe quality and integrity of the data generated in the course of a studyas stated in andSection; 160.81(a). However, procedures that are not necessaryto be performed, such as necropsy in the case of field studies, do notrequire SOPs.iv. <T3>Comment:</T3> The term ``test systems'' should not replace ``animals''in andSection; 160.81(b) (6) and (7). Although this requirement is usefulfor preventing or slowing autolysis for toxicology studies, for other studies,such as metabolism, addressing the handling of moribund or dead test systemsis not appropriate. In these types of studies, if a test system were moribundor dead, the testing guidelines require the part of the study that wasimpacted to be repeated, and this requirement is only applicable to animals.<T3>Response:</T3> EPA disagrees with the comment. This rule applies toplants as well as animals. v. <T3>Comment:</T3> Published literature (e.g., ASTM methods) should be acceptablein andSection; 160.81(c) as an appropriate part of an SOP and not just asa supplement to a written SOP. The written SOP could incorporate the publishedliterature by reference, without having to rewrite the entire procedure.<T3>Response:</T3> EPA agrees that it would not be appropriate to rewritepublished literature, hence the allowance for SOPs to use it as supplements.The SOPs are still needed to establish the relationship of the method todata collection procedures and needs in the laboratory. While the resultingSOP would still have to be written, it would in effect be abbreviated inthat all of the methodology referenced would not need to be rewritten.2. <T3>Animal and other test system care_</T3>i. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 160.90(a) should be deleted since the subjectis covered in andSection; 160.81(b). <T3>Response:</T3> EPA recognizes that andSection; 160.81(b) requires testingfacilities to establish SOPs for animal or other test system care. Section160.90(a), however, expressly specifies that SOPs shall also cover testsystem housing, feeding and handling. This section is consistent with FDA'sGLP regulations and is not an additional requirement. ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 160.90(b) should be simplified to provide thattest systems be evaluated prior to use but not necessarily isolated. Forsome studies, such as plant metabolism, isolating the plants or soil isnot appropriate. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA disagrees. Isolation is necessary to insure thata test system is free from disease or other conditions that may impactthe study. Further, the inclusion of this is consistent with FDA's GLPregulations. iii. <T3>Comment:</T3> The evaluation of certain test systems according to ``acceptable* * * scientific practice'' creates some difficulty, particularly for plants,microorganisms, soil and water, since such practices are not defined. ``Acceptable''should be deleted regarding scientific practice and the requirement beonly that a scientific basis be used in determining appropriateness fortesting. In this way, testing facilities would not need to justify or provetheir basis to be ``acceptable'' in ill-defined areas or those in flux.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees that the term ``acceptable scientific practice''may not be definable when method developments are in flux. The term ``acceptable''is retained, but the term ``scientific practice'' is changed to ``scientificmethods.'' This change preserves EPA's intent that rigorous scientificmethodology be used without implying that rigid practices be adhered towhere they may not appropriately exist. iv. <T3>Comment:</T3> The requirement under andSection; 160.90(c) that the testarea be disease-free prior to study initiation is inappropriate for fieldstudies since it would be impossible to declare areas totally disease freeunder field conditions. Also, one of the objectives of performing studiesin the field is to conduct the studies under representative environmentalconditions which includes encountered disease and insect pressures, makingthis part in direct conflict with the study objective. <T3>Response:</T3> The requirement is for the test system to be ``freeof disease or condition that interfere with the purpose or conduct of thestudy.'' The current wording therefore provides sufficient latitude forfield studies. Furthermore, EPA does not intend compliance with this provisionto require deviation from accepted agricultural practices. If disease andinsect pressures are considered to be an integral part of a study, theyclearly do not interfere with the purpose and conduct of that study. Thetest system would therefore not need to be free of them. v. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 160.90(c) should be deleted since the effectof corrective treatment cannot be accounted for in test results. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA believes that while the effects of corrective actionstaken to isolate and treat disease or signs of disease may complicate interpretationof test results, so might the effects of the disease itself. This requirementfor field studies is not inconsistent with its inclusion for laboratory,i.e., toxicology, studies. vi. <T3>Comment:</T3> Markings which identify animals individually, ratherthan the group as required by andSection; 160.90(d), are needed in many studieswith warm-blooded vertebrates in pens, or in the field. For example, precocialyoung of avian species should be marked individually. <T3>Response:</T3> Specific criteria for marking of individuals to meetstudy requirements should be addressed separately in the protocol of thestudy. The requirement in andSection; 160.90(d) addresses the need that testsystems be adequately identified to prevent confounding with other testsystems. Identification of precocial birds, for example, may be outlinedin the study protocol. vii. <T3>Comment:</T3> The proposed multispecies housing under andSection; 160.90(e)(1)is redundant to proposed andSection; 160.43(a)(1) and is inconsistent withEPA's desire to streamline GLP standards. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA disagrees with the conclusion that these sectionsare redundant. While andSection; 160.43(a)(1) states that the facilitiesshall be sufficient to allow proper separation of species, andSection; 160.90(e)(1)refers specifically to test system care within the facilities. viii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Field studies should be exempt from the periodic testingrequirement of andSection; 160.90(g). A bioassay or chemical analysis priorto study initiation should suffice to show that contaminants are not presentat levels capable of interfering with the study. The need for prior analysismay even be obviated by documentation of the previous history of pesticideuse in the soil according to Standard Evaluation Procedures to ensure thatno interfering contaminants are present. <T3>Response: </T3>The regulations as written do not require that periodictests be performed during a study unless there are ``contaminants knownto be capable of interfering with the study and reasonably expected tobe present at levels above those specified in the protocol.'' If thereis no reasonable expectation that a problem exists, periodic testing isnot needed. An acceptable method to determine this, such as evaluationof the history of pesticide use, should be defined in the protocol or SOPs.ix. <T3>Comment:</T3> The requirement in andSection; 160.90(j) for acclimatizationof plants and animals should be deleted, since it is not defined and promotesconfusion. Animal toxicology tests would be subject to isolation and separatelyto acclimatization. Organisms in environmental studies will have been isolatedwith their health status being evaluated per andSection; 160.90(b) and acclimatizationwould have already been performed as part of the process. This part shouldbe amended to indicate that test organisms be acclimatized to all experimentalconditions except the test substance. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA believes that the term acclimatization has commonmeaning that is clear in the context of its usage in the regulation. Acclimatizationimplies accustoming to experimental, i.e., environmental, conditions otherthan the actual introduction of the effect (e.g., test substance) to bemeasured in the experiment. If acclimatization is achieved during the processof isolation, it should be so stated in the protocol and does not requireadditional technical effort. In addition, the term ``organisms'' in andSection; 160.90(j) has been changedto ``systems.'' This change is consistent with the intended expansion ofGLP standards and was an inadvertent omission in the proposed rule. F. Test and Control Substances 1. <T3>Test, control, and reference substance characterization_</T3>i. <T3>Comment:</T3> Requiring stability and solubility before testing wouldresult in a costly burden to the efficacy testing sponsor. The solubilitytesting portion of this requirement would not cause significant problems,but requiring stability testing to be completed before study initiationcould result in significant time and cost burdens. <T3>Response:</T3> It is more costly to have to repeat a study becauseof inadequate solubility or stability in respect to experimental needs.EPA agrees, however, that requiring stability testing to be completed beforethe study may result in unnecessary delays and is allowing concurrent stabilitytesting. Therefore, EPA has changed the requirement to allow stabilitytesting concurrently with the study. Solubility, where this is relevantto a study, must still be known before the experimental start date. Pleasenote that the 1983 GLP standards require determination of characteristicswhich will appropriately define the test or control article before studyinitiation. Thus solubility determination before a study, where it is relevantto the study and hence an appropriate characteristic, is not a new requirement.ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> The term ``purity'' should be expanded to include radiochemicalpurity since further definition is needed to encompass metabolism/environmentalfate studies conducted with radioactive materials. <T3>Response:</T3> Radiochemical purity is covered under ``other characteristicswhich appropriately define the test, control, or reference substance.''It is not necessary to specifically list this characteristic. iii. <T3>Comment:</T3> What level of analysis constitutes ``appropriate'' characterization?Is quality control batch analysis sufficient? Is it necessary to fullycharacterize technical materials to 0.1 percent?<T3>Response:</T3> The details of what ``appropriately'' defines the testsubstance is a guideline or protocol issue that cannot be specified ina generic document such as GLP standards. The appropriate level of characterizationis largely dependent on the nature of the study that the substance is tobe used for. iv.<T3> Comment:</T3> What needs to be characterized, the technical gradeactive ingredient or the end product? <T3>Response:</T3> The test substance needs to be characterized. If thetest substance is the end product, the end product needs to be characterized.v.<T3> Comment:</T3> The characterization requirement is inappropriate sinceit conflicts with management responsibilities, is costly, and adds unnecessarydelays to the development process. It removes a necessary option of planningby objectives that responsible business management must retain. Delaysand rescheduling, which may result if inadequate work is permitted by management,are real consequences that must be accepted by management, and managementmust decide whether or not to risk beginning an experiment prior to doingcharacterization studies. Since the ultimate validity of a study will requirethat such data be obtained before the study is completed and as long asthe sponsor can demonstrate that a study was conducted with authentic material,it is irrelevant when the characterization is completed. This proposalis not in concert with FDA GLP regulations. Many times prospective productsfail to reach the marketplace due to unusual or insurmountable problems.Therefore, eliminating the need for characterization of product will reducethe costs of products that fall out of developmental process. <T3>Response:</T3> Characterization is necessary to ensure integrity ofstudies. It is also necessary for EPA to have characterization data availablefor inspectional purposes during ongoing studies, and thus to have thisinformation complete at the beginning of the study. Without characterization,it is not possible to know whether test, control, or reference substancesfrom different batches that are used in a single study are in fact identical.Adequate testing for characterization normally occurs during the synthesisor production of test, control, and reference substances, and thus shouldalready be available before the test begins. Consequently, having characterizationdata available should not impose an additional burden in most cases. EPA does agree, however, that stability testing should be allowed to beperformed concurrently, to prevent unreasonable delays. The sponsor willbear the burden of a repeated test in the case that concurrent stabilitytesting suggests that the study is not valid. For that reason, EPA is revisingandSection; 160.105(b) to allow for concomitant determination of stability.vi.<T3> Comment:</T3> The last sentence of andSection; 160.105(a), relatingto methods and fabrication, should be deleted since these may contain CBI.<T3>Response:</T3> This is not a new requirement and has not posed anyproblems. Inspectors are cleared to handle CBI material; any sensitiveinformation can be declared CBI and treated as such. vii.<T3> Comment:</T3> Some EPA auditors are interpreting this section to requirethat the testing facility not only archive certification records concerningthe purity or assay of an analytical standard (reference substance), butto also archive copies of the raw data and records generated during thecertification process. The sponsor or chemical supplier should only berequired to archive the raw data supporting the certification of an analyticalstandard. The testing facility need only archive a copy of the certificationof the standard. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA agrees with the comment, and is modifying andSection;160.105(a) to allow for specification of the availability of the documentationsupporting the characterization if it is not available at the testing facility.The phrase ``and such documentation availability shall be specified'' isadded to the end of the first sentence in andSection; 160.105(a), followingthe word ``* * * experiment.'' viii.<T3> Comment:</T3> Many of the tests coming under the scope of the proposedGLP standards are in themselves stability studies. Soil dissipation testsare stability determinations of herbicides, as are tests of microbial geneticmarkers for measuring persistence of recombinantly derived organisms. Theproposal places industry in the quandary of conducting stability studiesprior to a stability study. <T3>Response:</T3> The performance tests cited cannot be considered tobe stability tests under the GLP standards. In the context described above,the persistence of the substance in the environment is a separately measuredparameter. However, when performing such tests, it is still important toknow the stability of the substance to ensure that the measured effectwas due to the effect of the test system. ix.<T3> Comment:</T3> Would it be acceptable to EPA if the stability knowledgeis based on the extrapolation of the results of a short-term stabilitystudy under extreme conditions carried out before the experimental startingdate? <T3>Response:</T3> Such an accelerated study would not demonstrate stabilityunder test conditions, and could not be part of the concurrent stabilitytesting performed in conjunction with a larger study. It would be a separatestudy with its own protocol. x.<T3> Comment:</T3> The proposed rule does not address whether quality controlactivities fall under the GLP standards. <T3>Response: </T3>Not all quality control activities are GLP issues. Qualitycontrol work that is integral to the laboratory performing the study wouldbe under GLP standards, but not that performed during manufacturing. Studiesas defined in this part are subject to GLP standards only when requiredto be submitted to fulfill data requirements. xi. <T3>Comment: </T3>The part related to ``storage container assignment forthe duration of a study'' in andSection; 160.105(c) would be unrealisticfor field studies, especially where storage containers may be large tanks,or delivery systems which are possibly not even owned by the sponsor ortesting facility. <T3>Response: </T3>The delivery systems and tanks that are part of deliverysystems are not ``storage containers.'' Test, control, and reference substancewill, however, be stored before use in some container that is unique tothat substance during the test. This may be the container that it comesin or that is assigned to it by the testing facility. xii. <T3>Comment: </T3>Liquids from large containers are often placed into smallercontainers for use during the study. Consolidation of the test substanceinto smaller containers as the supply is depleted should be allowed. Thesecontainers need not be retained after they are empty, since their retentiondoes not enhance the quality or integrity of the data collected. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA disagrees with the suggestion. The retention ofcontainers is necessary to ensure the integrity of the study. This includesempty containers, which must be kept to verify the disposition of the test,control, and reference substance. Disposal of containers adversely affectsaccountability. This provision of the rule is not changed from the 1983rule, but was commented on by the public because it may affect types ofstudies, such as field studies, that will now fall under the provisionsof the rule as a result of these amendments. xiii. <T3>Comment: </T3>How are ``studies of more than 4 weeks duration'' specifiedin andSection; 160.105(d) defined? They should be defined as studies havingan ``in-life phase'' of more than 4 weeks. <T3>Response: </T3>The term ``4 weeks duration'' is meant to apply to theexperimental start and experimental termination dates. The suggestion ofusing the term ``in-life phase'' is not accepted since this introducesnew terminology that is not adequately defined. The term ``4 weeks experimentalduration'' replaces ``4 weeks duration'' in andSection; 160.105(d) to clarifythat the study initiation and study completion dates are not implied. xiv. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 160.105 (b) and (e) do not provide necessarydiscretion to testing personnel to determine what data are needed to characterizestability for a substance, and how the determination is made. The phrase``under test conditions'' needs additional clarification, since a varietyof temperature, humidity, moisture, and other test conditions may be encounteredacross the United States. Routine product chemistry testing for emulsionstability, hydrolysis, photostability, etc., should satisfy this requirement.<T3>Response: </T3>The terminology ``under test conditions'' is ambiguousand may be misinterpreted, so EPA has decided to delete ``under test conditions''from andSection; 160.105(e) and replace it with ``under storage conditionsat the test site.'' This may be adequately addressed by routine productchemistry testing as long as storage of the substance at the test siteis in known, acceptable conditions. xv. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 160.105(e) should be deleted since it was redundantwith andSection; 160.113(a)(2). <T3>Response: </T3>EPA disagrees that these sections are redundant. Section160.105(e) refers to the test, control, and reference substance, whileandSection; 160.113 refers to mixtures. xvi. <T3>Comment: </T3>Knowledge of stability makes sense for long-term, butnot short term studies because if stability is suspect then doses are madeup each day and given or sprayed immediately. Adequate knowledge of stabilitymay exist from chemical information about the test substance. <T3>Response: </T3>If a substance is known to be stable for a few days,then its stability is known in terms of the test requirements. If the stabilityis not known, it must be determined, even for short-term studies. Storagestability needs to be known even if the materiaI is used ``immediateIy''.If enough information is known about the material to support its stabilityfrom other testing, its stability is known and the requirement is met.However, theoretical stability is not considered to be adequate. The methodused to compensate for poor stability, such as daily mixing or immediateapplication, is addressed in guidelines rather than in GLP standards. 2. <T3>Test, control, and reference substance handling_Comment: </T3>If thetest, control, or reference substance is inherently unstable, it may notbe possible to ``preclude deterioration.'' Therefore, the regulation shouldallow for periodic evaluation of the purity of the test substance duringa study to assure its integrity and replace it when shown to be warranted.<T3>Response: </T3>The intent is to prevent deterioration due to handling.Periodic testing is allowed under andSection; 160.105(b) as changed in thefinal rule. 3. <T3>Mixtures of substances with carriers_</T3>i. <T3>Comment: </T3>Does andSection; 160.113 require determination of uniformity,stability, and solubility during field residue studies? If so, does itrequire analyses for each tank preparation? This requirement would imposea large burden on testing facilities performing these types of studies.<T3>Response: </T3>The purpose of this section is to assure that the methodologyused to prepare the mixture is valid. Once the methodology has been provenfor a particular mixture, it need not be reconfirmed each time that mixtureis prepared. For field residue trials, there will be data submitted toEPA that support the uniformity, stability, and solubility of a substancein the carrier when prepared by appropriate methodology, i.e. accordingto the proposed use or label. In such cases it may not be necessary totest each batch that is prepared for field application. However, fieldresidue trials do remain subject to the requirements of this section. Whereavailable data are inadequate to support uniformity, stability, and solubilityin a particular case, then it is necessary for the data to be generatedunder this section. Also, there may be protocol stipulations applicableto a particular study that require tank mixture analyses in addition toany provisions of this section. ii. <T3>Comment: </T3>The range of environmental conditions encountered infield trials are great and would require extensive evaluations of stabilityand solubility under numerous environmental conditions. This amount ofdata could not be evaluated prior to study initiation. <T3>Response: </T3>Section 160.113(a)(2) states that the determination(s)shall be ``* * * under the environmental conditions specified in the protocoland as required by the conditions of the test.'' All possible environmenta1conditions do not have to be anticipated and tested unless required inthe protocol. iii. <T3>Comment: </T3>Short-term toxicity and field residue studies shouldbe exempted from this section since supplementary analyses are performedfor other studies with the same test substance. The analytical cost couldequal or exceed the cost of the remainder of the short-term study. <T3>Response: </T3>The GLP standards do not require characterization foreach study. The characterization is required for each test, control, andreference substance. The same substance may need to be characterized onlyonce, even if used on multiple studies. iv. <T3>Comment: </T3>The requirement for stability and solubility should allowflexibility for the sponsor to make the determination either before, during,or after the study. When to determine the stability is a business decisionbased on knowledge of the risk of having to repeat a study, if the stabilitydata negatively impacts the integrity of the study. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA understands that requiring stability testing tobe completed prior to a study may introduce unreasonable delays. In harmonywith the modification of andSection; 160.105(b) to allow concurrent stabilitytesting of test, control, and reference substances, andSection; 160.113(a)(2)is changed to allow stability testing of mixtures to be performed concomitantlywith the study. This allows the necessary flexibility and is also consistentwith FDA's GLP regulations. v. <T3>Comment: </T3>In the very early stages of a compound's developmentthere is a need for basic acute toxicity tests. However, there are no analyticalmethods and calibrated reference standards available to test the stabilityof the test substances in the carrier according to GLP standards. An estimateof the stability of the compound in an inert carrier like starch, oil,or polyethylene glycol is possible and should be sufficient as a preliminaryapproach. The stability test will be carried out as early as the analyticalmethods are available.<T3>Response: </T3>If a carrier is used, the mixture with the carrier mustgo through the same test, i.e. stability, solubility, etc. Instabilityof the mixture in a specific carrier is important since it may affect theapparent effects of the test substance. vi. <T3>Comment: </T3>The assurances called for in andSection; 160.113(c) arenot well defined. How would the addition of the vehicle used to facilitatemixing of the test substance with the carrier to the control system affectthis requirement? If the vehicle is identically mixed in control, is therea need to show noninterference? <T3>Response: </T3>Any vehicle used to facilitate mixing must be shownnot to interfere with the study. This includes a vehicle control to determineinteraction effect. vii. <T3>Comment: </T3>If a test substance is applied to a soil, is the soila carrier or test system? <T3>Response: </T3>This section does not generally consider ``soil'' tobe a carrier; it is considered to be part of the test system. G. Protocol for and Conduct of a Study 1. <T3>Protocol_General</T3>_i. <T3>Comment: </T3>The proposed regulations do not offer sufficient latitudefor the generation of protocols. The regulations state that a protocolmust exist prior to study conduct, yet it would be almost impossible tospecify the exact analyses that would be performed on biological samplescollected in the field until the samples were collected. <T3>Response: </T3>The protocol requirement is not too restrictive to allowfor situations where the exact analysis performed may not be known in advance.The type or nature of analysis still needs to be specified in the protocol.The protocol should state what samples are intended to be collected, howthey are to be collected, and how they are intended to be anaIyzed. Ifthere is a need for latitude, (for instance it is not known specificallyhow many samples will result from a particular study) that should be anticipatedand stated in the protocol. ii. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 160.120(a)(5), (7), (10), and (11) should notapply to product chemistry experiments. <T3>Response: </T3>The term ``test system'' is redefined to include anyphysical matrix, which may thus be applicable to product chemistry studies.However, note that a study designed solely for the determination of certainchemical or physical characteristics of a test substance are exempted fromandSection; 160.120(a) (5), (7), (10), and (11) as described in andSection;160.135. In addition, the word ``of'' prior to ``frequency'' should be ``and.''This was a typographical error noticed by one commenter and has been correctedin this final rule. iii. <T3>Comment: </T3>Guidance is needed in the final preamble for presentingaddresses, as required by andSection; 160.120(a)(3), of field and environmentallocations used to conduct tests. <T3>Response: </T3>The address of the testing facility is the address ofthe ``person'' (i.e. organizational unit or subunit) who actually conductsthe study. Even if this organizational unit includes parts situated indifferent locations it may still be considered to have one address. Theaddress should be a permanent address and would probably be synonymouswith the address of the study director and/or testing facility's management.iv. <T3>Comment: </T3>``Address of sponsor'' should be removed from this Partto maintain consistency with FDA GLP regulations. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA maintains that the address of the sponsor is essentialto its inspectional process, which differs from that of FDA. v. <T3>Comment: </T3>The requirement in andSection; 160.120(a)(4) to state proposedexperimental start and termination dates poses problems for field studieswhere these dates cannot be predicted with certainty. Would this resultin protocol deviations whenever these dates are not exactly met? <T3>Response: </T3>The requirement to document the proposed experimentalstart and termination dates in the protocol does not suggest that a protocoldeviation occurs when the date is not met. The term ``proposed'' signifiesthat this date is estimated. However, gross deviation from the proposeddate may be a violation of the protocol, if there are date-critical aspectsof the study that are identified as such. vi. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 160.120(a)(5) is inappropriate because: (a) Justificationshould be required only when more than one test system can be used in astudy and not, for example, in residue chemistry studies where residuelevels in specific target crops are the subject of a study; (b) Justificationshould only be required for those that deviate from, or fall outside thenormal EPA guidelines and not where standard test systems (Pesticide AssessmentGuidelines and Standard Evaluation Procedures) are used; (c) The retentionof this requirement does not promote harmony between the EPA and FDA GLPregulations. <T3>Response: </T3>Environmental studies are more diverse than health effectstesting and are subject to details relevant to test system design thatare more chemically dependent than is the case in health effects studies.Furthermore, this is not seen to impose a burden in the cases describedin this comment. In the case where only one test system can be used, thatis the justification that should be stated. The targeting of a specificcrop may be part of the justification and so stated; it is still necessaryto state that the test system (e.g., strain of crop, soil, location) usedis justified for the purpose of the study. If a standard test system isused because it is the referenced system in EPA or Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines, citing the use of such guidelinesis sufficient justification. Thus, detailed discussions are required onlyin the relatively few cases where the study design requires deviation orspecial choices to be made in selection of the test system. vii. <T3>Comment: </T3>EPA should add ``range'' to andSection; 160.120(a)(6) soit reads  ``* * * body weight range,'' since without specifying range,the protocol requirement could be misinterpreted to mean that all individualbody weights of the test system should be included. This would not be possiblesince exact weights of test systems would not be known when the protocolis prepared. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA did not intend a change here and retains the term``body weight range'' as used in the 1983 rule. viii. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 160.120(a)(7) should be deleted since the testsystem will be identified and justification for its selection will be inthe protocol. <T3>Response: </T3>Identification of the test system is not covered inany of the other parts of andSection; 160.120. Identification is the specificdescription of which individual test system is used, not a general descriptionof the kind of test system. ix. <T3>Comment: </T3>The method for controlling bias is usuaIly in the SOP,therefore inclusion of a reference in the protocol to the SOP should suffice.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees that this is allowed. The SOP may be referredto in the protocol in such cases. x. <T3>Comment: </T3>The term ``nutrients'' should be added to the list forthe description of the diet used in the study to cover the use of fertilizerin plant studies. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA has incorporated this suggestion into the finalrule. xi. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 160.120(a)(10) should be deleted, or amendedwith ``if appropriate'' because: (a) The reason for selecting the routeof administration is the objective of the study; (b) route of administrationand reason for its choice is not applicable to studies such as aqueoushydrolysis and anaerobic aquatic; (c) EPA Pesticide Assessment Guidelinesrequire the use of certain routes. <T3>Response: </T3>Unlike FDA, EPA requires many tests where a predefinedroute of exposure is not available. Multiple exposure routes may be possiblefor many test substances. It is appropriate to state that the route ismandated by guidelines or by the purpose of the study if either of theseare the case. xii. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 160.120(a)(10) should be modified to read ``** * route of administration and/or exposure * * *'' to encompass othertypes of protocols. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA disagrees with the suggestion since the experimentercontrols administration but does not have control of the route of exposure.Administration routes cover the potential of all exposure routes and henceis a more general, all-inclusive term in this case. xiii. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 160.120(a) should be reworded so that it reads:``The route or method of administration/ application and the reason forchoice, if appropriate.'' <T3>Response: </T3>EPA disagrees with the suggestion. The route of administrationis not the same concept as method of application or administration. Itwould not be appropriate to introduce statements concerning methodologyto this section. xiv. <T3>Comment:</T3> In the case where the study director is part of a contractlaboratory engaged for the study by the sponsor, it should be clarifiedthat such signature as required under andSection; 160.120(a)(14) does notconstitute review and approval of those parts of the protocol not relatedto the work done by the contract lab. For example, the study director forthe chemical analysis of pesticide residues in plants may not be trainedin the experimental design of the sponsor's overall study, although heor she may be qualified to conduct the subpart of the study contractedto the laboratory. Such a dilemma may similarly arise in andSection; 160.120(a)(5),(7), (10), and (15). <T3>Response: </T3>EPA believes that the study director cannot, by definition,be an individual who is not trained or cognizant of the overall study.A study is not subdivided into multiple studies with multiple study directors.The definitions of ``study'' and ``study director'' preclude such a separationof responsibility. xv. <T3>Comment:</T3> ``Where applicable'' should be added to andSection; 160.120(a)(15)since statistical methods are not used in field studies. <T3>Response: </T3>Statistical methods are and should be used in fieldstudies. However, where the use of statistics is limited this can be sostated. The phrase ``to be used'' should modify the term ``statistical method''as in andSection; 160.120(a)(16) of the 1983 rule. This was a typographicalerror noted by one commenter and has been corrected. xvi. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 160.120(a)(15) is redundant since all of andSection;160.185(a)(3) requires statistical methods employed for analyzing the data.<T3>Response: </T3>Section 160.185 describes reporting requirements afterthe study, while andSection; 160.120 describes protocol requirements beforethe study. 2. <T3>Physical and chemical characterization studies_ </T3>i. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 160.135 is confusing and needs to be read severaltimes in order to understand it. EPA should clarify its intent by specifyingthose studies to be conducted under GLP standards, and by removing thedouble negatives currently presented in andSection; 160.135(a) and (b). <T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees with the comment. The section is changedto eliminate the double negative and reworded for clarity while retainingthe intent of the proposed changes. ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Should exemptions also apply to ``assembly line'' biologicalstudies, such as the Ames test, acute lethality, eye irritation, etc? <T3>Response: </T3>EPA does not intend to expand exemptions to biologicaltests previously covered by GLP standards, even when repetitive in nature.Section 160.135 applies only to physical and chemical characterizationstudies and is intended to ease the burden on many studies that will nowcome under GLP standards. iii. <T3>Comment:</T3> The concept of what constitutes a study is blurred bythis section. Partial deletion of protocol requirements implies that aprotocol is still required for these ``exempted measurements.'' <T3>Response: </T3>EPA intends that a protocol still be required for thepartially exempted studies. Some, but not all, of the full protocol requirementsare eliminated. iv. <T3>Comment:</T3> Areas for receipt and storage of test substances havebeen deleted in andSection; 160.47(a)(1), but corresponding SOPs are stillrequired by andSection; 160.81(b)(3). <T3>Response: </T3>EPA maintains that SOPs for test, control and referencesubstance handling are still important, if not more important, when facilitiesfor their handling are not specified. v. <T3>Comment:</T3> Stability is to be known under conditions of the testunder andSection; 160.105(e), but the requirement to report that informationis deleted in andSection; 160.185(a)(5)) and the requirement to determinestability is removed by deleting andSection; 160.105(b). <T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees, but there is no contradiction. The requirementsfor determination and reporting of stability are relaxed although stabilitystill needs to be known. vi. <T3>Comment:</T3> A protocol is required even though certain specific elementshave been deleted (andSection; 160.120(a)(5) through (12) and (15)), butthe requirement for the quality assurance unit to retain the protocol isdeleted (andSection; 160.195(d)). <T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees that this is true. The QAU recordkeepingrequirements are relaxed although the protocol still needs to be written.vii. <T3>Comment:</T3> A quality assurance unit is required by andSection; 160.35(a),but by deleting andSection; 160.31(c) management will not have to assurethe existence of a QAU. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA eliminated andSection; 160.31(c) because it requiresmanagement to ``assure that there is a quality assurance unit as describedin andSection; 160.35.'' This would have contradicted the exclusion of certainportions of andSection; 160.35 as specified (i.e. andSection; 160.35(b) and(c)). That which is not excluded under andSection; 160.35 must comply withandSection; 160.35(a). viii. <T3>Comment:</T3> A study director is required according to andSection;andSection;160.12 and 160.33, but does not have to be shown in the final report bythe deletion of andSection; 160.185(a)(10). <T3>Response: </T3>The study director is still required to sign the compliancestatement submitted with the final report as required in andSection; 160.12and is thus required to be named in the final report. A number of individualsare listed in andSection; 160.185(a)(10) in addition to the study director.This section was exempted to reduce reporting requirements. ix. <T3>Comment:</T3> Studies designed to determine stability, octanol waterpartition coefficient, volatility, and environmental persistence (biodegradation,photodegradation, or chemical degradation studies) should exclude andSection;160.43(a)(1) through (c) and (f) through (h), 160.45, 160.81(b)(1), (2),(6), (7), and (9), and 160.90. Only the physical and chemical propertiesthat are used to predict the environmental fate of a test substance shouldbe developed in compliance with these regulations. Those properties whichare not clearly used for this purpose should be excluded. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA does not agree that the listed sections are irrelevantin their entirety to the listed studies. Those portions of the sectionswhich are plainly not applicable to these studies (e.g. animal care facilities)do not place any burden on these studies. x. <T3>Comment:</T3> The removal of physical and chemical characterizationfrom the responsibilities of the QAU should not be accepted because itpresents a major problem for the QAU personnel. The QAU should be responsiblefor every study within the laboratory with no exception. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA disagrees with the conclusion that the QAU has noresponsibilities in physical and chemical characterization studies. Theexclusions reduce the responsibilities of the QAU, i.e. master schedulerequirements, etc., but do not eliminate them. xi. <T3>Comment:</T3> The QAU should be responsible for looking at the functionalcomponents of the laboratory (e.g., all melting points, all GC/MS analyses,etc.) rather than focusing on a particular study, such as with toxicologystudies. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees and is modifying the inspectional requirementsof the QAU under andSection; 160.35. This change specifies that the QAU conductinspections and maintain records that are appropriate to particular studies.This gives latitude to the QAU with respect to how the information is gathered;i.e., as part of the standard review procedures of the laboratory, or asneeded for the test. This change should reduce the burden in cases whereit is appropriate to maintain central records regarding functional componentsthat affect several studies rather than requiring such records to be maintainedseparately. xii. <T3>Comment:</T3> If physical and chemical characteristics are to be coveredby GLP standards, they should not be referred to as separate ``characterizationstudies.'' These tests are listed in 40 CFR part 158 as physical and chemicalcharacteristics and properties and are submitted to EPA in studies by Guidelineseries numbers, not necessarily as individual ``characterization studies.''Additionally, in product chemistry many of the characteristics listed inproposed andSection; 160.135(b) are part of Series 63 (i.e. stability, solubility,etc.), which is submitted as a single study. If these characteristics areto be covered by GLP standards, it should only be to the extent of thedata requirements in 40 CFR 158, because it is not the purpose of the GLPstandards to define studies for registration. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA disagrees with this comment. GLP standards do notexpand data requirements. The regulations only specify how the data areto be generated. xiii. <T3>Comment:</T3> All product chemistry should be exempted from these regulations,except for those studies specifically noted in the preamble (i.e. stability,solubility, octanol water partition coefficient, volatility and persistence),which also affect the environmental hazard assessment and/or are requiredby other sections of the guidelines. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA maintains that all data that are required to besubmitted to EPA be collected according to GLP standards. While EPA believesthat a portion of the requirements of the previous GLP standards can bereduced for some studies, the standards are still important to assure thequality and integrity of the data generated. xiv. <T3>Comment:</T3> The series 60, 61, 62, and 63 requirements are mainlyprocess and method development type experiments, and are developed overa period of time with portions sometimes contributed from laboratoriesin plant locations, making it prohibitively expensive and unrealistic tohave these portions under a GLP program. <T3>Response:</T3> While there may be additional cost, the need to havethe work performed under GLP standards overrides this concern. EPA doesnot agree that GLP requirements in this section entail unrealistic requirementson laboratories that perform these types of experiments. xv. <T3>Comment:</T3> The data quality from the series 60, 61, 62 and 63 studieswould not be compromised since the companies that are generating thesedata are usually doing so for their own economic benefit as well as forregistration purposes. <T3>Response:</T3> Data developed under manufacturer's demands for qualitycontrol information do not reflect the same constraints upon data integrityas required by EPA. During the manufacturing process, cost and time considerationsmay conflict with safety assessment data quality needs. xvi. <T3>Comment:</T3> EPA should revise PR Notice 86-5 to ensure that the definitionof study corresponds with the definition in the GLP regulations. <T3>Response:</T3> The GLP regulations address the integrity of data generatedduring a study. PR Notice 86-5 addresses the reporting of the data, whichis a separate concern. xvii. <T3>Comment:</T3> The term ``studies'' in the title of andSection; 160.135should be replaced with another term, such as ``experiments,'' to avoidthe misconception that these experiments must be carried out as separate``studies.'' As separate studies, they would require separate protocols,study directors, study reports, QAU audits, etc., when in fact these experimentsare part of a larger study, which already has its own protocol coveringall the various experiments to be performed. It may be that this part shouldbe deleted because these tests do not fit the basic definition of studyand should not be included, in any way, under the scope of the GLP standards.<T3>Response:</T3> EPA disagrees that these tests are not studies. Thedefinition of study includes the phrase ``to determine or help predict[the test substance's] effect * * * and fate.'' Therefore the physicaland chemical characterization parameters are included. EPA agrees thatin some cases, the determinations will have been performed as part of alarger study (e.g. product chemistry) and consequently will have been performedunder the protocol of the larger study. In other cases, however, each ofthese studies will require a separate protocol. xviii. <T3>Comment:</T3> Are GLP requirements applicable when analyses are conductedby an outside laboratory, or are they exempted from the various sectionsoutlined in andSection; 160.135(a)? <T3>Response:</T3> The location where the analyses are performed does notaffect the applicability of the GLP regulations. xix. <T3>Comment:</T3> Section 160.135(a) in the proposed rule should be deletedbecause the regulation is far too complex to start applying parts of itto one study, but not to another. It is a major task to instruct personnelon the requirements in the GLP standards; and it would be an impossibletask to instruct them on multiple versions of GLP standards. <T3>Response:</T3> There should not be many cases where the same workerswill need to be trained in both levels of GLP interpretation. There arenot ``multiple versions'' of GLP standards, only a relaxation of some requirementsfor some studies. EPA does not consider this to be imposing an additionalburden. xx. <T3>Comment:</T3> Under andSection; 160.135(b), an unusual situation canoccur with quality assurance because a QAU is required to exist by retentionof andSection; 160.35(a) and is implied to have records of inspection byretention of andSection; 160.35(d), but has no duties by virtue of deletingandSection; 160.35 (b) and (c). Both andSection; 160.35 (a) and (d) shouldbe added to the list of excluded provisions. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA agrees that there are inconsistencies in eliminatingandSection; 160.35 (b) and (c) since there are no inspectional responsibilitiesincluded in andSection; 160.35 (a) or (d). Consequently, EPA is expandingandSection; 160.35(a) to include inspectional responsibilities. xxi. <T3>Comment:</T3> The repetitive inspection of the types of studies requiredin proposed andSection; 160.135(b) would consume large amounts of time forboth study personnel and the QAU staff without contributing to the qualityand integrity of the data. The periodic inspection of such operations wouldprovide the necessary assurance that the data were of sufficient qualityand integrity to meet all requirements under GLP standards. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA disagrees with the comment and expects that eachstudy be inspected by the QAU at least once. Where these types of testsare repetitive or routine in nature it should be possible for the QAU inspectionalprocess to be equally routine. xxii. <T3>Comment:</T3> EPA should modify proposed andSection; 160.135(b) to makeit perfectly clear that stability/solubility experiments carried out aspart of a study are not excluded from the exemption provided by andSection;160.135(a). When the sole purpose of a study is to determine stabilityor solubility, GLP standards should apply, but where stability or solubilitydeterminations are being made prior to the initiation of the actual experimentfor which the study is being conducted, there is no reason to treat thosedeterminations as a separate study. The study protocol will cover the needfor, and method of, determining stability and solubility in situationswhere it is necessary to make those determinations in order to ensure thesuccess of the study. <T3>Response:</T3> EPA agrees that ``sole purpose'' stability/ solubilitystudies are under GLP standards, but disagrees that these studies shouldbe exempt when they are part of another GLP study. If they are a part ofa larger study, they are within its protocol, and hence under GLP standards.If they are not within that protocol, then they are ``sole studies'' underGLP standards in their own right.H. Records and Reports 1. <T3>Reporting of study results</T3>_i. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 160.185 delineates the information to be includedin the final report. Since the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) has alreadydesigned Data Reporting Guidelines (DRGs) as addenda to the Pesticide AssessmentGuidelines and these are being used by applicants, this section appearsto be unnecessary. Furthermore, there are a few issues where the GLP standardsand DRGs are not compatible and illustrate a possible conflict in EPA requirements:(a) Section 160.185(a)(2)_(protocol)_The reviewer at OPP needs to knowthe study objectives, not necessarily what the objectives were in the protocoland what changes were made during the course of the study; (b) Section160.185(a)(6)_(methodology)_A description of the methods used is required,but residue chemistry reports require a separate report for methodology;(c) Section 160.185(c)_(report amendments)_Information Services Branchhas specific requirements in PR Notice 86-5 regarding the submission ofamended reports. In cases such as these, which document has the supersedingauthority? <T3>Response: </T3>DRGs are designed for presentation of data to EPA afterthe performance of the study, and GLP standards are designed to ensuredata integrity during the performance of the study. GLP standards requireadditional information to be contained in the final report that are notrequired by the DRGs. This should not result in any issues of supersedingauthority. ii. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 160.185(a)(12) should be modified to requirereports only when they are necessary to explain results that are highlysubject to interpretation or critical to the final evaluation of the study.Otherwise this will result in an unusual reporting burden with little benefitduring field residue studies. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA does not agree that the requirement is impracticalor unnecessary. This reporting requirement cannot be left entirely to thediscretion of the study director. iii. <T3>Comment: </T3>At the EPA's second data submitters' workshop on theimplementation of PR Notice 86-5 on December 15, 1986, EPA handed out the``Clarification of PR Notice 86-5 Requirements'' pertaining to GLP considerations.EPA states in this clarification that reformatting final study reportsto comply with the submission requirements of PR Notice 86-5 does not constitutea formal ``correction or addition'' to a final report that would otherwiserequire the signature of the study director under 40 CFR 160.185(c). <T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees and is incorporating the suggestion in thefinal rule so that modification to comply with EPA submission requirementsdoes not constitute a correction, addition, or amendment. However, EPAadvises that the process of reformatting final study reports does not alleviatethe study director of accountability in signing the final report or thecompliance statement. 2. <T3>Storage and retrieval of records and data</T3>_i. <T3>Comment: </T3>The phrase ``beyond quality assurance'' in andSection;160.190(a) needs clarification since it could be ambiguously interpreted.Does it mean the date of the final approved report or does it mean beyondinitial evaluation of the specimens, since that was the statement usedin the corresponding preamble section? <T3>Response: </T3>EPA intends that the specimens be retained until thequality assurance unit assures that their discarding does not negativelyimpact the integrity of the study. The wording is being changed to ``afterquality assurance verification'' to clarify this. ii. <T3>Comment: </T3>Tissues and animal feeds collected from non-toxicologystudies should also be discarded after quality assurance verification.If EPA does not intend for animal tissues to be retained from residue studies,``animal'' not appearing after ``plants'' is an oversight. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA did not include the term ``animal'' in the listsince it would potentially include tissues and feeds from toxicology studieswhich must be kept. It is felt that the suggested wording would not providesufficient breadth to cover non-residue samples. Therefore, EPA will requirethat all animal tissue samples, even from non-toxicology studies, be includedin this Part. iii. <T3>Comment: </T3>Retention time for \14\C-labelled specimens needs tobe addressed since a facility's license limit could be exceeded for storingradioactive material. <T3>Response: </T3>The problem of licensing requirements is a facilityresponsibility under GLP standards. EPA does not agree that special considerationbe given to sample storage based on the above reasoning. iv. <T3>Comment: </T3>This Part does not clearly define who must archive rawdata or authenticated copies. If the test facility's portion of the studyis small compared to the entire project, it does not make sense to archiveat the test facility. The sponsor should be required to archive all rawdata in support of a submission and provide that data to the test facilityin the event of an audit. Archiving at the test facility will put an undueand unnecessary hardship on small laboratory facilities. Another problemto be considered is whether the test facility is required to archive thefinal report submitted to EPA. It could find itself archiving analyticaldata generated by another facility. Furthermore, in the event that thesponsor may be involved in a lawsuit concerning the study, the contingentliability exposure for the test facility should be clarified. <T3>Response: </T3>The test facility may contract with a commercial archiverunder andSection; 160.195 (b) and (g). This implies flexibility in the physicallocation of the archives. 3. <T3>Retention of records_</T3>i. <T3>Comment:</T3> The appropriate endpoint for specimen retention in andSection;160.195 should be based on the integrity of the specimens and use by thestudy director, or other technical personnel, not based on when QAU personnelmay perform a review. <T3>Response:</T3> Quality assurance evaluation is needed to assure thatthe integrity of the data are not compromised by the decision to discardspecimens. For consistency, EPA is changing the wording of andSection; 160.195(c)to concur with the wording of andSection; 160.190(a). ii. <T3>Comment:</T3> EPA should explicitly state in andSection; 160.195(i) thatwhen exact copies are substituted for original source as raw data, thenthe original may be discarded. In the past, EPA inspectors have requiredretention of original data sources even if exact copies existed. The burdenimposed by some EPA auditors, that each copy must be signed and dated,is unrealistic. Verification of ``batches'' of reproduction copies is justas meaningful and would eliminate most of the unnecessary burden on personneland time resources. <T3>Response:</T3> Specific wording advising the discarding of raw dataafter copying is not necessary or useful. ``True copies'' will be acceptableas raw data by EPA inspectors under andSection; 160.190. Signing and datingeach copy may be impractical and an acceptable alternative method may bedevised and incorporated into standard operating procedures to ensure theintegrity of the copies. Laboratories are cautioned that discarding originalsplaces an additional burden on verification of the authenticity of thecopies. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Requirements </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.EPA has determined that the amendments are not a major rule because theydo not meet any of the criteria set forth and defined in section 1(b) ofthe Order. Compliance costs were estimated using data from a survey oflaboratories potentially affected by the revised GLP standards and fromdata on pesticides testing demand, and costs taken from a 1980 study ofthe pesticides testing industry. This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview as required by Executive Order 12291. Any comments from OMB to EPAand any EPA response to those comments are available for public inspectionat Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and at the Office of Management andBudget, Washington, DC 20503, with OMB requests marked ``Attention: DeskOfficer for EPA.'' B. Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980(Pub. L. 96-354; 94 Stat. 1165 (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.)), and it has beendetermined that it will not have significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small businesses, small governments, or small organization. Itwas found that the GLP revisions will not increase the costs of healtheffects testing and that nonhealth effects testing costs will increaseabout 20 percent. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this rule will be submittedfor approval to OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 etseq. These requirements are not effective until OMB approves them and atechnical amendment to that effect is published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Public reporting for this collection of information is estimated to average15 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searchingexisting data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding theburden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information PolicyBranch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St. SW.
