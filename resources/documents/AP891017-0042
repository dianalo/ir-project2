Robert Wallach tosix years in prison, saying the close associate of former AttorneyGeneral Edwin Meese III sold his influence on the White House backstairs in the Wedtech scandal.   U.S. District Judge Richard Owen also fined Wallach $250,000 andordered him to forfeit $425,000 in illegal payoffs he got fromWedtech Corp. to influence Meese and other government officials tohelp the South Bronx defense contractor win government contracts.   ``Too much success can bring failure. I am the epitome of thatand I am paying for it,'' Wallach, who has known Meese since theyattended law school together, told Owen during Monday's sentencing.   A jury convicted Wallach, 55 of San Francisco, on Aug. 8 ofracketeering, two fraud charges and conspiracy to defraud the U.S.government for his dealings with the now-defunct Wedtech.   ``The litany of these things, I am sickened to talk aboutthem,'' the judge told Wallach. He scolded Wallach for selling``your influence on the back stairs of the White House.''   Owen also gave prison sentences and stiff fines to Wallach's twoco-defendants, former Meese financial adviser W. Franklyn Chinn andChinn's business associate R. Kent London.   Owen sentenced Chinn, 47, of San Francisco, to three years inprison and fined him $100,000, and sentenced London, 46, ofHonolulu, to five years in prison and fined him $250,000. The judgealso ordered Chinn and London to forfeit a $1.14 million consultingfee they received from Wedtech.   Chinn and London were convicted of racketeering, racketeeringconspiracy and fraud charges stemming from payments Wedtech gavethem.   Wallach, who would be eligible for parole after serving twoyears in prison, was free pending appeal. Lawyers for Chinn andLondon also indicated they would appeal.   Evidence at Wallach's and other Wedtech trials showed that theone-time small machine shop grew into a multimillion-dollarmilitary contractor through various bribe schemes.   Wedtech, which collapsed in 1986, was awarded more than $250million in no-bid contracts in four years. It became the target offive state and federal criminal investigations.   Four former Wedtech executives pleaded guilty to bribe- andtheft-related charges in January 1987 and have testified at severaltrials, including a case that resulted in the conviction of Rep.Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., on racketeering. As Owen held his sentencinghearing, another jury in the same courthouse was deliberating in aWedtech case in which Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., and his wife arecharged with conspiracy, extortion and bribery.   Wallach's lawyer, Gary Naftalis, urged the judge to sentence hisclient to community service. He said Wallach had devoted his lifeto helping various causes and was an excellent father.   Wallach, hired by Wedtech as a consultant, was found to havedefrauded the company and its shareholders of $125,000 in 1983. Hebilled that as work for the company's public stock offering, but itactually was for his efforts to influence Meese and others onbehalf of the company.   He also was convicted of illegally receiving $300,000 fromWedtech officials, purportedly for helping the company acquireshipyards and a Michigan tug-barge system. The jury found the moneywas actually a payment in anticipation of Wallach's employment atthe Justice Department, where he could influence Meese and otherofficials. Wallach never received a job at the Justice Department.   Meese, who has not been charged in the Wedtech case, wasPresident Reagan's counsel before becoming U.S. attorney general.He resigned as attorney general in July 1988, and an internalJustice Department report later faulted him for his efforts to helpWallach.</TEXT></DOC>
