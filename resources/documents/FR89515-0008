Section 104(a) of the Veterans'Health Care Amendments of 1983, added 38 U.S.C. 630 to authorize VA toestablish standards for VA approval of community residential care facilities,including health and safety criteria and criteria for the establishmentof reasonable charges for care; clarify eligibility for the program; and,establish due process standards to govern any situation in which a facilityfails to meet the standards and VA wishes to assist veterans in leavingthe facility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>June 14, 1989.The incorporation by reference of a certain publication is approved bythe Director of the Federal Register as of June 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>James R. Kelly, Deputy Director,Patient Treatment Service (181), Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care,Veterans Health Services and Research Administration, 810 Vermont AvenueNW., Washington, DC 20420, (202) 233-3692.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Comments from 14 organizations or individualswere received concerning the proposed regulatory changes published on pages9778-9781 of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 25, 1988 (53 FR 9778).Two commenters stated that the promulgation of these regulations wouldhave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesand would have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more.The commenters based their opinions on three standards: andSection; 17.51j(a)(2),the use of the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) Life SafetyCode; andSection; 17.51j(c)(3), the standard for toilet and bathing facilities;and andSection; 17.51j(e)(2), the standard for square feet in resident'sbedrooms. VA does not agree with these comments for the following reasons.Section 17.51j(a)(2) Implementation of the Life Safety Code will not present an economic hardshipfor community residential care facilities. All VA medical centers havebeen responsible for evaluating community residential care facilities forcompliance with the Life Safety Code for many years, Previous editionsof the Life Safety Code (1967, 1970, 1973, 1976, 1981) have been used.Beginning in 1985, the Life Safety Code has had a chapter which specificallyaddresses community residential care facilities. In previous editions,these facilities were evaluated under other residential type occupancies.The Life Safety Code for Board and Care is the consensus standard and specificallydesigned for community resident care facilities. This chapter was developed by experts in the field including State firemarshals, facility providers and mental health professionals. The LifeSafety Code is also a nationwide standard that assures a uniform levelof safety for all individuals, including veterans, referred to communityresidential care facilities. It has been VA's experience since 1985 thatmost community residential care facilities used by VA meet the Life SafetyCode. Those facilities that do not meet the Life Safety Code have beenfound to be marginally out of compliance. VA's experience, in providingtechnical assistance to those facilities which do not meet the code, hasbeen that compliance can be reached and the level of safety upgraded fora minimal cost. One other commenter also expressed concern about using the Life SafetyCode as the standard because the State had not adopted the Code. If a Statehas a safety code which does not coincide with the NFPA's Life Safety Code,VA can use the Fire Safety Evaluation System (FSES) to determine if thefacility provides an equivalent level of safety. Six other commenters statedthat VA should use the ``most current edition'' of the Code rather thanciting a specific edition. While it has been long-standing VA practiceto use the most current edition of the Life Safety Code, the rules governingpublication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>require that each new edition of the Code beincorporated by reference. This final regulation incorporates the 1988edition of the Life Safety Code. Section 17.51j(c)(3) and andSection; 17.51j(e)(3) In the case of the standards for toilet and bathing facilities and forbedroom size, VA finds that these standards are minimal and are withinthe range of standards that have been implemented by States. In additionto the two commenters mentioned earlier, two other commenters expressedconcern over the toilet/bathing standard and four other commenters expressedconcern over the bedroom size standard. The VA program which most closelyresembles the Community Residential Care Program is the Domiciliary CareProgram. The bedroom standard for a domiciliary is 206 square feet fora two-bed room. The VA standard for community residential care facilitiesis 160 square feet for a two-bed room. While VA considers these standardsto be minimal, it recognizes that some facilities which may meet all otherstandards and provide quality care may be unreasonably penalized by thesestandards. Therefore, VA has introduced a new regulation, andSection; 17.51k, Exceptionsto standards in community residential care facilities. This regulationallows the VA approving official to continue to approve a previously approvedfacility if the facility meets all other standards and also meets a slightlylower standard for andSection; 17.51j(c)(3) and andSection; 17.51j(e)(2). Inaddition, community residential care facilities which do not meet thisrevised standard for approved facilities may apply in writing to the Secretaryof Veterans Affairs for an exception, andSection; 17.51k(b). VA finds thatthis change should resolve the concerns expressed by the commenters inthese areas. The changes clearly lessen any economic impact on currentlyapproved community residential care facilities. With these changes, VA finds that the regulation will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities and will nothave an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. One commenter suggested that andSection; 17.51h, Eligibility, be expandedto include a special outpatient eligibility status because of a veteran'sreferral to a community residential care facility. VA finds that this suggestionis not envisioned by Section 104(a) of Pub. L. 98-160, Veterans' HealthCare Amendment of 1983, and that eligibility for outpatient care is governedby 38 U.S.C. 612. Two commenters suggested changes to andSection; 17.51j(a)(1), Health andsafety standards. One commenter suggested that compliance with State andlocal regulations should be tied to State licensure of a community residentialcare facility. VA agree with this comment and has modified this sectionaccordingly. Another commenter suggested that in addition to State andlocal regulations that VA require community residential care facilitiesto meet Federal Environmental Protection Agency regulations. VA finds thatState regulations are sufficient in these areas for the purpose of theseregulations. One commenter stated that andSection; 17.51j(b), Health services, would requirethe facility operator to provide services, e.g., administration of medications,which might be prohibited by State law. Section 17.51j(b) has been modifiedto respond to this concern. Nine commenters stated concerns about andSection; 17.51j(h), Residents rights,specifically, andSection; 17.51j(h)(2), Financial affairs, and andSection;17.51j(h)(5), Freedom of association. VA has adopted changes to andSection;17.51j(h)(2) to restrict the right of a resident who has been rated incompetentto manage personal financial matters. VA has not made any changes to andSection; 17.51j(h)(5) as the Departmentdoes not find that it can arbitrarily abridge the right of a resident tofreely associate. At the same time, VA recognizes that some residents mightchoose to associate with individuals who could cause disruption at thefacility or that some residents might display behaviors which could beharmful to themselves or others. VA finds that andSection; 17.51j(h) doesnot in any way conflict with the establishment and enforcement of facilityrules regarding these issues. Two commenters remarked on andSection;17.51j(i), Records. One commenter suggestedthat the recordkeeping requirement was burdensome for small facilities,while another commenter suggested that the standard require more comprehensiverecords. VA finds that the recordkeeping standard is minimal, and requiresthat only essential documents be kept. Two commenters stated that the wording of andSection; 17.51j(j), Staff requirements,was vague. VA finds merit in this concern; however, as credentialing standardshave not been established by the industry, VA is unable to be more specificin this requirement. Two commenters expressed the concern that andSection; 17.51j(k), Cost ofcommunity residential care, established too low a base price, with thebase established at July 1987 prices with annual increases not to exceedthe national Consumer Price Index. Specifically, the commenters were concernedabout cost increases associated with any necessary facility renovationsto meet VA standards. VA finds that andSection;17.51j(k)(3)(iii) allows fordeviations from the price increases and adequately addresses the concernsof these commentators. Two commenters stated that andSection; 17.511, Duration of approval, wastoo complex and suggested a simpler standard. The Administration is committedto testing this new approach to inspections. The Administration believesthat the incentive of less frequent inspections may encourage greater compliancewith standards on the part of community residential care facilities. One commenter stated that andSection; 17.51m, Notice of noncompliance withVA standards, was too burdensome and dangerous in allowing the facilitya 36 hour response time to the notice of noncompliance in a life-threateningsituation, andSection; 17.51m(4). VA recognizes the need to balance the healthand safety of referred veterans in community residential care facilitiesand the right of due process for the facility. VA finds that State andlocal agencies have authority to intervene in emergency situations thatcan assist the residents in a facility. The information collection in andSection; 17.51j(i) has been cleared by theOffice of Management and Budget, control number 2900-0491. It has publicreporting burden estimated to average seven minutes per response, includingthe time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. If you have comments regarding this burden estimate orany other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestionsfor reducing this burden, send them to the VA Clearing Officer (732), Departmentof Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington DC, 20420, andto the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (2900-0491),Washington, DC 20503. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs certifies that the final regulationswill not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.601 612. The final regulations reflect standards which have, for the mostpart, been informally utilized for many years and do not create new expectationsfor the facility operators which would have a significant economic impact.The Secretary has determined that these final regulations are considerednon-major under the criteria of Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation.The regulations will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 millionor more; they will not result in major increases in costs for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, orgeographic regions; nor will they have significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofthe United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets. We appreciate the comments and suggestions of those who responded to publicationof the proposed regulations. The proposed rules are, hereby, adopted withthe amendments noted above and minor amendments of a technical nature.The final rules are set forth below. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 17</ITAG>Alcoholism, Claims, Dental health, Drug abuse, Foreign relations, Governmentcontracts, Grants programs-health, Health care, Health facilities, Healthprofessions, Incorporation by reference, Medical devices, Medical research,Mental health programs, Nursing homes, Philippines, Veterans.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: April 4, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.
