<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-05-0687 </DOCNO><TEXT>A medium (K) developed for culturing fastidious oceanic phytoplanktonhas been tested using recently isolated ultraphytoplankton clones representingat least seven different algal classes. The medium was designed to satisfyas completely as possible the nutritional requirements of this diversegroup of phytoplankters. Important aspects are the addition of selenium,the inclusion of both nitrate and ammonium, an increased level of chelationand a moderate level of pH buffering. The sea water-based version ofthis medium has been tested on 200 clones of which 186 grew reliably.A synthetic counterpart (AK) was tested on 40 of the more difficult clonesand 27 grew well; 13 grew not at all. While neither medium meets theexacting nutritional needs of all the ultraphytoplankton forms tested,they are excellent for most oceanic clones and are very successful forthe isolation and establishment in culture of new oceanic phytoplanktonclones.</TEXT></DOC>
