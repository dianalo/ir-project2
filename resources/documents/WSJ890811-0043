The transactions will cost the Resolution Trust Corp., the new government agency established to sell or merge the nation's ailing Sandamp;Ls, only $175 million. That's just a drop in a flood of $50 billion the agency will spend over the next two years.    Under the deals announced last night, deposits of the sick thrifts will be transferred to new institutions, which include two banks and a savings bank. The acquiring institutions will pay a premium for the right to receive the deposits, and they will have the option of purchasing loans and other assets of the failed Sandamp;Ls. The deposits they acquire will be backed by equivalent cash payments from the agency.    In one transaction, Comerica Bank Texas of Dallas is likely to convert the thrift it is acquiring, Park Cities Savings Association of Dallas, to a bank branch. The new law allows banks to make such conversions.    Agency officials hope that by giving purchasers of sick Sandamp;Ls such options, the new law will make the institutions more attractive to buyers and thus will draw new capital to the thrift industry. For example, banks easily could expand their branch systems and realize economies of scale by buying Sandamp;Ls and converting them to bank branches.    &quot;It helps to become the low-cost producer in the market,&quot; said J. Michael Fulton, senior vice president, corporate development, of Comerica.    Those who acquire the Sandamp;Ls won't be required to honor rates the institutions have been paying on certificates of deposit. Instead, after two weeks, they will be authorized to reduce those rates to what they are paying on passbook accounts, according to a spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. However, CD holders will be allowed to withdraw funds early without paying a penalty.    In the past, bank or thrift regulators rarely gave acquiring institutions the option to repudiate the CD rates paid by insolvent thrifts, even though such rates often were much higher than prevaili ng market rates. Last year, such repudiation was permitted in just 30 of the 200 transactions in which failed banks were sold. &quot;It's important to emphasize in the bank area, most haven't been handled like this,&quot; a spokesman for the FDIC said. Resolution Trust operates as an arm of the FDIC.    Comerica took over deposits totaling $39.7 million from Park Cities Savings, and is paying $20,000 for the right to receive the transferred deposits. Park Cities held assets with a book value of $48.1 million.    In another transaction, $90.1 million in deposits of Liberty Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, New Port Richey, Fla., were transferred to the Citizens andamp; Southern National Bank of Florida, Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Citizens andamp; Southern is paying Resolution Trust $1.1 million for the right to receive the transferred deposits. Liberty Federal held $56.5 million in assets.    Resolution Trust transferred $46.5 million in deposits of First Savings of America, Orland Park, Ill., with assets totaling $21.3 million, to St. Paul Federal Bank for Savings of Chicago.    The offices of all the failed thrifts will open today under the names of the buyers.    Regulators said they will continue with such fairly simple transactions until they become more accustomed to closing sick thrifts under the new law. &quot;It will be a learning process,&quot; said Roger Watson, head of planning for the FDIC. &quot;We will start reasonably slow and be more careful in early transactions to perceive what the market expects and what the trade-offs are.&quot;    Once Resolution Trust gets its footing, he said, institutions with the greatest operating losses will be given a high priority to be merged, sold or liquidated. </TEXT></DOC>
