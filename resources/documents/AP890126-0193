(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Scottish immigrant who became adecorated Vietnam soldier and then a troubled veteran with a stringof arrests told a deportation judge Thursday that he can't explain``the crazy stuff'' he's done.   Hearings ended Thursday on whether Fred S. Jackson, 40, aresident alien in this country for more than 20 years, should bedeported. Immigration Judge Billino W. D'Ambrosio said he would ruleon the case within 60 days.   Jackson, facing deportation because of 26 felony convictionssince he got out of the Army in 1970, is arguing that he should beallowed to stay in the United States because of his military record.   Resident aliens who have been convicted of at least two crimesinvolving ``moral turpitude'' are subject to deportation.   He blames his crimes on the post-traumatic stress syndrome, acondition found in some Vietnam veterans and victims of violentcrimes.   Jackson says flashbacks of terrifying ambushes and firefights ledhim to abuse drugs and alcohol.   During the hearing Thursday, Sean Keenan, a U.S. Immigration andNaturalization Service attorney, questioned Jackson about hiscriminal record, especially the six convictions since deportationproceedings began in 1978. Jackson conceded that those offensesmight strengthen the case against him.   ``I can't explain any of the crazy stuff I've done,'' saidJackson, who was seriously wounded twice in Vietnam and awarded twoPurple Hearts and the Bronze star.   ``If I knew what I was doing, I wouldn't have done it,'' he said.   Immigration officials have continually refused to discuss thecase in detail or their reasoning for seeking deportation, sayinglaws prevent them from doing so.   Jackson was treated at the post-traumatic stress unit at theVeterans Administration Medical Center in Northampton, Mass., lastsummer. He said he hasn't used drugs or alcohol in more than sixmonths.   The immigration service began deportation proceedings againstJackson in 1978 after a string of convictions for burglary, larcenyand drug possession.   In 1980, Jackson was convicted of armed robbery charges inFlorida. The government renewed efforts to deport Jackson after hisrelease from prison in 1985.   Jackson's legal representative, Robert D. Money of theInternational Institute, said his recent problems, including anarrest for drunken driving in April 1988, don't necessarily ruin hischances to remain in the United States.   ``It isn't a serious blow, because in Fred's case, he has anillness,'' Money said. ``He's going all-out to cooperate with thedoctors.''   Jackson, who retains a slight Scottish brogue, enlisted in 1967at age 18, two years after his family emigrated to Norwich, anindustrial city about 30 miles southwest of Hartford. He went toVietnam in January 1968 as an infantryman with the 1st Air CavalryDivision.   He now lives in public housing in Norwich with his wife,Charlene, her 6-year-old son and their infant daughter. The familylives on disability payments from the Army, and from SocialSecurity, which has declared him 100 percent disabled.</TEXT></DOC>
