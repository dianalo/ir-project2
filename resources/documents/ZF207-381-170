Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Court Backs GSA's Denial of MCI ProtestandM;A federal court has affirmed the General Services Administration Board ofContract Appeals decision rejecting MCI Telecommunications Corp.'s protest ofthe FTS 2000 procurement.andM;The ruling by the U.S.andP;  Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit inWashington agreed with GSBCA that MCI was not an interested party in theprocurement and could not protest the choice of ATandamp;T Co. to provide 60percent of the FTS 2000 long-distance communications service to governmentagencies.andM;MCI said in its protest is expected to bid as a prime contractor if the GSAaward to ATandamp;T was overturned and the procurement recompeted.andP;  But because MCI&quot;did not itself submit its own proposal at any time during the proposalperiod,&quot; it had no standing to protest, the court ruled.andM;MCI was a subcontractor to prime Martin Marietta Corp. in the bidding for themultibillion-dollar contract to upgrade the government's long-distancetelecommunications network with a digital system capable of carrying voice,data, image and video traffic.andP;  US Spring Communications Co., the othersuccessful bidder, received 40 percent of the FTS 2000 contract.andM;Although Martin Marietta filed an administrative protest with GSA after itfailed to win part of the FTS business, Martin Marietta did not join MCI inthe GSBCA protest.andM;The majority of the GSBCA administrative law judges held that MCI had nostanding, but Chief Judge Leonard J. Suchanek filed a dissenting opinion,arguing that the panel should have examined MCI's status as an offerer orpotential offerer.andP;  He wrote that the company could be a &quot;de facto offerer.&quot;andM;The appeals court's ruling appeared to leave little room for argument thatMCI was an interested party.andP;  The decision said: &quot;The opportunity to qualityeither as an actual or a prospective bidder ends when the proposal periodends.andM;&quot;By the close of the proposal period, MCI had placed itself outside theboundaries of interested party status.andP;  That is where it must remain unless,owing to the acts of an interested party which actually submitted a proposalor filed a timely protest, a resolicitation results.&quot;andM;Also on the FTS 200 front, Virginia Gov.andP;  Gerald L. Baliles last weekdedicated the US Sprint center from which GSA will monitor FTS 2000 servicesto about 550,000 federal employees.andM;Already 40 of the nearly 100 GSA employees who will work there have movedinto the service oversight center in Herdon, Va.andP;  Joseph Seanor, who has beenin charge of quality assurance for the existing FTS, heads the team.andM;US Sprint officials said the location of the service oversight centerdirectly across from the company's network control center on the fourth floorof the building is symbolic of the &quot;partnership&quot; the multibilliontelecommunications contract has fostered between US Sprint and GSA.andM;&quot;The GSA's oversight center is adjacent to, and a mirror image of, ournetwork control center,&quot; said David Gergacz, chief operating officer of USSprint's Network Systems Division.andM;ATandamp;T Co., the other FTS 2000 services supplier, dedicated a similar centerearlier.andP;  An ATandamp;T spokeswoman said all 135 GSA employees who will staff thatcenter are expected to move in by the end of the month.andM;The cutover from the current analog service to the FTS 2000 network isscheduled to start Oct. 8, when the two contractors begin supplying switchedvoice service to nearly 50 federal locations.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
