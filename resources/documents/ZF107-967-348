 Sosays a new report on fourth generation languages, written by research teamMartin Butler and Robin Bloor, which appropriately takes an end of the decadelook at a market sector that seems to have promised a lot more than itdelivered.andP;  From the early 1980s on, unfortunate Cobol developers werebombarded with sales and marketing pitches telling them that they wereshortly to become redundant, replaced by technical users (not necessarilyprogrammers at all) wielding tools that could produce complex applications at10 times the speed, with the added benefits of portability and flexibilitythrown in.andP;  In theory, most commercial software authors should have abandonedtraditional languages altogether by now.andP;  In practice, it is estimated thatCobol is still used for over 40% of the current systems produced in the US,while use of the C language, spurred on by its advantages of portability andclose ties with Unix, has boomed.andP;  What went wrong, and what is now right?andM;Often fall downandM;The report - 4GLs: an Evaluation and Comparison, published by ButlerBloor Ltd- identifies a number of crucial factors essential to the success of a fourthgeneration language that were not widely recognised initially.andP;  The commonfactor that tied the 22 fourth generation language products studied in thereport turned out to be the their use of a data dictionary, holding fields,database tables, forms, and occasionally procedures.andP;  Such languages aresimply a front-end for exploiting the information in that dictionary, andcode should be developed with this in mind.andP;  It is better, says the report,to think in terms of a fourth generation environment, consisting ofdictionary, forms management package, query language, report writer andconventional third generation language, which encourages more effort on theoriginal analysis and design stages, things many 4GL vendors have led us tobelieve are no longer necessary.andP;  The new languages impress when generatingroutines of commonly-used functions - such as a simple file maintenancetransaction - but often fall down when a non-standard task is required.andP;  Onecase study in the report tells of a user spending two weeks &quot;bending&quot; aproduct to produce a bar code routine that would have taken one hour in aconventional language.andP;  One aspect of 4GLs that did become rapidly evidentwas that functionality in 4GLs was nearly always gained at the expense ofperformance.andP;  Early 4GL-produced software was often notoriously slow andmemory hungry.andP;  Not only that, but the advantages of elements adaptable bythe end user often led to the production of over complex reporting tasks thatcould take up vast amounts of CPU time.andP;  The quest for ease of use led manyof the early 4GLs to opt for a non-procedural approach to their languages,leading to an inflexibility that has been avoided by the newer, procedural4GLs.andP;  And one area that is still rarely addressed in 4GLs is a gooddebugging facility - surprising since a recent survey by Ready Systems Increvealed that software maintenance can account for 67% of the total projectcost, with testing at 15%, requirements, analysis and design 11%, codingitself a mere 7%.andM;By John AbbottandM;Despite all this, the 4GL market is very healthy, with estimates of a $3,000mbusiness for databases and their associated languages during 1990.andP;  Theproducts themselves have developed from the earliest versions, and newgeneration hardware is now more capable of coping with the extra overheadsthey demand.andP;  As the report points out, most of the major independentsoftware houses - Computer Associates, Oracle, Ashton-Tate, Ingres, CincomSystems, Software AG, Cognos and Information Builders - are all offeringfourth generation languages, and there are promising products from smaller,but significant companies such as Sybase, Unify, and the Netherlands-basedcompany Uniface.andP;  Around 40 products on the market are available on DEC VAX,and 30 or so run under Unix.andP;  Very few are now specific to a singlemanufacturer's hardware.andP;  The report covers 22 products including theVAX-specific Systel and IBM-specific Synon/2.andP;  The other 20 are all availableon Unix, aside from Software AG's Natural product and Computer AssociatesCA-DB:Gen, which will both be available in Unix versions &quot;soon&quot;.andP;  The reportdivides product assessment into six categories: development environment,performance, architecture and scope, inter-operability, end userfunctionality and portability.andP;  Overall, the best ratings are achieved byComputer Associates and Software AG, which both score top marks onperformance and architecture and scope.andP;  CA-DB from Computer Associates is infact the software it acquired from its takeover of Cullinet Software lastyear, and is not strictly a fourth generation language at all, but anapplications generator producing third generation code with embedded SQL,resulting in high performance, and &quot;open&quot; Fortran, Cobol or C code notconstrained to either a proprietary database or fourth generation language.andO;Problems arise with maintenance, as there is currently no means of reverseengineering the 3GL code produced back to the 4GL.andP;  The other productssingled out by the report include Accell from Unify, and Uniface, which isalso bundled in Europe with the Sybase database as Fastbuild.andP;  These productsgain top marks for the development environment, with the Uniface productmaking extensive use of a powerful data dictionary, with good formsmanagement and full database-independence.andP;  Those not faring so well includeToday (now owned by Australian giant Computer Power Group), which iscriticised for its largely non- procedural approach, and the older languagessuch as Microprocessor Development Group's Sculptor (hard to interface with3GLs) and the UK National Computer Centre's Filetab.andP;  Others covered in thereport include Focus, Informix, Ingres, Mimer, Oracle, Powerhouse, Pro IV,Progress and SAS.andM;ExplosionandM;The 4GL explosion is only just beginning.andP;  The widespread use of SQL meansthat database prices will begin to fall, and vendors must find a way ofdifferentiating their products from their competitors.andP;  Of the trends in the4GL market, the most important is database-independence, identified astutelyby Unify Corp, which recently unbundled its Accell set of tools from its owndatabase, and even persuaded its deadly rival Oracle to market them.andP;  Takinginter-operability further, it is likely that some vendors will release&quot;reverse engineering products&quot; that will allow users to switch from one 4GLto another if they wish, thus breaking the language lock-in.andP;  This hasalready been done with 3GLs such as Cobol, and should be far easier with 4GLproducts.andP;  Object-oriented functionality will become increasingly important,with closer ties between fourth and third generation-class libraries.andP;  Andsays the report, the move in hardware to client-server configurations willlargely address the performance limitations, particularly associated withfunctions such as scrolled areas, windowing and the use of high levelconstructs - clientserver hardware architectures being &quot;the ideal hardwareset-up for 4GL systems&quot;.andP;  Perhaps the days of Cobol really are numbered afterall.andP;  4GLs: an Evaluation and Comparison is available from ButlerBloor Ltd ofHull, UK at #380.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
