Wilson, director of the Park Ridge, N.J., company's OpticalStorage Technology Group.andM;Users also may want a subset of data available to work on outside of theoffice, which means adding a 5-1/4-inch rewritable system, Wilson said in aninterview with GCN.andM;If 5-1/4-inch rewritable technology was used on an engineering workstation ora large network, users might find that a great deal of data is being shippedacross the network, Wilson said.andM;Associated data storage requirements could overwhelm the network, so userswould add 12-inch WORM drives.andM;Several agencies have mass storage requirements in the 1,000-gigabyte range,but existing optical-storage systems cannot solve such problems, Wilson said.andO;Sony is finding an optical-market niche, &quot;but maybe we'll take that base andexpand it,&quot; he said.andM;Keeping government users satisfied is important to Sony because 60 percent to70 percent of Sony's optical-technology business is from government users,Wilson said.andM;Roll Out the PlanandM;Agencies are beginning to install full-fledged systems with a mandatoryquantity and roll out plan included in the procurement, Wilson said.andM;Agencies then have the ability to stop the project after the mandatoryquantity has been delivered, if the agency finds the technology no longermeets new requirements.andM;&quot;We are now seeing multiple-site projects, which by nature are notprototypes,&quot; Wilson said.andP;  &quot;The National Archives system is a grandioseprototype system.andP;  They will find out how effective the system is and expandit at that one location.&quot;andM;Magneto-optical rewritable disk drives do have &quot;enormous potential,&quot; but agreat deal of work has to be done before image systems really take off, saidJay Bretzman, the senior analyst for peripheral storage at International DataCorp., Framingham, Mass.andM;The first generation of the drives has performed slowly and has been veryexpensive, Bretzman said.andP;  &quot;Efforts have been directed at reliability, nothigh performance,&quot; he said.andM;The second generation of drives, which could be available as soon as 1991,will be able to store about 2 gigabytes on each disk side, and both sides maybe on line at the same time, Bretzman said.andM;Other improvements will include an adherence to standards, disks that spinfaster and a higher sustained throughput, Bretzman said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
