Rate constants for the reaction of CO withV(CO){sub 3}, V(CO){sub 4}, and V(CO){sub 5} are found as (0.4 +/- 0.1)x 10{sup -10}, (0.5 +/- 0.1) x 10{sup -10}, and (0.5 +/- 0.1) x 10{sup-10} cm{sup 3} molecule{sup -1} s{sup -1}, respectively, leading to theexpectation that ground-state V(CO)/sub 3-5/ share the doublet characterof V(CO){sub 6}. The infrared assignments are in disagreement with infraredabsorption and some ESR studies of V(CO)/sub x/ fragments in low-temperaturematrices.</TEXT></DOC>
