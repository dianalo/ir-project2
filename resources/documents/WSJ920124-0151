In&quot;Fugitive Nights&quot; (Perigord Press/Morrow, 336 pages, $22),comedy all but gains the upper hand.   The chief buffoon here is Lynn Cutter, a fortysomethingPalm Springs police detective with bad knees, a bulging gutand a massive craving for alcohol. Counting the days until hecan retire from the force with a disability pension, Cutterspends his nights in a series of mansions he house-sits forabsent rich folk. His drinking hours are racked up at TheFurnace Room, a bar and grill patronized by aging show-biztypes.</LP><TEXT>   The book's second banana is 5-foot-7 Nelson Hareem, ayoung eager-beaver police officer given to throwingchoke-holds first and checking ID later. Nicknamed &quot;DirtyHareem,&quot; Nelson is paying for past mistakes by working thewrong end of the sweltering Coachella Valley, even as heschemes for a transfer to the more glamorous Springs.   Bringing the two men together in roundabout fashion isBreda Burrows, former LAPD officer and neophyte Palm Springsprivate investigator. When she needs a police contact toassist with a lucrative domestic surveillance case, Burrowspersuades Cutter to moonlight. When the man they're watchingis seen meeting a much-wanted fugitive illegal alien, Hareemjoins their team.   Mr. Wambaugh uses a pretty thick brush in painting thisdesert scene. His novel's main figures often seem likecartoon characters as they careen through the Springs inpursuit of a quarry who may or may not be a drug smuggler, aterrorist or a hired gun. Still, &quot;Fugitive Nights&quot; has itssubtler passages, some genuine suspense, a few surprisingplot twists and a generous helping of pop sociology. So theresult is a flawed but often satisfying entry in the Wambaughoeuvre.   Lawrence Sanders is another suspense writer known to mixchuckles with thrills. His latest, &quot;McNally's Secret&quot;(Putnam, 317 pages, $21.95), also has more gags than gore.The McNally narrating this tale is Archibald, or Archy --half of a Palm Beach firm called McNally andamp; Son. PrescottMcNally is the oh-so-proper father and lawyer, cateringdiscreetly to Florida's Gold Coast upper crust. Archy is thesuave legman who does the dirty work.   Dad assigns son to investigate the apparent theft of fourhighly valuable stamps from the estate of wealthy matronCynthia Horowitz. Among the suspects: two needy offspring,some shady servants and a sharp-tongued house guest. Thestakes are raised with the killing of a philately expertconsulted by Archy.   In a subplot to his sleuthing, Archy conducts a torridaffair with a beautiful antiques dealer named JenniferTowley. Heretofore happy as a philanderer, Archy seemsseriously smitten with his new flame. But Towley stillcarries a torch for her former husband, an ex-convict andcompulsive gambler who swears he's reformed. Will Archyforsake all other &quot;jolly ladies&quot; for a serious relationshipwith Jenny? The suspense is bearable.   Mr. Sanders is a skillful craftsman, and often his bookshave an authenticity and grittiness that raise them above thecategory of fluff entertainment. &quot;McNally's Secret,&quot; though,is one airy souffle.   There is little that is meant to be light in Robin Cook'slatest medico-thriller, &quot;Blindsight&quot; (Putnam, 429 pages,$21.95). That is not to say its melodramatics do not come offas laughable. Laurie Montgomery, a first-year associate atthe Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for the City of NewYork, is the novel's leading character and an amateur sleuth.Dr. Montgomery's attention is drawn to a series ofdrug-related deaths among Manhattan's yuppie set. All of thevictims have overdosed on cocaine, but none seem to have ahistory of drug abuse. Prodded by guilty memories of her ownbrother's fatal overdose, Laurie probes for clues among theaccumulating corpses.   At the same time, NYPD Detective Lieutenant Lou Soldanoseeks Montgomery's expertise in investigating a rash ofexecution-style killings. Few of these victims seem to havebeen tied to organized crime, but all have been shot inmobster fashion. Lt. Soldano's inquiries lead him to JordanScheffield, a flamboyant ophthalmologist whose VIP clientsinclude a crime-family boss. This same Dr. Scheffield iscurrently waging a whirlwind romantic assault on LaurieMontgomery.   Coincidence plays a large part in Dr. Cook's new fiction,which is long on medical detail, medium on suspense and shorton plausible behavior. Laurie, still in her job'sprobationary period, persists in disobeying and antagonizingher boss. Having been duped once by a tabloid reporter,Laurie trusts the same scrivener to protect her interestswhen she hands him an explosive scoop. During her frequentconferences with Lou, Laurie neglects to mention informationvital to his investigation and to her own safety.   The heroine's not the only one made to act inconsistentlyin order to keep the plot grinding. A pair of hitmen, atfirst chillingly expert, eventually bumble around like alethal Laurel and Hardy. Lt. Soldano abandons policeprocedure and common sense in rushing to an attempted rescue.   Well, it's not &quot;blindsight&quot; that's supposed to be 20-20.</TEXT></DOC>
