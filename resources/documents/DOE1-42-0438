The soluble Cd contents in the soils with added CdS broughtabout the large differences in proportion to variation of Eh in comparisonwith other Cd compounds, and it was suggested that the phenomena approximatelyagreed with the movements of Cd in the soils polluted by Cd. 2. CdS dissolvedlittle in water and the diluted acids. But, it was recognized that thesoluble Cd contents of CdS increased greatly under the condition addedFe{sup 3+}. The soluble Cd contents in soils with added CdS differedgreatly among soil groups. As the reason, Fe{sup 3+} contents in thesoils affected primarily Cd dissolution, were recognized. A part of Fe{sup3+} contents in the soil solutions extracted by 0.1 N HCl under the conditionbefore CdS was added, varied Fe{sup 2+} after CdS were added. And alsothe more the soluble Cd contents in the soils increased, the more theFe{sup 2+} contents increased. In brief, the variations of the solubleCd contents by oxidation and reduction were primarily caused by Fe{sup3+} + e reversible Fe{sup 2+} reaction in the paddy soils polluted byCd, and it was suggested that a series of the reactions affected greatlyin the Cd absorption of the rice plant.</TEXT></DOC>
