 And it was giving astanding ovation to the man--for barely winning.andM;Just 43 seconds remained on Karpov's clock when Deep Thought resigned.andM;People have long accepted the superiority of machines at routine tasks suchas stamping out Ford Taurus fenders or searching through pages of storedinformation.andP;  At the same time, chess-playing computers have evolved fromlaughable 1950s experiments into serious rivals to the world's grand masters.andO;But the prospect of machines defeating the finest players in thisquint-essential test of human ingenuity and determination?andP;  Beating the best?andO;Inconceivable.andM;Karpov, 39, had been favored--both statistically and sentimentally--to winhis February 2 contest against Deep Thought, played on the Harvard campus, inCambridge, Massachusetts.andP;  Karpov's number-two world ranking means that onlyone person on earth, world champ Gari Kasparov, is expected to beat him atthe game.andP;  For anyone else, a contest against Karpov, winner of a record 77global competitions, is a defeat waiting to happen.andM;Champion Kasparov had already taken a turn against Deep Thought.andP;  He'dwhipped the computer in an exhibition match four months earlier.andP;  After thatmatch, he professed his broad confidence that chess computers would never beable to beat the best human players.andP;  &quot;Chess is wider than calculation,&quot;Kasparov explained.andP;  &quot;It's even wider than logic.andP;  You have to use fantasyand intuition.&quot;andM;From the beginning, Deep Thought startled the crowd and Karpov by coming onlike a digitized fury.andP;  Debugged since its loss to Kasparov last October, thecomputer played its black pieces forcefully during the game's opening.andP;  AsKarpov strained to keep his non-human rival from turning a slight midgameedge into an insurmountable advantage, the pro-human sentiment grew thick.andM;More troubling to the Russian than the computer's apparent skill was theclock.andP;  Karpov's early deliberations in the timed game had allowed his clockto wind down relentlessly.andP;  When Deep Thought still had 25 minutes left inwhich to make all of its moves, Karpov was down to 5.andP;  If he went over histime limit, Karpov would lose by forfeit.andM;Deep Thought's brain consists of two special-purpose chips, which are mountedon a circuit board measuring slightly larger than a square foot.andP;  Thiscompact engine (a Sun 4 workstation is attached for memory, disk storage, andcommunications) lets Deep Thought analyze more chessboard positions than anyother machine--more than 800,000 positions per second, compared with the100,000 an elevator-size Cray X-MP supercomputer can handle.andM;With a U.S.andP;  Chess Federation rating of 2,552 (a number earned by beatingplayers with lesser ratings), Deep Thought is the highest-rated computer everand ranks among the top 40 chess players, flesh or metal, in the UnitedStates.andP;  A player rated above 2,000 is considered an expert.andP;  Kasparov,arguably the best player ever, is rated at an unprecedented 2,900.andP;  Karpov'srating is 2,850.andM;Deep Thought comes from a long line of chess-playing machines dating to the18th century.andP;  The earliest one were mechanical, humanlike figures thatimpressed theatergoers by reaching out and moving pieces by themselves.andO;These contraptions, with mystical names like Ajeeb and the Turk, playedremarkably well because they were frauds--controlled by diminutive chessexperts hiding inside.andM;Reasonable chess-playing machines weren't feasible until the advent of thecomputer in the 1950s.andP;  Games and computers have always fit together nicely: games give computer programmers the opportunity to explore the capabilitiesof new machines and to test their own programming prowness by working onconfined--but still complex--problems.andM;Chess in particular has always held an abiding attraction to researchers inartificial intelligence, since the game has always been considered anintellectual pursuit par excellence.andP;  Alan Turing, &quot;the father of AI&quot; whosuggested in 1950 that machines could eventually &quot;compete with men in allpurely intellectual pursuits,&quot; tested some of his notions with a chessprogram that he called Turochamp.andM;Adapted to run on the Manchester Automatic Digital Machine (MADAM) whileTuring was posted at England's University of Manchester, Turochamp became&quot;the first machine capable of playing a complete, if very slow games ofchess,&quot; says Pamela McCorduck in her book, Machines Who Think.andP;  By Turing'sadmission, the program was prone to make the same mistakes he himself made asa mediocre chess player.andM;But chess computers have always encountered resistance.andP;  In the late 1950s,for example, chess-playing software specifically written for IBM's new 704computer was &quot;so psychologically threatening&quot; that salespeople feared itmight scare potential users away, McCorduck writes.andP;  &quot;Thus [IBM] made adeliberate move to defuse the potency of such programs by conducting ahard-sell campaign picturing the computer as nothing more than a quickmoron.&quot;andM;Carnegie-Mellon University, the hotbed of AI research where Deep Thought wasdeveloped, has its own tradition of computer chess.andP;  In 1957, notedCarnegie-Mellon AI researchers Alan Newell, Herbert Simon, and J. C. Shawdeveloped chess software and predicted that a computer would become a worldchess champion within ten years.andM;A computer capable of beating any person in chess &quot;would seem to havepenetrated the core of the human intellect,&quot; they wrote.andP;  The best chesscomputer before Deep Thought also came from Carnegie-Mellon.andP;  In 1988,Hitech, developed by computer scientist Hans Berliner, became the firstcomputer to defeat an international grand master.andM;Deep Thought was designed by a team of Carnegie-Mellon graduate students, whostarted work on the project in 1985.andM;Programmer and chess expert Murray Campbell, who had done some work onHitech, developed Deep Thought's ability to evaluate board positions.andP;  ThomasAnantharaman wrote the code for the software running on Deep Thought's hostcomputer.andM;Engineer Feng-Hsiung Hsu engineered Deep Thought's high-speed hardware.andO;&quot;What is my inspiration?&quot; ask Hsu.andP;  &quot;I want to make history.&quot;andM;As usual, Deep Thought didn't show up for the match.andP;  The computer remainedhoused in a laboratory at IBM's research facility in Yorktown Heights, NewYork, transmitting each of its moves by modem to a terminal-emulating PS/2beneath the bridge table on which the match was waged.andM;Seated across the table from Karpov, facing the PS/2's monitor and keyboard,hardware engineer Hsu served as the chess brain's link to the world.andP;  Themoment that Karpov thwacked his clock to end a move, Hsu quickly keyed in thenotation for the move, telling Deep Thought what was happening.andP;  When thecomputer's replies came over the wire, Hsu would slide the pieces on itscommand.andM;Karpov tried to return Deep Thought's tireless detachment with a &quot;poker face&quot;of his own, says Hsu.andP;  But the dark rings under the Soviet's eyes wererevealing.andP;  Karpov had arrived in Cambridge just the day before, after visaproblems in the Soviet Union had forced him to spend 24 straight hours awake.andM;Another human weakness may have played a role in Karpov'sless-than-auspicious beginning: he apparently had taken the machine toolightly.andP;  He'd waited until only the night before to begin reviewing some ofDeep Thought's previous games and tactics, according to Michael Valvo, acomputer-chess expert who often advises Deep Thought's opponents.andM;&quot;He saw how easily Kasparov won,&quot; Campbell surmises.andP;  But Kasparov, despitehis postgame bravado, had spent weeks prior to his match studying as many as50 of the computer's past games.andM;IBM hired Hsu, Campbell, and Anantharaman upon their graduation fromCarnegie-Mellon last fall to continue work on Deep Thought.andP;  The corporationwants them to develop a &quot;massively parallel&quot; system that processes moves athousand times faster than Deep Thought does.andP;  It hopes that the group'sresearch for the project might help with other knotty engineering problems,such as determining the optimal positioning for the thousands of wiredconnections on printed circuit boards.andM;IBM also gains publicity with Deep Thought, through exhibitions such as theKarpov match.andP;  Whether the publicity is positive or negative is open todebate.andP;  At events across America, everyone roots for IBM's adopted prodigyto fail.andP;  Never mind the fact that Deep Thought's creators spent years ofsweat, brainpower, and creativity to capture within wire and silicon theintricacies of a game that has beguiled humankind for thousands of years.andM;Never mind that these creators have come close to achieving a technologicalfeat that has long been considered impossible.andP;  After Kasparov's thrashing ofDeep Thought, one reporter called the event &quot;a triumph of humanity.&quot;andM;&quot;It doesn't bother us much.andP;  We sort of expect it,&quot; says Campbell, now an IBMvisiting scientist.andP;  Those watching a person struggle against a computer, hesays, &quot;see themselves.andP;  They can put themselves in the place of the human.&quot;andO;Somehow, American audiences find it easier to empathize with a Soviet chessgenius than with a team of computer programmers from Pittsburgh.andM;Pride on the line and humanity on his shoulders, Karpov pressed on.andP;  Suddenlyhe caught Deep Thought in a bad move--an amateurishly bad move.andP;  The computerallowed Karpov to create a pair of connected, passed pawns.andP;  With less thanthree minutes left on his clock, Karpov was quick to exploit the error.andP;  Heclicked into overdrive, making his moves in split-second motions.andP;  He pinnedback Deep Thought's king, isolated the computer's rook from the action, andbrought his own king into the fray as an offensive force in conjunction withthe pawns.andM;&quot;When humans have no time, they become like computers,&quot; observed Valvo inpostmatch commentary.andP;  With just 43 seconds left on Karpov's clock, DeepThought resigned, to the relief of the breathless crowd.andP;  Although scheduledto speak after the match as he had so graciously done beforehand, Karpovquickly and quietly fled the scene.andM;Forty-three seconds.andP;  That's how close it was.andP;  Closer, actually.andP;  Karpov wasthe beneficiary of a &quot;long count.&quot;andP;  Rather than 60 minutes, this timed matchhad allowed each player 61 minutes.andP;  Officials often give an extra minute toeach side when analog clocks are used to keep time, to compensate for anyinaccuracies in the setting of the hands, explains George Mirijanian, thematch's referee and president of the Massachusetts Chess Association.andP;  Had amore exact timekeeping device (say, a computer) been used, the game wouldhave been played to a 60-minute limit.andM;&quot;Without that extra minute, Karpov would have been over the time limit,&quot;Mirijanian confirmed.andM;Even with the minute tacked on to recognize the fallibility of the nondigitalworld, Deep Thought might have better exploited Karpov's time disadvantage,analyzers noted.andP;  In its earlier loss against Kasparov, Deep Thought had beenridiculed by chess experts for continuing to play long after its situationwas hopeless, merely delaying the inevitable.andP;  Kasparov had mockingly toldthe Deep Thought team to &quot;teach the computer how to resign&quot; (like a man,presumably).andM;This time, however, Deep Thought may have resigned too early.andP;  With anopponent down to 43 seconds, a human player would no doubt have played thegame to the bitter end, hoping to postpone the checkmate long enough to winon time.andP;  Sneakiness, like pride, is hard to encode digitally.andM;Delaying the inevitable is a strategic sidestep that computers don't need totake.andP;  People, however, are another animal.andP;  So champions like Karpov andKasparov continue to beat machines, even though most experts believe thatman's reign in the chess world won't last for long.andP;  Even Karpov predicted,before the match, that a computer will be able to beat the strongest humanplayer by the year 2000.andP;  No mystical barrier stands in the way of computers'steady improvement at the game; the pace of technology practically dictatesit, says programmer Campbell.andP;  &quot;It may take longer than we expect, but Ithink it's inevitable that machines will be better than people.&quot;andM;&quot;I don't know what it will do to the game,&quot; Mirijanian admits.andP;  &quot;For somepeople, the challenge will be gone, and they'll go on to something else.&quot;andM;For others, chess will remain the ultimate battle of wits--except when playedagainst a computer.andP;  Still others will embrace the machines.andP;  Even Kasparovand Karpov use chess computers, consulting them along with their humanadvisers during adjournments in tournament games, says Hsu.andM;&quot;World champions will never be computer-illiterate from now on,&quot; Hsupredicts.andM;It's certain that chess will change.andP;  Computers will become part of thelandscape in the chess world as they have in science and business.andP;  Asalways, they'll perform some tasks better than people do, help rewrite someof the old rules.andM;But not to worry, insist the men behind the machines.andP;  Humankind won't beginits slow spiral in oblivion once computers come to dominate the world ofchess.andP;  A computerized world chess champion, they explain, will signifynothing more cosmic than a remarkable technological accomplishment.andM;&quot;It's not man versus machine,&quot; Hsu concludes.andP;  &quot;It's man versus his owncreation.andP;  It's much greater for man when the creation wins.&quot;andM;INSIDE THE BRAIN OF IBM'S DIGITAL CHAMPandM;What makes Deep Thought play such a great game of chess?andP;  A combination ofbrute strength and programmed intelligence.andM;Deep Thought is the fastest chess computer ever built.andP;  Its custom-designedcircuitry can analyze about 800,000 chessboard positions per second.andO;Translated into real-life chess moves this speed allows it, during athree-minute turn in a typical midgame, to preview every conceivablearrangement of pieces on the chessboard for the next five moves by eachplayer (or ten &quot;ply,&quot; in computer-chess lingo).andM;Looking ahead at millions of chessboard possibilities and numericallyevaluating each one is the very non-human way chess machines pick theirmoves.andP;  Whereas a human player will likely approach each new move bydetermining whether a previously devised strategy is still operable, acomputer has no concept of strategy.andP;  If faces each move as if it werestarting a new game.andM;The machine first looks at what moves it might make and &quot;scores&quot; each basedon the strengths and positions of the pieces that would remain.andP;  It thenenvisions its opponent's reply to each possible move and scores thechessboard arrangements each of these would leave.andP;  It projects as far intothe future as time permits and makes the move that, generally, leads to thehighest scores.andM;This brute-force approach, called a &quot;minimax&quot; search, would work flawlessly(in theory, at least) if a computer could calculate in advance a successfulreply to every move its opponent might make for an entire game.andP;  (It worksfor tic-tac-toe, where you can play every game to a tie by knowing andavoiding any move that leads to a sure loss.)andP;  But to &quot;solve&quot; chess in thismanner is completely out of the question, even for a machine of this speed,says Deep Thought programmer Murray Campbell.andM;The number of possible positions grows exponentially with each ply deeper thecomputer goes, creating a problem of insurmountable breadth--a phenomenonmathematicians call a &quot;combinatorial explosion.&quot;andP;  On average, a chess playerhas 38 legal moves from which to choose on a given turn.andP;  Thereafter, theopposing player has about 38 possible replies to each of those 38 moves.andP;  Soa machine has to examine 1,444 (38 x 38) scenarios to anticipate everyposition that could exist after one move by each player.andP;  Extrapolate thatover many moves and you get astronomical numbers.andP;  There are [10.sup.43]possible configurations for the pieces on a chessboard.andP;  Deep Thought may beable to analyze nearly [10.sup.6] (one million) positions per second, butafter a year of number-crunching it would be up to perhaps only [10.sup.12].andO;If Deep Thought's handlers directed the machine to pre-examine allpossibilities in a game 65 moves long (the length of the Karpov exhibition),it would take &quot;several times the lifetime of the universe&quot; before making itsfirst move, Campbell estimates.andM;There are several ways to let a computer make good moves more quickly.andP;  Oneseems like cheating: supplying the software with a &quot;book,&quot; a database ofmoves that masters have used successfully for centuries.andP;  If a chess programconfronts a board situation that's in its book, it can move instantly withoutthinking a bit.andM;Deep Thought's book contains several thousand moves, including the famousAlekhine Defense and selected endgame combinations.andP;  But any book isnecessarily limited.andP;  Anatoly Karpov took advantage of this in his match bydeliberately putting Deep Thought &quot;out of book&quot; early, making an unusual moveon his fifth turn to force the machine to start working.andM;Making computers work more intelligently has been trickier.andP;  Deep Thought,like many chess computers, tracks how much time remains in a game andallocates time for each move accordingly.andP;  Within that time, it needs to&quot;prune the search tree,&quot; figuring out which lines of play are not worthpursuing to concentrate more deeply on the worthy ones.andM;Sort of the way people do.andP;  A human expert considers only 2 of the 38available moves in an average turn.andP;  The other 36--such as foolishly moving aqueen to a square where it will be captured--are dismissed, along with themillions of play-sequences each could inspire.andP;  A great human player thus mayget a fair idea of what the board will look like in 20 moves.andP;  This is why ahandful of people can still beat machines.andM;To approach humanlike discernment, chess computers employ a search techniqueknown as &quot;alphabeta,&quot; which lets them cut off many unfruitful avenues ofinvestigation before they become overwhelming.andP;  Under this technique, thecomputer assumes its opponents will play the best possible replies to itsmoves, and therefore it can decline to consider the long-term results ofanything else.andP;  This reduces the number of moves to be analyzed per ply to 5or 6 instead of 38.andM;Deep Thought's programmers have worked hard to strengthen the algorithms thatdictate its alpha-beta searches.andP;  They also have added a technique called&quot;singular extension,&quot; which lets Deep Thought project its own most promisinglines of play further into the future.andM;None of a computer's power or search tactics would be worth much without areliable way to &quot;score&quot; the millions of board positions it can envision.andP;  Achess computer's evaluation function may be the most difficult element for aprogrammer to compose, but computer time spent on wise evaluations can payoff more handsomely than time spent to deepen a search.andM;Each chess piece has a traditional numerical value (a rook is worth fivepoints, a knight three-and-a-half, and so on), but the values actually changedepending on a piece's vulnerability, mobility, workload, and level ofadvancement, as well as the stage of the game.andP;  For example, a pair of&quot;connected, passed pawns,&quot; which can advance side-by-side to offer mutualprotection, are usually worth more than two separated pawns.andP;  But twoisolated pawns may be better than &quot;doubled pawns,&quot; where one sits blockingthe other in the same column.andP;  There are many generally accepted principleslike these, and far more situations where no guidelines exist.andP;  Yet eachchess situation must be quantified to be made comprehensible to a computer.andM;Evaluation, by and large, is a human art.andP;  Deep Thought's programmers arecontinually refining the computer's scoring system, noticing something to becorrected after nearly every game.andP;  But they have supplemented their wisdomby building in software that lets Deep Thought analyze real-life chess games,checking the accuracy of the evaluations and tuning them where appropriate.andO;The team first ran 900 grand master-level chess games through the uniqueevaluation program.andP;  Since then, Deep Thought has been analyzing its owngames.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
