It provides anoverview of some of the features of specific machine architectures andtheir interaction with developments in software technology. The independentareas of multiprocessor and distributed programming, programming arrayand vector processors, and data flow programming are also examined indetail. Topics covered include: hardware technology developments; softwaretechnology developments; mutual exclusion; process synchronization; messagepassing primitives; Modula-2; Pascal Plus; Ada; Occam: a distributedcomputing language; Cray-1 FORTRAN translator: CFT; CDC Cyber FORTRAN;Illiac IV CFD FORTRAN; distributed array processor FORTRAN; Actus: aPascal-based language; data flow programming.</TEXT></DOC>
