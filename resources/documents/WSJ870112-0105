The maker of computer-aided publishing systems didn't say how many employees were involved.    It said the cuts result from automation, a slowdown in orders and increased competition. In the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, System Integrators' earnings rose 58% to $3 million, or 25 cents a share, from $1.9 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 35% to $19.2 million from $14.2 million. </TEXT></DOC>
