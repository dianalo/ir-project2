Forbes said in its Dec. 11 issue that only 16 entries on thelist went private this year in leveraged buyouts, down from 49companies last year.   Forbes ranked the 400 largest private firms according to theirestimated or reported total sales during the most recent fiscalyear.   Cargill, the international marketer of agricultural and bulkcommodities, topped the list for the fifth straight year.   Minneapolis-based Cargill reported 1988 revenue of $43 billion,up $5 billion from the previous year and more than double that ofthe second largest company on the list, Koch Industries, theWichita, Kan.-based oil company with sales of $16 billion.   Forbes estimated RJR Nabisco had sales of $14 billion last year,ranking it third after the company was taken private by the NewYork buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. The $30 billionleveraged buyout was the biggest corporate takeover ever.   A leveraged buyout is a corporate acquisition financed mainlywith borrowed funds that are repaid with cash from the targetcompany's cash flow or the sale of its assets. The technique hasraised concerns from some critics who believe such debt-burdenedcompanies are more likely to fail during an economic downturn,leading to layoffs and other problems.   Forbes defined a private company as one that has no publiclytraded stock. There are about 7 million private U.S. companies,compared with roughly 10,000 firms that are public.   There were 37 supermarket chains on the Forbes list, led byfourth-ranked Safeway Stores of Oakland, Calif., which had revenueof $13.6 billion. The list also had 14 real estate companies, 13oil companies, 8 transportation companies and 7 restaurant andfast-food companies.   Among others on the list were retailers Montgomery Ward andamp; Co.,ranked 16th with sales of $4.8 billion; Ralph Lauren's Polo RalphLauren, which moved up 42 ranks to 105th place after increasing itssales by $375 million to $1.3 billion, and L.L. Bean, theMaine-based outdoor gear company, which ranked 298th with sales ofnearly $90 million.   Other well-known companies included Donald Trump's TrumpOrganization, the real estate, hotel and airline holding company,which jumped from 217th place to the No. 99 spot after revenuesjumped from $700 million to $1.36 billion; Trans World Airlines,No. 20 with sales of $4.4 billion; Estee Lauder Cos., 67th withsales of $1.9 billion; Domino's Pizza, 79th with sales of $1.7billion, and Perdue Farms, 130th with sales of $1.1 billion.
