First, let mepoint out the following basic facts about the so-called&quot;separation of church and state&quot;: The Framers' words in theFirst Amendment, &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting anestablishment of religion,&quot; originally forbade merely&quot;Congress&quot; from establishing a national religion; individualstates, such as Connecticut, had official state religionswell into the second half of the 19th century.   The ACLU's &quot;big lie,&quot; of course, is that &quot;the Framers alsointended to prohibit the government from favoring religionover non-religion.&quot; ThisACLU-tenet-masquerading-as-historical-fact, however, isbelied by the facts that: George Washington's first officialact as president was a prayer to Almighty God; Congress, thepresident, the Supreme Court and most state governmentalbodies to this day regularly invoke the guidance of theSupreme Being; and, frustrating as it may be to the ACLU, thesolicitor general's position that &quot;a Sunday mass sponsored bya town on public property would be constitutional&quot; is no moredisturbing to most Americans today than George Washington'sfirst official act as president was to the other Framers 200years ago.</LP><TEXT>   The beauty and strength of the American system is that the&quot;church&quot; and the &quot;state&quot; are in fact the same people. And,just as the men and women of our 13 Colonies codified the TenCommandments in their respective statute books (some actuallyciting chapter and verse), the current laws of all 50 statesstill include each of the Ten Commandments in one form oranother. For example, every state still recognizes theexistence of one God; every state penalizes perjury; andevery state recognizes the Sabbath.   Whether the ACLU likes it or not, as long as we remain&quot;one nation under God,&quot; total separation of church and statein America will be at best a myth. Unfortunately, the morethe ACLU repeats its big lie, the more people actuallybelieve it.   Joseph E. Schmitz   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
