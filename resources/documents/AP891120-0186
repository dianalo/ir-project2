(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After 10 years, singer Ronnie McDowellhas finally accepted his role as ``the voice of Elvis.''   Until recently, the 39-year-old country music performer hasreluctantly used his voice as an Elvis Presley impersonation invarious TV shows and movies. But now he's set aside criticism thathe is just a Presley impersonator taking advantage of a deadentertainer. These days he's embraced the part as Presley'ssound-alike and made it a main segment of his career.   McDowell's singing voice will be used on the forthcoming TVseries ``Elvis Aron Presley,'' with Michael St. Gerard as Presley.McDowell also was the singing voice of Presley in the 1988miniseries ``Elvis and Me.''   In 1979, he was Presley's voice on 36 songs in the Kurt RussellTV movie ``Elvis.'' In 1984 he was Presley's singing voice foranother TV movie, ``Elvis and the Beauty Queen'' starring DonJohnson as Presley.   For the big screen, McDowell sang Presley songs for the movies``Sweet Dreams'' starring Jessica Lange and ``Breathless'' starringRichard Gere.   McDowell's Presley connection began when he co-wrote andrecorded the song ``The King Is Dead'' the day Presley died in1977. The song was a hit and McDowell became a quick celebritybecause of the record and because he sounded so much like Presley.   But in the years following, he found that his Presley-like voicehindered his own identity as a performer. He became known more forsounding like Presley than for his own records.   Now he's decided the Presley connection is a blessing.   ``I guess because I'm getting older, I don't mind theassociation,'' McDowell said in an interview. ``I think back towhen I was a kid, this was a guy (Presley) I really admired.   ``I feel ... I should be more honored than disgruntled about it.I've decided to embrace it and have fun with it, because I do myown thing, too.''   McDowell, who never met Presley, has had a steady career as acountry singer. He has released 18 albums and had No. 1 hits with``Older Women'' and ``You're Gonna Ruin My Bad Reputation.''   In October, he released country music's first animated musicvideo, ``American Music,'' which included cartoon characters muchlike the movie ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.''   McDowell also does imitations of country stars Johnny Cash,Marty Robbins and Ernest Tubb and jazz great Louis Armstrong.   ``Elvis is the one the people want to hear,'' he said. ``I doMarty Robbins or Johnny Cash equally as well. But it's always, `DoElvis!'   ``When I was a little boy growing up in Portland (Tennessee),I'd listen to the Grand Ole Opry on radio and I tried to emulateeverybody I heard. I got to the point I could sound like anybody.And Elvis came easier to me for some reason.''   McDowell was earning $237 a week as a lounge singer in BowlingGreen, Ky., when he recorded ``The King Is Gone,'' spending $2,800of his own money to make the record. Within weeks, he was doingconcerts that grossed $40,000. But he actually made less thanexpected off the record because of business failures by companiesassociated with it. Media accounts have said the record sold 3million, but McDowell believes it was closer to 5 million.   The song will be revived on a ``Best of Ronnie McDowell'' albumdue out soon.   McDowell also has been told that some of his versions of Presleysongs will be included in a forthcoming album of music by ``theking of rock 'n' roll.''   ``This is probably the peak of anything I'll ever do. What athrill this is for me.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Dec. 1-3</NOTE></DOC>
