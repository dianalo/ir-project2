The Fed's latest cut is expected to produce new lows inrates that will serve as the catalyst for a surge ofrefinancing of home mortgages and corporate debt. While theimmediate impact on consumer and capital spending or on thedepressed realestate market is likely to be slight, consumersand corporations will strengthen as they save money oninterest costs.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Every time you cut short rates by one percentage point,it's like giving $20 billion of free cash flow to thenonfinancial sector,&quot; says Neal Soss, chief economist ofFirst Boston Corp., who estimates adjustable-rate debtamounts to $2 trillion.   Here's how the Fed's action is seen affecting majorsectors of the economy and financial markets:                                                                                                          Consumer Spending                                                                                                          Consumers, increasingly fearful of losing their jobs,aren't likely go on a spending binge any time soon as aresult of the latest rate cuts. Nor will the cuts bringChristmas cheer to many elderly and retired investors andothers who rely on interest income from short-term Treasurybills and bank deposits.   &quot;This is not the push that is going to get people toborrow money and spend more,&quot; says Cynthia Glassman,economist with Furash andamp; Co., a Washington financialconsultant. &quot;The push will come when they perceive that theeconomy is turning around and that their jobs are secure.&quot;   Still, the baby-boomer generation, afloat on a sea ofcredit, will benefit as mortgages and other borrowing costsplunge, analysts say. Other big winners will be consumerswith home equity loans and other personal loans with ratestied to banks' prime lending rate. Many large banks cut theirbase rate one percentage point to 6.5% Friday.   But most credit card borrowers can expect little relieffrom high interest rates, which remain at about 18% even asmost other rates tumble. Bankers blame the high rates onsurging delinquencies and fraud. &quot;I doubt if banks are goingto pass on lower rates to cardholders,&quot; says Gerri Detweilerwith Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer group.   While consumers with existing loans are benefiting, thecuts won't spark a borrowing surge, analysts predict.&quot;Bankers don't anticipate a lot of demand for consumerborrowing,&quot; says a spokesman for the Consumer BankersAssociation, which surveyed several bankers. &quot;In a recessionconsumers are trying to save more money.&quot;   Rate cuts are bad news for savers with largeinterest-bearing accounts, some now offering record lowyields. For example, Citicorp's NOW checking accounts yieldjust 2%.   Investors who have stashed their savings inultra-conservative investments such as Treasury bills andmoney funds are also hurt by the latest rate cuts. &quot;Cashinvesting is an oxymoron,&quot; says Robert J. Barbera, chiefeconomist of Lehman Brothers. Three-month Treasury bills nowyield only about 3.8%. The average sevenday compound yield onthe nation's 520 taxable money-market funds fell to 4.7% inthe week ended Tuesday, the lowest level since the mid-1970s.   But investors with longer-term bonds are prospering. Asborrowing costs have nose-dived, bond prices have soared.Treasury bonds due in 10 years or more are still an excellentbuy, says Arthur A. Micheletti, senior vice president atBailard Biehl andamp; Kaiser Inc., an investment management firm inSan Mateo, Calif. He notes that 30-year Treasury bonds nowyield 7.6%. That is twice as much as the yield on three-monthTreasury bills. On a $50,000 investment, that represents anannual difference in interest income of $1,900.   Overall, according to government estimates, U.S.households will take in $415 billion in interest income in1991 and spend $339 billion in interest payments. Buthouseholds appear to be growing less -- rather than more --sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates as more ofthem opt for fixed-rate mortgages and shift money out ofmoney-market funds and certificates of deposit into stocksand bonds.                                                                                                          Corporate Finance                                                                                                          Corporate executives will be taking advantage of lowerrates to refinance and lengthen existing debt in a surge ofnew corporate bond offerings. That, in turn, will put moremoney in their coffers as they pay out less interest and willpush them further along the road toward greater financialstability.   While corporate financing for new projects is expected tostay weak, thus forestalling any quick fix for the economy,the benefits of the lower rates will redound throughoutcorporate America, say economists and Wall Street executives.They note that with $1 trillion in bank and commercial paperdebt, lower rates will mean billions of dollars in annualsavings as those obligations are rolled over on new terms.Small companies especially will benefit because their loanstend to be pegged to the prime rate, which fell twice as muchFriday as other short rates.   Moreover, the Fed's cut in short-term rates serves tobring bond yields down as short-term investors seek higherreturns from longer-dated investments. That will givecompanies a greater chance to replace higher-cost bonds withones carrying lower interest rates and to lock in cheaperrates for longer periods.   &quot;Corporations will come out of the blocks in January withheavy issuance of new bonds,&quot; says Richard Berner, a managingdirector and economist with Salomon Brothers. He expectslong-term Treasury bonds, which serve as the benchmark forcorporate rates, to decline to the 7% level in coming months,from around 7.6% Friday. He sees similar drops for 10-yearand five-year bonds as well because of continued lowinflation and a weak economy.   The lower rates, Mr. Berner adds, are likely to promptcompanies to step up their already fast pace of bondrefinancing. &quot;I've got to think this will help repair balancesheets, improve profitability and enhance credit quality,&quot;Mr. Berner adds.   &quot;Chief financial officers will see this as a rareopportunity to fix borrowing costs at relatively low interestrates long term,&quot; says John Lonski, chief economist ofMoody's Investors Service. He foresees long-term triple-Acorporate bond rates dropping below 8% for the first timesince a four-month stretch in 1977. This time, he expects thelow rates will last longer. He adds that a drop in rates &quot;canbe viewed as an unexpected addition to earnings that will bevalued all the more because of the current slowdown inearnings.&quot;   There might even be some inventory buildup because of thelower rates, suggests Mr. Lonski. He says that a drop inthree-month commercial paper rates for the highest ratedborrowers to 4.25% Friday from 4.67% the day earlier &quot;shouldhave a positive impact on inventories.&quot; Rates were as high as7.6% at the beginning of this year.   Of longer-lasting benefit to the economy will be thecontinued repair of many corporate balance sheets, whichbecame bloated with debt in the 1980s. Lower rates givecompanies the chance to lengthen bond maturities, whichpostpones the time when they have to pay back debt.   &quot;A 30-year bond&quot; at present rates is &quot;like equity,&quot; saysMr. Soss of First Boston. Economists also note that lowerrates make new issues of stock more alluring to investors,which goes even further toward bolstering corporate balancesheets.                                                                                                          Capital Spending                                                                                                          While lower interest rates make it easier for companies tojustify investing in new plants and equipment, the sluggisheconomy is expected to keep a lid on such spending.   Many U.S. companies remain committed to &quot;downsizing&quot; andare determined to slash costs and jobs. That process islikely to continue, which isn't positive for capitalspending. Even when companies step up spending for equipmentto enhance productivity, often those gains are offset in theeconomy by employment cutbacks, economists say.   &quot;I don't think this {the Fed's} action does anything tostop the decline in capital spending for the first half ofthe year,&quot; says Lacy Hunt, economist of HongkongBank group.&quot;It may have impact later on, provided the Federal reservesucceeds in reviving the money supply,&quot; the amount of moneycirculating in the economy. A pickup in money-supply growth-- and there are signs this is happening -- can work as amajor economic stimulus.   Manufacturers say they plan to reduce capital spending by0.5% in 1992, which would be the first drop since 1986,according to the Commerce Department. &quot;Manufacturers aren'tupgrading or expanding,&quot; says Gilbert Benz, economist atSwiss Bank Corp. in New York. &quot;They feel either demand willbe weak or current capacity {running below 80%} issufficient.&quot;   The bright spot, however, may be on the export front.David Hale, economist of Kemper Financial Cos., Chicago,thinks that the lowering of interest rates will lead to aweaker dollar. He notes that Germany recently raised interestrates. And while Japanese authorities will probably cut thediscount rate in the 1992 first half, they seem to be in acautious mood.   A weaker dollar will help exports, Mr. Hale says,including exports of capital goods. Exports remain one of thefew standouts in a sluggish U.S. economy. These exports &quot;willhelp prevent declines in capital spending,&quot; he noted.   The wild card in the Fed's rate action could be a positiveimpact on business confidence, says Mr. Lonski, of Moody's.&quot;The shift in Fed emphasis from defender of the purchasingpower of the dollar to being the engine of economic renewalcould improve the outlook of some companies and inducecapital spending,&quot; he says.   Residential Real Estate                                                                                                          Homeowners and would-be owners stand to benefitsubstantially from the rate cuts, which could drive 30-yearfixed-rate mortgages below 8%. This will bring more consumersinto the refinancing market.   But the effect on home sales is less certain. &quot;It's goingto keep the refinancing boom going,&quot; says David Berson,economist of Federal National Mortgage Association, or FannieMae. &quot;And that helps the economy. But what the Fed reallywants to see is people buying homes. Whether that happens isan open question.&quot;   The Fed's move should help drive down both fixed-rate andadjustable-rate mortgages. Economists differ on how muchlower rates could fall. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage ratesaveraged 8.59% last week, according to a survey of 2,000lenders by HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J., mortgageinformation service. Lawrence Horan, senior building analystfor Prudential Securities, foresees as low as 7.5% fixed-ratemortgages. Others predict that rates will fall only one morequarter of a percentage point.   Either way, the avalanche of refinancing is likely tocontinue.   As rates dipped this fall, the volume of refinancing shotup about one-third, according to the Mortgage BankersAssociation, which projects that $162 billion of the $540billion in mortgages originated in 1991 will be refinancings.   Jonathan Gray, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co.,New York, expects that as rates dip toward 8%, there will beanother flurry of activity from numerous homeowners holding10.5% mortgages. A common rule of thumb is that it pays forhomeowners to refinance when the mortgage rate drops twopercentage points lower than their current rate.   In addition, homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgageswill see their monthly payments adjust down automatically. Ahomeowner with a $100,000 mortgage whose rate drops from 8%to 7.5%, for example, would save $400 a year.   Refinancing done in 1991, coupled with downwardadjustments on adjustable-rate mortgages, will produce $10billion in savings to homeowners on their 1992 mortgagepayments, the Mortgage Bankers Association estimates.   Others estimate far greater potential savings fromrefinancings. Mr. Horan says that as much as $1.8 trillion inmortgages could be refinanced, resulting in after-tax gainsof as much as $30 billion a year for borrowers.   &quot;That could be almost as powerful {for the economy} as atax cut,&quot; he says.   Homeowners &quot;will be able to either reduce debt or spendmore,&quot; says John Tuccillo, chief economist for the NationalAssociation of Realtors. &quot;Both are going to help theeconomy.&quot;   A rebound in home sales would be an even greater boost tothe economy, because of the ripple effect it would produce.Lower interest rates, however, are likely to spark only apartial upturn. Many economists believe that sagging consumerconfidence will prevent broader advances.   The lower rates, however, will allow more people toqualify for mortgages, says R. Chad Dreier, chief financialofficer of Kaufman andamp; Broad Home Corp., a large Los Angelesbuilder, where sales have climbed in recent months as aresult.   &quot;I think you still have unfulfilled demand,&quot; says Mr.Tuccillo. &quot;These are people who still have jobs.&quot;   Brokers hope that an increase in sales of inexpensivehomes could free up the sellers to buy more-expensive homes.   Eventually, rate declines &quot;could help shore up housingvalues,&quot; says Edward O'Neal, vice chairman of ChemicalBanking Corp.   Homeowners have refinanced their home mortgages at ablistering pace this year, pursuing the lowest mortgage ratesin two decades. Last month, for example, the number of homerefinancings were up more than sevenfold over a year earlier,according to a refinancing index compiled by the MortgageBankers Association. &quot;They are off the charts,&quot; says WarrenLasko, the association's president. &quot;It just shows howclosely people are tuned in to interest rates.&quot;   This year, refinancings are expected to represent morethan 30% of all mortgage activity, compared with 16% in 1990.That translates into $165 billion of refinanced mortgages vs.$72 billion last year.   Even as rates keep falling, however, there is a limit tohow low most banks will stoop with mortgages. They could beburned, for example, by buyers who can handle payments whilemortgage rates are low, but not higher payments if theiradjustable-rate mortgages are revised upward. Thriftregulators have spent much of this year warning savings andloans to be wary of loading their balance sheets with fixed,30-year mortgages at low rates -- the phenomenon that gaverise to the Sandamp;L fiasco in the 1980s.   The interest rate drop recently prompted Fannie Mae, thebig buyer of mortgages, to tighten its guidelines for theadjustable-rate mortgages it will buy from banks. No matterwhat rate the bank offers the borrower, the borrower mustqualify for a 7% mortgage. Moreover, Fannie Mae won't buy anyloan that has first-year &quot;teaser rates&quot; more than 2.5percentage points below the going market rate.   &quot;If interest rates go up much, these mortgages aren'tgoing to make a whole lot of sense,&quot; says a Fannie Maespokesman.                                                                                                          Commercial Real Estate                                                                                                          While the rate drop is a step in the right direction, it'sunlikely to be enough to revive the moribund commercialreal-estate market. Developers with floating-rate debt willsee their cost of funds fall, and the few borrowers stillable to get credit will have lower rate-of-returnrequirements to meet. But real-estate specialists stress thatthe rate drop doesn't alter the fundamental problems ofoffice-space oversupply and a dearth of potential tenants.Only when the economy starts creating the jobs to fill emptyoffices will commercial real-estate markets improveappreciably, they note.   &quot;This helps real estate only by shoring up the economy andby improving employment and income,&quot; Aetna Life andamp; CasualtyCo. economist James Griffin says. &quot;But it is not an immediatepositive.&quot;   The lower rates won't solve the root of the real-estateproblem: a financial community that hasn't digested theoverbuilding and overborrowing of the past decade. Mr.Griffin says that until past lending mistakes are resolved,&quot;I don't think your typical bank or Sandamp;L will say, `Great,rates are down, let's go out and lend to more real estate.'&quot;Instead, he says, the lower rates will help the businessmarginally.   But others predicted that the decline in rates will soonmake real estate a more attractive investment. &quot;We're gettingto the point where you can make an argument in favor of therisk-return characteristics of real-estate investments,&quot; saysSteven Karpf, an investment banker with Eastdil Realty. Hesaid fully leased buildings without lease expirations in thenext few years could benefit the most.                                                                                                          Commercial Banks                                                                                                          The interest rate cut should eventually improve bankprofits and their customers' ability to make interestpayments -- which explains why bank stocks advanced Friday.&quot;By and large it's good for banks and good for ourbusinesses,&quot; says Edward O'Neal, vice chairman of ChemicalBanking.   Still, while borrowing ultimately should pick up nextyear, bankers and analysts say the near-term benefits will beless immediate. Few are expecting a surge in commerciallending, the economy remains weak, and banks are shrinking toimprove capital-to-asset ratios.   In addition, some cautioned that net interest margins --the difference between banks' borrowing costs and lendingratescould actually narrow. The key federal funds rate fellonly a half of a percentage point, while most banks cut theprime rate a full percentage point to 6.5%.   Historically, a drop in funding costs for banks waspositive because so many of their loans were at higher fixedrates. But now that banks increasingly use adjustable-rateterms to protect themselves from sharp interest-rate swings,their potential to benefit from a sharp drop in their cost offunds is limited.   Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. moved quickly after the Fed'sone-percentage-point drop to cut the prime lending rate to6.5%, even before knowing where the federal funds rateultimately would settle, and other money-center banksfollowed later in the day.   That means the margin between the cost of funds and therates charged to clients will shrink by half a percentagepoint. In fact, Minneapolis-based Norwest Corp. cut its primerate only to 7% on the belief that the federal funds ratewould fall only as much as it did, says Richard Kovacevich,president and chief operating officer. Banc One Corp. splitthe difference and lowered its prime rate by three-quartersof a point to 6.75%.   The last time the prime rate was 6.5% was in May 1977,when the federal funds rate stood at 5.35%. That ratedifferential contrasts sharply with the current spreadbetween the cost of funds and lending rates of around 2.5percentage points, indicating to some economists thecontinued tightness of bank lending. The narrowing spread,however, is a positive sign, given that banks have been slowto pass lower interest rates on to customers.   Bankers and analysts say the lower rates should help thecredit quality of both consumers and corporations with highdebt levels and thus reduce the banks' levels ofnonperforming loans and the reserves needed to cover thoseloans, bankers say.   But bankers stress that corporate loan demand remainssluggish. Most of the new bank financings have been torefinance existing debt, with few corporations increasingdebt to expand plant and equipment. &quot;We're open forbusiness,&quot; says Mark Solow, co-manager of global banking atManufacturers Hanover Corp. &quot;It doesn't appear that lowerinterest rates have dramatically changed the demand.&quot;   Banks are preserving capital for protection againstfurther unpleasant surprises in their existing portfoliosrather than making new loans, says Timo Aittola, senior vicepresident at the New York office of Konsallis-Osake-Pankki, alarge Scandinavian bank. The possibility of a second leg tothe recession &quot;takes away any eagerness to add new loans,&quot; hesays.   Says Allerton Smith, banking analyst at First Boston, &quot;AnyChristmas cheer from a cut in interest rates is likely to beshort-lived.&quot;   Ultimately, though, the two-year decline in rates isexpected to spur lending and economic growth, helping thebanking industry recover. &quot;I'm much more hopeful than I wasThursday,&quot; says Mr. Kovacevich, of Norwest. &quot;For the firsttime I think we're close to the bottom.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;Giant Step: Changing Its Course, TheFed Boldly Tries To Bolster Economy --- Gradual Interest-RateCuts Weren't Doing Enough -- For Recession or for Bush ---How Greenspan Turned Tide&quot; -- WSJ Dec. 23, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
