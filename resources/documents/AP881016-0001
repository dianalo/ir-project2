Bush, leading the presidential race with just over three weeksto go, said, ``I'm not going to mess up.''   Dukakis received endorsements from Hispanic law-enforcementgroups in Los Angeles and spoke at a rally there before flying toTexas for more campaigning. Bush, accompanied by Hollywood actorsand two of the Beach Boys singing group, led a bus tour of ralliesin seven California cities.   Dukakis' running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, said Saturdaythat despite polls showing Republican gains ``the momentum isours.'' But he also brought up a story generally cited only bypolitical longshots _ the 1948 newspaper headline incorrectlydeclaring Republican Thomas Dewey had defeated Democratic underdogHarry Truman.   ``I can't help but remember Harry Truman out there when thepress had written him off,'' Bentsen told a crowd at a farmers'market in St. Louis.   Dukakis managers held a day-long meeting in Boston and set outan 18-state strategy, focusing largely on economic issues, forimproving the Democratic nominee's election chances, The WashingtonPost reported in its Sunday editions.   ``The issues at stake are too important for the press and theRepublicans to shut this election down three weeks before ithappened,'' said Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach.   Under the strategy, the Dukakis campaign plans an ``all-out''drive in 18 states where Dukakis is favored or competitive, thePost reported. Those 18 states collectively have 272 electoralvotes _ two more than needed to be elected.   Bush's running mate, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, campaigned inWisconsin, telling cheering supporters in Eau Claire and Appletonthat the state ``is going for George Bush.''   At the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire, he ran intodemonstrators carrying signs questioning his military record. Hebrushed past them, saying, ``See you after the election.''   Bush's staff welcomed Quayle back to Washington with a rally andpresented him with a green medical uniform sporting the words ``Dr.Spin,'' in keeping with the Indiana senator's vow to give his own``spin,'' or interpretation, to campaign developments.   Dukakis has been striking back aggressively since Thursdaynight's debate, an encounter that polls indicate put him fartherbehind Bush.   He also has been hurt by tough Bush television ads accusing himof presiding over a Massachusetts prisoner-furlough system thatgave a weekend pass to a murderer who later attacked a Marylandcouple.   Dukakis said little about such charges for weeks but nowaddresses them vigorously and at length.   On Saturday, he called Bush ``cynical and hypocritical'' forseeking political gain from what Dukakis calls a tragic incident.   He spoke of murders in California by inmates on furlough duringRonald Reagan's governorship. And he said that while Bush has beenvice president there have been thousands of federal prisonfurloughs and an incident last year in which an inmate on furloughraped and murdered a mother of two in Arizona.   Dukakis also speaks of a murder and rape committed by a man whoescaped from a Houston halfway house Bush supported.   The governor said that he and Reagan took responsibility fortheir programs but that Bush has refused to take blame for hisfailures.   ``Talk versus action, TV commercials versus results, that's whatwe're dealing with here,'' Dukakis said, comparing Bush and himself.   He noted his state's 14 percent decline in the rate of majorcrime, and its lowest homicide rate among industrial states. Thatprogress, he said, resulted from his personal involvement in astatewide anti-crime council.   ``I didn't learn my lessons about crime from a Clint Eastwoodmovie,'' he told the law-enforcement officers. ``I've been outthere with you.''   ``This is an issue that is very close to me,'' he said. ``Itcomes right out of my gut.''   In his Texas appearance, Dukakis spoke warmly of the Texassenator who is his running mate.   ``Lloyd Bentsen and I have formed a partnership _ a partnershipfor the future, a partnership that will make America firsteconomically and militarily,'' he said at a San Antonio rally.``The two go hand in hand. You can't have one without the other andwe'll have neither if we elect George Bush and Dan Quayle to leadour country.''   Bush, who like Dukakis has been in California all week,campaigned Saturday with actors Telly Savalas and Chuck Norris andsingers Mike Love and Bruce Johnston of the Beach Boys.   He told reporters aboard his campaign plane that he was going to``go the extra mile to fight hard'' in the final 24 days of therace and wouldn't ``mess up.''   ``We're going to take the high road and leave the pessimism andthe tearing down of America to somebody else,'' he said.   ``Here we go ... entering the home stretch of this nationalpresidential election,'' Bush declared at a noisy kickoff rally inan airport hangar in Modesto.   He is pushing for an advantage in California, where the electionis still considered too close to call. In particular, he is tryingto energize Republicans and to keep the support of Democrats whomay have dropped their allegiance in order to vote for Reagan in1980 and 1984.   In Washington, President Reagan used his weekly radio address topraise Bush, criticize Dukakis and ask voters to supportRepublicans in House and Senate races. ``If we don't want atax-and-spend liberal in the White House, shouldn't we give thepresident a Congress that will work with him?'' he asked.   Rep. Dennis Eckart of Ohio, giving the Democrats' response, saidDukakis and Bentsen would do more than the Republicans to answerAmericans' most pressing concerns. He dismissed Bush as ``a silentpartner'' in a Reagan administration ``riddled with corruption,corruption that has reached into the president's cabinet, to thePentagon, from defense contractors to Wall Street.''</TEXT></DOC>
