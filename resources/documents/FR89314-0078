Excess deaths are the difference between actual minority deathsand the number of deaths which would been expected if the minority populationhad the same age- and sex-specific death rates as the white population.Every minority group does not suffer from excess deaths in each category.However, the six health problems became priority issue areas for Task Forcestudy. Listed in alphabetical order, they are:andbullet; Cancerandbullet; Cardiovascular disease and strokeandbullet; Chemical Dependencyandbullet; Diabetesandbullet; Homicide, Suicide, and Accidents (unintentional injuries)andbullet; Infant mortality <ITAG tagnum="84">HIV Infection</ITAG>In recognition of the severity of the problem of HIV infection and AcquiredImmunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) among the minority populations, Congressappropriated funds beginning in Fiscal Year 1988 for the Office of MinorityHealth to use in ways specifically targeted at HIV infection in minoritypopulations. One mechanism by which the Office of Minority Health targetedthis problem was to add HIV infection as a seventh health problem to theabove list of topic areas for this demonstration grant program in FiscalYear 1988. HIV infection continues to be one of the topic areas for thisprogram in Fiscal Year 1989. For applicant organizations that plan to submitHIV infection demonstration applications, it is important to describe existingefforts in HIV infection education and prevention in their local community(e.g., by the local or State health department or community-based organization),and how the applicants' proposed interventions to prevent AIDS or HIV infectionwould complement those existing efforts. Applicants are encouraged to communicatewith their State Departments of Health and Education, as appropriate. Please note that these Minority Community Health Coalition DemonstrationProjects are but one mechanism by which the Office of Minority Health intendsto utilize its Fiscal Year 1989 appropriation for HIV infection. For moreinformation on the Office of Minority Health's HIV infection initiative,please call Jacqueline Bowles, M.D., at (202) 245-0020.The risk factors for these seven priority areas involve behavior or preventableconditions which are potentially modifiable but are in some cases resistantto change. In order to effect health behavior change, an individual mustbe motivated beyond that typically achieved as the result of health informationor media campaigns alone. In addition, conventional health promotion activitiesare frequently not effective in reaching minority populations. It appearsthat change can be achieved by community-based information dissemination,awareness, support, and exhortation, particularly if such a community healthcampaign is carried out using familiar, as well as influential institutionssuch as churches and schools, and organized by recognized community leaders.Moreover, in many cases it may be insufficient to simply pressure individualsto change behavior without offering positive alternatives. For example,if teens are being encouraged to avoid use and abuse of drugs and alcohol,it may also be important to organize and offer constructive alternativessuch as career-oriented activities in non-traditional settings. The following is a list of the major health problems with their associatedmodifiable risk factors, some of which are implicated in more than onehealth problem:  <T3>Cancer:</T3> Tobacco, Diet, Alcohol, Environment.  <T3>Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke:</T3> Hypertension, Diet, Tobacco,Sedentary Life Style, Obesity.  <T3>Chemical Dependency:</T3> Direct Behavioral Outcome of Alcohol, andother Drugs of, Abuse.  <T3>Diabetes:</T3> Obesity, Diet.  <T3>Infant Mortality:</T3> Smoking, Alcohol, Drugs, Late or No PrenatalCare, Teen Pregnancy, Nutrition.  <T3>Homicide:</T3> Alcohol, Drugs, Poor Conflict Resolution Skills.  <T3>Suicide:</T3> Alcohol, Drugs, Depression.  <T3>Unintentional Injuries:</T3> Alcohol, Drugs, Environmental Hazards. <T3>HIV Infection:</T3> Intravenous Drug Use, and High Risk Sexual Practices,(e.g., Unprotected Intercourse, with Multiple Partners).  Many of the above noted risk factors are of interest to, and within thepurview of, a number of organizations within communities. In addition,community organizations have different and varying levels of influenceover the behavior of individuals.  This announcement is the fourth annual notice for this grant program. Inthe past Fiscal Year 1988, the Office of Minority Health received 91 applicationsof which 39 were approved and seven (7) grants awarded for a total of $1.4million. Fifty-two applications were disapproved because of various deficiencies.Several applications may have been in the approval range with some technicalassistance. Others would have required much more work in the pre-applicationstage. Given the time and resources typically involved in researching,developing, and writing an application, potential applicants should seriouslyconsider whether or not they should apply at this time or wait until theyestablish stronger linkages with other community organizations and/or developgreater expertise in planning and writing their proposal.  Applicants wishing to improve their chances for approval should pay particularattention to both the Supplemental and General Instructions provided withthe grant application to ensure that their applications are responsiveto each of the following concerns under the following headings:  Project Objectives 1. Clearly describe the goals and objectives of the proposed project, usingmeasurable terms;  2. Identify, describe, and document health problems areas and related riskfactors in the target population;  3. Include realistic timetables for accomplishing the objectives;  Target Population  4. Define the target population(s) and identify which interventions areproposed for which minority groups;  Coalition  5. Provide evidence that a valid community-based coalition exists or thatorganizations, which have worked together in the past, are now proposingto focus their energies on these disease risk reduction activities, anddescribe any coordinative or collaborative efforts with other organizationsserving the target population; 6. Describe in detail the organization of the coalition and the respectiveroles of coalition members and other participants;  Intervention  7. Describe plans for implementing the intervention(s), presenting in step-by-stepfashion the specific efforts to be undertaken by each key component ofthe coalition, and how these various efforts will address the problemsidentified;  8. Provide a detailed description of intervention strategies that addressthe board concept of the application rather than just an analysis of medicalrecords of minority individuals, as in a limited clinical trail;  Project Management and Staffing  9. Provide detailed management plans that clearly delineate each coalitionmember's area of responsibility and how specified key staff of member organizationswill be accountable for carrying out their responsibility;  10. Describe the duties and requisite qualifications of current staff,and of any staff and consultant positions to be filled after the grantaward; and 11. Identify and provide supporting documentation (e.g., curriculum vitae)for each individual proposed for key staff positions to show appropriateexperience and qualifications. Particularly suitable will be experiencein community-based programs and/or health promotion programs, as well asrelated treatment and research experience.Evaluation 12. In the evaluation section, specify the overall evaluation plans andthe particular process and outcome objectives, indicating how each of thesewill be measured, including the results of the interventions. <ITAG tagnum="84">Authority </ITAG>This program is authorized under section 301 of the Public Health ServiceAct, as amended. <ITAG tagnum="84">Program Objectives </ITAG>The objectives of the program are to fund projects which: (1) Provide epidemiological evidence of the health problem(s) and riskfactor(s) of the minority population(s) which are the targets of the applicant'sproposal. (2) Provide detailed and specific methods for (a) risk factor reductionthrough the use of a community coalition targeted to a specific minoritypopulation and to identified risk factors and (b) measuring the resultsof the intervention. (3) Demonstrate a sound organizational scheme for the coalition which assuresadequate involvement and representation of both coalition members and communityleaders. (4) Evaluate the process of establishing and operating the coalition andhow its activities will impact on the risk factors and health problem areasidentified in the target population through the community coalition. (5) Demonstrate experience of the applicant and some coalition memberswith community-based projects, either focused on health or other communityconcerns. (6) Provide evidence of potential sources of community and other supportfor the project at the end of the grant period. <ITAG tagnum="84">Definitions </ITAG>For the purpose of this grant program, the following definitions are provided:(1) <T3>Health problem areas</T3>_one of the seven priority issue areas identifiedin the Secretary's Task Force report or by the Office of Minority Health.They are: (a) Cancer; (b) cardiovascular disease and stroke; (c) chemicaldependency; (d) diabetes; (e) homicide, suicide and unintentional injuries;(f) infant mortality; and (g) HIV infection. (2) <T3>Risk factors</T3>_The environmental and behavioral influences capableof causing ill health with or without previous predisposition. The term``risk factor'' is also used to denote an aspect of personal lifestylesand behavior known, on the basis of epidemiological evidence, to be associatedwith one or more diseases or health conditions considered important toprevent. These include use of tobacco, poor dietary habits, obesity, severe emotionalstress, depression, poor conflict resolution skills, abuse of alcohol anddrugs, intravenous drug use, late or no prenatal care, teen pregnancy,high risk sexual practices, (e.g., unprotected intercourse, with multiplepartners), environmental hazards, and others. (3) <T3>Community</T3>_A defined geographical area in which persons live, work,and recreate and is characterized by: a) formal and informal communicationchannels; b) formal and informal leadership structures for the purposeof maintaining order and improving their conditions; and c) its capacityto serve as a focal point for addressing societal needs including healthneeds. (4) <T3>Community coalition</T3>_The coming together of individuals from andrepresentatives of organizations and institutions in a community for thepurpose of collaborating on specific community concerns, and seeking resolutionof those concerns. For purposes of this grant program, community coalitionsare characterized by the six elements listed below. A community coalition andbullet; Assumes a variety of interests converging on an agreed upon mission.andbullet; Requires resource participation. Each coalition member organizationbrings a certain resource to the coalition to enable the coalition to accomplishits mission. andbullet; Requires that each member organization has a specific role withinthe coalition. This rule, defined by the individual member, is distinctiveamong the other members. Use of resources may be one way of defining eachrole. andbullet; Requires that each member organization establish both a relationshipwith the coalition as an entity (vertical relationship) and with othermembers of the coalition (horizontal relationship). Members must be ableand willing to work with one another. Formalizing these relationships tomake explicit the specified roles may be achieved through development ofmemoranda of understanding/agreement between each member organization andthe coalition, and between members as necessary. andbullet; Requires a long term commitment on the part of each member organizationsince the problem to be addressed is not usually amenable to short termsolutions. andbullet; Must document its activities to ensure a written history of and,thus, a continuity to its work that is not dependent upon the active participationof any single person. Such documentation can include the memoranda of understanding/agreementmentioned above. (5) <T3>Minority populations</T3>_As defined by the Report of the Secretary'sTask Force on Black and Minority Health, they include: Asian/Pacific Islanders,Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans/Alaska Natives (which include NativeHawaiians). <ITAG tagnum="84">Availability of Funds </ITAG>The Office of Minority Health intends to make available approximately $1.4million under this announcement to be expended by grantees over a two-yearproject period. The specific amount funded will depend on the overall availabilityof funds. It is anticipated that seven individual grants of up to $200,000(total costs including indirect costs) each for the two-year project periodwill be awarded from these funds. OMH hopes to award at least one of theseven grants in the area of HIV infection, with priority given to applicationsthat target the Black or the Hispanic population. Such award, however,like all award decisions will be based on the types and quality of theapplications received. <ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant Eligibility </ITAG>Eligible applicants are public and private nonprofit organizations andfor-profit organizations <T3>except for all current grantees under this program, </T3>since thesegrantees are considered not eligible. The applicant organization is thelead agency for the coalition and is responsible for management of theProject and will serve as the fiscal agent for the Federal funds awarded.Federal domonstration grant support is not expected to result in more thanone award in any Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) unless anadditional project in an SMSA was to be targeted to another of the fourmajor minority groups_Asian/Pacific Islanders, Blacks, Hispanics, and NativeAmericans/Alaska Natives. Efforts will be made to achieve geographic andethnic distribution of awards as well as cover the various health problemsidentified above. There is no lower limit for the size of the populationtargeted by the applicant, but there must be a reasonable relationshipbetween the level of effort involved in the coalition and the size of thetarget population and the health problem(s) to be addressed. Similarly,the geographic distribution of the target population must be such thateffecting risk factor reduction is feasible. The target risk factor(s) must be epidemiologically justified on the basisof health problem patterns in the population. It is suggested that applicantslimit the number of disease or health problem areas to a primary one withone secondary problem area (with their associated risk factors) on whicha coalition plans to focus, as opposed to being all-inclusive, in orderto maximally utilize resources to achieve the greatest reduction in theselected risk factor(s).<ITAG tagnum="84">Applications</ITAG>1.

Also, funds may not be used to purchase equipment except asmay be acceptably justified in relation to conducting the project.6. Cost ParticipationIt is expected that a portion of the program's costs will be borne by coalitionmembers or by other non-federal sources such as business, labor, localgovernment, or community funds. Cost participation for those grants awardedin FY 1988 ranged between $40,000 and $289,000, and was either in-kindor direct funds contributions.7. Review CriteriaApplications will be reviewed and evaluated in terms of the evidence presentedin the application regarding the ability of the applicant to meet programobjectives. Of specific importance will be the following criteria underthe listed headings. (An indication of the quantitative weight appearsin parentheses after each heading.):Project Objectives (50%) andbullet; The scientific and technical merit of the described proposed project,and the consistency of the project's goals and objectives with those ofthe Demonstration Grant Program and the Office of Minority Health. andbullet; The justification for the choice of disease(s) and risk factor(s)to be targeted, and their direct relationship to the epidemiologic characterization(s)of the target minority population(s). andbullet; The degree to which the composition of coalition members is alogical choice based on target population, target risk factor(s) and intervention(s)to be demonstrated. andbullet; The degree of commitment of each coalition member to the coalitionand to the proposed implementation plan, including the amount or extentof support indicated by coalition members to cover a portion of projectneeds. andbullet; Coherence, feasibility, and realistic approach of the interventionstrategy and of the implementation methods described.

Project Management and Staffing (25%) Adequacy of qualifications and time allocations of proposed regular staff,both paid and voluntary, and of the proposed program and technical managementof the project. Appropriateness of relevant experience and qualificationsof the managers of the applicant organization to provide administrativeand fiscal management of the grant. Evaluation (25%) Appropriateness of the process and outcome objectives, and adequacy ofthe evaluation plan to measure the development of the coalition as wellas indicators and trends of outcome changes based on the goals and objectivesof the application. Likelihood that the project will demonstrate whetheror not community health coalitions can effectively promote risk factorreduction among minority populations. Likelihood that the project willcontinue beyond the two year funded project period. 8.
