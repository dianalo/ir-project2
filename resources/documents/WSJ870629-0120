Hutton Group Inc.'s securities unit was placed on leave of absence Friday pending a management review of allegations that he warned drug traffickers that they were under federal investigation.    Arnold Phelan, executive vice president in charge of E.F. Hutton andamp; Co.'s futures division, was recently cited as involved in a major Mafia drug-trafficking case -- nicknamed the Pizza Connection case in federal court in Manhattan.    Mr. Phelan wasn't named as a defendant or charged with any wrongdoing in the case. But U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, in a pre-sentencing memorandum filed in federal court here concerning 18 Mafia members and associates convicted in the case, claimed Mr. Phelan tipped some of the defendants to the government's investigation of the alleged money-laundering part of the case in 1982.    The memo, dated May 26 and released to the public June 19, describes three of the Pizza case defendants and two unindicted co-conspirators as smuggling $20 million cash through commodity accounts at Hutton and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. to Swiss banks and accounts under the control of other &quot;Mafia participants&quot; in the drug-trafficking enterprise. A Merrill Lynch spokesman said an account at that firm was open for only a few weeks, and closed when Merrill Lynch told the defendants that the firm doesn't accept more than $100 cash.    &quot;Things flowed along smoothly until the FBI started asking questions at E.F. Hutton in late September 1982,&quot; the memo said. &quot;Hutton's reaction was immediate. Arnold Phelan, a senior Hutton executive who had been dealing with (Vito Roberto) Palazzolo (one of the co-conspirators), caused the defendants to be warned about the government's investigation, which made them terminate this particular channel.    &quot;It was later learned in Switzerland by deposition that Phelan had been the recipient of a $15,000 gold watch from (unindicted co-conspirator Franco) Della Torre and Palazzolo prior to his warning the defendants in October 1982,&quot; the sentencing memo said.    In a statement issued through a spokesman early Friday evening, Mr. Phelan said he was confident that all of his activities at Hutton would be found to be &quot;completely legal and appropriate in the circumstances.&quot;    Mr. Phelan's spokesman added that he was amazed that &quot;transactions approximately five years old, which had long since been fully scrutinized by the U.S. Attorney's office . . . and with respect to which Hutton officials had full knowledge should now be raised as an issue.&quot;    The spokesman quoted Mr. Phelan as saying that he expects to be back as an active manager in the futures area shortly. Mr. Phelan was unavailable for comment.    A Hutton spokesman confirmed Friday that a management review was under way, but added that the firm stood by a June 8 statement in which it denied any impropriety. &quot;Once Hutton learned that the authorities believed some of the money might have its origins in organized crime, it immediately elected to refuse further cash deposits&quot; and turned away the suspect business, the statement said.    The June 8 statement added, however, that Hutton believes a government request not to contact the suspects about its investigation &quot;came after the contact had been made&quot; and conceded that &quot;there is disagreement between Hutton and government officials&quot; on this point. </TEXT></DOC>
