Gottschalk Jr.Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/06/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ARCPETROLEUM (PET) </IN><DATELINE> BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Atlantic Richfield Co.'s earnings for the rest of the year will be &quot;as good or better&quot; than profit in the year-earlier period if oil prices stay in the range of $18 to $20 a barrel, Lodwrick M. Cook, chairman, said at the annual meeting.    In the last three-quarters of 1986, Arco had net income of $316 million, or $1.74 a share. For the 1987 first quarter, Arco earned $239 million, or $1.31 a share, on revenue of $3.74 billion, compared with year-earlier net of $299 million, or $1.64 a share, on revenue of $4.28 billion.    Analysts have predicted that the company will earn about $4.60 a share this year, compared with $3.38 a share in 1986.    Mr. Cook said that actions taken last year to streamline the company have strengthened Arco in every area and have positioned it to make further gains as oil prices stabilize. The company has sold certain underperforming units, reduced personnel, cut back exploration, consolidated operations and reduced capital spending. It also has launched a $4.4 billion stock buyback program.    The Arco chairman said the company continues to believe that over the next five years, crude oil prices will be about $20 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate in 1986 dollars. But by the mid 1990s, he said, the company expects to see &quot;somewhat higher real prices.&quot; This forecast depends on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' &quot;ability to discipline itself,&quot; he added. West Texas Intermediate has been trading at $18 to $19 a barrel.    Mr. Cook said that he wasn't concerned about a possible takeover of the company. He said the company's strong stock price is the best defense against any takeover effort. Arco shares closed yesterday at a 52-week high of $88.75, up $2.75, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Robert E. Wycoff, Arco president, said the company projects that capital spending on the Alaskan North Slope, where it has three major operations, will total about $3 billion over a 10-year period.    The Arco president said he expects production from Prudhoe Bay, Arco's largest North Slope operation, to remain at 1.5 million barrels a day through 1989. Last year, the company had said it expected Prudhoe Bay production to remain at 1.5 million barrels daily only until 1988.    Mr. Wycoff said that because of recent tests, Arco is confident that its huge West Sak oil field on the North Slope can be developed with conventional recovery methods during the next decade &quot;if, as we believe, oil prices begin to improve.&quot; He added: &quot;We can't get oil out of West Sak at today's prices.&quot;    Mr. Cook said Arco has nearly completed the sale of certain oil properties, but that a few small California and Gulf Coast properties are still for sale. </TEXT></DOC>
