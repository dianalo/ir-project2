Harold Jenkins of the MaywoodPolice Department. ``Dealers figure they can come here and starttheir own thing.''   Authorities are uncertain why crack _ popular among drug usersfor years in other cities _ had been so scarce here. One theory isthat local drug kingpins kept the drug out of the area because theyfeared it would cut into their profitable trafficking in powdercocaine and heroin.   Now, crack is becoming a problem in some of the poorer southernsuburbs, and police fear poor city neighborhoods could be next.   In suburban Harvey, 539 drug arrests were made last year, andpolice say 95 percent of the narcotics trade in that suburb involvescrack, a smokable form of cocaine.   Crack dealers, police said, have invaded other urban centers byfirst establishing footholds first in outlying communities.   One dose of crack provides a much more intense high than cocainein powder form and sells for less money. As a result, crack ispopular in poorer communities and among the young.   For years, Chicago police have focused their drug activities onpowder cocaine and heroin abuse. While other cities reeled undersoaring homicide rates due to crack, Chicago's homicide rate in 1988dropped to its lowest level in 20 years.   Officials say the full extent of crack abuse in Chicago has notbeen determined. From February to June, police raided 20 crackhouses, said Sgt. Jim Brady.   Chicago gangs are believed to be playing a key role indistributing crack in the suburbs, and police are checking intoreports that Los Angeles street gangs may be involved. They haveintroduced crack into Kansas City, Mo., Minneapolis and other cities.   Police in suburban Robbins say their town has become known on thestreet as ``Rockville'' because so much crack cocaine is sold therein rock form.   On most nights, dozens of dealers sell crack openly in alleys andparking lots and on street corners, said Sgt. Charles Harris.</TEXT></DOC>
