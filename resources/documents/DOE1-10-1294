Standard optical waveguide design, installation in undergroundworkings (bending), joining waveguide sections and effects of using opticalwaveguides on transmission efficiency are investigated. Standard designof transmission systems with optical waveguides is described. The transmissionsystem developed by EMAG and cooperating with the CTT-32 automatic controlsystem used in the Szobierki mine is evaluated. Effects of optical-waveguidetransmission on reliability of control systems and safety in an undergroundmine are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
