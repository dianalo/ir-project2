WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   While West Germans struggle with growing hostilitytoward foreign workers, East Germans have happily opened the doorto them.   By official count, 90,000 Vietnamese, Angolans, Cubans,Mozambicans, North Koreans and Chinese are at work in East Germany.About 70,000 are Vietnamese.   With the longest standard work week in Europe _ 44 hours _ andevery pair of hands already employed, the East Germans concede thatto improve their economic prowess they need a little help fromfriends.   The foreigners take the least desirable and lowest-paying jobs,often working the night shift to turn out light bulbs in Plauen orshipping containers in Rostock.   Some spend free hours tailoring jeans outfits and custom-madeclothing for black-market sales to which East Berlin officialsdeliberately turn their backs.   ``We have to achieve higher production with an absolutelydeclining population, and we have temporarily found a solution byusing Vietnamese manpower,'' said Ekkehard Sachse, a leadinggovernment economics adviser. ``Naturally we have had someassimilation problems, but the end result has been verysatisfying.''   Foreign workers have been brought in for more than a decade tobalance the loss of working-age East Germans to emigration and asteadily falling birthrate.   But officials have only recently begun to acknowledge the extentof the foreign presence and their contribution to the East Germaneconomy, already the most prosperous in Eastern Europe.   The state-run television network broadcast a 40-minutedocumentary in early April explaining the advantages of importedlabor for East German society. The program aired twice during primeviewing hours appeared aimed at fostering positive attitudes towardthe foreigners and diluting resentment over the strains they put onshort supplies of housing and certain consumer goods, such assewing machines and bicycles.   ``Vietnam is very happy with this solution, as it solves some oftheir economic problems,'' said Sachse, head of the demographicsdepartment at East Germany's College of Economics. ``The Vietnameseworking in East Germany send money and consumer goods home. Weestimate they are improving the lifestyles of about a millionpeople there.''   Sachse said the level of foreign workers will grow through theyear 1995, but that authorities hope to avoid a long-termdependence on imported labor.   ``We don't want to have millions of foreign workers here,''Sachse said, noting that most of those working in East Germany aresingle, but a long-term dependence would mean providing permanenthousing and social services for foreign families.   Guest workers are officially limited to five-year stints, andmost live in dormitories or communal housing provided by thefactories and enterprises where they are assigned to work.   Many West Germans fear about 4 million guest workers in theircountry _ more than half of them from Turkey _ contribute to WestGermany's 8 percent unemployment rate, but East Germans view theforeigners as potential relief for their overburdened work force.   East Germany, along with its 44-hour work week, has fullemployment of working-age men and 92 percent of working-age women,according to a government study published late last year.   Sachse said in an interview that the pressure on women to workcontributes to the steady decline in births and to the nation'sastounding divorce rate. An estimated two-thirds of all marriagesin East Germany are eventually dissolved.   An average of 2.3 children per couple is needed to maintain thecurrent population of 16.7 million, but the latest statisticsindicate the average is 1.9 and falling, Sachse said.   He also confirmed Western estimates that the population droppedby about 20,000 last year because of legal emigration to the West,which is expected to continue at its current level for at least afew more years.   Western diplomats said 40,000 East Germans were grantedpermission to emigrate to the West in 1988, and that an estimated200,000 others have applied to leave.   Automation improvements in some industries have eased the burdenon a shrinking work force under growing pressure to produce more tosatisfy both domestic and export needs. But a chronic laborshortage persists, prompting East Germany to turn to its allies foradditional help.   While both East German and Western officials describe the importof foreign workers as a mostly positive influence on East Germansociety, the effort has not been problem-free.   East German media reports have alluded to incidents ofinter-racial strife, including a February article in Dresden'sSaechsische Zeitung reporting prison terms for two East Germans whopushed a worker from Mozambique in Africa from a moving train.   Officials contend racial incidents are rare, but concede thattensions run high over the foreign workers' tendency to buy updesirable consumer goods to take back home with them.   East Germany and Czechoslovakia enjoy a considerably higherstandard of living than their communist neighbors in Europe andallies in Africa and Southeast Asia.   Both nations slapped higher export tariffs on consumer goods atthe first of the year to stem the outward flow of the mostsought-after items, like bicycles, small appliances, shoes andbetter-quality clothing.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs May 18</NOTE></DOC>
