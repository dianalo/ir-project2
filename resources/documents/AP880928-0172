Col. Oliver North, is somewhat bewildered to find itself at thecenter of the presidential campaign.   Almost every day, Republican George Bush criticizes hisDemocratic rival as ``a card-carrying member'' of the ACLU. ``Myvalues are your values and they are not the values of the ACLU,''Bush told a rally on Monday.   Even the card-carrying member, Michael Dukakis, has backed awayfrom the group as Bush's relentless criticism apparently strikes achord with voters. To the dismay of ACLU officials, the Dukakiscampaign released a list of issues on which the Massachusettsgovernor differs with the group.   Throughout its 68-year history, the group has been associatedprimarily with the left, although it has come to the defense ofclients that span the ideological spectrum, from the CommunistParty to the Nazi Party, from the Ku Klux Klan to the BlackPanthers. It was founded in 1920, the outgrowth of an organizationformed to oppose U.S. involvement in World War I and to support therights of critics to speak out against the war.   ``You know, we don't choose our clients,'' said Ira Glasser, thegroup's executive director. ``If we are representing more people onthe left, it's because the government is prosecuting more people onthe left.''   Among those it has jumped to the defense of recently are formerWhite House aides North and Lyn Nofziger. The ACLU also hassupported, in recent years, the National Rifle Association and theNational Conservative Political Action Committee.   Most people don't associate the ACLU with those causes, ofcourse, and public education director Colleen O'Connor concededthat her role ``is a relatively new mission'' of the group. Sheconceded that the ACLU needs to do a better job of getting itsmessage out.   ``If ever there was proof of it, it's been in the past fewmonths,'' she said.   ``We don't expect Mr. Dukakis to guide his campaign by ouragenda, nor should we guide ours by his,'' she said. ``But ourconcern in all this is that he not fall into the trap that Bush haslaid ... for the ACLU in suggesting that our organization is out ofthe mainstream in most of our positions.''   That, of course, is precisely the point that the Bush campaignhas tried to make. In a speech earlier this week, Republican vicepresidential candidate Dan Quayle called on Dukakis to ``renounceall their bizarre positions.''   The positions most frequently cited are those on childpornography, tax exemptions for churches, decriminalization ofdrugs and prostitution and support for abortion and gay rights.   For the most part, ACLU officials don't deny that theorganization holds the positions for which it is attacked.   It opposes all censorship, maintaining that even childpornography is protected by the First Amendment. However, officialsstress that they favor laws that preclude the exploitation ofchildren for pornography.   It opposes tax exemptions for churches on the basis that theyamount to government subsidization of religion _ internally, one ofthe organization's most controversial stands.   It favors the decriminalization of drugs and prostitution asvictimless activities. And it strongly supports gay rights and awoman's right to choose an abortion.   ACLU officials complain, however, that conservatives havehand-picked a few of the group's most controversial positions andignored the others.   ``We take positions on hundreds of issues, and it would be realunusual if anybody agreed with all of them,'' said Glasser. ``Infact, I think it's fair to say that I don't agree with all ofthem.''   Glasser decried the ``basically uninformed and McCarthyiteflavor'' of the Bush attacks, while stressing that the ACLU isnon-partisan and will not take sides in the presidential race.   It will, however, strike back at Bush. ACLU leaders are busyreadying newspaper advertisements, speeches and the group's firsttelevision commercials. One commercial will feature Burt Lancasterdeclaring: ``I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU.''   The phrase, in fact, seems to have gained a certain cachet inACLU circles. Ms. O'Connor said hundreds of people have written thegroup in recent weeks to ask ``if they, too, can be a card-carryingmember of the ACLU.''</TEXT></DOC>
