These wavesare bunches circulation over orbit with angular velocity equal to thefrequency averaged over all particles. The existence of such waves ifdissipation is present in the system is shown. The bunch stability isinvestigated by the computerized simulation method. It is shown thatbunches with the energy spread smaller than the linear theory thresholdare stable against long-wave disturbances if their angular size is smallenough. Coherent stability of a set of symmetrically placed over theorbit bunches could be achieved by implied electromagnetic wave of moderateamplitude travelling over the orbit. 5 refs.; 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
