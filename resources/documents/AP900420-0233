(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Caterpillar Inc. today announced it hasimplemented a white-collar hiring freeze after the company's profitfell short of last year's performance for the second consecutivequarter despite record sales.   Caterpillar earned $99 million in the first three months of1990, a 30 percent from from last year when the first-quarterprofit was $141 million.   The quarterly income translates to 97 cents per share of commonstock for Peoria-based Caterpillar, the world's largestmanufacturer of earth-moving equipment. In the first quarter of1989, per-share income was $1.39.   ``We certainly are not ecstatic but we're not extremelydisappointed,'' said Len Kuchan, Caterpillar treasurer. ``We won'tbe happy until we get our costs down.   ``The results are generally what we expected, although saleswere stronger than we anticipated,'' he said.   Income dropped despite record first-quarter sales of $2.86billion _ a 10 percent increase from the first quarter of 1989 whenCaterpillar reported sales of $2.62 billion.   Total revenue, which includes sales plus revenue from financialsubsidiaries, was $2.9 billion for the quarter, the second-bestquarter in Caterpillar's 75-year history. The company's revenue was$2.68 billion in the same quarter last year.   The all-time high for revenue was $3.04 billion in the secondquarter of 1989.   The hiring freeze applies to all management or salariedemployees, said Kuchan.   He said a company reorganization, which created profit-drivenmanagement centers, has resulted in a reduction ofmiddle-management jobs and some salaried workers.   Workers with two years experience or more have been given theopportunity to be retrained for new jobs or wait in a transitionalpool of displaced workers until an opening is created.   Kuchan said no layoffs of salaried, or blue-collar workers, isanticipated in 1990, although they could occur if the nation'seconomy sinks into a recession.   Kuchan blamed the low profit level on increased costs due tosoaring health care expenses, plant modernization programs, highermaterial costs and the trouble in key markets.   He said the U.S. housing industry has been sluggish, along withcommercial and industrial development, giving Caterpillar fears ofa recession.   Overseas, the company has been hurt by ecomonic chaos in Braziland recessions in Australia and the United Kingdom.</TEXT></DOC>
