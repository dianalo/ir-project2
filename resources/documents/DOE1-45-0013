Five open reading frameswere found in the sequence. Four corresponding protein molecules weredetected by a DNA-directed in vitro translation system. Escherichia colicells containing the fragment with the four open reading frames transformedbenzene to cis-benzene glycol, which is an intermediate of the oxidationof benzene to catechol. The relation between the product of each cistronand the components of the benzene oxidation enzyme system is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
