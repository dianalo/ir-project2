The losses that year eventually led to Continental's 1984 collapse and subsequent government bailout.    After a day and a half of deliberations, the eight-person jury concluded that the Cleveland-based accounting firm wasn't negligent in its audit of Continental's 1981 financial statement. The civil suit had been brought by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and some former Continental shareholders.    Ernst andamp; Whinney's victory could make the FDIC less aggressive in seeking big damages against auditors of failed banks. The federal agency, which sought nearly $200 million in this case, is seeking about $250 million from Ernst andamp; Whinney in a case in Knoxville, Tenn., involving the collapse of banks owned by the Butcher brothers.    An FDIC spokesman said the agency was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the case's outcome and added that it was &quot;evaluating&quot; the possibility of appealing the verdict. The agency won't make a decision on whether to appeal for a few weeks, he said.    The shareholders' attorney, Nicholas E. Chimicles, couldn't be reached for comment.    Ernst andamp; Whitney Chairman Ray Groves said, &quot;We are pleased with the verdict and the jury's recognition of the quality of our audit.&quot;    Legal experts familiar with accountants' negligence problems said the jury's exoneration of Ernst andamp; Whinney is positive for the entire accounting profession. &quot;It's a plus for accountants in that it renews their faith that future juries won't hold them to impossible standards,&quot; said Dan Goldwasser, a New York attorney who consults on legal matters for the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants.    Mr. Goldwasser also said that the decision will take some of the pressure off the major accounting firms in the future to settle out of court, &quot;when they believe they have a good case.&quot;    Since 1981, major accounting firms have made out-of-court settlements totaling more than $250 million in negligence cases filed by investors, vendors and suppliers of companies they have audited. In most instances, the suits were filed after the CPA firms issued a clean opinion on financial statements of companies which soon afterward encountered severe business problems or filed under federal bankruptcy statutes.    As previously reported, sources have said the FDIC once offered to settle with Ernst andamp; Whinney for $20 million, and that the accounting firm offered the FDIC about $2.5 million.    Cecil Underwood, assistant general counsel for the FDIC, believes yesterday's decision &quot;is going to further hamper our efforts to settle these kinds of cases out of court.&quot;    The FDIC, however, had a tough case to prove. The agency and former shareholders charged Ernst andamp; Whinney with massive failure in its audit of Continental's 1981 books. The following July, Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City was closed by federal regulators, and Continental began disclosing that the $1 billion in oil and gas loans it bought from the smaller bank were mostly bad.    In the 19-week trial, Ernst andamp; Whinney argued that the FDIC should be barred from any recovery of damages, because Ernst said Continental officials withheld important information from the auditors. That included a bank investigation, under way at the time, of personal loans made by Penn Square to Continental Vice President John Lytle.    As previously reported, Mr. Lytle has since been indicted on wire and bank fraud charges, and federal prosecutors have said the Penn Square loans were part of a kickback scheme. Mr. Lytle has denied the charges.    FDIC attorneys argued that those charges were irrelevant to whether Ernst andamp; Whinney did an adequate job of auditing Continental, Mr. Underwood said. </TEXT></DOC>
