<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-79-0467 </DOCNO><TEXT>Thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) is used in only 1% of the total rubber andplastics in electric cable and wire fields. This report describes onthe legal regulations, practical applications, and the future problems.Japanese regulation on the power cable is the use of specified materialsonly, whereas in Europe and USA the function of the material is givena priority. For the communication cable and for the material selectionof electronic and household wires, the priority of selection is the functionof the material. Merits of TPE in use are the specialty properties unknownin the conventional materials, non-necessity of crosslinking, and thehigh productivity. PE is mainly used for the communication cable, PEand PVC for sheath. Telefone cord is the biggest outlet of TPE presently.Other applications are found in connection cable between the OA equipments,shield wire, and insulation cables for robots, aeroplanes, and oceandevelopment units, etc.. For more expansion of applications, balancebetween the flexibility and various properties, water resistance andprice should be improved. (7 figs, 3 tabs, 3 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
