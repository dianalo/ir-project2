Jurors, who on Friday convicted Heidnik of first-degree murderin the slayings of Sandra Lindsay and Deborah Dudley, deliberatedabout 90 minutes before reaching a verdict on a sentence. Thesentence will automatically be reviewed by the Pennsylvania SupremeCourt.   During a sentencing hearing today, a prosecutor had asked thejurors to impose the death sentence. They could have sentencedHeidnik to life in prison.   ``This man is legally sane and he knew what he was doing and hedid it with torture,'' Assistant District Attorney CharlesGallagher told jurors, who could have given Heidnik a life sentence.   ``Death is the correct sentence,'' Gallagher said.   Heidnik's lawyer, A. Charles Peruto Jr., appealed to the jurorsto consider that Heidnik suffers from a severe mental disease.Heidnik did not testify at the sentencing hearing.   ``I just hope you do the right thing,'' Peruto said after beingdirected by Common Pleas Judge Lynne Abraham not to rehash previoustestimony from the trial, which featured survivors' tales ofcannibalism and sadism.   The jury on Friday rejected Heidnik's insanity defense,convicting him of two counts of first-degree murder, six charges ofkidnapping, five of rape, four of aggravated assault and one ofinvoluntary deviate sexual intercourse.   Peruto said Friday his client expects the death penalty andwants no appeal.   ``Don't bother,'' Peruto quoted Heidnik as saying. ``Let's getit over with.''   Heidnik, 44, was accused of butchering the body of one woman hehad abducted and then feeding some of her cooked flesh to fourother abducted women he imprisoned in his North Philadelphiabasement, which was labeled a ``house of horrors'' during the trial.   Prosecutors say he raped the women repeatedly in hopes ofbreeding ``a superior race'' between November 1986 and his arrestin March 1987. The four survivors testified at his trial.   Heidnik's attorney conceded that his client committed thecrimes, but said he was mentally ill and was not aware of what hewas doing.   If the jurors fail to agree on a sentence on the two murdercounts, the judge must automatically impose a life in prison term.   The judge will impose a sentence on the other charges later.   The jurors, chosen in Pittsburgh because of pretrial publicityhere over the bizarre case, received the case Wednesday and, overthree days, spent nearly 18 hours before reaching their unanimousdecision.   There was one verdict of innocent, on a charge of involuntarydeviate sexual intercourse with a prostitute who had escapedHeidnik's house in March 1987 and brought police to the rescue ofthe other three chained women.   ``Thank God it was guilty of first-degree,'' said Teresa Lomax,sister of Sandra Lindsay, whose body was sawed apart in Heidnik'shouse after she died while chained to a pipe, according to police.Some of her remains were fed to other captives.   ``He deserved, `Guilty, guilty, guilty.' Now I'm hoping for thedeath penalty,'' Ms. Lomax said. ``That was a brutal way for mysister to die, tortured. Nobody deserves to die like that.''   Diane Dudley said Heidnik ``got what he deserved'' forelectrocuting Deborah Dudley, her sister, by touching live wires toher chains while she stood in a water-filled basement pit. Her bodywas found in a wooded area in New Jersey.   ``Now I hope he gets the chair and Debbie can rest in peace,''Ms. Dudley said.   Peruto called the verdict ``a big letdown'' because he hadthought his insanity defense had made an impact on the jurors.   Gallagher was elated and called it ``a just decision.''   In closing arguments, Peruto told jurors Heidnik was a``fruitcake'' who suffered from schizophrenia, a mental illnessfirst diagnosed in 1963 and for which he was discharged from theArmy. He contended Heidnik suffered from delusions and ``didn'trealize the quality of his acts.''   Gallagher insisted that Heidnik was faking the illness.   Peruto had claimed Heidnik was treated with LSD while a hospitalpatient during Army service in West Germany in 1962, but said hewas unable to obtain hospital records.   Heidnik later founded a church in which he proclaimed himself abishop, and allegedly used contributions to the church to play thestock market. His stock transactions were so successful that heamassed more than $500,000.   Despite his wealth, Heidnik lived in a poor neighborhood andappeared in court in tattered clothes.</TEXT></DOC>
