Now as then, the dollar is the key.   Bond prices had been depressed early in the week in response tothe government's latest report on unemployment, which showedanother drop in the jobless rate in March.   Strong economic news is often read as a negative signal by bondtraders because it portends a jump in inflation, which would dilutethe value of fixed-rate investments.   But by week's end, bond prices had rebounded as the dollarstabilized in foreign-exchange trading and inflation fears subsided.   The yield on the Treasury's closely-watched 30-year bond, up ashigh as 8.90 percent on Monday, settled back to the 8.75 percentrange, where it had finished the previous week.   The yield on the long bond moves inversely to its price.   The battered dollar was lifted by reports that finance ministersof the seven major industrialized countries would seek to stabilizethe U.S. currency at a meeting this coming week in Washington, D.C.   The dollar is monitored by the credit markets as a sign of whereinflation might be headed. A falling dollar raises the prospect ofimport-led inflation as well as the possibility that foreigninvestors may not expand dollar-denominated holdings.   Last April, the dollar's steep decline hammered bond prices,catapulting the yield on the long bond from 7.81 percent on March31 to 8.70 percent on April 24 _ its highest level since February1986.   That agonizing April cost brokerage firms around $650 million intrading losses on bonds, reckons Perrin Long, a securities industryanalyst for Lipper Analytical Services Inc. Bond traders called ita month of Bloody Mondays.   Hardest hit was the sprawling, less liquid municipal market.Prices there fell sharply as nervous investors rushed to redeemtheir mutual fund shares.   A year later, the precarious nature of the dollar's recovery hastraders wondering if history could repeat itself this April.   ``There's this lurking negativism,'' said William V. Sullivan,director of money-market research for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.``If the dollar continues to weaken, it is the problem for the bondmarket this April as well.''   The dollar's firmness could soon be tested if the industrialpowers that comprise the Group of Seven _ the United States,Britian, France, Italy, West Germany, Japan and Canada _ fail toprovide fresh support for the U.S. currency.   In addition to the upcoming meeting of the G-7 financeministers, the markets will have to digest another U.S. merchandisetrade report, due out Thursday. If report shows a lack ofimprovement in the U.S. trading deficit in February, the dollar andbonds could come under renewed pressure.   The dollar has been pushed down in recent months by negativenews on the trade deficit _ which has indicated to traders that thecurrency might have to fall further in order for U.S. exports to besufficiently competitive.   The February trade figures and the parley of the Group of Sevenmay well seal the bond market's fate for this April.   ``I think we're playing a waiting game,'' said John V.Sebastian, executive vice president of Clayton Brown andamp; Associates,an investment firm based in Chicago.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions April 9-10</NOTE></DOC>
