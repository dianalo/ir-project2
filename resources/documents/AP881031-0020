The Fish and Wildlife Service, in a little-noticed decisionpublished in the Federal Register, agreed to consider listing themarbled murrelet as an endangered species.   The agency found that a National Audubon Society petition forlisting the bird ``presented substantial information indicatingthat the requested action may be warranted.''   Not much is known about the marbled murrelet, a robin-sizedseabird that seems to swim better than it walks or flies. Butscientists are convinced the bird nests almost exclusively in theold-growth timber that towers over the coastal regions of theNorthwest _ some of the oldest forests in North America.   Listing the bird as endangered or threatened could result in aban on cutting trees that are prized by the timber industry fortheir top-quality logs and premium market price.   Timber industry officials accuse environmentalists of using themarbled murrelet to attempt a ``backdoor'' prohibition againstold-growth timber harvesting on public lands.   ``It sounds like a red herring,'' said Jay Goldstein, aspokesman for the Washington Forest Protection Association whichincludes among its members some of the largest forest-productscompanies in the Northwest.   ``We need to decide what to do and get on with it,'' saidGoldstein. ``But let's not play games and use soft little birds todefraud the process. These never-ending tactics aimed at foilingthe process are irresponsible.''   Environmentalists don't deny that they are waging a battle tohalt the cutting of old-growth timber, but add that the marbledmurrelet is worthy of protection in its own right.   ``We are going to make the survival of the ancient forest anational issue,'' said Brock Evans, an Audubon Society vicepresident. ``This is not just a problem for the Northwest. Everyoneowns these forests. It's like saying the Grand Canyon only belongsto the people of Arizona.''   Caught in the middle is the Fish and Wildlife Service, whichrecently declared that another bird that nests in old-growthtimber, the spotted owl, wasn't worthy of listing as endangered orthreatened. That decision is now being reviewed in a lawsuitbrought in federal court in Portland, Ore.   ``What we have to answer is how important is old growth to themarbled murrelet,'' said Jim Bottroff, a Fish and Wildlifebiologist based in Portland.   The Audubon Society believes that the bird could eventuallybecome extinct if logging of the old-growth forest continues.   According to biologists' estimates, only 3,400 breeding pairs ofmarbled murrelets remain in Washington state, maybe 2,400 breedingpairs in Oregon and less than 1,000 in Northern California.   Estimates for Alaska range up to 50,000 breeding pairs and thebird is also found in Western Canada.   Jim Pissot, an Audubon Society specialist, said that since theturn of the century people have been trying to discover where themarbled murrelet nests.   ``Now we know or think we know: 150 feet up on the thickbranches of old-growth trees,'' said Pissot. ``They are verydependent on old growth.''   Environmentalists believe that more than 160 species may bedependent for survival on old-growth forests.   ``The spotted owl and the marbled murrelet are just the tip ofthe iceberg,'' said Evans. ``They dramatize what is at stake.''   The U.S. Forest Service has estimated that about 7.5 millionacres of old growth remains in the Northwest with more than 80percent of it on national forest lands.   Plans call for cutting about half of that total over the next 50years and Forest Service officials have warned that unless it iscut the region's timber industry could collapse.   Environmentalists say the Forest Service estimates are grosslyinflated and even include trees that were destroyed by the 1980eruption of Mount St. Helens.   They also say that the old growth is being cut at the rate ofmore than 170 acres a day _ the equivalent of roughly 129 footballfields.   Congress asked the Forest Service to survey the remaining oldgrowth and to come up with a common definition for an ancient tree.   A Forest Service task force earlier defined old-growth trees asbeing at least 200 years old and almost three feet in diameter.   Environmentalists say that definition is too narrow and thatofficials also should take into account how many of the trees arein a given area and whether it has the characteristics of a matureforest.</TEXT></DOC>
