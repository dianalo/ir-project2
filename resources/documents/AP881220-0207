Japan's juggernaut economy has accommodated to U.S. pressure toincrease domestic demand for imported goods, but as 1988 ended,exports also were on an upswing, threatening more trouble for theenduring U.S. trade deficit.   The ``Little Dragons'' _ South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan andSingapore _ had economic growth rates of 6 to 11.5 percent in 1988,with much of their production aimed at the lucrative U.S. market.   Political strife in newly democratized countries like thePhilippines and South Korea will cause uneasiness, and bothcountries have growing domestic opposition to strategicallyimportant U.S. bases.   Another problem with the Philippines for Bush is how tocoordinate with Japan and Western Europe on an aid package to helpreduce the country's $28-billion debt, and not break the U.S.Treasury.   In Indochina, Washington will have to figure out how the emergingChinese-Soviet rapprochement will affect the drive to getSoviet-allied Vietnam to withdraw from Cambodia without permittingthe China-backed Khmer Rouge guerrillas to return to rule.   Washington supports the mercurial Prince Norodom Sihanouk asleader of Cambodia after a Vietnamese withdrawal, and will facerenewed calls from Hanoi to normalize relations, since Vietnam isincreasing cooperation on refugees and on resolving cases ofAmericans missing from the Vietnam War.</TEXT><HEAD>ASIAN SUBCONTINENT</HEAD><BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush will have to chart a newAmerican course for the superpower contest in the Asian Subcontinentas the Kremlin shifts its focus in Afghanistan from an overtmilitary role to preservation of its political influence.   The Soviet Union, which is scheduled to end its 9-yearintervention in Afghanistan by Feb. 15, recently bypassed PresidentNajib and opened its first publicly acknowledged talks with some ofthe Afghan guerrillas fighting the Moscow-client regime.   If Moscow neutralizes at least some guerrilla groups throughnegotiations, the United States may have to decide whether torecognize a post-Najib government or to continue supporting anyguerrillas who go on fighting.   Bush will also be dealing with a new leader in Pakistan, PrimeMinister Benazir Bhutto, who has vowed to continue good relationswith Washington but seeks to improve ties with Moscow. Heavymilitary aid to Pakistan still will be needed to counter Sovietinfluence, political or military, in neighboring Afghanistan andIndia and to satisfy the politically powerful Pakistani armed forces.   India, the Subcontinent's biggest military and political force,has improved ties with Washington while remaining friendly withMoscow under Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Gandhi must call newelections by the end of 1989, but despite escalating attacks fromthe political opposition, a viable alternative to the Gandhi dynastyhas yet to emerge.</TEXT><HEAD>AFRICA</HEAD><BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE><DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South Africa's white leaderswere relieved by George Bush's election, and they are apt to usetactics in 1989 that would help him stifle any new sanctionscampaign by Democrats in Congress.   These could include additional releases of political prisoners,softening of some remaining apartheid laws and further diplomaticovertures toward black Africa. The new year could see finalagreement on independence for South-West Africa, also known asNamibia _ another development that would improve South Africa'sstanding in Washington and elsewhere.   In response to such gestures, anti-apartheid leaders in SouthAfrica _ and their allies abroad _ are likely to tell Bush thatcontinued pressure on the government is essential to force it tolift harsh state-of-emergency regulations and grant full politicalrights to the black majority.   The probable settlement in Namibia is to be coupled to withdrawalof Cuban troops from neighboring Angola, where they have been aidingthe Marxist government in a civil war against the UNITA rebelmovement. Bush will have to decide if and when to halt U.S. aid tothe rebels.   Elsewhere in Africa, the new administration will have to wrestlewith a budgetary dilemma _ can it meet its deficit-cuttingpriorities at home and still make an acceptable aid contribution toa continent with staggering development needs?   The Soviet bloc seems to have abandoned expansionist policies onthe continent, and left-leaning governments in countries such asMozambique, Angola and Ethiopia seem more willing than ever to turnto the West for help.</TEXT><HEAD>SOUTH PACIFIC</HEAD><BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE><DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. concerns about Soviet intentions inthe South Pacific will be a major issue facing George Bush'spresidency.   In a landmark speech in Vladivostok in July 1985, Mikhail S.Gorbachev committed the South Union to exerting its influence acrossthe Pacific.   A Soviet military threat seems remote but as one U.S. admiralsaid, ``They have the capability.'' Soviet intentions, added asenior diplomat, are the issue.   Moscow, after winning a string of fishing agreements with smallisland nations and then losing them, is now courting Australia.   The collapse of ANZUS _ the Australia-New Zealand-U.S. militarytreaty _ is no longer an issue. But what is, is the ``whole range ofalliances'' in a part of the world where a nuclear-capable U.S. Navyis not as welcome as it once was.   Other issues likely to cross Bush's desk are those of immediateconcern to the Pacific, such as France's refusal to abandon nucleartesting in the area, its policies in New Caledonia, the future ofAntarctica and the prospect of mining for minerals there. Also,there is the impact of the ``Greenhouse Effect,'' which scientistspredict will swamp some small island nations resulting in a flood of``economic refugees.''   The South Pacific is no longer the lagoon of tranquility it usedto be, as two military coups in Fiji attest. There are issues ofdirect consequence to Australia, and therefore the United States.The Pacific island nations have many of the problems of the ThirdWorld, and for that reason Soviet initiatives are being watched.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sun Jan. 1 or Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
