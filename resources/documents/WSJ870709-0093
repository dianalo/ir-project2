Federal Judge Shirley Wohl Kram denied motions by lawyers for Robert M. Freeman, head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., and Timothy L. Tabor, a former arbitrager at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., for a hearing to determine the sources of a Journal article, and for other relief. She ruled that they failed to make a sufficient showing that such leaks by prosecutors occurred.    Lawyers for Messrs. Freeman and Tabor filed the motions after insider-trading charges against them and former Kidder arbitrage chief Richard B. Wigton were dismissed in May. The government has said it will seek a broader indictment against the three men.    In their applications to the court, the lawyers for Messrs. Freeman and Tabor alleged that prosecutors violated grand jury secrecy requirements in statements in court and to the news media at the time the indictments were dismissed. The lawyers also argued that prosecutors must have been the sources for a May 22 Journal article about the case.    Judge Kram endorsed the prosecutors' courtroom disclosures, noting in a written opinion filed yesterday that they &quot;had a duty to inform the court of the basis for its motions,&quot; which included discussions of matters before the grand jury. As for the Journal article, which identified transactions that might figure in a new indictment against the three men, Judge Kram cited the government's claim that the information &quot;could have been obtained from sources involved in the defense case.&quot;    Howard Wilson, head of the criminal division of the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, said that the motions by lawyers for Messrs. Wigton and Tabor were &quot;entirely frivolous&quot; and that Judge Kram's decision &quot;confirms that the government did absolutely nothing improper.&quot;    Lawyers for Messrs. Freeman and Tabor couldn't be reached. </TEXT></DOC>
