I'm sure there was probably a feelingthat he was possibly finished,&quot; said Raiders Coach Art Shell, then anassistant under Coach Mike Shanahan. &quot;But the guy's shown that he's notfinished. He's phenomenal.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  RAIDERS ADMIT MISTAKE!  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Out of Bounds; The NFL/Week 15  </MEMO><TEXT>     Lofton, 35, in fact, has caught 49 passes for 952 yards and six touchdownsthis season for Buffalo, the Raiders' opponent today in L.A. He is second inthe NFL with a 19.4 yards-per-catch average and is fourth in yardage. Lastseason, when he regained a starring role in the NFL, he averaged 20.3 yards in35 receptions.; SANDERS OR THOMAS?; New York Daily News columnist Gary Myerstook a poll of some NFL coaches, with the question: Who would you rather have,Detroit's Barry Sanders or Buffalo's Thurman Thomas? The vote was split downthe middle. Sanders is the better running back. Thomas is the better receiverand all-around player. Sanders played behind Thomas at Oklahoma State for twoseasons. Even after Thomas left, coaches there were not sure Sanders would bethe starter as a junior. Once they saw him as the featured back, it wasobvious he was a special talent. Detroit does not give Sanders the opportunityto catch the ball in its offensive scheme, but even so, Sanders is not nearlyas skilled a receiver as Thomas.; 2 HARD TO BELIEVE; People in St. Louis areso confident of getting an NFL expansion team that nicknames are beingdiscussed. Possibilities include Archers, Gamblers (bet the commissioner wouldlove that one), Rivermen, Trappers, and, believe it or not, Phoenix. &quot;Youknow, the bird that rose from the ashes,&quot; said Jerry Clinton, a member of theprospective ownership group. Ought to be interesting when St. Louis playsPhoenix. . . . Indianapolis' Jeff George has been sacked 18 times in threegames, in large part thanks to tackle Bubba Paris. Waived by the 49ers in thepreseason, Paris was waived again Monday. &quot;I would be proud to show the other27 teams that game film and hope that they would ask me to make their team,&quot;Paris said.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911208  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  15C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  381  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 8, 199100343110,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
