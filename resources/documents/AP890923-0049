On the eve of their talks, some ministers of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries seemed reluctant to tamper with thecartel's current output accord.   The meeting was to begin today, but there was no indication ofhow long it would last.   Algeria's oil minister, Sadek Boussena, insisted upon arrivingFriday in Geneva, ``There's no need to raise the (production)ceiling as long as the price objective is not met.''   Rilwanu Lukman, president of OPEC, was the last to arrive inGeneva for the opening round of talks later in the day.   Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister, said the price of oil ``coulddo a little bit more.''   ``We would like it to be 18 (dollars a barrel),'' he toldreporters at the hotel where the ministers are staying.   Iraq's oil chief, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, said he favoreda ``reasonable increase'' in the supply cap. He gave no specifics.   The 13-nation cartel agreed in June on a production ceiling of19.5 million barrels a day in the last six months of the year. Itsprice target was set at $18 a 42-gallon barrel.   But analysts say heavy cheating by Kuwait and the United ArabEmirates has helped kick supply up to 22 million barrels a day ormore.   Prices have remained fairly firm, but they are under OPEC'starget.   ``We still have to obtain the goal of $18 ... We should work onit,'' said Ecuador's oil minister, Diego Tamariz.   Shakshuki said, ``Eighteen dollars is better than increasing thequota.''   Prices haven't hit the $18 mark in the past three months.   A basket of seven major crudes monitored by OPEC averaged $17.04a barrel last week. It went above $18 last spring.   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of American oil, hasbeen trading in the range of $19.50 to $20 a barrel.   Fergus MacLeod, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London,predicted prices would slip from 50 cents to $1 a barrel if thecartel increased production without halting members' cheating.   OPEC ministers agreed in June to meet this month and decidewhether to raise their output 500,000 barrels a day in the finalthree months of 1989.   MacLeod said such an increase probably would translate into totalproduction of 22.5 million barrels a day.   The organization's secretary-general, Subroto of Indonesia, saidthat 22 million barrels a day ``looks like the demand for OPEC oilin the fourth quarter'' of the year.   In addition to the supply ceiling, the ministers' agenda includeda discussion of the best way to set their quotas. Each country isassigned a daily quota.   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates want bigger shares as do someother nations. To press their demands, the two countries have beenpumping as much as double their daily quotas of about a millionbarrels each, analysts say.   Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, told reportersthat his pledge in June to rein in production had been``conditional.''   ``If everybody sticks to the quota, fine. If anybody breaks it,the others have the same right,'' he said.   The talks will officially be held by an OPEC monitoring panelmade up of Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, SaudiArabia and Venezuela.   The cartel other members _ Gabon, Ecuador, Libya, Qatar and theUnited Arab Emirates _ also were invited to attend.</TEXT></DOC>
