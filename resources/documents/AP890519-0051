President Mengistu Haile Mariam told the nation on radio andtelevision late Thursday that the situation in the northernmostprovince of Eritrea was ``under full control.''   But diplomatic sources in the capital said loyal and dissidentunits of Ethiopia's 2nd Army clashed today in and around theprovincial capital of Asmara, three days after the mutiny began.   ``It is not under control,'' said one Western diplomat.``Obviously, the whole situation is very fluid.''   The revolt is the most serious challenge to Mengistu's 15-yearrule in Ethiopia, which is the Soviet Union's closest ally inAfrica.   The diplomat, who like his colleagues spoke only on conditionthat he not be identified, said at least six rebellious generalswere killed in the factional fighting, including the 2nd Army'scommander.   ``I think Mengistu may be getting it in hand,'' he said, ``but Idon't think he's quite as firmly back in the saddle as hisstatement last night would indicate.''   The 150,000-strong 2nd Army, nearly half the country's entirearmed forces, had been considered in full opposition to Mengistu.Thursday's fighting between rival factions within the unitrepresented what the diplomat called ``a dramatic turn.''   ``It's pretty obvious now that while the insurgents held Asmara,they did not fully control units outside the (provincial)capital,'' the diplomat said.   He said the counterrevolt was led by the 102 Paratroop Brigade,the 3rd Mechanized Brigade and the 2nd Tank Brigade, all unitsbased in other Eritrean cities.   An African diplomat in Addis Ababa said other army units basedoutside the capital had been outwardly neutral in the revolt butnow appeared to be swinging toward the government.   In his first public comment since returning Wednesday from anabbreviated trip to East Germany, Mengistu blamed the uprising on``a few generals'' who placed their ``greed and hunger for power''above the national interest.   He said Thursday that his ``revolutionary forces willliquidate'' the mutineers.   A few hours before the report of fighting within the 2nd Army,the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) declared it wastemporarily suspending its 28-year war of secession to support therebellious soldiers.   The Western diplomat said the factional fighting appeared tohave been caused by ``a backlash against the rapprochement with theEPLF.''   The rebels control three-fourths of the countryside in Eritrea,and the army generally is confined to garrisons in the cities,including Asmara.   Mengistu inherited the northern civil war when he and a cliqueof army officers deposed Emperor Haile Selassie on Sept. 12, 1974.   Eritrea is a former Italian colony that was federated withEthiopia in 1957 under a U.S.-sponsored U.N. resolution. HaileSelassie annexed the territory in 1962.</TEXT></DOC>
