KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Over the last two centuries there have been10,393 attempts to amend the U.S. Constitution and only 26 successes.   President Bush isn't bothered by those odds as he presses for anamendment to protect the Stars and Stripes from destruction bypolitical protesters.   The president says he's outraged over the Supreme Court'sdecision permitting flag burning as an acceptable, if unattractive,expression of the free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.   Bush wants a 27th amendment permitting Congress and the states topass laws banning the ``desecration'' of Old Glory.   A check of the records shows that more attempts are being madenow than ever before to change the Constitution, with actual changesjust as infrequent as ever.   No change has been made since the 26th amendment giving18-year-olds the vote was ratified 18 years ago.   In the first hundred years _ 1789-1889 _ 1,736 proposedamendments to the Constitution were filed with Congress.   From 1963 until the House adjourned last Thursday, 5,001amendments have been offered.   Those figures include, of course, multiple submissions of thesame ideas and repeat filings, Congress after Congress afterCongress.   About two dozen resolutions have been filed in the House andSenate to forbid flag desecration since the Supreme Court handeddown its decision on June 21.   Such an amendment would have to be approved by the House andSenate by two-thirds majorities. The amendment would be ratified andmade part of the Constitution only with the approval ofthree-fourths of the 50 states.   The difficulty of hurdling the barriers erected by theConstitution's authors have not kept people from trying.   Former President Reagan campaigned for eight years for anamendment to require a balanced federal budget. As a privatecitizen, he is campaigning still.   Reagan also wanted an amendment allowing a president to line-itemveto individual sections of appropriations bills instead of dealingwith them on an all-or-nothing basis. He didn't get that either, atleast not yet.   President Bush now has endorsed four amendments to theConstitution: Flag desecration, anti-abortion, balanced budget andline-item veto.   The Equal Rights Amendment forbidding discrimination based on sexwas first introduced in 1923. Congress finally approved it in 1972and sent it to the states for ratification. Its highwater mark todate came in 1982 when the number of states voting to ratify reached35, three states short of the required 38.   Proposed amendments are pending in various forms to ban busing toachieve racial balance in schools, to set a single six-year term forthe president, to set terms for House members at four years, toforbid abortion, to make the District of Columbia the 51st state, tomake English the official language of the United States, and topermit prayer in public schools.   Other ideas floated over the last 20 years or so include:Requiring a three-fifths vote for Congress to borrow money,requiring a two-thirds vote to approve appropriations and budgets,abolishing the income tax and limiting congressional immunity fortraffic offenses.   Until now, the hurdles have proven too steep for all of the above.   But one of the earliest proposed amendments _ it appeared to havedied on the vine early in the 19th Century _ is showing new signs oflife because of 20th Century controversy over congressional payraises.   Drafted by James Madison and submitted to the First Congress, itstates: ``No law varying the compensation for the service of thesenators and representatives shall take effect until an election ofrepresentatives shall have intervened.''   Its effect would be to give the voters a chance to retaliatebefore a legislative pay raise takes effect.   Congress approved the proposition on Sept. 25, 1789, and sent itto the states. Only six states voted to ratify, until a drive begana few years ago to breathe new life into it.   In recent years five additional states have voted to ratify it.That brings the total after two centuries to 11 and holds out atleast a slim chance that Madison's idea may someday become a part ofthe Constitution.</TEXT></DOC>
