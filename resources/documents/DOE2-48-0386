Production from several zones within the Paleozoicsection has been established both in basins and shelf edges of the surroundingarea. A thick sequence of volcanic rocks covers the platform in JeffDavis County, Texas. These rocks effectively prevent seismic investigationof the presumed sedimentary section below. Gravity, magnetic, and sparsewell data were used in constructing an initial geologic model. A magnetotelluricsurvey consisting of 18 sites showed shallow resistive anomalies in agreementwith magnetic anomalies. The magnetotelluric field data were modeledusing the initial geologic model. From well control data, resistivityvalues for the volcanic rocks, sediments, and basement were set. Aftersuccessive geophysical modeling, a final geologic model was constructed,which is reconciled with the magnetotelluric, magnetic, and well controldata. A possible reef is present on the northeast side of the platform.</TEXT></DOC>
