Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the national service legislation heand Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., introduced in January is notintended to make civilian service more attactive than militaryservice.   He said proposed incentives might have to be adjusted to ensurethat military service remains the most attractive option, but thenet effect of the bill would be an overall increase in young peoplewilling to serve their country.   ``If you create a huge increase in the pool of people who want toserve, either in civilian or military service, it is my firm beliefthat you're going to have more people going into the military, notless,'' he said.   During a news conference called to announce the U.S. Jaycees'endorsement of the national service proposal, Nunn and McCurdyresponded to criticism of their bill.   Robbie Dawkins, national vice president of the group which has240,000 members aged 21 to 39, said such voluntary national servicewould ``promote a new spirit of citizenship and commitment.''   Under the legislation, young people who serve two years in themilitary would get $24,000 for college or vocational school or forbuying a house. Two years of civilian service would net $20,000 ineducation or housing aid. It would make national service arequirement for young people to qualify for federal college loansand grants.   Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., a senior member of the HouseArmed Services Committee and chairman of the House Veterans AffairsCommittee, said last week he opposes the idea because it would drawhigh-quality people away from the military by paying them forcommunity service.   Similar complaints were voiced to a House Armed Servicessubcommittee last week by Grant S. Green, the Pentagon's manpowerchief. He said the bill's ``lucrative alternatives for civilianservice or shorter enlistments'' would ``reduce recruit quality,increase training costs and adversely affect the productivity ofmilitary personnel.''   Montgomery said armed services would be forced to accept two-yearvolunteers whether they need them or not. He also said the bill'sincentives would undermine the GI Bill, which provides $10,800 ineducation aid after three years of military service.   McCurdy, however, said the plan would enhance the GI Bill byproviding vocational school or housing benefits to young people whoserve but don't want to go to college. The existing GI bill, hesaid, offers nothing to such people.   ``The bottom line is we want to keep having the military be themost attractive option,'' Nunn said.</TEXT></DOC>
