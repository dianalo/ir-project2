Field of The Invention </PAR><PAR>  This invention is directed to the use of alkali metal      N-halo-alkanesulfonamides as bleaching agents for removing stains from      non-white stained materials. </PAR><PAR>  2. Brief Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  Many bleaches which efficiently and effectively remove stains from      non-white goods such as fabrics, most often damage the color by attacking      the dyes used in these goods. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 3,707,554 describes alkali metal N-halo-alkanesulfonamides      having bleaching and antiseptic properties and capable of being formulated      in bleaching and detergent compositions and represented by the following      formula:      ##STR1##      wherein X is chlorine or bromine, M is an alkali metal, and R is an alkyl      having from 1 to about 22 carbon atoms. These compounds are prepared by      reacting an alkanesulfonamide with an alkali metal hypochlorite or      hypobromite. The patent additionally states that the compounds may be      prepared by reacting an alkanesulfonamide with an alkali metal hydroxide      and hypochlorous or hypobromous acid and the resulting alkali metal      N-halo-alkanesulfonamide thereafter recovered. </PAR><PAR>  The patent also states that the N-halo compounds are especially suitable      for use in granular detergent compositions, in particular in heavy duty      granular detergent compositions. In column 6 of the patent, a formulation      is set forth containing the N-halo compound. The patent then states that      the product is suitable for washing soiled white goods, e.g., table linen      and bed linen at normal washing machine temperatures. This patent does not      disclose the use of the alkali metal N-halo-alkanesulfonamides to remove      stains from non-white materials. </PAR><PAC>  BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention is directed to the use of alkali metal      N-halo-alkanesulfonamides as bleaching agents for non-white goods,      particularly fabrics. It has been found that the alkali metal      N-halo-alkanesulfonamides remove stains from non-white materials,      particularly fabrics without affecting the color of the materials. </PAR><PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  In the present invention, alkali metal N-halo-alkanesulfonamides are used      as bleaching agents to remove stains from non-white materials. </PAR><PAR>  The alkali metal N-halo-alkanesulfonamides can be used as bleaching agents      for non-white materials such as fabrics and cloths which can be made into      a variety of end uses. The alkali metal N-halo-alkanesulfonamides are of      the following formula:      ##STR2##      wherein R is an alkyl of 1 to about 25 carbon atoms, preferably from 10 to      25 carbon atoms, M is an alkali metal, preferably sodium and potassium and      X is chlorine or bromine. </PAR><PAR>  The non-white materials are treated with the alkali metal      N-halo-alkanesulfonamide for a time and at a temperature sufficient to      remove any stains therefrom. This is generally at a temperature of from      about 5 to about 80 .degree. C. and for a period of time sufficient to      remove any stains. </PAR><PAR>  The alkali metal N-halo-alkanesulfonamide may be prepared by any of the      methods set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 3,707,554, discussed above. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the N-halo compounds are prepared by reacting the      alkanesulfonamide and one equivalent of alkali metal hydroxide and then      adding one equivalent of a substantially pure sodium hypochlorite and      thereafter recovering the resulting alkali metal N-halo-alkanesulfonamide.      The substantially pure sodium hypochlorite is made from sodium hydroxide      and the substantially pure hypochlorous acid prepared as described below.      The reaction temperature is generally from about 25.degree. to about      100.degree. C. </PAR><PAR>  The hypochlorous acid used in the instant process may be characterized as a      solution containing greater than 5% by weight of hypochlorous acid,      preferably from about 25 to about 60%, and most preferably from about 30      to about 50% by weight of hypochlorous acid. The hypochlorous acid      solution is substantially free of chloride, chlorate, and alkali metal      ions. </PAR><PAR>  The concentrated hypochlorous acid solution may be produced from a gaseous      mixture comprised of chlorine monoxide, hypochlorous acid vapor, chlorine,      and water vapor, which process comprises condensing the gaseous mixture at      a temperature in the range of from about -5.degree. C. to about      andplus;10.degree. C. </PAR><PAR>  In more detail, the process for producing the concentrated hypochlorous      acid solution comprises reacting an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide, such      as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or lithium hydroxide in droplet      form with chlorine gas. The reaction is conducted at temperatures      sufficiently high enough to vaporize hypochlorous acid as it is produced      and separate it from solid particles of alkali metal chloride which are      also formed in the reaction. As gaseous mixtures having high      concentrations of hypochlorous acid and chlorine monoxide are desired,      highly concentrated aqueous solutions of the alkali metal hydroxide are      used. Suitable concentrations include those in the range of from about 40      to about 80%, and preferably from about 45 to about 60% by weight of      alkali metal hydroxide. A stoichiometric excess of chlorine above that      required to form hypochlorous acid with all of the alkali metal hydroxide      is used, for example from about 1 to about 20, and preferably from about 5      to about 10 times the stoichiometric proportion of chlorine is employed.      Solid particles of alkali metal chloride are also produced during the      reaction which have a wide range of particles sizes. </PAR><PAR>  The gaseous mixture comprised of hypochlorous acid vapor, chlorine      monoxide, chlorine, and water vapor used in the process contains high      concentrations of HOCl and Cl.sub.2 O. The chlorine monoxide is formed by      the conversion of HOCl vapors during the vaporization process according to      the equation: </PAR><EQU>  2HOCl.revreaction.Cl.sub.2 Oandplus;H.sub.2 O                     (1) </EQU><PAR>  The gaseous mixture also contains fine particles of the alkali metal      chloride which are entrained. The solid particles may be removed by any      suitable separation means, for example, by passing the gaseous mixture      through a gas filter medium or through a solid separator such as a      cyclone. </PAR><PAR>  The gaseous mixture, now free of solids, is fed to a condenser. The      condenser is operated at temperatures which produce concentrated aqueous      solutions of hypochlorous acid without condensing undesirable amounts of      chlorine or liquid chlorine monoxide. Suitable temperatures for operating      the condensation process include those in the range of from about      -5.degree. C. to about andplus;20.degree. C. </PAR><PAR>  The uncondensed gaseous mixture recovered from the condenser is      substantially anhydrous as the water vapor originally present was      condensed to form the aqueous hypochlorous acid solution. While the      hypochlorous acid concentration is significantly reduced, the chlorine gas      concentration is substantially the same as that in the original gaseous      mixture fed to the condenser. </PAR><PAR>  The concentrated hypochlorous acid solution is highly pure. The dissolved      chlorine concentration in the hypochlorous acid solution of the present      invention is less than about 2% by weight. The concentrated hypochlorous      acid solution is essentially free of ionic impurities such as alkali      metal, chloride, and chlorate ions. Concentrations of the chloride ion are      less than about 50 parts per million; the alkali metal ion concentration      is less than about 50 parts per million; and the chlorate ion      concentration is no more than about 100 parts per million. </PAR><PAR>  A process for producing hypochlorous acid is described in, for example,      U.S. Pat. No. 4,146,578, incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. </PAR><PAR>  The alkali metal N-halo-alkanesulfonamides of this invention may be      combined with other materials to be formulated into detergents and the      like. </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAC>  EXAMPLES </PAC><PAR>  The following examples illustrate the process of this invention and are      presented without the intention of being limited thereby: </PAR><PAC>  Preparation of Hypochlorous Acid Solution </PAC><PAR>  The following represents a typical process for the preparation of a      concentrated hypochlorous acid solution useful in this invention: </PAR><PAR>  A gaseous mixture containing an average concentration of 180.7 parts by      weight of chlorine monoxide, 384.5 parts by weight of Cl.sub.2, and 60.3      parts by weight of water vapor was continuously passed through a cyclone      separator to remove any entrained solid particles of alkali metal      chloride. The solid-free gaseous mixture at a temperature of 85-90.degree.      C. was passed through a vertical shell and tube heat exchanger maintained      at a temperature of about 0.degree. C. and a pressure of about 3-4 torr      gauge to condense a portion of the chlorine monoxide and substantially all      of the water vapor to produce an aqueous hypochlorous acid solution      containing 45 to 50% by weight of HOCl. The hypochlorous acid solution had      a pH of about 1 and the dissolved chlorine concentration was determined to      be about 1% by weight. An uncondensed gas mixture containing an average of      141.9 parts by weight of Cl.sub.2 O, 384.1parts by weight of Cl.sub.2 and      0.5 parts by weight of water was continuously removed from the condenser.      The uncondensed gas mixture was passed through a heat exchanger to raise      the temperature to about 100.degree. C. and recycled to a generator used      to produce the gaseous mixture of chlorine monoxide. </PAR><PAC>  Preparation of N-Chloro-N-Sodiododecanesulfonamide </PAC><PAR>  A mixture of 12.0 grams (0.048 m) dodecylsulfonamide and 48 ml of a 1.0 N      aqueous solution (0.048 m) of NaOH were stirred and heated at      90-100.degree. C. for four minutes, then cooled to 50.degree. C. To this      solution was added at 50.degree. C. and over a 30 sec. period 120 ml of a      3% aqueous solution (0.048 m) of sodium hypochlorite. This clear solution      was stirred for 10 mins. at 50.degree. C., then allowed to cool slowly to      25.degree. C. without stirring. The crystals which formed on cooling were      removed by filtration and recrystallized from 0.1 N NaOH to give 13 g. of      the product N-chloro-N-sodiododecanesulfonamide. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLES 1 to 4 </PAC><PAR>  The dye attack test was conducted as stated in the following method with      one exception. The same N-chloro-N-sodiododecanesulfonamide/commercial      high phosphate detergent was blended 4 parts detergent to 1 part bleach.      The N-chloro-N-sodiododecanesulfonamide containing samples show only minor      changes in reflectance (no dye attack) compared to dry chlorine bleach. </PAR><PAC>  Fabric Pretreatment </PAC><PA0>  1. Wash fabric in household clothes washer in warm water using one cup      commercial high phosphate detergent or equivalent. </PA0><PA0>  2. Cut fabric into 6&quot;.times.6&quot; swatches. </PA0><PA0>  3. Measure color using Hunter ColorQuest Spectrophotometer or equivalent      measure CIE L*a*b* scale using D65 illumenent and 10.degree. observer      angle (measure color with and without the Presence of UV light). </PA0><PAC>  Test Procedure </PAC><PA0>  1. Weigh 1 gram available chlorine equivalent of bleach. For example, a 50%      blend of CDB.RTM. Clearon contains 28% available chlorine. 1 gram      available chlorine equivalent of the bleach would be 1/.28andequals;3.57 grams of      bleach. </PA0><PA0>  2. Place bleach in the center of one swatch (dye side up) and mark as      bottom. Smooth bound of bleach into approximate 2&quot; circle. </PA0><PA0>  3. Place second swatch (dye side down) on top of first swatch and bleach      sample fold corners upward and over forming a pouch. Mark second swatch as      top. </PA0><PA0>  4. Dissolve 3 grams of detergent in 600 ml of 40.degree. C. water. </PA0><PA0>  5. Place bleach pouch in detergent solution with first swatch against the      bottom of the beaker. Weigh pouch down with spatula. </PA0><PA0>  6. Time for 90 seconds and remove swatch from detergent solution. Rinse off      excess bleach and allow to air dry. Dispose of detergent-bleach solution. </PA0><PA0>  7. After swatch(s) are dry, iron and measure color change using Hunter      ColorQuest Spectrophotometer or equivalent. Measure CIE L*a*b* scale using      D65 illumenent and 10.degree. observer angle (measure with and without UV      light). </PA0><PAR>  In Table 1, the results demonstrate that in cold water the      N-chlor-N-sodiododecanesulfonamide bleach removed 80-90% of tea stain      applied to 100% cotton fabric. As a comparison detergent alone removes      about 20% and CDB.RTM. Clearon about 100%. </PAR><PAR>  In Table 2, N-chlor-N-sodiododecanesulfonamide bleach was used in a denim      dye attack test. No dye damage was noticed with either the bleach alone      applied to the denim fabric or the block blended with the commercial high      phosphate detergent then applied to the denim fabric. Chlorine dry bleach      attacks the denim dye. </PAR><PAR>  While the invention has been described above with reference to specific      embodiments thereof, it is apparent that many changes, modifications, and      variations can be made without departing from the inventive concept      disclosed herein.
