A VGA demo diskette a dealer gave mewhen I purchased mY VGA monitor.andP;  I've recovered from a week or two of traumaand a few thousand dollars in lost productivity.andP;  McMee's program saved meand turned me into a believer.andP;  I don't wish you any bad luck, but should yousuffer from such a calamity, You'll understand how serious viruses are.andM;Herb WahlandM;Forksville, PennsylvaniaandM;One month after reading John McAfee's book Computer Viruses, Worms, DataDiddlers, Killer Programs, and Other Threats to Your System I bought a $2PrOgram (similar to those advertised in your magazine).andP;  It ran strangely, soI erased it.andP;  McAfee's book helped me to realize that my PC had received avirus from the disk and showed me how to eradicate it.andP;  And even if PamelaKane's book is poorly written, the software that comes with it is a bargain.andM;Robert E. GrossandM;Kettering, OhioandM;When I upgraded my old XT to a 386, some but not all of my programs wouldrun.andP;  I spent hours trying to figure out the problem.andP;  Finally, the companythat sold me the machine suggested the possibility of a virus.andP;  Sure enough,the machine had come with a virus installed on its 70MB hard drive, which hadsome VGA drivers and test software on it for my use.andP;  McMee's product helpedme scan and &quot;cure&quot; my machine.andP;  Ray's claim that users are being manipulatedby a handful of Strangelovian alarmists, and that viruses pose no real threatto users, is simply false..andM;Kenneth C. ReedandM;Durham, CaliforniaandM;Swapping Your CONFIG.SYSandM;There's a better way to switch CONFIG.SYS files than the method explained inFebruary's Startup Hot Tip.andP;  A shareware program called CONFIG.CTL (availableon CompuServe, PCMagnet, and other BBSs) lets you keep all your devicedrivers in the same CONFIG.SYS file.andP;  But when you boot your system, itpauses to let you change the size of the RAMdisk, for example, or to disablea device driver completely while leaving the others enabled.andM;Douglas K. JardineandM;Sechelt, British ColumbiaandM;Dangerous MagnetismandM;Ron White suggests that &quot;Magnets on swivel heads attached to telescoping armscan also be used to retrieve some metallic objects&quot; (&quot;Tools of the Trade,&quot;Home Office, February).andP;  Someone who would recommend sticking a magnetanywhere inside a computer case shouldn't be allowed in the same room with aPC.andM;Pat CrossandM;El Paso, TexasandM;The weak  magnets an pickup arms are not likely to harm any computercomponent, even EPROMS, which are succeptible to magnetism But it is truethat many pC OPeratOrs forbid magnets anywhere near components as a matter ofpolicy.-EdandM;Buying Beta UnawaresandM;In mid-January, I discovered that I had unexpectedly bought a &quot;headstart&quot;version of TurboTax.andP;  Silly me! I thought I was buying a tax package to filemy taxes.andP;  But ChipSoft clearly states-inside the box, of course-that Ishouldn't use the program to file my actual taxes.andP;  The company, I was told,would send me the &quot;final edition&quot; as soon as it was complete.andM;Five weeks later, after spending hours trying to reach ChipSoft through allthree of its listed numbers (constantly busy), I finally received my update.andO;My dealer had so many complaints with the package that he no longer carriesit.andP;  Caveat emptor !andP;  Larry BloomandM;Clearwater, FloridaandM;AST's Full 486 PowerandM;The March review of the AST Premium 486/25 (&quot;Speed Demons: The New Fast486s&quot;) is grossly inaccurate.andP;  Your assertion that AST slaps &quot;a 486 chip intowhat's basically a 286 machine&quot; is far from the truth.andM;AST's Cupid-32 is designed for 32-bit 386 and i486 architectures; it supportsfull 32-bit memory, address bus, and i486 burst mode.andP;  The article alsostates that the machine cannot use expansion boards developed for the 32-bitMicro Channel.andP;  This is because AST was one of the founders of EISA.andP;  It wasnever Our intention to build an MCA PC.andP;  Instead, users can buy our ISA-basedi486 machine with the option of upgrading to EISA tomorrow.andM;Eric LeppanenandM;AST Research Inc.andM;Irvine, CaliforniaandM;Zippity Doo-DahandM;&quot;Zippity PKzip&quot;  (February) was a long overdue tribute to a fantasticcompression utility.andP;  But the article that followed, &quot;Six Who Shared,&quot; shouldhave included Phil Katz, who wrote PKzip.andP;  You missed an opportunity to&quot;share&quot; a great shareware story-Phil Katz's troubles with SEA and how PKzipbecame the son of PKarc.andM;Your description of Arc 6.02 as having &quot;deteriorated into amiddle-of-the-road performer&quot; tells me that there's still some justice in theworld.andM;Dick CullenandM;Falls Church, VirginiaandM;Congratulations on another fine issue, especially Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols'sarticle on PKzip-undoubtedly the best archive program available.andP;  He made onesmall error, however.andP;  You must use the -d command with PKunzip if you wantit to recreate your original paths.andP;  Otherwise, PKunzip will decompress allthe specified files to the current path.andM;Bruce WhiteandM;Manhattan, KansasandM;I have found the arcane DOS commands in all archiving programs inconvenientand hard to remember.andP;  To circumvent them, I use a shareware program calledArcMaster, from NewWare.andP;  It's a full-featured, menu-driven interface thatsupports six popular and widely used systems, including PKzip.andM;Phillip A. GrebandM;Austin, TexasandM;New-Ware can be reached at 8050 Camino Kiosco, San Diego, Calif.andP;  921221820;619-455-6225.-Ed.andM;Five More MacrosandM;I found  1-2-3 Macros You Can't Do Without&quot; (March) to be very useful.andP;  Hereare five more:andM;\1 /WIR (to insert a row)andM;\R /RNC (to create a range name)andM;\L /RNLR (to create a label)andM;\H /WCH (to hide a column)andM;\D /WCD  to display a column)andM;Claude SturgeonandM;Rockwall, TexasandM;Technological UnderclassandM;George Gilder's vision of the digital &quot;telecomputer&quot; replacing analog TV isimpressive (&quot;Television Is Dead,&quot; February).andP;  But I wonder what kind ofthought he has given to the social implications of this gee-whiz technology.andM;Gilder wants the government to further restrict access to the airwaves andinstead run fiber optics into our homes-more easily done in Tyringham,Massachusetts, than in poor urban or rural areas.andP;  Even his optimisticestimates place this technology beyond the reach of lower-class andworking-class families.andM;His anti-Japan argument overlooks the realities of our global economy.andP;  Andthe &quot;digital village&quot; he describes ignores the poorer Third World&quot;neighborhoods&quot;-except as scenic places to visit electronically, where youdon't have to drink the water.andM;Surely there are socially beneficial uses to which we should instead devoteour technological resources.andP;  Aren't causes such as quality education andenvironmental protection a little more important than viewer-programmedfootball coverage and electronically enhanced real estate showings?andM;Todd VerBeekandM;Holland, MichiganandM;A Map of the FutureandM;Congratulations to Kate McKeown's article, &quot;Everyone Can Be a Leader&quot;(January).andP;  Don Steinberg's piece, &quot;The Wildly Successful IBM Portable andOther Miscalls of the 1980s&quot; (New!, January), however, downgrades the actualachievements of the PC revolution: &quot;It seems the forecasts of the last decadedidn't come true.&quot;andM;The PC media must get away from such micro comments.andP;  All businesses are nowracing to exploit the fact that 386- and 486-based machines teamed with OS/2deliver-for less than the cost of leasing a car for a year-the power that a$3.5 million IBM 370 mainframe delivered in the 1970s.andM;Give Steinberg a 486 PC with OS/2 and a lead time of 100 days.andP;  Perhaps thenhe'll discover McKeown's map of the future.andP;  He might be amazed.andM;Keith W KingslandandM;Don Mills, OntarioandM;The Network Police StateandM;John Dvorak hit the nail squarely on the head with his synopsis of networking(Seymour vs.andP;  Dvorak, March).andP;  It's an unfortunate commentary on Americanbusiness that a small band of power-hungry MIS managers can have so muchinfluence over the way individuals use their own computers.andP;  This is the samegroup that dismissed PCs as a mere fad until the technology nearly rolledright over them.andP;  Yet, as much as they may be smarting over their lack ofvision, they refuse to learn from their mistakes.andP;  In too many firms, the MISdepartment is a stifled bureaucracy bent on control that ignores its charterto serve.andP;  In too many situations, networking is just a means to that end.andM;Roger MadisonandM;Fremont, CaliforniaandM;Turbocharged Spell-CheckingandM;In &quot;Software for the Road&quot; (March), Doug van Kirk observed that&quot;spell-checking from diskette is about as responsive as a Chrysler Imperialwith Dyna-ride and cruise control.&quot; While I'm sure this is true of most wordprocessors, the spell-checker in XyWrite III Plus is entirely RAM-residentand is consequently faster than a turbo-charged Porsche.andM;Like any good sports car, it's also compact.andP;  You can lop 22K off the totaldisk space by removing the SPELL.OVR file from the program.andM;Judith A. MintzandM;XyQuest, Inc.andM;Billerica, MassachusettsandM;Actually, XyWrite loads the spelling program into memory but leaves thedictionary on disk until it's needed At that point, it loads as much of thedictionary into RAM as possible.- Ed.andM;Government Prose Made WorseandM;Steven Frankel's letter to the editor (February) about your review ofReadability Plus, the grammar checker his company makes, was pure sniveling.andO;The product ought to be called Readability Minus.andP;  The Department of Defenseasked my company to select a good grammar checker for a major project it wasworking on.andM;When I used Readability Plus on a government document, it turned it intounreadable garbage.andP;  It was the only grammar checker to make governmentwriting worse-something I didn't think was possible.andP;  Frankel must think thatthe marketplace is a beta test site.andM;Don E GardonandM;State College, PennsylvaniaandM;Send your thoughts to Letters PC/Computing, Four Cambridge Center, Cambridge,Mass.andP;  021 42; fax us at 617-497-2578, or contact us via MCI Mail atPCCOMPUTING.andP;  Letters must be signed and must include a daytime phone number.andO;They become the property of PC/ Computing and will be edited for length andclarity.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
