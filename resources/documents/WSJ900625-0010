British Petroleum Co.'s U.S. unit, Carborundum Co., saysit will start shipping samples of ceramic casings by the endof the year, aiming at &quot;a significant&quot; portion of the $1.5billion annual market.</LP><TEXT>   In the next two years, the company says it plans to build&quot;at least two&quot; full-scale production plants. It also istrying to forge strategic alliances with major computer andelectronics makers. &quot;We're very aware what we have to face upto,&quot; says Gerald Miller, director of technology and businessdevelopment for Carborundum's new microelectronics division.   Potential customers see Carborundum's entry assignificant. Steve Hansen, a technology manager at DigitalEquipment Corp., says having local suppliers would mean&quot;getting technology sooner&quot; and having some influence on it.&quot;The Japanese don't tend to share the latest technology,&quot; hesays.   Ceramics have been gaining wide applications, replacingplastic casings, but their inherent brittleness makes themtricky to produce for sophisticated applications. Thedifficulties are compounded by exacting standards forelectronic packaging, the casing that both insulates a chipand connects it to an electronic system through an array ofminute pins.   The world-wide market is dominated by Japan's KyoceraCorp., with an estimated 63% share, according to WillStrauss, president of Forward Concepts Co., amicroelectronics consultant. N.G.K. Spark Plug Co. has 18% ofthe market, followed by Narumi Seito Ltd. at 9%, and ShinkoElectric Industries Ltd. at 3%, according to Mr. Strauss. Alltold, he says, the Japanese account for 94% of the world-widemarket. &quot;The prospect of an American company knocking theJapanese is nil,&quot; says Mr. Strauss. &quot;I don't think it's goingto happen in this lifetime.&quot;   Neither the pessimism of Mr. Strauss and others nor therecent experience of Aluminum Co. of America, which isfloundering in the business, has deterred Carborundum frombuilding a design and engineering facility in Phoenix.   Alcoa got into the business two years ago, hoping to cashin on its knowledge of alumina, the powdery intermediateproduct in the making of aluminum that is also the basic rawmaterial for ceramics.   The aluminum maker has invested more than $70 million in aSan Diego plant to turn that powder into advanced chipcasings. But months into the project, Alcoa replaced some topmanagers and technicians at the plant with formerInternational Business Machine Corp. engineers. &quot;Werecognized that we needed higher skills,&quot; says KennethBlevins, president of Alcoa's electronic packaging division.   Mr. Blevins acknowledges that the plant is behind schedulein shipment and is still &quot;going through learning curves&quot; asit tries to reduce product defects. He declines to discussAlcoa's specific problems at the plant, but acknowledges thattechnology for making ceramic chip casings turned out to bequite different from the company's expertise in alumina.   Others before Alcoa had difficulties. Last year, GeneralElectric Co. sold its ceramics-packaging plant inChattanooga, Tenn., to Coors Ceramics Co., a unit of AdolphCoors Co. GE had acquired the plant from 3M Corp., which inturn had acquired the facility from American Lava Co. &quot;No onehas been able to make a go of that plant,&quot; says Mr. Strauss.&quot;It will produce one perfect batch, and the next batch willbe out of tolerance and other specifications.&quot; He adds, &quot;Atone time, it {the plant} was one big hope for America tocompete against the Japanese.&quot;   Researchers say the technology to form and mold ceramicsinto sophisticated products, such as silicon casing, is asmuch a &quot;black art&quot; as science. The grain of the powder, the&quot;binding&quot; solution to hold it all together, the bakingtemperature and pressing techniques all influence the finalproduct. A minute flaw can cause a crack. &quot;It's difficult forany processing plant to control all this,&quot; says PeterLagerlof, a specialist on ceramics at Case Western ReserveUniversity, where Kyocera has endowed a chair for the studyof ceramics. &quot;Even the furnace design affects the product,&quot;he adds.   Mr. Lagerlof says that the Japanese, who have been at itmuch longer, have managed to achieve that perfect set ofcombinations where &quot;they have {fewer} flaws&quot; in the finalproduct. These process details are &quot;trade secrets,&quot; he says.   In ceramics packaging, a particularly challenging problemhas been controlling the shrinkage rate in the final bakingprocess. The ceramic must be precisely shaped and patternedbefore it's vitrified by heat, which shrinks it. &quot;You findvariation from package to package. When you are dealing withvery fine geometry, the {tendency for ceramics to shrink}introduces a lot of complications,&quot; says Digital's Mr.Hansen. He adds that as chips get smaller and faster, theywill put even &quot;greater demands&quot; on ceramic casings.   Carborundum's Mr. Miller says his company will overcomemost of the common problems, drawing upon its &quot;100 years&quot; ofexperience in working with ceramic materials. The NiagaraFalls, N.Y., company makes structural ceramics forrefractories, gas-ignition systems and other industrial uses.   To start with, he says, the company will use aluminumnitride as the basic material, instead of alumina, which isthe current standard among the Japanese. Mr. Miller saidaluminum nitride has &quot;certain key properties&quot; thatCarborundum will exploit. The material's expansion andcontraction, for instance, matches that of the silicon chipand dissipates heat better than alumina. Moreover, he says,the company has developed &quot;a proprietary&quot; knowledge of how totweak the sintering and pressing process to &quot;get the precisecombination&quot; of factors to make the perfect piece of ceramicpackaging.</TEXT></DOC>
