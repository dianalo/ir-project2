GaryDaniels.andP;  The new CPU16 16-bit execution unit on the IMB is themost important module on the unit; it is a scaled-down, sped-upversion of the CPU32 core in the 68300 series.andP;  Two main 16-bitaccumulators are used in place of the single pair of concatenated8-bit accumulators in the HC11; there are more index registers,and all have 4-bit bank registers.andP;  The ROMless Z1 version costs$25 in 1,000s.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Motorola Inc.
