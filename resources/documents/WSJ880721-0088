The suppliers-St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Airbus Industrie, a European consortium based in Toulouse, France-conceded that deliveries were late.    Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR said net was $141.4 million, or $2.36 a share, compared with $92.2 million, or $1.51 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 18% to $2.16 billion from $1.83 billion.    In the first half, net rose 87% to $209.8 million, or $3.49 a share, from $112.1 million, or $1.88 a share, a year earlier. Revenue was $4.13 billion, up 24% from $3.34 billion.    Factors in the strong showing were generally strong traffic across the airline industry, some fare increases and expanded seating capacity at AMR.    &quot;As pleased as we are with the results,&quot; Robert L. Crandall, AMR's chairman and president said, &quot;we are disappointed by the performance of our aircraft suppliers.&quot;    McDonnell Douglas blamed the delivery delays on lingering effects of its 1987 labor squabbles and rapid growth in the airline industry that resulted in increases in the company's production over the past two years. Those increases, the aircraft builder said, weren't matched by the increases in its trained personnel or parts production. McDonnell Douglas said it has an order backlog of more than 600 of its MD-80 aircraft.    AMR said it is now scheduled to receive 33 of the MD-80s this year instead of the 42 it had expected. Industry sources said the planes cost $22 million to $27 million each.    A U.S. spokesman for Airbus said it was late in delivery of the second and third of 13 wide-body planes scheduled to be delivered to AMR this year.    The spokesman said Airbus's efforts to deliver the first of its new A320 aircraft to another buyer in March delayed delivery of its A300-600R planes to AMR by two to three weeks. AMR is scheduled to receive 12 of the aircraft next year. Airbus said it doesn't anticipate any further delivery delays on the 267-passenger aircraft.    One Wall Street analyst called late delivery of aircraft a &quot;cardinal sin&quot; and said the delays will also have an effect on AMR's third-quarter results.    AMR said it will lose about $50 million in revenue for all of 1988 as a result of the late deliveries by McDonnell Douglas. Although contracts with suppliers provide &quot;remedies for failure to perform,&quot; AMR said, &quot;the penalties do not approximate in any manner the amount of revenue that we have lost.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
