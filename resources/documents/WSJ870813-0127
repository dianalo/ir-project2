Gilmore to the new post of vice chairman of this railroad and truck transportation concern.    The company said Mr. Gilmore, who has been president since April 1986 and president and chief operating officer of its railroad subsidiary since January 1986, was named vice chairman as part of a planned management succession that coincides with his plan to retire in 1988.    As part of this change, Soo Line said Dennis M. Cavanaugh, 49, chairman and chief executive officer, will assume the additional post of president of both the parent and the railroad unit until the board names a successor. </TEXT></DOC>
