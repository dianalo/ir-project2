(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lifting a 1,000-ton reactor vessel fromits underground site at the nation's first commercial nuclear plantwas the hard part, but officials still have to take the 41-footvessel 7,800 miles to the dump.   The reactor pressure vessel and neutron-shield tank, packed withconcrete, were lifted from the ground Wednesday at the Shippingportnuclear plant and placed on a specially made transporter to be takento a storage site to until spring.   The vessel then will be put on a barge and shipped 7,800 milesvia several rivers and two oceans to a military dump in Washingtonstate.   The plant is the largest nuclear unit and only commercial reactorin the world to be dismantled. Several nuclear plants have beenmothballed or entombed.   The raising of the reactor pressure vessel is the most dramaticstage of the five-year dismantling of the plant, dedicated byPresident Eisenhower in 1957 and retired in 1982 after generatingabout 6.5 billion kilowatts.   ``Everything worked just like we expected it to. It's been verysuccessful,'' said Karen Wheeless, spokeswoman for the EnergyDepartment, which owns the plant.   Representatives of the two companies responsible for the $5million operation expressed satisfaction about the job.   ``This is not the biggest lift ever made, but it's one of themost complicated,'' said Don Nolan Jr. of Williams Crane andamp; RiggingInc. of Richmond, Va. ``It took about six months just to get readyfor this.''   Wednesday's big move was also the federal government's attempt toprove that reactors can be dismantled safely and affordably,providing a model for utilities when their reactors have outlivedtheir usefulness.   ``You've got to take reactors from the cradle to the grave. Ifyou can't handle the burial, there's some question of whether youshould be handling a reactor at all,'' Wheeless said.   Even success for the Shippingport operation will not solve theproblem facing the commercial nuclear power industry of where todispose of high-level commercial waste.   While waste from Shippingport is going to military dumps in Idahoand at Hanford, Wash., a national repository for spent fuel that wasto open in 1998 probably won't be open until the next century,Wheeless said.   The Energy Department estimates 15 U.S. nuclear plants will reachthe end of their 30- to 40-year useful lives by the year 2000.Almost all of the 12,000 metric tons of spent uranium from privatereactors is being stored in holding ponds.   Low-level radiation is left in the Shippingport reactor, but``unless you attach it to your body and wear it as an undergarment,there is no danger,'' Wheeless said.   Federal officials intend to remove all radioactive material sothe site 30 miles northwest of Pittsburgh can be returned tounrestricted use. The decommissioning is expected to be completed by1990 at a cost of $98 million.   The cylindrical reactor will be rolled to the Ohio River andplaced on a 200-foot barge in the spring and shipped via the Ohioand Mississippi rivers, the Gulf of Mexico, Panama Canal, PacificOcean and Columbia River to Hanford.</TEXT></DOC>
