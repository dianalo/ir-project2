The government newspaper Barricada urged Nicaraguans to preparefor a U.S. invasion.   A statement released by Ortega's office said the presidentextended the truce ``with the objective of enabling Contra (rebel)groups to put down their arms, take advantage of the amnesty andenter the normal life of the country.''   The cease-fire would have expired Nov. 1. Monday's action wasthe sixth one-month extrension by the government. The U.S.-backedrebels have said they extended the cease-fire indefinitely.   The formal truce went into effect April 1.   Sandinistas and rebels agreed on March 21 to halt operationsinvolving military offense. Two days later they signed a pactagreeing to try to negotiate a peaceful settlement of their8-year-old war.   Talks on a permanent settlement became stalemated in September.Each side has accused the other of frequent violations of the truce.   Monday's statement said Ortega's decision ``will not affectpopular mobilization plans for the defense of the fatherland.''   Barricada said the possibility of a U.S. invasion was increasing.   Under the headline ``Rising Threat,'' an editorial said Hondurantroops on Sunday harassed a Nicaraguan border village and accusedHonduras of what it called a recent series of cross-border attacks.   The government claims the attacks are part of U.S. plan toprovoke a border war with Honduras and American troops then wouldinvade to back Honduras.   A Barricada caption under a map of a region of Honduras thatjuts into Nicaragua said about 40 Honduran military posts had beenestablished in the area to protect 4,000 Nicaraguan rebels in campsin Honduran territory.   Last week Ortega claimed the United States armed 3,000 rebelsand ordered them back into Nicaragua to take advantage of thedestruction left by Hurricane Joan that slashed across Nicaragua onOct. 22.   ``Facing this new escalation of Yankee aggression the peoplewill have to strengthen their forces and mobilize ... theircombatants because we can't permit genocide,'' Barricada said.</TEXT></DOC>
