The trade-in program is apparently intended to hasten theacceptance of the Personal System-2 line _ introduced in April 1987_ as a new industry standard.   Although PS-2 sales have been healthy, there is still strongdemand for computers built to the old standard, such as the XT, theAT and compatible models made by such companies as Compaq ComputerCorp. and Tandy Corp.   IBM spokesman Scott Brooks said the promotion was still in theplanning stages and it was too soon to give details.   IBM dealers were informed of the promotion in recent weeks, InfoWorld, a weekly newspaper on personal computers, reported in itsMonday edition.   ``This is going to be an excellent program, something IBM hasnever offered before,'' Richard Rose, president of Dataflex Corp.in Edison, N.J., told the newspaper.</TEXT></DOC>
