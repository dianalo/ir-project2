SET TO RE-CREATEHABITAT ON BAYLANDS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Also ran in WT2  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;It's an exciting project,&quot; said Phil Bobel, the city's environmentalcompliance manager. &quot;Anytime we can pay back to the bay what we've taken out,we have a better chance to have species survive for our children and theirchildren.&quot;;    The project, which will take four months, was designed torestore the natural flow of saltwater to a corner of the baylands cut off fromtidal saltwater flows after a levee was built in the 1920s. The project alsowill help return the freshwater flow blocked from the area by the completionof the Bayshore Freeway.;    Two pipelines, each a quarter-mile long, will bebuilt. One will extend from the Palo Alto Regional Water Quality Control Plantto a 15-acre pond that will be dug.;    During fall, winter and spring, thepond will be fed with 1 million gallons of reclaimed water a day from thewater treatment plant.;    In the summer, the pond, which will discharge intoMatadero Creek, will be allowed to drain and dry out to discourage mosquitobreeding and the growth of bacteria that cause avian botulism, a common,deadly disease in stagnant areas around the bay.;    The other pipeline willextend from the harbor to the former International Telephone and Telegraphproperty the city bought in 1977. About 12 acres of existing sloughs willreceive 1 million gallons of bay water a day. At least eight inches of waterwill be maintained there year-round to support wildlife.;    About 70 yearsago, the area teemed with migratory birds and marsh life. Now, only remnantsof the once-abundant pickleweed survive.;    Indeed, 75 percent of the BayArea's wetlands have been destroyed over the years by rampant development,Bobel said.;    City officials hope this project will signal a rebirth of theold marsh. They hope it will become once again a habitat for the salt marshharvest mouse, the California clapper rail and the salt marsh yellowthroat --all threatened or endangered species found in greater numbers in Palo Altothan elsewhere around the bay.;    With this project, Palo Alto will join thecommunities of Hayward, Arcata and the Mountain View Sanitary District inContra Costa County to develop freshwater marshes using reclaimed water.;   Originally, city officials had hoped to start the project earlier this summer.But biologists asked the city to hold off a few more months so that wildlife,which normally migrates elsewhere at the end of summer, would not bedisrupted.;    In a few years if all goes according to plan, the whole areashould be greener and brighter. Aquatic plants should begin to sprout. Andislands built in the center of the pond should be home to nests full ofshorebirds and migratory waterfowl.;    At least, that's what's anticipated.;   &quot;Quite frankly we're not sure what it will look like exactly,&quot; Bobel said.&quot;Nature will decide that.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CAROLYN JUNG, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910814  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  569  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday August 14, 199100227268,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
