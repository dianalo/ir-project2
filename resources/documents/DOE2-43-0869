The resulting functions are relatedto the density-time functions. These functions include the constantsof distribution velocity and discharge velocity. They are modified byapplication of an iteration procedure (computer programme) to ensurethe adequate correspondence between the curves and the density-time-trends.Between the constants of inversion velocity and eversion velocity ofthe cortex of the kidney, there is a linear as well as allometric relationship,the correlation amounts to r = 0.99. In the case of all tumors, onlyan allometric relationship (r = 0.92) could be found as regards the conversionconstants.</TEXT></DOC>
