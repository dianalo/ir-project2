Though Bush and the allies are ready to move on Iraqweapons plants, they have powerful incentives to resolve theinspection dispute. A military attack on an Arab nation couldundercut the Mideast peace conference Baker has been piecingtogether. &quot;It could rebound to our disadvantage in the Arabworld,&quot; says one U.S. official.</LP><TEXT>   Saudi Arabia officials have to worry about the surgingpower of the religious right there. Egypt's Mubarak alreadysuggests publicly that it may be time to lift the punishmentsagainst the Iraqi people. The U.S. and the Saudis still wantto get rid of Saddam Hussein, but nobody has figured out away to do it.   White House aides fret that having Saddam Hussein stillaround during next year's political campaign would tarnishBush's war-victory claims.                                                                                                          LAWMAKERS SEEK to use Soviet food requests to revamp farmexport programs.   Democratic Rep. Glickman of Kansas pushes a bill tobroaden the use of export subsidies, make individual Sovietrepublics eligible for credits and let the U.S. offer veryliberal credit terms. It also would empower the president towaive the credit-worthiness test for export credits. The billis designed to counter European export subsidies as much asto help the Soviets.   Missouri Rep. Coleman cautions against making the programstoo liberal. But he and Senate Republicans will push similarbills that would help U.S. farmers increase exports. Toaddress U.S. political concerns, Gorbachev and Yeltsin agreeto Baker's demand that the central government and the Russianrepublic coordinate aid requests.                                                                                                          DEMOCRATIC HOPEFULS face a scramble to fund theirpresidential bids.   Between the slow economy and opposing Bush, &quot;they're allgoing to have a helluva time raising money,&quot; says mediaconsultant Carter Eskew. The Democrats will have to relyheavily on free media, analysts say. &quot;With new technology, acandidate can sit in a TV studio in Little Rock and givesatellite interviews to stations all over the country,&quot; saysformer Democratic party spokesman Mike McCurry.   Experts say a serious presidential campaign needs $10million to $15 million, maybe half what was needed last time.Harkin and Kerrey seem poised to raise the most among likelyhopefuls, with Clinton hard put to keep up. Wilder, though hecan rely on some wealthy donors in Virginia and the blackcommunity, has almost nothing bankrolled.   Only Cuomo, if he ran, could generate big bucks, politicalexperts say.   IOWA FADES as a top test for Democratic hopefuls. WithIowa native Harkin running, only Kerrey of nearby Nebraska islikely to make a serious run in hopes of a strong,attention-getting No. 2 finish. Clinton vows to avoid the&quot;Gore mistake&quot; of insulting Iowans by skipping their caucusesbut doesn't expect a major push.                                                                                                          GRAMM IN '96? Top political advisers to Texas Sen.

Gramm has used his post asSenate GOP campaign committee chairman to raise his nationalprofile.                                                                                                          A &quot;TRIBUTE&quot; to influential House Energy and CommerceCommittee Chairman Dingell at $7,500 or $15,000 a table isorganized by lobbyists. Many have interests before his panel,including lawyers for scientist David Baltimore, a target ofDingell criticism; and an official of Philip Morris, whichfears new tobacco-ad restrictions.

NUCLEAR BOMB-MAKING is pushed for the U.S., despite theCold War thaw.   The Energy Department wants to resume making plutoniumtriggers for nuclear bombs at its Rocky Flats, Colo., plant.In December, the administration will pick a designer for anew $5.5 billion tritium reactor. Officials argue thattritium stocks deteriorate and not building a new reactorwould amount to unilateral disarmament.   Opposition by Congress and environmentalists may block theRocky Flats plans. But Sen. Thurmond and Rep. Spratt of SouthCarolina and Georgia Sen. Nunn push for the new tritiumreactor at Savannah River, S.C. Some scientists argue that anew reactor isn't needed.   The administration &quot;can't get a handle on the way theworld is changing,&quot; complains Christopher Paine of theNatural Resources Defense Council.
