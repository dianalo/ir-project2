Eastern machinists, hoping to bolster their bargaining position,said they would set up picket lines at commuter railroads in the NewYork City area that serve 320,000 people daily.   ``This thing will really take off on Monday, when we take out therailroads. And we're prepared to do that,'' said Michael O'Connell,president of Local 1894 at New York's Kennedy International Airportafter the machinists' strike against Eastern began early today.   Eastern responded by cutting up to three-quarters of its weekendflights, including most flights out of its Atlanta hub and nearly 60other cities. The carrier's pilots and flight attendants said theywould honor the picket lines.   The Miami-based airline, however, planned to maintain service tonearly 50 cities, including most flights out of Miami and onEastern's Northeast shuttle and Latin American routes.   Eastern also said other airlines were honoring its tickets.   But the strike probably ruined a trip to Disney World for Phyllisand Alan Zisser of Oceanside, N.Y., and their 3-year-old son. Theyarrived at Kennedy airport as the strike began, and their Easterntickets to Orlando, Fla., weren't much good at the moment.   ``Even 48 hours ago they told me don't worry, we're not going onstrike,'' said Mrs. Zisser. ``Now I can't get on half the flightsbecause they're all booked and don't have enough money to pay thedifference some other airlines want.''   The machinists' union has contended that its union can picket anytransportation company covered by the Railway Labor Act, whichincludes airlines, railroads and some shipping concerns.   But other airlines insisted their machinists and other airlineworkers would be violating no-strike clauses in their contracts ifthey honored picket lines set up by Eastern strikers.   On Friday, a federal judge in Washington agreed with theairlines, and prohibited machinists' union members at other airlinesfrom joining the strike.   But in Newark, N.J., Gene Hoffman, general chairman of District100 of the Machinists, said union members at other airlines wereexpected to walk out.   ``There's a good possibility some of the other airlines will goon sympathy (strike) with us, such as TWA, United, Northwest andUSAir,'' he said.   In the New York City area, union leaders at the Long Island RailRoad, Metro-North Commuter Railroad and New Jersey Transit say theywill honor Eastern picket lines on Monday.   Robert Kiley, chairman of the Metropolitan TransportationAuthority, which oversees the Long Island Rail Road, andMetro-North, predicted ``absolute chaos next week. And the fact is,there's not a lot we can do.''   Ramses Hernandez, a striking New York machinist, said heunderstood that commuters would be upset if the strike expanded torailroads.   ``But we're fighting for all working people,'' he said. ``Wealready have agreed to lower our salaries but that's not enough.People just don't understand that this strike is not just for us. IfEastern does this to us other companies will try to do it to them.''   In Washington, the head of Amtrak said the national passengerrailroad could continue limited operations for only a few days ifpicketed by workers supporting a strike against Eastern.   Elizabeth Hale, a spokeswoman for Greyhound Lines, Inc. in NewYork, said they would be using 200 additional buses to run extranon-stop service between Boston, New York, Philadelphia andWashington, beginning Monday.   Travel agents said many Eastern passengers may be strandedbecause a lot of other airlines and railroads were fully booked.   Ida Cartazo, co-owner of the Mediterranean Agency in Lodi, N.J.,said she had a group of 18 college students scheduled to fly to FortMyers Sunday for spring break. The students made their reservations,including hotel, four months ago.   ``The only thing I could do is tell them to drive down,'' shesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
