Now Columbia's business school has blitzed a teacher for offering students a real-world incentive. Adjunct professor and tenured corporate raider Asher Edelman said he'd give students in &quot;Corporate Raiding: The Art of War&quot; his $100,000 finders fee for any exam that found a takeover candidate worth pursuing. Dean John Burton worried this would &quot;bias the academic environment,&quot; and canceled the offer. Dean Burton stopped the virus just in time; in a poll, 13 of the 14 students in the class approved of Mr. Edelman's offer. </TEXT></DOC>
