Democrats laid early claim to &quot;family&quot; issues this political season with sweeping proposals to aid working parents by expanding and subsidizing child care. But now, after a late start, prominent conservative activists are rallying behind proposals that also reward mothers who stay at home.    Conservatives already have sent warnings to Vice President George Bush that an ill-placed step on child care could spell trouble for his presidential campaign. Child care, says Donald Devine, who heads the Committee to Save the Reagan Platform, is &quot;up there with SDI (the Strategic Defense Initiative) and taxes&quot; as an election issue.    The conservatives are chiefly opposed to a bill, nicknamed ABC, introduced by two liberal Democrats, Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Rep. Dale Kildee of Michigan. The $2.5 billion bill would help establish and expand more child-care facilities, subsidize what low-income and middle-class working families pay for day care, and develop for the first time federal regulations for health and safety.    What many conservatives are backing instead are several plans -- probably delivered through tax code changes -- that would aid mothers who stay at home with their children as well as mothers who go off to work.    The coalition behind ABC warns of a national crisis in child care that cries out for a more forceful federal role. But groups like Mrs. LaHaye's Concerned Women for America, Paul Weyrich's Free Congress Foundation, Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum and the Heritage Foundation argue that just a small percentage of children -- and many of them from middle-income families -- would benefit from ABC. More regulations could actually drive up the cost and limit the number of day-care slots, they add. And they worry about limitations on aid to church-based day care -- which sponsors already promise to modify.    Still, there has been a sea change in the conservative movement.    Most no longer question whether child care is needed, but how to do it. Two Republicans, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, have even introduced legislation that would provide states with federal grants and give employers tax incentives to expand day-care programs. &quot;This is not the conservative movement that 20 years ago would have said government has no business subsidizing families like this -- period,&quot; says Gary Bauer, White House domestic policy chief. A White House working group is about to start fashioning child-care policy options for President Reagan. And though the administration hasn't yet backed a proposal, Mr. Bauer warns that any plan &quot;that failed to treat all families equally would be unacceptable.&quot;    Bills drawing wide support from conservatives include the &quot;Toddler Tax Credit,&quot; introduced by Rep. Richard Schulze (R., Pa.), which offers parents a $750 tax credit for every child under age six. &quot;You let the market forces control where they spend it,&quot; says Rep. Schulze, whose program would cost $8 billion annually. Another bill, offered by Rep. Clyde Holloway (R., La.) would give all parents of preschool children a tax credit ranging from $150 for higher-income families to $400 for lower-income families. (The current federal childcare credit is available only for work-related child-care expenses.)    Opponents of the conservative alternatives argue that the financial help they would give parents is paltry, and that they wouldn't improve the supply or the standards of day care. Many child-care advocates dismiss the conservatives as a vocal minority. &quot;There's still tremendous awareness within both parties that they've got to respond to the child-care issue,&quot; says Helen Blank, child-care director for the Children's Defense Fund, who notes support from Republicans on the ABC bill.    The next administration will almost certainly have to face the issue head-on. Sen. Dodd says that to keep his bill intact and to avoid the risk of a veto, he may be willing &quot;to wait another six or eight months,&quot; until the end of the Reagan administration. Even in the event of a Bush presidency, Sen. Dodd predicts a &quot;far more sensitive response than we're getting out of these neanderthals.&quot; Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the likely Democratic nominee, seems more like a sure bet. In his own state he increased child-care funding; as president he says he would endorse the goals of the ABC bill.    Part of the political awareness stems from the fact that many women work out of economic necessity, and that a generation of children raised in poor day care could pose future problems. A recent Labor Department report, while calling child care a critical issue for the work force, denied there is a child-care shortage and detailed $7 billion in existing federal aid. Little emphasized was the fact that $4 billion of that is tax credits that principally benefit middle-income and higher-income families.    Demographics may play a powerful role in expanding support for greater federal action. Nearly two-thirds of mothers with children younger than age 14 are currently in the work force, according to the Labor Department.    Even more striking, 57% of women with children under age six are working, up from only 12% in 1950. Those with especially critical child-care needs include 3.5 million single mothers who are working, 60% of whom make less than $15,000 a year.    Caught in the middle of these demographic and political currents is Mr. Bush. Though he has vowed that as president he would make child care &quot;a top priority,&quot; he doesn't think the federal government should or could afford to provide day-care services, and he doesn't think it should impose standards.    But the vice president hasn't endorsed any of the conservative alternatives, to the conservatives' dismay. Warns Mrs. LaHaye: If Mr. Bush doesn't &quot;stand strong on keeping government out of a domestic decision, it would really hurt him.&quot;    (See related story --- &quot;...
