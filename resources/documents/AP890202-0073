An unidentified female caller had contended the series'persevering protagonist is a better role model for Iranian womenthan the daughter of Mohammed, the founder of Islam.   Those remarks in this predominantly Shiite Moslem land of 50million people triggered an outcry similar to John Lennon's remarkduring a 1960s news conference that the Beatles were ``more popularthan Jesus Christ.''   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini angrily demanded the radio executivesbe punished for offending Islam and his wish was heeded.   Theology aside, the television show ``Oshin,'' which depicts agirl's travails in devastated postwar Japan, is wildly popular amongIranians as they recover from their eight-year war with Iraq.   Traffic stops and blackouts are postponed during broadcasts ofthe serial, whose heroine, Oshin, suffers every imaginable hardshipand setback.   The four executives were sentenced to prison terms by a Tehrancourt Tuesday for broadcasting the phone-in program.   Broadcast Director Mohammad Arab Mazar-Yazdi got five years andeach of the three others _ Mahmoud Abulqasemi, director of Islamicideology; Hamid Khunmeri, head of supervision; and Mohammad Rasekh,editor of ideological programs _ received a four-year sentence and50 lashes.   But the official Islamic Republic News Agency today quoted thedaily newspaper Jomhuri Islami as saying Khomeini agreed to pardonthe broadcasters on Wednesday after receiving an appeal on theirbehalf from Chief Justice Abdolkarim Musavi Ardebili.   The news agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Khomeini had stressedin a letter to the state-run radio's director that ``if proven therewas a deliberate insult'' the caller should ``receive the deathsentence.''   The revolutionary patriarch's fierce reaction to the callunderlined the religious passions that flow through Iran. But thosepassions have not kept the soap opera from captivating Iraniantelevision viewers.   The drama, whose broadcasts began last year in Iran, was chosenby officials who thought Oshin an exemplary role model for Iranianssuffering hardships that included Iraqi rocket attacks on Tehran andthe loss of, by some estimates, a million of their countrymen.   It became an instant hit.   Week after week, Oshin, struggles on despite food shortages andcruel relatives, loses her house in a fire, and faces trial aftertrial.   After Oshin's father died in one episode, an Iranian newspaperpublished a full-page obituary. Letters of condolence and telegramspoured in from all over the country.   When the heroine couldn't find enough rice to feed herself,sympathizers sent the TV station some of their own precious ricerationing coupons for her.   An Iranian schoolboy who recently traveled to Cyprus brought withhim a prized possession: a pocket-sized poster of Oshin, which hesaid he bought outside his school for about $2.50.   Oshin has become a popular brand name for everything from shoesto electrical appliances. According to travelers from Tehran, it'salso a favorite name for new-born baby girls.   Daily power outages, which last up to six hours in the largercities, are never scheduled for Saturday nights, when Oshin isbroadcast.   Just before the hour-long episodes, TV announcers ask viewers toswitch off all unnecessary electric lights and appliances so thepower supply will not be overloaded while the show is running.   One Tehran woman who experienced an unexpected blackout onSaturday recently while Oshin was showing, called a taxi to take herto another part of the city where the power was still on so shecould see the show.   The driver raced her to a cafe, where both sat down to see theprogram over a cup of tea.   Tehran's hectic traffic grinds to a halt while Oshin is on TV.   ``If you want to hail a taxi while Oshin is on you're out ofluck,'' one traveler from Tehran said.   Thus, on Saturday, birthday of the prophet's daughter FatimaZahra, when the woman who telephoned in to the daily ``Family''radio program was asked whether Fatima Zahra was a fitting model forIranian women, her answer was an emphatic `No.'   ``Fatima Zahra is not acceptable because she lived 1,400 yearsago,'' she said. ``I prefer Oshin.''</TEXT></DOC>
