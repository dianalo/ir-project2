Coden, president of Codenoll Technology.andM;&quot;Codenoll and Packard/GM are reducing the cost of using fiber optics belowthat of using copper, while jointly developing an entirely new technologybased on using plastic optical fibers in addition to glass optical fibers,&quot;Coden said.andM;Coden added that part of the impetus for signing the formal agreement was theincreased demand for the CodeNet products, as well as Packard/GM's ability toprovide manufacturing facilities and expertise that would enable customerdemands to be met.andM;&quot;With the assistance of Packard's manufacturing expertise, we are nowachieving the cost and quality targets for these products,&quot; he said.andM;Packard/GM's CodeNet production facility is located in Laupp, Ariz.andO;Development and design of the Lan products will be performed by engineersfrom Codenoll.andP;  Packard/GM engineers will perform manufacturing and qualityprocess development.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
