Extended Summary </ITAG>A. The Banking and Trading Concepts EPA is proposing certification banking and trading programs as a methodto reduce the cost of controlling heavy-duty engine (HDE) oxides of nitrogen(NO<T2>X</T2>) and particulate matter (PM) emissions while still maintainingthe same total level of emission control in-use. The banking and tradingprograms would create the opportunity for these cost reductions by allowingHDE manufacturers to trade (<T3>e.g.,</T3> buy/sell) NO<T2>X</T2> and PM emission credits within a model year or to bank creditsfor use in future model years. Industry-wide costs could be reduced sincemanufacturers can optimize their marginal costs of compliance across theindustry as a whole or across model years. The economic incentives createdby banking and trading programs would also act to promote the developmentand use of improved emission control technologies and the development andsale of HDEs using alternative fuels. To understand these proposed changes,a brief review of certification procedures may be helpful. Historically, EPA set HDE emission standards that required that each ofa manufacturer's HDE families be certified to emit at or below the emissionstandards. In a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice dated March 15, 1985 (50 FR 10606), EPApromulgated NO<T2>X</T2> and PM standards for 1991 and later model year HDEs that allowHDE manufacturers to average the emission levels for these pollutants betweenor among their engine families within specified subclasses. More specifically,the averaging program promulgated at that time included NO<T2>X</T2> averaging for heavy-duty gasoline engines (HDGEs) and NO<T2>X</T2> and PM averaging within three specified subclasses for heavy-dutydiesel engines (HDDEs). HDDEs used in urban buses may average NO<T2>X</T2> emissions with other HDDEs used in the same subclass, but areprecluded from any form of PM averaging. EPA recently promulgated a verysimilar averaging program for heavy-duty methanol-fueled engines (HDMEs)applicable beginning 1991. In the methanol averaging program, Otto-cycleHDMEs\1\<NOTE/> are treated in the same manner as HDGEs and diesel-cycleHDMEs are treated in the same manner as petroleum-fueled HDDEs.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ See Section II-A for a more detailed explanation of theHDE combustion cycles, types, and subclasses.The averaging concept allows some engine families to emit at levels abovethat of the standard, as long as other engine families produced by themanufacturer within a specified averaging set can offset these higher emissionlevels by emitting at levels below that of the standard. The averaged FELs(weighted by horsepower and actual U.S. production volumes) must be ator below the applicable emission standard. Averaging, therefore, allowsmanufacturers to optimize their emission control systems between differentengine families, which reduces control costs. However, averaging only benefitsmanufacturers with several (at least two) engine families within the allowedaveraging set. Trading is an extension of the averaging concept that provides the opportunityfor all manufacturers to optimize their emission control systems and reducecosts by allowing them to average their emissions with one another. Underthis program, an engine family with a relatively low emission control costcould be designed to be certified below the level of the emission standard,thus generating emission ``credits.'' These credits could then be traded(<T3>e.g.,</T3> sold) to another manufacturer who has one or more enginefamilies with relatively high costs of emission control. The second manufacturercould then design its families to be certified above the level of the standardand use the purchased emission credits to compensate for the differencebetween the level of the emission standard and the certified level. Aswith averaging, trading would be allowed only within specified tradingsets, which are described later in this section. Permitting emission controlsystems to be optimized through trading would reduce manufacturing, operating,and maintenance costs, while still maintaining the same total degree ofemissions control. Banking can also be viewed as an extension of the averaging concept. Bankingallows a manufacturer to produce emission credits and save them for a periodof time (banking) for future use within an established averaging or tradingprogram or for single application to a given engine family. Banking inherentlyexpands the emission control technology optimization and cost saving benefitsof averaging and trading since it increases the manufacturer's flexibilityby adding a time dimension over which credits can be used. One key advantage of banking is that it could help manufacturers by allowinga smoother transition of control technology between model years when newemission standards become effective. To accomplish this transition, a partialreduction in certified emission levels would have to be made before thenew emission standard becomes effective, in order to create credits. Whenthe new emission standard becomes effective, these credits could then beused in an averaging or trading program to provide the manufacturers greaterflexibility in reducing emissions from their engine families. The use ofbanked credits would also extend the time before a manufacturer's enginefamilies would have to attain the level of the new emission standards,which, in turn, provides manufacturers increased flexibility in terms ofproduct planning and development. Greater product planning flexibilityand some insurance against unforeseen emission-related problems duringproduction may also be afforded if banking is available during periodswhen emission standards are stable.Banking and trading programs are worthwhile because they increase the manufacturers'flexibility and provide the opportunity for a savings in the costs of reducingemissions. The value of emission credits is enhanced beyond that with averagingalone, because, under trading, credits become marketable and, under banking,credits take on a time value. In fact, it may be that banking and tradingprograms could provide an economic incentive to spur the development anduse of lower emitting engines or improved emission control technology togenerate credits. The achievements demonstrated through these engines andcontrol technologies could then serve as the technological basis for morestringent emission standards in the future. Thus, banking and trading programswould be anticipated to have environmental as well as economic benefits.The banking and trading programs proposed today have been carefully structuredto have no adverse environmental impact. No adverse impact would be expectedfrom trading, since emissions among the manufacturers' engines would averageout to the level of the applicable standards. Similarly, no adverse impactwould be expected from banking, since emission levels averaged over themodel years involved would be the same as those expected if all enginefamilies emitted at the level of applicable emission standards each modelyear. Moreover, under banking, emission reductions would be achieved earlierthan would otherwise occur, which would provide greater benefits to society.In ``present value'' terms, benefits realized in the near term are worthmore to society than benefits realized later in time. However, it should be clear that addressing any potential adverse environmentalimpact requires programs that are structured to minimize or eliminate possiblesituations which could lead to in-use emission increases. This requiresthat in the absence of better data, etc. transactions be limited to engineswith similar design, operating, and use characteristics. Such considerationsexisted when EPA first promulgated HDE NOx and PM averaging; and, as isdescribed below, EPA is proposing banking and trading programs with similar(although not identical) fuel and subclass restrictions as exist for thecurrent averaging program. Absent other possible measures or provisionswhich are discussed in Section IV below, EPA believes such restrictionsare necessary. B. Summary of the Proposed Programs The trading, banking, and expanded averaging programs which are the subjectof this proposal are summarized briefly below. More detail and supportingrationale are contained in Section IV of this notice. The banking program is proposed for the 1990 model year while the tradingand expanded averaging programs are proposed for the 1991 model year. Allwould include diesel-, gasoline-, and methanol-fueled HDEs. As in the currentNOx and PM averaging program for these engines, trading and averaging ofemission credits would only be allowed among engine families within specifiedsets. In general, these sets would be similar to those used in the existingHDE averaging program. For petroleum- and methanol-fueled diesel HDEs,trading would be permitted only between engine families within the samesubclass (<T3>i.e.</T3>, light, medium, or heavy). As with the current averagingprogram, cross-subclass trading would not be allowed for diesel engines,except possibly as discussed in Section IV. Also like the present averagingprogram, trading would be allowed among all gasoline- and methanol-fueledOtto-cycle HDEs. To increase the manufacturers' flexibility and the potential cost savings,today's notice proposes three new provisions beyond those in the currentHDE averaging program. These provisions do reflect a shift from past policies,but should not cause adverse environmental or equity impacts. The provisions,which are described below, would be applicable to both averaging and tradingfor 1991 model year HDEs and, thus, would revise the current averagingprogram. First, due to the similar emission traits (high NO<T2>X </T2>and PM emissions relative to those of HC and CO) and expecteduse characteristics of diesel-cycle engines, averaging and trading betweenpetroleum- and methanol-fueled diesel HDEs would be permitted. Likewise,averaging and trading between gasoline- and methanol-fueled Otto-cycleHDEs would also be permitted because of their similar emission traits (highHC and CO relative to NOx and PM) and expected use characteristics. However,exchanging PM and NO<T2>X </T2> credits between engine families in the different petroleum-and methanol-fueled diesel HDE subclasses would still not be permitted.Also, averaging and trading between ``diesel-cycle'' and Otto-cycle HDMEswould not be permitted except as noted below. Second, a new heavy heavy-duty engine (HHDE) category would be establishedand would be analogous to the current heavy-HDDE subclass but would alsoinclude HDDEs, HDGEs, and HDMEs. Cross-fuel averaging and trading betweenall engine families in this HHDE category would be allowed for NOx, regardlessof the fuel used. Third, the averaging, trading, and banking programs would be extended tocover the urban bus particulate standard. In so doing, PM averaging andtrading would be allowed among all urban bus engine families (<T3>i.e.</T3>, HDDE and HDMDE urban buses). Exchanging PM credits betweenurban bus engines and other HDEs would still not be allowed. However, NOxaveraging and trading with other HDEs would be permitted. As previously stated, the three new provisions proposed above representa shift in EPA's past policy regarding cross-fuel credit exchanges. Theseprovisions are being proposed for two reasons. First, they would providea small increase in flexibility and therefore could provide a cost savingsfor manufacturers. However, they are still relatively limited in natureand would not be expected to lead to significant adverse equity or environmentalimpacts. Second, these provisions would help promote the use of alternativefuels (at present, methanol) which could provide an environmental benefit.The benefits of expanded averaging, trading, and banking would be increasedover those expected from a more limited approach which does not includesuch flexibilities. Nevertheless, it is important to note that averagingand trading between HDGEs, HDDEs, and HDMEs would be permitted only forNO<T2>x</T2> credit exchanges between engines within the new HHDE category.No other cross-cycle averaging or trading is proposed, including creditexchanges between Otto-cycle and diesel-cycle HDMEs. Although cross-cycleexchanges of PM credits would not be allowed under the proposal, EPA wouldconsider establishing such a program if manufacturers provide specificproposals (e.g., test procedures, emission standards, etc.) to implementsuch a program. Furthermore, as with the past averaging programs, bankingand trading would not apply to engines certified under the California vehicle/engineemission control program. These California engines would not be allowedto either generate or use credits. Cross-pollutant credit exchanges arealso still prohibited. Finally, in terms of banking EPA is proposing two different approachesfor comment and is also seeking comment on several parameters which needto be considered in the design of a banking program. First, EPA is proposinga NO<T2>x</T2> and PM banking program that would be effective only during thetransition period to stricter standards for either pollutant. Under thisprogram, the generation and deposit of NO<T2>x</T2> and PM credits could occur one to three model years prior tothe model year in which the new standard takes effect. The withdrawal anduse of credits would be allowed beginning the same year when generatedand ending two model years after the new standard takes effect. With thisrelatively limited banking program, no credit depreciation provisions arebeing proposed. Under this approach, banking would first be made availablefor the 1991 NO<T2>x</T2> and PM standards and would continue for the 1994 standards.This proposal would allow deposit of credits in model years 1990 through1993 and withdrawal of credits in model years 1991 through 1995. As analternative approach, EPA is proposing a rolling banking program wherecredits for banking could be generated in any model year and would havea life of up to five years. (This will henceforth be referred to as therolling banking program.) With regards to this second proposal, EPA isspecifically seeking comment on the need for and desirability of a rollingbanking program, the appropriate credit life, and whether or not and ifso, how credits should be depreciated. Banked credits could be used in an averaging program, traded, or appliedsingly to a given engine family. However, the use of banked credits wouldbe subject to the restrictions which are applicable to the engine type(cycle, fuel, subclass) which originally generated the credit. C. Summary of Economic Benefits The savings in emission control costs that would accrue from a programdue to trading were estimated under an EPA contract.\2\<NOTE/> The potential savings estimates fall into two basic categories:(1) Avoided costs of fuel consumption increases resulting from NO<T2>x</T2> -reduction techniques and PM-reducing trap oxidizers and (2)deferred initial purchase and maintenance costs for trap oxidizers. Usingthe 1991 emission standards and a program structure similar to the existingHDE averaging programs, the economic analysis showed that trading couldsave approximately $7.8 million per year in total emission control costsover those expected with averaging alone. An important benefit reflectedin this value is the ``evening out'' of cost savings among manufacturers.Through trading, all manufacturers would have the opportunity to obtaincredits and thereby reduce their costs. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ ``Savings From the Application of Trading and Averagingto Heavy-duty Engine Regulation,'' Sobotka and Company, Inc., August 1986.(All documents footnoted in this preamble are available in the public docketsreferenced in the Addresses section.) The cost savings study was prepared before a banking program was consideredand the methanol-fueled HDE regulations were promulgated. The study alsodoes not include the potential cost savings which accompany the three newcross-fuel provisions discussed above. Furthermore, potential cost savingsare probably understated because data was not available to account forcost differences among manufacturers and compliance cost differences amongengine families themselves. As data permits, these will be taken into accountin a forthcoming updated version. Conversely, due to recent technologychanges in the HDDE field, many manufacturers now feel that particulatetraps will not be required on most families in order to meet the 1991 PMemission standard. This could reduce the potential cost savings. Althoughthe economic model requires updating, the existing results do provide ageneral idea of the benefits that can be obtained with banking and trading.The results of the analysis are shown in Table 1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4> Table</T4> 1._<T4>Emissions Control Costs for 1991 Standards </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Million dollars per year] </ITAG><H1>Category </H1><H1>Control cost </H1><H1>Savings</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Baseline_No averaging or trading <D>$1,009.6 </D><D> </D></ITAG>Averaging vs. Baseline: <ITAG tagnum="2">Fuel andamp; Subclass Restrictions <D>$886.5 </D><D>$123.1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Fuel Restrictions <D>851.4 </D><D>158.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Unrestricted <D>818.1 </D><D>191.5 </D></ITAG>Averaging andamp; Trading vs. Averaging: <ITAG tagnum="2">Fuel andamp; Subclass Restrictions <D>$878.7 </D><D>$7.8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Fuel Restrictions <D>842.4 </D><D>9.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Unrestricted <D>710.9 </D><D>107.2</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">II. Development of Proposal </ITAG>As was mentioned previously, EPA published a March 1985 rule which promulgateda series of emission standards aimed at reducing the level of NO<T2>X</T2> and PM emissions from HDEs. Beginning in the 1990 model year,the HDE NO<T2>X</T2> emission standard will drop to 6.0 grams per brake-horsepower-hour(g/BHP-hr), with another reduction to 5.0 g/BHP-hr required for 1991 HDEs.For HDDEs, PM emissions were regulated for the first time starting withthe 1988 model year, with an emission standard of 0.60 g/BHP hr. For 1991,the PM standard drops to 0.10 g/BHP-hr for urban buses, and by 1994 thePM standard will be reduced to 0.10 g/BHP-hr for all HDDEs. EPA set these standards according to the technology-forcing mandate ofthe Clean Air Act. At the same time, EPA sought to provide the regulatedindustry and society as a whole with the most cost effective means of achievingand demonstrating compliance with the emission standards. EPA has determinedthat emissions averaging programs are desirable for the NO<T2>X</T2> and PM emission standards for HDGEs, HDDEs, and HDMEs (exceptfor urban . buses in the case of PM) beginning in the 1991 model year.EPA designed the averaging programs in such a way as to reduce the costof compliance with the relatively stringent emission standards, while stillgaining the full emission reduction anticipated by implementing more stringentstandards. Thus, the overall cost effectiveness of the standards was improved.With today's notice, EPA is proposing to expand the existing HDE averagingprogram to cover urban bus PM standards and to include banking and tradingprograms for all HDEs to further enhance the cost-effectiveness of theseHDE NO<T2>X</T2> and PM emission standards. Three brief discussions are presentedbelow to provide background information which may be helpful to understandthe details of this proposal. First, to help explain the structure of theaveraging, trading, and banking programs, a brief review of EPA's HDE categorieswill be presented. Second, since it is the basic building block for theproposed banking and trading programs, the existing averaging program willbe described. Finally, a short review of the history of banking and tradingwill then describe how the proposed programs grew out of the existing averagingprogram. A. Engine Category Description HDEs fall into several categories. The two major distinctions between HDEsare the type of combustion cycle used to generate power and the type offuel burned. Presently, the two types of combustion cycles used in HDEsare the Otto cycle and diesel cycle (sometimes called the compression-ignitioncycle). Historically, Otto-cycle HDEs have burned gasoline fuel, whilediesel-cycle HDEs have burned petroleum-based diesel fuel. However, methanol-fueledOtto-cycle HDEs and methanol fueled diesel-cycle HDEs are now being developed.Since the trading, banking and expanded averaging programs affect all HDEs,some classification terminology would be helpful to facilitate the followingdiscussions. The following acronyms will be used to represent each of thefour major engine types as described in Subpart A of the Code of FederalRegulations: <ITAG tagnum="15">HDGE: heavy-duty gasoline-fueled Otto-cycle engine </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">HDDE: heavy-duty petroleum-fueled diesel engine </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">HDMDE: heavy-duty methanol-fueled diesel engine </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">HDMOE: heavy duty methanol-fueled Otto-cycle engine</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For sake of completeness it should also be noted that the acronymHDE refers to all heavy duty engines while HDME refers to all heavy-dutymethanol fueled engines. In addition to categorizing HDEs by the combustion cycle and fuel type,HDEs are also categorized by other criteria. HDDEs and HDMDEs can be categorizedinto light, medium, and heavy subclasses. The determination of subclassis based on factors such as the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of thevehicle in which the engine is installed, vehicle usage and operating patterns,vehicle design characteristics, engine horsepower, and other engine designand operating characteristics. Light heavy-duty diesel engines (LHDDEs) usually have non-sleeved cylinders,are not designed for rebuild, generally have horsepower ratings between70 and 170, and normally are found in vehicles having a GVWR between 8,501and 19,500 pounds. Medium heavy-duty diesel engines (MHDDEs) include bothsleeved and non-sleeved engines, may be designed for rebuild, and havehorsepower ratings typically from 170 to 250. They are normally found invehicles with a GVWR between 19,501 and 33,000 pounds. Heavy heavy-dutydiesel engines (HHDDEs) are sleeved and are designed for multiple rebuilds.Their rated horsepower generally exceeds 250, and they are normally usedin vehicles whose GVWR exceeds 33,000 pounds. EPA expects future HDMDEsto have similar designs and operating characteristics and would thereforefall into similar categories. While there are also some differences among HDGEs, the broad differencesin horsepower, basic engine design, useful life, usage patterns and rebuildpatterns do not exist for these engines. Because of these similarities,there are no subclasses for HDGEs. Since HDMOEs would be expected to competewith and, in some cases, replace HDGEs, future HDMOEs would be expectedto have the same operating and use characteristics as HDGEs. Thus, thereare no subclasses for HDMOEs.The HDE group also includes a special sub-group, urban bus engines. Asdescribed in the Code of Federal Regulations, an urban bus is a heavy-dutydiesel-powered vehicle with a load capacity of fifteen or more passengersintended primarily for intra-city operation Its use is characterized byshort rides and frequent stops. The recent final rule implementing emissionstandards and other provisions for methanol-fueled vehicles/engines expandedthis definition to include HDMDEs. B. Existing Averaging Program The proposed HDE banking and trading programs are designed as an extensionof the current HDE averaging concepts and utilize the same basic rationaleand structure as the existing HDE NO<T2>x</T2> and PM averaging program. To help explain how today's proposalwas developed, a review of the structure, rationale, and procedures usedin the existing HDE averaging program is included below. First, in terms of structure, the current averaging program was designedto apply to all three types of HDEs: HDGEs, HDDEs, and HDMEs. To maximizethe manufacturers' flexibility and the potential cost savings, a largelyunrestricted program structure was desirable. However, as discussed inthe preamble for the averaging rule (50 FR 10606, March 15, 1985), manycommenters expressed concerns that a largely unrestricted program couldhave adverse environmental and equity effects. Some commenters stated thatlocalized increases in pollutant concentrations could result from a nonhomogeneousdistribution of vehicles in an averaging program. Other commenters wereconcerned that cross-fuel averaging could result in fleetwide emissionincreases and adverse equity effects. Some commenters also argued thatthe large differences in manufacturer size would result in large differencesin the extent to which manufacturers could make use of an averaging program.Manufacturers with very diverse product lines could utilize averaging toa greater extent than manufacturers with limited product lines and therebycould obtain a larger reduction in costs. EPA generally agreed with these comments, and therefore, established severalprohibitions to address these potential adverse equity and environmentalimpacts of an averaging program. Under the present HDE averaging program,cross-fuel averaging is not permitted. Also, for similar reasons, cross-subclassaveraging is not permitted for HDDEs and HDMDEs. No such restrictions existfor HDGEs and HDMOEs since subclass categories do not apply to these engines.Finally, because of their unique operating mode, HDEs used in urban busesare not permitted to average PM emissions at all. However, these specialprovisions do not apply to urban bus NO<T2>x</T2> emissions. For NO<T2>x</T2> emissions, urban buses are treated as other HDEs. Second, in terms of procedures, it should be noted that participation inthe averaging program is voluntary. Manufacturers may choose to precludeany or all engine families from averaging. Manufacturers electing to participatein the HDE averaging program must determine, prior to certification, emissionlimits for each family to be included in the averaging program. Each familyemission limit (FEL) has the same relationship to a particular engine familyas emission standards currently have to all engine families. The FELs areto be set by the manufacturer at levels both above and below the emissionstandard. However, there is a ceiling level, determined by EPA, above whichno engine family will be certified. Compliance is evaluated two different ways. First, each engine within afamily must meet the FEL for that family just as if it were an emissionstandard. Second, the FELs for the families in the averaging set will beaveraged to determine compliance with the applicable emission standardfor HDEs by calculating a production- and horsepower-weighted average emissionlevel. This method weights the emission contribution from each engine family,not only by production volume but also by the useful work that the enginesperform (the rated power). Actual emission levels from emission testing(<T3>i.e.</T3>, from certification, SEA, or in-use testing) are not usedin the averaging calculations; only the FEL values are used. For manufacturers electing to use averaging, EPA will grant a certificateof conformity to each family that demonstrates compliance in the certificationprocess with its PM or NO<T2>x</T2> family emission limit. It is a condition of each such certificatethat the manufacturer's weighted FELs, when averaged, meet the applicableemission standard(s) (PM, NO<T2>x</T2> or both) at the end of the model year. The certificate(s) ofconformity will be rendered void <T3>ab initio</T3> at the conclusion of the model year for those engineswhose production caused a weighted average FEL level to exceed the applicablestandard. C. Proposal History The banking and trading proposal is the product of four years of developmentand reflects input from a number of parties. These include members of theregulated industry, trade associations, environmental groups, other governmentagencies, and State governments. The following discussion describes theevolution of today's proposal.In the October 15, 1984 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) covering HDENO<T2>X</T2> and HDDE PM emission standards, EPA proposed that manufacturersbe permitted to use a form of emissions averaging as part of their complianceapproach. In addition, EPA requested comments on the possibility of establishingan emissions trading program for HDE NO<T2>X</T2> and HDDE PM credits to complement the proposed emissions averagingprogram. In the course of developing the final rule, EPA was able to satisfactorilyaddress the concerns raised in the comments received on averaging, andthe NO<T2>X</T2> and PM averaging program discussed above was adopted. However,action on the emissions trading program was deferred, largely because thecourt-imposed schedule for promulgation of the NO<T2>X</T2> and PM emission standards did not allow adequate time to workthrough the comments received on the trading concept. Shortly following the decision to postpone action on emissions trading,EPA formed a technical committee to more thoroughly study the issues raisedwith regard to emissions trading and to develop details of appropriateoptions for dealing with these issues. Also, the study was expanded toinclude the possibility of adding a banking program to the trading program.The committee's study was completed, summarized in a staff report, andmade available to the public in September 1986.\3\<NOTE/> The economic analysis discussed in the Extended Summary wasalso released for public review at that time. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ ``Issue Analysis: Trading and Banking of Heavy-duty Enginee and Particulate Emissions Credits,'' EPA Staff Report, May 1986. On January 22, 1987, a public workshop was held to further discuss theissues presented in the staff report and economic analysis and to allowindustry and other interested parties the opportunity to respond to conceptualprogram structures. Representatives from 15 different manufacturers werein attendance, along with several government agencies. Formal presentationswere made by five manufacturers and EPA. Written copies of these presentationsare available in the Public Docket. The development activities for the averaging, trading, and banking programsdescribed above included only HDGEs and HDDEs. As a separate action, theAlternative Fuels Working Group of the Vice Presidential Task Force onRegulatory Relief was established to develop means to promote the use ofengines with low polluting characteristics_such as engines using alternativefuels. Among the actions considered by the working group was the use ofHDE emissions averaging, trading, and banking as an incentive to developengines of this nature. EPA as a member of this Task Force ultimately concurredwith this idea and agreed to propose these concepts. The methanol engineprovisions proposed in this notice reflect a fulfillment of that commitment,with due consideration to other important factors in the design of theactual program. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary and Analysis of Key Issues </ITAG>The content and structure of the rules proposed here today were shapedconsiderably by public participation. Opportunities for public participationincluded two formal requests for comment and a public workshop. The firstrequest for comment on the trading concept was made on October 15, 1984,in the NPRM for new NO<T2>X</T2> and PM emission standards (49 FR 40258). More recently, a requestfor comments was made when an EPA Staff Paper and Economic Analysis onbanking and trading was released on September 8, 1986 (51 FR 31959). Apublic workshop to discuss the issues presented in the staff paper waslater held on January 22, 1987. This section provides a summary of the comments received on the key issuesraised in the Staff Report and at the workshop, along with EPA's analysisof those comments. They have been grouped into the following areas fordiscussion purposes: Environmental Concerns, Equity/Competitive Concerns,Inclusion of Alternative Fuels, Credit Use/Life Options, and Legal Issues.At the time of the workshop, methanol-fueled engines were not being consideredas part of any near-term banking and trading program. Therefore, with theexception of the section on alternative-fueled engines, the following discussionsprimarily consider only HDGEs and HDDEs. A. Environmental Concerns Through the Clean Air Act (CAA), Congress has charged EPA with the responsibilityto protect and enhance the quality of the nation's air resources. Whileexpanded averaging, trading, and banking should result in overall emissionlevels equal to or less than that achieved if every engine met the emissionstandard, there are some factors that, unless appropriate provisions aremade, potentially could cause the overall emissions to exceed these levels.Comments in these areas have been broken down into potential national airquality impacts and potential local air quality impacts. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Potential National Air Quality Impacts </ITAG>Comments on national air quality concerned both potential adverse impactsand potential improvements that could result from banking and trading programs.The concerns centered on loss of emission design cushions, marketing strategies,``false'' credits, rebuild practices, cross-fuel trading, effects fromcombining banking and trading programs with an NCP program, and bankingeffects. Each of these is discussed below. When certifying an HDE to an emission standard or FEL, manufacturers incorporatemargins to account for both in-use deterioration in emission rates andvariability in emission levels between engines and emission tests. Thefirst concern is addressed by the use of a manufacturer-determined deteriorationfactor in certification, which requires that manufacturers include theeffects of this deterioration when demonstrating compliance with the standardor FEL. It is not mandated that the variability effects be addressed duringcertification, but most manufacturers incorporate design cushions, (thesafety margin between the certified emission level and the actual emissionlevels of the engines), to account for these effects. These design cushionsalso provide in-use compliance cushions for some engines. Some commenters and EPA expressed concern that the enhanced value of creditsunder banking and trading might provide an incentive to shave the deteriorationfactor and design cushion margins in order to create more credits. Thisin turn would result in an increase in emissions and perhaps failures ofemission standards or FELs in-use.In response, several manufacturers stated that any incentive to shave deteriorationfactors or design cushion margins under banking and trading would be morethan offset by the increased risk of failing Selective Enforcement Audits(SEA) or in-use recall evaluation testing. Further, it was suggested thatthese incentives exist under both the present certification program (everyengine meets the standard) and under the averaging program available in1991. Programs such as banking and trading might actually reduce problemsof this nature since manufacturers would have more flexibility for demonstratingcompliance.While EPA is concerned about potential emission increases resulting fromreductions in deterioration factors and design cushions, EPA agrees thatsimilar incentives exist under the present certification practice and underthe averaging program available in 1991. Also, there is some validity tothe claim that the availability of credits under banking and trading couldreduce the incentive to shave these margins in difficult compliance situations.This would especially be true if nonconformance penalties (NCPs) were notavailable. Thus, absent further information, EPA believes that any addedincentive to shave design margins would probably be small and could beminimized by maintaining a viable HDE enforcement program. In addition,given the historical information from past certification on compliancemargins (<T3>i.e., </T3>standard, zero mile level, certified level), it would bepossible to identify situations where compliance margins are being reducedinappropriately. In these cases further investigations would be warranted.Second, some commenters were concerned that potential false (erroneous)credits could cause an increase in emissions. A credit would be ``false''if the actual in-use emission level of the engine exceeds its certifiedlevel. In addition, if credits are based on projected engine sales, thenany error in these sales projections would also result in the generationof erroneous credits. In both cases, before discovery of the error, thefalse credit could be traded to another manufacturer for use in certification.The use of false credits would then result in an in-use emissions increase.EPA believes credit problems of this nature can be avoided. The largestpotential for erroneous credits lies in inaccurate sales projections. Itmay be possible to minimize the impact of these potential errors by requiringquarterly reports of quarterly and cumulative actual U.S. production volumesand credit exchanges. If a manufacturer is not obtaining the needed creditsduring the year, the manufacturer could reduce the number of high-emittingengines being produced or take other measures, in accordance with the numberof credits available. Manufacturers of engine families with FELs abovethe emission standard would be liable to penalties if they were unableto obtain sufficient credits.EPA agrees that false credits could be generated by in-use HDEs failingtheir FELs or the emission standards. However, from an air quality perspectivethis problem is essentially no different than under the present certificationprogram or averaging. The number of engine families certified would notincrease, and there is no evidence to indicate that the number of failuresor the degree of failure would increase. Selective Enforcement Audits andin-use testing would still be conducted. Thus, no adverse air quality impactwould be expected.The third air quality concern centered on the diversity in HDE rebuildpractices. As discussed previously, HHDDEs are designed for multiple rebuilds;some MHDDEs are rebuilt; and LHDDEs and HDGEs are not normally rebuilt.Rebuilds essentially increase the average lifetime of engines. However,present regulations only require certification for the useful life (essentiallythe interval to retirement or first rebuild), which means that enginesusing credits need only accrue enough credits to meet this requirement.An increase in emissions could occur if the engine type \4\<NOTE/> generating the credits is rebuilt less frequently (percentof engines rebuilt) or has fewer multiple rebuilds per engine than theengine type using the credits. A similar concern would exist if the rebuiltengine emission characteristics (between the two engine types) are substantiallydifferent from the certified level. In addition, a concern was expressedthat even within a given engine type, rebuilding of higher emitting enginesmight be more attractive and less costly than lower emitting engines. Thiscould lead to a disproportionate number of rebuilds for the higher emittingengines and an increase in emissions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ ``Engine type'' refers to engines within a given cycle,fuel, and subclass (if applicable) category.EPA believes that rebuilt engines would have the greatest potential foradverse environmental effects if cross-fuel and cross-subclass tradingwere allowed. Cross-fuel trading is a concern because, in general, HDGEand HDDE rebuild practices are considerably different. Similarly, cross-subclasstrading for HDDEs is a concern because of the diversity in rebuild practicesamong the three HDDE subclasses.These basic concerns can be addressed in one of two ways: prorating orprogram structure restrictions. An effective prorating scheme would requirethat credits be adjusted according to the average lifetime emissions ofthe engines involved. For example, assuming no rebuilt engine emissionrate effects, if rebuilding practice differences cause one engine typeto have an average lifetime three times as long as another, then threetimes the amount of credits otherwise required for certification wouldbe needed to achieve equivalence when trading credits from the second enginetype to the first. As was the case when the averaging program was developed,a precise implementation of this approach requires more detailed informationon HDGE and HDDE rebuild frequencies, intervals, and emission effects thanis now available. Until rebuild practices and average lifetime effectsare better understood and characterized, a prorating scheme which wouldallow cross-fuel or cross-subclass trading without raising air qualityimpact concerns cannot be effectively established. (One possible alternativeapproach to this problem is discussed later in Section IV of this Preamble.)However, one way that air quality concerns due to differences in HDE rebuildpractices could be minimized would be to allow trading only between familiesof the same engine type. This restriction was incorporated into the presentaveraging program in part to address this air quality impact concern. Underthis approach, an LHDDE family could trade only with another LHDDE family;an HDGE family could trade only with another HDGE family; etc. While somesmall rebuild practice differences exist even among engines within thesame fuel/subclass group,\5\<NOTE/> EPA does not expect they would measurably effect the airquality. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ ``Diesel Engines,'' <T3>Fleet Maintenance andamp; Specifying;</T3> May 1981; pp. 39-44. Thisdocument is available in Docket No. A-81-11. Finally, within a subclass, rebuild differences between high- and low-emittingengines are not expected to be an appreciable problem. While a high-emittingengine could be cheaper to rebuild than a low-emitting engine, the costof rebuilding a low-emitting engine is still expected to be much less thanthe cost of purchasing a new engine. Thus, EPA expects low-emitting enginesto be rebuilt about as frequently as high-emitting engines. Since EPA doesnot expect to see a large difference in rebuild practices within a givensubclass, it does not believe there will be an air quality effect fromallowing trading within subclasses. A similar concern existed when averagingwas first considered for HDEs, and a similar conclusion was reached. A fourth air quality concern raised by the commenters related to the differentemission characteristics of gasoline and diesel engines. HDGEs have lowerPM and higher total hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissionsthan HDDEs. In addition, in many cases NO<T2>X</T2> reductions from HDGEs are generally less costly and more easilyachieved than for HDDEs. It should also be noted that the HDE NO<T2>X</T2> emission standard was set based on the reduction capabilitiesof the higher-emitting, harder-to-control diesel engines, instead of onthe lower-emitting, easier-to-control gasoline engines. In light of thesedifferences, commenters suggested that air quality could be adversely affectedby cross-fuel trading of NO<T2>X</T2> credits, since the less costly nature of the HDGE NO<T2>X</T2> reduction could encourage the production of HDGEs at the expenseof HDDEs. If this were to occur, HC and CO emissions could increase. While it is conceivable that cross-fuel trading of NO<T2>X</T2> credits would tend to directionally increase the desirabilityof producing HDGEs to generate NO<T2>X</T2> credits, it is also true that the availability of these creditscould make HDDEs less costly to buy and operate, and, thus, more attractiveto purchasers. Hence, whether any real sales shift would occur is questionable.Also, many other more important factors, such as durability and fuel economy,dictate engine selection for heavy-duty vehicles and transcend initialpurchase price. Furthermore, it should be noted that the air quality impactquestion cuts two ways. While it is true that under present standards totalHC and CO emissions could increase if more HDGEs are sold, it should alsobe noted that PM emissions would decrease. Nevertheless, especially forHHDEs, EPA does not believe that a cross-fuel NO<T2>X</T2> trading program would result in any measurable market shiftbetween HDGEs and HDDEs. However, as will be discussed later, there areseveral other important reasons why cross-fuel trading must be consideredcarefully. The other comments concerning potential nationwide air quality impactsfocused on the possible availability of both non-conformance penalties(NCPs) and banking and trading programs. Section 206(g) of the Clean AirAct requires EPA to issue a certificate of conformity for HDEs that exceeda section 202(a) emissions standard but do not exceed a ``practicable''upper limit determined by EPA, if the manufacturer pays an NCP establishedby rulemaking.\6\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Details on NCPs and their application to engine familiescan be found in the December 31, 1985 issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> [50 FR 53454]. Details on the interaction betweenNCPs and the existing HDE averaging program have not yet been proposed.Section 206(g)(3) also requires NCPs to be designed so as to:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Increase with the degree of emission nonconformity; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Increase periodically to provide incentive for nonconforming manufacturersto achieve the emission standards; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Remove any competitive disadvantage to conforming manufacturers.</ITAG>In general, two air quality concerns were raised with regard to the interactionbetween the NCP program and the banking and trading programs. First, somecommenters believed that banking and trading would expand the number ofoptions and time frame available for non-conforming engines to reach theemission standards and that, as a result, total HDE emissions could increase.A second concern was raised that a manufacturer may attempt to ``game''the NCP and banking programs to create credits for trading or for futureuse when NCPs become prohibitively expensive. This in turn would permitnon-conforming engines to be certified for longer time periods and couldlead to an increase in emissions over that expected with the NCP programalone.EPA agrees that banking and trading programs would allow engines emittingabove the emission standard(s) to be certified for a longer time periodthan might occur under the NCP program alone. However, no adverse air qualityimpact would be expected since these engines would be certified using emissioncredits generated by other engines emitting below the standards. Only underthe NCP program would increased emissions be allowed. EPA also agrees with the concern that the NCP and banking programs couldbe ``gamed'' to generate credits for future sale or use when NCPs becomequite expensive. A manufacturer may try to ``game'' the programs by requestingNCPs for engine families that could be meeting the emission standard byaveraging. (This assumes that more money would be made from the futuresale or use of the credits than could be saved by not paying NCPs.) Themanufacturer would be paying an NCP for one family while generating creditsthrough another engine family that could then be banked and then tradedor used to avoid paying NCPs in future years when the price of an NCP increases.Credits generated in this manner would undercut the purpose and impactof NCPs (NCPs are designed to provide an incentive to meet emission standards)and would result in emission increases (via an unnecessary use of NCPs).Thus, provision must be made to avoid the gaming situation outlined above.In order to maximize the potential economic and environmental benefits,banking and trading programs should be as widely available as possibleto provide the maximum degree of flexibility. However, their implementationor impact cannot be at odds with previously-established and statutorily-requiredEPA programs. Thus, the possibility of these practices described abovemust be eliminated, perhaps by not allowing a manufacturer to generatecredits for banking and trading from a given engine type if any of theengine families in this averaging set is using an NCP. A discussion ofthe interaction between NCPs and the HDE trading and banking programs ispresented in Section IV. In addition to the comments suggesting that banking and trading had thepotential to adversely affect national air quality, several commenterssuggested such programs could actually improve nationwide air quality.Banking of emission credits would accelerate air quality benefits by encouragingmanufacturers to produce lower emitting engines before a change in standards.The potential to sell credits would also be an economic incentive to investigatemethods to reduce emission levels below applicable standards. This incentivewould therefore encourage the development of improved emission controltechnology which could, in turn, serve as the technological basis for morestringent emission standards in the future. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Potential Local Air Quality Impacts </ITAG>Local impacts refer to air quality changes that may occur in more limitedgeographical areas, such as large cities, metropolitan areas, large urbanregions, or any other place with a large concentration of vehicles. Asis described in the previously mentioned EPA staff report, changes in localair quality as a result of unrestricted banking and trading could potentiallyoccur due to the differences in urban usage between the various enginecategories. These differences include both urban market share and urbanVMT fraction. HDEs differ greatly in these two aspects according to theirengine type and the intended vehicle application. Trading of credits couldadversely effect local air quality if the engines generating the creditshad less overall urban usage than the engines using the credits. Averagingposed the same potential problem. Depending on the amount of ``rural tourban'' credit trading, some commenters agreed with EPA that adverse localimpacts could occur. Also, as was discussed in the EPA staff report, local impacts could alsohave a time dimension if a banking program were added. This would primarilyoccur if emission credits were accumulated and hoarded over several yearsand subsequently used in one or two model years or within a specific typeof vehicle within a model year. Of course, if use of banked credits werelimited to the period following the transition to tighter standards, actualincreases in emissions (above levels that existed prior to the more stringentstandards) would not occur. Many commenters mentioned ways to minimize the potential increases in localambient levels caused by different urban/rural usage patterns. The suggestionsincluded using multiplicative credit correction factors based on urbanfractions (prorating), restricting banking and trading by fuel type and/orsubclass, and/or excluding urban bus engines from the banking and tradingprogram. Conversely, one manufacturer did not feel that banking and trading couldgreatly affect local air quality. This manufacturer provided three reasons.First, it stated that the heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) fleet contributes onlya small percentage of mobile source emissions and that no manufacturerhas more than 25 percent of the total HDV market. Second, the fleet turnoverrate is such that manufacturers would have to continue the given emissionstrategy for several model years in order to see an effect. Third, formany vehicles to emit above the standard, there must be an ample supplyof credits, which the manufacturer considered unlikely due to the stringencyof the future emission standards. Several points can be made in response. First, EPA does not believe thatHDV emissions are only a small portion of total mobile source emissions.While HDVs represent only about four percent of all vehicle registrations,\7\<NOTE/> they account for ten percent of the total vehicle miles traveled(VMT) per year.\8\<NOTE/> When these VMTs are multiplied by the 1985 NO<T2>x</T2> emission factors,\9\<NOTE/> HDVs account for more than 40 percent of the total NOx emissionsfrom mobile sources (2.73 million tons per year). Similarly, diesel HDVsaccount for 49 percent of mobile source particulate emissions for particulates10 microns or less in diameter.\10\<NOTE/> Of course, the contribution of HDVs to the mobile sourceNOx and PM inventories will decrease in the future as more stringent emissionstandards for these pollutants come into effect, but the relative importanceof their contribution remains. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>Fleet Characterization Data Used for MOBILE3, </T3>EPA Report EPA-AA-TEB-EF-84-2,August 1984.

The annual marketpenetration for new HDDEs into the fleet is on average about 15 percent;and, for new HDGEs, it is 13 to 14 percent. In addition, the market sharesof some manufacturers are considerable. Based on actual 1985 engine productionfigures reported to EPA by HDE manufacturers, one manufacturer had approximately45 percent of the total HDE market. In the HDDE subclasses, one manufacturerhad more than 60 percent of the LHDDE market and approximately 40 percentof the MHDDE market. Another manufacturer had 55 percent of the HHDDE market.Thus, the HDE market is structured such that small impacts on local urbanNO<T2>X</T2> and PM emission inventories are conceivable. In general terms, EPA agrees with the commenter's view that potential localizedimpacts would be small if the amount of available credits that could becreated were also small. However, the number of NNO<T2>X</T2> and PM credits which might be available for trading and bankingin 1991 and beyond remains to be seen. If the amount of credits availablewere small, both the potential local air quality impact and the benefitto the manufacturers would be small. If more credits than anticipated bythe commenter were to become available, then potential local air qualityimpacts with trading between engines of different urban usage characteristicswould become more important.  EPA agrees with those commenters who suggested that some measures wouldbe needed to address different urban/rural usage among the different HDEclasses and subclasses. A similar concern existed when averaging was firstconsidered, and fuel and subclass restrictions were deemed necessary toavoid any potential problems. The options available here, restricting tradingby fuel and subclass (as is done in the present averaging program) or usinga prorating scheme of some type to assure no increase in urban emissions,are similar to those discussed above when the effect of rebuilds was considered.While the parameter of concern here is urban/rural usage and not rebuildpractices, the finding is essentially the same. More detailed and preciseinformation on urban/rural usage of HDEs is needed to develop accurateprorating factors. Until such information becomes available, proratingcannot be effectively implemented to deal with this problem. Thus, programstructure restrictions are proposed, although one possible alternativeapproach is discussed in Section IV of this Preamble. Local air quality impacts due to a banking program could occur in the shortterm if credit hoarding is followed by liberal credit usage. This is unlikelyto be a problem because of the family emission limits ceilings and thebelief that banked credits will generally be most valuable to manufacturersin easing the transition to more stringent standards. Nonetheless, if EPApromulgates a rolling banking program, this potential problem can be addressedeither by depreciating banked credits or through some other program whichlimits credit life if EPA analysis indicates this is necessary. The positiveand negative aspects of each alternative are also discussed in SectionIV where the rationale for the proposal is presented. B. Equity/Competitive Concerns Among others, one of the purposes of the proposed HDE banking and tradingprograms is to provide manufacturers more flexibility to optimize theiremission control systems and thus to decrease the overall cost of meetingthe NO<T2>X</T2> and PM emission standards. However, when dealing with programssuch as this which have economic implications, care must be taken thatunfair and anti-competitive conditions not be created. Several points of background in this area will be helpful. First, the presentHDE market is divided between HDDEs and HDGEs; no HDMEs are presently beingproduced. Figure 1 shows the 1985 market shares by manufacturer for eachof the three HDDE subclasses. As illustrated, on the bottom of Figure 1,the HDDE industry is composed of 19 firms with a wide variety of productionlevels. The number of families in each subclass for each manufacturer isshown above the bars. Of the nineteen firms active in the HDDE market in1985, nine sold in only one subclass, eight sold in two subclasses, andonly two sold in all three subclasses. In terms of market share, at leasthalf of the firms have less than one percent of the subclass market sharein which they participate. Other firms hold at least a third of their respectivesubclass market share. Considering the entire HDDE market, seventy percent(13) of the firms have less than one percent of the market each, whiletwenty percent (4) of the firms each have over ten percent of the market.Two HDDE firms also have HDGE product lines and hold a substantial portionof that market.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration 2 050</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C  </ITAG>This diversity in market share fostered a wide variety of comments on bankingand trading. Most of the comments assumed various program structures andwere either supportive of or opposed to the assumed structure. Some commentersstated that the diverse range in manufacturer product line and size wouldcause banking and trading to be inherently inequitable due to the differentdegrees of flexibility and potential benefits among manufacturers. Somecommenters stated that the averaging program would also have to be revisedto reflect the degree of freedom allowed in the trading program, furtherincreasing the flexibility of some manufacturers over others. More specifically, commenters also stated that allowing cross-fuel trading(and averaging) would introduce an additional bias. Many commenters believethat NO<T2>X</T2> emissions can be reduced for less cost on HDGEs than HDDEs.Therefore, firms with both HDGE and HDDE product lines would have an advantagesince, other things being equal, they could have an institutional preferenceto use their HDGE credits to average with their HDDE engines before tradingthem to a competing firm. Some commenters stated that allowing HDGE and HDDE NO<T2>X</T2> emissions to be averaged effectively reduces the stringencyof the NO<T2>X</T2> standard for HDDEs, thus reducing the cost to control NO<T2>X</T2> emissions for HDDEs. This would occur because the NO<T2>X</T2> standard applicable to both HDDEs and HDGEs was set based onthe greatest degree of emission reduction that HDDEs could achieve. Also,due to the trade-off between NO<T2>X</T2> and PM emissions on an HDDE, allowing higher NO<T2>X</T2> emissions on an HDDE would also allow PM emission reductionswithout additional control techniques and costs. This reduction in PM emissionsis believed by some commenters to grant the manufacturer of both gasolineand diesel HDEs an additional design and cost advantage over their lessdiverse competitors. A few manufacturers were concerned with the use of banked credits as apredatory market tool. A manufacturer could acquire or accrue a large amountof credits and then use them to produce higher emitting engines withoutcertain emission control features or with higher performance. In turn,these engines could be more attractive from a market perspective and, withthe limited supply, could provide an extra profit margin to the manufacturermarketing those engines. The commenters felt that use of credits in thismanner would help a manufacturer avoid the impact of the emission regulationsthat all other manufacturers normally face. The manufacturers who statedthis concern recommended limiting credit life under banking to help preventlarge accumulations and subsequent predatory behavior. Finally, other commenters mentioned that trading would permit all manufacturersto participate in an industry-wide averaging concept, which would allowthe benefits to be spread more evenly among the firms, thereby enhancingcompetition. Smaller firms with narrow product lines could take greateradvantage of the cost-savings permitted by more flexible regulations. Theflexibility offered by banking and trading would further increase competitionby strengthening smaller, less diversified firms, stimulating the industry,and resulting in improved products at reduced costs. Enhanced competitioncould also remove potential market entry barriers for new firms, as theavailability of credits would provide alternatives to traditional engine-family-by-engine-familycompliance with the NO<T2>X</T2> and PM emission standards. EPA agrees that trading would permit all manufacturers to benefit fromthe averaging concept and thus would enhance equity and competition. Also,banking would expand the scope of these potential savings for all manufacturers.With properly developed programs, banking and trading would help promotefree market competition. However, the diversity of the manufacturers' product lines requires thatvery careful consideration be given to the structure of banking and tradingprograms so that the goals of these programs are achieved without adverseequity or competitive impacts. The possibility that the structure of atrading program could also impact the structure of the averaging programadds an additional cause for careful consideration. Equity and competitive concerns are discussed below for several differentprogram structures. Air quality concerns are an equally important factorin the overall evaluation and were discussed previously in part A of thissection. Banking program design considerations are different and are presentedseparately following this discussion. However, the use of banked creditswould be subject to the restrictions placed on the averaging and tradingprograms. As discussed in the EPA staff report, three general frameworks for trading(and potentially averaging) are possible: unrestricted, partially restricted,and fully restricted. The unrestricted framework allows trading (and, potentially,averaging) between all HDE families, regardless of fuel type and subclass.The partially restricted framework allows trading (and, potentially averaging)only by engine families using the same type of fuel. The fully restrictedframework permits trading within fuel type and subclass only, as is donein the present averaging program.To some degree, the concern over adverse equity and competitive concernsdepends on whether the framework considered applies to both averaging andtrading, or just trading. In previous analyses of the possible frameworksfor the HDE averaging program, EPA was concerned that unrestricted or partiallyrestricted averaging programs introduce equity concerns which could notbe addressed through other mitigating provisions within the program design.Thus, the program framework which restricts by both fuel type and subclasswas implemented for the HDE averaging program. The current structure ofthe HDE market is no less diverse than when the original HDE averagingprogram was selected, and indeed it is possible that the diversity couldincrease even more in the future as alternative-fueled engines are developed.Therefore, no major change in the framework used in the averaging programappears warranted. However, the considerations may be somewhat different if only trading isconsidered. A trading program as unrestricted as possible would maximizethe potential amount of NO<T2>X</T2> and PM credits available for trading and also would providethe greatest flexibility to allow such trades to occur. This in turn wouldincrease the incentive to generate credits through the development of newor improved emission control technology and would also promote the economicefficiency of the approaches available to the industry to meet the emissionstandards. Thus, cross-subclass trading could make the market for creditswork better. Not only would opportunities to trade be broadened, but if,as some manufacturers have stated, they are more likely to make tradeswith non-direct competitors, a less restricted program could have someadvantages. Nevertheless, in selecting the framework for just a trading program, thereare several equity considerations. First, there is the possibility thatsome manufacturers may view this concept as anti-competitive since manufacturerswith more diverse product lines could have the opportunity to enhance theiroverall economic positions relative to their less diverse competition.This would especially be a concern for cross-fuel trading. Second, thereis a concern that it may be difficult to prevent ``gaming'' of an unrestrictedor partially restricted trading program, which would circumvent the averagingprogram restrictions. To illustrate the first concern, an HDGE/HDDE manufacturer could traderelatively easily obtained NO<T2>X</T2> credits to HDDE manufacturers and then use the extra funds generatedto subsidize its HDDE or HDGE prices to gain market share. A related problemwould occur if credits are not freely traded and the seller of creditsdenies their availability to major competitors. On the other hand, notselling credits to other firms when the economic payoff for trading ishigher than the use of credits internally is not in the credit creator'sown economic self-interest. Profits would be foregone. Moreover, it isnot clear that the strategy of subsidization described above would be advantageous,because the transaction would have benefited the purchaser, too (otherwise,the trade would not have occurred). A subsequent lowering of prices bythe seller on his HDDE or HDGE subclass might thus be matched by the creditbuyer since the latter is now in a better position to match the pricesas well. Trades with an HDGE manufacturer could be particularly advantageousto smaller firms that otherwise might not be able to obtain credits fortheir HDDEs. The second concern centers on the possibility of circumventing the averagingprogram restrictions. Without adequate restrictions, manufacturers mayengage in the trading of credits among several families of different fuelsor subclasses in such a way that it has the net effect of averaging emissionsacross fuels or subclasses. While this is not likely to be a common practice,it is difficult to preclude once the program is implemented. One meansof providing a safeguard against this practice would be to allow manufacturersthat participate in the diesel subclass market to engage only in ``oneway'' trades; <T3>i.e.</T3>, the manufacturer could buy or sell credits from a givendiesel subclass but could not do both. In a general sense, if considered acceptable, different program structuresfor averaging and trading could address many of the equity and competitiveconcerns raised with averaging and in fact could enhance the availabilityof credits to those smaller, less diverse manufacturers who benefit lessfrom averaging. With some safeguards to address gaming, a less restrictedprogram than now in place for averaging may be possible for trading. Ofcourse, air quality impact concerns would also have to be considered. Asbefore with averaging, if these environmental concerns cannot be addressed,then restrictions are needed. Environmental, equity, and competitive concernsare evaluated together in the context of possible program structures inSection IV. Banking arises as a potentially useful policy, for several reasons. First,it could ease the transition to tighter standards. Second, it could increasethe manufacturer's product development and compliance flexibility. And,third, it is valuable to society to speed the process of reducing emissions.Thus, while banking would permit the decrease in emissions to occur moreslowly (and more smoothly) after the tighter standard  goes into effect,it would also provide society with the benefits of an earlier decreasein emissions from mandated levels than would otherwise have occurred. Theshort-term increase in emissions after the tighter standard goes into effectwould not be an increase above previous levels, but would merely representa reduction less than would have otherwise occurred with the effectivedate of the new and more stringent standard. Equity and competitive concerns with banking focus primarily on the inherentadvantage banking would afford to larger, more diverse manufacturers. Thefirst argument is that these manufacturers would have more opportunityto generate credits for banking which would increase their future flexibilityrelative to their smaller, less diverse competitors. This increased flexibilitycould lead to an economic advantage, but only on an absolute basis, nota relative basis. Carried to an extreme, large banks could result in foregoneprofits; particularly, as technology improves, the ability of all firmsto achieve emission reductions would reduce the value of banked credits.The second argument is that banked credits could be used as a predatorymarket tool. However, this use of banked credits would be largely precludedby the FEL ceilings.Finally, virtually any banking program would reduce to some degree theavailability of credits for trading at any given price. Manufacturers simplymay place a higher value on the internal use of credits than they couldobtain by trading them unless the price for credits rises. The more creditsare hoarded, the more their price will increase. This encourages more creditgeneration. Nonetheless, as was also the case in the air quality impactdiscussion, measures to encourage credit use within a reasonable time followingtheir generation could provide the incentives for appropriate and orderlyuse of credits, as viewed by EPA. The inherent advantage of larger, morediverse manufacturers could not be totally eliminated, but any potentialadverse effects on competitors from banking could be addressed throughthis approach. The combined effects of environmental and competitive concernson the structure of a banking program are discussed together in SectionIV. C. Inclusion of Alternative Fuels For over a decade, there has been active interest in the use of alternativetransportation fuels to reduce the dependence on petroleum-based fuels.In addition, alternative-fueled engines are typically ``clean burning,''providing an environmental impetus for their development. Since bankingand trading would encourage the development of engines that could generateNO<T2>x</T2> and PM emission credits, these programs could provide an incentivefor the development of alternative-fueled engines. Their use could, therefore,result in further reductions of emissions and emission control costs. Severalcommenters also suggested that alternative-fueled engines be included inthe banking and trading programs. To date, work in the area of alternative transportation fuels has centeredon methanol. Substantial work has been done on the development of variousmethanol engine designs for highway motor vehicles; and, hence, their NOxand PM emission characteristics are fairly well understood. Several citiesare even evaluating methanol-fueled urban buses in demonstration programs.Because of this development work and in response to public and privateinterest in methanol as a future motor vehicle fuel, EPA recently promulgatedfederal emission standards for methanol-fueled vehicles/engines. While primary emissions from methanol-fueled engines are fairly well understood,secondary emissions from methanol-fueled engines are not. Information onall methanol emissions, including potential health impacts from methanoland formaldehyde levels, is presented in detail in the aforementioned methanolrulemaking. There, EPA noted that direct exposure to methanol and formaldehydeemissions from methanol vehicles has the potential to pose a public healthrisk due to acute, toxic or, in the case of formaldehyde, carcinogenichealth effects. The rulemaking for methanol fueled vehicles also indicated that methanolcan potentially impact global warming depending on the feedstock used toproduce the methanol and the amounts produced. Methanol can be producedfrom coal or from natural gas. However, these processes release differentamounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. A complete switchto coal based methanol fuel systems could result in a doubling of the motorvehicle contribution to the greenhouse effect relative to the contributionof current petroleum-based fuels. However, methanol derived from naturalgas would have little or no effect. EPA believes that the quantity of methanol required for HDEs can be metfrom a natural gas feedstock. Therefore, use of methanol fuel in HDEs isnot expected to have an adverse impact upon global warming. However, theuse of methanol in HDEs would promote the development of an infrastructurewhich might encourage the use of methanol in other vehicle classes. Theeffect of greater use of methanol on global warming is uncertain. Sincethe available information is presently insufficient to resolve the aboveconcerns, the Agency will continue to investigate these issues and willtake appropriate action if warranted. EPA asks for comment on these concerns.Among other potential alternative transportation fuels, compressed naturalgas (CNG) is also receiving attention. However, CNG-fueled HDEs are stillin the early development stage and more work is needed to better understandtheir emission characteristics. Presently, there are no federal emissionstandards for CNG-fueled HDEs. Since methanol engines are the only alternative fueled HDEs with federalemission standards and other related procedures, only methanol-fueled enginesare included in the proposed banking and trading programs. However, EPAwill evaluate the possibility of including CNG-fueled or any other alternative-fueledHDEs in these programs in the future as federal emission standards andother related procedures are established. D. Credit Use and Life Options How emission credits could be used and how long a credit could be bankedwere two additional areas of comment. The obvious and well-supported useof credits was in the certification process where credits could eitherbe averaged or traded to show compliance with applicable standards. Bankingof credits received almost unanimous support from commenters. Banked creditscould be used for future averaging purposes or for future transactionswith other manufacturers. Banked credits could also be applied singly toone engine family. A suggestion was also made to use banked credits tocompensate for SEA failures of production engines. Similarly, many manufacturerswanted to be able to use banked credits to compensate for the emissionimpacts of in-use failures instead of recalling engine families. They believedthis feature would encourage credit accumulation, which would help theenvironment and would avoid the expense and problems of recall. EPA supports the use of credits obtained through averaging or trading inthe certification process. EPA also supports banking credits for use infuture certification and even in the case of SEA failure if a manufacturerchooses to recertify future production of the family involved to a higherFEL. However, EPA cannot allow manufacturers to use credits in lieu ofrecall to address failures determined by SEA failures or in-use testing.Section 207 of the Clean Air Act states that ``manufacturers shall remedysuch nonconformity''; and a federal court has held that, by ``remedy,''Congress meant recall and repair of noncomplying vehicles (<T3>Center for Auto Safety </T3>v. <T3>Ruckelshaus, </T3>747 F.2d l, D.C. Cir., 1984). Since the use of creditsto compensate for a failure does not constitute a remedy, use of creditsin this manner would be in violation of the Clean Air Act.The banking of credits inherently raises questions about the future valueof credits and credit life. Emission credits for banking are generated,and environmental benefits accrue when in-use emissions are below the emissionstandard. The potential benefits are at their greatest when the low-emittingengine is first placed in service. However, as the vehicle ages and accumulatesmiles, the amount of potential reduction in emission levels (``credit production'')decreases, until the engine is ultimately scrapped and no further reductionin in-use emissions occurs. In addition, since vehicles are normally usedless with age, the remaining amount of reduction in in-use emissions decreaseseach year. In order for emissions to average to an acceptable in-use level, it ispreferable that the credit generating and credit-using engines have someoverlap in their operating lifetimes and ideally in their yearly usage.This occurs inherently with trading but not with banking. With this rationalein mind, EPA suggested limiting the life or availability of banked creditsto help ensure that the credit-generating engine is still operating whenthe credits are used. In addition, EPA also suggested the possibility ofdepreciating the value of banked credits as the engine generating thesecredits ages. Comments on these suggestions were made and will be summarizedbelow. Several commenters wanted to limit credit life to prevent long accumulationperiods followed by large-scale use which could have both adverse competitiveand environmental impacts. Limiting credit life would force manufacturersto use their credits within the allotted time frame or lose them. Somecommenters also felt that credits should be depreciated with time. Thesecommenters believed that depreciating credits with time would reduce thepossible adverse environmental effects related to banking and would encouragetheir orderly use in averaging or trading programs. Conversely, other commenters stated that, in order to maximize the manufacturersflexibility, banked credits should have an indefinite life. Futhermore,they argued that this high level of flexibility would increase the incentiveto generate emission credits which, in time, would promote advances inemission control technology. In addition, these commenters believed thatsupply and demand would prevent large accumulations of banked credits.These commenters pointed out that there is a ``holding cost'' for bankedcredits; the time value of money tends to reduce the value of banked creditsrelative to their use. Moreover, there is a ``risk premium'' inherent inretaining credits for later use_a firm cannot be sure whether credit priceswill be higher or lower in the future. Therefore, in their view, the possibilityof large-scale credit use following long accumulation periods would bevery small in the situation in question. As presented in the EPA staff paper and discussed at the aforementionedworkshop, development of the credit use rules for banking involves considerationof equity, environmental, and flexibility objectives which are somewhatconflicting. Flexibility considerations suggest no limitations on credituse are necessary, while equity and environmental concerns indicate thatsome restrictions are prudent. Fully achieving all of these objectiveswithin the scope of a banking program may not be possible, but it is importantto maximize the benefits available with full consideration to the importanceof the equity and environmental concerns. This view was taken in developingthe rationale for the banking programs proposed in Section IV below. E. Legal Issues Any regulation promulgated by EPA must be consistent with the authorityand direction provided by Congress within the relevant provisions of theClean Air Act (CAA). With regard to HDE NO<T2>X</T2> and PM emission standards, the relevant portions of the CAAare found in section 202(a)(3). Specifically, section 202(a)(3)(A)(ii)requires EPA to set an HDE NO<T2>X</T2> emission standard at a level equivalent to a 75 percent reductionfrom an uncontrolled HDGE NO<T2>X</T2> baseline. This equates to a level of 1.7 g/BHP-hr. Section 202(a)(3)(B)provides that if this standard is not achievable, then the standard forHDE NO<T2>X</T2> emissions is to be set at the level which represents the maximumdegree of emission reduction most engines can reasonably be expected toachieve in the available lead time. Such revised standards are to be tightenedevery three years, until the statutory level is reached. Revised emissionstandards are also to become effective four model years after promulgation.Under section 202(a)(3)(A)(iii), standards for HDE PM emissions are totake effect as expeditiously as practicable and are to reflect the greatestdegree of emission reduction achievable with the technology expected forthat model year. No statutory standard is established for HDE PM emissions.Clearly, these provisions contemplate technology-forcing emission standards.The Clean Air Act does not otherwise specify the content of emission standards,leaving the precise form of the standards to be determined by EPA throughrulemaking. EPA has traditionally promulgated standards that every vehicleor engine is required to meet, but the statute does not explicitly precludestandards that permit two or more vehicle models or engine families toachieve the required reductions by averaging their emissions together.EPA set the 1991 and later model year HDE NO<T2>X</T2> and PM standards as averaged standards; that is, EPA providedthat the standards could be met by offsetting the above-standard emissionsof one engine family with the below-standard emissions of another. Accordingly,engine families that emit at levels higher than the standard will stillcomply with the standard so long as the emissions from those engine families,when averaged with the emissions from other engine families, do not exceedthe standard. Moreover, EPA set the standards with averaging in mind, sothat averaging is integral to the standards themselves. As noted earlier, trading and banking are simply forms of averaging betweenmanufacturers and over time. Thus, they pose similar legal issues. Justas the statute does not explicitly address EPA's authority to allow averaging,it does not address the Agency's authority to permit banking and trading.EPA's authority to allow trading and banking, as well as averaging, consequentlydepends on whether these programs will support and be consistent with theprovisions and goals of the Act.Given the statute's technology-forcing scheme, banking and trading programsmust not undercut the stringency of already established emission standardsand must promote the achievement of the greatest degree of emissions reductionavailable now and in the future. More generally, banking and trading programsmust support and be consistent with the provisions and goals in the CAA.The commenters were split in opinions as to whether banking and tradingwould be consistent with the CAA. Some commenters believed that bankingand trading would provide manufacturers with an incentive to develop andapply new technology, since the resulting emission credits would be marketableand would therefore promote the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable.Other commenters believed that banking and trading would have the oppositeeffect. One commenter stated that banking and trading would ``greatly waterdown the emissions reduction standards'' but did not explain how this wouldhappen. Another commenter stated that the emission standards for 1991 andbeyond were so stringent that his firm would not be able to generate anycredits. Therefore, banking and trading would not provide that firm withan incentive to further reduce emissions. The commenters also referred to the decision of the U.S. Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia Circuit in<T3> NRDC</T3> v.<T3> Thomas</T3>, 805 F.2d 410 (1986). The case concerned the HDE NO<T2>X</T2> and PM standards promulgated by EPA on March 15, 1985 (51 FR10606). One issue in the case was the legality of HDE NO<T2>X</T2> and PM emissions averaging. The court rejected the specificchallenge of averaging made by one of the petitioners (whether averagingwas inconsistent with the statute's provision of NCPs) but also expressedreservations about its legality. Not surprisingly then, both sides referredto this case as support for their respective views. Additional comments concerning the legality of banking and trading werealso made. One commenter stated that section 206(a)(1) of the CAA authorizesEPA to provide for banking and trading, since new motor vehicle enginesare to be tested ``in such manner as (the Administrator) deems appropriate.''However, another commenter stated that Congress never intended or authorizedEPA to adopt banking and trading. That commenter believed that NCPs werethe Congressional solution for non-conforming engines. A third commenterstated that the availability of credits would be testimony that not allengine families achieved the maximum degree of emissions reduction achievableand that further reductions in the emission standards are therefore feasibleand needed. EPA believes the proposed HDE banking and trading programs promote thepurposes of the Clean Air Act. The proposed programs would encourage manufacturersto make emission reductions in the most expedient manner and would providethem with additional incentives to develop more efficient control technologiesand to introduce lower emitting methanol-fueled engines quickly. A bankingprogram in particular would promote achieving emissions reduction quickly.To generate future credits, engines would have to be certified at levelsbelow the emission standards. Thus, a banking program would encourage thedevelopment and expeditious use of more efficient control technology andlower-emitting methanol-fueled engines. Furthermore, any new technologydeveloped to generate emission credits could provide a basis for a laterfinding that a more stringent emission standard is feasible for the future.Since banking and trading are extensions of averaging, the court rulingon the HDE averaging program has implications for banking and trading programs.As noted earlier, the court in<T3> NRDC</T3> v.<T3> Thomas</T3> upheld the averaging program promulgated by EPA, sinceit disagreed with the petitioner's argument that averaging was inconsistentwith the statute's provision for NCPs. To the extent trading and bankingprograms do not conflict with the NCP provision, they too should survivelegal challenge on this ground. However, the court also noted another reason why averaging may not be authorizedunder the CAA. The court observed that CAA section 206, which governs certificationof vehicles for compliance with emission standards, speaks in terms of``any,'' ``a,'' or ``such'' vehicle being tested for certification purposes.It pointed out that under averaging<T3> some</T3> vehicles would not be required to comply with the standards.This practice, the court stated, appeared inconsistent with the requirementthat ``any,'' ``a,'' or ``such'' vehicle or engine be tested and requiredto comply with emission standards. At the same time, the court noted that the statutory language was ambiguous.It pointed out that the testing and certification provisions empower theAgency to test vehicles in the manner it deems appropriate, so as to conformto the prescribed standards. These provisions thus leave room for the counterargumentthat the manner of testing or the content of the standards themselves iswithin the Agency's discretion. However, the court suggested that sucha counterargument would have to overcome legislative history that appearedto indicate that Congress wanted every vehicle to meet emission standards.The court did not rule on the merits of this argument because no commenterhad raised it during the public comment period for the HDE rulemaking.It instead set out the point for the Agency's future consideration. (See805 F.2d 425.) EPA does not believe that the statutory text or legislative history citedby the court necessarily means that the CAA requires or that Congress intendedthat every vehicle or engine family emit at the same level. As the courtitself noted, the Act gives EPA broad latitude in the testing of vehiclesand, more fundamentally, in the formulation of standards. EPA promulgatedthe HDE NO<T2>X</T2> and PM emissions standards as averaged standards. It thus followsthat in testing ``any'' engine for compliance with those standards, EPAmay hold particular engine families to different control levels as partof an averaged set of engine families so long as the engine families' averageemission levels meet the applicable standard. The legislative history cited by the court is not adverse to this approachto standard-setting. The passages criticize pre-1970 tests for determiningcompliance with standards based on the average emission levels of prototypevehicles and state that emissions from prototype vehicles should not beaveraged in the future. However, it is not clear from these passages whetherthe tests to which they refer involved averaging individual members ofa single vehicle model or averaging four different vehicle models. Thisdistinction is important since EPA's current averaging program and itsproposed banking and trading programs would not allow averaging withinan engine model or family but only between engine families.Other passages of the legislative history indicate that the pre-1970 testsaveraged emissions from individual members of a vehicle model to determinewhether the model met applicable standards. (<T3>See </T3>Senate Rep. No. 91-1196, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970); <T3>reprinted in </T3>1 U.S. Library of Congress, A Legislative Historyof the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, at 429.) Accordingly, the passagescited by the court should be read to forbid averaging emissions of individualvehicles within a single model. At the same time, the legislative historydoes not similarly forbid averaging emissions of different vehicle models.A thorough reading of the legislative history reveals the fundamental problemthat Congress sought to address in revising the vehicle testing provisions:degradation of emission controls from prototype to production to in-usevehicles. Studies before Congress at the time the Act was being amendedshowed that while prototype vehicles generally met applicable standards,production and in-use vehicles often did not. To ensure that emission reductionsdemonstrated by prototype vehicles were realized in practice, Congressauthorized production-line testing of vehicles (section 206(b)), requiredmanufacturers to warranty vehicles for compliance with emissions standardsthroughout their useful life (section 207(a)), and provided for recallof noncomplying in-use vehicles (section 207(c)). EPA's averaging program and proposed banking and trading programs respectthe Congressional scheme for ensuring that vehicle emission controls performas designed. Manufacturers would be required to designate for each enginefamily involved in the programs a family emission limit (FEL), such thatFELs average to the level  of the applicable standard. Each engine withineach family involved in the programs would then be required to meet thefamily emission level (FEL) for its family. Accordingly, production-lineand in-use testing would determine whether  every engine involved in theprograms was meeting its FEL. Similarly, every engine involved in the programswould be  warrantied to meet its FEL. The proposed programs would thuspreserve Congress' goal of realizing the emissions reductions demonstratedby prototype vehicles. In short, EPA considers the legislative history cited by the court no barto averaging, trading or banking. On the contrary, the Agency believesthat its averaging and proposed trading and banking programs accommodateCongressional intent as expressed in the legislative history. In any event,Congress granted EPA discretion in formulating standards and test procedures,and thus it is not necessary to find explicit authorization to promulgatebanking and trading programs. As discussed above, the relevant inquiryis whether trading and banking are consistent with the goals and intentexpressed in other applicable portions of the Act. EPA also agrees that, like averaging, banking and trading would provideanother way besides payment of NCPs for engines to meet emission standards.However, like averaging, banking and trading would not obviate the needfor NCPs. A manufacturer unable to obtain credits either from his own fleetor from a competitor may have no choice but to pay NCPs for his enginesthat cannot meet a standard. The court decision to uphold averaging restedin part on its finding that averaging did not make NCPs superfluous. Moreover,trading would accomplish one of the express goals of the NCP provision_toremove any competitive disadvantage from complying manufacturers_sincethe price of credits would reflect the economic cost of obtaining the standardtechnologically. Banking and trading programs would also be useful even if all engines couldcomply with the baseline emission standard. Banking and trading programswould allow manufacturers to optimize their emission control strategies,thereby reducing costs. EPA is statutorily required to consider costs inthe design of its mobile source regulatory programs, and the provisionof banking and trading to cut cost logically follows from that requirement.EPA disagrees with the assertion that the availability of credits wouldimply that all engine families did not achieve the maximum technologicallyfeasible limit. As required by the CAA, emission standards are to be setat the lowest level practicably achievable with the technology available,considering factors such as fuel economy, cost, etc. Within those constraints,EPA sets emission standards at levels which most families are expectedto be able to meet, given the technology available or expected to be availableby the effective model year. In at least two situations, all engines could be meeting a standard basedon ``maximum feasible reductions,'' and yet emission credits could be generated.First, engines have somewhat different emission characteristics. SinceEPA sets standards based on what most engines can achieve, some may becapable of achieving greater emission reductions than required by the standard,while, for others, it may be difficult to just meet the standard. Second,some manufacturers may develop improved or new emission control technologywhich surpasses that projected to be available when the emission standardswere promulgated. These developments could provide the opportunity to generateemission credits. In both of these situations the maximum reductions judgedfeasible at the time the emission standard was promulgated would be achieved.If improved or new control technology is used to generate emission credits,it may provide the technical basis for a more stringent standard in thefuture. Banking and trading may even provide the incentive for such developments.To the extent that banking and trading programs encourage new technology,these programs promote the purposes of the CAA. The proposed banking and trading programs discussed below are workable,should not result in increases in nationwide or local emissions, and shouldhave no adverse equity or competitive effects. In addition, no aspect ofeither program is explicitly prohibited by the CAA. Trading and bankingprograms encourage manufacturers to develop and implement more efficientcontrol technologies which could reduce overall costs and serve as thetechnological basis for more stringent emission standards in the future.Thus, EPA believes the programs as structured are consistent with and promotethe goals of the Clean Air Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Description of the Proposal and Rationale </ITAG>EPA has carefully evaluated the issues raised and comments received thusfar regarding banking and trading. In light of these comments, EPA hasdeveloped the proposed programs that are described below together withthe rationale for their design. In some areas of the proposed programs,it appears that increased program flexibility might be possible. However,EPA lacks the technical data to propose such increased flexibility. Alongwith the proposal, the Agency has provided alternatives that would increaseprogram flexibility. If EPA obtains information sufficient to support promulgationof these alternatives, it may include them in the final rule. The criteria applied in formulating the proposed programs were essentiallythe same as those laid out in EPA's September 1986 Staff Paper. In summary,these criteria are: (1) The programs should not cause adverse air qualityeffects either nationwide or locally; (2) the programs should not causeadverse equity or competitive effects; (3) the programs must be workableand practical to implement and enforce for both EPA and the industry; (4)the programs should be consistent with the Clean Air Act and promote itsgoals; and (5) consistent with the first four criteria, the programs shouldbe as flexible as possible to maximize economic efficiency and enhancecompetition. These general principles guided EPA in the development of the existingemission averaging programs and were the basis for the restrictions thatwere established in those programs. EPA believes that these restrictionsare warranted and do not significantly detract from the utility of averaging.Therefore, EPA also believes that, in most cases, these restrictions shouldbe continued in any potential banking and/or trading programs. However,in view of the desire to maximize the manufacturers' flexibility and topromote the use of alternative-fueled engines, several additional provisionsare being proposed for ``expanded'' averaging, trading, and banking programs.The following discussion describes in detail the proposed banking, trading,and expanded averaging programs, along with the rationale for each decision.The discussion is broken into seven subsections: Definitions; Program Structure;Credit Use; Credit Calculation; Certification, Compliance and Enforcement;Banking; and NCP Interactions. Comments concerning the proposed banking,trading, and expanded averaging programs, along with the alternatives,are requested. A. Definitions To help to define the proposed programs and to clarify which heavy-dutyengines would be allowed to average, trade, and bank, two new phrases needto be defined. These new definitions are contained in andSection; 86.090-2of the proposed regulations.\11\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Other phrases for averaging, trading and banking arealso defined in andSection; 86.090-2. A ``heavy heavy-duty engine'' (HHDE) category would be established to includeall heavy-duty engines that are intended for vehicles that exceed a 33,000lbs gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). The phrase ``averaging set'' would be established to indicate a subcategoryof heavy-duty engines among which averaging and trading of emission creditswould be allowed. Other key terms used in describing the proposed programs are already definedin Subpart A of 40 CFR Part 86, as are many of the abbreviations used.Many of the acronyms used here were also defined in Section II of thisnotice.  B. Proposed Program Structure The proposed ``averaging sets'' will be discussed according to vehiclecategory. A discussion of possible alternative structures will then follow.The proposal and alternative structures include all HDDEs, HDMEs, and HDGEs.Inclusion of HDEs using other fuels will be considered in the future asfederal emission standards are developed for them. References will be madeto Figure 2, which shows the proposed sets for averaging and trading ofNO<T2>X </T2>credits, and to Figure 3, which shows the proposed sets foraveraging and trading of PM credits. The figures characterize engines byengine cycle and fuel type versus the subclass or GVW rating. Urban busengines are in a separate category in Figure 3. In both figures, each typeof hatched boxes represents a given averaging set.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 084-085</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C  </ITAG>As in the existing averaging program, HDEs certified under the Californiaemission control program are to be treated separately from HDEs sold inthe other 49 states and are not eligible to either generate or use emissionscredits. Also, HDEs certifying as light-duty trucks under andSection; 86.085-1(b)of 40 CFR Part 86 would be excluded from the proposed HDE banking and tradingprograms. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Urban Bus Engines </ITAG>Heavy-duty engines (HDE) used in urban buses are unique in that they aredesigned for and operate mostly in urban environments. They therefore becomea special concern in the discussion of HDEs, because their operation hasdirect local air quality impacts. EPA is especially concerned with urbanparticulate levels. In its 1985 HDE rulemaking EPA found that urban busesmake a significant and disproportionate contribution to total urban particulateloading. In comparison, NO<T2>X </T2>emissions in urban areas posed a less acute problem than particulateemissions. In light of these facts, EPA excluded urban buses from PM averagingbut not from NO<T2>X </T2>averaging. EPA also believed that a separate PM averaging classfor urban buses would be of limited usefulness since it was consideredunlikely that bus emissions could be reduced significantly below the 0.10g/BHP-hr standard.EPA is still very concerned with urban particulate levels. EPA also believesthat urban bus HDMDEs may help provide a long-term solution to the reductionof overall particulate levels. While EPA could continue to require everyurban bus engine to meet the upcoming 0.10 g/BHP-hr PM standard, the Agencybelieves that greater reductions could eventually be made by allowing alternative-fueledurban bus engines to be introduced into the market. EPA believes that averaging,trading and banking programs are a viable way to encourage the introductionof these engines. Therefore, as shown in Figure 3, EPA proposes to createa separate averaging set for urban buses with the allowance of cross-fuelPM credit exchanges within the diesel cycle (<T3>i.e.</T3>, methanol- and petroleum-fueled diesel engines). This isa change in policy. EPA believes this new provision would promote the useof alternative-fueled engines, such as methanol, in urban bus engines.However, in a manner similar to the existing averaging program, EPA isnot proposing to treat urban bus engines separately from other HDEs withinthe proposed NO<T2>X</T2> averaging, trading, and banking programs. Since urban bus PM averaging, trading, and banking for diesel-cycle HDEsis being proposed for the first time, EPA must also propose a ceiling abovewhich no family may be certified. EPA proposes a ceiling of 0.25 g/BHP-hr,the standard applicable to other HDEs beginning in the 1991 model year.This ceiling taken with the 0.10 g/BHP-hr standard applicable to urbanbuses would assure stringent control of urban bus PM emissions, even withthe flexibilities allowed by averaging, trading, and banking. EPA doesask for comment concerning the level of the urban bus engine FEL ceiling.Under the current certification protocol, there is no requirement to treaturban bus engines differently from any other HDEs or even to identify individualfamilies or configurations as urban bus engines. This will change in 1991when urban bus engines become a unique HDE subclass/averaging set in associationwith the new urban bus PM standard and averaging and trading programs.However, banking of PM credits for the urban bus PM standard would be availablein 1990, and there must be a way to distinguish those 1990 model year urbanbus engines which are generating PM credits toward the 1991 standard. Tomeet this requirement, EPA is proposing that 1990 model year urban busengines generating PM credits under the banking program be placed in separateengine families. This requirement would continue in 1991 and later modelyears since urban buses would constitute a separate subclass/averagingset when the PM standard takes effect. However, for useful life purposesurban bus engines would still need to be designated as light, medium orheavy based on their primary intended service application. This is describedin 40 CFR 86.090-2. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Petroleum-fueled Heavy-duty Diesel Engines (HDDEs) </ITAG>As discussed in Section III of today's proposal, EPA is concerned thatcross-subclass credit exchanges (<T3>i.e.</T3>, between LHDDEs, MHDDEs, and HHDDEs) would adversely effectthe environment and competition. Although cross-subclass trading and averagingwould make possible greater manufacturer flexibility and economic benefits,EPA cannot implement such an approach unless it finds such effects wouldnot occur or could be avoided. For example, better data regarding the subclasses'useful lives and appropriate urban fractions are needed to characterizeany potential problem or identify a solution. Therefore, similar to theexisting HDE NO<T2>X</T2> and PM averaging programs, EPA proposes to allow averaging andtrading within each of the three subclasses, but not between them, as shownin Figures 2 and 3. A possible alternative structure which would allowcross-subclass credit exchanges is described later in the proposal section.EPA examined the issue of cross-cycle and cross-fuel credit exchanges tosee if allowances could be made here. First, EPA considered the possibilityof designing the proposed programs to include credit exchanges betweenHDEs using different engine cycles (diesel, Otto). However, in most cases,the resulting environmental and equity complications prevented a cross-cycleallowance from being proposed. More specifically, the emission and usecharacteristics between diesel- and Otto-cycle are different enough toforce the prohibition of credit exchanges in most situations. Second, withregard to credit exchanges between like-cycled engines of different fueltypes (petroleum, methanol), the emission and use characteristics are anticipatedto be similar as was previously discussed. EPA therefore proposes to allowmanufacturers to average and trade NO<T2>X</T2> and PM credits between HDDEs and HDMDEs within the same subclass.This approach would also promote the use of lower PM emitting methanol-fueledengines. EPA is proposing one exception to the provision prohibiting cross-cycleexchanges. That is, proposing that engines within the new HHDE subclassbe permitted to exchange NO<T2>X</T2> credits. At present, HHDEs are mostly petroleum-fueled dieselengines, with only one-half of a percent of the sales being gasoline-fueledOtto-cycle engines. The low sales levels for these engines suggest thatany environmental or equity impacts of cross-cycle exchanges would be extremelysmall. Nevertheless, a slight increase in flexibility would occur for theHHDE manufacturers, and development of alternative fueled HHDEs could bepromoted. At the same time, EPA recognizes that since the HDE NO<T2>X</T2> standard is based on the maximum feasible reductions that dieselengines can accomplish, allowing exchanges between HHDGEs and HHDDEs couldeffectively relax the standard in terms of it being technology forcingfor HHDDEs. There is also a concern that if manufacturers promote the useof gasoline-fueled Otto-cycle HHDEs at the expense of petroleum-fueleddiesel-cycle HHDEs to gain NO<T2>X</T2> credits, an overall increase in HC and CO emissions would result.Accordingly, if there is a significant shift to gasoline-fueled HHDEs inorder to obtain NO<T2>X</T2> credits, EPA will consider limiting this flexibility. This proposalapplies only to NO<T2>X</T2> credit exchanges. This proposal does not provide for cross-cycleexchanges of PM credits since there are no PM standards or test proceduresfor Otto-cycle engines. However, the Agency is interested in comments onthe need for such a program and on ways to implement a program allowingaveraging, trading, and banking of PM credits. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Gasoline-fueled Heavy-duty Otto-cycle Engines (HDGEs) </ITAG>HDGEs are presently required to meet NO<T2>X</T2> emission standards but not PM emission standards. Therefore,in the existing averaging program, HDGEs are allowed to participate onlyin NO<T2>X</T2> averaging. Since no HDGE PM standards are proposed, this NO<T2>X</T2>-only structure is being kept in today's proposal. Consistent with the present averaging program, EPA proposes to allow HDGEsto trade NO<T2>X</T2> credits with other HDGEs. Since HDGEs and HDMOEs have the similaremission characteristics (high HC and CO, low NO<T2>X</T2> and PM), and EPA anticipates that they will have similar applicationsand use characteristics, EPA also proposes to allow HDGEs to trade andaverage NO<T2>X</T2> credits with HDMOEs. For the environmental and equity reasonsdescribed in Section III, cross-cycle NO<T2>X</T2> exchanges with diesel HDEs are not proposed, with the exceptionof HHDEs. In addition, referring to the footnote in Figure 2, for each Otto-cycleheavy heavy-duty engine family participating in the NO<T2>X</T2> programs, the manufacturer must state at certification whetherthe NO<T2>X</T2> credits generated by that family will be used with other heavyheavy-duty engines or with non-heavy heavy-duty Otto-cycle engines. Simultaneouscredit exchanges with both other heavy heavy-duty engine families and non-heavyheavy-duty Otto-cycle engines will not be allowed. This will eliminatethe possibility of one or more manufacturers circumventing the restrictionswithin the averaging and trading programs through multiple credit exchanges.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Methanol-fueled Heavy-duty Engines (HDMEs) </ITAG>Methanol-fueled heavy-duty engines are unique in that they can be designedfor either the diesel- or Otto-cycle. Since these cycles result in differentemission characteristics, HDMEs are treated as either HDMDEs or HDMOEs,and each category is subject to different emission standards. In the existingaveraging program, HDMDEs may not average with HDMOEs. EPA is not planningto change this general approach as it is consistent with the restrictionsfor HDDEs and HDGEs. EPA is proposing trading and banking for HDMEs, butonly between engine families using the same combustion cycles. The exceptionto this will be discussed later. Cross-subclass credit exchanges betweenHDMDEs would still be prohibited as they are for HDDEs. As noted above, HDMDEs and HDMOEs have diffent emission characteristicsdue to the differences in combustion cycles. However, because of a similarityin combustion cycles, HDMDEs and HDDEs both emit relatively high NOx andPM and low HC and CO, while HDMOEs and HDGEs both emit relatively highHC and CO and low NOx and PM. Due to these likenesses in emission characteristicsand the anticipation that HDMDEs and HDMOEs would compete with and replaceHDDEs and HDGEs, respectively (<T3>i.e.</T3>, similar applications), EPA is proposing to allow HDMDEsto average and trade with HDDEs (within the same subclass) and to allowHDMOEs to average and trade with HDGEs. Without creating environmentalcomplications, this provision would provide greater flexibility for allmanufacturers, which, in turn, would create an incentive for developmentand marketing of HDMEs. As previously mentioned, methanol-fueled diesel-cycle urban bus engineswould be allowed to exchange PM credits with petroleum-fueled diesel-cycleurban bus engines. EPA is also proposing to allow cross-fuel exchangesof NOx credits between all methanol-, diesel-, and gasoline-fueled HHDEs.These exchanges could be made regardless of whether the engine uses anOtto or diesel combustion cycle. As before with HDGE families, a manufacturer of heavy HDMOE engine familiesparticipating in averaging, trading,<T3> and</T3> banking programs would have to state at certification whetherthe family would be exchanging NOx credits with other HHDEs or with non-heavyHDMOEs and HDGEs. Simultaneous credit exchanges with both other heavy heavy-dutyengine families and non-heavy HDMOEs and HDGEs engine families would notbe allowed. This would eliminate the possibility of one or more manufacturerscircumventing the averaging and trading program restrictions through multiplecredit exchanges. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Alternative Structure </ITAG>EPA recognizes that increased flexibility and economic benefits could potentiallybe obtained if some form of cross-subclass averaging and trading were allowedfor HDDEs and HDMDEs. However, cross-subclass averaging and trading arenot being proposed due to concerns that they could result in adverse environmentaland equity effects. The following paragraphs discuss both the environmentaland the equity concerns in detail. First, in terms of environmental concerns, as previously discussed in SectionIII, HDDEs (and presumably future HDMDEs) in different subclasses differwidely in urban usage fractions, useful life periods, rebuild practicesand emission characteristics, and usage and operating patterns (load/speedprofiles, etc.). All of these characteristics would affect the lifetimeNOx and particulate emissions from these engines. If cross-subclass credit exchanges were allowed under averaging and trading,then a new method would have to be developed to account for the full rangeof differences in vehicle/engine usage and the consequent variations inemissions. As previously discussed, credits could be multiplied by proratingfactors that would ``normalize'' credits to a common base. A separate factorcould be used for each area of concern, and these could all be combinedinto one overall prorating for each of the possible subclass averaging/tradingcombinations. Unfortunately, EPA lacks sufficient data to adequately oraccurately determine the values needed for the prorating factors. EPA does have some limited data on average urban usage patterns in a givensubclass. Based on these data, the average ratio of urban to total milesis about 0.64 for LHDDEs, 0.52 for MHDDEs, and 0.30 for HHDDEs. Becauseof this wide range in urban usage, two separate credit checks would haveto be made for each cross-subclass transaction: an urban credit check anda total credit check. The manufacturer (engine family) supplying creditswould have to provide credits sufficient to cover the receiving enginefamily's overall, as well as urban, emission deficit. Due to the differencesin urban usage, cross-subclass transactions would usually result in ``extra''credits being supplied in either the urban or total credit category. Moreover,while a methodology to account for urban usage factors might be possible,currently available data are insufficient to establish the accuracy ofthese typical fractions. In addition, it cannot be known how representativethese urban usage factors would be of the vehicles participating in averaging,banking, and trading. This is especially a concern since the urban fractioninformation now available is based on average values, and nothing is knownof the distribution around the average value. Since the trading program,like the averaging program, would be voluntary, it is not known whetherparticipating engine families would be representative of the typical fractions.The uncertainty caused by voluntary participation and lack of detaileddata also applies to exchanges between engine families with different usefullife periods. Within a subclass, the actual useful lives of the participatingengine families are at least approximated by the subclass useful life valuespecified in emission regulations. Thus, a cross-subclass restriction largelyavoids the possibility of averaging engines with dissimilar useful lives.However, if cross-subclass exchanges were permitted, the possibility thatthe actual useful lives of the participating families would not be representativeof the subclass useful life values prescribed in the regulations couldcause emission increases. For example, although the data are limited, usefullives can vary from 85,000 to 195,000 miles for non-sleeved engines (LHDDEsand some MHDDEs) and from 123,000 to 308,000 miles for sleeved engines(HHDDEs and some MHDDEs).\12\<NOTE/> One report stated that trucks used specifically for long-hauldriving run 37 percent longer before overhaul than do other trucks. \13\<NOTE/> This report also stated that diesel engines in large fleetsrun 9 percent longer before overhaul than diesel engines in small fleets.With such large variations in useful lives, ensuring that the ``average''in-use emissions from cross-subclass trading (and averaging) would notexceed those anticipated by the emission standards becomes difficult. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ ``Diesel Engines,'' <T3>Fleet Maintenance andamp; Specifying</T3>; May 1981; p. 39-44. This documentis available in Docket No. A-81-11. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ ``A Study to Determine Engine Rebuild Criteria AmongOwners of Diesel Powered Vehicles,'' Survey Data Research, Inc.; May 10,1981. This document is available in Docket No. A-81-11.Closely related to the useful life concern are a number of questions regardingrebuilds. How does rebuilding affect engine emissions? How does rebuildingaffect engine life? How often are HDDEs rebuilt before being scrapped,at what intervals and what percent of HDDEs are rebuilt? Rebuild data isextremely limited. EPA knows of no data on the rebuild emission characteristicsof HDDEs certified on the transient test procedure; and, of course, predictingthe rebuild emission characteristics of HDDEs and HDMDEs certified to the1991 NOx and PM standards is problematic at best. In the <T3>Fleet Maintenance andamp; Specifying</T3> report cited above, the numberof non-sleeved HDDEs rebuilt varied from 48 to 81 percent (depending onengine owner/application), and the miles after overhaul ranged from 64,000to 162,000. While it is believed that almost all sleeved HDDEs are rebuiltat least once (essentially all HHDDEs and some MHDDEs), the miles afterrebuild range from 97,000 to 268,000. However, EPA has no information onthe percentage or frequency of rebuilds for any HDDEs after the first rebuild.Thus, it is quite difficult to develop prorating factors to address rebuiltengine emission effects. Usage patterns also vary between vehicles. The CAPE21 data used to developthe transient test cycle indicated that, as expected, differences do existin revolutions per minute, power, and speed characteristics between HDDEsoperated in urban areas.\14\<NOTE/> The mean percent revolutions per minute of a mean trip canrange from 16 percent to 84 percent when comparing New York non-freewaytravel to Los Angeles freeway travel, respectively. The mean percent powerof a mean trip can range from 16 percent to 55 percent for these same categories.Once again, since averaging and trading would be voluntary, ensuring thatthe emission values determined from the HDDE test cycle would representtypical in-use operation from participating engines would be difficult.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ ``Summary and Analysis of Comments to the NPRM: 1983and Later Model Year Heavy-duty Engines Proposed Gaseous Emission Regulations;''Table A-7; December, 1979. This document is available in Docket No. A-80-18.Thus, at present, EPA lacks sufficient data to propose prorating factorsrequired to ensure that environmental degradation would not occur fromcross-subclass credit exchanges. Presently, there is no data availablefor HDMDEs. Comments and additional data on these issues are requested.Another area of concern from cross-subclass credit exchanges is the possibilityof adverse equity effects. One manufacturer has commented that any formof averaging, trading, and banking is inequitable because different manufacturerswould benefit to different degrees from the flexibility the programs wouldprovide. It follows that allowing cross-subclass exchanges would increasethe flexibility for firms with diverse product lines, since they couldnow average or trade across subclasses, and, therefore, would increasethe range of potential benefits available to them. The flexibility of allmanufacturers would be increased under cross subclass averaging and trading.However, from the commenter's perspective, although their total flexibilitywould also increase, smaller manufacturers would have less flexibilitythan larger firms since they could not average across subclasses (onlytrade) and, therefore, would gain fewer benefits. This commenter couldargue the potential for large manufacturers to benefit more than smallmanufacturers if large manufacturers have an institutional preference foraveraging over trading (since smaller firms could not take advantage ofbanking and trading programs due to credits being unavailable for purchase).In this scenario (preferential use of cross-subclass averaging by largefirms), allowing cross-subclass exchanges would negate the benefits forsmall firms that the addition of a trading program to the present averagingprogram could provide. The disparity in market shares was previously shown in Figure 1. In summary,it showed that 70 percent of the firms each have less than one percentof the entire HDDE market, while twenty percent of the firms each haveover 10 percent of the market. Consequently, to the extent the concernsexpressed above are valid, small shifts in market shares could have extremelyadverse economic impacts for many of the smaller manufacturers. Since equityconcerns can not be addressed through prorating, other methods of ensuringequity may need to be implemented. EPA is requesting comments on the equityeffects of cross-subclass exchanges and possible methods of addressingthe concerns. Several observations regarding the foregoing discussion can be made. Itmay be that smaller firms would incrementally benefit more from cross-subclasstrading than the larger, more diverse firms; <T3>i.e.</T3>, the degree of flexibility afforded the less diverse firmsmay be proportionately more than for larger firms. If there is institutionalresistance by larger manufacturers to trade with the less diverse manufacturers,the smaller firms would have an incentive to trade among themselves togain a relative advantage, (assuming credits are available.) It is alsoworth noting that any institutional resistance to trade by a larger firmcould become an expensive policy, insofar as the price of traded creditstended to exceed the firm's value in internal use. In light of these arguments,it is not clear that cross-subclass trading would necessarily have adverseequity effects, but there is cause for concern. EPA has studied the cross-subclass issue in-depth and has developed twopossible approaches: 1. Keep the proposal as now structured (no cross-subclass exchanges). Thisapproach is the easiest to implement and given the available data appearsto address environmental and equity concerns. However, if this approachis promulgated, EPA would still consider revising the programs in the futureto allow cross-subclass exchanges when more and better information becomesavailable.2. Control the potential adverse environmental and equity effects of cross-subclasscredit exchanges to the greatest degree possible. Adverse environmentaleffects could be minimized by deriving prorating factors with appropriatemargins of safety to address the useful life, urban usage, rebuild, usage/operatingpattern concerns, and other uncertainties. In addition, total and urbancredit balances may need to be calculated and checked. Equity concernscould possibly be addressed by constraints on cross-subclass credit exchanges.Three possible approaches include: (a) Do not allow cross-subclass averaging(but do allow cross-subclass trading) as discussed in Section III; (b)allow one way trading across subclass (but do not allow cross-subclassaveraging); or (c) require a given amount of credits to be traded for everycredit averaged (<T3>e.g.,</T3>(1:1)). At this point EPA is proposing the no cross-subclass approach. However,EPA is requesting comments on these and any other approaches, includingthe detailed and comprehensive data needed to develop the prorating factors;and EPA is also seeking comment on acceptable trading-to-averaging ratios.If mechanisms can be developed to ensure that adverse equity and environmentalimpacts would not occur, then EPA will consider incorporating these mechanismsand this approach into the final rule. Finally, as was mentioned above, EPA is proposing to allow NO<T2>X </T2>averaging for all HHDEs and is proposing for the first timePM credit exchanges for diesel-cycle urban bus engines. Given the generalenvironmental, equity, and flexibility guidelines provided in the discussionat the beginning of Section III above, EPA had considered allowing cross-fueland cross-cycle PM emissions averaging, trading, and banking for HHDEsand urban buses in a similar structure as is now proposed for NO<T2>X</T2>. However, these provisions are not contained in today's noticedue to the lack of applicable PM emission standards and test proceduresfor Otto-cycle engines. EPA seeks comment on these possible additionalaveraging, trading, and banking provisions and the issue of promulgatingPM emission standards, test procedures, etc. for Otto-cycle engines toallow cross-cycle PM credit exchanges. C. Credit Use Emission credits could be averaged, traded, and banked in accordance withthe restrictions described in this notice. Banked credits would have tobe used in the averaging set where generated and could be redeemed forsingle family use, averaging, or trading, either at initial certificationor during recertification for HDEs produced following a SEA failure. Usingemission credits to compensate for previously produced non-complying enginesidentified as a result of SEA or for in-use failures (<T3>i.e.</T3>, recall) would not be allowed. D. Credit Calculation This section describes what a credit is and how EPA proposes to calculateit. The approach is similar to that of the existing HDE averaging programin that it would use family emission limits (FELs). Manufacturers electingto participate in the banking and trading programs would determine, priorto production, emission limits for each engine family to be produced ina given model year. Each limit would have the same relationship to a particularengine family as emission standards currently have to all engine familiestaken as a whole. The criteria used to distinguish engine families wouldbe the same as those currently in effect in the HDE averaging program andare summarized below. For each engine family participating in averaging, trading, or bankingthrough credit generation or credit use, the FELs would be set by the manufacturerat levels not greater than a ceiling, above which no engine family wouldbe certified. The FEL is to be specified to 0.01 g/BHP-hr precision forparticulate and to 0.1 g/BHP-hr for NO<T2>X</T2>. The ceiling values are set by EPA and can be found in sectionsof the applicable regulations which specifiy the emission standards. In the existing HDE averaging program, all engine families within a givenaveraging set essentially have the same useful life since only HDEs withinthe same subclass can be averaged together. With today's proposal, enginefamilies within a given averaging set may have different useful lives,(<T3>i.e.</T3>, Otto-cycle versus diesel-cycle  HHDEs). Therefore, in orderto average or trade credits, the credits must be based on the total massof emissions generated during the families' useful life. EPA is thereforeproposing to eliminate the equation used in the existing HDE averagingprogram and to replace it with one equation that would be used in all ofthe HDE averaging, trading, and banking programs. The equation would be used to calculate the amount of credits that areavailable or required for averaging, trading, and banking. The credit calculationwould be made for <T3>each</T3> participating engine family using the emission ``delta''between the emission standard and the FEL. FELs above the standard wouldresult in negative credit values, indicating that emission credits arerequired in order to certify that family. FELs below the standard wouldresult in positive credit values, indicating that emission credits areavailable to average, bank, and/or trade. The number of credits (positiveor negative) would be proportional to the U.S. production volume.To calculate the mass of emissions generated by an engine family, a conversionfactor is required to change the emissions rate (g/BHP-hr) to a lifetimetotal mass of emissions (Mg_Megagrams). One of two equations could be usedto accomplish this. Equation (1) uses a transient-cycle conversion factor(CF), as shown below:<ITAG tagnum="26">Cr<T2>f</T2>=(Std-FEL)(CF)(UL)(Engines Produced) (10^6) (1)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">where</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Cr<T2>f</T2>=Family credits (total mass of family emissions in Megagrams)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Std=Existing emission standard in g/BHP-hr </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">FEL=Family Emission Limit in g/BHP-hr</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,i1,3,1,xl20</C>  <H1>CF</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>Transient Cycle BHP-hr </H1><H2>Equivalent Mileage of Transient Cycle</H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="26">UL=Useful life in miles (as described in Section 86.090-2 or in Section86.090-21 (f), of Subpart A of 40 CFR Part 86) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10^6=10^6 Megagrams per gram</ITAG>As shown, the conversion factor (CF) is a combination of two numbers: thework delivered (BHP-hr) during the transient cycle and the equivalent mileageof the transient cycle. The delivered work used in this equation wouldbe the same delivered work presently used to determine the emission rate(g/BHP-hr) for certification purposes. This value is engine-family specific.The equivalent mileage used for the conversion factor is 6.5 miles forthe HDDE transient cycle and 6.3 miles for the HDE Otto transient cycle.These numbers were obtained by multiplying the average speed of a chassiscycle trip (19.45 miles per hour) by the duration of the HDE transientcycles (1199 seconds for the diesel cycle, 1167 seconds for the Otto cycle).\15\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ <T3>Transient Cycle Arrangement for Heavy-duty Engine and Chassis EmissionTesting, </T3>EPA Report HDV-78-04, August 1978. This document is availablein Docket No. A-87-03. Complication arises when choosing a conversion factor for an engine familywith two or more configurations, chosen by EPA for testing (as describedin 40 CFR 86.085-24). In the current 1991 averaging program, a production-weightedaverage of the conversion factors is used to determine compliance withthe emission standards. A similar approach is proposed for banking andtrading. However, this approach involves a degree of complication, sincethe emission credits would be initially based on projected sales in twocases_in calculation of the total credits (from the above equation) andin the determination of the conversion factor_neither of which would besettled until the end of the model year with actual production numbers.Thus, for engine families with  more than one configuration EPA asks forcomment on basing the conversion factor on one of the following possiblealternatives and asks for additional suggestions: (1) The highest sales configuration (based on projections which would haveto be verified), (2) The configuration with the highest brake specific fuel consumption,(3) The configuration with the highest emission certification level, (4) The configuration with the highest conversion factor when the enginefamily needs credits and the lowest conversion factor when the engine familygenerates credits. Equation (2) would use the latest EPA HDE emission rate conversion factorsused in air quality modeling (<T3>e.g.</T3>, the ``MOBILE'' programs). This equation is shown below:<ITAG tagnum="26">Cr<T2>f</T2>=(Std-FEL)(Factor)(UL)(Engines Produced)(10^6) (2)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">where</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Cr<T2>f</T2>, Std, FEL, and UL are the same as in equation (1) Factor=EPAConversion Factor in BHP-hr/mi</ITAG>At present, the EPA conversion factors are as follows: LHDDE, 0.92; MHDDE,2.07; HHDDE, 3.10; HDGE (andless;14K GVW), 0.81; HDGE (andgreater;114K GVW),1.35; HDDE (Urban Buses), 3.24; HDME, unknown. With equations (1) and (2), credits are to be calculated to the nearestone-tenth of a Megagram (0.1 Mg). Also, the value of Cr<T2>f</T2> would be positive or negative depending on the relative magnitudesof the Std and FEL terms. Positive Cr<T2>f</T2> values indicate the amount of credits available for averaging,trading and/or banking. Negative Cr<T2>f</T2> values indicate the amount of credits needed. Based upon the information presently available, EPA believes equation (1)(transient-cycle approach) is the best method of converting an emissionsrate to total emissions, since the factors would represent the particularengine family involved rather than an entire subclass. At present, EPAalso lacks adequate data to determine appropriate BHP-hr/mi factors forHDMEs, as would be required for equation (2). EPA asks for comments onboth equations and on other potential equations. The equation that EPAwill promulgate will depend on the record developed.The example below demonstrates how credits would be calculated, using equation1. If equation 2 is used, the only change would be in the conversion factor.<ITAG tagnum="84">Example </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A manufacturer wants to produce three MHDDE families that can be optimizedat different emission levels. Two families can easily meet the 1991 andlater model year 5.0 g/BHP-hr NO<T2>X</T2> emission standard, but one family can not. The manufacturertherefore wants to know if the two families that can meet the standardcould generate enough credits to average with and so bring into compliancethe higher emitting engine family. The manufacturer also wants to knowif any credits will be left to trade or bank. The manufacturer has chosenthe following FELs, has projected to produce the following number of engines,and has already tested for the work generated during the HDDE transientcycle, as shown below. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Family A: FEL=4.0 g/BHP-hr NO<T2>X</T2>; 12.8 BHP-hr; 200 engines </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Family B: FEL=6.0 g/BHP-hr NO<T2>X</T2>; 16.5 BHP-hr; 180 engines </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Family C: FEL=4.5 g/BHP-hr NO<T2>X</T2>; 11.6 BHP-hr; 150 engines </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">As previously discussed, the equivalent mileage of the heavy-dutydiesel transient cycle is 6.5 miles.

Certification, Compliance, and Enforcement This section provides a brief conceptual summary of how certification wouldwork and how compliance determinations would be made under averaging, trading,and banking. Further details on the certification process would be providedin later guidance from EPA (<T3>e.g., </T3>advisory circulars or certification format/application packets).Projected credits would be used in initial certification, but compliancewith the emission standards would be based on actual credits achieved.Compliance would be evaluated two ways: (1) Compliance of the engine familywith its FEL, and (2) Compliance of the engine family with the emissionstandard based on total emissions as calculated in these proposed programs.Enforcement actions based on a failure of the FEL would not be affectedby trading and banking. They would essentially be the same as occurringnow when a manufacturer's engine(s) fail to meet the emission standard.A discussion later in this section is specific to enforcement concerningthe changes in certification due to banking and trading. EPA has writtenthe regulatory language to include one of the proposed enforcement scenarios,but will modify this language according to whatever enforcement schemeEPA adopts. Also, if a manufacturer desires to use both credits and NCPs,it must separate their use into two families. The ``credit-using'' familymust follow the guidelines proposed in this document, while the ``NCP-using''family must follow provisions established by the current NCP program (asprovided in 40 CFR Part 86, Subpart L).As proposed, the banking and trading programs, like the averaging program,would be implemented and enforced through the certificate of conformancethat a manufacturer must obtain for each of its engine families beforethe engines in that family can be sold (section 203(a)). The certificatewould be conditioned on the manufacturer obtaining or generating the creditsneeded to bring the engine families within the averaging set into compliancewith the standard. Compliance with the conditions of the certificate, andthus with the standard, would be determined based on end-of-year reportssubstantiating how many credits were actually generated or how many creditswere needed and obtained to offset emissions above the level of the standard(as applicable). Failure to fulfill the conditions would result in thecertificate being voided <T3>ab initio</T3> for the entire engine family covered by the certificate.As to be discussed later, credits and NCPs cannot be used by the same family,but must be separated into ``credit using'' and ``NCP-using'' families.End-of-year reports for each family must be submitted separately. EPA has designed the proposed system so that the Agency could track thegeneration and use of credits as well as the use of NCPs to ensure thatthe engine families participating in the programs meet the applicable standard.Under the proposed system, manufacturers participating in any way in theaveraging, trading, or banking programs would be required to submit initialreports as part of their certification applications for each engine familyinvolved, the following information: (1) The emission limit (<T3>i.e.,</T3> the FEL) that the family is supposed to achieve; (2) thenumber of U.S. engines the manufacturer projects to produce in the relevantmodel year; (3) the number of credits the family would be expected to generateor need for the model year; and (4) how and where credits generated areto be dispersed or how and through what means the credit needs of the familyare to be met. Information required in reporting NCP activity would followthe guidelines established for that program. In addition, manufacturers participating in the trading program would berequired (for each engine family) to report on a quarterly basis theirquarterly and cumulative production for the year along with the credittransactions. These reports must be submitted to EPA (using the addressprovided below) no later than 30 days after the end of the calendar yearquarters (<T3>i.e.,</T3> March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31). Sincecertificates would be based on projected production, quarterly reportingwould be a useful tool in tracking credit balances throughout the modelyear and thus would assist in monitoring compliance. This is deemed importantfor trading since the compliance status of two or more manufacturers maybe affected. However, the Agency requests comment on this system's desirability.In the case of trading, a manufacturer whose engine families require emissioncredits to comply with an applicable standard would have to identify thesource of the needed credits and would have to include a copy of the contractof sale for the credits. If the manufacturer arranged to purchase the creditsfrom a broker, the broker would have to separately provide EPA with theidentity of the source of the credits it was arranging to sell and thecontract of sale covering those credits. The purpose of these requirementsis to allow EPA to identify the source of the credits so that the Agencymay ensure that the credits are being generated by a family in the appropriateaveraging set and be certain that the needed credits are generated. For all three programs, manufacturers would be required to submit end-of-yearreports within 30 days of the end of the model year. Quarterly and end-ofyear reports are to be sent to: Manufacturers Operations Division (EN-340F),U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC20503. As mentioned previously, engine families involved only in averaging andbanking would need to submit only initial certification and end of yearreports. Engine families involved in trading would have to submit initialcertification, end-of year, and quarterly reports as well. Figure 4 summarizes the type of information that would be required throughoutthe year for participation in these programs and presents a sample formatfor the information to be submitted by the manufacturers. This figure islargely self-explanatory and summarizes the information to be submittedand the determinations to be made by the manufacturers in the course ofthese programs. It should be noted that the quarterly reports are requiredonly for those families involved in trading.

Column Crepresents the total credits transacted and should, if reported correctly,be the sum of Columns D, E, F, and G. Column G, labeled ``Amount Reserved,''represents those credits pending designation for averaging, trading, orbanking or waiting verification for banking. Since these credits cannotbe banked until verified at the end of the year, they are ``floated'' untilthe end-of-year report. Column H, labeled ``NCPs In Use'' represents thoseNCPs used by an engine family during the model year. As previously explained,reporting of NCP use is to be separate from reporting of credit transactions.Finally, if manufacturers using a broker for credits are concerned aboutretaining anonymity, a coding system could be developed for use in columnE. As discussed further below, EPA also believes that effective enforcementof the programs would require that the source, as well as the user, ofcredits potentially be liable for noncompliance with standards that resultedfrom a shortfall in generated credits. As part of the end-of-year reportof credit transactions, each participating manufacturer would report: (1)The number of engines it had produced within the families involved in theprograms during the model year; (2) the parties and terms of any tradesin which it was involved; and (3) the amount of any banked credits it expended.Based on this information, EPA would verify what credits each manufacturerhad generated and, in light of any reported trades and withdrawals of bankedcredits, determine what, if any, credits each manufacturer could bank andwhether any credit shortfalls had occurred. The Agency would attempt tomake this determination within 60 days after receipt of the end-of-yearreports. Manufacturers wishing to bank credits could only do so after EPA had reviewedtheir end-of-year report. In the interim, credits designated for bankingwould be reserved, or ``floated,'' (as previously mentioned) and couldbe redesignated for averaging or trading. Manufacturers could still certifyengine families for the following model year using the credits declaredfor banking. Manufacturers could also arrange to trade their banked credits.However, if EPA found that the reported credits could not be verified,they would be revoked and deemed unavailable for use pending further resolutionas discussed. As is discussed in more detail in the next section (F), EPA is proposingtwo approaches to banking. Under one of these approaches credits couldbe generated and used three years before a new NO<T2>X</T2> or PM emission standard is implemented, but could only be withdrawn(for 2 years) after the point when the new standard is effective. Due toenforcement liability concerns, in years when banking is not fully available,situations may arise when a manufacturer desires to have credits verifiedbefore entering into trading transactions. A likely scenario under thiscase would be the desire to generate credits in a given model year specificallyfor use in trading during the subsequent (next) model year. To allow manufacturersthe flexibility to have credits verified before trading, if banking isnot fully available (i.e., credit deposit and withdrawal permitted), EPAis proposing that reserved credits that are generated in one model yearand specified for trading in the next model year need not be banked. Inthe end-of-model year report for each family, a manufacturer would haveto designate the amount of credits to be traded in the subsequent modelyear and these would remain reserved for use in trading only in the nextmodel year. If not used for trading they could ultimately be banked ifcredit banking is available. Otherwise, the credits would be lost afterone model year. Trade arrangements could be made openly between manufacturers or throughan independent broker. EPA would act as a recordkeeper to verify creditsand as an enforcer in case of illegal credit transactions (credit transactionsacross restricted boundaries, false credits, etc.). However, EPA does notplan to act as a credit broker. EPA may charge manufacturers an annualfee to help cover the administrative cost of the banking, trading, andaveraging programs. This fee may be in addition to the fee presently beingconsidered for traditional certification of a heavy-duty engine. With regard to enforcement, credit shortfalls that occurred because theterms of a trade were not fulfilled would raise the issue of which manufacturershould be held liable. A shortfall involving a trade could occur in a numberof ways: (1) One or both of the engine families failed to meet the applicableFEL in the production-line test; (2) an insufficient number of the enginesgenerating the credits were produced or too many of the engines needingthe credits were produced; (3) one or both manufacturers (or the broker)made an inadvertent mistake in calculating the credits it expected to generateor need; or (4) one manufacturer (or broker) fraudulently represents tothe other that it will have credits to sell. EPA believes that depending on the cause of the shortfall, one or the otheror both parties to the trade should be held liable. Where the shortfallis the result of the credit-purchasing manufacturer failing its production-linetest, producing more engines than it could cover with the credits it hadarranged with the selling manufacturer (or broker) to purchase, or makingan inadvertant calculation error, only the purchasing manufacturer shouldbe held liable. In these situations, the buying manufacturer was in controlof its compliance status, so it may be appropriately held responsible forthe shortfall. Holding the selling manufacturer also responsible, on theother hand, would likely discourage it from agreeing to sell credits. Where the shortfall is the result of the selling manufacturer failing tomeet its production-line test, producing too few engines to generate thenumber of credits it had arranged to sell, or making an inadvertant calculationerror, EPA believes that both the buying and selling manufacturers shouldbe potentially liable. In these situations, the selling manufacturer wasin control of whether the credits were generated and so may fairly be heldliable. However, EPA believes that buyers should also bear responsibility for aseller's failure to deliver, because the buyer could take steps to makesuch a failure less likely. First, buyers should arrange for trades onlywhere they are confident that the seller would be able to deliver. Buyerscould also write into the contract of sale terms that would provide greaterassurance that the credits would indeed be generated. To give buyers theincentive to take these and other steps to ensure credits are generated,EPA proposes that the buyer be held liable for shortfalls that the sellercreated except where the seller defrauded the buyer. In trades involving brokers, the Agency believes that selling manufacturersmust still be liable where they have arranged with the broker to obtaina certain number of credits and then failed to do so. To preserve the confidentialityof production and other business information, manufacturers may preferto buy and sell credits through brokers. However, to ensure the integrityof the trading program, EPA must be able to match up credit-generatingand using engine families. For this reason, EPA proposes that, where manufacturersplan to buy credits from brokers, brokers be required to inform EPA ofthe source of the credits they have agreed to sell and document the agreementto sell. At the same time, the Agency believes that sellers should notbe allowed to avoid their responsibility to generate the credits they havearranged to sell by trading through a broker. In addition, holding a brokersolely liable for a selling manufacturer's failure to deliver may be insufficientto deter such action, since there is no assurance that brokers would havethe financial resources to pay any penalties assessed. In short, brokersare more likely to be judgment-proof than are manufacturers.Where the shortfall is the result of fraud, only the defrauding party shouldbe held liable, unless the defrauding party is a broker. For the reasonsdiscussed above, EPA is concerned that the broker may not be effectivelydeterred by liability for fraudulent sales. Accordingly, where the fraudwas committed by the broker, the Agency would hold liable that party_thebuyer or seller of credits_that was in the best position to have avoidedthe fraudulent sale. EPA believes that it can most effectively enforce against both credit-buyingand -selling manufacturers by conditioning the certificates of conformityfor the credit-generating and -using engines on the generation or purchaseof credits, respectively, as arranged between the manufacturers. That is,certificates for engines needing credits would be conditioned on the generationof an adequate number of credits by a particular engine family, as agreedto by the manufacturer; certificates for engines generating credits wouldbe conditioned on the generation of credits agreed to be sold. The Agency acknowledges that manufacturers with credit-generating enginesmight not know at the time it certified those engines what it would dowith those credits. In these cases, EPA would permit manufacturers to certifywithout designating the use of the credits (<T3>i.e.</T3>, reserved). However, when the manufacturer makes arrangementsto sell the credits, it would be required to revise its certificate toinclude the condition that the engine family actually generate the creditsagreed to in the trade. More complicated liability issues would be posed where one credit-generatingmanufacturer sold to more than one manufacturer (or broker) but failedto generate enough credits to cover all its sales agreements. Buyers andsellers could agree among themselves to a particular way of distributingcredits if a shortfall occurred. However, for those cases where buyersand sellers reached no such agreement or the agreements are conflicting,EPA proposes that the buyers' liability for a shortfall in credits be apportionedas follows. Whatever credits the seller in fact generates would be apportionedaccording to the dates of the contracts; that is, the credits would beused to fulfill the contracts in the order in which the contracts weresigned. Where the contracts were signed on the same day or do not otherwiseprovide a means for prioritizing them, any credits would be distributedequally among the buyers. EPA also considered holding just the credit-buying manufacturer liableif for any reason short of fraud insufficient credits were generated tobring its engine family into conformity with the standard. This approachwould place the burden of securing the credits on the manufacturer whoseengines emit above the level of the standard, which intuitively seems appropriate.In addition, the buying manufacturer could seek to redistribute liabilityto the seller in negotiating the terms of the contract of sale for thecredits. However, EPA is concerned that it may be difficult to enforceagainst good faith buyers in every instance. (<T3>See Farmers Union Central Exchange, Inc.</T3> v.<T3> Thomas</T3>, CV87-176-DLG-JFB (D. Mont., 1987), in which a federaljudge refused to hold a good faith purchaser of lead credits liable fora violation of EPA's lead banking regulations.) Since sellers have controlover their performance of the contract terms, EPA also believes that theyshould share in the responsibility for ensuring compliance with emissionstandards. The Agency seeks comment on its suggested approach for apportioningliability in cases where traded credits fall short of what is needed tocomply with emissions standards. In any event, EPA proposes to allow manufacturers to make ``last minute''transactions between the end of the model year and the submittal of theirend-of-year report to obtain credits needed to show compliance with thestandard. This approach would permit manufacturers to correct any negativecredit balances identified after the model year has ended. However, NCPscould not be used, since production would have been terminated for thatmodel year. The Agency seeks comment on this concept. Another compliance issue is whether any exceedance of a standard as a resultof insufficient credits should result in voiding the certificate of conformityfor all of the engines in the relevant family or just for those whose productionresulted in the standard being exceeded. EPA proposes that the certificatefor all the engines in the family be voided<T3> ab initio</T3>. The trading and banking programs, along with the averagingprogram, would provide manufacturers with flexibility in meeting emissionstandards, but would also place a significant enforcement and compliancemonitoring burden on EPA. As the foregoing discussion indicates, EPA wouldhave to match and track engine families and their production from certificationto year-end reports. The Agency also would have to conduct its testingprogram in a way that would ensure that engines being averaged togetherare all meeting their respective FELs. Given this added complexity, EPAbelieves manufacturers should have the maximum incentive to ensure compliancewith emissions standards. The integrity of the averaging, banking, and trading programs and the airquality impact of these programs are dependent on the manufacturers' submittalof accurate reports as discussed above. Subsequently, EPA is responsiblefor the effective auditing of the manufacturers' practices, liability determinationsif violations are discovered, and enforcement of the resulting penalties.Failure of a manufacturer to retain the required pertinent production informationor to provide such information to EPA officials upon reasonable requestmay result in EPA voiding<T3> ab initio</T3> the certificates of conformity for those engines atissue. A violation of section 203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act will haveoccurred for each engine distributed into commerce and for which the certificateof conformity has been voided. In these cases, the manufacturer would besubject to a section 205 penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation. Pertinent information, whether kept by the manufacturer or by a contractorof the manufacturer, would be subject to auditing by EPA officials. Consequently,EPA officials would require voluntary entry and access to facilities andrecords pertaining to production as a condition of the certificate of conformity.Failure by a manufacturer or a contractor of the manufacturer, if applicable,to grant EPA officials entry and access to these facilities and recordscould result in EPA voiding <T3>ab initio </T3>the certificates of conformity for engines introducedinto commerce. A violation of section 203(a)(1) will have occurred foreach engine distributed into commerce and for which the certificate ofconformity has been voided. Once again, the manufacturer will be subjectto a section 205 penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation.Certificates of conformity under the averaging program are conditionalupon each engine family's end-of-model year net emissions (using averaged,traded, or banked credits) being at or below the applicable emission standard.The quarterly and end-of-model year reports that are required (as applicable)are critical for EPA to monitor conformance with the conditions under whichthe certificates of conformity are issued. Therefore, failure to submitthe required reports in the designated time will be considered a violationof section 203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act. Every engine produced in eachengine family which does not report for that model year will be considereda separate violation of section 203(a)(1) and will subject the manufacturerto the Section 205 penalty of up to $10,000 per violation. This proposal also includes a provision for inspection and auditing ofmanufacturers' records by an independent auditor. EPA does not have enoughinformation to assess the cost and benefits of an independent auditor andsolicits comments on this issue. Enforcement of the proposed program will include automatic retroactiveadjustments to credits. If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reportingerror occurred, whether intentionally or unintentionally, that resultsin erroneous credits being reported as generated or otherwise available,those erroneous credits will automatically and retroactively be voided,regardless of the time lag between the report and the discovery of theerror. The reporting manufacturer's end-of-year compliance will be recalculatedfor the model year at issue. If the resultant compliance level exceedsan applicable emission standard, then a determination of noncomplianceand resulting enforcement action will occur. F. Banking The design of the banking program should be a function of environmentalconcerns, competitive concerns, and manufacturer need. As discussed previouslyin Section III, from an environmental perspective it is desirable thatthere be some degree of overlap in the operation and use of credit-generatingand -using vehicles. In addition, some manufacturers suggested that maximumcredit life be limited to prevent credit hoarding. To address these concerns,banked credits need to have a limited life and possibly should be depreciatedwith time. However, strict depreciation schedules and short credit lifeperiods would reduce the economic incentive to create and bank credits.This would in turn reduce the incentive to develop cleaner engines earlier,resulting in the use of higher emitting engines for longer periods. Finally, in terms of manufacturer need, banking may be most useful to helpmanufacturers smooth the transition to tighter standards. With banking,manufacturers could make reductions in emission levels before a new standardtakes effect. These generated credits could then allow them to meet certificationrequirements as they continue to develop techniques to meet or surpassthe new standard. During periods when the standard is not changing, thedesire and need for banking would not be as great. However, there is somevalue to the increased flexibility in product planning and developmentwhich would come from a banking program which is available in every modelyear as would be the averaging and trading programs. Several different program structure characteristics can be derived fromconsideration of these three design factors. First, should a banking programbe of a more limited duration or should it be available in perpetuity asis the proposed trading program? Second, what should be the scheme forcredit generation and credit use? And third, how long after credit generationshould they be available and is depreciation needed? After consideration of the design and structure concerns, EPA is proposingtwo different approaches to the banking program and EPA plan to implementone of the two approaches with perhaps some modifications based on thecomments received. In the first approach, EPA is proposing to allow banking only during thetransition period to a tighter NO<T2>X</T2> or PM standard. In general, EPA is proposing that banking ofcredits be permitted one to three model years prior to the model year inwhich a new, more stringent emission standard takes effect and that withdrawalsbe permitted during this three-year period plus an additional two-model-yearperiod immediately after the new standard takes effect. These banked creditswould maintain full value (no depreciation) over this five-year periodbut afterward could no longer be withdrawn and used. As discussed in SectionE above, reserved credits designated for trading in the following modelyear would not be considered as part of banking. For the 1991 emission standards, the above outline cannot be followed dueto the limited time before the standards take effect. EPA is thereforeproposing to allow banking of NO<T2>X</T2> and PM credits during the 1990 model year. Credits generatedin 1990 could be withdrawn for use by 1991 and 1992 model-year engines.In the case of the 1994 emission standards EPA is proposing that PM bankingbegin in 1991 and end after the 1995 model year. Credits generated from1991 through 1993 model-year engines could be banked and withdrawn foruse by 1991 through 1995 model-year engines. Similar provisions would applyto the 1994 NO<T2>X</T2> standard once it is promulgated or to other future downwardrevisions to either the HDE NO<T2>X</T2> or PM emission standards. If in the future the period between more stringent emission standards isless than 3 years, any credits generated for banking under the first standardwould be available for use in meeting subsequent standards, consistentwith the credit life for the first standard. As a second approach EPA is also proposing a program which would allowbanking at any time, regardless of whether or not a tighter standard hasbeen promulgated. In this program, credits generated in a given model yearwould have to be used within 5 years or completely lose their value. Forexample, PM credits deposited in the 1991 model year would have to be usedby the close of the 1996 model year. Thus, this would be a continuous bankingprogram where credits would have a maximum life of 5 years. A period offive years was selected because that was the longest credit life whichwould still provide some degree of in-use overlap (age/VMT) between credit-generatingand credit-using vehicles. The question of depreciation of these creditsis discussed below.With regards to these two proposed approaches to banking EPA is seekingcomment in three areas. These include the need for a rolling banking programversus a more limited program and the relative environmental and equityimpacts, if any. Second, for both programs EPA is seeking comment on thenumber of years in which credits can be generated and used. Specifically,EPA is seeking comment on the credit life. Finally, related to credit life,EPA is seeking comment on whether credit depeciation is needed for programswhere credit life exceeds 2 or 3 years. Depreciation for credit life beyondthree years becomes an issue because at that point the VMT overlap betweencredit-generating and credit-using vehicles is less than 50 percent basedon Mobile IV data (see Figure 6 discussed later). Thus, while EPA is notproposing depreciation for the more limited approach, EPA is interestedin comments on whether some depreciation would be needed and desirablefor banking programs with a longer credit life.In addition, EPA is proposing for comment several possible depreciationstrategies as part of this second approach. These proposed depreciationstrategies are discussed below and are illustrated in Figure 5. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration 2 136</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. No Depreciation</ITAG>The first approach is to impose no depreciation schedules on credits. Bankedcredits would have full value until they are used or until they reach theirmaximum life. With no depreciation, the incentive to bank credits is maximized,but there is not necessarily a large degree of overlap in use between credit-generatingand -using vehicles. In addition, this approach promotes banking over tradingand may undermine the purpose of the trading program.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Fixed Depreciation</ITAG>The second proposal is to depreciate credits at a fixed rate. This ratecould represent a ``straight-line'' depreciation or could change accordingto a fixed schedule. This depreciation approach, by providing incentiveto use credits rather than retain them. would promote the overlap of credit-generatingand credit-using vehicles. EPA would consider a rate between 5 and 25 percentper annum or some schedule of annual values within that range, which wouldact to assure an acceptable degree of credit overlap between credit-generatingand credit-using vehicles. As stated previously, a VMT overlap of about50 percent is desirable and would be the goal under the fixed depreciationscheme.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Depreciation by VMT</ITAG>As a variation of the fixed depreciation idea, credits could be depreciatedaccording to the reduction in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) each year. Thismethod ideally matches the availability of credits with the mileage accumulationof the credit-generating vehicle and is the preferable approach since emissionsare linked to VMT. The VMT distributions which would be used by EPA arederived from the Mobile 4 emissions model, calculated to the average usefullife as prescribed in 40 CFR 86.090-2. As is shown in Figure 6, bankedcredits could undergo large depreciations during the first years and smallerdepreciations near the end of the credit life. Like Option 2, this approachwould promote vehicle overlap and provide incentives to use credits ratherthan retain them.EPA is interested in comments on all aspects of the depreciation conceptand seeks view points on the need for depreciation and data to supportpossible depreciation schedules. Based on the record developed in the commentsand further EPA analysis, EPA may adopt depreciation schedules similarin nature to those described in strategies 2 and 3 above if a rolling bankingprogram is implemented.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Figure </T4>6._<T4>HDV VMT </T4>andamp; <T4>Credit Depreciation Data \1\</T4><H1>Age</H1><H1>VMT</H1><H1>CUM MLG</H1><H1>DEPR (MI)</H1><H1>DEPR (YR)</H1><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>HDGV</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1<D>18,211</D><D>18,211</D><D>0.16</D><D>0.16 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>16,767</D><D>34,978</D><D>0.31</D><D>0.31 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3<D>15,437</D><D>50,415</D><D>0.45</D><D>0.45 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4<D>14,213</D><D>64,628</D><D>0.58</D><D>0.58 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5<D>13,086</D><D>77,714</D><D>0.70</D><D>0.70 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6<D>12,048</D><D>89,762</D><D>0.81</D><D>0.81 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7<D>11,093</D><D>100,855</D><D>0.91</D><D>0.91 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8<D>10,213</D><D>111,068</D><D>1.00</D><D>1.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>LHDDV</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1<D>23,611</D><D>23,611</D><D>0.22</D><D>0.18 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>20,947</D><D>44,558</D><D>0.42</D><D>0.35 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3<D>18,583</D><D>63,141</D><D>0.59</D><D>0.49 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4<D>16,486</D><D>79,627</D><D>0.74</D><D>0.62 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5<D>14,625</D><D>94,252</D><D>0.88</D><D>0.73 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6<D>12,975</D><D>107,227</D><D>1.00</D><D>0.83 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7<D>11,511</D><D>118,738</D><D/><D>0.92 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8<D>10,212</D><D>128,950</D><D/><D>1.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>MHDDV</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1<D>43,946</D><D>43,946</D><D>0.23</D><D>0.16 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>40,504</D><D>84,450</D><D>0.45</D><D>0.31 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3<D>37,332</D><D>121,782</D><D>0.65</D><D>0.45 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4<D>34,408</D><D>156,190</D><D>0.83</D><D>0.58 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5<D>31,713</D><D>187,903</D><D>1.00</D><D>0.70 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6<D>29,229</D><D>217,132</D><D/><D>0 81 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7<D>26,939</D><D>244,071</D><D/><D>0.91 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8<D>24,829</D><D>268,900</D><D/><D>1.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>HHDDV</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1<D>86,375</D><D>86,375</D><D>0.28</D><D>0.16 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>79,434</D><D>165,809</D><D>0.54</D><D>0.32 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3<D>73,051</D><D>238,860</D><D>0.78</D><D>0.46 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4<D>67,181</D><D>306,041</D><D>1.00</D><D>0.58 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5<D>61,782</D><D>367,823</D><D/><D>0.70 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6<D>56,817</D><D>424,640</D><D/><D>0.81 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7<D>52,252</D><D>476,892</D><D/><D>0.91 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8<D>48,053</D><D>524,9945</D><D/><D>1.00 </D><F>\1\ Since the longest credit life proposed banking program is 5 years,data for later years is presented for completeness and to assist the publicin preparation of comments on credit depreciation.</F></ITAG></ITAG>G. NCP Interactions The analysis of comments received regarding the relationship between NCPsand trading/banking has led EPA to develop three general guidelines regardingthe interactions of these programs. First, to avoid the inappropriate generationof credits, credits for banking and trading should not be generated byeither single engine families or any engine families within an averagingset where NCPs are used. Second, due to the in-engine NO<T2>X</T2>/PM trade-off, use of either a NO<T2>X </T2>or PM NCP by an engine family precludes that family from generatingeither NO<T2>X</T2> or PM credits. Third, for air quality considerations, use ofcredits is preferable to use of NCPs. Based on these guidelines, EPA is proposing the following provisions applicableto NCPs, trading, and banking. First, for the 1990 model year, single enginefamilies using either a NO<T2>x </T2>or PM NCP may not generate either NO<T2>X </T2>or PM credits for banking. This provision would apply to 1991and later model years for banking and trading. Second, for 1991 and latermodel-year engine families, if a manufacturer has any engine family ina given averaging set which is using NO<T2>X </T2>and/or PM NCPs, none of that manufacturer's engine familiesin that averaging set may generate either NO<T2>X </T2>or PM credits for banking and trading. This provision wouldapply even if the engine family involved is not included in the averagingprogram. Third, EPA is also proposing that, for any manufacturer who desiresto purchase NCPs for an engine family which has credits available for use,these available credits would be depreciated by 100 percent. The Agencyfeels that it is in the best interest of air quality that credit use bepreferred to NCP use and, thus, the depreciation of credit value wouldprovide an incentive for exhausting available credits before purchasingNCPs. The Agency seeks comment on this provision; but, also, since creditshave a limited life, comment is requested for the option of depreciatingcredit values by some lesser percentage if NCPs were desired to be used.Some uncertainty arises in the structure of a program handling NCPs andcredits as well as in the methods of introducing credits into the NCP calculation.To avoid any program design complications caused by simultaneous NCP andcredit use on a family, the following procedure in handling their treatmentis proposed. An emission family needing NCPs and credits to meet the standardwould be separated into two families. One family would strictly use credits,would be assigned an FEL, and would involve only the number of engineswhich could be certified using the credits available to lower the FEL tothe standard. The other family would strictly use NCPs to lower its certificationlevel to the standard, would be assigned an FEL equal to the standard andwould be comprised of the remainder of the engines in the original enginefamily. In this way, the manufacturer would assign the number of enginesto each family (as available credits would allow) to always ensure a loweringto the standard and, thus, to provide a means of quick remedy of any complianceproblem (since future production could be shifted to the NCP problem).The use of such a procedure necessitates the manufacturer to submit a separatereport for each family, one givlng credit transactions and the other givingNCP use. Also, to implement this approach, the use of an NCP is proposedto be an engine family criteria. This procedure may best be illustrated by showing an example of a possiblesituation which may arise. A manufacturer has 100 engines, each emitting1,000 g of NO<T2>X</T2> above the standard. Thus, a total of 100,000 g of NO<T2>X </T2>are emitted above the standard. The manufacturer has availablecredits equalling to 75,000 g of NO<T2>X </T2>and wishes to purchase an NCP for the remaining 25,000 g ofNO<T2>X</T2>. One engine family would be comprised of 75 engines and wouldbe certified using credits to lower its FEL to the standard, while theother would contain 25 engines and would employ NCPs to ``buy down'' fromits certification limit to the standard. If projected credits for the firstfamily were not gained, future production could be shifted to the NCP-usingfamily to address this problem. As part of the reporting process, the manufacturerwould submit one report for each engine family_one reporting the use ofthe 75,000 g of NO<T2>X </T2>credits (along with the other relevant data) and the other reportingthe use of the 25,000 g of NO<T2>X </T2>NCPs. As discussed in Section III, the provisions for the interaction of creditsand NCPs discussed above, would promote the use of credits over NCPs whenpossible, and would prevent manufacturers from circumventing the intentof the NCP program by generating credits for profit via the purchase ofan NCP. EPA asks for comment on these provisions. Further details on theinteraction between NCPs and the HDE banking, trading, and averaging programswill be worked out in the Phase III NCP rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Statutory Authority </ITAG>EPA has broad authority under sections 202, 206(a)(1), 207, 208, and 301(a)of the Clean Air Act to formulate and implement cost-saving and technologyenhancing mobile source control programs. Promulgation of heavy-duty tradingand banking programs to complement the HDE control program is thus withinEPA's authority.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis </ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement that a Regulatory Impact Analysisbe prepared. Major regulations have an annual effect on the economy of$100 million or more or result in a major price increase. Today's bankingand trading proposal is noteworthy in that it sets forth a new conceptin emissions regulations for mobile sources. However, it is not ``major''according to the established criteria. This proposal will actually helpto reduce the cost of heavy-duty engines rather than increase their cost.Therefore, the Administrator has determined that this proposal does notconstitute a major regulation. This regulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for review as required by Executive Order 12291. Any written comments fromOMB and any EPA response to those comments are in the public docket forthis rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Compliance With Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq,</T3> the Administrator is required to certify that this regulationwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall business entities. None of the affected HDE manufacturing entitiescould be classified as a small business. Moreover, as already discussed,the banking and trading program can be expected to have salutary effectson manufacturers, both primary and secondary. Thus, I certify that thisrule will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Information Collection Requirements </ITAG>The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have beensubmitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) underthe Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information CollectionRequest document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 0783.08) and copy maybe obtained from Bryan Wood-Thomas, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401M St., SW. (PM-223); Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202) 475-8791.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 13 hours per response. This includes the time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any aspect of this collectionof information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief,Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule willrespond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirementscontained in this proposal. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 86 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedures, Air pollution control, Gasoline,Motor vehicles, labeling, Motor vehicle pollution, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: May 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.

Section 86.090-2 of Subpart A is proposed to be amended by revisingthe entire section to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 86.090-2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG>The definitions in andSection; 86.088-2 remain effective. The definitionsin this section apply beginning with the 1990 model year. ``Averaging'' for heavy-duty engines means the exchange of NO<T2>X</T2> and particulate emission credits among engine families withina given manufacturers product line. ``Averaging set'' means a subcategory of heavy-duty engines where enginefamilies can average and trade emission credits with each other. ``Banking'' means the retention of heavy-duty engine NO<T2>X</T2> and particulate emission credits, by the manufacturer generatingthe emission credits, for use in future model year certification programsas permitted by regulation. ``Composite particulate standard,'' for a manufacturer which elects toaverage light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks together in either thepetroleum-fueled or methanol-fueled light-duty particulate averaging program,means thatstandard calculated using the following equation and roundedtothe nearest one-hundredth (0.01) of a gram per mile:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,38,1,22</C> <H1>(PROD</H1><T2>LDV</T2>)(STD<T2>LDV</T2>)+(PROD<T2>LDT</T2>)(STD<T2>LDT</T2>)<H2>(PROD</H2><T2>LDV</T2>)+(PROD<T2>LDT</T2>)<H1>=</H1><H1>Manufacturer composite particulate standard</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="26">Where: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">PROD<T2>LDV</T2> represents the manufacturer's total petroleum-fueled dieselor methanol-fueled diesel light-duty vehicle production for those enginefamilies being included in the appropriate average for a given model year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">STD<T2>LDV</T2> represents the light-duty vehicle particulate standard. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">PROD<T2>LDT</T2> represents the manufacturer's total petroleum-fueled dieselor methanol-fueled diesel light-duty truck production for those enginefamilies being included in the appropriate average for a given model year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">STD<T2>LDT</T2> represents the light-duty truck particulate standard.</ITAG>``Diesel'' means type of engine with operating characteristics significantlysimilar to the theoretical Diesel combustion cycle. The non-use of a throttleduring normal operation is indicative of a diesel engine. ``Emission credits'' mean the amount of emission reductions or exceedances,by a heavy-duty engine family, below or above the emission standard, respectively.Emission credits below the standard are considered as ``positive credits,''while emission credits above the standard are considered as ``negativecredits''. In addition, ``projected credits'' refer to emission creditsbased on the projected U.S. production volume of the engine family: ``Actualcredits'' refer to emission credits based on actual U.S. production volumes.''Family emission limit'' (FEL) means the emission level to which an enginefamily is certified in any of the averaging, trading, or banking programs.FELs must be expressed to the same number of decimal places as the applicableemission standard. The FEL for an engine family using NO<T2>X</T2> or particulate NCPs must equal the value of the current NO<T2>X</T2> or particulate emission standard. ``Flexible fuel vehicle (or engine)'' means any motor vehicle (or motorvehicle engine) engineered and designed to be operated on a petroleum fuel,a methanol fuel, or any mixture of the two. ``Heavy heavy-duty engines'' mean heavy-duty engines analogous to and includingheavy heavy-duty diesel engines, regardless of the combustion cycle andfuel used. Heavy heavy-duty engines generally have a rated horsepower exceeding250. Vehicles using engines from this group are normally tractors, trucks,and buses used in inter-city, long-haul applications. These vehicles normallyexceed 33,000 pounds GVWR. ``Methanol-fueled'' means any motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine thatis engineered and designed to be operated using methanol fuel (<T3>i.e.</T3>, a fuel that contains at least 50 percent methano1 (CH<T2>3</T2>OH) by volume) as fuel. Flexible fuel vehicles are methanol-fueledvehicles. ``Non-oxygenated hydrocarbon'' means organic emissions measured by a flameionization detector, excluding methanol. ``Organic Material Hydrocarbon Equivalent'' means the sum of the carbonmass contributions of non-oxygenated hydrocarbons, methanol and formaldehydeas contained in a gas sample, expressed as gasoline fueled vehicle hydrocarbons.In the case of exhaust emissions, the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of the equivalenthydrocarbon is 1.85:1. In the case of diurnal and hot soak emissions, thehydrogen-to-carbon ratios of the equivalent hydrocarbons are 2.33:1 and2.2:1, respectively.``Otto-cycle'' means type of engine with operating characteristics significantlysimilar to the theoretical Otto combustion cycle. The use of a throttleduring normal operation is indicative of an Otto-cycle engine. ``Primary intended service class'' means: (a) The primary service application group for which a heavy-duty dieselengine is designed and marketed, as determined by the manufacturer. Theprimary intended service classes are designated as light, medium, and heavyheavy-duty diesel engines. The determination is based on factors such asvehicle GVW, vehicle usage and operating patterns, other vehicle designcharacteristics, engine horsepower, and other engine design and operatingcharacteristics. (1) Light heavy-duty diesel engines usually are non-sleeved and not designedfor rebuild; their rated horsepower generally ranges from 70 to 170. Vehiclebody types in this group might include any heavy-duty vehicle built fora light-duty truck chassis, van trucks, multi-stop vans, recreational vehicles,and some single axle straight trucks. Typical applications would includepersonal transportation, light-load commercial hauling and delivery, passengerservice, agriculture, and construction. The GVWR of these vehicles is normallyless than 19,500 lbs. (2) Medium heavy-duty diesel engines may be sleeved or non-sleeved andmay be designed for rebuild. Rated horsepower generally ranges from 170to 250. Vehicle body types in this group would typically include schoolbuses, tandem axle straight trucks, city tractors, and a variety of specialpurpose vehicles such as small dump trucks, and trash compactor trucks.Typical applications would include commercial short haul and intra-citydelivery and pickup. Engines in this group are normally used in vehicleswhose GVWR varies from 19,500-33,0000 lbs. (3) Heavy heavy-duty diesel engines are sleeved and designed for multiplerebuilds. Their rated horsepower generally exceeds 250. Vehicles in thisgroup are normally tractors, trucks, and buses used in inter-city, long-haulapplications. These vehicles normally exceed 33,000 lbs GVWR.  ``Production-weighted particulate average'' means the manufacturer's production-weightedaverage particulate emission level, for certification purposes, of allof its diesel engine families included in the light-duty particulate averagingprogram. It is calculated at the end of the model year by multiplying eachfamily particulate emission limit by its respective production, summingthose terms, and dividing the sum by the total production of the effectedfamilies. Those vehicles produced for sale in California or at high altitudeshall each be averaged separately from those produced for sale in any otherarea. ``Reserved credits'' mean actual emission credits waiting to be verifiedfor the banking program or used in the subsequent model year's tradingprogram. ``Throttle'' means a device used to control an engines power output bylimiting the amount of air entering the combustion chamber. ``Trading'' means the exchange of heavy-duty engine NOx or particulateemission credits between manufacturers. ``Useful life'' means: (a) For light-duty vehicles a period of use of 5 years or 50,000 miles,whichever first occurs. (b) For a light-duty truck engine family, a period of use of 11 years or120,000 miles, whichever occurs first. (c) For an Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine family, a period of use of 8 yearsof 110,000 miles, whichever first occurs. (d) For a diesel heavy-duty engine family: (1) For light heavy-duty diesel engines, period of use of 8 years or 110,000miles, whichever first occurs. (2) For medium heavy duty diesel engines, a period of use of 8 years or185,000 miles, whichever first occurs. (3) For heavy heavy-duty diesel engines, a period of use of 8 years or290,000 miles, whichever first occurs. (e) As an option for both light duty truck and heavy-duty engine families,an alternative useful life period assigned by the Administrator under theprovisions of paragraph (f) of andSection; 86.090-21. (f) The useful-life period for purposes of the emissions defect warrantyand emissions performance warranty shall be a period of 5 years/50,000miles whichever first occurs, for light-duty trucks, Otto-cycle heavy-dutyengines and light heavy-duty diesel engines. For all other heavy-duty dieselengines the aforementioned period is 5 years/100,000 miles, whichever firstoccurs. However, in no case may this period be less than the manufacturer'sbasic mechanical warranty period for the engine family.5.

Engines eligiblefor the NO<T2>X</T2> and particulate banking programs are described in the applicableemission standards sections in this subpart. Participation in this programis voluntary. (2) During the 1990 model year, manufacturers will only be allowed to bankNO<T2>X</T2> and particulate emission credits generated by participatingengine families. Credits may not be used for averaging or trading duringthe 1990 model year or to offset emissions that exceed an FEL. Creditsmay not be used to remedy an in-use nonconformity determined by a SelectiveEnforcement Audit or by in-use testing. (3) Credits banked in 1990 may be used singly for a given engine family,in averaging, or in trading, or in any combination thereof, during thecertification of engine families in the same averaging set and regionalcategory as the generating engine family. Engines produced for sale inCalifornia constitute a separate regional category than engines producedfor sale in the other 49 states. The averaging sets for heavy-duty enginesare defined in andSection; 86.091-15. (4) NO<T2>X</T2> or particulate emission credits generated for banking, from1990 model year heavy-duty engines must be used in the certification of1991 or 1992 model year heavy-duty engines within the constraints describedin paragraph (a)(3) of this section or NO<T2>X</T2> or particulate emission credits generated for banking from 1990model year heavy-duty engines must be used in the certification of 1991,1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995 heavy duty engines within the constraints describedin paragraph (a)(3) of this section. (b) Participation in the NO<T2>X</T2> and/or particulate banking program shall be done as follows:(1) During certification, the manufacturer shall: (i) Declare its intent to include specific engine families in the NO<T2>X</T2> and/or particulate banking programs. (ii) Declare an FEL for each engine family participating in the bankingprogram.(A) The FEL must be to the same level of significant digits as the emissionsstandard (one-tenth of a gram per brake horsepower-hour for NO<T2>X</T2> emissions and one-hundredth of a gram per horsepower-hour forparticulate emissions.) (B) In no case may the FEL exceed the applicable emission standard for1990 model-year engines. (iii) Calculate and report, as described in andSection; 86.090 23, the projectedemission credits, using the equation in paragraph (c) of this section andthe applicable factors for the specific engine family. (2) Upon certification, the manufacturer will be allowed to produce andsell engines in the certified engine family. Actual credits generated bythe production of engines will be considered reserved during the modelyear. (3) At the end of the model year, manufacturers shall submit to EPA theactual number of engines produced and the number of reserved credits, asdescribed in andSection; 86.090-23, in order to receive verification of thecredits. Once credits are verified, they may be banked for future use asdescribed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.(4) Within the restrictions of the applicable (NO<T2>X</T2> or particulate) banking program:(i) Manufacturers may indicate the intention to use reserved (unverified)credits during the certification of 1991 model year engines whose FELsexceed the emission standard. (ii) Manufacturers may indicate the intention to use banked (verified)credits during the certification of future model year engines as describedin paragraph (a)(3) of this section. (iii) The actual number of banked credits used for future model year enginefamilies will be dependent on the actual U.S. production volume of thoseengines. However, credits not used by the expiration period described inparagraph (a)(3) of this section shall be forfeited. (5) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error occurredon a report previously submitted to EPA under this section, the manufacturer'scredits and credit calculations shall be recomputed. Erroneous positivecredits will be void. Manufacturers shall be subject to the applicablepenalties for engines exceeding the emission standard due to erroneouspositive credits.(c)(1) For each participating engine family, emission credits are to becalculated according to the following equation and rounded, in accordancewith ASTM E29-67, to the nearest one-tenth of a Megagram (Mg).

For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.3miles. For diesel heavy-duty engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.5 miles.When more than one configuration is chosen by EPA to be tested in the certificationof an engine family (as described in andSection; 86.085-24), the conversionfactor used is to be based upon the (projected and then actual) production-weightedaverage of the conversion factors of all configurations tested.

The definitionslisted in this section apply beginning with the 1991 model year. ``Reserved credits'' mean actual emission credits waiting to be designatedfor use in averaging or trading, or waiting to be verified for the bankingprogram. ``Urban bus'' means a heavy-duty diesel-powered passenger-carrying vehiclewith a load capacity of fifteen or more passengers and intended primarilyfor intra-city operation, <T3>i.e.</T3>, within the confines of a city or greater metropolitan area.Urban bus operation is characterized by short rides and frequent stops.To facilitate this type of operation, more than one set of quick-operatingentrance and exit doors would normally be installed. Since fares are usuallypaid in cash or tokens rather than purchased in advance in the form oftickets, urban buses would normally have equipment installed for collectionof fares. Urban buses are also typically characterized by the absence ofequipment and facilities for long distance travel, <T3>e.g.</T3>, rest rooms, large luggage compartments, and facilities forstowing carry-on luggage. The useful life for urban buses is the same asthe useful life for the applicable primary intended service class for heavy-dutydiesel engines. 16.

(a)(1) Heavy-duty engines eligible for the NO<T2>X</T2> and particulate averaging, trading, and banking programs aredescribed in the applicable emission standards sections in this subpart.Participation in these programs is voluntary. (2)(i) Engine families with FELs exceeding the applicable standard shallobtain emission credits in a mass amount sufficient to address the shortfall.Credits may be obtained from averaging, trading, or banking, within therestrictions described in this section. (ii) Engine families with FELs below the applicable standard will haveemission credits available to average, trade, or bank (or a combinationthereof). Credits may not be used for averaging or trading to offset emissionsthat exceed an FEL. Credits may not be used to remedy an in-use nonconformitydetermined by a Selective Enforcement Audit or by in-use testing. (b) Participation in the NO<T2>X</T2> and/or particulate averaging, trading, and banking programsshall be done as follows. (1) During certification, the manufacturer shall: (i) Declare its intent to include specific engine families in the averaging,trading and/or banking programs. Separate declarations are required foreach program and for each pollutant (<T3>i.e.,</T3> NO<T2>X</T2> and particulate). (ii) Declare an FEL for each engine family participating in one or moreof these three programs. (A) The FEL must be to the same level of significant digits as the emissionstandard (one-tenth of a gram per brake horsepower for NO<T2>X</T2> emissions and one-hundredth of a gram per brake horsepower-hourfor particulate emissions). (B) In no case may the FEL exceed the upper limit prescribed in the sectionconcerning the applicable heavy-duty engine NO<T2>X</T2> and particulate emission standards. (iii) Calculate the projected emission credits (+/^) for each participatingfamily and for each pollutant (NO<T2>X</T2> and particulate), using the equation in paragraph (c) of thissection and the applicable factors for the specific engine family. (iv)(A) Determine and state the source of the needed credits for enginefamilies requiring credits for certification. (B) State where the projected credits will be applied for engine familiesgenerating credits.(C) Credits may be obtained from or applied to only engine families withinthe same averaging set as described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.Credits are available for averaging, trading, or banking as defined inandSection; 86.090-2, may be applied singly to a given engine family, orreserved as defined in andSection; 86.091-2. (2) Based on this information each manufacturer's certification applicationmust demonstrate: (i) That each engine family has net mass emissions of zero using the methodologyin paragraph (c) of this section with any credits obtained from averaging,trading or banking. (ii) The source of the credits to be used to comply with the emission standardif the FEL exceeds the standard, or where credits will be applied if theFEL is less than the standard. In cases where credits are being obtained,each engine family involved must state specifically the source (manufacturer/enginefamily) of the credits being used. In cases where credits are being generated/supplied,each engine family involved must state specifically the designated use(manufacturer/engine family) of the credits involved. All such reportsshall include all credits involved in averaging, trading or banking. (3) During the model year manufacturers must: (i) Monitor projected versus actual production to be certain that compliancewith the emission standards is achieved at the end of the model year. (ii) Provide the quarterly and end-of-model year reports required underandSection; 86.091-23. (4) Projected credits based on information supplied in the certificationapplication may be used to obtain a certificate of conformity. However,any such credits must be verified based on review of end-of-model yearreports, any audits it conducts, and any other verification steps deemedappropriate by the Administrator. (5) Compliance under averaging, banking, and trading will be determinedat the end of the model year. Engine families without an adequate amountof verified NO<T2>X</T2> and/or particulate emission credits will violate the conditionsof the certificate of conformity. The certificates of conformity may bevoided <T3>ab initio</T3> for each engine in those families, regardless of thesource cited for the credits.(6) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error occurredon a report previously submitted to EPA under this section, the manufacturer'scredits and credit calculations shall be recalculated. Erroneous positivecredits will be void. Erroneous negative credits may be verified by EPAfor retroactive use. The end-of-year credit balance will be recalculatedfor the applicable model year. (c)(1) For each participating engine family, NO<T2>x</T2> and particulate emission credits (positive or negative) areto be calculated according to the following equation and rounded, in accordancewith ASTM E29-67, to the nearest one-tenth of a Megagram (Mg). Consistentunits are to be used throughout the equation.<ITAG tagnum="26">Emission credits=(Std-FEL)andmultiply;(CF)andmultiply;(UL)andmultiply;(Production)andmultiply;(10^6)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Std=the current and applicable heavy-duty engine NO<T2>x</T2> or particulate emission standard in grams per brake horsepowerhour or grams per Megajoule. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">FEL=the NO<T2>x</T2> or particulate family emission limit for the engine family ingrams per brake horsepower-hour or grams per Megajoule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CF=a transient cycle conversion factor in BHP-hr/mi or MJ/mi, as givenin paragraph (c)(2) of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">UL=the useful life, or alternative life as described in paragraph(f) of andSection; 86.090-21, for the given engine family in miles.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Production=the number of engines produced for U.S. sales within thegiven engine family during the model year. Production projections are usedfor initial certification. Actual production is used for end-of-year verificationand compliance determination.</ITAG>(2) The transient cycle conversion factor is the total cycle brake horsepower-houror Megajoules, divided by the equivalent mileage of the applicable transientcycle. For Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.3miles. For diesel heavy-duty engines, the equivalent mileage is 6.5 miles.When more than one configuration is chosen by EPA to be tested in the certificationof an engine family (as described in andSection; 86.085-24), the conversionfactor used is to be based upon the production-weighted average of theconversion factors of all configurations tested. (d) <T3>Averaging sets for NO</T3><T2>x</T2> emission credits. The averaging and trading of NO<T2>x</T2> emission credits will only be allowed between heavy-duty enginefamilies in the same averaging set and in the same regional category. Enginesproduced for sale in California constitute a separate regional categorythan engines produced for sale in the other 49 states. The averaging setsfor the averaging and trading of NO<T2>x</T2> emission credits for heavy-duty engines are defined as follows:(1) For <T3>Otto-cycle </T3>heavy-duty engines. (i) Otto-cycle heavy-duty enginesconstitute an averaging set. Averaging and trading between gasoline-fueledand methanol-fueled, Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine families is allowed.(ii) Heavy heavy-duty engines constitute an averaging set. Otto-cycle heavyheavy-duty engine families may therefore average and trade credits withother Otto-cycle heavy-duty engine families <T3>or </T3>with diesel heavy heavy-duty engine families. However, anygiven Otto-cycle heavy heavy-duty engine family <T3>may not </T3>average and/or trade with <T3>both </T3>Otto-cycle non-heavy heavy-duty engine families <T3>and </T3>with diesel heavy heavy-duty engine families. (iii) Manufacturers of Otto-cycle heavy heavy-duty engines must indicateupon certification which averaging set (Otto-cycle or diesel heavy heavy-duty)these engine families will participate in. An Otto-cycle heavy heavy-dutyengine family may <T3>not </T3>average and/or trade credits within <T3>both </T3>averaging sets. (2) For <T3>diesel </T3>heavy-duty engines. (i) Each of the three primary intendedservice classes for heavy-duty diesel engines, as defined in andSection;86.090-2, constitute an averaging set. Averaging and trading between petroleum-fueledand methanol-fueled, diesel engine families within the same primary serviceclass is allowed. (ii) Heavy heavy-duty engines constitute an averaging set. Averaging andtrading NO<T2>x</T2> emission credits between any heavy heavy-duty engine family(Otto-cycle or diesel) is allowed except as provided for in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)of this section. (e) <T3>Averaging sets for particulate emission credits. </T3>The averagingand trading of particulate emission credits will only be allowed betweenheavy-duty engine families in the same averaging set and in the same regionalcategory. Engines produced for sale in California constitute a separateregional category than engines produced for sale in the other 49 states.The averaging sets for the averaging and trading of particulate emissioncredits for heavy-duty engines are defined as follows:(1) Engines intended for use in <T3>urban buses</T3> constitute a separate averaging set from all otherheavy-duty engines. Averaging and trading between petroleum-fueled andmethanol-fueled diesel bus engine families is allowed. (2) For heavy-duty engines, exclusive of urban bus engines, each of thethree primary intended service classes for heavy-duty diesel engines, asdefined in andSection; 86.090-2, constitute an averaging set. Averaging andtrading between petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel engine familieswithin the same primary service class is allowed. (3) Otto-cycle engines may not participate in particulate averaging, trading,or banking. (f) Banking of NO<T2>X</T2> and particulate emission credits. (1) Credit deposits. (i) Emissioncredits may be banked only from engine families produced during the threemodel years prior to the effective model year of a new HDE NO<T2>X</T2> or particulate emission standard. Credits may <T3>not</T3> be banked from engine families made during any other modelyear. Particulate emission credits may be banked only when a change inthe particulate emission standard occurs. NO<T2>X</T2> emission credits may be banked only when a change in the NO<T2>X</T2> emission standard occurs, or, NO<T2>X</T2> and particulate emission credits may be banked from engine familiesproduced in any model year. (ii) Manufacturers may bank credits only after the end of the model yearand after EPA has verified their end-of-year report. During the model yearand before submittal of the end-of-year report, credits originally designatedin the certification process for banking will be considered reserved andmay be redesignated for trading or averaging. (2) Credit withdrawals. (i) Banked/reserved credits shall be availablefor use three model years prior to, through two model years immediatelyafter the effective date of a new HDE NO<T2>X</T2> or particulate emission standard, as applicable. However, creditsnot used within the period specified above shall be forfeited, or, bankedcredits shall be available for use within five model years following themodel year in which they were generated. Credits not used within the periodspecified above shall be forfeited. (ii) Manufacturers withdrawing banked emission credits shall indicate soduring certification and in their credit reports, as described in andSection;86.091-23. (3) Use of banked emission credits. The use of banked credits shall bewithin the restrictions described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section,and only for the following purposes: (i) Banked credits may be used singly for a given engine family, in averaging,or in trading, or in any combination thereof, during the certificationperiod. Credits declared for banking from the previous model year but unreviewedby EPA may also be used. However, if EPA finds that the reported creditscan not be verified, they will be unavailable for use. (ii) Banked credits may not be used for NO<T2>X</T2> or particulate averaging and trading to offset emissions thatexceed an FEL. Banked credits may not be used to remedy an in-use nonconformitydetermined by a Selective Enforcement Audit or by in-use testing. (g) Referring to paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, credits generatedin a given model year for use in the subsequent (next) model year's tradingprogram may remain reserved. Use of this provision requires that the end-of-modelyear report for the year the credits are generated designate that creditsare intended for trading in the next model year and state the amount ofcredits to be traded. Any such credits must be used in trading during thenext model year and would be lost at the end of that model year if notused for trading. The only exception would be if the credit generation/useoccurred within model years when the banking program allowed deposit/withdrawals,respectively. In these situations the credit could be banked if not used,subject to the other provisions of the banking program. (h)(1) The following paragraphs assume NO<T2>X</T2> and particulate NCPs will be available for the 1991 and latermodel year HDEs. (2) Engine families using NO<T2>X</T2> and/or particulate NCPs but not involved in averaging: (i) May not <T3>generate</T3> either NO<T2>X</T2> or particulate credits for banking and trading. (ii) May <T3>not</T3> use either NO<T2>X</T2> or particulate credits from banking and trading. (3) If a manufacturer has any engine family upon which application of NCPs<T3>and</T3> credits is desired, that family must be separated into twodistinct families. One family, whose FEL equals the standard, must useNCPs only while the other, whose FEL does not equal the standard, mustuse credits only. (4) If a manufacturer has any engine family in a given averaging set whichis using NO<T2>X</T2> and/or particulate NCPs, none of that manufacturer's enginefamilies in that averaging set may generate credits for banking and trading.(5) If within a given averaging set, a manufacturer has NO<T2>X</T2> or particulate credits available from banking but it desiresto purchase NO<T2>X</T2> or particulate NCPs instead the credit value would be eliminated.(i) In the event of a negative credit balance in a trading situation, boththe buyer and the seller would be liable.20.
