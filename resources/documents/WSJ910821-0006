The plant, which will be the world's largest making suchproducts, represents a vote of confidence by the chemicalcompany in the new product line.</LP><TEXT>   Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, are widely used asrefrigerants. But growing scientific evidence has suggestedthe compounds damage the earth's protective ozone layer. Aninternational agreement calls for CFCs to be phased out bythe year 2000, and chemical companies have been developingalternative products to meet that deadline.   Du Pont introduced its family of CFC substitutes, with thetrade name Suva, earlier this year; the new products haveone-fiftieth or less of the ozone-depleting potential ofFreon, the CFC-based coolant Du Pont makes for a range ofcooling products.   Du Pont said the plant, which will make the alternativerefrigerants HCFC-124 and HFC-134a, will open in 1993 inCorpus Christi at the site of a smaller Suva plant. Thecompany also has a Suva plant currently under construction inJapan, and a fourth is planned to open in the Netherlands in1994.   Earlier this summer, a research consortium of Du Pont andother chemical makers reported potentially troubling researchresults, which showed that lab animals exposed to a CFCreplacement known as HCFC-123 developed nonmalignant tumors.The Texas plant, however, won't be making that line, which isaimed at a specialized market for large &quot;chiller&quot; systems.   Du Pont said its CFC-substitute development expenditureswill total $1 billion by the end of the decade.</TEXT></DOC>
