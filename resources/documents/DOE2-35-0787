Wide-range performance will be emphasized to arm the dailyworker with instruments that routinely log background rates and, at thesame time, are prepared to measure accident rates. Separate and simultaneousaccumulation of data from several sensors to ensure complete coverageof the radiation types will be common. Mathematical manipulation of datawill provide for summary data logging and, in some cases, solutions tointegral equations to provide corrections to experimental data. Instrumentswill become more reliable by way of self-checking and correction. Miniaturizationand large-scale integration of measuring instruments will provide someinstrumentation for the people at large. To be effective, the instrumentswill necessarily cover a wide range and be very reliable. The net resultof these several trends will provide for a widespread understanding ofradiation protection and an implementation of as low as reasonably achievableamong large segments of the population.</TEXT></DOC>
