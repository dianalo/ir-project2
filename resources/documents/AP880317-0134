(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A widow who learned that her husband of27 years had been a bigamist has been asked to return $610 inSocial Security benefits.   Mazella Bouknight Lever, 80, said she learned after herestranged husband Noisey died July 29 that the woman who was livingwith him was his first wife, Carrie. She filed suit in Februaryseeking to evict the first Mrs. Lever.   The government has written Mrs. Lever demanding repayment of$610 in Social Security widow's benefits. ``Obviously, this is notsomething that she did intentionally. She thought that, in fact,she was the only Mrs. Lever,'' said her attorney, Stephen G. Smith.   ``The point is, she received benefits as a basis of beingmarried to this man,'' said Berion Mouton, Social Securityassistant district manager. She must show she is unable to repaythe money if she wants to avoid it, he said.   Mrs. Lever said she hadn't seen her husband since she moved outin November 1982. They were married in 1960.   Since his death, Mrs. Lever said, she has thought much aboutNoisey's motive for not divorcing Carrie. ``I guess he was justusing me,'' she said. ``I could always keep a good job.''</TEXT></DOC>
