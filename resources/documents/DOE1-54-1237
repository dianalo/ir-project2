The effective auxiliary mass of the liquid is solarge as to become comparable to or even greater than the proper massof the structure with the result of leading to response curves havingvery large suppression bandwidth. When the damper is incorporated ina structure with a gapped space, it provides the structure with nonlinearproperty with regard to natural frequency and effectively prevents theoccurrence of &quot;selective resonance&quot; to the random excitation like earthquake.In this paper, the basic principles of the accelerated liquid mass damperis described, and the theoretical model presented. Also, the responsesof the dampered test frame to both harmonic and random excitation arediscussed.</TEXT></DOC>
