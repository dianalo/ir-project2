The soldiers were released in a ceremony at an unfinishedelementary school in a remote mountain village near the town ofSipalay, about 400 miles south of Manila.   The ceremony was attended by about 200 villagers, as well ashuman rights lawyers, Roman Catholic clergy and communist NewPoeple's Army guerrillas armed with M-16 rifles, grenade launchersand other weapons, witnesses said.   No government military representatives were present.   ``We were scared this morning because we thought we will beexecuted in public,'' a jubilant Pfc. Ernesto Ayson told reporters.   Pfc. Roger Bendir, the second freed soldier, said he will quitthe military and become a farmer. Godofredo Okit, the third man,said he plans to return to his military unit.   One of the human rights lawyers, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said it was the first time rebels had freed capturedsoldiers since President Corazon Aquino rose to power in 1986.   Rebel spokesman Armando Pueblo said that during the ``trial,''the rebels took into consideration the fact that the soldierssurrendered immediately when guerrillas raided a militarydetachment in a nearby town last May. Nine soldiers and threerebels were killed in that incident.   Bishop Antonio Fortich of Bacolod, a port city about 300 milessoutheast of Manila, said he hopes the release will help reducetension on this strife-torn island of Negros. The bishop negotiatedwith rebels in behalf of the three soldiers.   In Manila today, Mrs. Aquino said she has directed militarycommanders to remove communist rebel elements from the army.   ``I have directed the various commands in our collective task ofremoving the elements of insurgency from our midst to unleash theweapons of war,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a speech on the 90thanniversary of the Philippine Navy. ``Force must be met by force.''   However, she said the military must temper its war on communistrebels with kindness, especially to insurgents who wish tosurrender.   She added that the military must be ready to receive ``withtemperance and compassion (rebels) who wish to mend their ways andreturn to the fold of the law.''   The outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines and its25,000-strong armed wing, the New People's Army, have been waging a19-year-old guerrilla war to establish a Marxist state.</TEXT></DOC>
