The Ad-Diyar newspaper also said there was a ``certainflexibility'' regarding the release of British hostages, while thefate of the other missing foreigners was linked to the developmentsin the Persian Gulf war.   But the Ad-Diyar report also said Iran still was insisting onthe release of 17 pro-Iranian activists held in Kuwait for bombingthe U.S. and French embassies there Dec. 3, 1983.   Ad-Diyar, which is based in Christian east Beirut, startedpublishing just four months ago. Its report was attributed to anunidentified Syrian security source, and it could not be confirmed.   Syrian and Lebanese security officials have long contended thatmost of the 18 Western hostages in Lebanon were held in the mainbarracks of Hezbollah, or Party of God, in Hay Madi distrtict insouth Beirut's slums.   ``The foreign hostages in Lebanon are divided into three groupsand held in three different locations,'' Ad-Diyar said. It said thethree groups were in the Hezbollah barracks, the Iranian Embassyand in the Sheik Abdullah barracks in Baalbek, a town in Lebanon'seast Bekaa Valley.   It said Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite was among the groupheld in Baalbek. Waite disappeared Jan. 20, 1987 after leaving hiswest Beirut hotel on a mission to negotiate the hostages' release.   No other names or nationalities of hostages were mentioned inthe report.   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is believed to an umbrella groupfor various pro-Iranian extremist factions holding hostages.   The three locations listed are policed by Syrian forces. Syriahas 40,000 troops in eastern and northern Lebanon as well as inwest Beirut and its southern suburbs.   Ad-Diyar said the hostages ``are controlled by a Hezbollah wingwhich answers directly to Tehran.''   Iran's deputy foreign minister, Hossein Sheikholeslam, was inBeirut when Syria sent an estimated 2,500 troops into the southernslums to quell three weeks of bloody fighting between Hezbollah andthe rival Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal militia in May.   Ad-Diyar said Sheikholeslam managed to smuggle some of thehostages from Hay Madi to Baalbek and to the Iranian Embassy inanother part of south Beirut before the Syrians moved in. It didnot elaborate on Sheikholeslam's alleged role.   ``There is a certain flexibility regarding the release of theBritish hostages after relations improved between Iran andBritain,'' Ad-Diyar said.   ``But the fate of the other hostages will remain closely linkedto the developments in the U.N. Security Council concerning theIran-Iraq war,'' the daily added.   Britain said early this month it was reviewing its strainedrelations with Iran following the latter's acceptance of SecurityCouncil Resolution 598, which calls for a cease-fire in the8-year-old Persian Gulf war.   Nine Americans are among the 18 Westerners missing in Lebanon.The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondentfor The Associated Press. He was kidnapped on March 16, 1985 inMoslem west Beirut.</TEXT></DOC>
