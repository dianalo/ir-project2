The acquisition paid off -- at first.   Then came the recession, and demand for powerboatsslumped. But this time, instead of diversifying into yetanother product, Mr. Hood looked for a new customer base.Rather than battening down the hatches in Black Watch'sshrinking pleasure-craft market, he steered it toward a newmarket, patrol boats. It worked: Sales, while below theirpeak, are rising.</LP><TEXT>   In these uncertain economic times, entrepreneurs arefinding they have to do more than just add to their productlines and redouble their selling efforts. As buying patternschange, they are being forced to rethink the nature of theirbusinesses and adapt them to new markets. It can be aperilous exercise. But for those able to adjust, such movescan pay dividends.   In the 1980s, national trends were working against Mr.Hood. New boaters were buying easier-to-master powerboats,and existing sailboat owners held onto their aging butdurable fiberglass models. Many builders were failing. Mr.Hood felt vulnerable, so he bought Black Watch.   As it turned out, his fears were unfounded. Sales of hissailboats held steady. The reason was probably reputation:Mr. Hood, who skippered America's Cup winner Courageous in1974, is a noted sailor. In sailmaking, his Hood Sails setthe standard for competitive sailors. He pioneered theautomatic furler for jibs and mainsails. And his LittleHarbor Custom Yachts are revered by wealthy customers.   But whether he needed it or not, Black Watch seemed to bea good buy. Its business boomed in the late 1980s. Then in1990 the bottom fell out of the powerboat market. Not onlydid the recession hit; the government slapped a 10% luxurytax on boats costing more than $100,000. Black Watch salescollapsed. This year, the company has sold only 20recreational boats, less than one-third the 1989 record totalof 70. In the summer, the line slashed employment to ninefrom its peak of 60.   But government contracts, which kept the yard alive lastyear, promise growth now. Black Watch has just won a $10million three-year contract from the U.S. Navy to design andbuild high-speed drone boats to be used for target practice.It also got a $3 million contract from the Navy for 10smaller boats that will serve as launches to carry crews andsupplies to and from anchored vessels. Government orders nowrepresent the bulk of Hood Enterprises' powerboat business.   Making the switch to the public sector involved risks,however. Mr. Hood's company entered the government marketlast year by selling eight patrol boats to Taiwan's customsservice for $3.5 million. Taiwan needed craft that could belaunched safely in stormy seas. Mr. Hood decided to stretchan existing mold for fiberglass boats for building a vesselthat would right itself.   The problem was, computer models didn't demonstrateconclusively that the design would work. So Mr. Hood reliedon his instincts and took a chance. &quot;We could have easilyblown $500,000 if we had to do a lot of rebuilding,&quot; he says.   The Taiwan order was a gamble in other ways, too. Unlikeyacht buyers, who make progress payments while a boat isunder construction, Taiwan specified it would pay cash ondelivery -- and then only if the boats performed to contractspecifications.   Moreover, Hood had to race against time because Taiwandidn't complete its order until April 1990, four months laterthan expected. &quot;We only had eight months to produce the firstfour boats,&quot; Mr. Hood recalls. And that included designingand building new molds for the fiberglass deck and pilothouse. To enable the boats to achieve the high speedsrequired by Taiwan, Mr. Hood fitted them with engines unlikethose he used in recreational boats.   He won his bet. Eight months later, when the first of thenew boats was put in the water, workmen pulled it upside downwith cables and watched it pop upright. Mr. Hood says theunusual boats can right themselves after being flipped overin stormy seas and keep all motors and electronic gearfunctioning.   If government contracts are where the money is, they alsotake some of the fun out of boat building. Not only canbureaucrats set stiff terms, they can be more intrusive thanprivate clients. Before the Navy contracts were signed, Mr.Hood says, &quot;Government people were constantly in checking usout financially. That's what you have to put up with.&quot;   But it seems it was a small price to pay for prosperity.Hood Enterprises, with annual revenue of about $25 millionand a work force of 250, is profitable. Once the Taiwan boatswere delivered, Mr. Hood says, &quot;We solicited more orders. Wehired a guy in Washington to keep in touch with theembassies.&quot; He also reassigned Rounseville &quot;Skip&quot; Schaum, a59-year-old aerospace consultant who had been hired toestablish overseas boatyards, to manage Black Watch and buildup government business.   Neil Churchill, director of the center for entrepreneurialstudies at Babson College and a Hood Enterprises director,says Hood succeeded because it leveraged its success with theTaiwan contract to move into more government markets ratherthan gear up for the new business all at once.   &quot;A lot of companies try to rethink their businesses, butonly a few make it,&quot; Mr. Churchill says. &quot;Small businessesdon't have a lot of resources. They can't make deep mistakes.Picking your target is really critical. You climb up anopportunity ladder. You get credibility and develop skills.Then you can go after new opportunities.&quot;   Mr. Schaum states the idea more succinctly: &quot;Things mustchange to remain the same,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
