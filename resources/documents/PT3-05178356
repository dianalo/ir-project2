The assembly is made up of a container (1)      and a shaft (5), the container being filled with water, sand or gravel and      including a handle (2) and a hole (4) through which the shaft is housed;      and the shaft comprising elements nesting into each other which can be      placed one on top of the other. The support assembly can be made of      plastic or of a light alloy. </PAR></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This Invention concerns a multipurpose support assembly for playground      equipment; miscellaneous shelter constructions (rain huts, wind-breaks,      sun screens etc.); safety boundaries (particularly for monitoring      recreation areas) (notably on beaches); construction of exhibition-stand      partitions; safety barriers around civil engineering sites; erection of      decorative panels or advertising boardings, or notice boards of any kind. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Within the stated applications (except in cases of hard surfaces) it is      common practice to employ shafts or uprights fixed into the ground; the      high weight and large dimensions of such uprights do not make for easy      transport; a maximum of fixed rings also are required for attaching the      desired equipment (rope, elastic cord etc.), and construction of the      upright itself requires further hardware (nuts and bolts). </PAR><PAR>  The subject of the Invention is to provide a multipurpose support assembly      obviating the above disadvantages, suitable for all types of ground, of      low weight, easily transportable, adjustable, with no bolting systems, to      allow rapid installation through simple stacking of the various structural      elements, and rapid attachment of accessories; in sum, a system producible      in various dimensions tailored for the end-user (children or adults) and      of a weight tailored for the type of accessories to be supported. This      device is equally designed as an instructional tool for children of even      the earliest ages, in team sports as volley ball or individual sports such      as high-jumping or shooting. The same device can also be employed for      educational games, as, for example, by attaching signs to the said      supports when teaching the Highway Code. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This Invention covers a series of superimposable parts forming a support      allowing attachment of games accessories (nets, skipping ropes, elastic      cord for high-jumping, pennons or flags), as well as miscellaneous panels      and shelter elements. </PAR><PAR>  General low weight, and the compactness of the multipurpose support and its      accessories (stowed in a simple hand-carried bag) make for easy transport,      even by small children. </PAR><PAR>  The support consists of modules of various shapes placed on or nesting one      in the other. The basic module is formed by a container which can be      filled with water, sand or gravel to give the necessary weight for      supporting the various games equipment, shelter elements or panels. Where      required, several basic elements can be stacked to give the necessary      weight to counterbalance the size and weight of the various accessories. </PAR><PAR>  Each module used in the support is produced as a single injection- or      blow-molded plastic part. Other lightweight high-strength materials can be      used such as aluminum, giving the required features of rigidity, strength      and above all, lightness to ensure implementation by children. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a view of a complete support assembly according to the invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 depicts an accessory designed for the &quot;elastic skipping&quot; game. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 depicts an accessory designed for high jumping. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 depicts three accessories for installation at the top of the shaft      (13). </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 illustrates a textile or plastic-film panel assembly. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  A complete support assembly is illustrated in FIG. 1: </PAR><PAR>  Basic module (1) is a container whose upper part contains filler-opening      (3). The container is penetrated vertically by sleeve (4) which receives      module (5), onto which the container is seated. Housing (6) in the      container bottom receives shoulder (7) mounted on the end of module (5).      The container bottom also has housing (8) dimensioned to receive      filler-opening (3), hence allowing stacking of several containers (9). </PAR><PAR>  One side contains handle (2) formed by a housing above and below a central      part left integral with the container side. </PAR><PAR>  Module (5) forms the first element of the shaft (or &quot;prop&quot;) and is fitted      with boss (7) which houses in container (1). The other end contains bore      (10) which has sufficient depth to receive rod (11), which is strong      enough to form a sound interface with another module (12). </PAR><PAR>  Module (12) is another part of the prop, penetrated by bore (13) which has      sufficient depth to receive rod (11), which is strong enough to form a      sound interface with other modules (13). Depending on the application      (games etc.), the length of this module can be varied. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 represents an accessory designed for the &quot;elastic skipping&quot; game and      comprising three parts: sliding part (14) (two off), crossbar (15) (two      off), and elastic cord (16). Slide (14) is split down one face to form a      two-part &quot;clip&quot; allowing upward and downward movement (height adjustment)      along the prop. The side opposide the split side has a shoulder containing      an opening into which another part (crossbar stem) is fitted, to receive      stub (17) on the crossbar. </PAR><PAR>  Crossbar (15) is designed to space the two parts of elastic (16); the      elastic fits in a groove along one side of the crossbar. Hence this      accessory enables a lone child to play the elastic game, whereas three      children are normally involved (two using their legs to hold the elastic      apart). </PAR><PAR>  Slide (14) also can be used for height-marking when used with graduated      shafts. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 represents an accessory designed for high-jumping and consisting of      a flat scale (18) with sleeve (19) fixed along one side. The part fits      over support mast (12). This part is perforated (20) at one-centimeter      centers along each long side, hence forming the graduations and a position      mark for the elastic, which is attached to the scale at the selected hole.      A number (21) is scribed alongside each hole. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 illustrates three accessories for installation at the top of shaft      (13): </PAR><PA1>  1st accessory (22) is a rod topped by a target; </PA1><PA1>  2nd accessory (23) is a rigid bar topped by a ring for attaching a chain or      skipping rope via a swivel; </PA1><PA1>  3rd accessory (24) is a rod topped by a notice or sign board. </PA1><PAR>  FIG. 5 illustrates a textile or plastic-film panel (25) (two thickness of      heat-welded material forming pockets (26) between the two sides); the      pockets receive lathes (27) providing rigidity while allowing the assembly      to be folded fan-wise. Two side pockets or tunnels (28) are slid over the      shafts, to extend the panel. </PAR><PAR>  The device covered by the Invention has applications in the field of      leisure, safety, decoration, communication and teaching. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
