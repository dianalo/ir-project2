Thomas Schaefer helps people cope withstress. Bruce Laingen keeps a yellow ribbon on his flag to rememberother U.S. hostages.   Kevin Hermening treasures walks in the free, fresh air of theforest with the appreciation of one who was held for 444 days by anIranian mob 10 years ago.   ``Whether we like it or not, we'll always be ex-hostages. Itdrives me in everything I do,'' said Hermening, 30, an ex-Marineand the youngest hostage.   ``I feel I've been given a second chance,'' said Hermening, wholives in suburban Milwaukee. ``You can either go into a shell andhave it eat at your insides, or you can grow. You have to get onwith life.''   It was Sunday morning, Nov. 4, 1979, when an Iranian mob brokeinternational law and shamed a superpower by seizing the U.S.Embassy. Fifty-two Americans were held until Jan. 20, 1981, the dayRonald Reagan took over Jimmy Carter's foiled presidency.   The militants demanded the return of their hated shah, who hadentered a U.S. hospital for cancer treatment 13 days before thetakeover. When that failed, they dangled their captors as pawns tofuel their revolution. In the process, Iran became an outcast inthe world community.   The hostages became metaphors of American humiliation and painbut also were a unifying force. The joy of their release rekindledpatriotism and helped a nation heal the leftover wounds of Vietnam.   Their ordeal is seared into the American psyche along withimages of a glowering ayatollah, eight soldiers who died in adesert in hopes of freeing them, billboards saying ``MerciBeaucoup'' to Canadians who helped six Americans escape and yellowribbons that fluttered the message the entire country was hostage.   ``When we returned, that burden of having been held hostagepolitically was lifted from the country's shoulders,'' saidLaingen, the embassy's charge d'affaires who now directs theNational Commission on Public Service, a private agency working toattract quality people to the government.   ``We were 52 Americans in distress. The whole country ralliedaround. We saw a national catharsis,'' he said.   Laingen, 68, sets out his American flag beribboned in yellow toremember the eight American hostages held by Iranian-backedradicals in Lebanon, one of whom has been held for over four years.   ``I think most of us have put the hurt, the travail of ourexperience behind us,'' Laingen said. ``The most telling reminderis that terrorism has not gone away, hostage-taking has not goneaway.''   The hostages endured mock executions, beatings, solitaryconfinement and wormy food over 14 months.   Holland, a retired Army colonel, says some scars still existfrom being imprisoned alone in a bug-infested dungeon.   ``Heaven help a roach if I see one. I will get a shotgun to killa fly. I hate bugs,'' said Holland, 62, who was handcuffed,blindfolded and smacked with a rifle butt during captivity.   He got some measure of revenge by showing his backside to TVcameras set up by his captors to track hostages when they went tothe bathroom.   Holland, now living in the Washington, D.C., area, was toldthree years ago he has prostate cancer.   ``I can sit around and worry myself to death, or I can takeadvantage of however much time I have left on earth. I don't intendto be miserable because of what happened to me,'' Holland said.   Explaining why he's not bitter toward his captors, he said, ``Ifnothing else, I want to show I'm tougher than they are.''   The hostage crisis boiled down to a quarrel between twocountries that still share a deep mutual distrust. It was resolvedwhen the United States pledged not to interfere in Iran's internalaffairs and the two countries established a framework for settlingbillions of dollars in claims against each other.   The United States still holds Iranian assets valued at billionsof dollars. Diplomatic relations are severed.   The freed Americans were treated like prisoners of a politicalwar fought with nerves rather than bullets.   ``None of us thinks of ourselves as heroes. We think ofourselves as people who survived,'' said Barry Rosen, a formerpress attache who is now assistant to the president at BrooklynCollege.   Thomas Schaefer, a retired Air Force colonel, rationalized hiscaptivity as a learning experience. He opened an agency devoted tohelping people handle stress and adversity.   ``I don't look at it as losing 444 days of my life. I gainedmany things, such as finding out strengths I never knew I had untilI was presented with this challenge,'' said Schaefer, 60, nowliving in Sun City West, Ariz.   Some of the 52 hostages are still in the diplomatic service andsome have switched careers or retired. One, William Keough, died in1985.   Robert Blucher, an oil specialist who arrived in Iran one weekbefore the takeover, doesn't register to vote so he won't beconfined in a room if he's called to jury duty.   ``I'm not prepared to do jury duty. I don't like to be in thecontrol of others,'' said Blucher, 63, of San Antonio.   Joseph Subic, a former Army sergeant, works in enforcement forthe state Agriculture Department in southern Florida. He was theonly serviceman not decorated upon his release. Other hostages sayhe cooperated with his captors by giving background information oncomrades, but he denies helping the enemy.   ``I did the best I could. I have nothing to look back on and sayI'm sorry for. I sleep well at night. I have nothing to hide,''said Subic, 33.   ``Iran is over with.''</TEXT></DOC>
