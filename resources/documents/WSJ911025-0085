Now the entire country is going&quot;the direction of the wheels coming off,&quot; one top advisersays.</LP><TEXT>   Top Western finance officials will be in Moscow thisweekend to try to head off a Soviet liquidity crisis. Theyhope to persuade the various factions to stand behindexisting Soviet debt. Yeltsin also may offer a new economicplan soon.   &quot;Yeltsin's the only one who can hold this place together,&quot;argues Peter Rodman, an analyst at the Johns Hopkins ForeignPolicy Institute. &quot;He has to exert more influence than hehas.&quot;                                                                                                          CRUCIAL DETAILS remain unresolved for next week's Mideastpeace conference.   One touchy question is where to hold the directArab-Israeli talks that are supposed to follow the meetingsthat open next week in Madrid. Arabs want the follow-up talksin Madrid, but the Israelis insist on a Mideast site. TheU.S. hasn't decided whether to name a Mideast envoy to followup the talks, but officials say he wouldn't be a high-powerednegotiator.   A high U.S. official expects the conference to be littlemore than &quot;three days of speeches&quot; with each side staking outits maximum position. But the hope is that gathering Arabsand Israelis in the same room for the first time will breakdown mistrust. The White House believes it has leverage overIsrael, which will be seeking $10 billion in U.S. loanguarantees in January.                                                                                                          DEMOCRATS GROPE for ways to take advantage of Bush on theweak economy.   Wilder stresses middle-class tax breaks, but getspre-empted by the Washington establishment he loves to bashas congressional Democrats seize the tax-cutting spotlight.Clinton also makes the middle class his mantra, but so farhas stressed values, not economic ideas. Kerrey hasn't hadmuch to say on the issue.   Harkin wants to spend freed-up defense money on roads,schools and health care before cutting taxes. Cuomo, teasingDemocrats by hinting he'll run, backs a version of thecapital-gains cut sought by Bush and unspecified middle-classtax relief. Tsongas, the self-described &quot;pro-business&quot;Democrat, favors a capital-gains cut and also joins singerDon Henley to oppose development near Thoreau's Walden Pond.   Most Democratic presidential candidates &quot;don't seem to beinterested in lowering taxes the way the congressionalDemocrats are,&quot; says Heritage Foundation President EdwinFeulner.                                                                                                          NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS downplay Oliver North's newbook. Former Reagan aide Robert McFarlane dismisses North'sclaim that a few more days of bargaining in Tehran in 1986might have freed all U.S. hostages as &quot;a stupid idea&quot; andthinks Iran may have duped North into making the trip. A topBush official says North's assertions are aimed at sellingbooks.                                                                                                          FALLOUT FEARS: U.S. officials worry that the independentUkraine and Khazakhstan republics could still become nuclearpowers even if they turn over their Soviet nuclear weapons tothe central control of Russia. The two republics still havehundreds of experts who worked on the Soviet nuclear weaponsprogram.                                                                                                          NO GLASNOST HERE: The Treasury Department rejects a pressrequest to open the quarterly meetings of its BorrowingAdvisory Committee, a panel of bond dealers and investorsthat advises on government borrowing policy. The panel meetsnext week for the first time since the Salomon scandal broke.                                                                                                          PHANTOM FORCE? A Police Corps provision in the crime billto provide scholarships for college students who agree toserve four years in a police force wins bipartisan supportand rhetoric. But even some backers concede that the program-- approved at $800 million over five years by the House --may have trouble being funded.                                                                                                          BUSH'S STRING of successful vetoes faces a test onabortion counseling.   The president is likely to extend his perfect record of 23vetoes on a number of pending bills. Legislation on extendedjobless benefits, student loans, family leave and even thehighway bill all are likely to be vetoed. Lawmakers probablycan't override any of the vetoes.   But a move by Congress to loosen rules limitinginformation that federally funded health clinics can provideon abortion could be Bush's first defeat. Unlike other vetofights, Democrats have support from many Republicans. &quot;We'removing toward a veto override vote, and we're confident thatwe can override,&quot; says an aide to GOP Sen. Chafee of RhodeIsland.   Interest groups join veto fights: Citizen Action willattack Bush on jobless benefits in TV ads Tuesday in Houston,Charleston, W.Va., and Washington.
