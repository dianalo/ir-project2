Spokeswoman Carol McBurney of Zimmerman Public Relations said theColumbus Commission on Ethics and Values voted Wednesday to extendit until mid-January to allow several projects to be completed. Oneproject is a change in school curriculum to include lessons inhonesty.   ``We will have some kind of a wrap-up event in January. We had toset an ending date _ some people on the commission never want it toend,'' she said.   The extension also gives the panel time to determine how _ and if_ it will be able to gauge the campaign's effectiveness.   Magruder said an attempt will be made this fall in conjunctionwith Ohio State University to determine public opinion on the isse.   ``Honesty isn't something you can measure,'' he said. ``But youcan measure whether the message has been heard. Whether it sank inis another question altogether.''   But if crime statistics are any indication, the commission hasmore work to do. Overall, the rate of felony crimes as of June wasup from last year, said Howard Wilson, city police crime preventioncoordinator.   ``For the city of Columbus, the uniform crime index is up 8.2percent in a comparison of January to June 1988 to the same periodin 1989,'' he said.   Cases of murder and manslaughter are up 20.5 percent from lastyear, vehicle thefts rose 28 percent and aggravated assaults were up11.6 percent.   However, the number of cases of forcible rape dropped by 24.9percent, he said.   Told about the increase in the crime rate, Ms. McBurney joked,``Well, I guess we'd better not use those figures, then.''   Magruder, deputy director of communications in the administrationof Richard Nixon and deputy director of Nixon's Committee toRe-elect the President in 1972, went to prison after he admitteddestroying records and committing perjury in the Watergate scandal.   He was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1981 and now serves atFirst Community Church in suburban Marble Cliff.   Magruder said he is pleased with the dozens of tales he hascollected demonstrating individual acts of honesty.   ``We had a woman return five bags of lottery tickets she found,and someone returned $100 from an automatic teller machine at theColumbus airport that wasn't his,'' he said. ``And a woman from FortWayne, Ind., who stayed in a local hotel to attend a wedding leftbehind an envelope with cash in it. She forgot about it until shegot home and was pleased and delighted to find out from the hotelclerk that somebody turned it in.''   The privately funded campaign has spread its word via billboards,public service announcements on radio and television, and one publicforum. It also has sent information to schools to encourage teachersto include honesty in lesson plans.   The commission's next effort, which will begin sometime early inthe new year, will focus on respect and prejudice. </TEXT></DOC>
