The unusual decision handed down Wednesday by U.S. District JudgeJoseph Tauro stems from the newspaper's efforts to obtain a taperecording of the 90-minute drug trial in 1987 of then-police OfficerSalvador Aponte in West Roxbury District Court.   The ruling allows the newspaper's lawyers to subpoena and,through depositions, question the trial participants under oath.   A Globe reporter was told that Aponte had been found guilty, butthen acquitted after a defense lawyer told the judge Aponte would befired if convicted.   When the Globe requested the tape recording of the trial to checkout the tip, court clerks wouldn't provide it because a statestatute required courts to seal all verdicts of innocent.   The newspaper filed suit in federal court challenging thatstatute. Last year, Tauro ruled the law unconstitutional.   The attorney general's office appealed Tauro's ruling but said itwould provide the Globe with the tape of Aponte's trial if theappeal were rejected.   The Globe won on the appeal this year, then found that therecording of the trial was erased last November.   Court clerks routinely reused audio tapes 13 months after trial,James Mannering, assistant clerk for West Roxbury court, saidThursday.   The tape of the Aponte trial ``was reused in its normal course ofevents,'' he said.   Clerks have since been ordered to keep tapes for 2{ years after atrial ends.   E. Susan Garsh, a Globe attorney, said Tauro's ruling tore-create the trial is a remedy to the loss of the newspaper's FirstAmendment right to the trial record.   While judges sometimes order evidence and even testimonyre-created for participants in a trial, Wantland Sandel Jr. of theAmerican Bar Association said Tauro seemed to be stretching the ideain a novel way by using it to serve the public's right to know.   ``I've never heard of this particular application of the conceptbefore,'' said Sandel from his Chicago office, where he is directorof the ABA's judicial services. ``It's really the public's rightthat's being protected.''   ``It's an interesting application of the unwritten theory thatthe news media are quasi-government, in that they have not only theright but almost the duty to represent the public in news gatheringand dissemination,'' Sandel added.   Professor Donald Lively, who teaches constitutional andcommunications law at the University of Toledo in Ohio, also calledthe ruling rare if not unique. ``I sure have never heard of anythinglike that,'' he said.   ``That's really trying to bend over backward to promote thespirit of the First Amendment,'' he said.   But Lively said he was skeptical that it would work.   ``I don't see how he can order those people to participate,'' hesaid.   Mary Coughlin, a clerk for Tauro, said that since the depositionswere ordered by the court, participants defying the order would riska charge of contempt. However, trial participants can file a motionto quash the subpoena order, Ms. Coughlin said.   Anthony Cardinale, who was Aponte's attorney during the trial,was in court Thursday and could not be reached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
