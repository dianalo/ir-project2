SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hordes of high school and college graduates aremaking the rounds of job interviews, and those face-to-face meetingscan be crucial to landing employment.   A good-looking resume and thorough job application are a goodstart, but those efforts lead to the interview, the make-or-breakmoment in getting the job.   Think of the man standing on a subway platform in New Yorkholding a violin case. He asks a conductor ``How do you get toCarnegie Hall?''   The conductor answers: ``Practice, practice, practice.''   That's the case in job interviews, too.   Consider beforehand what may be asked, practice questions andanswers with a friend, and don't get discouraged if it takes severaltries to land a job. Each interview is good practice for the nextone.   Time is important in business, so the first thing to remember isto be on time for the interview. Start out early and arrive a littleearly if possible. And don't bring anyone along for moral support.   Appearance is also important, say experts at the LaborDepartment. The job interview is not a good time to expressindividuality or eccentricity in dress or grooming.   The clothing worn to an interview depends to some extent on thejob being applied for, but in all cases should be clean, neat andconservative.   Men, Labor Department officials say, should wear suits or shirtsand slacks. Dresses are best for women.   Think in advance about how to answer some of the most likelyquestions, such as why you want to work for that particular company,what your interests and goals are and how you can help the company.This requires learning something about the company beforehand,either from library reading or by talking to people who work there.   In answering questions, pause to compose an answer that isconcise and to the point. This requires careful listening to makesure you understand the questions. And be sure to let theinterviewer finish the question. Don't interrupt.   If you don't understand a question, ask the interviewer what heor she means. Then answer honestly.   Sometimes people will ask why you left a former job. Tell thetruth, but do not say negative things about former employers. Suchremarks may be interpreted as unwillingness on your part tocooperate.   Two of the hardest questions to deal with are the open-endedones, such as ``tell me about yourself'' and ``what can I do foryou?''   The idea is to get you talking, and the best answer is to narrowdown the focus to the reasons why you are a good candidate for thejob in question.   Don't just ramble on about yourself, describing long-term goalsor saying such things as ``I'd like to utilize my education'' or ``Ilike to work with people.''   Better is something more specific, such as ``I've always had aninterest in wholesale sales in the electronic industry and I havestudied marketing, which should help me in this job.''   There are some questions employers are not supposed to ask unlessthey pertain to the job, such as marital status, family planning andchild-care arrangements. Some will ask anyway, and it's probablybest to go ahead and answer.   The focus in a first interview should be on the company and whatyou can do for it, not on pay and fringe benefits. Information onthose things should be available from the personnel department. Atany rate, reserve the discussion of pay until a job offer is made.   At the end of the interview, ask what the next step will be _whether you should contact the company again or provide moreinformation, if the company will call you, and when a final decisionis likely to be made.   Try to end on a positive note, repeating your interest in the job.   After the interview, send a note to the interviewer, thanking himor her for the time and providing any added information that mayhave been requested.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wednesday AMs, June 6</NOTE></DOC>
