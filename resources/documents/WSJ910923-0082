But the king, who will meet President GeorgeBush and other American officials during a state visit to theU.S. this week, thinks the current U.S.-led peace effort isthe most promising yet.   That's because, he said during a rare interview at hisseafront summer palace in Skhirat, near Rabat, &quot;never beforehas the U.S. gone so far so frankly and so courageouslytoward solving the problems of the Middle East.&quot; The king,perhaps the Arab leader most respected in Israel, has been apivotal figure in past initiatives, including bringing Israeland Egypt together in what grew into the Camp David accords.The current peace process, he said, is &quot;irreversible&quot; becauseit is occurring in a world much changed by the Persian GulfWar.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We were a millimeter from the whole thing exploding,&quot; theking said, puffing on a cigarette in a wood-paneled receivingroom just off the summer palace's swimming pool. &quot;If a Scudwith a chemical warhead had fallen on Israel, we might haveseen Arabs fighting Americans, Europeans and Israelis. Wepassed too close to catastrophe.&quot; More important, he added,the war &quot;proved that the economic interests of everybody areso intertwined that it's time to put a stop to thissituation. Arab countries can't develop their economicpotential if they're only buying arms. Israel has 400%inflation. Nobody's making any money, everybody's going tobecome poor.&quot;   (Actually, Israel's inflation rate was that high in themid-1980s, but the country has since brought price increasesunder control. In July, consumer prices rose just 3%, andthat was the largest monthly increase in two and a halfyears.)   During his visit to Washington and New York, King Hassanwill also be focusing on how Morocco hopes to become rich, orat least richer. He will hold talks with the InternationalMonetary Fund that could lead to the signing of a standbyagreement that would enable Morocco to wrap up reschedulingtalks on its huge foreign debt and perhaps let it make itscurrency, the dirham, freely convertible in 1993.   The king also will be seeking a few big joint-ventureindustrial projects to help the much-reformed Moroccaneconomy &quot;take off.&quot; And while much of Morocco's futureeconomic development depends on close ties to Europe --Morocco is a few miles from Europe across the Strait ofGibraltar -- the king wants to show off a Morocco open to allforeign investment, after having liberalized its laws andbegun privatizing its industry.   He is also expected to tell President Bush and other U.S.officials that Libya, partner with Morocco, Algeria, Tunisiaand Mauritania in a nascent North African Common Market, iseager to restore normal relations with the U.S. The king saidhe will listen to and relay any U.S. complaints about Libya.   But it is the Middle East that will get most of hisofficial attention. The aftermath of the war has left &quot;worldopinion, and especially Arab opinion, demanding that pastUnited Nations resolutions on the Middle East be respected,&quot;the king said. &quot;Fate has it that President Bush, a man who isfirm, honest and faithful to his ideals, is heading the U.S.Fate has brought us an approach that's serious, a solidplatform that won't slip out from under our feet.&quot;   The king offered lavish praise for Mr. Bush but also urgedthe U.S. to use its post-Gulf War, post-Soviet Union powerwisely, echoing widespread Arab fears and hopes. &quot;Written onthe U.S. dollar, the world's reference currency, is somethingthat assures world security,&quot; the king said. &quot;In God wetrust. The U.S.'s force is that of virtue and morality. If itdoesn't commit the sin of pride, then it is a force thatcannot perish.&quot;   That force, the king said with a candor rarely displayedby either Arab or Israeli leaders, should remain behind theidea of an international peace conference based on U.N.resolutions 242 and 338, &quot;which return the occupiedterritories to their former legal status but alsodefinitively guarantee not only the existence of Israel, butits right to security and peace with its neighbors. This is anew element, which doesn't mean the problem will be solvedimmediately, but the plane is about to take off, and therewon't be any question of it coming back to land, because thatwould be a dangerous stop. It will take off.&quot;   So far, said the king, Morocco's main role in the processhas been to stress to Israel's Arab neighbors that &quot;nothingshould impede the peace process.&quot; He said he backs Mr. Bush'sthreatened veto of immediate U.S. loan guarantees to helpIsrael lodge Soviet Jews in the occupied territories, callingthat veto threat &quot;pressure for a peace conference.&quot;   King Hassan said the planned opening of the conferencenext month still depended on important problems being solved,such as how the Palestinians are represented. He favorseither the Palestinian Liberation Organization, which bothIsrael and the U.S. have rejected, or &quot;people mandated by thePLO. The important thing is that they be credible people, whowon't be writing political checks that later bounce.&quot;   The 62-year-old king, one of the longest-serving Arabmonarchs, has said that he didn't expect Israeli PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir, a veteran of Israel's struggle forindependence, to be able to sign a peace treaty, but that thenext generation of Israeli leaders could do so. &quot;There issuch a thing as irreversible historical momentum,&quot; the kingsaid.   At home, the king is busy reversing some historicalanomalies that have held back Morocco's development.Following two coup attempts in the 1970s and 1980s, the kingarrested and imprisoned dozens of political enemies and,according to human rights groups, detained them in violationof international law. He has recently released a number ofthese prisoners, including Abraham Serfaty, a Moroccancommunist who had been in jail for 17 years. The king alsodemolished the secret prison of Tazmamart, which had longheld former coup plotters. The king hopes that a scheduledreferendum next year in the war-torn former Spanish Sahara,which Morocco claims, will settle a problem that has longtied up Moroccan arms and money.   Following the collapse in the early 1980s of the worldprice for phosphate, Morocco's major natural resource, theking has led a sweeping modernization and privatizationprogram, under the auspices of the IMF. Morocco's foreigndebt has stabilized at about $20 billion, but because theeconomy has grown an average of 5% a year for the past threeyears, that debt as a percentage of Morocco's gross nationalproduct has fallen from a disastrous 130% in 1985 to astill-worrisome 86% now. Morocco now has hard currencyreserves of $2.3 billion, enough to cover more than threemonths of imports. With an IMF agreement and a bit morereserves, the king said, &quot;we might be able to take the riskof making the currency convertible in 1993.&quot;   This would make Morocco much more attractive for foreigninvestors and bring the Third World country closer to theFirst World. &quot;We need three or four big pilot projects, jointventures between Moroccan and foreign companies, to help ustake off,&quot; the king said, &quot;to prove that the rules will berespected, that companies can repatriate their profits andtake their money out when they want to leave.&quot; Officials talkof imminent big investments by Westinghouse Electric Co. in amilitary airplane engine plant and by Motorola Inc., andplans for Morocco's first McDonald's Corp. restaurant soon.   As for Europe, King Hassan said he's still serious aboutapplying for full membership in the European Community,despite the geographic and economic difficulties of this.&quot;Europe used to be a clan, now it's becoming a club,&quot; hesaid. &quot;The EC was built for 300 million consumers. Now, withEastern Europe, Europe will have 700 million consumers, 400million of whom need everything. Where are they going to findthe production for all these people who've landed on theirbacks?&quot; he asks. They should look south. &quot;It's enough forMorocco to equip itself industrially, with the aid of foreignpartners, and we should be able to meet a big part ofEurope's needs. If we're gentlemen, well-raised, and pay ourdebts, why shouldn't we join the club?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
