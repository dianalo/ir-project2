It is shown that boric acid has a fainteffect on water activity (increase of H/sub 3/BO/sub 3/ concentrationfrom 0.1 to 0.9 M decreases water activity only by 0.11). With increaseof the salt concentration water activity in a solution noticeably decreases.More appreciable effect have cations with a larger specific charge.</TEXT></DOC>
