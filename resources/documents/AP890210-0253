He called Thursday for full decontrol of natural gas, are-examination of off-shore oil drilling projects in severalenvironmentally sensitive areas, and four separate tax incentivesaimed at finding new oil and gas fields and reclaiming old ones.   He said tax incentives ``can give the domestic oil and gasindustry the necessary stimulus,'' particularly to the smallproducers ``who are so vital to our energy security. Historically,independent producers have drilled a majority of America'sexploratory wells.''   Bush, however, called an oil import fee protectionist and said itamounts to a tax increase on all energy users.   His four tax incentives would encourage exploration of new oiland gas fields and reclamation of old fields, and would be phasedout if the price of oil reaches $21 a barrel.   The spot price for West Texas crude, the benchmark oil, closed at$17.40 Thursday.   Charles J. DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute,called the tax incentives ``a step in the right direction. But theyalone cannot stem the serious decline in domestic petroleumproduction.''   Other steps are required, including opening to explorationpromising federal lands on shore in Alaska and off shore inCalifornia and Florida, he said.   ``Therefore, it was gratifying to hear once again the presidentendorse access to the coastal plain off the Arctic National WildlifeRefuge in Alaska,'' DiBona said.   Bush's budget would allow new drilling in selected offshore areasand in the Alaska wildlife refuge.   The API, however, ``would be concerned about unnecessary delaysin off-shore leasing'' and believes a prompt review of off-shoreleasing would show that exploration and production is``environmentally safe and should be permitted to proceed,'' DiBonasaid.   While welcomed by another industry official, the measures muststill clear a Congress wrestling with a budget deficit and not knownfor rushing to the industry's defense.   ``It's going to take work. You've got a budget deficit that's ablack hole, and it's difficult to give tax incentives to J.R. Ewing.That's how it plays in the public mind,'' said Barney White, a vicepresident of corporate affairs at Zapata Corp. in Houston, an oildrilling contractor founded by the president.   Wells have been shut down because the costs of production exceedreturns, with the number of rigs falling from more than 4,000 in1981 to less than 1,000 today. Some 150,000 jobs have been lostsince 1986 and domestic production fell from 9.1 million barrels aday to little more than 8.1 billion a day.   Bush's package includes a tax credit on intangible drillingcosts, those not directly associated with drilling a well _ such ashauling equipment. The measure is expected to reduce revenues to theU.S. Treasury by $200 million in fiscal 1990, $300 million in 1991and 1992, and $400 million in 1993.   He also recommends a tax credit for capital expenditures on allnew tertiary enhanced recovery projects _ those that use steam,carbon dioxide or chemical injectants to remove oil and gas fromfields. The measure is expected to reduce revenues by $50 million orless a year.   Tax incentives are proposed to encourage exploration forindependent producers, at an anticipated cost to the government of$100 million a year.   Another element of the plan seeks to change oil and gas depletionrules that discourage the transfer of marginal wells to independentproducers and result in the premature abandonment of producingwells. The loss of federal revenues is estimated at $50 million orless annually.</TEXT></DOC>
