This property supplies a most interesting modelfor the study of host virus interaction and, in particular of additionalsteps possibly involved in carcinogenic mechanisms. New technical advanceshave provided the tools for the precise analysis of the viral geneticinformation and interaction with the host cell: molecular hybridizationand genetic engineering for the study of nucleic acids; potent immunologicaltechniques like the use of synthetic peptides and monoclonal antibodiesas well as in vitro mRNA translation systems for the analysis of viralproteins and their precursor molecules. A precise understanding of themechanisms of viral replication and carcinogenesis is of utmost importancefor the design of efficient therapeutic agents directed against theseviruses and the neoplasms they induce.</TEXT></DOC>
