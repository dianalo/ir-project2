Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., said when askedwhether he has pledges of enough votes to win the debate.   Jenkins talked to reporters after a closed-door Democraticcaucus that leaders said indicated a substantial majority of partymembers oppose a cut in the tax on capital gains, which are profitsfrom the sale of stocks and other investments. However, someacknowledged that if a vote were taken immediately, enoughDemocrats would join a solid bloc of Republicans to pass thereduction.   ``I think a majority of Democrats take the position that weshould not agree to this particular issue,'' said Speaker Thomas S.Foley, D-Wash. ``I believe it's bad tax policy, bad fiscal policy,unwise, inequitable and ill-timed.''   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing Waysand Means Committee, was still trying to win back at least one ofthe six Democrats on the panel who are backing a capital-gains cut.He offered a compromise that, rather than reducing thetax rate,would benefit investors by protecting inflation-caused profitsagainst taxation.   ``Republicans surprised me with how receptive they were'' to hisproposal, Rostenkowski said after briefing members of hiscommittee. He called his plan ``pretty much what I view as apossible compromise where everybody wins.''   His proposal, less generous than Jenkins', would benefit mostassets except preferred stock, stock in foreign corporations, debtinstruments and other intangibles. It would work this way forassets purchased after July 31, 1989:   _If held for more than one year but less than five, the assetwould be ``indexed'' for inflation. That is, total inflation overthe years the property was owned would be subtracted from thepurchase price; thus only the non-inflation gain would be taxed.   _If held for more than five years but less than 10, an investorcould subtract inflation or could exclude from tax 25 percent ofthe sales price.   _If held for more than 10 years, an investor could subtractinflation or 50 percent of the sales price.   ``I think there's a hopeful atmosphere of some kind ofcompromise,'' Rostenkowski told reporters. He suggested the Bushadministration should get more involved in the negotiations.   ``It's very difficult for me to negotiate with the White House,with (Rep. Bill) Archer (a Texan who is senior Republican on Waysand Means) _ I don't know who it is that can say, `OK. We've got anunderstanding.'''   Rep. J.J. Pickle of Texas, one of the six dissident Ways andMeans Democrats, sounded a similar tone. ``Compromise must comefrom the White House,'' Pickle said. ``If they don't, we'll justhave a little shootout.''   The administration already has agreed informally to a compromiseof sorts.   Bush proposed that the maximum tax on capital gains, now 33percent, be reduced to 15 percent. He reasoned that would boostinvestment, create jobs and spur so much economic activity thatgovernment revenues would increase and help reduce the deficit.   There was almost no support among Ways and Means Democrats forthat proposal, so Jenkins and Archer came up with a substitute,which now has the administration's backing.   The Jenkins-Archer proposal would cut the top rate to 19.6percent for two years, then increase it to 28 percent and ensurethat gains caused by inflation would not be taxed.   Democratic leaders oppose a capital-gains rate cut for threereasons: because 80 percent of the benefit would go to investorswith incomes totaling $100,000 a year or more; they say it wouldreduce government revenues after the first year or two, and theyfear that restoring a capital-gains tax preference that wasrepealed as part of the 1986 tax overhaul would lead to theunraveling of that landmark law.   In an effort to block the Jenkins-Archer plan, Rostenkowskioffered a new formula that would prevent taxation ofinflation-caused gains and also give investors at least a slightbreak in the tax on their profits that represented a real increasein the value of property.   However, there was no indication that Rostenkowski's proposalhad drawn any votes away from the Jenkins-Archer plan.   Rep. Jim Moody, D-Wis., who opposes a capital-gains cut,cautioned against concluding that the Jenkins-Archer amendment willcarry the day. ``We are beginning an education campaign'' to pointout issues of fairness in connection with capital gains, Moody said.   ``Time is on the side of the package that will be worked on bythe chairman,'' said Moody. ``He's very sensitive to thepressures.''</TEXT></DOC>
