 What once was a fairly staid market,characterized by the use of Atex systems to produce high-profile titles withlarge circulations and tight deadlines, has been overturned.andP;  Magazinepublishers of all types are purchasing systems to put out a broad variety ofpublications.andP;  And, as we noted in a detailed analysis of this market in thesummer of 1988, the equipment choices are broadening also.andM;The battle for supremacy in this market is far from over.andP;  Atex still has amighty presence, but it is based in large part on historical achievements.andO;Its new system for smaller magazines, called PC Page Makeup, has been stalledat the starting gate since the middle of last year.andP;  Meanwhile, on this sideof the Atlantic, Bestinfo is reaping some of the Benefits of Atex's slowdown,and Compatible Systems Engineering has just staked a claim for its share ofthe market with a key sale to Ziff-Davis for producing PC Week.andP;  Magna haslet it be known that it would like a piece of the magazine pie with its newinteractive page layout system.andP;  Like LaserMaker, they both run on PCnetworks.andM;In the UK, LaserMaker has emerged as a formidable force, spurred by huge,recent orders from Morgan-Grampian, which were won initially in a competitivebattle with Bestinfo.andP;  Also making some noise in the UK market is APTSystems, which has started to receive some key orders.andM;There are other players also, including Penta, Miles and perhaps Bedford,with companies such as Compugraphic ready with new products that may findtheir way into this market as color becomes more important.andP;  And there isCybergraphic, which has gained some prominence with its installation at theNational daily sports tabloid.andM;LaserMaker today.andP;  The case of LaserMaker is a particularly interesting onefor several reasons.andP;  Taking a broad view of the market and its role,LaserMaker has its eyes set on both magazines and newspapers, and on theworld market.andP;  It has installed systems in 20 countries, although most of itsPC networks are located in England -- plus one each in the U.S., Italy andIsrael.andM;Laser/Maker also is beginning to offer total systems, rather than justeditorial/composition products.andP;  A couple of years ago, it began to addressthe market for creating display ads by integrating a product developed byAdvent.andP;  At Drupa this year, LaserMaker is adding a classified ad system thatrounds out its newspaper offering nicely.andM;In this issue, we are taking a close look at the current editorial/pagelayout offering from LaserMaker.andP;  The newest developments since our lastvisit to this firm from the British Midlands are solid network support and acapable interactive page layout program.andM;In our last report (see Vol.andP;  17, No.andP;  3), we covered many aspects ofLaserMaker's composition system, so we won't repeat all of the details foundin that article.andP;  Instead, we'll concentrate on how the PC system handlesfile management and copy routing on the network and how its interactive pagelayout facilities work.andP;  We suggest that any readers interested in thecompany's history and its traditional composition capabilities look back atour earlier article.andM;We'll also look briefly at the company's key sales, including seven customersin Europe with more than 50 PCs, plus the first sale of a networked system inthe U.S., which is being used for newspaper pagination.andP;  The New Brunswick(NJ) Home News is using nine LaserMaker workstations to produce full pages ofnews input on its old Digital Equipment TMS-11 system, which now serves as aword processor feeding the LaserMaker PCs.andM;In spite of these significant contracts, LaserMaker's U.S.andP;  operation isstill crawling along, waiting for a breakthrough that would put it alongsideAtex, Bestinfo and some other vendors as the key players in this market.andM;Will that happen?andP;  LaserMaker says it is looking for a strong U.S.andP;  partnerto give it a boost.andP;  It has had a link with IBM for two years, but withoutgaining many new sales from it.andM;The product appears ready for the U.S.andP;  (All references to copy tasting havebeen removed.andP;  Queue names are completely customizable, so there is no needfor a queue for subediting).andM;As the following review will make note, LaserMaker has developed a productwith some remarkable characteristics.andP;  In ease of use, it stands head andshoulders (and chest and stomach) above Bestinfo.andP;  In productivy, it standsequally far above the desktop programs that were designed for novices andstill find themselves coming up short when asked to tackle heavy productionloads -- short in their network functionality and in their facilities formeeting exacting needs in lightning-fast ways.andM;Platform and pricingandM;The LaserMaker product line, which overall is called Leaps (Layout, Editorialand Production Systems), includes LM-Type, a text processor with interactivehandamp;j and style tags; LM-Page, a design and layout system for manipulating thelayout interactively; LM-Studio, a workstation for creating display ads,based on a cooperative development with Advent; and LM-Advert, for real-timeentry of classified advertising and a range of accounting tasks.andM;The recommended hardware for LM-Type is a '286 PC with a hard disk and 512Kof memory beyond the basic 640K.andP;  But it will run on an 8086 PC and itdoesn't require a hard disk.andP;  A nice configuration is a '386 unit with 2 MBof RAM.andM;LM-Page requires a '386 with 2 MB of RAM and a 19-inch Monitor.andP;  A minimumserver should have a '386 processor, 2 MB of RAM, a hard disk and tapebackup.andM;The preferred network for most users is Novell Netware, but some systems arerunning on 3Com and PC Lan networks also.andP;  LaserMaker calls its system&quot;network transparent.&quot;andM;It supports a variety of monitors, including the Moniterm Viking, theHercules graphics card and the Etap high-resolution display.andP;  With one of thelarger screens, the editing window can be run alongside the page view formore effective operation, but a small screen will suffice.andP;  With a largescreen, the editing window also can be run in a choice of two sizes: tiny andhuge.andP;  &quot;Tiny&quot; is the size of display when a page file is viewed next to thetext window -- about 8 inches diagonally, or almost as big as the originalMacintosh scree.andP;  &quot;Huge&quot; uses the full 21-inch screen for text.andM;When run with a large Viking monitor, the small PC monitor serves only insystem setup.andP;  All text and layout operations use the large monitor.andM;Pricing.andP;  LaserMaker sells its systems as software only or bundled with IBMhardware.andP;  As an individual, software-only package, LM-Type costs 1,990pounds in the UK or $2,850 in the U.S.andP;  for each of the first nine copies,1,490 pounds in the UK for the 10th thrugh 29th, down to 490 pounds ($850 inthe U.S.) for the 60th.andM;LM-Page is priced at 3,990 pounds in the UK ($6,350 in the U.S.) for each ofthe first three, 2,990 pounds each up to nine, 1,990 pounds up to 29, and 990pounds ($1,600 in the U.S.) for the 30th and beyond.andM;LM-Studio, the display ad package, costs 6,490 pounds ($9,500 in the U.S.)andO;for one to three copies.andM;A 10-terminal networked system consisting of eight PS/2 Model 55 stationsrunning LM-Type, two Model 70s with Moniterm Viking monitors running LM-Pageand a Model 80 file server, plus all networking hardware and software,installation and training, would cost about 85,000 pounds ($139,000).andM;Sales and support.andP;  LaserMaker's headquarters is in Nottingham, England.andP;  Ithas a subsidiary in Manhattan Beach, California, and distributors in Germany,France, Italy and Sweden.andM;In addition to its regular support operation in the UK and the U.S.,andO;LaserMaker is implementing a remote support package to allow technicians andsupport personnel in the home office to assit users around the world.andP;  CalledLM-Link, it will run in unattended mode and on networks or standalonesystems.andP;  It is already running in the U.S.andP;  with Home News.andM;File managementandM;The file management system is based on MS-DOS functionality, but LaserMakerhas enhanced it considerably by adding features for copy flow and directorygeneration appropriate for the multiuser environments and the magazinemarket.andM;The heart of the system is the flexible story header, which can be customizedfor a given site and which serves as a means of generating selectivedirectories.andP;  Also notable is the easy means of calling up stories andswitching queues -- moving the cursor over the story or queue name andstriking ENTER.andM;The system is based on macros that can be customized to serve particularusers' needs.andP;  The header fields can be changed, as can the items on the filemenu.andP;  We will describe the standard system that we used.andM;Each story is given a 10-character &quot;catch&quot; or name, although the systemautomatically assigns it an identification number also.andP;  The user generallyworks with the catch, not the number, although sometimes the number comes inhandy, such as in differentiating between different files that have the samename (which is legal because the system uses the ID, not the catch, as itsname).andP;  The catch can never be changed, not even by renaming the file.andM;There is a second field, for a 15-character comment about the story, thataids in identifying it.andM;To the user, it appears that the system uses a hierarchical file structuresimilar to most DOS-based systems.andP;  However, in actuality, all text files areheld in the same directory.andP;  We don't know the reason for this -- itcertainly results in some long directories on disk.andP;  Not only are there thecurrent versions of all active files, but there also are several earlierversions stored as backups.andP;  We didn't have any problem with the number offiles we created, but we can imagine some situations in which hundreds offiles are held in the same directory.andM;The user isn't aware of the internal storage system, though, because of themanner in which directories are set up and files are accessed.andP;  The system isbuilt around the idea of sequential copy flow that moves stories successivelyfrom one stage of production to another, with each stage having its owndirectory of stories at that stage in the cycle.andP;  Thus, any directory thatcan be called up consists of a small subset of the files in the entiredirectory because it is built using the various fields in the header.andM;Among the fields in the header are some that are supplied by the system (fileID, current queue or production stage, story depth, etc.) and some that arefilled in by the user (story name and comment, tray or desk, issue of thepublication to which the story is assigned, and so on).andM;This header information and some convenient function-key labels are the keysto getting around the system.andM;Accessing files.andP;  General file management functions (create a new file, callup an old one, save the current file, etc.) are handled through function keyslabeled at the bottom of the screen.andP;  When the user enters the textapplication and asks to edit a file, the system displays a list of file areasavailable.andP;  These are customizable for a particular site, but generally theyare likely to include a personal queue, in which stories can be written androuted to the appropriate desk, and the other stages of production set up bythe system manager, such as a queue for stories that have been written (butnot edited), stories that have been edited (but not placed on a page),stories that have been placed on a page (but not typeset), etc.andM;Access to personal queues is restricted to the specific user who owns thelogon.andP;  Access to other queues or desks is controlled by security provisionsassociated with each logon.andM;The queues available to the user who is logged on appear as single-lineentries on the screen.andP;  Any of these queues can be entered by moving thecursor to the queue name and striking the ENTER key.andM;As the user enters one of these queues, the system offers an opportunity togenerate a directory of all stories in that queue or a more selectivedirectory built to specifications using the header fields.andP;  For example, allstories in the queue that have been assigned to the April issue can bedisplayed in a directory generated by typing &quot;April&quot; in the issue field.andP;  Afield can be filled out with partial entries, such as &quot;Ap&quot; to get a list ofall stories for the Ap 10 and Ap 20 issues.andP;  In addition, wildcards can bespecified: &quot;file?sys&quot; to get versions file1sys, file2sys and file3sys.andM;LaserMaker adds a nice twist to the directory that is generated in thisfashion: the option of switching to a different queue instead of selectingone of the displayed file names.andP;  This can be done very easily because at thebottom of the directory are listed the available queues.andP;  The operator canmove the cursor beyond the list of files and select a different queueinstead, which introduces the possibility of getting a new directory of filesfrom that queue.andM;It is currently possible to generate selective directories of jobs residingin different queues, but files displayed in this kind of directory arerestricted to read-only privileges.andP;  So this works well for functions such asgetting a status report on all stories for a particular issue, but then theuser would have to get a new directory to call up any of the stories.andM;There are a couple of shortcomings of the current file system.andP;  One is thelack of a long directory to show some of the text of the story as well as theheader.andP;  The other is the restricted sort order.andP;  Entries appear inalphabetical order, which is reasonable for a default condition, but theorder can't be changed, even by changing the story name to get it to sortdifferently, because there is no facility for changing the name.andP;  It would benice to add a sort field to enable sorting the directory in different ways atdifferent times.andP;  (LaserMaker says it is looking into this possibility.)andO;Also nice would be a long directory to show actual lines of text from eachstory, although the 10- and 15-character names and comments serve as areasonable substitute for a long directory.andM;Routing stories.andP;  After a story has been written or any time it is called up,the operator gets a chance to specify the queue in which it will be storedand any changes that are to be made in the header information.andM;This is the basis for routing copy from one desk or queue to another.andP;  Theuser who finishes working on a story sends it manually to the next stage.andM;As files are moved from one queue to another, they leave the previous queue.andO;The system doesn't create a new file each time one moves.andP;  If a user wants toretrieve a file already sent to its next destination, it is possible to dothat, providing that user's logon permits access to the queue in which thestory has been sent.andM;The story header indicates the queue that the story came from.andM;There are no automatic facilities whereby stories filed by a reporter godirectly to the next step without the user specifying where they are to go(although stories that have been typeset are automatically sent to a queue offinished jobs).andM;But the system is logical, easy to use and effective.andP;  We wish some otherPC-based composition systems running on Novell networks would provide similarfacilities.andP;  (Are you there, Fred and Bert?)andM;Backup.andP;  LaserMaker automatically saves open files at intervals specified ona user logon basis.andP;  Besides the current version, the system keeps the mostrecent version of the file and two earlier ones.andP;  LaserMaker has designed anautomatic backup system for its most important initial customer,Morgan-Grampian, that automatically writes all files to a second disk.andP;  Thisfacility is being made available to other customers also.andM;With the standard system, there is a feature for restoring an earlier versionof a file from disk, although on the one occasion we needed it, it didn'twork.andM;Other functions.andP;  A few additional file management functions are availablethrough the same menu structure that is used elsewhere.andP;  These enabledeleting files from a directory display.andM;There are no facilities for renaming or copying files within the program, butit is possible to escape to DOS from within the layout program (but not fromthe text editor) and perform DOS operations.andM;Files can be imported easily through a separate function, while no files areopen.andP;  It isn't possible to import a file and insert it into an open file inone command.andP;  The import routine can handle some word processor codes, but itdoesn't offer as good facilities as are found on programs such as theoff-the-shelf data conversion programs from Blueberry Software and EmulationTechnologies, which are recommended by LaserMaker for sophisticated dataconversion.andP;  The only way we were able to import XyWrite files was bystripping out mode commands (font calls).andM;Multiuser file functions.andP;  When a file is open on one user's screen, it islocked to any other user on the network.andP;  What actually happens is that thefile is temporarily moved into the user's personal queue, so not only is itlocked, but it disappears from the working queue it was in.andP;  If another userwith appropriate access privileges snoops around long enough to find it insomeone's personal queue and tries to call it up, the system displays amessage saying the file is locked.andP;  This works, although we wonder how manyheart attacks will be suffered when a key story that was in its proper queueseconds ago suddenly disappears.andP;  (Even the most trusting system user surelyknows that files can get eaten for no apparent reason.)andP;  LaserMaker says itimplemented the program this way in response to a request from a user andhasn't seen any need to change it.andM;The same philosophy holds for page templates (groups of pages being treatedas one entity, as we will describe later) in that if one layout editor isworking on a layout, no other user can call up the same pages.andP;  However, itis possible for a different user to call up a file from one of those pages,as we will note in the section on page layout and copy management.andM;There is a &quot;view&quot; facility that enables any user to call up a directory offiles in any other queue on the system, including anyone else's personalqueue, and get read-only access to those files.andP;  We wonder at what point theterm &quot;personal&quot; no longer applies.andM;There currently is no way for one user to get a list of files that are openon other users' screens or to know what tasks are under way, as compositionsystems traditionally have done.andP;  LaserMaker says it might be able to includein its directory listings a column for files that are locked, similar to thecurrent one telling which stories have been assigned to pages.andM;User interfaceandM;LaserMaker has done well in taking a traditional composition system andgiving it a modern look.andP;  It uses attractive menus, online help features, anice means of accessing special characters from the keyboard, a smoothtransition between the monospaced editing/composition mode and the preview,and the layout functionality that we will discuss later.andM;But it doesn't look like a Macintosh.andP;  And it never will look like aMacintosh because its design philosophy is aimed a significant notch abovethe mass-market products both in its approach to productivity and in itspresumptions about the sophistication of its users.andP;  In short, LaserMakerpresumes that its customers know enough about text composition to avoidaltogether the use of dialog boxes for specifying items such as fonts, sizesand leading.andP;  But it employs menus and other interface aids effectivelyenough to be far easier to use than programs such as Bestinfo's Wave4 andUltimate's Professional Publishing System.andP;  And from a file management/copyrouting perspective, it is more sophisticated and yet easier to use thanMagna's MagnaFile.andM;Lacking dialog boxes for specifying fonts and sizes, LaserMaker asks theoperator to type a string of commands in the command line: &quot;p10&quot; for 10-pointtype, &quot;f41&quot; for font 41, &quot;19&quot; for leading of 9, etc.andP;  Other notablecharacteristics of the user interface -- both positive and negative sides --include:andM;* There are no picture icons for calling up files or going into text mode.andO;Instead there are words and function keys with labels.andM;* All editing is done in a monospaced text window, not on the WYSIWYG displayor even using proportionally spaced, monosized text.andP;  LaserMaker chose thiscourse to maximize speed, which is impressive.andP;  It does show true lineendings at all times and it does a few other nice things, such as displayingcentered lines centered.andM;* There are no scroll bars for advancing through a page or story that islarger than the display.andP;  Instead, the cursor brings in new text when it isdriven off the edge of the screen -- long a preference of some of ourwriters, at least for short documents.andM;* The font display for the preview uses generic fonts that are far from finaloutput in their appearance.andM;* Some of its edition conventions are reminiscent more of WordStar than of amodern editing program (ALT D W to delete a word).andM;All things considered, we think LaserMaker has done well in balancing ease ofuse with productivity issues to develop a system that should have appeal topeople who need the productivity but want a relatively modern user interface.andO;We'll have more comments later regarding how the program's user interfaceworks in areas such as page layout.andP;  Here we'll elaborate on the userinterface as it relates to the main text composition program.andM;Text mode display and keyboard.andP;  When the program is entered, the user has achoice of modules to use, including text entry and composition, page layout,any of the libraries used for storing elements such as tags (formats) andpage layouts, and special functions (unlocking locked files).andP;  These areselectable from labeled function keys at the bottom of the screen.andM;In text mode, commands are entered on the command line at the top of thescreen, with text displayed in monospaced format.andP;  Commands can be suppressedor diaplayed, as has always been the case with LaserMaker.andP;  If they aresuppressed, a white rectangle appears behind the character tha immediatelyfollows an embedded command.andP;  As the cursor moves over the rectangle, thecontents of the command are displayed on the command line, making it easy tosee what lurks within.andP;  If commands are displayed in the text portion, theyappear in reverse video.andM;Another classic feature of LaserMaker is the rotating status information areaat the top of the screen.andP;  Three lines of information can be cycled throughin the form of four sets of data: (1) typographic parameters, copy depth andline length remaining as the counting keyboard runs; (2) kerning and handamp;jstatus; (3) file name, issue, page, line number, whether the file has beenchanged since it was called up and amount of overmatter if the story islonger than its page frame; and (4) the queue the story came from and itsframe identification (if any).andP;  One set is always present; others can beaccessed by command (ALT F6).andM;The bottom of the screen displays the operations available through thefunction keys, including the clipboard for cutting and pasting up to 62 textblocks, search/replace, soft-copy preview, spelling checker and fileoperations.andP;  These are logical and consistent functions throughout theprogram.andM;Keyboard.andP;  To access characters not found on the main keyboard, Laser/Makerhas adopted a popup keyboard function much like the Macintosh keycapsroutine.andP;  The ALT key plus any of the 10 digits brings up a different set ofspecial characters that can be accessed by using the keys as pictured on thescreen.andM;LaserMaker also offers a routine for changing some of the functions on thekeyboard to suit certain ingrained habits from a word processor.andP;  In the caseof XyWrite, LaserMaker has chosen not to enable copying of some of thekeyboard functions because it would involve low-level keyboard &quot;tricks&quot; thatcould result in incompatibilities with other devices, which it didn't want todo.andP;  It should be possible to use a third-party keyboard enhancer to do thesame tricks, but LaserMaker hasn't done that.andP;  We had to unlearn some XyWritehabits in order to write this article using the LaserMaker editor -- whichisn't bad, but it isn't XyWrite, either.andM;Operator feedback.andP;  Feedback to the operator is good.andP;  When an invalidcommand is entered, the system beeps, places the cursor on the problem andrefuses to accept it, rather than taking the Bestinfo approach of allowingthe invalid code to go through until the job is output, at which time Wave4hangs and sends the operator back on an arduous search for the error, whichcould be in any of several different places.andM;If the operator attempts to delete a block that begins or ends with anembedded command, LaserMaker politely asks if the command is to be deleted orretained -- an improvement over the XyWrite method of automatically deletingthe command, thus possibly throwing the rest of the story into the wrongfont.andM;There is an online help program that we had worked with previously, but wewere unable to access it with the software version we were running, so wecan't make any comments about it.andM;Documentation.andP;  The documentation we worked with was helpful but it wasincomplete.andP;  It provided a useful tutorial in how to perform variousoperations, but it wasn't a very good reference for some of our concerns.andP;  Ithas no index.andP;  Besides the tutorial, the manual has sections forinstallation, commands and editing.andP;  Some earlier references we used haveuseful lists of commands, but, again, no index.andM;LaserMaker says it has sorted out its documentation situation and it nowshould be adequate.andM;Word processing functionsandM;LaserMaker provides its own editing program that, the company says, is thepreferred mode of operation for all of its customers.andP;  It has some nicefeatures, but we miss the XyWrite convention for the left arrow key to moveone space to the left normally, one word to the left when ALT is pressed andto the left end of the line when CONTROL is pressed.andP;  Similarly, XyWrite usesALT plus DELETE to delete a word and CONTROL plus DELETE to erase a line --producing a consistency based on ALT for words and CONTROL for lines.andM;LaserMaker enables moving a word at a time to the left with ALT L W, whichworks but which requires more keystrokes and which is much more difficult tostrike.andP;  (Try it.andP;  It is more complicated, although it has the advantages ofbeing mnemonic and of letting the fingers stay closer to the home keys.)andO;We'd much rather see a precedence key plus a single key.andP;  LaserMaker'simplementation can be changed, so different customers undoubtedly will set uptheir systems in different ways.andP;  But LaserMaker says it hasn't adopted theuse of ALT with the arrow keys because it wants to ensure compatibility withinternational keyboards.andM;Fortunately, LaserMaker uses the common convention for displaying the cursoras a flashing rectable when in insert mod and an underline when inoverstrike.andP;  It also has another feature we like: as the cursor movesvertically, it attempts to retain its horizontal position (similar toPageMaker, Magna and a few other systems), rather than jumping to the leftmargin and staying there when it encounters a short line.andM;The delete function is similar to the cursor movement.andP;  It requires threekeystrokes to delete a word, line or paragraph.andP;  (ALT D W deletes a word.)andO;There is no means of deleting a word backwards.andP;  LaserMaker does have onefeature not often found elsewhere: delete a command (ALD D C).andM;The arrow keys move one character at a time in each of the four directionsand the HOME and END keys go to the beginning and end of the open file.andP;  ThePAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys move a screenful at a time, or actually a halfscreen, because the cursor always rests on the middle line on the screen --as it always has done with LaserMaker.andM;Clipboard.andP;  Up to 62 blocks may be saved under the upper-and lower-casealphabetic characters and the numbers and accessed by striking the same keyfrom clipboard mode.andP;  The operator first places the cursor on top of thebeginning character in the block, then indicates which storage area is to beused, and finally moves the cursor to the end of the block and specifieswhether the block is to be deleted from the screen or to remain after it isstored.andM;The operator can find out what is stored under each of the 62 characters inturn by entering clipboard mode, typing the character and reading the messageline (which displays the first 74 characters).andM;Items on the clipboard, which are specific to each user, initially are storedin memory and are deleted when the user exits the program.andP;  However, they canbe stored on disk in &quot;libraries&quot; and brought back into memory at a latertime.andM;During clipboard operations, the screen provides nice prompts.andM;User-defined keys (macros).andP;  Besides the clipboard, text can be stored underuser-defined keys, or macros, which also can be put into libraries andretrieved later.andP;  UDKs, which are stored as they are typed, can includekeyboard operations as well as text and commands.andM;Search/replace.andP;  Facilities for searching and replacing text are excellentand consistent with the rest of the product in their user interface.andP;  Theysupport forward and backward searching, case sensitivity, locating wholewords only, and global and discretionary operation.andM;There are two wildcard features.andP;  One, the asterisk, enables searching forwhole words that start or end with particular character strings, so it isn'tnecessary to specify how many characters the wildcard represents.andP;  The otherone, the question mark, represents a single character anywhere within astring.andP;  It can be used multiple times within the same string.andP;  There is aprovision for using either the asterisk or the question mark as its owncharacter, rather than a wildcard.andM;Another nice feature of the routine is that it is able to find a specifiedstring even if a command or a line ending is embedded within the string --something XyWrite can't do.andP;  It is possible also to search for a string withan embeded command by typing the string as such on the command line.andM;The speed of searching and replacing is acceptable.andM;As with other functions, the screen provides nice prompts for running searchand replace.andM;Spelling checker.andP;  LaserMaker has integrated its own spelling checker intothe program.andP;  It runs interactively by command, starting from the cursorlocation and continuing to the end of the file.andP;  It accesses the masterdictionary and an auxiliary user dictionary if one is specified (plus adictionary of &quot;skips&quot; -- words that are temporarily not to be flagged.andM;As the program works, it flashes very quickly each word in the command areaas it checks them.andP;  When it encounters one that isn't in the dictionary, itstops on that word, reports a potential error, and displays the nextsequential word in the dictionary after the suspected erroneous word.andP;  Theoperator then has the opportunity to skip the word (and thereby add it to theskips dictionary so it won't be flagged again until the skips dictionary iscleared), to add it to the auxiliary dictionary, to insert the alternativeword that is displayed, or to retype the word to correct it.andP;  Those arereasonable options, and much of the program is good.andP;  But it has a fewshortcomings.andP;  First, words currently can't be added to the main dictionary,so each user will have to add the same words to his or her auxiliary lists.andO;LaserMaker says it is prepared to ship to users the tools needed to add wordsto the main dictionary to avoid this problem.andM;Second, the suggested alternative usually isn't the correct word; it ismerely the next word that appears in the dictionary.andP;  So, for example, if wespell &quot;psychology&quot; without the &quot;P&quot;, the suggested alternative is&quot;sycophancy.&quot;andP;  And if we use &quot;fisical,&quot; it suggests neither &quot;physical,&quot; asmany programs would do, nor &quot;fiscal,&quot; which is pretty close.andP;  Instead, itproposes &quot;fissile.&quot;andP;  LaserMaker says it is planning to improve this facilityby incorporating a better scheme.andM;Third, the program doesn't handle hyphenated words properly.andP;  It stops onevery occurrence of a compound word that hasn't been put in the dictionary asa compound word.andP;  Similarly, contractions (aren't, isn't) need to be addedalso because the master dictionary comes without them.andM;A nice feature is that, besides the routine for checking the text, theprogram enables the operator to look up words by typing them in the commandarea.andM;Fast, improved compositionandM;As has been the case with LaserMaker since its beginning, the compositionprogram runs in continuously counting mode, keeping up even with a fasttypist.andP;  As we have stated before, the composition capabilities are generallyconsistent with traditional typography-oriented systems.andP;  It providesautomatic kerning and tracking, control over minimum and maximum interwordspace (but it doesn't use the optimum space as its justification target), andmost of the commands associated with code-driven systems.andP;  Among these arebaseline jumps, mark and return to mark, modification of the set sizeindependent of the point size, and generation of round- or square-corneredboxes and boxes with diagonal rules through them (dependent, of course, onthe output devices's capabilities).andM;The command line, which is used to enter all commands, can include comments(nontypesetting notes) for other operators to read when they receive thestory.andP;  Comments, which can be embedded anywhere within the file, appear inthe command line when the cursor passes over the command callout.andM;The LM system supports vertical justification applied within a specifiedarea, with the system adding space (but not removing space) to fill the area.andM;Recent enhancements.andP;  Since our last review of the system, LaserMaker hasmade some significant changes to the composition program, including supportfor small caps, superior/inferior characters, and fractions, plus suppressionof double spaces and output of galleys in page-length pieces for proofing.andM;The handamp;j program now supports automatic letterspacing and an enhancedline-breaking routine.andM;The new routine is based on algorithms and practices developed in conjunctionwith Computer Hyphenation Ltd. of the UK.andP;  It assigns a &quot;value rating&quot; oneach potential hyphenation point in a word, ranging from 1 to 12.andP;  Adiscretionary hyphen, which should always be an appropriate place to break aword, gets a rating of 12.andP;  Natural breaks, such as em dashes, are rated 11.andO;Hyphenation points that come from the user's exception dictionary get 10.andM;Other hyphenation points from the main dictionary have been provided byComputer Hyphenation.andP;  Each possible break point within a word is given arating to indicate the desirability of breaking the word at that point.andP;  Thisis much like the preferential systems provided by vendors such as CircleNoetic Services.andM;If, for example, the word &quot;discontinues&quot; is given values of 6, 3 and 4 at itspossible break points, the user can prevent the worst points from being usedby specifying that only points rated level 4 and higher be used.andP;  Setting alower number increases the hyphenation, but at the expense of quality of wordbreaks.andM;Because of the complex nature of this routine and the fact that some of thesettings are fixed by the system, it is difficult to change a certainvariable and see how it affects the overall results.andP;  We hope these pagesprovide a good enough indication of the quality now achievable with thesystem.andP;  We have noticed that the quality of hyphenation has improveddramatically compared with when we produced our earlier review.andP;  Balance inword space seems better also, although we fixed a couple of lines that wereunaccountably loose.andM;Loose lines, of course, are flagged by the system in reverse video in thefile header when the cursor crosses the loose line.andP;  The interword spacevalue applied on each line is displayed there also.andP;  This is a feature notavailable on most systems today.andM;One area LaserMaker hasn't addressed is aesthetic ragged setting.andP;  Itcurrently quads all lines based on the optimum value set by the user.andM;A few of the company's plans in the composition field are discussed laterunder &quot;Futures.&quot;andM;Tagging system.andP;  LaserMaker supports a tagging system much like theformatting capabilities used in many traditional systems.andP;  Tags are namedformats containing typographic parameters -- font, size, leading, etc.andP;  Theycan contain only commands, not text strings, which is a disadvantage incertain applications, although frames can be used to store text strings andachieve a similar purpose (see layout, below).andM;After tags are created, they are stored in groups called libraries.andP;  There isno limit to the number of tags that can be kept in a library, or in thenumber of libraries that can be created on the system.andP;  When the operatorwants to compose the text to the correct format, he or she specifies thelibrary from which the definitions are to be accessed, unless it is the mainlibrary that is loaded automatically when the system is brought up.andP;  Thedefinitions are then read into memory and the text is formatted accordingly.andO;To change to a different format, the operator need only load a different taglibrary.andP;  Thus, LaserMaker formats function very much like the style sheetsin common use, except that they don't include some of the page layoutinformation that comes from templates or master pages.andP;  LaserMaker's tagsdon't specify page size and orientation, areas to be used for graphics, andother layout-oriented information.andP;  But they do include all of the keytypographic features of the system.andM;Thus, it is possible for keyboard entry persons working within another wordprocessing program to tag raw input in a consistent manner (&quot;txt&quot; for allbody text, &quot;hl&quot; for all first-level heads, and so on) and to have the tags betranslated in different ways for different publications.andP;  The keyboardersdon't have to know anything about the destination of their input.andM;The system manager running the LaserMaker program sets up a tagging system bycreating tags with names and command definitions, very much like commonstored formats have been used with composition systems for decades.andP;  Theprogram currently doesn't provide documentation on how to halt a format inthe middle to insert text from the keyboard, although this is a capability ofthe system.andP;  LaserMaker says it is polishing up the feature and thedocumentation to make it possible for all users to do this.andM;Tags can be nested.andM;One shortcoming of the tagging system is that the user doesn't have thebenefit of system variables to aid in handling complex operations throughtags.andP;  For example, it isn't possible to change point size to a certainamount less than the current size, whatever that may be, which could be doneif the system variable for point size were accessible.andP;  Or actions could betaken based on the current baseline position, if this system variable wereaccessible.andP;  (LaserMaker says it will consider offering this kind of functionin the future.)andM;Besides storing tags in a library, tags can be defined at the beginning of afile and used later in that file.andM;Measurements.andP;  LaserMaker is quite flexible in handling different units ofmeasure.andP;  It supports picas and points, ciceros and didots, inches andmillimeters.andP;  The user selects one as the default, which is accessed withoutspecifying any units.andP;  If other measuring systems are to be used in the samestory, they can be specified with a precedence code: andamp; for ciceros, ! forinches and % for millimeters.andM;Tabular composition.andP;  The tab program is capable, providing straightforward(and traditional) means for setting up columns and gutters.andP;  It is quite easyto flow running text into columns, with automatic adjustments for leading sothat columns align properly.andP;  It is also possible to specify the depth oftext columns and have the system automatically flow text from one column tothe text.andM;Up to 30 columns can be set for any table.andP;  The column definition includesthe amount of indent with respect to the left margin, the gutter, the widthof the column, the depth (if known, such as in setting up page depth),justification and whether to advance to the next column or not.andP;  Reasonabledefaults are in effect to cover items not defined.andP;  It isn't possible to havefont or size changes included in tab definitions.andM;There are no facilities for creating straddle heads, automaticallycalculating column widths or alignment based on characters such as decimalpoints.andM;Soft-copy previewandM;Besides the display of text in actual position within the page layoutprogram, which we will discuss shortly, there is a soft-copy preview that canbe accessed at any time while writing or working on a story.andP;  The previewuses only four fonts (sans serif versions of Roman, italic, bold and bolditalic) and approximate sizes (six sizes for text up to 14 points, scaledsizes above that).andP;  When actual sizes aren't used, the preview appears totake some space out between words and some between characters, as needed tomake the overall line length accurate (see photo at right).andP;  So the previewis useful for showing indents, changes in point size, etc., but it isn'tuseful in checking word or character spacing.andP;  In this example, noteparticularly the photo of the tenth line.andM;This is text set at 6 points.andP;  This is text set at 7 points.andP;  This is textset at 8 points.andP;  This is text set at 8.5 points.andP;  This is text set at 9points.andP;  This is text set at 9.5 points.andP;  This is text set at 10 points.andO;This is text set at 10.5 points.andP;  This is text set at 11 points.andP;  This istext set at 9 points with 6-point width.andP;  This is text set at 9 points with7-point width.andP;  This is text set at 9 points with 8-point width.andP;  This istext set at 9 points with 8.5-point width.andP;  This is text set at 9 points with9-point width.andP;  This is text set at 9 points with 9.5-point width.andP;  This istext set at 9 Points with 10-point width.andP;  This is text set at 9 points with12-pt.andP;  width.andP;  This is text set at 9 pts., 15-pt.andP;  widthandM;The preview has some nice features not found on a lot of soft-copy previews.andO;Each of the screens has a cursor, which tracks the other screen's cursorconstantly.andP;  This feature provides a quick means of returning tothe text fileand making editing changes.andP;  If a mistake is noted on the preview screen, theuser can return quickly to the editing screen, find the cursor in the samelocation, make the change and preview the file again.andP;  In this situation, thefile has to be reprocessed and repainted in its entirety, which takes as muchtime as it takes initially to preview it.andP;  The preview's cursor appears as athick cross.andM;While the preview is displayed, the text area disappears to make room for thepreview, but a status window remains at the top to report the x/y position ofthe cursor, the size of the window, the name of the story and some otherinformation that is relevant primarily only when in layout mode.andP;  The statuswindow can be cycled between three different displays.andM;The preview can be zoomed to any percentage specified or displayed to fit alltext on the screen.andP;  It will display graphics as well as text.andP;  If the texttakes up more space than fits on the screen, the operator can view theundisplayed parts by driving the cursor off the screen, which scrolls quicklyto change the display area.andP;  There are no scroll bars.andM;The preview is a little slow, but not as slow as some we've seen.andP;  It takesabout 10 seconds to display one column of text appearing on a page of thisarticle at actual size.andP;  After previewing, returning to text mode is quick.andM;Setting up page structureandM;LaserMaker's layout program, which was designed primarily for magazine-typeapplications, provides good facilities for laying out pages interactively andmaking adjustments to the layout on the page.andP;  It also offers relatively easyaccess to the editing program for making corrections during the layoutprocess.andM;It supports any number of master page layouts, which can be stored andreused.andP;  It handles any number of stories on the same page.andP;  It flows textaround rectangular shapes placed interactively on the page.andP;  It provides goodfacilities for placing elements exactly.andM;Its limitations include not generating new pages automatically, notincrementing page numbers automatically, not checking for widows and orphans,not generating continuation messages automatically, and not allowing editingon the WYSIWYG page.andM;Templates.andP;  The page design process centers on building page templates thatserve as a &quot;blank slate&quot; on which master page designs and frames are placed.andO;A template must indicate the size of the pages to be designed and the numberof pages that will be included.andP;  It optionally can include frames for text,rules, and so on, although these are often placed on master pages.andM;Any number of sets of templates can be created and stored, ready to beaccessed when a new publication is started.andM;Master pages.andP;  There is no limit to the number of master pages that can becreated for use with any publication or with multiple publications.andP;  They arestored in sets called &quot;libraries&quot; that can be accessed by library name.andP;  Eachpage within a library also has a name that is used to access that page designfor use in a publication.andM;Master pages can contain anything that can be produced by the system -- text,graphics, running headers and footers, etc.andP;  One major restriction is thatpage numbers can't be incremented automatically.andP;  Places can be created forthem, but the numbers must be inserted manually.andM;Master pages are used in conjunction with page templates to produce the basicstructure of a page.andP;  The user calls up the template, which contains thenumber of pages in the publication, and assigns each page a master pageformat by calling for it by name.andP;  Thus, to generate alternating left andright pages, the user selects the first left-hand page and calls for theverso master format, selects the first right-hand page and calls for therecto format, and then goes on to the next left-hand page, and so forth.andO;Special master pages can be inserted as needed.andM;Other elements in the library.andP;  Besides page designs, these libraries cancontain other elements that can be called in as desired as a page is beingworked on.andP;  For example, a variety of boxes and rules can be stored in amaster page library for quick access during page makeup.andP;  These elements areaccessed from the same menu as master pages, which could make the list getquite long.andP;  LaserMaker is planning to make it easier to locate items from along list by allowing the operator to type the first several letters of thename, which will then place the cursor on the item.andM;User interface: mouse, menu, keyboardandM;One feature that distinguishes LaserMaker from most other programs is itsconvenient use of the two-button mouse and popup menus.andP;  At any time duringinteractive operations on a page, clicking the right-hand mouse button withthe cursor anywhere on the screen brings up the main menu with the item thatwas used most recently highlighted.andP;  There is no need to move the mousecursor prior to clicking.andP;  Additional clicks of the same button accessadditional levels of the menu structure.andP;  These don't cascade to the right inthe same way that, for example, Interleaf's menus do.andP;  They appear nearly ontop of the previous menu, requiring only vertical movement of the mouse tomake selections.andM;This implementation saves space on the screen and seems to work fine inpractice.andP;  Most important, it minimizes the amount of &quot;menu chasing&quot; theoperator has to do.andP;  For menu haters who admit reluctantly that there is aplace for menus, LaserMaker has a nearly optimal approach.andM;Menu items that are not available at any given time are italicized, ratherthan grayed, as on a Macintosh.andP;  The advantage of using full-intensityitalics is that it is a little easier to read than some of the grayed text ona Macintosh.andM;While the right-hand button selects the next operation, the left-hand buttonmoves back one level in the hierarchy.andM;Going hand in hand with the way menus pop up and minimize sliding the mousearound its pad, LaserMaker makes excellent use of defaults and rememberingpreviously used commands.andP;  As we noted earlier, the main menu always pops tothe item used most recently.andP;  So does each additional level in the menuhierarchy, which means that performing a similar operation twice in a row canbe done without mouse movement.andP;  This remembering facility applies to allfunctions on the menus concurrently, so that even after you switch to to adifferent main menu item, when you return to an earlier one, the systemremembers which lower levels were used most recently and defaults to them.andM;Another nice feature is that the system doesn't insist on displaying allitems that are selected, if there is a reason not to.andP;  For example, if anoperator clicks the mouse very rapidly through menus without waiting to seethe menus, the system saves time by not displaying the intermediate menus; itgoes right to the final one that was clicked.andM;Similarly, as we will discuss later, if the operator calls for the display ofpage elements and then changes his or her mind and issues a new command, thesystem automatically aborts the earlier display and attends to the newcommand.andP;  This saves a great deal of time (and frustration).andP;  We wish allvendors would optimize performance by doing the same thing.andM;LaserMaker provides a convenient facility for selecting any of five cursorresponse speeds.andM;The Keyboard.andP;  Anything that can be done with the mouse can be done also withthe keyboard, and in a similarly efficient way.andP;  When in layout mode,mnemonic commands work very quickly to bring results.andP;  For example, &quot;J N&quot;jumps to the next page.andP;  &quot;T L&quot; grabs the excess text in the current frame andloads it in a buffer, from which &quot;T F&quot; flows that text into another frame.andO;These commands actually bring up the same menus that can be accessed with themouse if the operator needs prompting, but if the commands are typed quickly,the menus are bypassed.andM;This sytem works so well both from the keyboard and from the mouse that wehave found it hard to develop a preference.andP;  (This is in contrast toBestinfo's current Wave4 program, which tends to be clumsy in both mouse andkeyboard use.)andM;Working with framesandM;LaserMaker uses the frame or container as the key structural element in pagedesign.andP;  Everything is created in a frame that is placed on a page.andP;  Textflows into frames.andP;  Graphics are imported into frames.andP;  Boxes are enclosed inframes.andM;Frames are created by bringing in a standard frame from a library andstretching or shrinking it to the desired size.andP;  The procedure for doing thisis very much like the standard Macintosh convention, although it isn'tidentical.andM;At any time, a frame can be given a name of up to 35 characters in length sothat it can be accessed again.andM;Handles.andP;  A frame has handles at each corner and midway between corners.andP;  Across cursor (which is much coarser than a typical crosshair cursor) is usedto select a handle, after which the frame can be moved or scaledanamorphically or proportionally.andP;  (There is no pointing finger to try tolocate for stretching a frame.)andM;Depending on how the frame is to be adjusted, different handles are selected.andO;A neat keyboard shortcut enables jumping directly to any one of the handlesby striking the appropriate number from the numeric keypad (one number foreach of the eight handles individually), or selecting them all by striking&quot;5,&quot; which enables moving the frame wthout resizing it.andP;  This system is muchfaster than grabbing the mouse, moving the cursor close enough to a handle towake up a pointing finger and clicking the mouse.andM;A frame can be deleted in Macintosh fashion by selecting it (left mousebutton) and striking the DELETE key.andM;Each frame has an origin and dimensions, both of which can be edited to placethe frame exactly in a certain location.andP;  These values can be changed byselecting either the origin data or the dimension data, which unfortunatelyare separate items that can't be done with one command.andP;  (LaserMaker keepsthem separate so that they can be locked independently.)andM;Selecting these items deposits the cursor on the command line of the screen,where existing values are displayed.andP;  The user edits these as desired.andP;  Thisis one area in which the user interface varies significantly from Macintoshconventions; it doesn't use a dialog box to plot the coordinates.andP;  For noviceusers, we think the dialog box is easier, but for traditional typographicmarkets, the LaserMaker method may be faster and probably does the job justas well.andM;Text frames.andP;  One of the properties of a frame is its &quot;source,&quot; which is howtext is assigned to a frame.andP;  The user selects &quot;source&quot; from the editmenu,whcih brings up the standard LaserMaker directory from which a file canbe selected.andP;  The text then flows into the frame, taking its width from theshape of the frame and the rest of its parameters from commands in the file.andM;If the text exceeds the size of the file, the excess is designated as&quot;overmatter&quot; and awaits a decision by the user as to what to do.andP;  The usercan load the overmatter into a buffer and flow it into another container,which requires an additional step, or the overmatter can be left hanginguntil a place can be found for it.andP;  This operation consumes some manualattention although, as we noted above, the keyboard shortcuts for loading theovermatter into a buffer and dumping it into a new container make thisoperation quite easy to perform.andM;Editing text in frames.andP;  Frames display text in semi-WYSIWYG mode, using thesame four fonts as the soft-copy preview mentioned earlier.andP;  This text isn'teditable.andP;  However, selecting &quot;edit&quot; from the main menu brings up an optionto edit text, which, in turn, brings up the text file in the same text windowthat is used for regular editing.andP;  For minor changes, this procedure iscumbersome, but for a significant amount of editing, it is ideal.andP;  Theimplementation of editing is much better than what Bestinfo allows in Wave4(although Bestinfo has an improved facility set for its OS/2 version).andM;As text is edited in this fashion, it uses the frame boundaries from the pagelayout to set its line length and to report its depth.andP;  Editors writing tofit can get the necessary feedback from the screen.andP;  The story header showsthe current depth of the column (frame).andP;  With multicolumn text, as onecolumn is filled and a new one is started, the depth counter is reset tozero.andP;  There is no indication in the file where column breaks occur.andO;However, if the amount of text in the file exceeds the space in the allocatedframes, all overmatter appears underlined in the file.andM;All aspects of the program use the same handamp;j process.andM;Commands can be edited independently of text, also by selecting an item fromthe &quot;edit&quot; menu.andM;Overlapping frames.andP;  LsaerMaker supports parent/child frame relationships inwhich one frame can be located inside another one, which causes anything doneto the parent to be done to the child also.andP;  For example, if the parent ismoved or stretched, so is the child.andP;  The child must be located completelywithin the parent.andM;Children can have children, and so on, each having to fit within the nextitem up in the hierarchy.andM;It is possible also to have a frame overlap one or more other frames withouta parent/child relationship.andP;  In this situation, the operator can specifywhere frames repel text and where they allow text to flow inside theoverlapping frame.andM;Jumping.andP;  An interesting feature that fits more in the user interface areathan in system functionality is the ability to &quot;jump in&quot; and &quot;jump out of&quot;frames to change the focus of the work area.andP;  For example, if a template ofeight or more pages is displayed, each page in small size, jumping into onepage brings that page to fill the screen so it can be worked on more easily.andO;Similarly, jumping into a frame on a page brings it into prominence.andO;Alternatively, jumping out of a frame or page does the reverse.andM;Jumping can be used to access any frame by name.andM;Innovative grid systemandM;In addition to the ability to place elements exactly by editing theircoordinate positions ad dimensions, LaserMaker provides alignment featuresbased on horizontal and vertical grids.andM;The grid facility is another of LaserMaker's innovative provisions not foundon other systems.andP;  Unlike most systems, which ask for the grid spacing andgenerate an entire page according to the specified increment, LaserMakerallows the operator to &quot;design&quot; the grid.andP;  Different parts of the grid can bespaced differently, with text snapping to whatever grid is under it.andP;  Thisfeature enables not only placing elements easily and accurately on the grid,but the grid itself defines columns, making it easy to flow text onto a pagedefined by the grid.andM;The ability to design the grid is useful when a standard page consists ofdifferent elements, such as the pages of this Report, where we use a leadingvalue of 11 points for our body text and 9.5 points for our captions, whichappear at the top of the page.andP;  Our grid for these pages shows 9.5-pointleading at the top and 11-point leading below.andP;  Similarly, running headersand footers can snap to the grid at still different intervals.andM;The command to generate a sample horizontal grid might be as follows: 3 21*50 2 3 where 3 picas is the space between the top and bottom of the pageand the first grid line, 2 picas is the space between the first line and thenext one, and there are 50 lines for body text, each 1-pica apart.andM;With horizontal grids, the user chooses whether to snap or not a any giventime.andP;  Snapping is a property of a frame that can be changed at any time.andO;Because frams know whether they belong in a gutter or in a column, it is easyto snap an element such as a gutter rule in place correctly the first time.andM;Like horizontal grids, vertical grids can be customized.andP;  Vertical grid linescan be spaced in accord with margins, columns and gutters to enable frames tosnap to the appropriate location on the page.andM;A sample vertical grid might look a little more complicated than a horizontalgrid: 3 (8,1)*5 3 0 3 (8*1) where 3 picas represents the inside and outsidemargins and there are 5 columns of 8-pica widths separated by -pica gutterson each page.andP;  The 0 is more of a place holder than a useful value.andM;In addition to these entries, a &quot;D&quot; can be added in front of either ahorizontal or a vertical grid command to cause only such a flagged item to bedisplayed in certain situations.andP;  In other words, if there is a need todisplay part of the grid in certain situations, the operator can enable thatby designating which grid lines are to be displayed.andM;LaserMaker doesn't support any other means of aligning frames, such ascentering one with respect to another, as might be useful in freeform layoutof a brochure or an ad.andM;One alignment concern we should mention is that the first line of textordinarily appears just on top of its frame, rather than just inside it.andP;  Theexplanation for this anomaly is that the first text baseline is aligned tocoincide with the top of the frame.andP;  The work-around is to start each textfile with extra leading.andP;  Fortunately, this isn't a problem when a text fileis continued in another frame.andP;  In this case, the text starts at the correctlocation.andM;Grids are a property of a frame, so it is possible to create a framespecifying a grid that will be needed later, save it and reuse it whenever itis needed.andM;Our experiences with pagesandM;We produced these pages using the LaserMaker system.andP;  In general, we found itto be easily up to the task, although, as we have noted, there are a fewthings we would like to see changed.andP;  These pages should stand as an exampleof how well the system works.andM;Page display.andP;  The basic display -- the one that appears when layout mode isentered -- includes the entire template that is part of the currentpublication.andP;  It could be any number of pages, although they all aredisplayed on the same screen, so a very large number would make them allquite small.andP;  The user specifies the arrangement on the screen: four pages ineach of two rows, 16 pages in eight rows, etc.andM;There are five different ways that a template (or individual pages) can bedisplayed, each of which is programmable to display different elements.andP;  Ingeneral, though, these five options should be set up so that some viewsdisplay only frame boundaries, others include text and/or grid lines, and soon.andP;  The following is one way to set up the views:andM;* Flat plan -- no text, but showing frame boundaries, rules, boxes.andM;* Output -- only those elements that will appear on output, thus hiding gridsand any other items, including text, that have been specified as not to beoutput.andM;* Page -- all elements on a page, including text, grids and graphics.andM;* With text -- showing all text, including headers/footers and body text.andM;* Custom -- as determined by the user.andM;All of the pages on a template are active in that they can be worked on,frames can be moved, stretched, etc.andP;  But it obviously isn't practical towork on pages that are tiny on the screen.andM;As a result, it is generally easiest to work on a page at a time, displayedso it will fit on the screen in its entirety, at actual size or zoomed up toany desired percentage.andM;To bring up a single page from the template view, the operator &quot;jumps in,&quot;which quickly brings the page in to fill the screen area.andM;Moving between pages.andP;  The jump facility is used also to move to the next orprevious page, to the next or previous linked frame, and so on -- a nicemeans of getting quickly to a variety of new locations.andP;  To go to a page thatisn't next or previous and isn't known by name, the operator can &quot;jump out&quot;to return to the template screen, move the cursor to another page, and &quot;jumpin&quot; to that page.andP;  That sounds like a lot of steps, but it happens quicklyand it can be done with the keyboard or mouse.andP;  The default template viewdoesn't show text, so it brings up the pages quickly.andP;  It takes a lot longerto display a full template with text.andM;The screen provides good feedback regarding the page status.andM;Working with text pages.andP;  We discussed working with text frames earlier.andO;Here we will elaborate on the intricacies of working with multiple pages andmultiple articles.andM;Flowing text into frames is a straightforward proposition.andP;  The text fillsthe measure of the frame, snapping to the grid if the snap feature is on --and if the leading specified in the story is the same as the grid spacing.andO;If the leading is different from the grid spacing, the first line of the jobwill align to the grid and the rest will conform to the leading command,rather than to the grid.andM;If a small frame is placed inside a larger one, the text can be asked toshape itself around the small frame, or it can run through the small frame.andO;If the text runs around the second frame, the system allows specification ofthe size of the gutter between the two.andM;Overmatter.andP;  If the text is longer than the frame, a blob is displayed toindicate that there is overmatter.andP;  The amount of overmatter is shown in theheader.andM;If the overmatter is to be continued on a later page, the user can load itinto a buffer and flow it into another frame, as we mentioned earlier.andP;  Thesystem doesn't automatically generate continuation messages when a storyjumps from one page to another, so if these messages are required, they haveto be inserted manually.andP;  To avoid having to embed these messages in the textstream, the user can put them in a frame that is fixed to the page, but thisis still an inconvenient process.andM;We have found flowing text into multiple columns to work satisfactorilyduring initial input, but it is more cumbersome if the text is to be removedfrom a series of frames.andP;  To remove such a file, the operator has to gomanually through each of the frames and change the frame's source to &quot;no fileat all&quot; -- which actually isn't a cumbersome operation because of the way themouse and menus default to their most recent operation.andP;  But it would be niceto be able to remove an entire story with one command, as Bestinfo does,partly to simplify things for the operator and partly for the system.andM;As is our custom with these product reviews, we tried hard to give the systemindigestion.andP;  We had no problems with the text editor, the tag system, outputand most other areas.andP;  But when it came to flowing text in a variety of ways,removing it and flowing it again, we succeeded in confusing the computer.andM;Although we view the software as basically quite stable, two strange thingshappened while we were writing and producing this article using Leaps.andP;  Oncewe lost a file forever when we removed it from a frame inside another frame.andO;It is possible that we were doing something that isn't supposed to be done,however, so we don't want this to be construed as a known bug.andP;  It was a rarecase of the system doing something strange, so we thought it should bementioned.andM;The other item that we should note happened several times when we tried toflow again a story that already had been flowed partly into a frame.andP;  Thesystem allows the story to be reflowed, leaving two copies on pages.andP;  Wedon't think the system should work that way -- and in a system such asBestinfo's Wave4, that wouldn't happen.andP;  When a story is called again, thesystem should pick up where it left off flowing it the last time.andM;For the most part, though, the program is stable and unlikely to causenightmares for its operators.andM;We especially like the way repainting the screen has been implemented.andP;  If alot of repainting has just begun and the user realizes he doesn't need to seethe rest, he can go on to another operation and the repainting will haltinstantly to follow the new operation.andP;  We wish all system developers wouldadopt this same practice.andP;  The amount of time that can be lost waiting for auseless screen repainting job is great.andM;For our pages, we created master pages with two frames and a gutter inbetween them.andP;  But it also would be possible to produce these pages as asingle frame divided into two collumns with a gutter automatically added.andM;Writing to fit and multiuser issuesandM;Although many of LaserMaker's current customers have single-user systems, aproduct of this type is most productive if multiple stations are available tosupport multiple users performing different tasks.andP;  For instance, one personcan work on production and another can perform editing and writing to fit thespace allocated.andM;Stories can be made to fit their spaces by taking either of two approaches.andO;They can be written first and flowed into frames suited to their length.andP;  Orframes can be created first and then stories written to fit the size.andP;  Ineither case, writing or editing is done in the editing mode, which can beaccessed from the text program or from the layout program.andM;If a story is being written or edited to fit a given space, the systemprovides good feedback regarding how the length of the story compares withthe space allocated for it.andP;  This is true whether the story is being editedin the editing window associated with the layout program or if it is enteredfrom the text side.andM;Feedback comes in two forms: in the header and in the text area.andP;  While theuser types, the header reports the depth at the cursor position until itreaches the end of the frame, at which time it goes back to zero to startcounting the next frame.andP;  So if the operator wants to know which frame(column) he is in or to avoid a widow or orphan condition, he looks to seewhen the counter starts over.andP;  It would be nice if the system drew a lineacross the screen at every column break, as Bestinfo and Atex do, butwatching the counter isn't difficult.andM;If the story grows longer than the frame and there is no additional frame toflow into, the system displays overmatter by underlining it in the text area.andM;Making corrections.andP;  We noted earlier that a template is locked to otherusers when one person has it open on the screen.andP;  However, this doesn't meanthat no one can work on any of the stories assigned to that template.andP;  Inmuch the fashion that Bestinfo operates with Wave4 and Atex with PC PageMakeup, multiple users can access individual stories from a publication atthe same time.andM;With LaserMaker, while a production person is viewing or manipulating thelayout of one or more pages, another user can call for a story that appearson one of those pages.andP;  That story can be edited and stored back on diskwithout the production person knowing it.andP;  In fact, the production personwon't know anything about the editing activity until the system redisplaysthe page for another reason, at which time it will go to disk and call up thecurrent version, which will be different from the one that has been on thescreen, and display that one.andM;If the changes have resulted in a different length for the story, furtheradjustments may have to be made either in the layout or in the text.andM;During this kind of editing back and forth, the production and editorialpersonnel can see each others' notes in the command field, so it would bepossible for a production person to ask an editor to cut six lines from thestory or to add to it, or for an editor to request additional space for animportant story.andP;  These messages would travel across the network.andM;One problem that can't be so easily worked out is access by multiple layoutpersonnel to different pages within the same template.andP;  As the program nowworks, users are likely to keep the number of pages in their templatesrelatively small so the production operation doesn't bottleneck at the layouteditor's desk while no one else can be productive.andM;Illustrations and graphicsandM;All graphics and illustrative matter are handled as frames that are placedmanually on pages.andP;  There are no facilities for floating illustrationsautomatically.andP;  But it is possible to specify that space is to be reservedfor illustrations.andM;LaserMaker has been working on beefing up its graphics capabilities.andP;  It nowimports EPSF files, which can be placed on a page, scaled to fill a frame andcropped.andP;  TIFF graphics can be converted to LaserMaker format and imported.andM;Within the program, a variety of boxes and rules can be created, but thereare no facilities for drawing items such as more complex polygons or circles.andM;OutputandM;The LaserMaker system drives conventional typesetters (Linotype Coramachines, Chelgraph Ace, Monotype Laser-comp and Prism, compugraphic 8600 and9000 series, Autologic APS-5 and Micro5 and Varityper-4300) and PostScriptdevices.andP;  It supports PostScript proofing with font substitution to match asclosely as possible the fonts on the typesetter.andM;The setup procedure (for specifying the number of copies, page orientation,whether or not to print the galley slug, etc.) uses the same function-keyapproach as the rest of the program.andP;  The galley slug shows the date and timeprinted, the catch and queue, issue and description.andM;Unfortunately, there is no way to send individual pages with one command.andO;All pages in the template have to be sent together.andM;When driving a PostScript printer, the PC sends data at a rate of about 300characters per second -- a statistic that comes from a message on top of thescreen.andP;  When driving a typesetter, no message is present.andM;Since our last system review, LaserMaker has improved the ease of use of itsutilities for handling kerning, tracking and other output functions.andM;LaserMaker supplies direct and spooling alternatives of its output drivers.andO;Each user, on a function-by-function basis if necessary, can have eitherdirect or spooled output.andP;  Where spooling is used, files sent for output goto a server PC, which normally is dedicated to spooling (unless a '386monitor program is used).andP;  Files normally are output in the same order theyarrive in the queue.andP;  There are no formal facilities for managing the queueor changing the order of items, except by deleting ones that have beendetermined to be lower in priority than ones farther down the queue.andM;LaserMaker syas it is looking at third-party software for improving itsqueuing facilities.andM;The growing user baseandM;LaserMaker is quietly accumulating an impressive customer base, primarily inthe UK, but also in other countries.andP;  The entire list, which spans 20countries, includes a lot of single-user configurations.andP;  We'll concentratehere on the networks and other large orders, including the Home Newsnewspaper site, which will follow this rundown.andM;Morgan-Grampian plc.andP;  The king of the hill is Morgan-Grampian, the Britishmagazine producer that put LaserMaker on the map as a supplier of editorialsystems late in 1987.andP;  It started with a small, trial system for a fewpublications and now is producing 20 journals with a LaserMaker editorialsystem encompassing 200 workstations spread over 15 Novell networks.andO;Publications include three A4-sized weeklies, two tabloid-sized weeklies and15 A4 monthlies.andP;  More than half of these are producing full pages on thesystem; the rest are scheduled to do likewise by he end of July.andM;The system currently is used by 100 journalists and 15 designers, but planscall for totals of 180 journalists and 20 designers to produce 35 journals.andO;Currently reportes are given standard PCs, subeditors get '286 machines withsmall screens and page make-up personnel use '386 units with large (A3)monitors.andM;Made-up pages are transmitted to about 15 different typesetting shops foroutput on a variety of typesetters.andP;  Morgan-Grampian wrote some of itw ownsoftware so that each of its LaserMaker systems automatically dials the rightphone number and prepares the file in the right typesetter language for theparticular job being done.andM;Morgan-Grampian likes the LaserMaker text editing program and uses thespelling checker and soft-copy preview extensively.andP;  Its authors write copyto fit allocated space.andM;Page make-up is handled by designers or editors.andP;  They say that the time tomake up pages on the system is approximately the same as it was with previousmanual methods, but that the new system provides other benefits, notablygreater ease in making changes.andP;  In addition, fitting copy to the layoutworks better because designers can identify over- and undermatter immediatelyand resolve it with an editor at the time.andP;  Another benefit is that lesschecking of typeset output is required because everything except graphicswill have been checked before the file is sent to the typesetter.andM;Benefits to the operation as a whole, according to Managing Director DavidBaker, are that the system has enabled Morgan-Grampian to adopt laterdeadlines for its publications and that cost savings have been realized -- inpart, of course, because of the elimination of duplicate keyboarding.andM;In response to the question of why Morgan-Grampian doesn't do its owntypestting, Baker said it is maintaining a firm differentiation between thepublishing and printing responsibilities and that, &quot;although the boundariesare moving, they haven't been removed.&quot;andP;  As the technology advances,  morewill be done inhouse, he said, but at the moment, handling classified anddisplay advertising, pirctures and artwork are done by outside specialists.andM;La Gazetta di Ancona.andP;  The customer with the largest number of workstationsis La Gazetta di Ancona, of Ferrara, Italy, which has 250 PCs runningLaserMaker software on six Novell networks.andM;Punch Publications.andP;  A system installed a year ago by Punch Publications, ofLondon, is producing five journals.andP;  It includes 70 stations on three NovellLANs.andM;Trader Group.andP;  An interesting application is in operation at Trader GroupNewspapers in Derby, UK, which purchased 75 LaserMaker packages.andP;  At the hubis a local area network with eight subeditors.andP;  The rest of the units areoperated remotely by users who send their data in over phone lines.andM;Maxwell Business Communications.andP;  MBC of London purchased 30 Leaps packageswith hardware, with a total value of about 135,000 pounds ($220,000), forproducing its magazines.andP;  All are running as standalone systems.andM;Jerusalem Report.andP;  The newest order came from the Jerusalem Report, whichwill install about 40 stations running on a Novell network.andP;  The order,including hardware, software, installation and training, was valued at about200,000 pounds ($325,000).andM;Haymarket Publications.andP;  Haymarket, the London-based publisher of more than30 magazines, has purchased a 14-station LM-Type and LM-Page system runningon a Novell network.andP;  Valued at approximately 70,000 pounds ($115,000), it isa pilot scheme that could result in further orders.andM;Rizzoli Corriera della Sera.andP;  Rizzoli Corriera of Italy has installed 20 IBMPS/2s with LM-Type software which so far are running as standalone units.andO;The total value is 100,000 pounds ($163,000)andM;Computertype.andP;  The London typesetting house Computertype has purchased fourLM-Page systems with hardware, valued at 30,000 pounds ($49,000).andM;AM International (France).andP;  AM, which is the distributor both for LaserMakerand for Virityper products, has ordered 16 LM-Type workstations for generaldistribution.andP;  The value is about +20,000 ($32,500).andP;  LaserMaker says that AMhas installed more than 100 LaserMaker systems in France to date.andM;Thomas Telford Ltd.andP;  Based in London, Thomas Telford is using 85 LaserMakerworkstations running on two Novell LANs that are connected via a bridge.andM;Benn Publications plc.andP;  Benn Publications, of Tonbridge, Kent, UK, hasinstalled a 100-PC system on six networks to produce 14 magazines, includingthe UK's Printing World weekly.andM;Type Matters Ltd.andP;  Type Matters, of London, has installed 100 LaserMakersystems, all operating in single-user mode.andM;Newspaper site in New JerseyandM;The Central New Jersey Home News, published in New Brunswick with acirculation of 65,000 daily and Sunday, is typical of many mid-range papersin the U.S.andP;  It has been using a 100-terminal DEC TMS-11 system for editorial(80 terminals) and classified (20 terminals) applications.andP;  With DEC gettingout of the software support business many years ago, the Home News has beenforced to look elsewhere for whatever enahncements or replacements it mightget for its equipment.andM;It has assembled a varied assortment of products from multiple vendors tofill its needs.andP;  It uses Layout-8000 to create its ad stack.andP;  It has fiveCamex Breezes for display ads, interfaced to Autokon cameras for ad graphics.andO;It uses a Macintosh for some of its editorial graphics, outputting them on aVarityper VT600 and pasting them in as camera-ready art.andP;  Camex's CAPSclassified pagination system merges Breeze ads onto classified pages andoutputs them in one piece.andP;  A stauffer Gold library system is interfaced tothe TMS-11 for archival and retrieval of stories.andP;  The building is wired withEthernet, using 3Com's 3+Open.andM;The newest member to join this family is LaserMaker's Leaps system, which isnow being used to paginate a large portion of the paper.andP;  There are nine AST'386 PCs running LM-Page, with 24-inch Moniterm Viking monitors.andP;  Initially,this system produced the TV and weekend stock pages.andP;  Then some regular newsand feature pages were added.andP;  The target is to paginate the entire paper bythe end of 1991.andM;The TMS system is still used for reporter input and reception of wire servicestories.andP;  Reporters using the DEC system write their stories to fitpreallocated space, based on the handamp;j available on the TMS-11.andP;  Editors thentake over, also running handamp;j on the DEC system as they edit.andP;  None of theselength calculations is guaranteed to be correct, though, because final handamp;jwill be done with LaserMaker's algorithm.andP;  The Home News says the handamp;j resultsare very close, but not quite the same.andM;Stories are sent from the DEC system to the PC, where a data conversionprogram supplied by Blueberry Software converts the DEC code to LaserMakerformat, except for wire stories that haven't been edited on the DEC system.andO;These are already in ASCII format and don't have to be translated.andM;Copy flow hasn't been a problem.andP;  The Home News has set up its LaserMakerQueue structure to match closely the setup on the DEC system to simplifyoperations and keep copy flowing smoothly.andP;  There is a queue for copyeditors, one for rim editors, one for layout, one for typesetting, one forproofing and one for finished jobs.andP;  At the layout stage, proofs can bepulled from an Apple LaserWriter, either on a frame basis or an entire page.andO;Rim editors and layout personnel send stories back and forth as pages arelaid out.andM;The Home News makes good use of LaserMaker UDKs and prestored frames tohandle elements such as pulled quotes.andM;Last-minute changes can be brought over to the LaserMaker system and insertedin their appropriate places, or, more likely, they will be typed in aspatches.andM;When we visited the Home News in January, we were told that the staff hadreacted very positively to automation of the make-up task.andP;  In particular, acouple of people who were quite reluctant at first have now become quiteskilled operators.andM;When we asked what was on the Home News wish list for the LaserMaker system,we were told that there was nothing on the list.andP;  There are no majorobstacles.andP;  The hardest part is getting in the hardware and training itsstaff.andM;Over the long run, the Home News plans to have all copy editors useLaserMaker workstations with small screens and all page disigners useLaserMaker with large screens.andP;  The DEC system will continue to be used, butonly as a word processor for reporter input.andP;  All coding will be done withinLaserMaker.andM;FuturesandM;LaserMaker's next general release will include some developments already inoperation at Morgan-Grampian.andP;  The following few items are among them.andM;As an alternative to the present copyflow system, in which items sent to thetypesetter are difficult to retrieve, there will be a freer copyflow systemthat allows page and text files to move between queues independently andfunctions can be applied to files with few queue-related restrictions.andO;LaserMaker emphasizes that the new copy flow system will be flexible enoughto enables significant changes to suit other users' requirements also.andM;There will be speed improvements in handamp;j, layout (with a greeking option),output (by reducing the file size), filing operations and switching betweenthe text and the layout editing programs.andM;There will be a display of the amount of undermatter similar to the currentovermatter indicator.andM;Further work will be done on the interface between LM-Page/LM-Type andLM-Studio.andP;  Copy will flow between the two, text filters will be offered andthe fonts and character sets will be integrated.andM;A lot of effort will be put into handling images and other EPSF files, plusthe ability to read TIFF files directly, rather than having to convert themfirst.andP;  Speed of displaying images will be greatly increased.andM;For output, there will be device-specific functions aimed at the majorimagesetters on the market, plus a driver for the CLS 2090 Laserset.andM;Farther in the future, LaserMaker is planning some enhancements to itscomposition, including support for flowing text around irregular shapes, plusbetter vertical justification, no-break blocks, multilanguage hyphenation andspot color.andM;In graphics, the focus will be on more effective processing of high-volumegraphics.andM;Finally, the interface to Layout 8000 that is in use at the Home News will beavailable as a regular product.andM;ConclusionandM;We were pleasantly surpised by out experience with LM-Type and LM-Page intheir latest guise.andP;  Although we had found LaserMaker's system easy to usewhen we last reviewed it, the system at that time was much morestraightforward than the new product.andP;  To put out our pages successfully atthat time, the main task was writing some clever formats to get columns oftext in the right places.andM;As anyone who has used Bestinfo's Wave4 or even programs such as VenturaPublisher will attest, when WYSIWYG layout features are added, there is noway to avoid having the program become complex and, generally speaking,significantly harder for the programmers to debug and for the users to learn.andM;LM-Page comes pretty close to disproving the latter part of that theory.andP;  Ittook us about two days (and perhaps five phone calls to the U.S.andP;  supportoffice) to learn the program well enough to run it from start to finish --file management, setting up master pages and flowing text in and out of ourpage templates.andP;  We needed a little help in setting up the page grids, butmost of the program nearly runs itself because of the prompts and menus ituses.andM;The other part of the story, as we have noted repeatedly, is the satisfactiongained by not having to overexert ourselves moving the mouse all over thepad, both because it doesn't have to be moved very much in its own tasks andbecause the keyboard shortcuts are so effective.andM;The prospects.andP;  None of this means that LaserMaker will be the next goliathin the system business.andP;  The company -- or, at least, its people -- has beenaround nearly as long as anyone in the &quot;new wave&quot; system market.andP;  But ithasn't had much of an impact until now.andP;  Some false starts anddisappointments, notably the alliance with Varityper when the product wascalled Maxx, didn't help.andM;Has the moment finally arrived?andP;  Based on the experience in the UK, it mightbe fair to say yes.andP;  LaserMaker's impressive list of companies with largenetworked systems probably rivals the performance of Bestinfo in the U.S.,andO;where the market is much bigger and where it has been ripe for automation fora much longer period of time than the union-riddled UK.andM;But to make it in the U.S., it will take a mighty effort.andP;  As we noted at theoutset, not only are there Atex and Bestinfo to contend with, but there arePenta, Miles and half a dozen other companies with established presences.andO;For LaserMaker to be successful, it will need an alliance with a powerfulfirm.andP;  There are those who think IBM will step in and fill the gap.andP;  But ifIBM's record in the two years since it signed its first ideal with LaserMakerare any indication, we hope no one is banking on Big Blue.andM;We don't know of any other companies looking for an opportunity of this type,but we suspect that the best bet would be one that is in this businessalready and could focus quickly on getting to the market.andP;  We doubt thatCompugraphic, Linotype or Varityper would be interested because of theirprevious lack of success with PC-based products, but they are ideas.andP;  Wewonder how PPI is doing with its version of Atex's PC Page Makeup program.andM;Who will buy it?andP;  It's interesting that the first newspaper pagination saletook place in the U.S., not in England, where LaserMaker has had most of itssuccess.andP;  We don't think that means that the U.S.andP;  newspaper market is goingto be the key to the company's future.andP;  It's a good general-purposecomposition system that can handle many tasks.andP;  It should be successful inproducing magazines and in similar inhouse operations in which freeformlayout is the prime requirement.andP;  It won't be successful in work thatinvolves long documents with structured formats, at least until it handlesautomatic numbering, automatic creation of pages as text flows, and itemssuch as floating illustrations and footnotes.andM;But even without those features, there should be a lot of sales in otherareas, as the UK and Europe have already begun to demonstrate.andP;  Perhaps partof the reason is the company itself and its ebullient, tenacious managingdirector, Tom O'Connor, who has survived more battles than most of us willever see.andP;  His product seems to reflect his experience in the industry, akind of street wisdom mixed with an exuberance that suggests that the big oneis just around the corner.andP;  We hope so -- for Tom, his staff and the industrythat has been searching for several years for a productive, quality-oriented,easy-to-use composition system.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
