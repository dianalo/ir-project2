Baker III.   ``It did not take into account international law, nor did itweigh the president's constitutional responsibility to carry outthe foreign policy of the United States.''   In a brief exchange with reporters Baker added: ``This procedurewill not be used absent a full interagency discussion of all theforeign policy'' implications.   The White House issued a statement echoing Baker's remarks andsaying, ``There will be no arrests abroad that have not beenconsidered through that interagency process.''   Earlier, spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said the legal opinionby the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel did notnecessarily mean President Bush would authorize such arrests totake place.   ``It is important to isolate the above question of whetherdomestic legal authority might exist from the question of whetherthe president will, in fact, authorize the use of that authority,''Ms. Tutwiler said.   ``In any given case, the president must weigh his responsibilityfor managing both foreign affairs and law enforcement,'' saidTutwiler, who noted that Baker only ``learned of it this morning''in news accounts.   Bush, too, had not been informed of the Justice Department'sruling, said an administration source, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The president was caught off guard when asked about the rulingfollowing its disclosure in Friday editions of the Los AngelesTimes.   ``I'm embarrassed to say I don't know what it is. I'll have toget back to you with your question,'' the president told reporters.   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said that ``people atthe White House and other parts of the government have beeninformed through the process in drawing up this opinion.''   Asked why Bush and Baker did not know about the opinion, Runkelsaid: ``Their lawyers did.''   ``Our job is to provide legal advice and that's what we'vedone,'' he said.   The opinion changing a 9-year-old Justice Department policy onthe FBI's arrest powers overseas was issued June 21 by AssistantAttorney General William Barr.   The FBI said it had taken no action under the ruling, nor wouldany such arrests be made without an interagency review.   The bureau said it requested the opinion to clarify itsauthority to arrest a number of fugitives at large overseas who arebeing sought on such charges as hijacking, hostage taking and otherterrorist acts.   ``This advice, along with many other factors, will be consideredin the devlopment of any plan to apprehend fugitives abroad,'' theFBI said in a statement.   Asked if the opinion sanctioned kidnapping, Attorney GeneralDick Thornburgh said: ``We don't see it that way.''   On Capitol Hill, Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of theHouse Judiciary Committee's constitutional rights subcommittee,said he would hold hearings on the policy, which he said ``wouldmake us an international brigand, an international outlaw.''   Ms. Tutwiler's comments signaled that the State Department wouldseek to influence any presidential decision to allow the FBI tocircumvent a foreign country's extradition procedures to make suchan arrest.   One of the diplomatic concerns is that the arrest of a U.S.fugitive in foreign territory without the country's permissioncould provoke a reciprocal action.   The ruling could conceivably be used by the FBI to arrestPanamaniam strongman Gen. Manuel Noriega and bring him to trial inFlorida on drug trafficking charges.   Barr's finding reversed a policy dating back to the Carteradministration that specifically prohibited the FBI fromcircumventing extradition procedures in a foreign country.   The 1980 policy was issued in response to an FBI proposal tokidnap fugitive financier Robert L. Vesco from the Bahamas. Vesco,who is still at large, is accused of milking hundreds of millionsof dollars from mutual funds before fleeing the country in 1973.   Federal laws enacted by Congress in 1984 and 1986 gave U.S.authorities jurisdiction to prosecute acts of terrorism involvingAmerican citizens overseas, including airplane hijackings andkillings carried out to coerce a government.   But those laws did not confer on U.S. law enforcement agenciesthe power to make arrests in other countries without the permissionof foreign governments.   The FBI went to great lengths in 1987 to lure convicted hijackerFawaz Younis to a yacht in international waters off Cyprus toarrest him for leading a 1985 hijacking of a Jordanian airlinercarrying several U.S. citizens.   Younis, a Lebanese, was recently sentenced to 30 yearsimprisonment for the hijacking, which began in Beirut.</TEXT></DOC>
