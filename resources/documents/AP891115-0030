The Energy and Commerce subcommittee on transportation, tourismand hazardous materials approved the legislation Tuesday aftertestimony last week described a practice known as ``backhauling.''   Backhauling, intended to increase the revenues of shippers,means carrying a cargo on the return trip after making an originalshipment.   Recent hearings and news reports have documented how shippersbringing food from the Midwest to the East have carryied returnloads of garbage because eastern landfills are overflowing.   The bill would require the administration to determine whichcargoes may be backhauled and what procedure are needed to cleanthe vehicles when backhauling is permitted.   Subcommittee chairman Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, said the bill isintended to give flexibility to regulators.   ``This is not intended to be a veto or elimination of anybackhauling,'' he said. ``We don't want to foul up or createblockades within the food distribution system.''   Luken represents Cincinnati, where Kroger, a major supermarketchain, has its headquarters.   The bill is part of larger legislation dealing with hazardousshipments, including the safety of hazardous chemical shipments byrail. The spinoff bill was created because of publicity generatedby the hearing.   Today, the Public Works and Transportation surfacetransportation subcommittee is putting the final touches on relatedlegislation, and the full committee is scheduled to vote on itThursday.   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Bill Clinger, R-Pa., forbidsbackhauling of municipal solid waste in refrigerated food trucksand forbids mixed use of tank trucks or cars for hauling both foodand non-food items.</TEXT></DOC>
