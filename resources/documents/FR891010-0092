(CSXT), collectively referred to asapplicants, seek approval under 49 U.S.C. 11343, <T3>et seq.</T3>, for WTR to acquire, by purchase and lease, two connectedCSXT lines, totalling 224.19 miles, between: (1) Savannah and Rhine, GA;and (2) Vidalia and Macon, GA. Applicants contend that this is a minortransaction under 49 CFR 1180.2 and submitted their application in accordancewith the railroad consolidation regulations at 49 CFR 1180. WTR is a Class III railroad common carrier operating approximately 4 milesof line in Wilmington, NC. Its stock is owned by K. Earl Durden, WTR'spresident, and controlled by Southtrust Bank of Dothan, AL, under a votingtrust arrangement under the provisions of 49 CFR 1013.1 <T3>et seq.</T3> Durden also controls the Galveston Railroad, Inc., a ClassIII railroad operating in and around the Port of Galveston, TX. Applicantsstate that this transaction will have no effect on this carrier and thatDurden's control authority will not be expanded or affected. Durden's ownershipof WTR raises the question whether Durden should be required to participateas a party to this proceeding. We will use the term ``applicants'' to embraceWTR and CSXT only.\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Durden does not need, as a technical matter, to be formallystyled as an applicant, because we can obtain sufficient information fromthe above numerated applicants. <T3>See</T3> Finance Docket No. 32000, <T3>Rio Grande Industries, Inc., SPTC Holding Inc., and the Denver andRio Grande Western Railroad Company_Control_Southern Pacific TransportationCompany</T3>, Decision No. 3 (not printed), served January 22, 1988, inwhich under similar circumstances, the Anschutz Corporation was not requiredto be a co-applicant. <T3>See also</T3> Finance Docket No. 31522, <T3>Rio Grande Industries, Inc., et al._Purchase and Trackage Rights_Chicago,Missouri andamp; Western Railway Company Between St. Louis, MO and Chicago,IL</T3> (not printed), served August 18, 1989. CSXT, a subsidiary of CSX Corporation, is a Class I common carrier conductingoperations in 19 States, the District of Columbia, and Ontario, Canada.It transported about 33,800 originating and terminating carloads on thetwo lines at issue in 1987 and about 31,700 carloads in 1988. The linescarry some overhead traffic, which will be rerouted via alternate interchangepoints. The lines to be purchased total 165.45 route miles. They extend: (1) FromSavannah (milepost SL 499.13) to Rhine (milepost SL 629.25), in Chatham,Bryan, Evans, Tattnall, Toombs, Montgomery, Wheeler, Telfair and DodgeCounties, GA; and (2) from Vidalia (milepost SK 92.33) to East Dublin (milepostSK 58.00) in Toombs, Montgomery, Treutlen, and Laurens Counties, GA. Theassets to be purchased also include Track No. 1 (about .71 mile) at milepostSL 499.28 near Savannah, and Track No. SV 189 (about .47 mile) at milepostSH 512.62, also near Savannah. The line to be leased extends 57.92 route miles from Macon (milepost SK0.08) to East Dublin (milepost SK 58.00), in Bibb, Twiggs and Laurens Counties,GA. WTR will also lease the ``Old Yard'' at Savannah. CSXT will retaintrackage rights, which can be exercised under certain circumstances, overWTR between Savannah (milepost SL 499.13) and Vidalia (milepost SL 576.80)and between Vidalia (milepost SK 92.33) and East Dublin (milepost SK 58.00).CSXT will grant WTR trackage rights over its line at Savannah between milepostSL 449.13 and milepost 499.03, and between milepost SH 513.07 and milepostSH 511.35 (about 1.82 miles). Applicant states that the proposed transaction will permit WTR to expandinto new markets and secure a larger traffic and revenue base. CSXT willbe relieved of the inefficiencies inherent in operating what are for itmarginal lines. Both carriers will accordingly realize operating efficiencies.Since WTR's existing line will not connect with the lines involved in thisapplication, applicants argue that WTR's new opeation will have to dependon traffic generated by the lines to be acquired. Thus, WTR will have astrong incentive to provide service closely tailored to the needs of thelines' shippers. They expect that WTR's provision of good locally tailoredservice will enhance its financial viability by increasing its revenuebase. WTR anticipates effecting economies by sharing administrative, insuranceand operating costs with the new lines. It also anticipates that its provisionof effective competition and efficient service will enable it to diverttraffic from truck to rail on both lines. Applicants contend that the proposed transactions will not reduce competition,create a monopoly, or restrain trade in freight surface transportationin any region of the United States. As applicants do not compete for trafficon the line, the transaction will merely substitute one rail carrier foranother on an existing line. The line is parallel to an interstate highway,and the area is served by motor carriers. Applicants state that, if anything,the transaction should enhance intermodal competition by allowing the railmode to compete more effectively with other modes. The lines to be purchased connect with CSXT at Savannah, and WTR will beable to interchange at that point. Those lines also connect with the SouthernRailway Company (or its subsidiaries) at Helena, GA, and with the SouthCarolina Central Railroad Company, Inc. at Rhine, GA, and interchange canbe effected at both points. The line to be leased connects with SouthernRailway Company (or its subsidiaries) at Macon and Dublin, GA, and interchangecan be effected at either point. WTR now operates three locomotives and employs four people. After thistransaction is completed, it will operate 18 locomotives, own 195 railcars,and employ between 40 and 50 people. WTR will operate the lines to be purchasedand leased exclusively with its own additional employees working underrates of pay, rules and working conditions that it will establish. Accordingly,the proposed transaction will have no effect on WTR's existing employees.The transaction will result in the abolition of 53 CSXT positions. CSXTstates that it has not yet negotiated employee protection agreements withaffected employees pursuant to the conditions set forth in <T3>New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., </T3>360 I.C.C. 60(1979) and <T3>Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate, </T3>360 I.C.C. 653 (1980).However, it intends to do so prior to consummating the transaction.Under the consolidation regulations, we must determine whether a proposedtransaction is major, significant, minor, or exempt. The proposed transaction,involving Class I and Class III railroads, has no regional or nationalsignificance and will neither result in a major market extension nor reducethe present level of competition. Accordingly, we find the proposal isa minor transaction under andSection; 1180.2(c). Since the application complieswith our regulations governing minor transactions, we are accepting itfor consideration.The application and exhibits are available for inspection in the PublicDocket Room at the Offices of the Interstate Commerce Commission in Washington,DC. In addition, they may be obtained upon request from applicants' representativesnamed above.Any interested persons, including governmental entities, may participatein this proceeding by submitting written comments. Any person who filestimely written comments shall be considered a party of record if the commentsso request. In this event, no petition for leave to intervene need be filed.Consistent with 49 CFR 1180.4(d)(iii) written comments must contain:(a) The docket number and title of the proceeding;(b) The name, address, and telephone number of the commenting party andits representative upon whom service shall be made;(c) The commenting party's position, <T3>i.e., </T3>whether it supports or opposes the proposed transaction;(d) A statement of whether the commenting party intends to participateformally in the proceeding or merely comment on the proposal;If desired, a request for an oral hearing with reasons supporting the request;the request must indicate the disputed material facts that can only beresolved at a hearing; and(f) A list of all information sought to be discovered from applicant carriers.Because we have determined that the proposal constitutes a minor transaction,no responsive applications will be permitted. The time limits for processinga minor transaction are set forth at 49 U.S.C. 11345(d).Discovery may begin immediately. We admonish the parties to resolve alldiscovery matters expeditiously and amicably.This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the humanenvironment or energy conservation.<T3>It is ordered:</T3>1.
