The pact, reached tentatively two weeks ago after weeks ofintensive bargaining, comes after 17 months of oftenrancorous negotiations and averts the specter of a costlystrike at the airline, a unit of AMR Corp. of Fort Worth,Texas. Negotiations were conducted against a background ofheavy industrywide losses, and both labor and managementsignificantly lowered their sights on what they hoped toachieve in the pact.</LP><TEXT>   American, which is trying to hold down costs while itfinishes up a costly expansion, agreed to increase pilot payfar more than it had planned, especially to those paid on alower entry-level wage tier. The contract costs an estimated$1.2 billion over four years. But the pilots fell short oftheir goal to surpass pilots at Delta Air Lines Inc. as theindustry's best-paid group.   The contract does include a novel plan that ties thepilots' pay to corporate profits, and could make theairline's 8,800 pilots the highest paid in the industry ifAmerican reaches the record profit levels of 1988.   The board of the Allied Pilots Association, as the unionis called, had unanimously rejected American's previous offerin late January, principally because of problems with pay andmedical benefits proposals. Federal mediators overseeing thebargaining kept the two sides talking until they reachedagreement Feb. 9.   The two sides are leaving to an arbitrator some of thethorniest issues, notably what share of their medicalbenefits that pilots should pick up and some work-rulechanges.   The contract, which goes into effect immediately, isretroactive to Jan. 1, 1990, when the previous contractexpired.</TEXT></DOC>
