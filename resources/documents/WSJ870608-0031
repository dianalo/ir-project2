Shrinking feed costs, and last fall's sharp jump in profit in some sectors of the cattle business, are prompting a rebuilding of herds, analysts say. That follows prolonged contraction of the U.S. cattle industry, as falling beef demand and soaring costs drove many producers out of business.    As a result of the expansion, consumer beef prices are expected to rise significantly this year as cattlemen withhold animals from slaughter for use in breeding instead. For much of the year bull markets in livestock futures have foreshadowed the retail-price gains. Participation in cattle, hog and pork-belly futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has zoomed amid shrinking supplies and persistent shortages in slaughterings, particularly of hogs.    The retail price increases may be particularly sharp this summer, as peak demand and a temporary shortage of pork reduce total meat supplies. Tight beef supplies are likely to persist through next year as cattle raisers continue to breed and fatten young animals that would have been slaughtered in past liquidation, says Patrick Luby, a vice president of Oscar Mayer Foods Corp., a unit of General Foods Corp.    The consumer price index for May, set for release June 23, is likely to reflect a sharp jump in meat prices from April, economists say. The sharp rise may continue through June and July, says Donald Ratajczak, head forecaster at Georgia State University.    Food already is outpacing gains in the overall CPI this year: Food and beverage prices rose 4.6% during the four months ended in April, compared with a 2.6% increase in the CPI as a whole.    In fact consumers have begun to see the tightness in supplies translate into higher prices at meat counters. Since October beef prices have risen 3% on average, and prime cuts, the scarcest type of meat, have risen more sharply.    &quot;The price of top sirloin has increased 7% from last year,&quot; says Raymond Daniel, an economist with Wharton Econometrics Forecasting Associates Inc. in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. The full-year jump should hit 9% to 10%, Mr. Daniel says.    The National Cattlemen's Association found the average price of five prime cuts of beef in May was up 12%, or 29 cents a pound, compared with April prices. The association's 19-city survey includes New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Atlanta and Denver.    Beef lovers' only respite from rising prices would come from the increase in chicken and pork supplies expected later this year. Competition from those meats should hold down demand for beef, moderating the price gains, economists say.    However, little relief is seen until fall because pork supplies have come up surprisingly short this year, and ham and bacon prices have jumped.    Based on government hog inventories released in December and March, analysts and traders had expected major herd expansion and had figured that by now the slaughter would match last year's rate or run just slightly behind it.The March report showed a 3% increase from year-earlier levels in the hog population in 10 major pork-producing states, with a 6% increase in breeding animals and a 2% gain in those available for slaughter.    In April, though, slaughter fell 9% from a year earlier, according to the Agriculture Department, and Charles Levitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., estimates that in May slaughter was still running 7% behind a year earlier.    Although the government hog reports have been notoriously unreliable, the lighter-than-expected slaughter caught meat traders, packers and merchants off guard, particularly in the case of pork bellies.    &quot;Somewhere there are some piggies that are on paper, or someplace, that cost the industry a lot of money&quot; because they haven't come to slaughter, Mr. Daniel says.    And the government hog reports &quot;have been wrong so long, by such a large amount,&quot; says Gerald Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis, &quot;that it doesn't seem possible.&quot;    &quot;It's sure tough flying blind,&quot; Mr. Abbenhaus says.    Futures prices for hogs have surged about 26% since the government's March report, while futures for pork bellies -- or frozen slabs of uncured bacon -- have risen about 14%.    Meanwhile, the unexpectedly high wholesale prices for pork already have been passed on to consumers. Ham prices have jumped 19%, and bacon prices are up 22% from a year earlier, Mr. Daniel of Wharton Econometrics says. Demand for bacon peaks during the summer.    The price surges may abate; the pork industry is still banking on a major increase in pork supplies by summer's end. &quot;I'd be shocked if that doesn't happen,&quot; Georgia State's Mr. Ratajczak says.    However, pork prices may rise still more before leveling off sometime next month, he says.    Analysts are mostly at a loss to explain the shortfall in hog slaughterings. However, a possible reason for the unexpectedly small slaughterings, Mr. Ratajczak suggests, is that farm credit isn't as tight as it was in the spring of 1986. That means farmers aren't under as much pressure as they were last year to raise cash by selling hogs. </TEXT></DOC>
