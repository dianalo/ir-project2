An amendment to last year's Financial Institutions Reform,Recovery and Enforcement Act requires federal agencies tohelp blacks, Hispanics and Asians increase their presence inthe restructured Sandamp;L industry.   John Harshaw, president of the American League ofFinancial Institutions, a Washington-based organization ofminority-owned Sandamp;Ls, says that new bidding rules for thegovernment's Sandamp;L fire sale will keep failed minority-ownedthrifts in minority hands. Although minority investorshaven't succeeded in buying any of the 57 non-minoritythrifts the government has sold, Mr. Harshaw expectsminorities will ultimately pick up 10 of the approximately354 Sandamp;Ls in U.S. hands.   The bailout also creates opportunities for minorities inlegal, accounting and other services. The Resolution TrustCorp., created to sort out the thrift mess, recently set a 3%price advantage for minorities and women bidding fornon-legal professional work.   Resolution Trust expects to spend up to $500 million onoutside legal services in 1990. In 1989, less than $2 millionof the $99 million spent on outside legal fees went tominority or women-owned firms. But a Federal DepositInsurance Corp. official insists a new reporting system willsoon show an increase in fees paid to minority lawyers.                                                                                                          Another Magazine Aims   For Asian-Americans                                                                                                          THE OWNERS of A.D. magazine, set to premiere next month,want the publication to be a vehicle for a new Asian-Americanconsciousness.   It won't be easy. There are unique obstacles to thesuccess of A.D. -- which stands for Asian Descent. The Asianpopulation in the U.S. grew 70% to about 6.5 million between1980 and 1988, according to a Census Bureau report. Yet mostof the growth came from immigrants, who prefer Asian-languagemedia, says New York advertising consultant Joseph Lam.   Moreover, there's a traditional reluctance amongAsian-Americans to openly address issues of racial andcultural identity, which A.D. will emphasize. Audrey Chin, afinancial analyst working on A.D.'s business plan, concedesAsians are &quot;very quiet&quot; about such issues, includingdiscrimination. Still, she believes A.D. will provide &quot;astrong voice.&quot;   A.D. will target urban East Coast Asian-Americans. Twosimilar magazines, Jade and Rice, have failed in the pastthree years, and a third, Transpacific, has &quot;just begun toscrape the black&quot; after four years, says Publisher Tom Kagy.To make it, A.D. will have to convince skeptical advertisersthat there are many upscale young Asian-Americans who feelthe way editor Jeff Yang does: &quot;Each of us once tried to bethe same, to fit in,&quot; he says. &quot;But eventually we realizedthat you can't escape the role of color in this country.&quot;                                                                                                          Seed Clouds Spread   Over Engineering Pool                                                                                                          CORPORATE CASH is starting to flow to the nation'sfastest-growing pool of engineering talent -- black andHispanic students.   General Electric Co. has committed $35 million over 10years for minority students and faculty. And General MotorsCorp. has almost doubled its support for minority engineeringstudents since 1984 to $1.9 million last year. &quot;We're tryingto make sure we have enough engineering talent,&quot; says RichardO'Brien, a GM personnel official.   Meanwhile, the National Action Council for Minorities inEngineering, which distributes corporate funds to schools andminority engineering students, says it's running $500,000ahead of last year's $5 million budget.   In 1989, blacks received only 2,122, or 3%, of the 68,291engineering degrees awarded, about the same share as Hispanicstudents. On the bright side, U.S. engineering schoolenrollments turned up last year after a seven-year slide,with black and Hispanic students accounting for more thanhalf the increase.   Of course, some professionals believe corporations haven'tdone enough. &quot;Imagine at one point there was no moneyrunning,&quot; says Tyrone Taborn, who publishes three magazinesfor black and Hispanic engineers. &quot;Now there is a trickle.&quot;                                                                                                          A Departure From Norm   In Airport Business   AT THE NATION'S airports, minority entrepreneurs arequietly making business connections.   In 1980, the Transportation Department began requiringthat more airport concessions be owned by minorities andwomen because a study had found that neither of these groupsowned businesses at the top 21 airports. &quot;It was almost aclosed industry, serviced by a handful of vendors,&quot; saysClark Sharp, a Federal Aviation Administration civil rightsofficer.   Now, airport authorities must build minority participationinto the bidding process for any new or amended concessionlease.   Marriott Corp.'s Host/Travel Plaza's division, a majorconcessionaire, has had to give up some ground. So Host hasbeen expanding the role of minority partners. &quot;We've tried towork out ways to give minorities meaningful participationopportunities,&quot; says a Host spokesman. &quot;It's one of the factsof business life today.&quot;   The rule helped Patrick Jones, a black Chicago venturecapitalist, snap up three car rental outlets, at airports inPittsburgh, Orlando, Fla., and Charlotte, N.C. One of the sixrental concessions at each of the airports was reserved forminorities or women. &quot;It's a sleeper,&quot; Mr. Jones says of thelittle-publicized policy.</TEXT></DOC>
