(TRS) faced a dilemma inthe early 1980s.andP;  The good news: more than 30 million American Express cardholders around the world were following the company's advice not to leavehome without the ubiquitous plastic.andP;  The bad news: a blizzard of charge cardreceipts was descending on TRS domestic processing centers at a volumeapproaching 3 million pieces of paper each day.andM;Processing costs were getting out of hand.andP;  The high volumes also led to evergreater error rates, along with increasing delays in both monthly billing andin retrieval of receipts requested by card holders.andM;TRS realized it had to replace paper with electronic images, but nocommercially available system was big enough to perform the job.andP;  So, in1982, TRS turned to Teknekron Financial Systems for help.andP;  Teknekron waseventually merged into TRW Financial Systems Inc., a leading systemsintegrator.andP;  Additionally, TRW is a vendor of image technology.andM;The initial phase of TRS' project went on line as a fully operational systemin July 1988.andP;  Project costs are estimated at $80 million, and TRS is stilladding enhancements to the system.andM;And TRS now claims to run the world's largest transaction-processing systembased on image processing and optical storage.andP;  It has operating sites inPhoenix, Ariz., and Ford Lauderdale, Fla.andM;In essence, the system captures, digitizes, sorts, transmits, archives andprints charge card images.andP;  The documents are passed along between processesvia machines called transports.andP;  Consider this:andM;* Each of four image-document transports captures images of receipts movingat speeds up to 240 inches per second, equivalent to 28 receipts each secondper transport;andM;* Images are lifted at a resolution of 200 dots per inch;andM;* 1.4 trillion bytes of write once read many (WORM) optical disk storagecapacity are contained in 11 on-line jukeboxes, each carrying 64 2G-bytedisks;andM;* Five thousand optical disks, each capable of holding 100,000 receipts, arefilled annually;andM;* Sixteen laser printers each turn out billing statements at a rate of 6,500pages per hour;andM;* Images are transmitted between the operating sites at a rate of 10 to 18images per second on TRW's wide are image-transfer network.andM;TRW integrated several vendors' hardware and software into the system.andP;  Thetwo sites, for example, feature a total of 70 customized, Unix-based 32-bitmicrocomputers for image management, billing preparation and communicationsfunctions.andP;  The network controllers come from Excelan Inc.; disk controllersfrom Interphase Corp.; and the CPU, main memory cards and VME card cages fromMizar/Integrated Solutions Inc.andM;TRW developed VME interface boards for the high-speed document transports,cameras and network communications.andP;  The company also customized the Unixoperating systems for high-speed image-transaction processing.andP;  TRW used VXWorks, a real-time operating system for Wind River Systems, for transportcontrol and communications applications.andM;FileNet Corp. provides the optical jukeboxes, while the 12-inch WORM diskdrives in the FileNet machines come from the Optical Storage Division ofLaser Magnetic Storage International Co.andP;  American Express funded TRW tore-design and integrate laser printer components from Xerox Corp. to makethem suitable for high-speed billing applications.andP;  This product wascommercially released at a later date as Xerox's 9790 laser printer.andM;TRW integrated several of its own products into the system.andP;  These includethe image-management software that controls and processes the flow of imagedata throughout the system, the hardware and software for the image-transfernetworks and the high-speed video cameras, image compressors, bar codereaders and custom optical-character recognition (OCR) readers incorporatedinto BTI Systems Inc.'s paper transports.andM;A local area network (LAN) based on the IEEE 802.3 standards interconnectshardware modules at each site.andP;  Two logical communications channels passthrough the physical network: one for data transfer, using transmissioncontrol protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) standards; and the other forimage transfer, using TRW's proprietary image-transfer protocols.andP;  TRW's Unixhas been extended to handle dual-channel data and image transfers as well.andM;Two fiber-optic lines transmit images between the sites, employing AmericanExpress' backbone T1 network.andP;  The network uses IDNX T1 multiplexers fronNetwork Equipment Technologies.andP;  These units multiplex three 448K-baud linesinto each T1 link.andP;  TRW's wide area data/image network protocols can use upto 92 per cent of this bandwidth for image transfers.andM;The paper chaseandM;In retrospect, the clumsy paper system offered a variety of opportunities forsignificant processing errors, according to Cliff Dodd, vice president ofbilling and payment services at TRS' Consumer Card Group.andP;  He is the AmericanExpress official who spear-headed the systems integration team at TRS.andM;Incoming receipts, for instance, were first microfilmed for permanent storageand then scanned by optical-character recognition (OCR) machines.andP;  The latterrecorded receipt account numbers and invoices with an 82 percent accuracyrate.andP;  Keyboard operators checked these on their terminals and manuallyentered into company computers the handwritten charge amounts, which OCRdevices could not read.andM;Receipts, also known as records of charge (ROCs), were then sent to a &quot;ROCgarden&quot; of bins, located in a room half the size of a football field.andP;  Fromhere, the millions of receipts were passed into noisy, 25-foot-longreaders/sorters.andP;  Each receipt went through up to eight sorting passes sothat it could be matched with the member's other receipts and placed in thecorrect envelope with that member's monthly billing statement.andM;The statements themselves were generated by American Express billing softwarerunning on IBM Corp. mainframe computers.andP;  There are 10 billing cycles everymonth, or one approximately every 2.3 days.andP;  Every card holder's bill isproduced in one such cycle.andM;&quot;We introduced the possibility of incremental errors every time a receipt washandled,&quot; says Dodd.andP;  &quot;Typical problems were the loss or mangling ofreceipts, misread account numbers and receipts being placed in the wrong cardholder's envelope.&quot;andM;TRS employed a staff of 182 to cope with these errors at the end of eachcycle.andP;  These people physically reviewed statement packages that appeared tohave too many or too few receipts.andP;  &quot;We knew the number of receipts thatshould be in a member's statement,&quot; says Dodd.andM;Retrieving microfilmed receipts that were needed to address member inquirieswas clumsy and time-consuming.andP;  &quot;An operator would walk to a carousel of filmcartridges, pull out a cartridge, insert it into a reader and laboriouslypage through the transparencies until the correct receipt was located,&quot;explains Dodd.andP;  &quot;The receipt was photocopied, stapled to the form requestingit and prepared for mailing or passed on to a customer-servicerepresentative.andP;  The whole thing took days.&quot;andP;  Now it's done overnight with afraction of the labor.andM;A big financial incentive also drove TRS to dig its way out of the paperblizzard: reducing the dreaded &quot;float&quot; that occurred from delays in paymentof members' bills.andP;  Card companies like MasterCard and Visa grant you creditand charge interest if you don't make a payment on time.andM;American Express, by contrast, requires you to pay statements in full,immediately upon delivery.andP;  Thus, the faster a statement is delivered, thefaster the company gets paid.andP;  Speedier payment, in turn, shrinks the amountof money American Express must maintain in accounts receivable to paymerchants who send in receipts they have processed.andP;  The last thing AmericanExpress wants to do is wait a month for payment on a receipt that should havebeen included in a previous billing cycle, or fail to receive payment due tosome processing error.andM;American Express had one other option besides moving to an image system, ormoving to one so elaborate.andP;  It could have ended the practice of sendingmembers copies of their original signed receipts.andP;  Most of its rivals, infact, have dropped this procedure, known as country club billing, because ofthe burden it places on sorting.andM;But American Express decided to maintain and enhance country club billing asa valuable service to its members.andP;  Many members use receipt copies inbusiness expense account reports and in preparing tax returns.andP;  Such copiesare also proof that the charges indicated on the billing statement wereactually made.andP;  &quot;We realized that there was no practical way to keep countryclub billing alive in a paper environment,&quot; says Dodd.andM;Modular approachandM;TRW's distributed-image systems architecture is built around several commonelements, according to Vic Elischer, executive vice president for Randamp;D.andO;Elischer and his colleagues were responsible for designing and implementingthe TRS project.andM;One such element is the use of hardware/software server modules to providebasic image-processing functions.andP;  At TRS, these modules consist of machinesfor capturing receipt images, displaying them for operations review, puttingthem into random-access magnetic storage units, transmitting them betweensites, storing them in optical-image archives at the billing site, andretrieving and printing them.andP;  This modular approach allows TRW's clients toadd machines in conjunction with increases in the client's workload, withouthaving to implement whole new systems.andM;Each server module can incorporate more than one network connection.andP;  &quot;Amultiplicity of connections is important because each image-man-agementfunction has different requirements,&quot; says Elischer.andM;For example, three pipelines are available to the random-access servers.andP;  Onereceives images from the image-capture devices, another sends images toalternate remote billing sites and the third shoots images to the opticaljukeboxes.andP;  In the future, two additional pipelines will supply images toimage character-recognition units and image key-entry workstations,respectively.andM;TRW also emphasizes using proven standards in the system, such as MS-DOS forthe key-entry terminals, TCP/IP for the LAN data-transfer channel andBerkeley Unix as the operating system for integrating the project'smicrocomputers.andP;  When it comes to data transfer, TRW's Unix is compatiblewith both ATandamp;T Co. System V Interface Definition (SVID) and the University ofCalifornia's BSD 4.3 Unix.andP;  And TRW's image-transport protocols arestructured to coexist with Berkeley's TCP/IP protocols.andP;  Both protocolsemploy the same physical media.andM;&quot;Including such standards in our system helps prevent us from becomingobsolete,&quot; says Elischer.andP;  &quot;We can plug in and integrate new technology as itappears.andP;  Standards also allow our systems to be vendor- andcomponent-independent.&quot;andM;Shoot the imagesandM;&quot;Think of TRS' system as analogous to what happens at an oil refinery,&quot; saysElischer.andP;  &quot;At a refinery, crude oil flows in and diesel oil, gasoline andother products flow out.andP;  At American Express, the raw materials are paperreceipts.andP;  These are concerted into digital images flowing through anelectronic pipeline.andP;  Various functions are performed on the images along theway to the printers.&quot;andP;  These functions are guided by capture andbilling-control computers, using TRW's image-man-agement software.andP;  The finalproducts are billing statements with images and a multibillion image archiveaccessed daily to server card holders.andM;SYSTEMS INTEGRATION magazine visited TRS' installation in Phoenix for a closeup look at one of the systems in operation.andM;Charge receipts are first fed into image-capture transport servers in theorder in which they are sent by merchants and delivered by the post office toTRS.andP;  Receipts, thus, are mixed in terms of individual card holder names.andM;The image-capture servers are high-speed document transports, commonly usedin the banking industry, to which TRW has added charge-coupled video cameras,image-compression processors, OCR equipment and related software.andP;  Within onetwenty-eighth of a second, an electronic image is captured for each piece ofpaper.andP;  The digitized picture is enhanced to increase the readability offoreground information and the digitized image data is then compressed.andM;Compression is necessary because digitized image information, which mightreach megabytes for each image, is too large for efficient processing.andP;  Evenwhen compressed with a Xerox algorithm, each receipt comprises a 17K-bytedata record.andP;  In the near future, TRW will provide American Express withCCITT Group IV compression hardware to reduce the image size to around12K-bytes.andM;Not only is the image resolution high in this system, at 200 dots per inch,but software rotates any skewed image back to the flat plane.andP;  This ensuresthat all receipts can be printed at the right angle on the pages accompaningthe billing statement.andM;While in the transport, images are scanned by OCR devices to record theaccount and invoice numbers, as in the former system.andM;Once they leave the transports, paper receipts are shredded and buried in asecret location.andP;  TRS has no further need to save the originals.andM;CCC acts like traffic copandM;Images are next sent by the capture-control computer (CCC) to random-accessimage servers, also known as capture magnetic storage units, for temporarystorage.andP;  &quot;These devices are nothing more than huge data banks for holdingand providing random access to large image records,&quot; says Elischer.andP;  Theseservers also contain indexes, created by the CCC that reference the locationof images.andP;  &quot;Thus, images can be found by means of the index, account numbersor other identification tags.&quot;andM;Images are now ready to be shuffled out of the capture units in theapproprisate order.andP;  No longer are pieces of paper passed over and overthrough mechanical sorting machines to match receipts with the rightenvelopes.andP;  Instead, the CCC acts as a traffic cop.andP;  It continuously sortsaccording to the billing-cycle information contained in receiptidentification numbers through the million-plus images that pour through thepipeline each day.andM;Lists of images, arranged by billing cycle and further subdivided by zip codeto minimize mailing costs, are sent by the CCC to computers that control theon-line optical-image archive servers, also called optical-storage andretrieval units, or jukeboxes.andP;  Jukebox controllers search the capture unitsfor the indicated images, organize them, index them and bring them togetheron the proper optical disks.andP;  A given set of disks, then, holds all the imagedata appropriate to one of the 10 monthly billing cycles.andM;The CCC plays one other role at this stage.andP;  Receipts flow into TRS'operational sites depending on where in the country a charge was originated.andO;Typically, people use a card in the area in which they live.andP;  But say youlive in the East and take a trip to the West.andP;  Charges incurred in the Westwill be sent to Phoenix: Phoenix must send them on to Fort Lauderdale formeshing with your other receipts.andM;The CCC at each site recognizes which images must be printed in the alternatelocation and sends the appropriate list to remote image servers, orcommunications link units.andP;  These function as gateways to TRS' T1 backbonewide area network.andP;  Images are transmitted across the country to thecounterpart CCC and onto the disks.andP;  As far as the system is concerned,images are handled along one big network.andM;Print and mail itandM;At the beginning of a billing cycle, the billing control computer (BCC)instructs the jukeboxes to mount the optical disks contianing receipts forthat cycle.andP;  The relevant receipt images are then passed from the disks to abilling magnetic storage unit where these images are sorted by individualaccount numbers, the way they will be printed within each zip code.andM;Images are sent by the BCC from the billing unit to statement-image printerservers, or printing control units, that mangae the high-speed laserprinters.andM;The BCC is not finished yet.andP;  Not all charges reach TRS as separate receipts.andO;Hotels, airlines, care rental agencies and similar organizations usuasllysend tape files to TRS containing information on charges for various periods.andO;These files are stored in the mainframes.andM;Mainframes also contain data on each member's name, address and accountnumber that will appear on the first page of a billing statement.andP;  All suchinformation is downloaded to the BCC via mainframe communications channelinterfaces and passed on to the printers.andM;Dual-ported storage disks included in each printer enable printers to runcontinuously, while simultaneously storing new data.andP;  The printers pick upimages from print queues according to zip codes.andP;  Presorting material by zipcode, a step done manually in the old sytem, makes it possible for TRS totake advantage of postal discounts available for presorted mail delivereddirectly to post offices.andM;TRS' printers use 8-1-/2-by-11-inch cut-sheet paper for billing statements,compared to the 3-by-7 inch bill stubs previously used.andP;  The larger sizeallows room for more information and messages to card holders.andM;In addition, up to eight two-thirds-size charge receipts casn be printed oneach page.andP;  Since receipts are printed from images of the originals at aprinting resolution of 300 dots per inch by 300 dots per inch, the images aresharper than the carbon copies that were previously sent.andP;  And each receiptis also perforated for easy removal from the sheet.andM;Moreover, the laser printers spray bar codes on each statement that instructinsertion machines to include particular direct mail ads and other materialswith card holders' bills.andM;When printing is finished, the optical disks are removed and put in racks inoff-line jukeboxes, where they remain for long-term retrieval.andP;  TRW databasesoftware tracks these disks and provides retrieval access to images on them.andO;According to Dodd, optical disks maintain their integrity for at least 20years--which is longer than microfilm.andM;Retrieving receipts in response to member inquiries is greatly simplifiedcompared to the old process.andP;  An operator keys in the account number andcharge value, which the BBC uses to retrieve the correct image from thearchival system.andP;  From archieves, the image goes to the billing units andprinters.andP;  All intermediate retrieval steps have been eliminated.andM;American Express says its billing costs have been lowered by 25 percent,thanks to the new system.andP;  &quot;Approximately 40 percent of the cost savings comefrom more efficient processing of bills to members and, thus, shorter floatperiods,&quot; says Dodd.andP;  &quot;The other 60 percent results from savings on staff andequipment.&quot;andM;For example, those 182 people formerly used for tail-end error correction areno longer needed.andP;  Three individuals now handle receipt retrieval at eachsite, instead of 210.andP;  Two image-capture servers at each site replace thenine paper-sorting transports that were formerly used, and each optical diskholds the equivalent of six filing cabinets worth of paper.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
