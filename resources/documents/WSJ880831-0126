The government said industrial production fell 0.7% in July from June, unemployment rose 0.1 percentage point to 2.5%, and the leading indicator, often taken as a barometer of future economic performance, sank further beneath the &quot;boom-or-bust&quot; line of 50 to 33.3 in June from 41.7 in May.    The Economic Planning Agency, which announced the drop in the leading indicator, considers any level above 50 as a sign of impending economic expansion, while a level below 50 often heralds contraction.    Nevertheless, one EPA economist said, &quot;We aren't especially worried. We think the basic trend will remain unchanged and the economy will continue to expand, though maybe at a slower pace.&quot;    Meantime, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry reported that production at Japan's factories and mines rose 8% in July from a year earlier, though it fell 0.7% on an adjusted basis from June. The latest figures compared with an 8.9% year-on-year increase and a 2.6% month-on-month rise for the month of June.    A ministry official said the data in the latest reporting month basically represents a &quot;sideward motion&quot; in the level of Japan's industrial and mining production. The still-robust year-on-year rise is regarded as a sign that the country's manufacturing industries remain fundamentally sound, he said.    The July unemployment figure, reported by the Statistics Bureau, wasn't viewed with concern. For one thing, it was only an uptick from the lowest jobless rate -- 2.4% in June -- in more than five and one-half years. For another, bureau officials said the latest statistics indicate Japanese employers remain eager to hire people to keep pace with strong domestic demand. Indeed, data released separately by the Labor Ministry showed that there were 109 job offers last month for every 100 Japanese looking for work.    Meanwhile, a Japanese think tank predicted that Japan's economy will continue its strong growth for the rest of the century, powered by increases in personal spending and private-sector capital investment.    The Research Institute on the National Economy estimated annual growth will average 4.7%, after adjustment for inflation, through the year 2000. It also foresees a steady narrowing of the trade surplus to about $600 million that year from $94.3 billion in the fiscal year ended last March. </TEXT></DOC>
