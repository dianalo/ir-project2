Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Crp., is``looking at the abyss. The evil empire is tottering,'' Wright B.George, a member of the Eastern master executive council of the AirLine Pilots Association, said in an interview Sunday.   Sixteen months of talks on wages between Miami-based Eastern andthe International Association of Machinists have resulted in nosettlement, and the union will be free to strike legally March 4 ifa 30-day cooling-off period mandated by the National Mediation Boardexpires without a new contract.   The cooling-off period expires at midnight EST March 3.Intensified talks involving Eastern management, the Machinists andfederal mediators are due to start on Wednesday in Washington.   The two unions representing pilots and flight attendants atEastern have said they would honor any picket line set up by themachinists, who represent about 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlersand other ground personnel.   ``We understand the risk (of striking),'' George said. ``Theworst thing that can happen to us is that we lose our jobs.''   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami said the airline is``guardedly optimistic'' that the dispute will be settled without astrike.   ``We don't want a strike. A strike is not in the company's or theunions' best interest,'' he said. Matell reiterated Eastern's vow tocontinue operating in the event of a strike.   Many financial analysts and other observers believe a bruisingstrike against Eastern could jeopardize the airline's survival.   Eastern recently reported a record net loss of $335.4 million in1988, nearly double its $181.7 million loss the year before. Revenuedropped to $3.8 billion from $4.4 billion in 1987.   The airline's latest contract offer to the machinists calls for$150 million in wage cuts.   George conceded that Lorenzo could well put Eastern into Chapter11 bankruptcy, liquidate its assets or sell it outright.   He said pilots union officials have set up a meeting with WallStreet analysts and Eastern creditors later this week in New York todiscuss the risk to creditors if there is a strike. The pilots helda similar session with analysts alone last September.   Eastern currently has $550 million to $650 million in cashreserves, roughly equivalent to its accounts payable, George said.   Matell put the reserve figure at around $400 million.   ``Eastern has substantial cash reserves,'' the spokesman said.``We keep our creditors well informed, and they know that they haveno cause for concern.''   George insisted a strike will occur ``if rational heads don'tprevail.'' The 3,400 Eastern pilots, he said, have been seekingtalks with management for months with job security their primaryissue.   Tom Matthews, Eastern's senior vice president for human resourcesand chief labor negotiator, has told the pilots the company plans tocontact their union on Tuesday to discuss a schedule fornegotiations.   However, Matell said, talks with the pilots have been made moredifficult by Wednesday's scheduled start of ``super-mediation'' withthe Machinists, which will tie up Eastern's top negotiators. He saidthe situation also has been complicated by the pilots union havingrecently changed the members of its negotiating committee.</TEXT></DOC>
