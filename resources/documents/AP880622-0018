The comments of Walter R. Edgington, then vice president of GTEGovernment Systems Corp., meshed with remarks by a former Pentagoninvestigator Tuesday that the Justice Department had ``substantiveevidence that there was massive fraud'' in military weaponspurchases three years ago.   Robert L. Segal, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agentwho investigated procurement fraud cases at the Pentagon for oneyear until his resignation in January 1985, said there was``extensive evidence'' of wrongdoing even though only a handful ofcompanies were charged.   GTE Government Systems was one of the companies against whichcriminal charges were brought nearly three years ago after aninvestigation by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service forwhich Segal worked.   The widespread Pentagon investigation now under way centers onallegations that defense contractors and consultants bribedPentagon officials to obtain inside information that would givethem a competitive advantage in the multimillion dollar procurementsweepstakes.   Edgington and Bernie Zettl, a former GTE consultant, wereindicted on charges of espionage and theft of government property,while Robert R. Carter, a former GTE marketing manager, was chargedwith participating in the alleged conspiracy.   The company agreed to plead guilty and was fined $500,000. Butnearly three years after the indictment, the rest of the case stillhas not come to trial, and all charges have been dropped except aconspiracy count against Zettl.   Delays have resulted from lengthy legal disputes over therelease of classified material.   On Feb. 29, 1984, Edgington was interviewed by two Pentagoninvestigators, according to a document in the court file. Thedefense contractor told the agents that when he first started withGTE in 1966, ``everyone within the office had unauthorizedclassified documents.''   To get a handle on all of the paper, Edgington said, he got ``agood sergeant major and put all the documents in the file room sothat they could at least be controlled,'' according to the reporton the interview.   ``Every major corporation gets the same material,'' Edgingtontold the agents, but he declined to reveal names of other companieswith the unauthorized material.   Edgington did say that Zettl provided the documents to a GTEemployee who routed them to the proper people inside the company.The GTE vice president said he never asked Zettl how he came uponthe material because he wasn't interested.   Edgington defended possession of classified documents as a toolin ``major technical planning.'' The information saves thegovernment money by cutting down on start-up time for projects, hesaid.   When one agent asked Edgington why he didn't shut the documenttrafficking operation down once he knew about it, he replied: ``Ifyou already have your feet in the mud, why take a shower, you stillcan't get rid of past dirt.''   At his news conference, Segal, now a stockbroker in suburbanSpringfield, Va., said he concluded three years ago that briberyand fraud in Pentagon procurement were common.   Segal was supposed to testify at a Senate subcommittee Oct. 1,1985, but was blocked by the Justice Department which claimed histestimony would have harmed an ongoing criminal case.   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the subcommittee chairman at thetime, contends that the current Pentagon bribery probe could havestarted three years ago had the Justice Department not stifledSegal's allegations.   Attorney General Edwin Meese III, has defended the JusticeDepartment's role.   In a related development Tuesday, Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., saidthe congressional General Accounting Office estimates that thePentagon spent $2.8 billion on consultants in fiscal 1987. ThePentagon has said it spent $155 million.   Pryor said the GAO estimate, high as it is, may still be far toolow. He said the GAO estimated that consulting costs might run ashigh as $18 billion a year.</TEXT></DOC>
