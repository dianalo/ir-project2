These activitiesstarted in 1984 with the conversion of a passenger bus. Another majorproject was converting a 350-ton car and passenger ferry. The enginesof this ferry use a 50-50 diesel-gas fuel mix at idle, and 88% gas atcruising speed. Engine power and response is identical to operation ondiesel fuel only, but engine noise is reduced noticeably. Another ferryis also being converted, and savings of $120,000/y in fuel costs areexpected when both vessels are in operation. Conversions are also beingcarried out on trucks, including those on freight runs to the USA; naturalgas refuelling is done in Vancouver and Seattle. To promote natural gasas a fuel for diesel trucks, a demonstration project was set up, involvinga service station near the Trans Canada highway specially designed tofuel trucks with natural gas, to convert diesel vehicles to dual fueloperation, and to monitor the results of such conversions and disseminatethis information to the diesel industry. A computerized card system enableseasy monitoring of the users of the facility.</TEXT></DOC>
