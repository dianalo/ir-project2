Data acquisition will use Camac systems controlledby LSI-11 computers operating under RT-11. The data will be transferredvia an Ethernet LAN to a VAX data management computer. Data storage andarchive will use optical discs providing on-line storage for 1 1/2 to3 Gbytes and a retrieval time of 1 to 2 minutes for off-line data. Set-upand performance parameters from the programmable controller operatedMachine Control System will be stored as part of the raw data. Controlof the output power of the ECRH system will be shared between the MachineControl System and the Data System.</TEXT></DOC>
