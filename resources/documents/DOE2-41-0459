The nuclear magnetic resonance tomography at plantsis one of the new potential application fields. In particular the nuclearmagnetic resonance tomography based on the fluorine 19 isotope promisesnew knowledge in biochemical and medical research. Application possibilitiesof electron paramagnetic resonance tomography allowing statements aboutthe spatial distribution of paramagnetic centers and about the spectraldistribution in limited spatial regions are illustrated.</TEXT></DOC>
