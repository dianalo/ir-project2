SimpsonStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AEROSPACE (ARO)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lear Siegler Holdings Corp. said it agreed to sell three of its aerospace units to Smiths Industries PLC, a British aerospace and industrial products company, for a total of $350 million.    The proposed sale is part of Lear Siegler's previously announced plan to divest itself of most of its aerospace group. Another aerospace subsidiary was sold earlier for $28 million.    Theodore J. Forstmann, a general partner in Forstmann Little andamp; Co., Lear Siegler's parent, said sales of the remaining units would &quot;be accomplished in a very short while.&quot; Proceeds from the sales will be used to reduce Lear Siegler's debt.    Lear Siegler Holdings was created when Forstmann Little completed a $2.1 billion leveraged buyout of Lear Siegler Inc., an aerospace and industrial company based in Santa Monica, Calif. Forstmann Little is a private investment firm that specializes in leveraged buyouts, transactions in which a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    The units involved in the proposed transaction with Smiths Industries are Lear Siegler Instrument andamp; Avionic Systems Corp., which makes defense electronics equipment; Lear Siegler International Corp., the division's marketing and distribution arm; and Lear Siegler Avionics Systems Holding Corp., a non-operating unit. The eight companies in the aerospace group are estimated to have had revenue totaling $700 million for the year ended June 30. In fiscal 1986, Lear Siegler had total revenue of $2.5 billion.    In London, Smiths Industries said the transaction, which is contingent on the approval of its shareholders and U.S. regulatory agencies, is expected to be completed by Aug. 20. The British concern said it would finance the acquisition with an offering of common stock to current holders on the basis of one share for every three held.    Smiths Industries said the proposed acquisition would strengthen its growth opportunities in the aerospace business. British analysts seemed to agree. Philip Ayton, an analyst with London-based BZW Securities Inc., termed the purchase price &quot;very reasonable&quot; and predicted that &quot;assimilation will be rapid.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
