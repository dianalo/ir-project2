However,the principle of high temperature superconductivity is not yet clarified.By the sequential record-breakthrough on the critical temperature, thetechnical innovation of superconductivity is expected not only to blowa new wind into the industrial world but to accelerate the informationaland software trends. If the super-conductivity reaches the ordinary temperaturelevel, it will expand its application widely to energy, electronics,traffic and transportation, and medical fields on the basis of the above-mentionedcharacteristics. However, although the superconductivity buisiness isexpected as big as 6 trillion yen in 2000 and 17 trillion in 2010, itis too quick to take it for granted. Competition with the competitivetechnology (e.g., magnetic levitation train and Shinkansen) should becarefully considered. This report especially considered the overall prospectof the superconducting power storage, generation and power transmission.(14 figs, 7 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
