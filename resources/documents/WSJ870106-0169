This is an old tale. In the '50s, on the pretext of having &quot;fallen behind in bombers,&quot; the U.S. military obtained large allocations from Congress. After the aircraft had been built, however, it was &quot;discovered&quot; that the Americans had deliberately exaggerated the number of Soviet bombers three to four times over. In the early '60s, a howl was raised about a &quot;missile gap,&quot; and the U.S. initiated a massive deployment of land-based ICBMs. Then, after more than a thousand had been deployed, it turned out that the Soviet &quot;missile threat&quot; had been exaggerated 15 to 20 times over.    Now, in connection with SDI, some people in the U.S. resort again to the old trick. The Soviet Union's fundamental approach is that the sides must renounce the making of space-strike weapons and destroy available anti-satellite systems. My country is not pursuing research to develop ABM space systems. There are studies to improve warning systems against a missile attack, verification technology, communications and navigation systems, and to develop ground-based ABM defense within the limits of the ABM treaty. But we are honoring the treaty fully.    Under the treaty, our two countries agreed not to deploy ABM systems for the defense of their national territory, nor provide a basis for such a defense. The agreement allowed each side to deploy only two ABM complexes -- one around its capital and the other around an area containing silo launchers for ICBMs. Subsequently, the number of permitted ABM deployment areas was reduced to one for each side. The Soviet side chose Moscow.    The Krasnoyarsk radar station upon completion will deal exclusively with tracking space objects and monitoring outer space. It has nothing to do with the ABM treaty, as will become clear when the station begins operating.    In Iceland, the Soviet leader proposed a mechanism for strengthening the ABM treaty -- not using the right to pull out of the treaty for the 10 years it will take to totally reduce and destroy the nuclear potentials of our countries. There was agreement in principle by the two sides to scrap in 10 years &quot;all nuclear devices.&quot; The only issue undecided was SDI.    To ensure that neither country would seek to overtake the other in space research and thus achieve military superiority, Moscow said: We are for laboratory research and testing but against taking that research and the testing of components of space-based ABM defenses into outer space. As a method of testing U.S. sincerity, my country proposed joint laboratory experiments, but this offer met no enthusiasm in America.    On the other hand, the American SDI program provides for developing multipurpose offensive weapons which would have a fighting range of 4,000 to 5,000 kilometers and could be used to destroy not only targets in outer space but also targets on earth from space. Those would be instant-action global weapons which could appear above any country and be used for political and military blackmail.    Mr. Kucewicz also wrote about a Soviet &quot;deliberate shift&quot; to a war-fighting capability. The chief principle underlying Soviet military doctrine has always implied that the U.S.S.R. must be prepared to deliver a retaliatory strike involving defensive actions. Because the U.S.S.R. considers nuclear attack a grave crime against mankind, the Soviet strategic nuclear arsenal has never been regarded in the U.S.S.R. as a &quot;strategic offensive force,&quot; as it is frequently referred to in the U.S. Soviet military doctrine proceeds from the assumption that the U.S.S.R. will never be the first to use nuclear weapons.    As early as August 1983 the Soviet Union took a unilateral pledge not to be the first to orbit any anti-satellite weapons. It is very easy to check on observance of that obligation, since orbital observations by all Soviet satellites have been published and are well known throughout the world.    Alexander Malyshkin   Senior Information Officer   Soviet Embassy   Washington   ---   Mr. Kucewicz quotes a Center for Defense Information statement: &quot;Claims that the Soviets might beat us into space with an SDI of their own are vastly overstated. . . .&quot; It would have been helpful if he had included quotes from Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, director of the SDI project, which accompanied and supported our conclusions:    &quot;We do know {the Soviets} have invested heavily in directed energy systems, but it's very hard to see concrete results. . . . Are they dramatically better off? No. . . . In the key technologies needed for a broader defense -- such as data-processing and computer software -- we are far, far ahead.&quot;    Gen. Abrahamson's judgment is supported by the testimony of the Joint Chiefs, who reported to Congress that the U.S. was ahead in 14 of the most important basic-technology areas while the Soviets were equal in six and superior in none.    The real &quot;smoking gun&quot; concerning superiority, however, was evident in Secretary Weinberger's words when he told the armed services that the Defense Department &quot;will accelerate those areas of technology offering the potential for significant military advantage and develop those space systems that have been shown to enhance the U.S. military balance of power.&quot; No one can exploit inferiority to achieve military advantage.    Finally, Mr. Weinberger gave the game away when he wrote that the U.S. &quot;must ensure that treaties and agreements do not foreclose opportunities to develop these {military space} capabilities.&quot; Common sense says that we would be more than ready to foreclose Soviet opportunities to develop space systems if we thought that their technology was superior to ours. In truth, the U.S. is superior and all of the talk about Soviet superiority is specious justification for expanding the nuclear battleground into space in order to achieve military advantage over the Soviet Union.
