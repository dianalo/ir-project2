The test, which is scheduled to start next year, will bethe first time a U.S. phone company has tried to use digitalradio transmission in its &quot;local loop&quot; to deliverconventional telephone service in metropolitan areas. Nynexsaid a wireless system eventually could improve service at asignificant cost savings. Currently, some phone companiesprovide radio links to remote farms, ranches and tinymountain communities.</LP><TEXT>   The regional Bell company said it plans to use radiotransmission between New York Telephone facilities andresidential areas of New York City, Boston and White Plains,N.Y. Nynex said it will test two different digital radiotechnologies known as Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). The digitaltechnologies increase the capacity of transmissions overradio frequencies compared with current analog technology.   The FCC generally approves experimental licenses as longas the tests don't interfere with existing service. But theagency makes no guarantee that spectrum allocated for a testof new technology will be made available on a permanentbasis.   &quot;This is along the same lines as our investigation offiber optics,&quot; said Ken Raymond, director at the NynexScience and Technology Center. &quot;Given the population densityof an area and the age of the existing telephone plant, we'retrying to determine whether a wireless application might makesense.&quot;   Mr. Raymond said that later this year the company will askequipment suppliers for proposals on building the wirelesssystem. The company, he said, is trying to find out ifcustomers would receive better service, or at least the sameservice as they currently receive, if the link from theirbuilding or neighborhood to the New York Telephone facilityis made over radio waves. Initially customers should noticeno difference in their phone service, he said. But in 1992,the company may introduce a portable phone that customerscould use around their neighborhoods, much like a cordlessphone with an extended range of a block or so.   On Wednesday, Nynex announced that its MobileCommunications Co. unit plans to roll out the nation's firstwireless personal telephone service in Manhattan. Thatservice will rely on the emerging CDMA technology.   CDMA systems can offer up to 20 times the call-handlingcapacity of current cellular telephone systems. The CDMAsystems assign an electronic code to each call signal,allowing more calls to occupy the same space and be spreadover an entire frequency band.   TDMA, the generally accepted standard for future digitaltransmission, places each call signal into a time slot andtransmits it within a single frequency. TDMA offers three toseven times the capacity of current cellular systems.   Nynex didn't disclose the amount it expects to spend onthe experiment.</TEXT></DOC>
