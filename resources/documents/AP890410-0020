Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, called the godfather of Mexicandrug trafficking, was arrested late Saturday in Guadalajara in thewestern state of Jalisco, the prosecutor's office said in astatement.   Numerous high-powered weapons were also seized by members of theFederal Judicial Police, the statement said. It said FelixGallardo, 43, put up no resistance. He is thought to run one of thelargest cocaine trafficking operations in the world.   A U.S. official welcomed news of the arrest. ``We're delightedto hear that. This is most interesting,'' said William Graves, aU.S. embassy spokesman, on Sunday night.   The government news agency Notimex reported that Felix Gallardoand four others also arrested have been flown to Mexico City, 300miles east of Guadalajara.   In another development, authorities said the entire police forceof the city of Culiacan, in the northwestern state of Sinaloa, wasarrested in a massive sweep Saturday night.   All 70 to 80 police officers were set free Sunday with theexception of Police Chief Robespier Lisarraja and State PoliceChief Arturo Moreno, who remained in military custody at a localarmy base, said Jorge Gonzalez, spokesman for the federal attorneygenerals' office in Culiacan.   Gonzalez could not say why the entire police force was arrestedor on what charges the chiefs were being held. Culiacan is FelixGallardo's hometown and has long had a reputation for officialcorruption.   Agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration long hadsuspected Felix Gallardo of involvement in the 1985 slaying offellow agent Enrique Camarena Salazar, but were unable to locatehim.   U.S. officials investigating Camarena killing said FelixGallardo was able to build up an immense drug operation withprotection from high Mexican officials, including a state governor.   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took office on Dec. 1,has pledged to crack down on drug dealers, and the arrestunderlines Salinas' vow to ``fight this social cancer,'' theattorney general's office said.   Called the godfather of Mexican drug trafficking, Felix Gallardohad such good connections that U.S. drug agents said Mexican agentswere afraid to find him, according to the recently published book``Desperados'' by Elaine Shannon.   Felix Gallardo was at one time a member of the Sinaloa statepolice and bodyguard for former Gov. Leopoldo Sanchez Celis until1980. The DEA believes he introduced cocaine smuggling to Mexicanmarijuana rings in the mid-1970s, Shannon said.   At one time in the mid-1980s the DEA believed Felix Gallardo wasresponsible for the smuggling of 1{ to 2 tons of cocaine monthlyfrom South America into the United States, according to Shannon'sbook.   The United States has been pressuring Mexico to stem the flow ofdrugs across the border. Mexico has countered that the U.S. demandfor drugs fuels the Mexican narcotics trade.   Some U.S. congressmen, including Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., haveaccused Mexico of widespread official corruption and maintain thatcertification should be denied.</TEXT></DOC>
