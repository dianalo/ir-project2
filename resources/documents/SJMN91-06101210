Since the 1960s, about 2million American women have undergone breast implant surgery, according to theAmerican Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons.;    More than 130,000women are expected to get breast implants this year. About 80 percent areseeking augmentation, while 20 percent have lost their breasts to cancer.;   But some of the known problems with breast implants cited by the FDA includedpost-surgical infection, pain, hardening of the breast tissue surrounding theimplant, implant breakage and subsequent leakage of the silicone-gel fillinginto the body.;    &quot;Questions have also been raised about other potentialunknown long-term risks such as immune reactions and carcinogenicity&quot; of theimplants, the FDA said Tuesday.;    A leading manufacturer of breast implantspredicted the FDA would give the devices a clean bill of health.;    &quot;Thesedevices are generally safe and effective,&quot; said Robert T. Rylee II, vicepresident of Dow Corning in Midland, Mich., a leading maker of breastimplants. &quot;But as with many implantable devices, there are certain risks bothin just a surgical procedure and those that would be peculiar to the deviceitself.&quot;;    Among the risks Rylee cited were rupture of the device, which hesaid happened in less than 1 percent of the devices made by Dow Corning,allowing silicone gel to enter the body.;    Recent findings suggest that somewomen who receive the implants may be allergic to the silicone.;    &quot;I feltlike I was being poisoned. I felt like somebody had slipped me a mickey,&quot; saidDenise Peasley, 37, of Santa Ana, who had her breasts enlarged 12 years ago.&quot;To walk up the stairs, you felt like you exercised five hours in aerobics.&quot;;   Peasley, who was diagnosed as having lupus, said her symptoms had graduallysubsided since she had the implants removed in a second surgery last May.;   Dr. Dennis Lynch, a plastic surgeon from Temple, Texas, said the problemdescribed by Peasley is extremely rare, striking perhaps 100 of the 2 millionwomen who have undergone the surgery.;    But Dr. Frank Vasey, a professor ofmedicine from the University of South Florida, said chronic immune reactioncould strike 1 percent of all those who receive the implants, or more than1,000 women a year.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GREGORY SPEARS, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910410  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  612  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday April 10, 199100101210,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
