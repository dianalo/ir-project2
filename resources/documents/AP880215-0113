A draft summary of a major, just-completed National Park Serviceassessment of the condition of natural and cultural resources lists``encroachment by plants and animals not native to parkenvironments'' ahead of any other ``major issues and threats'' tonatural resources.   Sometimes the invasion is part of the ebb and flow of nature, aswith gypsy moths attacking trees in Virginia's Shenandoah NationalPark. Sometimes it is the end of a complex process kicked off byhumans, as in the replacement of sawgrass with cat-tail plants inthe Everglades National Park in Florida as a result offertilizer-laden water entering the swamp. That changes the wholefood chain in the park.   Sometimes it isn't easy to decide, as with the ravages ofvegetation caused by wild pigs in the Great Smoky MountainsNational Park in Tennessee and North Carolina or goats in OlympicNational Park in Washington State, or the invasion of kudzu oreucalyptus at several sites in the South or West.   Sometimes nothing can really be done as nature slowly replacesone species with another over the course of a century or so.   In an interview, parks director William Penn Mott said: ``In theFlorida everglades we have the invasion of the Brazilian pepper; wehave the invasion of the Australian pine. ... It may be there is noway on God's green earth that we can eliminate the pepper, forexample. ... Over a period of time, it may be that will be theecology of the Florida Everglades.''   Mott's deputy, Denis P. Galvin, added, ``It seems to me one ofthe roles of the national parks is to illustrate that kind ofprocess.''   There are few really new individual facts about exotic speciesin the study, just their appearance in different places.   ``What the assessment points out is that exotic plants andanimals are a problem in more places than we would have thought,''said Galvin.   The study, launched by Mott when he took over the service twoyears ago, is the first of its kind since park managers were askedto list threats to their units in 1980. Results of the exercise,which will be repeated every three years, have been computerizedfor easy access throughout the park system.   Funds from new and increased visitor fees will be directed atwhat park managers judge the most important problems uncovered inthe assessment. This will mean an extra $52 million a year beforecollection expenses, with 10 percent of the net reserved for aspecial director's discretionary fund, to be spent on research andprotection of resources or interpretation for visitors.   Nearly 60 percent of park managers said their installations werethreatened in one way or another, one-third of them by activitiesoutside park boundaries.   Most natural resources were judged in fair condition, with only15 percent described as poor. But the managers said they needed toundertake 2,500 projects over the next three years at what theservice estimated would be $250 million to $300 million, a sum itnoted ``far exceeds the current NPS budget.''   For cultural resources _ roughly half the units in the systemcommemorate something _ managers said a quarter of the sites, athird of the buildings and a third of the collections were in goodcondition. Most sites and structures that are well-documented ``arerelatively free of serious adverse impacts.''   ``But the status of many cultural resources is unknown becauseof an enormous backlog of historical research, documentation,inspections and cataloguing,'' the summary said in noting that only12 percent of its museum collections had been catalogued.   Major problem categories for natural resources _ many alsolisted in the 1980 report _ were described as scars from mining,grazing or farming; overuse; hunting or poaching; legal mineralexploitation; loss of water and air quality, as from acid rain; anddevelopment near park boundaries.   Cultural resources were said to be threatened by weathering anderosion; vandalism and looting; deficient storage of artifacts; apaperwork backlog; lack of vegetation control and lack ofspecialized expertise.</TEXT></DOC>
