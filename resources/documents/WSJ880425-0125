In a declassified version of their annual report to the congressional Joint Economic Committee, made public yesterday, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency concluded that: &quot;. . . Soviet citizens will need to see some improvement in living standards if the regime is to achieve necessary gains in worker productivity and avoid widespread discontent. Although Gorbachev appears to be working against no set timetable, failure to head off these tensions would, at a minimum, make it more difficult to pursue his economic program vigorously and could, ultimately, call into question his strong political position at home.&quot;    Mr. Gorbachev and some of his allies have acknowledged that their reform proposals have met stiff resistance in some quarters. Moscow Communist Party chief Boris Yeltsin was fired in November after complaining that the reforms had gotten bogged down. Last week the Soviets played down reports of new tensions, this time between Mr. Gorbachev and Yegor Ligachev, the second-ranking member of the ruling Politburo, who reportedly favors a slower pace of reform.    Last year, the CIA and DIA said, the chronic problems of poor weather and transportation bottlenecks were compounded by Mr. Gorbachev's disruptive reform efforts, and Soviet GNP grew by only 0.5%, compared with 3.9% in 1986, Mr. Gorbachev's first full year in power.    Industry, hit hard by Moscow's efforts to tie wages to productivity, improve quality control, cut bureaucratic red tape, and encourage self-financing, grew only about 1.5%, down from 2.5% in 1986. The critical civilian machine-building industry didn't grow at all, and agricultural production fell 3% from last year's record output, the report said.    &quot;In light of these problems, the short-term outlook for Gorbachev's economic program is not good,&quot; the intelligence agencies concluded, predicting that Soviet GNP will grow at an average of less than 2% a year for the next two years.    In order to inject momentum into his often-conflicting reform plans, the report said, Mr. Gorbachev may be forced to pursue more joint ventures with Western firms and import more heavily from the West and Japan, especially in sectors such as energy and machine tools. He also may have to divert resources from defense, which now claims 15% to 17% of Soviet GNP, or divert investment from energy and agriculture.    An important test of Mr. Gorbachev's political strength and of the momentum of his reform agenda probably will come this June, at an unusual All-Union Party Conference, the first of its kind since 1941, the report said. Mr. Gorbachev has invested a great deal of political capital in the conference, which apparently will be empowered to replace perhaps a fourth of the members of the Communist Party's Central Committee, and the agenda includes a review of recent economic progress, the CIA and DIA said. </TEXT></DOC>
