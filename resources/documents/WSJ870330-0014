Tokyo officials believe that there is still time to negotiate an amicable settlement before the quotas are imposed April 17 and that the problem will be solved without a trade war. They also insisted that Japanese companies were complying with last summer's semiconductor pact with the U.S., which was supposed to limit dumping of computer chips and improve U.S. access to the Japanese market. And some Japanese said privately that the tariff threat was just the latest evidence of the U.S. belief that Japan is the enemy, not an ally.    Still, the U.S. threat may be having the additional effect of finally pushing the Japanese government to stimulate its economy as the U.S. repeatedly has demanded. Some news reports Sunday speculated that Japanese government agencies also are preparing to purchase U.S. supercomputers, another prickly trade issue that played a role in the U.S. decision to impose punitive sanctions.    &quot;We find it impossible to understand the decision by the U.S.,&quot; said Hajime Tamura, the minister of international trade and industry, who remained calm and conciliatory during a news conference Saturday. &quot;It's simply a matter of time. We have confidence that the steps we've already taken will have visible results.&quot;    Nonetheless, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said it has asked for an emergency meeting with U.S. trade negotiators. But if the U.S. carries out its threat, the ministry said, it would consider scrapping last year's semiconductor agreement and filing a complaint with the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, alleging that the U.S. action violates international trade accords.    MITI said it isn't taking any additional steps to satisfy the Americans. &quot;We don't have any magic tricks that we can use to resolve the problem,&quot; a ministry spokesman said. &quot;What we fear most is if the communication stops.&quot; MITI denies that Japanese companies are dumping semiconductors in Southeast Asia and Europe at prices below production costs. It has charged U.S. and South Korean companies are doing that.    Some action is being taken behind the scenes, however. The ministry was making private requests Friday that electronic companies begin the immediate purchase of U.S. chips in an effort to boost U.S. companies' market share in Japan. Each company is being told to substitute a certain percentage of its chips from Japanese suppliers. &quot;We have to negotiate with our suppliers, and that takes time,&quot; says a spokesman for Toshiba Corp. The Japanese semiconductor industry already is trying to comply with recent ministry requests to cut back production.    The Electronic Industries Association of Japan pledged Saturday to achieve visible results, possibly in two weeks before the tariffs are imposed. But the group maintained the U.S. was &quot;premature and even irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of the agreement and our efforts to comply with it only six months after concluding the agreement.&quot; The trade group also stated a commonly expressed Japanese sentiment: The lack of progress in this trade dispute is the U.S. companies' fault. &quot;American semiconductor manufacturers may not really be interested in participating in the Japanese market,&quot; said the chairman of the group, Shoichi Saba.    Officials at some Japanese companies said they are pinning their hopes on American retailers of Japanese products. They said retailers will object loudly to the tariff plan at public hearings in mid-April because prices of a broad range of products will double. Then maybe the administration will back down, they said. &quot;This isn't wine and Brie that we are talking about. Regular people buy our products at Sears,&quot; said an industry analyst. Some estimates put the damage to the Japanese electronics appliance industry as high as $10 billion.    Industry analysts in Japan are skeptical that any progress can be made in a short time. &quot;There is nothing the Japanese companies can do in two weeks that makes any difference,&quot; said Carole A. Ryavec, analyst with Salomon Brothers. Another analyst suggested that the only way to show progress would be for MITI to buy U.S. chips and sell them for the U.S. companies because &quot;the cultural barriers against U.S. products still exist.&quot;    The Japanese have few options for striking back. The country could ban the export of semiconductors to the U.S. -- Japan makes the majority of certain kinds of chips -- or ban the import of certain U.S. agriculture products. But such bold and openly antagonistic moves would be uncharacteristic of Japanese trade relations. These ideas are said to have next to no support in the MITI or in the Foreign Ministry. &quot;We know we are pretty much powerless,&quot; said one official.    The confrontational U.S. approach points up Japan's weakness and is disheartening, a few Japanese officials said privately. Another recent example was the U.S. scuttling -- for national security reasons -- of Fujitsu Ltd.'s plan to buy Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., the California semiconductor unit of Schlumberger Ltd. Said one Japanese trade negotiator, &quot;The U.S. repeatedly holds a gun to our head (on these trade issues) and when we ask what we get in return, they say, 'We won't pull the trigger.'&quot;    The heightened level of trade friction adds to the domestic political troubles of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and will complicate his state visit to the U.S. April 29 to May 5. Just what Mr. Nakasone can hope to do on the trip is unclear. News reports in Japan say that Mr. Nakasone won't address Congress but will speak to important congressional leaders in private sessions in an effort to defuse trade tension.    In the eyes of American leaders, Mr. Nakasone has staked his reputation on reducing the U.S. trade deficit and trade barriers and stimulating the Japanese economy so Japanese will buy more imported products. Yet during his tenure, many U.S. critics have seen little progress. Trade surpluses with the U.S. have grown and U.S. negotiators have an unending list of trade complaints against Japan.    But after news of the planned punitive tariffs hit Japan Friday, Mr. Nakasone announced a plan for a series of pump-priming measures that he said will stimulate the economy and theoretically, at least, help to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. So far, he has been unable to push any measures through the parliament because intense opposition to his sales tax plan by opposition parties and flagging support for the tax plan in his own party have bottled up legislation. If local elections scheduled for April 12 go against his party, he may find himself in greater difficulty and may have to resign, political analysts said.    ---            Ten Years of U.S.-Japan Trade Disputes   1977 -- U.S. complains that Japan is restricting importsof American beef and citrus.
