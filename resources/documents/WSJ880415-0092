Credit Lyonnais added 5.33 billion francs to its provisions for loans to problem debtor countries, down 14% from the 6.21 billion francs it added to such provisions in 1986. The smaller contribution coincided with a drop in the group's exposure, leaving these provisions equivalent to 43.2% of exposure to 60 countries, compared with coverage of 33% of exposure to 45 countries in 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
