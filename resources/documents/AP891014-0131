(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The launching of the ballistic missilesubmarine USS West Virginia on Saturday is proof of thegovernment's comittment to a strong, battle-ready Navy, said Sen.Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.   Thirteen peace activists were arrested for trying to block theentrance to the Electric Boat shipyard where the ceremony was held.The protesters were charged with criminal trespass and released.   The West Virginia, an Ohio-class sub which costs $1.6 billion,will be delivered to the Navy next year. It is equipped to fireTrident missiles.   Byrd said during the ceremony that anyone ``who might conspireto disturb world peace or who are foolish enough to attack theUnited States or threaten its international interests would be welladvised to take note of today's christening of the West Virginia.''   But he said, ``if we ever were to launch the missiles of theWest Virginia, our basic goal, to deter war, would have failed.''   The 560-foot submarine has 24 missile tubes and can carry theTrident 2 or D-5 missile.   The West Virginia is the first submarine and the third Navy shipto bear the name. The others were the cruiser West Virginia, whichin 1920 was renamed the Huntington, and the battleship WestVirginia, which survived the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor.</TEXT></DOC>
