(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Kumar, Vijay; Waldron, Kenneth J.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A fast and computationally efficient suboptimal method isdeveloped for computing the distribution of grasping forces inmultifingered grippers.andP;  Force control in such grippers requiresdetermination of the contact forces between each finger and thegripped object.andP;  The new method models contacts as contact points,load wrench is balanced by finger contact forces, and any threeforce components (but no moments) can be applied by a finger.andO;Equilibrium forces for holding the object without squeezing andinteraction forces between fingers for preventing slippage offingers are also determined.andP;  Three simple grippers demonstratethe effectiveness of the method.andP;  Details of the formulation ofthe method are described.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     ManipulatorsAlgorithmsSystem DesignControl SystemsDynamics.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Reference frames for the gripper-object system.
