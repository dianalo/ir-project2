Many voters interviewed shared that view but expressed concernthat ``widespread corruption'' would heighten political instabilitybefore the Olympic Games, opening Sept. 17 in Seoul.   ``I am afraid the elections would cause new problems rather thansolve them,'' Kang Han-ik, 21, a college student, said. Kang andmany others predicted a flood of lawsuits disputing results of thiselection, which follows the first direct presidential election in16 years.   In the presidential voting in December, Roh Tae-woo of thegoverning Democratic Justice Party won with 36 percent of the vote.But opposition charges of rigging in that election won littlesupport from the public, irritated by the opposition's inability tounite.   Violence, corrupt campaigning and the alleged use of governmentinfluence to help governing party candidates became issues again inthis campaign.   Since the official 18-day campaign began, no day passed withoutreports of scuffles among rival party supporters, firebomb attackson candidates or party offices and other violence. Scores wereinjured, although exact figures were not available, and 150 peoplewere reported detained by police.   Many people interviewed said they were most concerned by reportsof widespread efforts to buy votes with meals, gifts and cash. Thegoverning Democratic Justice Party announced it was expelling onecandidate after authorities reported finding thousands ofenvelopes, each stuffed with the equivalent of $30 in cash, readyfor mailing at a post office.   ``I did not receive cash but got a case of soap,'' LeeChung-kil, 34, a taxidriver said. ``People say that only foolswould not get gifts. In that sense, I am not a fool.''   A housewife in a relatively wealthy residential area in Seoulsaid it was difficult to reject offers of free lunches or dinners,made through personal friends associated with certain candidates.   ``I had received at least 10 offers of free sumptuous meals. Ihave a guilty feeling for not voting for any of the candidates whoprovided the meals,'' she said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
