Next Thursday, if plans work out, the space shuttle Discovery will roar from its launch pad as a million spectators cheer its rise into orbit. The future of the U.S. space program rides on the flight.    It is the first attempt to put Americans into space in the nearly three years since a shuttle explosion here killed seven astronauts, including a young teacher. Discovery &quot;will restore NASA as an agency that sails on the ocean of space,&quot; says Thomas Paine, once head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.    But another tragedy would doom U.S. manned space exploration. Even a triumphal mission won't resolve fundamental problems dogging the shuttle program.    NASA dreams of exploring the solar system by sending shuttle astronauts to launch giant telescopes, construct a manned space station and fetch satellites. But military and scientific critics complain that the shuttle is too expensive, too fragile and too unreliable for such missions. They want to turn to unmanned spacecraft instead. Even some of NASA's biggest supporters want to reduce shuttle launches to lessen the risk of another crash.    &quot;The nub of the debate is: What do you do with humans in space?&quot; says Richard DalBello, a space analyst for the Office of Technology Assessment, a research arm of Congress. &quot;You don't need the shuttle if manned space isn't important.&quot;    The shuttle's great sophistication -- Russian cosmonauts thud to Earth in charred capsules, while shuttle astronauts glide down in airliner style -- also works against it. The shuttle performs more like a costly Indy 500 race car than the cheap, reliable cargo truck NASA once promised.    At a time of huge budget deficits, shuttle costs keep rising. In the early 1970s, NASA talked about launching a shuttle a week for about $10 million a launch. Now it wants to send up one a month for maybe $300 million a launch. Shuttle travel is so pricey that even an alchemist who could magically turn a cargo of lead into gold in space might lose money, says William Michael, a space expert at the National Academy of Sciences.    &quot;The shuttle was clearly a mistake,&quot; grumbles Sen. William Proxmire, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the subcommittee that handles NASA's budget.    The spacecraft's complexity raises safety questions. A tiny flaw can send complex shuttle machinery hurtling toward disaster. Joseph Lombardo, director of the orbiter's main engines, worries that a small heating-coil leak could shut down the engine or blow it up. In the past year, he says, NASA found two heating-coil leaks during tests, although neither proved disastrous. NASA Administrator James Fletcher frets about the redesigned booster. &quot;It's a more complicated beast than we thought it was,&quot; he says.    There is reason for concern. Already, Discovery's boosters are outfitted with only half the test instruments originally planned because NASA rushed to meet an early launch date, says Myron Uman, director of the National Research Council panel overseeing the booster redesign. NASA will drop most of those sensors after flight three, instead of flight six, he adds, because of budget problems. If NASA successfully launches a few shuttles, pressure will increase to quicken the pace -- and to slide a bit on safety.    NASA must become enormously more efficient, or cut safety margins, or give up on meeting its schedule. In 1985, the year before the Challenger disaster, NASA managed nine shuttle flights by working shuttle crews at the Kennedy Space Center to exhaustion and by recklessly cannibalizing spare parts from sitting shuttles. Now it takes three times as long as it once did to assemble shuttle boosters and refurbish the orbiter. But NASA still hopes to launch seven flights next year, 10 the year after that and, eventually, 14.    NASA managers swear they have learned the lessons of the Challenger disaster and won't scrimp on safety. Hot gases escaping from a faulty solid-rocket booster seal destroyed the shuttle in January 1986. Since then, the agency has redesigned about 500 parts in the orbiter, booster and external fuel tank that constitute the shuttle, and tested the changes thoroughly. NASA even riddled one booster with holes during a test firing to make sure it didn't blow up when damaged.    A successful launch will revive flagging interest in manned space exploration, the space agency hopes. &quot;The public looks at the shuttle as the main event,&quot; asserts NASA's Mr. Fletcher. &quot;They're interested in seeing people in space, not robots.&quot;    Initially, NASA will be content if it can launch its shuttle backlog of Pentagon spy satellites, unmanned planetary spacecraft and occasional commercial satellites without a glitch. But the agency also wants to spend $1.2 billion for a new generation of rocket boosters and about the same to build an unmanned shuttle that can lift three times the load of the current model.    With these improvements, NASA figures it can more easily construct a permanently manned space station and, from there, head out to the moon and Mars.    &quot;NASA will lead the world into a high-tech era of space exploration,&quot; predicts Mr. Paine, the former NASA chief who has mapped out a plan for colonizing Mars.    But some of NASA's most important customers say they don't need a manned space shuttle to work in space, raising the question of exactly what NASA should use the shuttle for. After the Challenger disaster, President Reagan banned the shuttle from carrying communications satellites, hoping to spur the growth of privately owned rocket companies.    Now the Air Force, spooked by NASA's earlier attempts to grab all military payloads for the shuttle, wants to eliminate as many shuttle flights as it can. It is spending lavishly to build a new fleet of unmanned rockets and has indefinitely &quot;mothballed&quot; a shuttle launch site it spent $3.5 billion to build at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.    Space scientists want to be next to dump the shuttle in favor of unmanned launchers. Mr. Fletcher, NASA's chief, concedes that the shuttle has been a disaster for planetary probes because it isn't dependable enough to launch during the brief time periods -- sometimes only a week -- when the planets are properly aligned. An unmanned mission to Jupiter, named Galileo, is 10 years late and $1 billion over cost because of missed launch dates and other shuttle problems.    NASA once planned to equip planetary probes with powerful rockets for interplanetary travel, but after the Challenger disaster NASA discarded the rockets as too dangerous to fly on the shuttle. Galileo's replacement rockets are so underpowered that the Jupiter spacecraft must travel first to Venus and then back to Earth before it can pick up speed to head to Jupiter -- adding four years to the journey.    John Bahcall, an astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., argues that the shuttle also will cripple NASA's plans to launch four big telescopes, called &quot;The Great Observatories,&quot; to plot the birth and evolution of the universe. The first observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope, is already six years late because of shuttle delays. The other three face similar delays unless they fly on unmanned rockets, he says. &quot;The shuttle has set back space science in the U.S. by at least a decade,&quot; he complains.    Mr. Fletcher disagrees. He says the shuttle will be able to rescue the space telescopes should they run into trouble. NASA also plans to send shuttle astronauts to replace aging telescope parts with advanced instruments.    &quot;You can use the shuttle to maintain {the telescopes} for decades, and even improve the electronics,&quot; adds Lennard Fisk, head of NASA's space science division.    The future of the shuttle is tied tightly to whether NASA finds the money to start projects to colonize the moon or Mars, or whether it is forced to settle largely for unmanned ventures. That is a choice NASA has tried to avoid since the moon landings because it fears its budget and its public support will shrivel without astronaut heroics. &quot;NASA has no incentive for soul-searching,&quot; says Walter McDougall, a Pulitzer Prize-winning space historian.    Just how the presidential election will affect the shuttle program isn't clear. Neither of the candidates says what he will do with the shuttle. The program's $3.5 billion-a-year budget will make any efforts to reduce the deficit more difficult, especially when combined with NASA's plans to build a space station.    NASA plans to ask for $7.6 billion for the space station over the next three years as part of a project costing up to $30 billion. NASA plans as many as 20 shuttle launches in the mid-1990s to haul up space station parts and bolt them together. So if the president or Congress should decide to scale back the station to reduce the huge deficit, the need for the shuttle would drop.    Even some NASA supporters urge the space agency to reduce shuttle flights because a fatal accident anytime soon could doom manned exploration. Byron Leonard, an aerospace risk-assessment consultant in El Segundo, Calif., says that NASA should cut its planned flights from 14 a year to seven to stretch out the probable time between crashes. Mr. Leonard estimates that the shuttle has about a 2% to 3% chance of a major failure in flight, but says it is impossible to predict the disasters.    Other NASA boosters say the agency should enhance the shuttle's scientific value rather than promoting it as a cargo vehicle. During the Discovery mission, for instance, the shuttle's five astronauts will concentrate on releasing a NASA communications satellite -- something unmanned rockets have mastered for 25 years.    But the Discovery astronauts will also try to grow protein samples used in AIDS and cancer research that are difficult to make on earth, but which may blossom under near-weightless conditions. &quot;There's a whole host of biological problems that we're approaching with this flight,&quot; says Larry DeLucas, a University of Alabama molecular biologist.    Future shuttle missions could boost scientific research even more. Spacehab Inc., of Washington, D.C., plans to outfit shuttle missions with a lab deck that would increase the number of experiments astronauts could run on the shuttle to 23 from about three. External Tanks Corp. in Boulder, Colo., proposes packing the shuttle's external fuel tank with instruments so it can take atmospheric measurements when it is jettisoned to earth.    Louis Frank, a University of Iowa physicist, sketches even bolder experiments. The shuttle could launch a small scientific satellite and circle around it while zapping it with radio waves, ion beams and electrons to measure the upper atmosphere and predict how satellite communications may be affected by turbulence.    Shuttles could also be modified so astronauts could spend 30 days in orbit, rather than 10, making them guinea pigs for scientists studying the effects of weightlessness. The shuttles then could spend weeks visiting smaller, cheaper space stations that could be built for, say, producing materials. &quot;It would be like a lighthouse tender visiting an automated lighthouse&quot; for servicing, says Mr. Paine, the former NASA administrator.    While these missions wouldn't be as dramatic as manned journeys through the solar system, they could make sensible use of the shuttle while the U.S. decides whether it wants to commit to more grandiose goals. Even some of NASA's sternest critics admit they would like to get to Mars. &quot;It would be fabulous,&quot; says Mr. Bahcall, the astrophysicist. &quot;It would be like building the pyramids -- something to remember.&quot;    ---                  1988-1989 Shuttle Schedule DATE      ORBITER    MISSION 9/29/88   Discovery  Launch NASA tracking satellite 11/17/88  Atlantis   Secret Pentagon mission 2/18/89   Discovery  Launch NASA tracking satellite 4/28/89   Atlantis   Launch spacecraft to Venus 7/1/89    Columbia   Secret Pentagon mission 8/10/89   Discovery  Secret Pentagon mission 10/12/89  Atlantis   Launch spacecraft to Jupiter 11/13/89  Columbia   Launch communications satellite and                      retrieve long-duration exposure                      experiments 12/11/89  Discovery  Secret Pentagon mission 2/1/90    Atlantis   Launch Hubble Space Telescope 3/1/90    Columbia   Study the Supernova through ultraviolet                      and x-ray telescopes 4/5/90    Discovery  Launch Gamma Ray Observatory 5/10/90   Atlantis   Secret Pentagon mission 6/7/90    Columbia   Study effects of weightlessness 7/19/90   Discovery  Strategic Defense Initiative and other                      experiments 9/10/90   Columbia   Strategic Defense Initiative                      experiments 10/5/90   Atlantis   Launch spacecraft to the sun 11/8/90   Discovery  Launch NASA tracking satellite 12/20/90  Columbia   Study effects of sun on earth's                      atmosphere    Source: National Aeronautics and Space Administration</TEXT></DOC>
