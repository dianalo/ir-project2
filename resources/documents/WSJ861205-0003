Richard Colino, Intelsat's director general, and Jose Alegrett, deputy director general for business planning and external relations, separately released statements in which they said they resigned to save Intelsat embarrassment and to free it to focus on the satellite business.    A spokesman for the agency, however, said the executives were fired &quot;immediately and for cause,&quot; but didn't elaborate.    But Intelsat fired them to signal its disapproval and to deny them retirement benefits, the board said. Mr. Colino made his resignation effective Jan. 2, the day he qualified for a pension. Mr. Alegrett made his retirement effective next spring, when he turns 55 and qualifies for early retirement.    As reported, an outside auditors' report said that Messrs. Colino and Alegrett circumvented the legal and financial departments at the agency to push through the payment and preclude any action by Intelsat to recoup the money. The report also said that Mr. Colino instructed Intelsat executives to backdate and rewrite documents pertaining to the payment in order to justify their actions.    The U.S. attorney here is conducting an investigation into the payments.    The $1,350,000 involved the payment related to a planned loan of about $60 million. The outside auditors' report questioned whether the payment should have been made because the loan has never been approved, and whether the payment was greater than authorized for a loan of that size.    One source close to the agency said the board also was told of other alleged irregularities by the two executives. The source said the board was told that Mr. Colino had accepted a $72,000 personal-consulting contract from a European consulting company, even though he was employed full-time at Intelsat.    The source said the board also was told that the executives directed Intelsat to pay a Panamanian company $562,000 for five 20-page political studies that largely &quot;paraphrased background notes from State Department reports -- and old ones at that.&quot; The source said that Intelsat then paid $125,000 for other reports that used the same material, almost word-for-word, and some data collected by Intelsat employees.    Nathan Lewin, an attorney for Mr. Colino, criticized Intelsat for failing to ask him or Mr. Colino to address the board. &quot;Intelsat is an international organization whose conduct couldn't meet minimal (procedural) standards in the U.S.,&quot; he said. Neither Mr. Alegrett nor his attorney could be reached for comment.    Mr. Colino was the first American elected to head a major international telecommunications agency. &quot;It's an international embarrassment,&quot; said a Washington communications lawyer. &quot;It makes us look like the ugly Americans.&quot;    Even so, the effect of his dismissal on telecommunications policy is difficult to gauge. Mr. Colino has effectively resisted efforts by the U.S. to break Intelsat's near monopoly on international telecommunications.    The U.S. may find his successor easier to deal with, but the successor &quot;will be reluctant to make a bold move&quot; because of Intelsat's disarray, said Michael Gardner, a former U.S. telecommunications official. </TEXT></DOC>
