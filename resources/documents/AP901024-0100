Scientists studied cancer deaths between 1968 and 1987 amongpeople younger than age 25 who lived near six nuclear power orreprocessing plants.   The researchers focused on populations living at distances ofless than 3.1 miles, 3.1 to 6.2 miles, 6.2 miles to 8.1 miles, and8.1 miles to 9.9 miles.   Researchers found more deaths from Hodgkin's disease thanexpected, but said the difference was not statisticallysignificant.   The work is reported in Thursday's issue of the British journalNature by researchers at the Gustave Roussy Institute in Villejuif,France.   Previous reports found more leukemia deaths than expected inpeople younger than 25 who lived near the Sellafield nuclearreprocessing plant in England and the Dounreay nuclear complex inScotland.   Those results may be due to higher discharges of radioactivematerial than in France or other factors such as infections, theFrench researchers speculated.   In September, National Cancer Institute researchers said theyfound no extra cancer risk in or near counties with nuclearinstallations in the United States. The study did not assess riskin more limited areas around the plants.</TEXT></DOC>
