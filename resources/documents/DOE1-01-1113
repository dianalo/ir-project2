For this purpose, researchand development has been launched in 1974 while constructing a 1,000KW class binary cycle power plant. Study on various elementary items(heat media, corrosion resistant materials, turbine shaft seal, heatexchanger) has begun in 1979. Four years later, the development of thedown hole pump has been started to utilize weak-artesian well. Problemsto be solved are summarized at economic performance of the plant, temperaturedrop in reservoir and scaling of injection well. Future tasks to be carriedout include the development of cyclic power generation technology usingthe down hole pump, establishment of optimum thermal cycle system andconstruction of a plant conforming to the conditions of geothermal field.(2 figs, 1 photo)</TEXT></DOC>
