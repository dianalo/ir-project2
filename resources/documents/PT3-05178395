In the      exemplary game of Bingo, for instance, light-weight plastic balls, each      marked with a letter and a number, are randomly selected and deposited      into apertures in a console, by which action they are automatically      identified through the breaking of one row and one column infra-red light      beam of a coordinate grid of such beams. Through electronic encoding,      transmitting, receiving, and decoding, the aforesaid letter-number      combination is substantially instantaneously displayed in two places on a      display board or a video monitor. The numbers are continuously selected      and progressively displayed until a round of play has been completed in      accordance with various rules of the game being played. When this occurs,      the display board is cleared and all of the balls are reloaded to begin      the next round of play. The console contains manually operated controls      which affect the game data stored in memory and thus the display board,      also. </PAL></ABST><PARN> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION </PAC><PAR>  This patent application is a continuation-in-part application based upon      Ser. No. 07/603,918 filed Oct. 26, 1990, now abandoned, which is in turn a      continuation-in-part application based upon Ser. No. 07/490,293, filed      Mar. 8, 1990, and which issued Apr. 30, 1991 as U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,157. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  TECHNICAL FIELD </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to an electronic device for the display of      numerical digits which are so arranged as to form letter-number      coordinates such as those used in lottery games such as Bingo, Keno,      Lotto, or the like, and more specifically concerns a system and devices      for the encoding, transmitting, and displaying of not only such coordinate      type data, but also data indicating the sequence in which each number was      selected. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND ART </PAC><PAR>  Various devices have heretofore been used to track and display, often in      row-column coordinate form, certain randomly selected digits, as used in      games such as Bingo, Keno, Lotto, or the like. Typically, in one exemplary      embodiment, an operator makes a random selection of one ping-pong ball      from among a number of similar balls, each one of which has been labeled      with one of the five letters &quot;B,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; &quot;N,&quot; &quot;G,&quot; or &quot;O,&quot; and a number      between one and seventy-five, for example. In some instances, there may be      no display of the selected numbers. In others, signs, lights, and video      devices have been utilized for this purpose. In these situations, the      usual format has consisted of five rows, each identified by a letter,      matrixed with fifteen columns of numbers. Of course, it will be realized      that other formats are equally possible, such as six rows of ten numbers      per row with a middle divider between the third and fourth rows, for      example. Regardless of the display format employed, however, after a      number has been selected, the operator then announces such letter-number      or row-column coordinate audibly, often over a public address system.      Players subsequently use a marker to cover the grid location on a card      which contains such announced coordinate location. </PAR><PAR>  This action continues until one or more players has covered all of the grid      locations in a particular pre-designated pattern, at which time that round      of play is terminated, the winner is awarded a prize, and a new round is      begun. In large halls with many players, the need arises for large and/or      multiple devices capable of continuously displaying in its appropriate      location each row-column or letter-number coordinate pair called, while      simultaneously displaying the same coordinate pair in the sequence in      which it was called relative to other such coordinate pairs. Devices      possessing this capability make possible the playing of at least two such      lottery games simultaneously, one game, such as Bingo, for instance,      depending on the attaining of enough coordinate pair locations to      determine a winner, and another game, such as Keno, for instance,      depending on the attaining of enough numbers in sequence matching those of      the sequential display to determine a winner. </PAR><PAR>  Prior art has included such devices as video cameras focussed on the last      ball called and electronic memory storage for reconstruction of a set of      digits in case of dispute or so-called &quot;late&quot; Bingo, but none of the      previous methods has provided a truly automatic means of registering and      indicating in a continuous fashion each selected coordinate pair      simultaneously with the selection sequence. Cooper, et al, U.S. Pat. No.      4,218,063, teaches a masterboard with apertures and associated      ball-actuated switches. However, ping-pong balls, specifically constructed      to be as light as possible, lack the weight to satisfactorily actuate most      mechanical switches; hence, the need for the present invention which      generates a signal when a ping-pong ball, or any other opaque device,      passes through beams of infra-red light. However, it can be seen that      other methods of entering coordinate pair selection data into the system      can be employed. Alternatively to the use of the ping-pong balls to      automatically operate identifying switches as the selected balls are      placed in apertures containing the switches, an operator can actuate such      identifying switches manually. Such switches can include pluralities of      push-button or toggle type switches, for instance, among others.      Furthermore, a keyboard, such as the type used in conjunction with      computers, could also be used to enter such selection data. </PAR><PAR>  Loyd, Jr., et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,332,389, teaches a last ball display but,      in this device, the game would have to be stopped and the entire sequence      of previously selected numbers stepped through, digit by digit, in order      to see more of a sequence than merely the last ball called. The device of      the present invention provides a display of at least the last fifteen      numbers in the sequence in which they were selected, as well as the      coordinate pair positional display. Of course, more or less numbers than      fifteen could be utilized just as well in such a sequential order display      system. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, it is specifically an object of the present invention to      provide a system and device to aid in the playing of a plurality of      certain popular lottery games, such as Bingo, Keno, Lotto, and the like,      simultaneously. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of the present invention to provide such a multiple      game-playing device which will not only display the selected coordinate      numbers in their assigned lettered rows in the sequence in which they were      selected, but which additionally will provide a separate row to display      the selected numbers solely on the basis of the sequence in which they      were selected. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a multiple      game-playing device which will accept, register, and encode for subsequent      transmission any signal from any of a plurality of switch-type data entry      mechanisms. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of the present invention to provide such a multiple      game-playing device having a transmitting portion which will encode and      transmit this coordinate and sequential data. </PAR><PAR>  It is yet another object of the present invention to provide such a      multiple game-playing device having at least one receiving-displaying      portion, which can possibly be located at relatively great distances from      the transmitting device, to receive, decode, and display such coordinate      and sequential data. </PAR><PAR>  It is still a further object of the present invention to provide such a      multiple game-playing device having a display portion which displays the      desired coordinate and sequential data in such a way as to be easily seen      by the view even though such display portion can be separated from the      viewer by a considerable distance. </PAR><PAR>  Still another object of the present invention is to provide a device where      the display means is a plurality of video monitors that display the row      coordinate data and sequential data in an alpha-numeric or graphical      fashion. </PAR><PAR>  It is also an object of the present invention to provide such a multiple      game-playing device which is able to utilize any or all, separately or      simultaneously, of a plurality of data transmitting methods and/or      protocols. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  Other objects and advantages of the

INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In accordance with various features of the present invention, an electronic      displaying device, together with a data input unit and electronic      circuitry appropriate to the encoding, sending, receiving, decoding, and      displaying of data as used in various games, such as Bingo, Keno, Lotto,      or the like, is provided. This system is particularly designed to automate      and display, in an unequivocal format, the pertinent information of      certain popular lottery type games in such a manner as to allow more than      one of such games to be played simultaneously, and will be described first      in terms of its components and next, in connection with its operation. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment, a transmitting portion of a device constructed      in accordance with various features of the present invention can be      contained in any suitable housing having appropriate accommodations for      the necessary inputs and outputs, such as a computer keyboard and external      power, for example. Data transmission output can be accomplished      wirelessly, as by an antenna, for instance, or through a cable or the      building's electrical wiring, as well as other methods. A plurality of      switches could also be associated with the transmitting portion, as by      mounting thereon, for instance. For convenience, such switches could be      arranged into five rows of fifteen, if desired. In any case, each input      will indicate the letter, number, symbol, or combination imprinted on the      ping-pong ball. </PAR><PAR>  When a ping-pong ball is selected and the appropriate switch is operated      responsively thereto to enter that fact into the transmission portion,      that switch closure signal is encoded into a unique electronic signal code      representative of that switch and the data imprinted on the ping-pong      ball. This encoded electronic signal is sent to a receiver portion of the      present invention operationally associated with a display portion thereof. </PAR><PAR>  The receiver portion receives and decodes the encoded data into signals      that are then displayed to present a graphical or numeric display of the      data on a standard cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD) or      similar video display monitor. </PAR><PAR>  One embodiment of the display portion of the present invention comprises a      preferably rectangular housing means constructed of some strong, rigid      material, having a back cover and a front cover, which cooperatively      enclose a volume. The front cover of this housing is comprised of a      specially marked face plate hingedly attached thereto. </PAR><PAR>  The face plate is made opaque except for fourteen slot-shaped transparent      areas set in blocks of fifteen columns and six rows, two groups of seven      such transparent slots to each block. Each group of seven transparent      slots is arranged in the familiar configuration used by digital displays      comprised of light emitting diodes (LEDs) or liquid crystal displays      (LCDs). Instead of an LED, however, a light bulb, incandescent or      fluorescent, for instance, is mounted behind each transparent slot. When      the light bulbs proximate the appropriate segment areas are energized, a      two digit number can be discerned as a result thereof. </PAR><PAR>  Located within the housing and behind the face plate is an arrangement of      substantially cubical compartments, each of which contains an electronic      component board, with light bulb and socket configurations attached      thereto. Within each of these compartments, which may also be called      cells, a light-tight enclosure is provided around each particular light      bulb and its associated transparent slot. When an electronic signal has      been received, decoded, and sent to the appropriate cell component board      causing a group of bulbs to be energized, the light from the bulbs is      visible through the transparent portions of that area of the face plate,      revealing the seven-segment characters thus outlined by such transparent      portions. </PAR><PAR>  The desired characters to be displayed on the display portion are arranged      in a pattern corresponding to the labeling on the ping-pong balls as has      been previously described. In the exemplary preferred embodiment, the top      five rows are labeled, from top to bottom, &quot;B, I, N, G,&quot; and &quot;O.&quot; Each row      will preferably contain fifteen two-digit numbers, appearing in the      sequence in which they are selected. The B row will contain the numerals      01 to 15 inclusive; the I row will contain the numerals 16 through 30, the      N row, 31 through 45, the G row will have 46 through 60, and the O row, 61      through 75. A sixth row, also comprised of two seven-segment digits in      each of fifteen positions, will allow the last fifteen, for instance,      digital pairs to be displayed in the sequence in which they were selected,      concurrently with that number's display in the row-column positional      display. It will be seen by those skilled in the art that fifteen is an      arbitrary number and the actual number used can be either greater or      smaller. </PAR><PAR>  An alternative embodiment for the display would utilize a standard display      driver that would convert the signals into the signal necessary to operate      a standard video display such as a computer monitor and a compatible video      monitor. Thus the above described data would be displayed on the monitor      screen either graphically or as standard alpha-numeric characters. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment, the display portion is portable and capable of      being suspended or self-supporting. Wheels and/or legs, suspension lugs,      or other devices can be attached thereto. If carrier-current transmission      is utilized, all signal and power input requirements are satisfied when      the power cord is pluggably connected to a standard 115 VAC receptacle      which is powered by the same power line transformer as the transmitter      portion. However, it must be noted that other embodiments could include,      for instance, the use of coaxial cable or any of various types of wireless      transmission schemes for data signal input. </PAR><PAR>  In use, a game operator would utilize a random selection means to select a      ping-pong ball upon which had previously been imprinted a unique      identification means, preferably a letter-number coordinate pair. Having      selected a ball, the operator would enter the identification information      into the device of the present invention, preferably via the previously      described transmission portion. The signal generated thereby would be      encoded and transmitted to a receiving-displaying portion where it would      be decoded and converted into illuminated light bulbs which would display      the number on an appropriate letter row and a non-letter sequential row      simultaneously for reading and reference at any time by the players of the      game or games. Alternatively, the signals would be displayed on the video      display monitor in the appropriate letter row and a non-letter sequential      row simultaneously for reading and reference at any time by the players of      the game or games. Of course, other signals can be generated and other      functions accomplished by attaching other switches and controls. </PAR><PAR>  It will be immediately obvious to those skilled in the art that alternate      embodiments of the present invention are possible. For instance, one such      alternate embodiment could include the marking of the ping-pong balls with      special ink and/or character designs or symbols suitable for reading with      a Magnetic Ink Character Reader or an Optical Character Reader or some      such like device. Data generated by such a device, however, would still      need to be routed to the electronic circuitry for encryption and      transmission in a manner similar to that which will be described in more      detail in subsequent portions of this application. </PAR><PAC>  BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Referring to the drawings, wherein like numerals indicate like components,      a device for the simultaneous playing of a plurality of selected games is      indicated generally at 10. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment, a console 12 is provided which can be similar to      a speaker's podium in appearance and/or construction. The upper surface 13      of console 12, inclined upwardly away from an operator, is perforated by a      plurality of holes 20. The holes 20 are arranged in an exemplary      embodiment in five rows 18, labeled &quot;B,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; &quot;N,&quot; &quot;G,&quot; and &quot;O,&quot; of      fifteen columns 16, numbered from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;15.&quot; Thus, each hole 20 is      uniquely identified by a letter-number coordinate pair, as &quot;B 12,&quot; for      instance. </PAR><PAR>  A plurality of infra-red (IR) emitter-receiver pairs, or sets, is mounted      on the interior walls of the console 12. In a preferred embodiment, there      are twenty IR sets 14, one IR set 14 mounted in line with each one of the      fifteen columns 16 of holes 20, and one set 14 mounted in line with each      one of the five rows 18 of holes 20. Thus, each hole 20 is bisected in the      Cartesian coordinate &quot;X&quot; plane by the light beam 22 of a row IR set 14,      and in the &quot;Y&quot; plane by the beam 23 of a column IR set 14. All of the IR      sets 14 are mounted so that their respective beams lie in two separate      horizontal planes, with the plane of the column beams 23 being vertically      separated from the plane of the row beams 22. Thus, any opaque object,      such as a ball, 19 dropped into one of the holes 20 interrupts two      infra-red light beams 22 and 23, one for a row 18, and one for a column      16, sending an appropriate identification signal to the electronic      circuitry in transmitter 35. </PAR><PAR>  An interior ball retention deck 1 is attached to an interior wall of      console 12 by a hinge 5 and held in playing position by release lever 2. A      grid of horizontal and vertical partitions 3 is attached to the interior      walls of console 12 by a hinge 5 and held suspended flush against the      upper surface of ball holding deck 1. When a ball 19 is dropped, it is      preferably held by partitions 3 and deck 1 in its position until the game      is finished. At that time, an operator can pull release lever 2, allowing      the end of deck 1 proximate lever 2 to drop and release balls 19 through      exit 4. </PAR><PAR>  As can be seen in FIG. 4, each IR light pair 14 of a row 18 is wired to a      specific input terminal of row BCD pulse generator 30 through      detector/latches 39. In like manner, each IR light set 14 of a column 16      is wired to a specific input terminal of column BCD pulse generator 32      through pulse detector/latches 39A. In a preferred embodiment, pulse      generators 30, 32, and latches 39, 39A, are integral parts of transmitter      35, inside console 12. </PAR><PAR>  Pulse generators 30 and 32 generate sequences, or trains, of pulses which      are unique for each input terminal. In this manner, any interruption of an      IR light beam 22 of any IR set 14 of any row 18 will cause the generation      of a pulse train 40 that is uniquely encoded to that particular row 18.      Likewise, any interruption of an IR light beam 23 of any IR set 14 of any      column 16 will cause a pulse train 42, uniquely coded to that particular      column 16, to be generated by the column BCD pulse generator 32. The pulse      trains 40, 42, so generated are routed to a multiplexer 44 for combining      and sequencing into a serial format pulse train 46. Microprocessor 45      times and coordinates the operation of the encoding and transmitting      section, and power supply 47 is a standard state of the art five Volt DC      supply. </PAR><PAR>  After multiplexing at 44, the pulse train 46 is amplified by a conventional      power amplifier 48 and capacitively coupled 50 into the building's AC      supply voltage line in one embodiment, known as carrier-current      transmission. However, it will be seen by those with expertise in the      field that any transmission means could be utilized, including but not      limited to, coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable, laser light, infra-red      light, and/or wireless radio, via any type of modulation desired. </PAR><PAR>  Regardless of the transmission method utilized, the row-column information      corresponding to the interruptions of specific light beams 22, 23, is      encoded in the pulse train 46 in accordance with the chart of FIG. 3.      Referring to FIG. 3, the encoding method used in one embodiment of the      present invention is of the type known as binary coded decimal (BCD) which      uses four positions of Base 2 numerical values to represent sixteen      different four digit numbers, from zero to fifteen. The presence of a one      (represented electronically by a positive voltage pulse) equals the      presence of a value in a particular position. In the decimal (Base 10)      system, a one in the right hand-most place equals the presence of the      value of one (ten to the zero power). In the BCD system, a one in the      right hand-most position also equals a one but it is two to the zero power      in this case. Just as each place progressively to the left in the decimal      system equals ten to an increased power (10 to the first powerandequals;10), (ten      squaredandequals;100, ten cubedandequals;1000, etc.), so each place progressively to the      left in the BCD system equals two to an increased power, i.e., two to the      first powerandequals;two, two squaredandequals;four, two cubedandequals;eight. Thus, the four      positions of a four-digit number would indicate the presence or lack of an      eight, a four, a two, or a one, reading from left to right. </PAR><PAR>  The values represented by the presence of ones (pulses) are added together      to determine the decimal equivalent. Therefore, the value of one is      represented in BCD as 0001, five is represented by the value for four plus      the value for one, as 0101, twelve is 1100 (8andplus;4andplus;0andplus;0), thirteen is 1101,      etc., as illustrated in the chart of FIG. 3. A one in each of the four      positions will be seen to total fifteen. The absence of a pulse (or one),      of course, represents zero. </PAR><PAR>  A modification of the BCD code has been devised which permits converting of      the double digits between ten and fifteen into single digits. This code is      called hexadecimal code. In the hexadecimal code, the letters A through F      represent the digits ten through fifteen, respectively. Conventionally,      hexadecimal coded numbers are prefixed by the dollar sign, $, in notation.      Thus, as utilized by the present invention, the digits one through nine in      the decimal system are the same as $1 (read &quot;hex one&quot; ) through $9 (&quot;hex      nine&quot;) in the hexadecimal system, and are written 0001 through 1001 in      BCD. However, the difference between the two systems, begins with $A (&quot;hex      A&quot;) in hexadecimal, written 1010 in BCD, which is ten in the decimal      system, as illustrated in FIG. 3. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, a &quot;word&quot; of encoded information consists of an      eight-bit &quot;byte,&quot; which is made up of two four-bit &quot;nybbles.&quot; The      left-most four-bit nybble represents a row code, and column codes are      represented by the right-most four-bit nybble. The two nybbles are      separated by a space, or pause in transmission. </PAR><PAR>  Because there are only five rows to be encoded, these five left-most      addresses can be represented by 0001 through 0101 Base 2, leaving the      values eight through twelve (Base 10) (1000 through 1100 Base 2) free to      be used to encode other things, such as signals from control switches on      the console, for instance. Therefore, this has been done for five switches      in the present invention as follows: </PAR><PA1>  1000 xxxxandequals;Cancel Last Entry Switch 26 </PA1><PA1>  1001 xxxxandequals;Reset/Clear Board Switch 28 </PA1><PA1>  1010 xxxxandequals;Replay Sequence/Check Sw. 27 </PA1><PA1>  1011 xxxxandequals;&quot;Next&quot; Switch 29 </PA1><PA1>  1100 xxxxandequals;Cancel Replay/Restore Board Switch 24 </PA1><PAR>  The right-most half 42 of the serial pulse train 46, indicated by &quot;x&quot;s and      separated from the left-most half 40 by a blank position one pulse width      wide, is used to indicate the number (column) address of a selected      coordinate pair. These four positions are created in the same manner as      the first four, except that the pulses filling these positions are      generated by the column generator 32 instead of the row generator 30.      These four pulse positions are used to represent seventy-five numbers by      using each group of fifteen column codes with a different row code. Each      combination, therefore, is made to represent one of five different values,      depending on which row code train is used with it. In this manner, the      same fifteen codes which would equal one (0001) to fifteen (1111) when      used with a &quot;B&quot; row code (0001), would equal sixty-one to seventy-five      when used with an &quot;O&quot; row code (0101). Thus, 0001 1111 would equal B 15,      and 0101 1111 would equal O 75. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 5, the combined serial pulse train 46 is shown being received by      receiver 52. After this pulse train has been demultiplexed at 60, row      pulse train 40 and column pulse train 42 are fed to the microprocessor 68      for processing, storage in Random Access Memory (RAM) 70, and then on to      the decoding section in FIG. 6. The pulse train data entered into      microprocessor 68 is sent to RAM 70 and stored so that if a power failure      should occur, microprocessor 68 and the &quot;keep-alive&quot; battery 84 will      ensure that the data in RAM 70 is saved. After power has been restored,      &quot;Cancel Replay/Restore Board&quot; switch 24 on the console 12 can be activated      to send the &quot;restore&quot; pulse train signal to the microprocessor 68 so it      will return the display board 80 to the status existing at the time of the      power outage. Read Only Memory (ROM) 58 contains the previously stored      program of commands which controls the actions of microprocessor 68. Power      supply 54 supplies the five Volts DC for the entire display board 80, and      also all the 115 Volts AC, which is switched by an internal relay, not      shown. Power for display board 80 is supplied through the power on/off      switch 49. In FIG. 6, row pulse train 40 and column pulse train 42, after      having passed through the microprocessor 68, are routed to row decoder 62      and column decoder 64, respectively. Block diagrams of these circuits are      shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, and a more detailed explanation of their      operation follows later. </PAR><PAR>  In the decoding section shown in FIG. 6, the pulse trains are translated in      row decoder 62 and column decoder 64 into single pulses on the output      lines appropriate to the input signal. For instance, &quot;N 43&quot; would become a      pulse on the &quot;N&quot; output line of the row decoder 62, and a pulse on the      &quot;$D&quot; output line of column decoder 64. The outputs of both of these      decoders go to the left- and right-hand digit decoders, 56 and 57,      respectively. In addition, parallel outputs from row decoder 62 are routed      to the appropriate digit illumination boards 90x as row selector signals.      Row combiner gate 41 is an OR gate which provides a row select signal to      the sequential display &quot;S&quot; row digit illumination boards 90S no matter      which of the other rows is selected. </PAR><PAR>  The eight output lines corresponding to the numerals zero through seven      from left-hand digit decoder 56 carry signals to the left-hand segment      decoder 61. Similarly, the ten output lines corresponding to the numerals      zero through nine from the right-decoder 57 carry signals to the      right-hand segment decoder 63. To continue the use of the analogy &quot;N 43,&quot;      a pulse would be present on the &quot;4&quot; line of the left-hand digit decoder      56, and on the &quot;3&quot; line of right-hand digit decoder 57, as well as on the      &quot;N&quot; line of row decoder 62. The segment decoders, 61, 63, convert input      pulses into pulses on the output lines to cause the illumination of the      correct segments of a standard seven segment display, as illustrated in      FIG. 2. The output of the left-hand segment decoder 61 would be a pulse on      each of the &quot;b,&quot; &quot;c,&quot; &quot;f,&quot; and &quot;g&quot; segment lines for a &quot;4,&quot; and a pulse on      each of the &quot;a,&quot; &quot;b,&quot; &quot;c,&quot; &quot;d,&quot; and &quot;g&quot; lines of the right-hand segment      decoder 63 for a &quot;3.&quot; </PAR><PAR>  The row signal from row decoder 62, the signal from row combiner gate 41 to      the &quot;S&quot; row, the pulses on the appropriate output lines of segment      decoders 61 and 63, are all routed to the digit illumination board 90x, in      the display section, illustrated in FIG. 7. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 7, the row select signal for the &quot;N&quot; row is shown being      applied to the row name illumination circuit 73N. This lights the bulb      behind the letter &quot;N&quot; of that row on display board 80. A detailed view of      the row name illumination circuit is shown in FIG. 12 and a more detailed      explanation of that circuit's operation follows later. The row select      signal is also conducted to each of the 30 digit illumination boards 90x      on each row. In FIG. 7, only eight representative boards of one row are      shown for reasons of space. Because every seven segment digit used      requires either the segment &quot;b&quot; or the segment &quot;c&quot; in its structure, the      &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; segment decoder output lines are also wired to the column      incremented 71x on each row. Thus, after a number has been entered in a      particular column of a particular row, each new number to be displayed on      that row is moved to the next column to the right through the use of the      &quot;b&quot; or &quot;c&quot; segment pulse as an indication of the presence of a new digit.      A block diagram of the column incremented 71 is shown in FIG. 11 and a      more detailed explanation of this circuit follows later. </PAR><PAR>  A block diagram of the digit illumination circuit board 90x is shown in      FIG. 8. The 115 Volts AC potential is wired to each of the silicon      controlled rectifiers (SCR) 31 which are essentially open circuits until      biased into conduction by pulses on their gate electrodes. Pulses on the      segment decoders 61, 63 are applied to one input leg of AND gates 33x. The      other input leg of each gate 33x is tied in common to the output of column      incremented 71x for that row. Thus, each gate 33x with a pulse on both a      segment input leg and the column incremented input leg will be enabled,      passing a pulse to the gate electrode of matching SCR 31x. For the digit      &quot;4,&quot; gates 33b, 33c, 33f, and 33g are enabled, as are SCRs 31b, 31c, 31f,      and 31g. This action allows the AC voltage to be applied to bulbs 21b,      21c, 21f, and 21g. The pulse on the column incremented input line also      energizes column select SCR 43x, closing one more link in the circuit. The      row select signal pulse will energize the row select SCR 38x of all the      digit illumination boards 90x of the selected row only, finally completing      the circuit from common ground return to the AC voltage through the      selected light bulbs, causing them to be illuminated. Once an SCR has been      energized, it will remain so energized until the AC voltage is removed,      thus holding all previously illuminated numeral segments in the On      position. The AC voltage is normally not removed until the display board      80 is completely reset by the operator. The AND gates 33x on the segment      input lines are to prevent the most recent segment signals present on the      lines from changing the configuration established by a preceding digit. </PAR><PAR>  Simultaneously with the illuminating of the light bulbs on a coordinate      position row, the same row select signal is fed from row combiner gate 41      to the SCR 38S on each of the digit illumination boards 90S of the &quot;S,&quot;      sequential, row. In this manner, any selected number is displayed in both      its coordinate (86) and its sequential (82) positions, simultaneously.      Thus, one look at the display board 80 tells the viewer which row-number      pairs (section 86) have been called out by the operator, and the sequence      (section 82) in which they were called. Of course, the selection sequence      within each row is obviously left to right. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 9 for a more detailed explanation of the operation of      left-hand digit decoder 56, it can be seen that the presence of a pulse on      any one of the fifteen output lines from the column decoder 64 is passed      through the particular OR gate 79x to which that line is connected. For      instance, a pulse on any of the lines $A through $F would pass through OR      gate 79F to one input leg of AND gate 81G. The other required input to AND      gate 81G is from the &quot;N&quot; output line of the Row Decoder 62. Thus, an &quot;N&quot;      pulse and a $D pulse would result in an output pulse from AND gate 81G      which would go through OR gate 87C to the left-hand segment decoder 61 to      generate the digit &quot;4&quot; for display as the left-hand digit 88 for game      numbers in the forties. The &quot;N&quot; signal is also used in AND gate 81F to      create a &quot;3&quot; digit for game numbers in the thirties. </PAR><PAR>  The generation of the remaining digits used in the left-hand digit location      88 is accomplished in a similar manner. In the embodiment described and      illustrated, only the digits &quot;0&quot; through &quot;7&quot; are utilized in the left      digit 88 because the exemplary game being described only uses the numbers      one through seventy-five. Obviously, other formats and embodiments can be      utilized within the concept and scope of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  The operation of the right-hand digit decoder circuit is best explained      with reference to FIG. 10. The right-hand digit 89 uses all ten of the      conventional numerals zero through nine. FIG. 10 is a block diagram of the      circuit in which signals from the row and column decoders are transformed      into the right-hand digit 89 of the two-digit display. A &quot;B&quot; or an &quot;N&quot; or      an &quot;O&quot; signal from Row Decoder 62 is sent through OR gate 59 to one of the      input pins on each of ten AND gates 53A through 53J, as identified by the      Boolean algebra notation Bandplus;Nandplus;O, which is read &quot;B or N or O.&quot; Boolean      algebra notation utilizes the mathematical symbols for addition to      represent a logic OR function and the symbols for multiplication to      represent a logic AND. A signal on either the &quot;I&quot; or the &quot;G&quot; line goes      from OR gate 55 to the remaining ten AND gates 15A-J. </PAR><PAR>  The process of deriving the digit &quot;3&quot; of &quot;N 43&quot; for display in the right      side half 89 of the two-digit display in any of the fifteen columns is      typical of the manner in which the other nine right digits is derived. At      AND gate 53C, the signal Bandplus;Nandplus;0 and $D, from the $3andplus;$D OR gate, together      create an output signal pulse which passes through OR gate 51C to cause      segment decoder 63 to activate the segment lines appropriate for the digit      &quot;3.&quot; For a row signal of &quot;B or N or 0,&quot; the output digit would be the 3 of      03, 13, 33, 43, 63, or 73. For a row signal of &quot;I&quot; or &quot;G,&quot; the output      digit would be the 3 or 23 or 53. Similarly, the signals $7 and I or G      produce the 2 for 22 or 52, while either $2 or $C, together with that for      a B or N or O generates the 2 for 02, 12, 32, 42, or 72. </PAR><PAR>  The column incremented circuit can best be explained with reference to the      block diagram of FIG. 11, wherein it will be seen that the &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;      segment signals are applied to the digit detector OR gate 65. Because      either a &quot;b&quot; or a &quot;c&quot; segment is common to every seven segment digit, the      presence of one of these pulses indicates the presence of a digit to be      displayed. When a pulse is present on one of the input legs of OR gate 65      for a particular row, then an output pulse is generated, which is applied      to an input of AND gate 17. When a row select pulse from row decoder 62 is      present on the other input leg of AND gate 17, an output pulse is      generated by that device, likewise. Thus, it can be seen that both a row      select signal and a digit present signal are required to generate an      output pulse from AND gate 17. When both of these signals are input to AND      gate 17, that gate will send an output pulse to the CLOCK input of &quot;D&quot;      type flip-flop 67. Because DC is wired to the D input of flip-flop 67,      every output pulse of gate 17 will &quot;clock&quot; this &quot;high&quot; logic level to the      Q output. The Q output signal goes to one input of all the AND gates 85x      and to shift register 69. Thus, the first Q output pulse enables the AND      gates and generates an output on the &quot;1&quot; line of the shift register which      goes to the other input of AND gate 85A. With a signal on both inputs,      this gate is enabled and passes a pulse out to the column select SCR of      the digit illumination board 90x. The next segment pulse arriving at the      column incremented board would enable the &quot;2&quot; line, along with gate 85B.      Thus, each column board is turned On with a particular configuration and      left, with the output selector incrementing to the next position. The      circuit can be set so that, after the fifteenth column has been activated,      changes to the display can be made to cease until the board is reset, or      to start over again at the first column with the sixteenth number. </PAR><PAR>  If the latter method is preferred, the last fifteen numbers called by the      game operator will be displayed in a continuously updated fashion at all      times, the latest one called replacing the number previously displayed in      the left-hand most column, with all the other displayed digits moving one      place to the right. </PAR><PAR>  The block diagram for row name light illumination circuit 73x is shown in      FIG. 12. The 115 Volts AC potential is present at the point indicated when      power switch 49 is turned On. SCR 37x is fired by the presence on its gate      electrode of the appropriate row select pulse from row decoder 62 or row      combiner gate 41. When SCR 37x is fired once, bulb 36x, behind the      transparent outline section of the face plate, will illuminate and remain      so until the circuit is reset. </PAR><PAR>  In an alternative embodiment, the row coordinate data and sequential data      are displayed on video monitor 120. In FIG. 14, the combined serial pulse      train 46 is shown being received by receiver 52. After this pulse train      has been demultiplexed at 60, row pulse train 40 and column pulse train 42      are fed to the microprocessor 68 for processing, storage in Random Access      Memory (RAM) 70, and then on to video driver 130. The pulse train data      entered into microprocessor 68 is sent to RAM 70 and stored so that if a      power failure should occur, microprocessor 68 and the &quot;keep-alive&quot; battery      84 will ensure that the data in RAM 70 is saved. After power has been      restored, &quot;Cancel Replay/Restore Board&quot; switch 24 on the console 12 can be      activated to send the &quot;restore&quot; pulse train signal to the microprocessor      68 so it will return the video display 120 to the status existing at the      time of the power outage. Read Only Memory (ROM) 58 contains the      previously stored program of commands which controls the actions of      microprocessor 68. Power supply 54 supplies the five Volts DC for the      entire video display 120, and also all the 115 Volts AC, which is switched      by an internal relay, not shown. Power for video display 120 is supplied      through the power on/off switch 49. </PAR><PAR>  The pulse train data that are entered into microprocessor 68 are converted      back into the corresponding row coordinate data which is then fed into an      appropriate video driver 130. Video driver 130 is preferably a video      graphics array (VGA) card which in turn processes the data into a      graphical representation of the row coordinate and sequential data which      is displayed on a compatible VGA monitor. It will be of course understood      that any available graphics adapter such as a Hercules graphics adapter      (HGA), Hercules color graphics adapter (HCGA), color graphics adapter      (CGA), enhanced graphics adapter (EGA) or their equivalents or any later      generation graphics adapter coupled with a compatible video monitor will      be suitable. </PAR><PAR>  Simultaneously with graphical presentation of the coordinate position row,      the selected number is displayed in both its coordinate (86') and its      sequential (82') positions, simultaneously. Thus, one look at video      display 120 tells the viewer which row-number pairs (section 86') have      been called out by the operator, and the sequence (section 82') in which      they were called. Of course, the selection sequence within each row is      obviously left to right. </PAR><PAR>  In order to successfully operate the game displaying device, several      manually operated switches have been provided. In a preferred embodiment,      six switches are installed on the console 12 and one on the receiver 52.      Switch 25 on the console 12 and switch 49 on the receiver 52 are Power      On/Off switches for their respective locations. </PAR><PAR>  Switch 26 on the console 12 is the Cancel Last Entry switch, by means of      which an inadvertent entry, such as a ball dropped in the wrong hole, for      instance, can be erased. Switch 27 is the Replay Sequence/Check Switch by      means of which all claims or misunderstandings can be settled. Turning      this switch to the On position suspends regular play by switching the      microprocessor into a reverse, one-step-at-a-time mode. While in this      mode, each number previously entered will be displayed in reverse sequence      by operating the Next switch 29 to step from one number to the next. At      the conclusion of this check, or following any power outage, the Cancel      Replay/Restore Board switch 24 is used to restore the display board 80 or      video display 120 to the configuration it was in at the time of the      interruption, and reinitiate play. The Reset/Clear Board switch 28 is used      to restore all circuits to zero and begin a new round of play. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, from the foregoing detailed description, it will be recognized that a      device for playing a plurality of games simultaneously has been provided. </PAR><PAR>  While a preferred embodiment of a device constructed in accordance with      various features of the present invention has been described herein, it      will be understood that no attempt has been made to limit the device to      such description.
