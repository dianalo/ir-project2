TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israeli analysts said Friday the apparentwillingness of pro-Iranian kidnappers to suspend threats and starttalking has vindicated Israel's decision to abduct a Shiite Moslemcleric.   They say creating movement on the hostage issue is anachievement, even though there is no guarantee negotiations willstart in earnest or result in freeing either Israeli soldiers orWestern hostages.   The Israelis have offered to trade Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid forthree of their soldiers held prisoner in Lebanon and the 16 Westernhostages, who include eight Americans. Obeid is a spiritual leaderof Hezbollah, a Shiite group believed responsible for kidnappingsof foreigners.   ``Israel put the issue of hostages back on the internationalagenda,'' said Shlomo Avineri, a former director-general of theForeign Ministry.   Until the current crisis, ``the West accepted people beingcaptured by bandits and had come to believe nothing could be doneabout it,'' he said in an interview.   Shlomo Gazit, a former chief of military intelligence, said theabduction was a catalyst for a new willingness by Hezbollah totrade hostages. Without it, ``nothing would have happened and allthe existing hostages would be in the same hopeless situation asbefore,'' he said.   Gazit said it also ``put the Israeli hostages on the agenda, andthat was the exact purpose.''   Zeev Schiff, a leading military commentator, was among the fewpublic critics. Writing in the liberal daily Haaretz on Friday, hecalled the abduction a policy of ``restrained lunacy,'' but addedthat it might help deter future acts of terror.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin authorized the July 28 abductionby Israeli commandos after coming under intense pressure to get theIsraeli soldiers home.   Dore Gold of Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for StrategicStudies, said there was a special sensitivity in Israel about notabandoning soldiers in the field.   Failure to act, he said, ``would have a very deleterious effecton the morale of the army when it goes into battle. So that leavesan activist policy as the only choice after efforts to arrangenegotiations failed.''   ``Sometimes there is a misunderstanding why Israel is not moreaggressive in offering peace,'' he said, adding that the week'sevents ``show that the Middle East is a violent region ... and youhave to understand Israel's caution.''   Obeid's abduction brought criticism from the United States,especially after the captors of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, a U.S.Marine kidnapped while on U.N. duty, said Monday they had hangedhim in retaliation. They released a videotape of a man who appearedto be Higgins on a gallows.   Some critics said Israel had failed to consider the effect ofits actions on American hostages, even though Israeli officials andsome other reports say Higgins was killed several months ago.   Such attacks caused concern in Israel, which depends onWashington for $3 billion a year in economic and military aid, butAvi Pazner, chief spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, saidthere was no lasting damage.   ``The attempt by Hezbollah to drive a wedge between Israel andthe United States failed,'' Pazner said. ``All and all, we arepleased to see our standing in public opinion is very high on thisissue. This is very gratifying.''   Israel may not be out of the woods, however. Some analystsbelieve the final evaluation of Israel's actions will depend on theresults of negotiations.   Avineri, of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said the action``will be judged by its outcome. If the outcome is horrible andhostages are killed, Israel will be condemned. If some or all thehostages are freed, no one will split hairs about marginalmistakes.''   How far Israel will go in meeting Shiite demands for release ofan unspecified number of Palestinians remains a question. About8,000 Palestinians have been jailed since an uprising againstIsraeli occupation began 20 months ago in the West Bank and GazaStrip.   Officials are likely to oppose allowing hard-core activists andconvicted killers to return to the occupied lands, which happenedafter 1,050 Arabs were traded in May 1985 for three soldiers heldby a radical Palestinian group led by Ahmed Jibril.   Moshe Nativ, a retired general who helped negotiate thatexchange, said on army radio Obeid was the strongest card forgetting hostages out of Lebanon. In 1985, he noted, there was nomovement in negotiations ``until we kidnapped (Jibril's) nephew.''</TEXT></DOC>
