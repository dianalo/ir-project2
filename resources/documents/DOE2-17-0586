These experiments provide atest of the principle of equivalence in the quantum limit. High precisiondata (1 part in 1000) is presented. The frequency of the quantum interferenceoscillations, and the loss of contrast observed as a function of increasinggravitational potential energy difference are compared with the recentinterferometer dynamical diffraction calculations of Bonse and Wroblewskiand of Horne. Theory and experiment are found to differ by 0.8%.</TEXT></DOC>
