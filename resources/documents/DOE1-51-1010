<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-51-1010 </DOCNO><TEXT>The invention concerns a device for adapting pulse-forming networks tothe requirements of the excitation circuit of a TE high energy lasersystem, which works with excitation by homogeneous, non-arcing condenserdischarges in the gas space of a laser chamber between at least two spacedopposed laser electrodes. In a pulse-forming network (PFN) in a Bluemleincircuit, of the coatings of the first and second foil capacitors, atleast the coating of the second foil capacitors, at least the coatingof the second foil capacitor connected to the laser electrode is dividedinto n part coatings with n=1 gaps, and adjacent part coating are connectedby inductive coupling: this division is also carried out in the pulse-formingnetwork (PFN) in a charge transfer circuit, ie for coatings of the firstand second foil capacitor at least for a part surface of the coatingsof the first and second foil capacitor jointly connected to the laserelectrode.</TEXT></DOC>
