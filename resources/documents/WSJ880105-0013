Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CANDA JAPAN FREST EUROP </CO><IN> PCS FRX MON CMD </IN><TEXT>   Major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, opened the new year with guns blazing in their campaign to defend the dollar, spurring a sharp rally in the U.S. currency.    The dollar initially fell to new post-1940s lows in early Asian trading. But it snapped back to climb 1.6% against the Japanese yen and 1.1% against the West German mark. Its rise was spurred by reports of continued central bank buying of dollars, led by the Bank of Japan in Tokyo trading.    The dollar continued to rise Tuesday in early trading in Tokyo. The dollar opened at 123.00 yen and was quoted at 124.00 yen in late morning trading. The dollar stood at 121.65 yen at the end of trading Monday.    Although the intervention clearly helped the dollar Monday, it did little to change the bearish long-term market sentiment on the currency, traders said.    &quot;I don't think anyone believes anything fundamental has changed&quot; to benefit the dollar, John J. McCarthy, vice president, foreign exchange, at Irving Trust Co., New York, said. But he said the central banks apparently succeeded in turning the currency around, if only for the short term.    &quot;The results are there. It's forcing (traders) to pause&quot; over the idea of selling dollars, he said.    The dollar was quoted at 122.98 yen in late New York trading, compared with 121.10 late Thursday. Markets were closed Friday for New Year's Day. The dollar also jumped to 1.5880 marks from 1.5705. The British pound fell to $1.8745 from $1.8870.    At the start of Asian trading yesterday, the dollar slumped to 120.25 yen and 1.5630 marks, its lowest levels since the modern exchange-rate system was set up in the late 1940s.    The Bank of Japan then entered the Tokyo market with a reported volley of buy orders that sent the dollar soaring. Traders estimated that the Japanese central bank purchased as much as $1 billion in Tokyo trading.    The scene was played again in European trading. The West German Bundesbank bought $25.6 million at the Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing, and dealers said the central bank purchased several times that amount in the open market. The Swiss National Bank in Zurich confirmed that it also intervened to buy dollars.    In New York trading, the Fed reportedly placed buy orders for dollars with several banks. By midday in New York, the dollar was at its intraday high of 123.25 yen, 2.5% above its low for the day.    Total dollar purchases by central banks world-wide yesterday may have exceeded $1.75 billion, according to estimates by some traders.    Yesterday's activity seemed to show increased determination by central banks to stop the dollar's long decline that steepened late last month, dealers said.    &quot;The central banks in general and the Fed in particular were more aggressive than they've been in the past. It shows that there's a little bit more resolve from their standpoint,&quot; Mr. McCarthy of Irving Trust said.    The effect of the intervention was enhanced by some traders' hesitancy to sell dollars aggressively after the currency's year-end plunge.    &quot;We're getting a little scared of being close to the bottom&quot; of the dollar's decline, John W. Baker, vice president and chief foreign exchange trader for Bank Julius Baer andamp; Co. in New York, said. In intervening aggressively yesterday, he said, the central banks were &quot;playing around with (traders') feelings.&quot; He added, &quot;The market's nervous.&quot;    Reported remarks by French Economics Minister Edouard Balladur didn't soothe anxiety in the currency markets yesterday. In an interview with a French newspaper, Mr. Balladur said the Dec. 23 reaffirmation of an international agreement to stabilize exchange rates contained a secret clause regarding coordinated market intervention. He didn't elaborate.    In Washington, a Treasury spokesman declined to comment on the report.    The initial stabilization agreement --signed by the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, Italy, Canada and France --was credited with keeping the dollar relatively steady for several months last year.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $8.10 an ounce to $478.10 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.3 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $479.71 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                  Late New York Trading -                  Monday, Jan. 4, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
