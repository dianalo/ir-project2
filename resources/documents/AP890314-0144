(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A forecast Tuesday of warmer weather thrustthis western Massachusetts college town into preparations for anannual rite of spring, the migration of spotted salamanders across aroad.   Several Massachusetts communities annually divert traffic so thesalamanders can get to their breeding pools without getting squishedby passing cars. But Amherst has embraced the six-inch amphibianswith special enthusiasm.   Last year, more than 200 vounteer salamander herders, about equalthe number of salamanders, turned out for the soggy march that marksthe first rainy spring night when temperatures climb over 40 degrees.   Typically the salamanders ease out of their winter burrowsbetween mid-March and mid-April. With temperatures forecast to reach50 to 60 degrees in the next few days, the town is getting ready.   Robert Winston, an amateur naturalist who has been helping thesalamanders across the road for more than 12 years, has assembledvolunteer work crews to clear winter debris from the tunnelsconstructed for the salamanders.   Based on similar culverts used in Britain for migrating toads,the tunnels are 18 inches wide, six inches high and topped withgrates. Winston said most of the salamanders used the tunnels aftermesh fences were installed to guide them to the openings last spring.   To protect strays who head for the roads, crews erect``Salamander Crossing'' signs designed by schoolchildren.   ``It's great. It's nature at its best,'' said Stanley Ziomek,town public works superintendent, who admits to having a soft spotfor the navy blue amphibians with yellow polka dots.   The state also is stepping up efforts to protect the salamanderbreeding grounds with a certification program that would make atleast some of the vernal pools eligible for protection fromdevelopment, said Peter Mireck of the state Division of Fisheriesand Wildlife.   The pools, which are filled only during the wet seasons, arecrucial to many species, including salamanders and spring peepers,which need a breeding place where their eggs won't be eaten by fish,Mireck said.   Both Mireck and Betsy Colburne of the Massachusetts AudubonSociety said they were hard pressed to account for the state'sfascination with salamanders, but Mireck described their annualmigration as ``a harbinger of spring, almost like the robins.''   ``And they are very beautiful,'' the biologist maintained.</TEXT></DOC>
