The 100-square-mile area of smooth, uninterrupted surface, whereeven jet-powered cars can run flat out for miles, has beenshrinking 1 percent a year for 28 years, said U.S. Bureau of LandManagement District Manager Deane Zeller.   ``Given this long-term trend, it's apparent that the Salt Flats,as we know them today, are in trouble. Clearly, some hard questionsneed to be addressed,'' he said in a statement Monday.   The BLM is asking state agencies, the U.S. Geological Survey,racing interests and a potash company to join in a three-year,$330,000 study of what can be done.   Zeller said that while other salt flats exist in Australia andAfrica, none are of the quality and accessibility of the BonnevilleSalt Flats.   The BLM has the backing of the Southern California TimingAssociation for the study. The group, organizer of the largest ofthe annual speed trials held on the salt, has complained for yearsabout deterioration of the racing surface.   Many suspect a Wendover company's practice of draining brinefrom land adjacent to the flats to recover potash.   But Reilly Chemical Co. denies responsibility for anydeterioration and maintains there is no hard evidence of an overallsalt loss.</TEXT></DOC>
