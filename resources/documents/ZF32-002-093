(TechTalk) (Column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Gibson, Steve.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The hardware-interrupt system in IBM-compatible microcomputers isthe cause of most system 'hangs,' and preemptive multitasking cancause additional failures if the software is not very carefullywritten.andP;  A non-preemptive multitasking system gives exclusivecontrol to one task until the user explicitly releases controlback to the system's task scheduler; preemptive multitaskingrequires tasks to be more careful as they manipulate the systembecause they could be 'outranked' by another task at any moment.andO;Authoring software for preemptive multitasking environmentsrequires programmers to be very alert, questioning systemstability throughout program execution and taking responsibilityfor the consequences of any preemption.andP;  MS-DOS is an aging,single-tasking operating system, but hardware interruptions giveit all of the dangers of preemptive multitasking.andP;  DOS can be astricky to program for as any other system for this reason.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     MultitaskingProgram Development TechniquesSoftware DesignCache memory.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
