The face-to-face talks, which broke off Nov. 4, were set for1:30 p.m. at Hammond's offices.   Meanwhile, the union representing engineering workers for Boeingagreed Friday to extend its present labor contracts beyond theirDec. 1 expiration dates while negotiations continue.   The contracts cover nearly 28,000 workers, who are representedby the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association.   Agreement on the engineers' and professional workers' pacts,however, is not expected until there is a settlement in theMachinists' strike.   While both Boeing and the Machinists welcomed new talks, theunion warned ``continued stonewalling by the company would lead toa continuation of the seven-week-old strike.''   The previous talks broke off after union leaders rejected aBoeing offer that had a new look but the company conceded includedno new money. The union accused Boeing of trying to build upworkers' hopes, then forcing a membership vote.   Boeing spokesman Harold Carr declined to say whether there wasany change in either side's position.   ``Our objective all along has been to get the 57,000 Boeingemployees back to work and the fact the meeting is called ishopefully a sign that we can get them back to work,'' he said.   The strike, which began Oct. 4, on Saturday it becomes thesecond-longest strike in Boeing's history, surpassing a 1977 workaction that lasted 45 days. The longest, in 1948, lasted 140 days.   The latest three-year offer from Boeing included annual wageincreases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent; annual bonuses of10 percent of gross pay, 4 percent and 4 percent; a reduction inmandatory overtime from the current 200 hours a quarter to 144hours by mid-1990, and across-the-board increases in retirementbenefits.   Machinists represent 57,000 Boeing workers, including 43,000 inthe Seattle area, 12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore.,and a few hundred others at scattered sites in other states.   Work on production lines has been severely curtailed by thestrike, though Boeing has said it is continuing with help ofsupervisory personnel and a few thousand machinists who crossedpicket lines.</TEXT></DOC>
