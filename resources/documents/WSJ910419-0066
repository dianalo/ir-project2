A U.S. official says there have been &quot;some substantivecommunications&quot; with Tehran through Swiss channels on refugeerelief and Persian Gulf security. American officials stressthat the swift troop withdrawal should ease Iranian fearsabout U.S. intentions in the region. But officials so far aredisappointed by Iran's response.</LP><TEXT>   Iran has begun claiming it has no influence with thehostage-holders in Lebanon -- and has reiterated itsinsistence that a small group of Iranians captured years agoin Lebanon be accounted for at the same time as Westernhostages. The U.S. has long believed the Iranians were killedby a Lebanese faction and sees Tehran's raising of the issueas a red herring.   U.S. officials say at least they don't see any signs ofnew Iranian-inspired terrorism.                                                                                                          THE FED PLANS to hold rates steady unless economic newsworsens.   Anti-inflation &quot;hawks&quot; feel they have the upper hand: Thefinancial markets' favorable response to the Fed's inactionstrengthens the case for doing nothing. But officials seekinganother modest cut in rates to assure a stronger recoverycontinue to seek an opening. The recent slowdown inmoney-supply growth could provide such an opportunity if itisn't a fluke.   Partly because of stories about internal tension at theFed, the administration backs off its public criticism. Bradyand White House economist Boskin shift the focus of theircomplaints to Germany's tight-money policies. But frictionpoints remain: Greenspan is expected soon to oppose anadministration scheme to borrow from the Fed to bolster thebank insurance fund.                                                                                                          MOYNIHAN SEEKS a symbolic victory for his payroll tax cut.   The New York lawmaker hopes to score a largely rhetoricalwin as early as next week by amending the Senate's budgetresolution to open the way for a vote on the Social Securitytax cut later this year. &quot;We can pass it by a majority voteeasily,&quot; predicts Sen. Hollings, a supporter.   But opposition to the tax cut grows on both sides of theaisle. Senate Finance Chairman Bentsen takes a firm standagainst his fellow Democrat's provision, as do influentialRepublicans Gramm and Domenici. The American Association ofRetired Persons, the powerful senior-citizens lobby, alsocomes out in opposition.   &quot;The momentum is going the opposite way for him,&quot; Domenicisays of Moynihan.                                                                                                          BAKER HINTS that his current Mideast trip could turn intoa shuttle, trying to push Arabs and Israelis toward aregional peace meeting. His schedule takes him through &quot;atleast Tuesday,&quot; he says. Israeli officials offer journaliststraveling with him press passes valid for two months.                                                                                                          WAKE-UP CALL? Republicans and Democrats alike complainthat the administration lets its bank-reform plan languish.&quot;At some time, I'd like the administration's support for itsown bill,&quot; says GOP Sen. Garn. In a letter, House DemocratsBarnard and Schumer urge Bush &quot;to take a more active andpersonal role&quot; in pushing his bill.                                                                                                          THE FTC TARGETS the $32 billion weight-control industry.It currently is investigating 13 diet programs -- anddemanding that the chains substantiate their heavilyadvertised claims about weight loss and safety. The agencyalso investigates the claims of 11 manufacturers anddistributors of diet pills and food supplements.                                                                                                          HEADING FOR THE EXITS: With the arrival of lightlyregarded new drug czar Martinez, predecessor Bennett's topaides start to melt away. Deputy chief of staff David Tellbecomes Republican National Committee research chief; formerBennett assistant Chuck Wexler moves to another White Houseanti-drug program.                                                                                                          THE PARTIES SCRAMBLE to line up strong candidates for '92Senate races.   Democratic operatives strongly urge Rep. Stallings tochallenge Symms in Idaho. They tout Oklahoma state Sen.Darryl Roberts, who is part Indian, against Nickles, Rep.DeFazio in Oregon against Packwood and Rep. Moody againstWisconsin's Kasten. But they worry that their own incumbent,Adams, is so weak he may draw a primary challenge inWashington.   For Republicans, chairman Gramm of their Senate campaigncommittee plans a recruiting trip to Colorado and Nevadaearly next month to seek candidates against Wirth and Reid;in Colorado, he hopes to snag politically active businessmanTerry Considine. In North Carolina, former Reps. Cobey andJohnston consider challenging Sanford, but Helms is pushingbusinessman Lauch Faircloth, a recent convert to the GOP.   Of the two Keating Five senators seeking re-election, along line of Republicans weigh challenging Ohio's Glenn, butDemocrats have no one on the horizon against Arizona'sMcCain.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: Hoping to embarrass House Republicans,Democrats hand out buttons reading, &quot;I voted for thepresident's budget&quot; -- then are embarrassed themselves tofind the buttons were made by nonunion labor. . . . Moveover, Jesse Jackson] Touting Bush's education initiative,Boskin proclaims: &quot;You've got to learn it before you can earnit.&quot; . . .
