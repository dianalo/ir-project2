Infraredreflection spectra were measured in the range 600 to 10000 cm/sup -1/.Fringes were observed due to interference between light multiply-reflectedfrom the front surface and film-substrate (single crystal silicon) interface.Similar measurements were performed on films crystallized by post-depositionfurnace anneals. Analyses of the reflection spectra were used to obtainrefractive index profiles. Profiles were correlated with nitrogen contentas measured by Rutherford Backscattering Spectometry (RBS) and AugerElectron Spectroscopy (AES). Film adhesion, density, and purity werefound to be improved for depositions assisted by nitrogen ion beams (1000to 25,000 eV) relative to unassisted evaporation, and the index of refractiondecreases monotonically with increasing nitrogen content.</TEXT></DOC>
