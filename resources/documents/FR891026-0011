The purpose of the final ruleis to enable consumers to compare the absorbency of one brand and styleof tampons with the absorbency of all other brands and styles.Labeling of tampons to allow consumers to compare the absorbency of differentbrands and styles is important because the use of tampons is associatedwith toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a rare but serious and sometimes fataldisease, and the risk of contracting TSS increases with the use of tamponsof higher absorbency.

Background</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 23, 1988 (53 FR 37250) (correctedNovember 3, 1988 (53 FR 44551, and January 17, 1989 (54 FR 1844)), FDAproposed to amend its current regulation governing user labeling for menstrualtampons (21 CFR 801.430) to require uniform absorbency testing of tamponsand to standardize a method of expressing absorbency on tampon packagelabels. The agency proposed such testing and labeling requirements to enableconsumers to make interbrand comparisons and choose the least absorbenttampon needed to control menstrual flow and, thus, reduce their risk ofTSS.Interested persons were given until December 22, 1988, to submit writtencomments on the proposal. The agency received more than 270 comments fromtampon manufacturers, individual consumers, consumer groups, health careprofessionals, and researchers. After analyzing the comments concerningthe agency's proposal to use a system of letters to represent absorbencyranges and not to standardize currently used terms of absorbency (e.g.,regular, super, and super plus), the agency decided to issue a reproposalthat would have replaced the letter designations with six absorbency termsthat were different from, and would have been used in addition to, existingterms. The new terms (low absorbency, medium absorbency, medium-high absorbency,high absorbency, very high absorbency, and highest absorbency) correspondedto the six absorbency ranges described in the initital proposal (53 FR37250). The reproposal, which was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of June 12, 1989 (54 FR 25076) (corrected June28, 1989 (54 FR 27188)), also would have required that the new terms beplaced on the principal display panel of tampon packages to minimize anyconfusion that might have been created by the continued use of existingnonstandardized terms.The reproposal included a summary of the comments received on the September1988 proposed rule and the agency's response to them, and a tentative responseto a citizen petition submitted by the Public Citizen Health Research Groupconcerning absorbency labeling for tampons. Interested persons were givenuntil August 11, 1989, to submit written comments on the reproposal.The agency received 39 comments on the reproposal from tampon manufacturers,individual consumers, consumer groups, and health care professionals. Asummary of these comments and the agency's response to them are set outin section II of this preamble.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary and Analysis of Comments </ITAG>A. General Comments 1. Almost all the comments, including those from tampon manufacturers,continued to support FDA's overall goal to ensure that absorbency informationis provided to consumers. Specific suggestions included in the commentson how to improve the reproposed rule to provide the most truthful, accurate,and nonmisleading information on tampon absorbency are addressed in subsequentsections of this preamble. FDA concludes, on the basis of the data and information discussed and cited,and for the reasons set out in the preamble to both the proposed rule andthe reproposed rule and in this preamble, and taking into account the data,information, and views presented in the comments, that a final rule shouldbe issued. As intended, the final rule will enable consumers to comparethe absorbency of one brand and style of tampons with the absorbency ofall other brands and styles, to choose the lowest absorbency needed tocontrol menstrual flow, and, as a result, to reduce their risk of TSS.2. One comment addressed the proposed revision of the estimated incidenceof TSS included in current 21 CFR 801.430(d)(2). This comment noted thatmuch of the data on which FDA bases that estimate were published in 1980and 1981, and that the composition of many tampons has changed since then.The comment recommended that FDA use only the most up-to-date publishedincidence rates (as cited in 54 FR 25076 at 25079, approximately 1 to 2cases of TSS per 100,000 menstruating girls and women per year) and shoulddisregard the earlier published data (as cited in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of June 22, 1982 (47 FR 26982), between 6 and17 cases of TSS per 100,000 menstruating girls and women per year). As stated in the preamble to the reproposed rule (54 FR 25076 at 25079),FDA believes that the actual incidence of TSS can only be estimated, andthat it is appropriate to convey to consumers the full range of reasonableestimates. There must be a rational basis for the agency to choose oneestimate over another. FDA does not agree that the suggestion that thecomposition of many tampons has changed over the years provides such abasis. Therefore, FDA has concluded that the estimated incidence of TSSin current andSection; 801.430(d)(2) should be revised as proposed. The finalrule states that estimate of TSS to be from 1 to 17 cases per 100,000 menstruatinggirls and women per year. 3. Two manufacturers commented on FDA's statement in the preamble to thereproposed rule (54 FR 25076 at 25079) that tampons are misbranded undersection 502(f)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act)(21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)), because current tampon labeling does not containany information with which a woman can determine relative absorbency ofdifferent brands of tampons. One manufacturer noted that FDA had attemptedto clarify this issue, but recommended that, to avoid any possible confusionand misinterpretation of any final rule, FDA make clear that tampons onthe market are not misbranded and that no tampon can be considered to bemisbranded for noncompliance with the final rule unless it is introducedinto commerce after the rule's effective date. The other manufacturer continuedto disagree that the failure to provide such absorbency information renderstampons misbranded. In response to these comments, FDA reiterates that, as the agency tentativelyconcluded (53 FR 37250 at 37254), omission of uniform absorbency informationdoes render tampons misbranded within the meaning of section 502 (a) and(f)(1) of the act. But, rather than act against individual tampons to remedythe deficiency, FDA has elected, consistent with its authority, to addressthe misbranding by requiring a uniform labeling system through rulemaking.As provided in andSection; 801.403(h) of the final rule, any tampon thatis not labeled as required by the final rule and that is initially introducedinto interstate commerce after the effective date of the final rule ismisbranded under sections 201(n) and 502 (a) and (f) of the act (21 U.S.C.321(n) and 352 (a) and (f)). (The effective date of the final rule is discussedin section II E of this preamble.) B. Approaches to Absorbency Labeling 4. FDA specifically requested comment (54 FR 25076 at 25081) on whetherthe use of fixed, nonoverlapping ranges would be inconsistent with thegoal of enabling consumers to reduce their risk of TSS. Comments on thisissue were received from consumer groups, consumers, and tampon manufacturers. One consumer group continued to reject fixed, nonoverlapping ranges statingthat a single number is necessary to adequately convey absorbency informationto consumers. This comment suggested that the use of ranges would preventwomen from being able to distinguish between tampon brands or styles ateither the low or high end of a given absorbency range. It also noted thatsome styles of currently marketed tampons would have to be reformulatedbecause their absorbency is on the boundary between ranges. The commentalso urged that single numbers are more informative and clearer than ranges,that women are familiar with some manufacturers' current use of numbers,and that scientists have been using single numbers to designate the absorbencyof tampons since 1981. Most of the individual consumers favored the use of nonoverlapping ranges,as did three other consumer groups and all the manufacturers. These commentsgenerally agreed with FDA's tentative conclusion (53 FR 37250 at 37260),or agreed with the statements on the issue in the reproposed rule (54 FR25076 at 25080), that variations in tampon production and tampon absorbencytesting make the use of ranges necessary; that the ranges chosen by FDAwere appropriate and as narrow as possible given current production andtesting; and that the benefit of truthful, nonmisleading, and accuratelabeling outweighs the potential risks posed by the increased absorbencyof some tampons that would result from product reformulation. Several individualconsumers suggested reducing the number of ranges to avoid confusion andincrease comprehension.As stated in the preambles to the proposed rule (53 FR 37250 at 37260)and the reproposed rule (54 FR 25076 at 25080), the data show that a singlenumerical designation does not accurately represent the contents of a givenbox of tampons, and that the only truthful, accurate, and nonmisleadingrepresentation of the contents of a box can be that it contains tamponswith absorbencies within a given range. Most of the comments agreed withFDA's interpretation of the data.If future advances in technology across the industry allowed the productionof tampons and the measurement of their absorbency such that there wereonly slight variations from an average absorbency, FDA would consider proposingamendments to this final rule.Reducing the number of ranges could not be accomplished by simply eliminatingone or more of them, because there is no basis for FDA to ban the use ofany of the ranges, whether at the top or bottom end. The only way to reducethe number of ranges is to create ranges that are unnecessarily broad.FDA disagrees, therefore, with the recommendation that the ranges of absorbencybe reduced below six.5. FDA received many comments on whether to standardize a new set of termsor standardize the existing terms currently used by manufacturers, e.g.,regular, super, and super plus.One manufacturer and six individual consumers supported the reproposalrequiring the use of new and standardized terms, but allowing the use offamiliar and unstandardized terms. The manufacturer argued that the reproposedabsorbency nomenclature was straightforward and clear, and objected tostandardizing existing terms because it would have little impact on reinforcingabsorbency information.Four consumer groups, 4 manufacturers, 1 health professional organization,and 15 individual consumers strongly objected to the reproposal to allowthe dual use of a new set of standardized terms with nonstandardized existingterms. These comments were unanimous in their view that such a dual systemwould result in consumer confusion and the failure of the reproposed ruleto accomplish its intended goal of enabling consumers to compare, beforepurchase, the absorbency of one brand and style of tampons with the absorbencyof other brands and styles. These comments differed, however, in theirsuggestions on how to eliminate the confusion that would result from thelabeling scheme in the reproposal.One consumer group, the health professional organization, and nine individualconsumers stated that the new terms in the reproposed rule were acceptable,and that confusion would be eliminated if the use of existing terms wereproscribed. Three consumer groups, four manufacturers (representing approximately90 percent of the tampon market), and six individual consumers argued thatthe best approach was simply to standardize the existing terms that havebeen used for years and with which women are familiar. In addition, severalcomments suggested minor modifications of the new terms, if the new termswere retained in the final rule.FDA has concluded, based on its own analysis, and on the preponderanceof comments, which represent a large portion of the public that will beaffected by this rule, that allowing any combination of standardized andnonstandardized absorbency terms will confuse rather than inform consumers,as a result of which the reproposed rule would not have achieved its statedpublic health purposes. Presented with two sets of terms on the same package,consumers would likely continue to choose tampons based on the familiarterms, which would not be uniform throughout the tampon industry.The agency rejects the option of using the new terms in the reproposaland proscribing the use of existing terms because it would fail to takeadvantage of consumer familiarity with existing terms. Moreover, it wouldbe a more restrictive limitation on labeling than is necessary to servethe purpose of the final rule.The agency agrees with the suggestion simply to standardize existing terms,without the addition of any new terms for the following reasons. This approachavoids any possible confusion; it is likely to be very easily understoodby all consumers; is overwhelmingly the option most favored by consumers,who are the target audience for the information; it is the simplest toimplement; and it is strengthened by and takes advantage of consumer familiaritywith existing terms. Accordingly, the agency has revised reproposed andSection;801.430(e)(1) in the final rule to standardize the existing absorbencyterms (junior, regular, super, and super plus) corresponding to the followingfour absorbency ranges: less than 6, 6 to 9, 9 to 12, and 12 to 15 gramsof fluid, respectively, and to provide for no absorbency terms for thetwo absorbency ranges above 15 grams of fluid. Because absorbency terms,for the first time, will be valid indicators of absorbency across all tamponbrands and styles, FDA believes that it is appropriate to require the word``absorbency'' to accompany the existing terms, just as the reproposalwould have required the word ``absorbency'' to accompany the new terms.Also, requiring the word ``absorbency'' on the package in conjunction withthe absorbency term will alert consumers to the fact that the labelinghas been changed.The final rule does not include a corresponding term of absorbency forthe ranges 15 to 18 grams or above 18 grams of fluid. FDA is unaware ofany currently marketed tampon that absorbs more than 18 grams of fluidand also is unaware of any currently used, and therefore familiar, termof absorbency used to describe such a product. Any person who is requiredto register under section 510 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360) and 21 CFR part807 of FDA's regulation and who intends to begin the introduction or deliveryfor introduction into interstate commerce of such a tampon for commercialdistribution is required to submit a premarket notification to FDA in accordancewith section 510(k) of the act and Subpart E of 21 CFR part 807 at least90 days before making such introduction or delivery. Under andSection; 807.87(e),a premarket notification for a device is to contain, among other things,labeling for the device. Based on such a submission for a tampon that absorbsmore than 18 grams of fluid, the agency will determine whether the labelingis appropriate and does not misbrand or adulterate the tampon under section501 or 502 of the act (21 U.S.C. 351 and 352) and whether the tampon requirespremarket approval under section 515 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e).FDA is aware of one product in the 15 to 18-gram range that is currentlylabeled super plus. The manufacturer of this product will be required tolower the absorbency to continue to use the term super plus. All othermanufacturers apply the term super plus to products with absorbencies inthe 12 to 15-gram range. If the manufacturer using the term super plusfor a product in the 15 to 18-gram range chose to keep this product atits current absorbency, FDA would review any term of absorbency proposedby the manufacturer. Because the final rule does not preclude the use ofother labeling that is not false or misleading, the agency would considerthe use of the absorbency range in andSection; 801.430(e)(1) to be acceptable.C. Absorbency Testing6. Three manufacturers commented on the test method for determining tamponabsorbency. One manufacturer recommended that the final rule permit manufacturersto use either the proposed or the reproposed method with appropriate technicaladjustments that can be shown to be necessary to minimize error. Anothermanufacturer objected to the inclusion of a tensile strength requirementfor the condom used in the test, arguing that there are no data showingthat the results of the test are related to condom tensile strength andthat ensuring that the tensile strength provision is met would be overlyburdensome to tampon manufacturers. The third manufacturer objected tothe provision in the reproposed rule that would have allowed alternativeways to reach the endpoint of the test (i.e., fluid either exits from theapparatus or appears in the folds of the condom below the tampon). Thecomment stated that this provision would create more interlaboratory errorin the test method when some manufacturers select one alternative and somethe other because, based on this manufacturer's preliminary data, the twoendpoints could vary by as much as 0.5 grams of fluid.The agency continues to recognize that individual manufacturers may wishto use an absorbency test method different from the test method specifiedin the final rule. Therefore, the agency has retained in the final rulea provision for a manufacturer to submit evidence, in the form of a citizenpetition, demonstrating to the agency's satisfaction that the alternativemethod will yield test results that are equivalent to the results usingthe test method in the final rule. FDA believes, however, that allowing``technical adjustments'' to the test method by individual manufacturerswould likely lead to significant differences between the absorbency resultsobtained by different manufacturers. Neither the proposed nor reproposedrules would have permitted such adjustments and FDA has included no provisionsin the final rule for manufacturers to make technical adjustments withoutFDA approval as described above. The agency does agree, however, that multipleendpoints could result in unnecessary variability in test results betweenmanufacturers. Therefore, in response to the comments, and after reconsiderationof the position taken in the reproposed rule, andSection; 801.430(f)(2) isrevised to state that the test should be terminated when the tampon issaturated and the first drop of fluid exits the apparatus.FDA disagrees with the comment objecting to the inclusion of a condom tensilestrength provision. FDA included this provision in repsonse to a commenton the proposed rule indicating that there was a need to specify the condomto be used. The earlier comment included information that identifying onebrand of condom would not suffice because modifications in that brand madeby the condom manufacturer would affect the test result. As condom manufacturersmodify their products to respond to the market desire for condoms thatare more resistant to breakage, it is possible that unnecessary variationscould be introduced into the test method. For these reasons, FDA has concludedthat it is necessary to specify the tensile strength of the condom usedin the test method. FDA does not believe that this requirement would beoverly burdensome. FDA's experience shows that tensile strengths greaterthan 30 Mega Pascals are associated with clearly thicker latex condoms,suggesting that tampon manufacturers may be able to use thickness in acceptancetesting to ensure this tensile strength requirement is met. Alternatively,quality assurance data provided by the condom supplier could be availableto the tampon manufacturer as a possible means to comply with this provision.7. Three consumer groups continued to urge FDA to adopt a 95/95 toleranceinterval to provide the highest degree of assurance that tampons in factfall within the specified ranges. Three manufacturers agreed that a 90/90tolerance interval was acceptable, but expressed concern over a wordingchange in the reproposal that would have applied the tolerance intervalto tampons within a package and not within a brand and type.As stated in the preamble to the reproposed rule (54 FR 25076 at 25084),FDA has concluded that it is technically infeasible for manufacturers tocomply with a requirement that there be a 95 percent probability that 95percent of tampons fall within the labeled range, that it is technicallyfeasible for all manufacturers to comply with a 90/90 tolerance interval,and that a 90/90 tolerance interval would provide a sufficiently high degreeof assurance that tampons fall within the labeled range. In the absenceof data to the contrary, the agency has not changed its conclusion. FDAdoes agree that an inappropriate wording change was made in the reproposedrule when the tolerance interval was applied to tampons in a package. Theintent of the agency remains as stated in the proposed rule where the toleranceinterval was applied to tampons within a brand or type, and, accordingly,has revised the final rule.8. One manufacturer continued to posit that imprecision in the test methodwarranted applying the tolerance intervals to average absorbencies fromsmall groups of tampons. In support of this position, the manufacturersubmitted additional data comparing the absorbencies of two groups of tamponswith the same average weight. One group, however, had a normally distributednarrow weight range (andplusmin; 1 percent) and one group had a normallydistributed wide weight range (andplusmin; 8 percent). The average standarddeviation for the syngyna values of tampons from the narrow weight rangegroup was 0.4, and the average standard deviation from the wide weightrange group was 0.66. The comment interpreted these data as confirmingthat the variation was due only to the test method for the narrow weightrange group and the test method plus weight variation for the wide weightrange group. Because of the test method variability, the comment concludedthat it was appropriate to allow averaging of the absorbency values ofsmall groups of tampons. Two consumer groups and one manufacturer agreedwith FDA's conclusion that testing should be based on individual productunit values, rather than on averages.FDA carefully evaluated the new data submitted in the comment and has concludedthat the data do not demonstrate that there is such a large variabilityin the test method that it is necessary to apply tolerance intervals toaverage absorbencies. FDA believes that the data collection approach submittedwith the comment, overlooks the contribution that all variables in themanufacturing process make to the final result. Thus, FDA concludes fromthe data that the standard deviation of 0.4 in the narrow weight groupis the result of variations in the test method, fibers, and manufacturing;and that the standard deviation of 0.66 in the wide weight range groupis the result of all of these variables plus weight. To find the variationattributable to the method exclusively would require a more detailed andcarefully controlled experiment in which the several potential sourcesof variation in raw material and manufacturing were quantified and evaluatedto determine their influence on the absorbency measurement.D. Content and Location of Labeling9. Four consumer groups and several individual consumers expressed concernthat the use of the word ``labeling'' in reproposed andSection; 801.430(d)would result in absorbency information being placed only in the packageinsert and not on the package label. One manufacturer suggested that theabsorbency information be expanded to make specific reference to the linkbetween tampon absorbency and the risk of TSS. Three consumer groups supportedthe language in the reproposal that would clearly identify in the labelingthe practice of alternating tampon and sanitary pad use with reducing therisk of TSS.The final rule (andSection; 801.430(e)(1)) requires that absorbency informationshall be prominently and legibly placed on the package label of menstrualtampons. The absorbency information may not be placed only in a packageinsert. Section 801.430(e)(2) requires that the package label shall includean explanation of the ranges of absorbency and a description of how consumerscan use a range of absorbency, and its corresponding absorbency term, tomake comparisons of absorbency of tampons to allow selection of the tamponwith the minimum absorbency needed to control menstrual flow in order toreduce the risk of contracting TSS.10. Three manufacturers expressed concern that the prominence requirementin reproposed andSection; 801.430(e)(2) would result in restrictions on genericnames, brand names, and the like that were not intended in the reproposal.One consumer group requested clarification as to the meaning of prominentand conspicuous in reproposed andSection; 801.430(e)(2). To ensure prominence,various comments suggested graphs/scales/guages; bold format, as in theSurgeon General's warning on cigarette packages; color-coding; and theuse of dramatic labeling on cellophane wrappers.Because FDA has decided in the final rule to require the standardizationof existing terms instead of new terms, the language in reproposed andSection;801.430(e)(2) is removed from the final rule. Although FDA agrees thatthere are specific ways to ensure prominence of the labeling required inthe final rule, the agency has concluded that there is no need to specifyany single approach, thus providing flexibility to manufacturers.11. Two consumer groups, two individual consumers, and one manufacturercommented on the need for ingredient labeling. The two consumer groupsreiterated the support for ingredient labeling. The two individual consumersargued that it should not be necessary for an ingredient to be a healthrisk to justify ingredient labeling for tampons; materials should be disclosedso women can make an ``intelligent choice,'' e.g., choose tampons withnatural fibers. The manufacturer reiterated that manufacturers now voluntarilyprovide ingredient information, but agreed that FDA has insufficient legalbasis for requiring it.FDA tentatively concluded in the preamble to the reproposed rule (54 FR25076 at 25085) that it does not have the authority under the act to requiretampon manufacturers to list ingredient information on product labeling,unless such ingredient information were necessary for the safe and effectiveuse of tampons. None of the comments favoring ingredient labeling cited,discussed, or submitted any data showing an association between any particularingredient and any risk to health, including allergic reaction, sensitivity,or irritation, and FDA is unaware of any such data. Moreover, none of thecomments provided any legal theory under which the agency could requireingredient labeling for tampons. Absent information indicating that thedisclosure of tampon ingredients on package labeling is necessary for thesafe or effective use of the product, or that the omission of such informationis material to the safe or effective use of the tampons, FDA has concludedthat the act does not provide the agency with authority to require tamponmanufacturers to list ingredient information on product labeling.E. Effective Date12. Two consumer groups supported a 6-month implementation date as thelatest acceptable effective date. One manufacturer considered 6 monthsto be sufficient time for it to comply with the proposed rule. Three manufacturerscontinued to object to a 6-month effective date. These manufacturers claimedthey would have difficulty meeting a 6-month effective date because theywould have to make labeling changes and product design changes that wouldaffect manufacturing, including machinery, and testing protocols. Theyalso cited the unnecessary risk of having to scrap not only packaging butactual product in inventory. These comments suggested effective dates rangingfrom 9 months to 1 year. One individual consumer supported the view that6 months was not enough time for manufacturers to design effective packagingto meet the new regulation.As stated in the preamble to the reproposal, the agency believes that thebasic testing methodology required by the final rule has been acceptedby manufacturers, and that appropriate quality assurance programs havebeen in place since the device current good manufacturing practice (CGMP)regulations were promulgated in 1978 (21 CFR 820.20). Therefore, manufacturersare faced only with modification of existing quality assurance programsand not with creation of entirely new ones, and the need to develop andprint new product labeling. Given the public health importance of tamponabsorbency information, FDA believes that any time beyond 6 months is neithernecessary nor appropriate for implementation of the provisions in andSection;801.430(e) (1) and (2), and (f) regarding absorbency ranges and testing.Based upon available information, FDA had proposed that any final rulebecome effective 6 months after the date the final rule is published inthe <T4>Federal Register,</T4> because of the agency's belief that manufacturerswould need this amount of time to implement the labeling changes requiredin andSection; 801.430(e) (1) and (2). However, on September 29, 1989, theUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia ordered thatthe final tampon absorbency regulation become effective 4 months afterOctober 30, 1989, the date by which the court had, by its previous orderof August 29, 1989, directed that publication of the final rule occur.<T3>Public Citizen Health Research Group</T3> v. <T3>Commissioner, FDA</T3>, Civil Action No. 88-1492. Accordingly, thefinal rule is effective on March 1, 1990. Any menstrual tampon that isnot labeled as required by the final rule and that is initially introducedor initially delivered for introduction into commerce after March 1, 1990,is misbranded under sections 201(n) and 502 (a) and (f) of the act.The agency believes that manufacturers might want for some period of timeto relate new labeling to the former product labeling. Therefore, the agencywould consider it appropriate if a manufacturer, for up to 12 months afterthe effective date of the final rule, chose to include, for example, theinformation ``formerly Brand X super'' in the product labeling.F. Vending Machines13. Two consumer groups and 10 individual consumers argued that the reproposedrule would not ensure that a consumer had the necessary information aboutabsorbency of vending machine products in order to make an informed choiceas between, for example, a tampon or a sanitary pad. One manufacturer arguedthat absorbency labeling of vending machine tampons is neither practicalnor necessary, since consumers must purchase whatever single product isavailable in a particular vending machine and do not have a choice.Because FDA has revised the final rule to standardize existing terms, theagency reviewed the provision (andSection; 801.430(g)) in the reproposedrule that did not exempt tampons sold in vending machines from the provisionof andSection; 801.430(e)(4). FDA no longer believes this provision is necessary,and has revised the final rule accordingly. FDA finds no basis in the commentsfor concluding that requiring tampons sold in vending machines to complywith the final rule is necessary to protect the public health.G. Public Citizen Health Research Group Petition14. No comments were received that specifically addressed the August 20,1987, citizen petition from the Health Research Group (HRG) (see 53 FR37250 at 37252 and 37253). FDA believes that the final rule, requiringuniform absorbency testing and a standardized method of expressing absorbency,is both technically feasible and adequate to address the need for publichealth protection. The final rule enables women to compare absorbenciesbetween brands and styles and to choose the lowest absorbency needed and,thus, reduce their risk of contracting TSS. To the extent that the finalrule does not include provisions requested by HRG in its August 20, 1987,citizen petition, the agency is denying the petition.H. Education15. Three consumer groups and three individual consumers urged FDA to continueits public education efforts to inform users of the association betweentampon absorbency and TSS risk. Specific suggestions included incorporatingTSS education information into school curricula, using formats targetedto specific age groups and making public service announcements.FDA agrees with the intent of these comments. FDA plans to employ a varietyof educational approaches to provide updated information to new tamponusers, higher risk groups for TSS such as young women and teenage girls,and the general public, and will consider the suggestions provided in thecomments.I. Miscellaneous16. A comment from two consumer groups presented data on problems withthe structural integrity of tampons and urged FDA to increase the priorityfor the development of a standard for tampon performance to include parameterssuch as biocompatibility, leachability of materials, anchor string strength,and smoothness and mechanical operation of the tampon inserter.FDA will consider the new data submitted in the comment in its continuingrevision of its priorities for development of mandatory standards for medicaldevices.17. An individual consumer recommended against the use of metric measures,expressing the view that they are poorly understood and virtually meaninglessto the general public.The purpose of the determination of the fluid absorbed by a tampon is toprovide a quantitative measure of absorbency that can be used in makinginterbrand comparisons. FDA does not believe that it is necessary to useEnglish system units (ounces) to do that, and rejects the recommendation.18. FDA also received suggestions for further changes in tampon labeling.For example, one comment recommended that the agency require recommendationsand warnings for women with unusually heavy menstrual periods. Anothercomment recommended establishing a minimum absorbency to protect consumersfrom fraudulent products and a maximum absorbency to safeguard the healthof consumers.FDA believes that the warnings about the link between TSS and tampon absorbency,and the admonition to reduce that risk by alternating tampon use with menstrualpads, will provide all women, including those with unusually heavy periods,the information they need to take action to reduce the risk of TSS. Theagency does not believe that there is a basis for establishing either aminimum absorbency or a maximum absorbency for tampon products, and, therefore,rejects that comment.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Environmental Impact</ITAG>The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(11) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Economic Impact</ITAG>As stated in the preambles to the proposed and reproposed rules, FDA hasassessed the economic consequences of the final rule in accordance withthe criteria in section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 and found that therule is not a major rule under the Executive Order. No comments were receivedin response to the reproposed rule relating to FDA's assessment. As inthe reproposed rule, FDA estimates that the final rule will impose directcosts of $75,000 on each tampon manufacturer. Therefore, the agency continuesto conclude that the rule is not a major rule under the Executive Order.The agency also has considered the effect that the final rule will haveon small entities including small businesses. The agency believes thatonly one of the affected manufacturers meets the definition of a smallentity under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), and no commentswere submitted on the matter. Therefore, FDA certifies under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act that the final rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. A further descriptionof these new costs and the methods for estimating them can be found inthe revised threshold assessment on file with the Dockets Management Branch,Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD20857.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Paperwork Reduction</ITAG>This final rule (andSection; 801.430 (e) and (f)) contains information collectionrequirements that were submitted for review and approval to the Director,Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as required by section 3507 of thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

The condom ispulled through until all slack is removed. The tip of the condom is cutoff and the remaining end of the condom is stretched over the end of thetube and secured with a rubber band. A preweighed (to the nearest 0.01gram) tampon is placed within the condom membrane so that the center ofgravity of the tampon is at the center of the chamber. An infusion needle(14 gauge) is inserted through the septum created by the condom tip untilit contacts the end of the tampon. The outer chamber is filled with waterpumped from a temperature-controlled waterbath to maintain the averagetemperature at 27andplusmin;1 anddegrees;C. The water returns to the waterbathas shown in Figure 2. Syngyna fluid (10 grams sodium chloride, 0.5 gramCertified Reagent Acid Fuchsin, 1,000 milliliters distilled water) is thenpumped through the infusion needle at a rate of 50 milliliters per hour.The test shall be terminated when the tampon is saturated and the firstdrop of fluid exits the apparatus. (The test result shall be discardedif fluid is detected in the folds of the condom before the tampon is saturated).The water is then drained and the tampon is removed and immediately weighedto the nearest 0.01 gram. The absorbency of the tampon is determined bysubtracting its dry weight from this value. The condom shall be replacedafter 10 tests or at the end of the day during which the condom is usedin testing, whichever occurs first.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Copies of the standard are available from the AmericanSociety for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race St., Philadelphia, PA 19103,or available for inspection at the Office of the Federal Register, 1100L St., NW., Washington, DC.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4160-01-M002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 0 841-842</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4160-01-C </ITAG>(3) The Food and Drug Administration may permit the use of an absorbencytest method different from the test method specified in this section ifeach of the following conditions is met:(i) The manufacturer presents evidence, in the form of a citizen petitionsubmitted in accordance with the requirements of andSection; 10.30 of thischapter, demonstrating that the alternative test method will yield resultsthat are equivalent to the results yielded by the test method specifiedin this section; and (ii) FDA approves the method and has published notice of its approval ofthe alternative test method in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>(g) Any menstrual tampon intended to be dispensed by a vending machineis exempt from the requirements of this section.(h) Any menstrual tampon that is not labeled as required by paragraphs(c), (d), and (e) of this section and that is initially introduced or initiallydelivered for introduction into commerce after March 1, 1990, is misbrandedunder sections 201(n), 502 (a) and (f) of the act.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Information collection requirements contained in paragraphs (e) and(f) were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under controlnumber 0910-0257)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James S.
