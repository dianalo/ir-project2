The paramagnetic C{sub 6}H{sub 5}PCo{sub 3}(CO){sub9} crystallizes in the monoclinic system. Diamagnetic C{sub 6}H{sub 5}PFeCo{sub2}(CO){sub 9} is monoclinic. Both structures have been determined usingPatterson and Fourier methods and refined to R values of 0.071 (CO{sub3}compound) and 0.058 (FeCo{sub 2} compound) for 2841 and 2566 reflections,respectively. The shapes of both molecules are nearly identical, butthe additional antibonding electron lengthens the metal{endash}metalbonds in the CO{sub 3} compound to 2.717 (2) {angstrom} (av.) as comparedto 2.623 (2) {angstrom} (av.) in the FeCo{sub 2} compound. Slight differencesin the molecular packing of both compounds cause grossly different sizesand symmetries of their unit cells. 12 refs., 4 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
