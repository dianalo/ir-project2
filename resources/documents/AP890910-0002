At least six people were reported missing and three peopleapparently drowned in mishaps officials said were related to the seaswells, undertow and waves that have reached 15 feet in height, evenon rivers.   Though hundreds of miles from land, the spinning arms ofGabrielle were still sending waves banging against the seaboard.   Late Sunday, Gabrielle's winds had weakened to 65 mph and it wasdowngraded to a tropical storm. Gabrielle was located 350 milessouth-southwest of Sable Island, Nova Scotia, the National HurricaneCenter in Florida said.   ``People shouldn't be out there,'' said Jarred Randall, aNarragansett, R.I., police sergeant who rescued two teen-agers fromthe water Saturday night. ``It's just so majestic and inviting, butit isn't safe.''   Gabrielle has been churning out in the Atlantic since Aug. 31.Its vastness and power has prompted comparisons with last year'sHurricane Gilbert, which became the ``storm of century'' anddevastated Jamaica.   ``The occasional rogue wave can come along, higher than theothers. It's kind of neat to look at the surf and people don'trealize there is personal danger when you're looking at 15-footwaves,'' said Coast Guard Quartermaster 1st Class David Jersey inBoston.   Jeff Waldstreicher, a meteorologist at the National WeatherService office in Boston, said that the waves and undertow werefierce up and down the coast.   ``You have these strong, 100-plus mile an hour winds thatgenerate all these waves and long after the waves have crested youhave all this energy, moving the water from east to west,''Waldstreicher said.   In the meantime, the wild water was causing havoc.   Dorothy Daggett, 19, of Cushing, Maine, apparently slipped andfell into the surf while walking Saturday night along the rockyshore in the mid-coastal fishing village of Tenants Harbor with herbrother and cousin, said Quartermaster 1st Class Robert Ream inSouthwest Harbor, Maine.   The two men went into the water after her and were also quicklyswept away from the shore. They were picked up by a fishing boat.   The Coast Guard searched for Ms. Daggett but she was stillmissing Sunday.   A Coast Guard helicopter rescued two surfers who got in troubleoff the coast of New Hampshire on Sunday. At the time, the chopperwas on its way to Salisbury Beach in Massachusetts to search for amiddle-aged swimmer reported missing by a lobsterman who said he sawthe man disappear into the water, Jersey said. No one was found,Jersey said.   And north of Boston, an Ipswich police patrol boat searched for a25-year-old man who vanished in the rough waters of the IpswichRiver north of Cape Ann.   Richard Troudt was with two other men and a baby sailing in an18-foot motor boat Saturday when the vessel capsized, the CoastGuard said. The other two men and the child were rescued by apassing vessel.   In New York, divers searched the Atlantic for a 37-year-old manmissing after a houseboat capsized two miles out from the BreezyPoint section of the New York City borough of Queens.   A 58-year-old woman apparently drowned when the houseboatcapsized about 2 a.m. Sunday. Her body was recovered.   Two fishermen in their 30s were swept off a New York City jettySaturday afternoon by a large wave. Searchers could not find the men.   In New Jersey, a man in his mid-50s died after being pulledunconscious from heavy surf Sunday morning at Barnegat Light, saidLong Beach Township Patrolman Joseph Paolino. A woman of about thesame age who was pulled out with him was revived and was underintensive care at a hospital.   A man drowned at Normandy Beach, but no other details wereavailable, Dover Township police said.   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Gabrielle was located near latitude 39.0north, longitude 62.0 west, or about 350 miles south-southwest ofSable Island, Nova Scotia.   Gabrielle is the seventh named storm of the Atlantic hurricaneseason. Systems become named tropical storms when their winds hit 39mph and are termed hurricanes at 74 mph.</TEXT></DOC>
