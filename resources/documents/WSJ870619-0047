Robins Co.    A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals turned aside arguments by several women's health organizations and a court-appointed committee for Dalkon Shield claimants that the health products maker's program to notify women in foreign countries about the deadline wasn't adequate.    Yesterday's ruling doesn't affect last month's order by a federal bankruptcy judge that Robins resend questionnaires to the 152,400 women who filed claims against the company but missed the deadline for responding to the inquiries.    Robins has operated under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since August 1985 because of the growing number of lawsuits by women claiming the intrauterine contraceptive device caused them to suffer a variety of ailments. Under Chapter 11, a company operates with court protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts.    When it sought bankruptcy-law protection, Robins and its insurer already had paid about $520 million to settle 9,450 Dalkon Shield cases and 6,000 more were pending. After notifying women of the deadline, more than 320,000 claims poured in from U.S. and foreign residents. </TEXT></DOC>
