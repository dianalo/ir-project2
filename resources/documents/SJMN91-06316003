At the same time, companies are stuck in many old ruts. They are notadopting new thinking or approaches to take advantage of opportunities.;   Oneof the deepest corporate ruts is the traditional model of organization -- themanagement pyramid. This model has existed for thousands of years inorganizations such as the military. It was adapted several hundred years agoto manage large businesses spawned by the Industrial Revolution.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business Monday  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE LAST MUST BE FIRST, THE FIRST LAST IN BUSINESS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Viewpoints; Jack A. Hamilton is vice president of the Information Group, aSanta Clara management consulting and education company.  </MEMO><TEXT>     In this bureaucratic command and control model, information in the form oforders is passed down through the chain of command. In the Navy, for example,the admiral tells the captain, the captain tells the commander, and so on downto the seaman. The results of orders are transmitted in reverse.;   DavidVincent points out in his book &quot;The Information-Based Corporation&quot; that intoday's corporate structure, entire layers of management neither manage norlead. They merely serve as conduit for communications up and down thepyramid.;   Vincent contends that these middle managers tenaciously defendtheir managerial role as information handlers. And they oppose informationtechnology that would replace them.;   But now the traditional organization isundergoing significant change. Global competition is forcing companies toremove whole levels of management personnel. We hear about the &quot;downsizedorganization,&quot; the changing role of the front line, and the &quot;invertedorganizational pyramid.&quot;;   When a company downsizes, it often doesn'tvisualize the end result and what it will take to function well. Cutting staffmay reduce costs in the short term. But that effect soon wears off.;   Tosupport the flattened structure that downsizing creates, a company needs tochange its information flow from vertical to horizontal. It must get itsmanagers to overcome turf issues and share information with other businessunits.;   The idea behind sharing information throughout a company is to movedecisions down to the point where action can be taken -- the front line. JanCarlzon, president of Scandinavian Airlines, said the front line of hiscompany consists of pilots, flight and ground crews, ticketing agents, baggagehandlers and others who deliver to the customer. Carlzon expects management tosupport front-line employees so they can take required action.;   Front-lineemployees in an information-based company are no longer directly supervised.They can obtain information electronically to make decisions. The decisionsare not only more rapid, but more focused, so more work is done.;   In thisinteractive organization, management supports front-line employees by makingsure they have access to current information on the business's imperatives --broad actions that must be accomplished for the business to succeed.;  Organizations drift when leaders don't keep imperatives clear. Imperativesfocus management and front-line actions on the company's success. Productivitygoes up when everyone from front-line employees to executives shares inpolicy-setting and decision-making and sees the link between their work andthe big picture.;   Control is a thing of the past. Management has lived underthe delusion that it was in control, and that good management meantmaintaining control.;   But now the genie is out of the bottle. The onlycontrol possible comes when employees control themselves. When management usesstrict control in an interactive organization, it can only fail.;   Powercomes from employee commitment. Executives foster commitment when they givepower to front-line employees who are in a better position to do things thanthey are. To empower employees, however, management must do more than give uppower.;   Management needs to empower employees by providing education,information and resources. In an interactive organization, employees arelinked by information networks, not by rigid channels of command. Then,employees can group themselves into self-managed teams with the skills andsupport to carry out their tasks.;   The former apex of the management pyramidis inverted and functions as support. It consists of management and corporatespecialists: legal counsel, capital management, government relations,corporate data bases, etc. The layers of managers who advised and sharedinformation are replaced by information systems.;   Information technology ishelping businesses get out of their ruts and plow new ground. For example,executives no longer have to depend on management to get information to andfrom the front line; executive information systems deliver front-line resultson their own terminals.;   The interactive organization does business in amore horizontal way. Information technology creates and supports thesestructures. It is used less and less as a tool for managing old ones. Itdoesn't make economic sense to build new systems and stick with old ways ofdoing business.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JACK A.
