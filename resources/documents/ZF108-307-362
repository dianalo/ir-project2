Harris, founder and chairman of AICorp.andP;  of Waltham, Mass., receivedhis Ph.D in computer science from Cornell University in 1972.andP;  From 1972 to1981, he was Professor of Computer Science at Dartmouth, where he wrote theINTELLECT natural language system.andP;  While at Dartmouth, he was also visitingprofessor at MIT's AI Laboratory.andP;  Harris, who founded AICorp in 1975, is theauthor of Artificial Intelligence Enters the Marketplace, published by BantamBooks in 1986.andP;  Harris recently met with DATAMATION executive editor David R.andO;Brousell to discuss the state of artificial intelligence.andM;Q: How far along has artificial intelligence technology come in the UnitedStates?andP;  Is it a mature discipline?andP;  If not, how must it develop?andP;  And what'sthe state of technology in Europe and Japan?andM;A: I think that it's important to remember at the very outset that IS is avery young discipline, a very young science and, as such, there's still atremendous amount yet to be conquered in the research arena.andP;  We still have anumber of issues that still have to be addressed at that level.andP;  But thatdoesn't take away from the amount of work that's been done over the last 30years that has begun to transition itself into the commercial sector.andP;  And Iwould say over the last eight or so years we've really seen it sort ofbeginning to trickle into the commercial arena.andM;Q: Are you satisfied with how far AI technology has come in delivering on thepromise of providing a system to aid human judgment?andM;A: I think that, in terms of the track record as an industry, it's beenpretty bad.andP;  I'm not at all satisfied in terms of what we as AI pioneers havebeen able to do in taking the technology out of the research environment anddelivering on the promise in the real commercial day-to-day world.andP;  I thinkwe've done an abysmal job as an industry in doing this.andM;I think that a number of people made some very early mistakes in terms oftrying to take the AI technology as it existed in the research environmentand saying &quot;here, take it exactly as it is, and you can form your environmentto fit this one particular function.andP;  It's such an important function thatit's worth doing back flips to get it into your environment.&quot;andP;  And the truthis, it is an important function, but the reality of the commercialenvironment ...andP;  [is that] there is a considerable amount of work that has tobe done to take the sort of gems of research that exist in the academicenvironment and case them so they are applicable in a routine way in thecommercial environment.andM;And this whole notion of LISP machines, very specialized processors [whichrun the LISP Programming AI language] that we heard about in the early partof the '80s and so forth, I think did a great dis-service to the field interms of making people think they had to go way out into left field in orderto take advantage of this technology.andP;  If many of the people who started outcommercializing the technology would have made the commitment and paid theprice themselves to build tools that work in concert with database managementsystems, mainframe operating systems, networks, we would have been muchfarther along in terms of the adaptation cycle than we happen to be today.andM;Q: So that has to take place now?andP;  What challenges have to be overcome beforepeople like you get further down that road?andM;A: I think it continues to be a process of providing tools that have the AIfunctionality to represent judgment.andP;  We can never lose sight of that.andO;That's absolutely the main point that has to be there.andP;  And then the otherpart of the equation is it has to be deliverable in the context of whateverthe commercial computing environment happens to be, which is a mixture ofboth mainframes and PCs.andM;Q: Are there any technical hurdles that must be cleared here?andM;A: Well, I think there is a considerable range of additional research thatcan be done, and is being done, in a number of areas that AI still tries toaddress, that is not commercially viable today.andP;  But in terms of the aspectof representing conventional business judgment, I think the systems availableare more than sufficient to deal with those issues.andM;Q: Now, how about Europe and Japan?andM;A: Let's take Europe first.andP;  I think they are, in terms of the businesssector, probably a few years behind any of the U.S.andP;  firms in adapting AItechnology.andP;  There are a number of companies, though, that are activelypursuing it, but I would say the numbers are smaller than they are here.andO;There certainly are fewer companies producing products.andM;Q: Why do you think that's so?andM;A: I think the tradition of AI research over there was much smaller than itwas in this country.andP;  The U.S.andP;  had a very strong lead in some of the majorresearch centers that got us off to a faster start.andP;  Now, in Japan, theystarted the Fifth-Generation project some years ago, a very aggressive effortto try to catch up in this particular area.andP;  And it had a strong commercialorientation to it, as well as a research orientation.andP;  But I personallyhaven't seen a tremendous amount come out of that, so my sense is that thereare a number of companies there that are pursuing it, but I think that inreality, in terms of both commercial products and in the commercialdeployment of the technology, they're probably still behind.andM;Q: Even further behind Europe?andM;A: I don't know if they're further behind Europe or not, but I'm saying interms of the specter of them catching us from behind, .andP;  .  .  I don't thinkthat's necessarily coming to fruition.andM;Q: How should the IS community look upon AI?andP;  Should they look at it as anadjunct to their existing COBOL-based, largely hierarchical but now evolvingrelational database world?andP;  Or should they look upon it as a separatetechnology?andP;  If it's an adjunct, is there a downside to it in the sence thatit helps perpetuate older systems?andP;  And if you see it as an adjunct, thenobviously there are integration issues, and maybe we could discuss some ofthose.andM;A: Yes, I think there's no question as to how the IS community should look atAI--clearly as another technology that should fit within their existing bagof tricks that they should choose to apply to the appropriate class ofapplications.andP;  The exciting part is that it opens new doors that potentiallyweren't open before.andP;  It's not something where you're just saying that it's a5 or 10% improvement in programmer productivity, that they can do the samethings they have always been doing, just a little bit faster.andP;  We're actuallysaying that there's a class of applications, such as insurance underwriting,that you can now routinely address.andM;Q: Could it proceed to the point where you can use artificial intelligencetechniques to make a business judgment of, let's say, a potential merger oracquisition?andM;A: Clearly that would be a judgmental area [for which] you could try toexpress the rules and analysis and the integration of information from avariety of sources and somehow bring that information together to make thejudgment--a taxing and difficult application but certainly one .andP;  .  .  Toput it another way, if you were to do that, if that was your goal--to buildsuch an application--I think you would be hard pressed not to use AI.andP;  And,again, just to emphasize my point earlier, that I think the AI communityitself did a great disservice in terms of trying to sell the technology: AIwas held to a very distinct, separate technology that did not integrate withthe rest of what was going on.andP;  And I think that nothing could be fartherfrom the truth.andP;  It is another style of programming that specificallyprovides techniques for representing and executing judgment on existingdatabases.andM;Q: What's your perception about senior management's view of AI technology?andO;What is the chief challenge in using it?andP;  Is it technological or is itmanagerial?andM;A: Well, it's both.andP;  There clearly are technical challenges in the sense thatit's a new way of constructing a machine, and clearly you're not going to oneday tell all the COBOL application programmers &quot;you're now doing everythingin AI.&quot;andP;  There's a training process in terms of what you're trying torepresent, how to represent it, how to encode it on the machine.andP;  Those are,I think, often less significant in terms of the long-term success of thedeployment.andP;  That will be done if you give sharp programmers new tools.andM;High-level management, in terms of their desire to say &quot;let's aggressively goafter this new area of applications that we couldn't do before,&quot; that's atough call, that's call that some people have the wherewithal to make andsome people don't.andP;  I mean, it's obviously a much higher risk adventure thandoing the same thing you did yesterday a little bit better.andP;  Some managerscome down on a different side of the fence there, but in terms of thepotential payback, in terms of bottom line profitability, competitiveness andso forth, the rewards can be tremendous.andP;  To a degree, I think that thosecompanies that play too conservative a role in this, and say &quot;don't getinvolved&quot; will find themselves at a considerable competitive disadvantagewhen some or most of their competitors have begun to employ this technology.andM;Q: Should there be standards in AI?andP;  And if so, would having them mean thatthe replicability of the technology would become greater, and thereforemaintaining a sustainable competitive edge would become more difficult?andM;A: Yeah, I think it's true what you're saying--that the second, third ortenth person to come along and do this probably has an easier time doing itbecause of the existence of standards or the regularization of the processthan the first person did.andP;  That's the case with anything new--the longer youwait the easier it will be to do.andP;  But, on the other hand, you're going to bethat much farther behind the pack.andM;Q: But what about standards?andM;A: I think standards are probably something that is coming about.andP;  My view isthat a lot of what's already out there in terms of relational databases andso forth already provides standards that the AI systems have to conform to.andO;Similarly, I think there are a number of AI terms, in terms of styles ofinferencing and object-oriented programming and so forth, that are becomingstandardized rather quickly, and that the marketplace is learning to employ,you know, use these sort of standard AI definitions for these facilities.andM;Q: How are they coming about?andP;  In a de facto manner or is there ...andM;A: It's de facto.andP;  I don't know if there are committees or not, but they arecertainly playing no role in terms of the definitions, that they are made inthe marketplace.andP;  And I've seen, I think, an improvement in the last coupleof years in terms of products, in terms of the facilities that they claim tooffer, supporting the sort of generic definition closer and closer, betterand better than they did in the earlier days.andM;Q: So, you then perceive a user demand for standards out there?andM;A: Absolutely, I mean, it's like you can look at every tool on the market,and they all have backward chaining, forward chaining, object-orientedprogramming, hypothetical reasoning, whatever the terms might be, and I thinkthat by and large the marketplace is coming to understand what to expect fromthose terms and what they mean, and putting pressure on the vendors who havea weaker definition of it to bring it up to the norm.andP;  And I think that'shappening in many of the products.andM;Q: What do you see as the role of the PC in the development of expertsystems?andP;  If integration with corporate databases is important, will the PCbe dislodged from its position as a chosen tool, or will there be somefacilities on the PCs that will enable them to take advantage of thosecorporate databases?andM;A: Well, certainly my view is that the trend is moving much more towards thePC becoming the preferred development environment and will even become thepreferred distribution environment or delivery environment in terms ofpresentation to the user.andP;  Basically, what it comes down to is that the veryhigh baud rate of communication to the screen and the local processing powermakes possible tremendously versatile user interfaces that simply aren'tpossible using the remote computation you'd require from a mainframe.andP;  Thisdoesn't mean they should be stand-alone PCs.andP;  I think people will beconnected to mainframes to get at the databases that will be centrally storedthere.andP;  But, as we look to the future, clearly that is much more the normthan the common perception of the past that there is just one big mainframewith a lot of dumb terminals hooked up with it.andM;Q: Integration with existing systems, particularly corporate databases, wouldseem to be critical, because if you're trying to achieve a realistic view ofthe business judgment of a corporation, the more comprehensive that view thebetter the program, right?andM;A: Absolutely I mean, there's no question you'd have to have access to thatdata.andP;  The point is that when you write the program, you shouldn'tnecessarily care where that data happens to live today.andP;  The goal inproviding these systems is to allow the developer to focus on the judgmentinvolved.andP;  Accessing that data on the mainframe needs to be done to make thatbasically transparent to the program.andP;  He can do that whether he's on the PC;he can do that whether he's on the mainframe.andP;  And he does it in exactly thesame way.andM;Q: Should an AI development worker using a PC, therefore, be part of the ISorganization?andM;A: Well, I think in terms of the mainstream, corporate mission-criticalapplications--for example, underwriting--I think it very much belongs in theMIS/DP arena.andP;  I think there's a host of other, smaller, more departmentallyfocused applications that can be developed in groups that might be outside ofmainstream DP.andP;  In other words, judgment lives everywhere.andM;The sole benefactor is not all in the MIS department and you can try toautomate that [judgment] or encapsulate that into programs in [many]different places.andM;Q: I suppose a lot of it has to do with how a company wishes to run.andP;  If youwant to be a hierarchical organization with decision making coming from thetop down, you probably have less need to have your expert system workersworking independently and making judgments.andM;A: Clearly you have to follow the philosophy of the company.andP;  I think theinteresting thing with regard to the PC and graphical user interfaces is thata lot of these systems can be deployed in small niches and places that wouldhave been very hard to get to before.andM;Q: But this does raise integration issues, correct?andM;A: Integration is perhaps the key biggest stumbling block today primarilybecause the basic tools for communications and networking aren't there yet interms of somebody really tying their PCs together with mainframe data andproviding access to that in a transparent fashion.andM;I see it as an area that, I think, will be made easier and easier overall byhardware companies and some database vendors.andP;  But also we have to look at itfrom the point of view, as we develop the AI tools, that we have theopportunity to define the language in such a way that you can easily accessforeign, remote data objects as if they were in memory, for example.andP;  Or thatyou can easily manipulate graphics images on the screen.andP;  When COBOL wasdeveloped, none of these concepts existed.andP;  In the COBOL language itself, youcan't touch a database.andP;  You have to use another language embedded within theCOBOL to actually do that.andP;  Similarly, if you want to do graphics programmingin COBOL, you can't do that directly in COBOL, you have to invoke some othergraphics system to do that.andP;  There's no perimeters in COBOL for doing that.andO;Now, as we design these new AI systems, and we see that the world has changeda tremendous amount since COBOL was first designed, we have the opportunityto say, &quot;look, these are things that we'd like as perimeters in theseprogramming languages&quot; to make it very easy to do graphics manipulation,[and] to access remote data objects.andM;Q: What key applications do you see driving AI and expert systems in theupcoming years?andM;A: Well, I think there's a few in the security area perhaps that I have seenin terms of diagnostics.andP;  We're seeing a lot of interest in this, not justfrom computer companies, but from any number of manufacturers that sellcomplicated equipment of any form, as to how they can put diagnostics intothe machinery itself so it can recommend preventative maintenance, and if itdoes break down to try to figure out, to recommend, what needs to be changed.andO;If it's the circuit board or a part, the system should be able to tell youthat itself.andM;And, then, even if you know what part that is, there are applications thatcompanies are building to try to find [out] how to get that part to younationwide as fast as possible based on where inventories are and so forth,so that a lot of what we consider meat and potatoes tasks can be addressedeffectively by this technology.andP;  It's not just restricted to the financialmarkets and so forth.andM;I would say that we're more focused on areas where in some sense you havesomebody who can tell you what the right answer is.andP;  Like in an insuranceunderwriting cases where you can have the computer make its judgement andthen you can have your best underwriter say Yes that's either right or wrongand you can tell right now.andM;Q: One wonders about new, emerging areas, like health care, waste management,pollution control.andP;  Will these be driving applications?andM;A: I think it's any area where there's a number of countervailing forces atwork that h ave to be assessed and balanced out and where judgment ultimatelygets applied to figure out what to do.andP;  If all the forces were all going inone direction, it's real easy to decide what to do.andP;  It's when you startdealing with these situations where there's pluses and minuses and balancingout and you have to make some judgment calls, [that] is where this technologyapplies.andM;I see it probably more definitively in a lot of marketing and salessituations for exactly that reason.andP;  You have applications where you'retrying to project your products onto a particular customer's needs, which isnot necessarily an easy thing to do for companies that have literallyhundreds of products.andP;  Customers don't come knocking at doors saying &quot;I wantto buy exactly that produc t.&quot;andP;  That certainly is true in the financialmarket.andP;  There's hundreds of choices, and you don't know which one is best.andM;Similarly, you could be selling chemicals--it's the same thing, the customerdoesn't know enough, and there's trouble necessarily training each individualsalesman to be an expert in recommending one of hundreds of products.andP;  So thedegree to which you can take, you know, the judgment of one of your topengineers and say &quot;that's what the customer wants to do, here's the rightproduct to recommend for them&quot; is a tremendously powerful force to be able todistribute and deliver throughout the marketplace--in terms of benefits tothe customer, as well as benefits as a competitive advantage to the company.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
