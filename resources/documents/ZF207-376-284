 In addition to licensing their software, most vendors canprovide custom applications-development services.andM;These products support both text- and image-retrieval functions on PC-basedsystems.andP;  Products that support text retrieval only are not included here.andM;----------CD ANSWER 2.0, Dataware Technologies Inc.andP;  This menu-driven programminginterface lets developers define the database structure, paint query anddisplay screens, and define indexes to retrieve information types.andM;CD Answer's imaging capability can display uncompressed and compressed rasterimages stored in CCITT Facsimile Group 4 format.andP;  Users can zoom image pagesby as much as 300 percent, rotate 90 degrees in any direction and pan anyselected image.andM;Color Graphics Adapter (CGA), Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA), Video GraphicsArray (VGA) and monochrome graphics adapters are supported.andM;Dataware charges a one-time unlimited-use fee of $30,000, or an annual feefor every CD ROM produced with the CD Answer software.andM;Dataware Technologies Inc. is located at 222 Third St., Suite 3300,Cambridge, Mass.andP;  02142 (617) 621-0820.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Bill Farrell, director of new products development at US West Communications,a major supplier of telecommunications services in Denver, liked theproduct's flexibility and easy modification.andM;&quot;The changes [we want to make] are up to us, so Dataware has put control inour hands rather than someone else's hands.andP;  If someone wants to update thesoftware, we do it.andP;  We're very much satisfied,&quot; he said.andM;Bob Shively, manager of dealer communications systems at Ford New HollandInc., a division of Ford Motor Co. in New Holland, Pa., helped develop anin-house CD ROM that placed a huge engine-parts price list on disk.andM;&quot;I found that Dataware offered feature-rich software to take care of ourimmediate development needs, plus enhancements such as [imaging] features wewould need in the near future.andP;  They provided the best product,&quot; he said.andM;Shively looked for a product that did not require coding or other highlytechnical skills.andM;&quot;Our systems people didn't have time to develop software,&quot; he explained.andP;  &quot;Inorder to justify making the CD ROM, we looked for a product that wasnon-technical in nature.andP;  Dataware supplied that.andP;  They also provided thepost-sale support we needed to develop [our] product.&quot;andM;SEARCHEXPRESS 2.5, Executive Technologies Inc.andP;  This product integratestext-retrieval and image-display capabilities, along with automatic indexing,horizontal scrolling, support for foreign character sets and a built-inthesaurus.andM;Image-display features include the ability to uncompress image files, displaywith pan and scroll, and print raster images.andP;  Monochrome, color andgray-scale images can be displayed.andP;  The images can be input via a scanner orcreated with PC Paintbrush or other graphics programs.andM;Developers can create pull-down menus, beginner and expert modes, as many as255 user-definable data fields and a multiple-step table of contents.andP;  Ahypertext feature links related objects together.andP;  The CD ROM version ofSearchExpress starts at $5,000.andM;Executive Technologies Inc. is located at 2120 16th Ave.andP;  S., Birmingham,Ala.andP;  35205 (205) 933-5494.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;&quot;It's a good all-around package that had all the elements we were lookingfor,&quot; said Jay Tindall, a project manager of multimedia at Reactive SystemsInc., a promotion firm in Teaneck, N.J.andM;Tindall said the product's imaging feature was &quot;usable, but could be better,&quot;because while it supports .PCX file format, he would like to see support forGroup 4 compression.andM;Other users were satisfied with the product's image-retrieval methods.andM;&quot;We've integrated image retrieval with SearchExpress on various projectsthrough external DOS system calls, which SearchExpress provides hooks to,&quot;said Mike Mooney, vice president of Distributive Data Corp., a softwaredeveloper in Bethlehem, Pa.andP;  &quot;It's an excellent product.&quot;andM;TEXTWARE, Unibase Systems Inc.andP;  This text-retrieval product is available forstand-alone DOS-based PCs, Novell NetWare and 3Com 3+ LANs, Wang VS, DigitalEquipment Corp.andP;  VMS and IBM VM systems.andM;Text-retrieval applications can be created for use with CD ROM, writeonce/read many (WORM), floppy-disk or hard-disk storage media.andO;Text-retrieval features include the ability to create compressed indexes andmultiple databases.andP;  TextWare indexes every word, which eliminates the needfor key fields.andP;  Optional add-in utility software includes text-preparation,data-security and indexing programs.andM;An optional external program allows the linking of graphics files with textinformation.andM;Pricing for TextWare starts at $495 for a single-user license and $2,995 foran unlimited license.andM;Unibase is located at 333 Main St., Park City, Utah 84060 (801) 649-4440.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Andy Waterous, project manager at Alde Publishing Inc., a CD ROM publisher inMinneapolis, chose TextWare because, &quot;it was fairly inexpensive and offersfull text searching and retrieval.andP;  We can do all our indexing on 386machines in-house, and don't have to send [our data] to a service bureau,&quot; hesaid.andM;&quot;It takes a long time to index with TextWare, but that's common with alltext-retrieval software packages,&quot; he added.andM;Waterous would like to see the imaging capability improved.andP;  &quot;The type ofimage files you need are Dr.andP;  Halo files [from Media Cybernetics Inc.], whichis an unusual file type,&quot; he said.andM;Jack Speer, president of Buckmaster Publishing Co., a publisher in Mineral,Va., looked at several packages before settling on TextWare.andM;&quot;We ran into stone walls with each one because of the amount of text youcould put on CD ROM,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;When I got to TextWare, I was able toperform the kind of indexing that we wanted to do.andP;  You can deal with fulltext, and the indexing speed and storage requirements are manageable in a CDROM environment.andP;  In other words, we don't have to use a VAX.andP;  We use a 386for indexing.&quot;andM;Overall, Speer was happy with the product, but claimed that its documentationwas &quot;weak&quot; and could be improved.andM;FULL TEXT MANAGER, Reference Technology Inc.andP;

 Images can be accessed from indexed databases,and text can be scrolled on-screen while an image is in view.andM;Prices start at $395 per CPU.andM;Reference Technology Inc. is located at 5700 Flatiron Parkway, Boulder, Colo.andO;80301 (303) 449-4157.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;&quot;We're real happy with it,&quot; said Ed Miller, chief of publications at the U.S.andO;Army Corps of Engineers in Washington.andP;  Miller has placed engineeringregulations and manuals on CD ROM for internal distribution.andM;&quot;We got a good price with this one.andP;  [The vendor has] done a good job --they're easy to work with.andP;  The user interface has been received well by ourpeople in the field.&quot;andM;QUANTUM LEAP 2.0, Quantum Access Inc.andP;  This menu-driven developers' packageprovides indexing and database-management tools for custom text- andimage-retrieval applications.andM;Custom search-and-retrieve applications can combine free-form text,structured databases, bit-mapped images, audio data and vector graphics onthe same CD ROM file.andP;
