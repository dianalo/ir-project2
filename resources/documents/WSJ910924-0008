A call to his base in the Bahamas found 78-year-old SirJohn unsurprisingly upbeat about the downfall of Sovietcommunism (add &quot;perhaps as much as 1% per year&quot; to the worldeconomy's growth rate, he figures) but with one eye on theequally &quot;exciting&quot; prospect of a dramatic decline in Japanesereal-estate prices, &quot;the largest single financial influencewe should be observing and watching.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   With threats of nuclear war and communist dominationmostly gone, he says, &quot;surely it means more internationalcommerce, more communications, more travel, more investingacross international boundaries, more spread of religion,more brotherhood&quot; and less arms spending. &quot;We should beoverwhelmingly grateful.&quot;   If world investors have reacted with restraint, it isbecause &quot;the effects will be witnessed five to 15 years fromnow,&quot; says Sir John. &quot;Markets usually don't look that farahead.&quot;   His own managed funds, which total about $18 billion, havetaken affairs in stride because &quot;we were already expectingthe recovery from the recent recession in most nations andtherefore had more than the normal proportions in commonstocks. . . . The effect has been that we've been morewilling to invest world-wide rather than in our own nation.&quot;(You take that to mean the U.S., although the Tennessee-bornMr. Templeton actually has been a British citizen -- hencehis 1987 knighting -- since moving to the Caribbean more than20 years ago.)   Does he include Japan and East Asia in a global buyingspree? &quot;Except for price, yes.&quot; Which usually means no. He'slegendary for hunting value opportunities and notes that&quot;Japanese share prices are still 37 times earnings,&quot; evenafter the Nikkei's troubles of late. &quot;When we find somethingin Japan that is a good value, we find something similar inanother nation that is an even better value.&quot;   Sir John doesn't see particular trouble ahead for Japaninternally, but those dependent on Japanese participationelsewhere had best be on guard. When the Nikkei dropped 48%in 10 months last year, he points out, $2 trillionevaporated. If that country's property market were to fall bya similar degree, the loss would be $8 trillion -- &quot;largerthan all the stock-market valuations in the world.&quot;   Not if, but when, he says. &quot;I would even say that weexpect it, though we don't expect it on any particulartimetable. It will eventually happen, but maybe not for along time.&quot; In the event, Japan won't be buying nearly asmuch foreign equities, real estate or Treasurys.   Nevertheless, Sir John is not one of the bears about theU.S. debt market, the folks who told us a few months ago (sofar, very wrongly) to get into gold ahead of financial-systemmeltdown that would send interest rates skyrocketing. That&quot;seems not especially likely,&quot; he understates. Runaway publicborrowing is more a cue for inflation than a liquiditysqueeze, in his view, but even in that circumstance hedoesn't see gold -- which he believes still to be at anhistorically high level -- doing any better than othercommodities.   The state of the U.S. banking system is &quot;terrible, but itwon't have a great effect on the nation. It will have aneffect on {bank} shareholders,&quot; he chuckles. Thoughacknowledging that the rise of bond funds and other savingsinstruments is contributing to a drain of capital fromtraditional lenders, he finds &quot;very little&quot; impact on thefinancing of U.S. enterprises. The sales climate, notinterest rates, determines the demand for loans.   What about those denied financing at any rate? &quot;That'sonly because they've got a bad business. If you've got a goodbusiness, you can get capital at some price,&quot; at home orabroad, he says. Of course, &quot;there are exceptions toanything.&quot;   After a lifetime of amassing wealth, Sir John devotes muchof his energies to giving it away. Consistent with hispronounced piety, his donations to various churches andcharities amount to tithing, he says. The Templeton Prize for&quot;progress in religion&quot; bestows $800,000 annually on anindividual judged to have most advanced this field so dear tothe sponsor's heart.   Although for him religion and economic freedom go hand inhand, the two often prove a combustible mix in other minds.On the day the 1990 award was announced, a co-winnerpublished a Malthusian newspaper commentary that began &quot;Theworld is a Titanic on a collision course&quot; and ended with acall for less consumption by the affluent so that not onlythe poor but other species might gain.   &quot;The people who have become professionals in mostreligions are relatively ignorant about the workaday world,about economics or how business operates,&quot; the donor laments,speaking generally. &quot;They become caught up in the conceptthat if someone becomes rich, it's because he stepped onsomeone else. That's not true. You become rich by helpingpeople.&quot;   The John Templeton Foundation tries to help familieschoosing a college by publishing separate &quot;honor rolls&quot; ofU.S. institutions based on their rating for&quot;character-building&quot; and &quot;free-enterprise teaching.&quot;Individual economists and academic programs come in for cashawards under another bequest.   One of his secular beneficiaries has been the newlyrenamed Templeton College of Management at Oxford, which hesays is now the third largest of the English school's threedozen divisions. And Sir John says the most important thingbusiness schools can teach is ethics.   Yet, even as Wall Street seems perpetually tarnished byscandal, this fabled financier thinks morality in business isno worse off now than it's been for generations, and higherthan it was a century or two ago.   Perceptions to the contrary are &quot;a media problem,&quot; as hedescribes it. &quot;The availability of the information {aboutwrongdoing} is so much more rapid and extensive than it everwas.&quot; And &quot;the fact that 999 out of 1,000&quot; on Wall Street arestraight arrows doesn't make news.   &quot;The percentage of people in trouble is no higher than itwas 20 years ago or 50 years ago. It's just that people hearabout it more. Up until 20 years ago, there was no radio ortelevision coverage of the subject of Wall Street.&quot;   But wouldn't Salomon Brothers, the central force in thekey financial market in the world, qualify as more than amere outlier? &quot;Yes, but Richard Whitney also went bankrupt,&quot;he responds, harking back to the New York Stock Exchangepresident disgraced in the 1930s.   &quot;Let's put it this way: The volume of trading in New Yorkis 100 times as great as it was only 50 years ago,&quot; heconcludes. &quot;If you took a ratio of the number of scandals,the amount of money lost in dishonest things, it's probablysmaller today in relation to the size of the operation.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
