With the 49-45 vote, the bar association's house of delegates rejected the recommendation of a bar committee that found mandatory legal education did nothing to improve lawyer competency.    &quot;Lawyers should not be in the business of fooling the public,&quot; said Francis Musselman, chairman of the special committee on lawyer competency. Mandatory legal education is &quot;cosmetic,&quot; he said, and is &quot;designed to fool the public that the profession is doing something significant.&quot; But the house of delegates disagreed.    Thirty-two states currently require lawyers to attend continuing legal education classes, and all states have voluntary legal education programs. The report on implementing mandatory legal education in New York could be ready in time for the bar association's April meeting, according to state bar president Henry King. </TEXT></DOC>
