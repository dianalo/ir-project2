Dodge said.    All three broad categories of construction -- nonresidential, housing and public works -- rose last month. One industry analyst said, however, that the increase stemmed from better weather and didn't signal the start of a long-lasting uptrend.    F.W. Dodge, the forecasting unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., said U.S. construction contracts awarded in February rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $249.7 billion, the highest level since last October and up from $228 billion in January. That brought the Dodge index up to 159 from 145 in January. The index compares current contracting with a 1977 base of 100.    The main reason was that nonresidential building rose 14% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $86.1 billion from a January value of $75.6 billion. George A. Christie, vice president and chief economist for F.W. Dodge, said, &quot;Considering January's weakness, a temporary rebound in commercial building wasn't at all surprising.    &quot;We know from experience that anything that happens in February or January you take with a grain of salt because it's so weather-related.&quot; He said that because of poor weather, projects that were delayed in January were awarded in February.    He added, however, that commercial buildings -- especially office buildings -- are still overbuilt, and construction in that market &quot;is expected to be ratcheting its way down over the rest of 1988.&quot; Activity in the first two months of 1988 combined was slightly behind the pace of the last quarter of 1987, he said.    One exception is industrial building. Because the weak dollar has spurred U.S. manufacturing and exports, Mr. Christie said, industrial building is likely to remain strong to the end of 1988.    Contracting for residential buildings climbed 9% to an annualized $120.2 billion from $110.4 billion in January. But single-family dwellings were roughly unchanged; most of the gain was in multifamily housing and hotels. The residential increase also was weather-related, the economist said.    He said the annualized rate of house building in 1988 thus far trails the rate of the last quarter of 1987. He predicted, however, that house building would pick up this spring, thanks to lower interest rates.    Nonbuilding-construction contracting, or public works and utilities, rose 3% to an annualized rate of $43.4 billion in February from $42 billion in January. Transportation-related building, such as highways, bridges and mass transit, rose 6%, while environmental construction slumped 15%.    ---                                   a-Feb.
