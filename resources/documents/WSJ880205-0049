The metal products maker said 1987 net rose to $63.3 million, or $2.20 a share, from $46.4 million, or $1.56 a share, a year earlier. Sales edged up 3% to $1.17 billion from $1.13 billion. The company declined to release fourth-quarter earnings.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Harsco's stock dropped $2.25 to close at $26.50.    Malcolm W. Gambill, Harsco president and chief executive officer, said he expects 1988 earnings to top 1987 profit but fall below earlier expectations because of delays in delivering five-ton tactical trucks under a big Army contract. A spokeswoman said both Mr. Gambill and analysts had estimated per-share earnings in the $2.80 to $3 range.    Harsco has a five-year contract to build 15,200 trucks. But the company said it is having problems qualifying all its vendors and obtaining approval for parts. As a result, 1988 deliveries will be &quot;significantly reduced.&quot;    The original schedule had called for delivery of about 6,000 trucks by year end, but Harsco said it won't reach full production until the final quarter of 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
