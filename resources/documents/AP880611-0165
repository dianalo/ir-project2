Divorce petitions are public record and appear regularly in manynewspapers. Initials in some cases are used to obscure theidentities of couples.   Garza asked Soliz to call the new policy to the attention ofanyone who is filing a divorce suit.   Judge Joaquin Villarreal of the 347th District Court said hedisagrees with Garza's stance.   A divorce ``is a personal matter between husband and wife,''Villarreal said. ``If the two parties don't want the public to knowthey are getting divorced, it's fine with me.''   Soliz said he cannot refuse to accept such a case if thepetition is in order, and that cases are assigned randomly bycomputer.   In initials-only cases assigned to Garza's court, Soliz said hewill ask attorneys to modify the papers to fit with the judge'sspecifications.</TEXT></DOC>
