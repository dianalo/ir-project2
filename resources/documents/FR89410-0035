Blank, RegulatoryProcedures and Penalties Division (202) 566-8317.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Prior to the enactment of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-690,Title VI) (the Act), an owner whose property was seized by Customs forcivil forfeiture pursuant to section 596 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19U.S.C. 1595a(a)), section 511(a) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.881(a)), or section 2 of the Act of August 9, 1939 (53 Stat. 1291; 49 U.S.C.App. 782) could raise rights or defenses to forfeiture of the propertyin a petition requesting return of the property pursuant to Part 171, CustomsRegulations (19 CFR Part 171), but there was no time limit in which Customswould have to make a decision on the petition.Section 6079 of the Act was passed specifically to minimize the adverseimpact caused by prolonged detention of property seized for violationsinvolving the possession of personal use quantities of a controlled substance.Pursuant to section 6079, such property shall be promptly returned wherean owner can establish: (1) A valid, good faith interest in the property;(2) that he did not know of or consent to the violation; and (3) that hehad at no time any knowledge or reason to believe that the property wasbeing or would be used in violation of law; or that if he at any time had,or should have had knowledge that the property would be used in a violation,that he did what reasonably could be expected to prevent the violation.The statute requires the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasuryto prescribe regulations allowing for the expedited administrative procedures.Section 6079 also requires that at the time a conveyance is seized fora violation involving the possession of personal use quantities of a controlledsubstance, the officer making the seizure shall furnish a written noticespecifying the expedited procedures to any person in possession of theconveyance. At the earliest practicable opportunity after determining ownershipof the seized conveyance, a written notice is to be provided to the ownerand other interested parties, including lienholders, of the legal and factualbasis of the seizure.Finally, section 6079 provides that the Attorney General, Secretary ofthe Treasury and the Secretary of Transportation shall provide joint regulationsproviding for issuance of a summons to appear in lieu of seizure of a commercialfishing industry vessel for violations involving the possession of personaluse quantities of a controlled substance. These regulations are to applywhen the violation is committed on a commercial fishing industry vesselthat is proceeding to or from a fishing area or intermediate port of callor is actually engaged in fishing operations. Existing authority to arrestan individual for drug-related offenses or to release that individual intothe custody of the vessel's master is not affected by this statute. Thejurisdiction of the district court for any forfeiture incurred shall notbe affected by the use of a summons rather than a seizure. <ITAG tagnum="85">Procedures Formulated With Justice and Transportation Departments</ITAG>Since the President signed the Act, representatives of the Department ofJustice on behalf of the Attorney General, the U.S. Coast Guard on behalfof the Secretary of Transportation and the U.S. Customs Service on behalfof the Secretary of the Treasury have been in consultation as directedby section 6079 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act. The proposed regulations setforth below are to be read in conjunction with proposed regulations fromthe Department of Justice and the Department of Trnasportation that alsoappear in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>. (April 10, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Changes</ITAG>Amendments to the Customs Regulations to implement section 6079 are proposedto be set forth in a new Subpart F of Part 171, Customs Regulations (19CFR Part 171, Subpart F). Other minor changes are proposed to the regulationsin Parts 171 and 162.The proposed regulations are intended to supplement existing law and proceduresrelative to the forfeiture of property. Existing legal and equitable rightsand remedies of those with an interest in property seized for forfeitureare not affected by these proposed regulations.The proposed regulations relate only to seizures of property due to violationsof law involving personal use quantities of controlled substances. Theproposed regulations define personal use quantities in andSection; 171.51(b)(6).This definition is intended to distinguish between those quantities smallin amount which are generally considered to be possessed for personal consumptionand not for distribution and larger quantities generally considered tobe subject to distribution.Pursuant to section 6079 of Pub. L. 100-690, the proposed regulations providetwo alternatives: (1) Upon receipt of a petition, Customs will attemptto make a final administrative determination regarding the dispositionof property seized for particular statutory violations involving the possessionof personal use quantities of a controlled substance within 21 days ofthe seizure. (2) If such a determination is not made within 21 days, Customsshall determine, within 20 days after receiving a timely submitted petitionfor expedited procedures, whether a petitioner established his right tohave the property returned or whether Customs should proceed with the administrativeforfeiture action. These alternatives are set forth in proposed andSection;171.53.A petitioner must establish three elements: (1) That he has a valid, goodfaith interest in the seized property; (2) that he reasonably attemptedto ascertain the use of the property in a normal and customary manner;and (3) that he either did not know or consent to the illegal use of theproperty or, if he knew or should have known of the illegal use, he didwhat reasonably could be expected to prevent the violation. This is setforth in proposed andSection; 171.52(c).In order to receive expedited processing, a petition must be received byCustoms within 20 days from the date that Customs mails the notice of seizure(or in the case of a commercial fishing industry vessel for which a summonsto appear is issued, 20 days from the date when the vessel is requiredto report) and shall include a complete description of the property, includingidentification numbers and the date and place of the violation and seizure;a description of the petitioner's interest in the property supported bythe documentation, bills of sale, contract, mortgages or other satisfactorydocumentary evidence; and a statement of the facts and circumstances reliedupon by the petitioner to justify expedited return of the seized propertysupported by satisfactory evidence. This is set forth in proposed andSection;171.52(d) and (e).Pursuant to proposed andSection; 171.55, written notice of these procedureswill be provided to the possessor of the seized property at the time ofseizure. In addition, notice to all interested parties having a legal interestin the property shall be made at the earliest practicable opportunity afterdetermining ownership of the seized property.The proposed regulations also provide in andSection;171.52(b) that if a violationinvolving the possession of personal use quantities of a controlled substanceis committed on a commercial fishing industry vessel proceeding to or froma fishing area or intermediate port of call or actually engaged in fishingoperations, the commercial fishing industry vessel shall not be seized.Instead, a summons to appear will be issued. The vessel will be requiredto report on the date, and to the port, specified in the summons. Commercialfishing industry vessel is defined in proposed andSection; 171.51(b)(2).When a commercial fishing industry vessel reports as required, an appropriateCustoms officer will, depending on the facts and circumstances, eitherissue another summons to appear at a time deemed appropriate, execute aconstructive seizure agreement pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1605, or take physicalcustody of the vessel.Also set forth in the proposed regulations is a provision allowing a monetaryamount equal to the value of the seized property to be substituted forthe seized property (substitute res provision). Proposed andSection; 171.54,Customs Regulations, states that an owner or interested party may pay toCustoms an amount equal to the appraised value of seized property and havethe seized property released, unless the property is evidence of a violationof law or has design or other characteristics that particularly suit itfor use in illegal activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>Before adopting the proposal, consideration will be given to any writtencomments (preferably in triplicate) timely submitted to Customs. Commentssubmitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with theFreedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), andSection; 1.4, Treasury DepartmentRegulations (31 CFR 1.4), and andSection; 103.11, Customs Regulations (19CFR 103.11(b)), on regular business days between the hours of 9:00 a.m.and 4:30 p.m. at the Regulations and Disclosure Law Branch, Room 2119,Customs Headquarters, 1301 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20229.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>It is certified that the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), are not applicable to these amendments, because therule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>This document does not meet the criteria for a ``major rule'' as specifiedin section 1(b) of E.O. 12291.

L. No. 100-690, Title VI(102 Stat. 4181). They are intended to supplement existing law and proceduresrelative to the forfeiture of property under the identified statutory authority.The provisions of these regulations do not affect the existing legal andequitable rights and remedies of those with an interest in property seizedfor forfeiture, nor do these provisions relieve interested parties fromtheir existing obligations and responsibilities in pursuing their intereststhrough such courses of action. These regulations are intended to reflectthe intent of Congress to minimize the adverse impact occasioned by theprolonged detention of property subject to forfeiture due to violationsof law involving possession of personal use quantities of controlled substances.The definition of personal use quantities of controlled substance as containedherein is intended to distinguish between those quantities small in amountwhich are generally considered to be possessed for personal consumptionand not for distribution, and those larger quantities generally consideredto be subject to distribution.
