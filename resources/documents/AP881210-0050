(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President-elect George Bush's ability tocontrol the $150 billion federal budget deficit and the tradedeficit will have a lasting effect on his foreign policy, a formersecretary of state says.   ``Economics and foreign policy are ever-increasinglyentertwined,'' said Cyrus Vance, who headed the State Departmentunder President Carter.   Vance, one of five former secretaries of state here Friday, spokeat a news conference before they began taping a two-hour televisionspecial to be aired by Public Broadcasting Service stations Jan. 2.   Vance said Bush must deal strongly and effectively with ``thetwin deficits, the budget deficit and the trade deficit. ... What hedoes in regard to that particular issue is going to have a majoreffect, in the long run, on our foreign policy.''   The Sixth Annual Report from the Secretaries of State wassponsored by the Atlanta-based Southern Center for InternationalStudies and Nashville's David Lipscomb University. The formerCabinet officials were invited here by Gov. Ned McWherter, a trusteeof the non-profit educational organization.   The former secretaries said Bush should continue PresidentReagan's policies toward Russia but should not gear them to Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``I think he may be gone in a couple of years,'' Vance said.   ``Gorbachev acts as he does because he recognizes that the Sovieteconomy is a mess and it has to be improved,'' said Henry Kissinger,secretary of state under presidents Nixon and Ford. ``It's a bigmistake to gear our policies totally to one Soviet personality.''   Vance agreed with Kissinger that Gorbachev faces an uphill battlein bringing about his desired domestic reforms and likely will fallfrom power if he fails.   William Rogers, also secretary of state under Nixon, said Bushshould ``continue the policies of the Reagan administration.... Ithink the prospects for peace are very good (but) we have to remainstrong militarily.''   There was some disagreement with Reagan:   _ Kissinger opposed talks with Iran regarding the Lebanesehostage situation, as the president suggested in a Thursday newsconference.   _ Vance called refusal to admit Yasser Arafat into the country toaddress the United Nations a serious mistake that will handicap Bushpolicies.   Kissinger said he was violently opposed to any talks on releasinghostages.   ``Once you begin negotiating on the release of hostages, you haveindicated there is the price and the only thing left to negotiate isthe price _ and therefore, hostage taking has a reward,'' Kissingersaid. ``I know this sounds cruel, I know this is tough on thefamilies, but I believe that devaluing hostages is the only way youcan prevent hostages from being taken.''   Kissinger and Edmund Muskie, who succeeded Vance as secretary ofstate under Carter, predicted the hostages in Lebanon will bereleased because it will be in Iran's interest to try to returnrelations with the United States to normal.   Vance said Secretary of State George Shultz's decision not togrant Arafat a visa to argue for a Palestine state before the UnitedNations ``was a serious mistake because it helped those who wereopposed to progress in the Middle East and it disadvantaged thosewho would like to see us get the peace process going ahead. I thinkit makes it more difficult for the Bush administration to act as anhonest broker in the Middle East.''</TEXT></DOC>
