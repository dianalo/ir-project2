This week's Wall Street Journal/NBC poll found 40% in favor of the administration's policy of aiding the Contras and 43% against, in contrast with 32% approval and 54% disapproval only two months ago. A Richard Wirthlin poll for the White House actually shows the Contras pulling ahead, with a narrow plurality now in favor of aid.    We're told this change is merely the result of Lt. Col. North's &quot;charisma,&quot; will fade when he's no longer mesmerizing folks on TV, and need not affect Congress's vote on further aid to the Contras. We have a different theory: The national town meeting led by Mr. North finally has educated the American electorate about Nicaragua.    Opposition to Contra aid recorded in the polls always has been skin-deep, because the American people never before have focused on Central America. Last November, for example, an Associated Press poll asked what kind of government Nicaragua had; 29% said it had a communist government, but 25% thought it was a right-wing dictatorship, while 31% didn't know. In a New York Times/CBS News poll in April 1986, only 38% knew which side the U.S. was supporting in Nicaragua. Among those who knew, 40% supported and 52% opposed the aid; among those who didn't know, 16% supported and 69% opposed. As the stakes in Central America are better understood, support for the Contras increases.    So much so, in fact, that results are overwhelming among the populations who understand best -- Nicaragua's neighbors. In January, CID, the Central American affiliate of the respected Gallup International Research Institutes, asked 5,000 people in four countries for their opinions of the Contras, Nicaragua and U.S. involvement in the region. (CID wanted to ask Nicaraguans the same questions, but public-opinion polls are illegal there.) The results, some of which are summarized above, are startling.    This particular poll was commissioned by the United States Information Agency, which some critics suggest somehow taints the results. But CID President Charles Denton points out that his organization's regular polls in March confirmed many of the findings. A sample of 1,200 Costa Ricans found that, by 52% to 14%, they viewed the Contra cause as &quot;just.&quot; Asked how much of a threat the Sandinista government posed to Costa Rica's borders, 70% said a great deal, 15% said some and 7% a little. Hondurans backed U.S. funding of the Contras by 62% to 15%, and a surprising 48% believed the Contras ultimately would win. Only 11% believed the Sandinistas would prevail.    Mr. Denton says, &quot;Our surveys have shown for years that most Central Americans -- across all income groups -- like and admire the U.S., are worried about the Sandinistas and look with favor on the Contra cause. Many observers simply can't believe those findings so they dismiss them.&quot;    Encouraged by public reaction to the North hearings, the White House probably will increase its Contra-funding request for an 18-month period beginning in October from $105 million to $140 million. That would arm thousands of additional resistance fighters and move the Contras closer to the critical mass needed to undermine the Sandinista junta. One shouldn't forget that the Sandinistas had only 6,000 men in the field when they toppled Somoza, and few gave them any chance of winning until they were almost at the gates of Managua.    If it comes to be perceived that the Contras actually might win, public support will grow even more dramatically. The same congressional left that has taken comfort from public-opinion polls on Nicaragua was stunned by the reaction of the American people to Grenada.    ---   Would you say the (Sandinista) government of Nicaragua represents the majority of the people or that it represents a minority?
