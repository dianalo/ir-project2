SwarnsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   FLOODS NEEDN'T always be entirely bad news. Here's one Pennsylvania city that turned natural disaster into economic opportunity. It's a case study that shows how a community down on its luck can rejuvenate itself, given a combination of careful planning, citizen initiative, and a couple hundred million dollars in government disaster aid.    Fifteen years ago this June, Hurricane Agnes roared up the mid-Atlantic Coast. The storm brought torrential rains that filled the Susquehanna River to overflowing. By the time the flood crest reached the coal-mining town of Wilkes-Barre in northeastern Pennsylvania, the river was 14 feet over its banks.    The muddy water pushed through downtown, inundating dilapidated commercial buildings and run-down neighborhoods. About 40% of the city was devastated, including the entire downtown core. Quick evacuation saved all but two lives, but property damage totaled $539 million, and 482 families lost their homes.    THE 1972 FLOOD was one more downward step in a long economic decline for Wilkes-Barre. Settled in the mid-1800s by European immigrants looking for jobs in the local anthracite mines, the town enjoyed prosperity when coal was king. But when much of the world switched to oil, the community began to wither.    In the 1960s, Wilkes-Barre tried to diversify by luring textile, tobacco and shoe manufacturers. By the time the flood hit, even those businesses were pulling out.    &quot;Everything was going downhill,&quot; says Edward Schecter, former president of Wilkes-Barre's Committee for Economic Growth. &quot;Unemployment was around 14%. Department stores weren't doing business; theaters began to close. Young people couldn't find jobs, and that left us with an aging population.&quot;    Adds Steven Gliboff, who graduated from Wilkes College in the city in 1971 and promptly moved to New York: &quot;Anyone I knew wanted to get out.&quot;    The flood proved to be the catalyst for the city's turnaround. The federal and state governments gave $190 million in flood relief funds, and the Small Business Administration offered loans at 1% interest with the first $5,000 of principal forgiven. Some 32,600 homeowners and 3,300 businesses in Wilkes-Barre and its surroundings applied for the government largesse.    USING A PLAN drafted by local architects and engineers, the city used its disaster windfall to acquire and demolish buildings, to relocate families, and to rebuild roads, side walks, sewers and utility lines. Among the planner's goals: avoiding excessive dependence on any one industry and company, and remaking downtown to function as both commercial hub and revived residential area.    By 1982, 10 years after the flood, a hotel and three new office towers with retail fronts had replaced 27 small buildings that ringed the town square in the old days. Boscov's, an innovative retailer with department stores throughout Pennsylvania, opened a store in center city. Today, lighted glass canopies with shiny red supports cover four blocks of downtown restaurants and specialty shops. Wilkes-Barre's sidewalks don't roll up at dusk.    Still, word about Wilkes-Barre's revival was slow in spreading. &quot;Although the city had begun to rehabilitate physically,&quot; Mr. Schecter says, &quot;we were falling behind in terms of bringing in new industry.&quot;    So Mr. Schecter's committee hit the road, touting to companies in the mood to expand Wilkes-Barre's new infrastructure, its relatively inexpensive land, and its proximity to Philadelphia and New York.    ONE CONTACT was the Student Loan Marketing Association, a private, federally chartered corporation that buys insured student loans. Sallie Mae, as the association is known, was seeking a site for a back-shop accounting and administrative office.    &quot;Wilkes-Barre wanted us in a bad way, but they were very professional,&quot; recalls Barry Morrow, Sallie Mae's director of loan services. &quot;They didn't wine and dine. They did it with facts and figures.&quot; Within a day, he says, the city's committee pulled together figures about office space and local taxes that other cities &quot;couldn't get for us at all.&quot;    Sallie Mae opted for Wilkes-Barre. So did Nabisco Brands Inc., and Document Automation Corp., each opening back-shop operations there. The expected result of the three moves: a total of 1,200 new jobs in Wilkes-Barre by next year. Ray Wright, a Nabisco senior vice president, says his company &quot;had operations in major centers like Chicago, but in comparing productivity, Wilkes-Barre came out ahead.&quot;    &quot;The flood was a blessing,&quot; says Theodore Engel, dean of Wilkes College's School of Business and Economics. &quot;Unemployment is significantly lower, and there has been an increase in quality jobs.&quot;    Indeed, growing white-collar employment seems to be helping the city hold on to its youth, in contrast to the 1960s and 1970s. Some are even coming back. Mr. Gliboff returned from New York two years ago after hearing about the city's resurrection. Now he runs a food emporium in the spruced-up downtown.    &quot;The streets aren't paved with gold,&quot; he says, &quot;but they aren't paved with fool's gold either.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
