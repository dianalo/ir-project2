It is necessary to rememberthat the non-participating volumes could be very different for symmetricand asymmetric reactions. The onset of the multifragmentation channelor rather the cease of the fusion process is the first topic to be discussed.This question is directly related to the limitation in energy and momentumtransfer and thus to the question about nuclear transparency. Exclusivedata on multifragmentation on an event-by-event basis, which may helpthe model constructors, is presented as the second topic. In lecturethe onset of fragmentation, fragment sizes in multifragmentation processes,the origin of light particle correlations and emission of pions and kaonsclose to the threshold are discussed. 40 refs.; 14 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
