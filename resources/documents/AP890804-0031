One day after terrorists suspended a threatened death sentenceagainst hostage Joseph Cicippio, Bush told reporters, ``I wascertainly pleased that the brutal murder that had been threatenedwas set aside.   ``I don't know the total role of any individual country in thatarea in all of this but when you see a statement that offers hopefor the return of our hostages, I want to explore it to thefullest,'' the president said.   Bush answered several questions from reporters after posing forpictures in the Oval Office with Republican senators sponsoringlegislation to authorize a presidential line-item veto.   Iran's new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said during a weeklyprayer sermon today at Tehran University, ``These bullyings,arrogant approaches and tyranny will not solve the problems. Comelet us approach the problem reasonably. We too will help solve theproblems there, so the people of the region can live in peace andharmony.''   ``I tell the White House, the problem of Lebanon has solutions,the freeing of the hostages has solutions, reasonable, prudentsolutions,'' Rafsanjani said in a broadcast monitored in Nicosia,Cyprus.   Iran is thought to have strong influence over Shiite Moslemmilitants holding Americans captive.   While Bush called Rafsanjani's statement encouraging, WhiteHouse press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We're alwaysskeptical of what we hear'' from Iran.   Bush refused to confirm numerous reports that he had beenprepared to order retaliatory military action if Cicippio had beenkilled.   ``If I had made such a decision, I expect this would be the lastplace I'd be talking about it,'' he said.   Fitzwater, talking with reporters later, said emphatically thatBush had not made a final decision on military action. ``I talkedto the president about this very question before he came out, Iknow what he intended to say, I know what he said and I know whatthe truth is and I know he did not (make a final decision),'' thespokesman said.   Moreover, with hostages still in captivity, Fitzwater said, ``itis not helpful to be flexing our muscles in public.''   Bush said he had been engaged in ``an extroardinarily broadexercise of diplomacy'' over the last several days on behalf of thehostages. White House officials said he called upwards of a dozenworld leaders to seek their help.   As for the offer from Rafsanjani, Bush said, ``I am pleasedabout that. I don't know what it means fully, but I think the worldis familiar with our policy _ that there will be nothing done everthat will create a new incentive for taking somebody else hostage.   ``I feel the burden of going to every end possible to try tofind ... the return of these Americans to their loved ones and tofind out the truth about Col. (William) Higgins,'' a hostagereported hanged in Lebanon on Monday by kidnappers.   Asked if recent developments suggest a break in the hostagecrisis, Bush said, ``I'm encouraged but I don't want to get thehopes of the hostages' loved ones up once again to have those hopesdashed.   ``This is a brutal process where you see people paraded beforecameras and the families get their hopes up. My heart is still withMrs. Higgins.''   Noting that the United States is not absolutely sure thatHiggins is dead, Bush said, ``We can't tell her with any definitionwhat _ of her husband's fate.''   The president added, ``I don't want to raise hopes beyondfulfillment but there's reason to be somewhat encouraged.''   Asked what prompted the freeze on Cicippio's death sentence,Bush said, ``I like to think a broad-spread appeal to nations inevery corner of the globe had something to do with it. I don't knowfor sure. The response I have had on my personal calls and that thesecretary had on his has been heart warming. And it's come from allsectors and I have been very, very encouraged by that, and where wego from here, we'll just keep on trying.''   Asked if Cicippio deserved the full backing of the UnitedStates, in view of the fact that he ignored U.S. warnings to leaveLebanon, Bush acknowledged that, indeed, Americans had been urgednot to stay in that strife-torn country.   Even so, Bush said, ``he's an American. He's entitled to theconcern of the president, of these senators, of everybody in ouradministration.''   U.S. Navy units remained in readiness today as reportscirculated that Bush was prepared to use carrier-based aircraftfrom the 6th Fleet in a strike against Lebanese terrorists if anyAmerican hostages were harmed.   Television evangelist Robert Schuller, who prayed Thursday withBush in the Oval Office for hostages, said the president had ``madeit clear he would take appropriate action'' if another hostage waskilled.   The New York Times reported today that Bush had ``all butdecided'' to attack terrorist strongholds in eastern Lebanon,including the Baalbek base of 2,000 Iranian revolutionary guards,if a hostage had been killed.   A White House spokesman reached at home Thursday night, whospoke only on condition of anonymity, said, ``To my knowledge thatis not true,' but added, ``We just don't discuss those sorts ofthings.''   Cicippio's captors indicated he still could be killed ``withindays'' unless Israel releases unspecified Palestinian and Lebaneseguerrillas as well as the Moslem cleric kidnapped by Israelicommandos, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.   Asked Thursday if Bush would recall any ships, presidentialspokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``I urge everyone to keep in mind,especially in regard to the ships, that we still have a seriousproblem in the Middle East.''   Asked whether the United States was considering asking Israel toextradite Obeid for possible involvement in the kidnapping ofHiggins, Fitzwater said only that the Justice Department ``islooking into the case.''   A law enforcement source said the FBI is reviewing laws thatallow the arrest and prosecution of terrorists for the kidnappingand murder of U.S. citizens overseas.   Fitzwater said the president called at least a dozen leaders inthe Middle East and elsewhere over the past two days.</TEXT></DOC>
