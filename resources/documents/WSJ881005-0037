The vice president's television commercials convey a message of likeability and strength, while the TV spots for Democrat Michael Dukakis lack consistency and continuity, according to two political experts asked by The Wall Street Journal to evaluate the advertising campaigns.    John Deardourff, a GOP media expert who directed Gerald Ford's media campaign in 1976 and has advised countless other Republicans, and Greg Schneiders, a Democratic consultant and former top aide to Jimmy Carter, viewed more than a dozen commercials provided by the campaigns.    &quot;It's easier to infer the Bush strategy looking at all these commercials,&quot; Mr. Schneiders observes. &quot;It's more difficult to infer the Dukakis strategy. It's more reactive.&quot;    &quot;I get a clearer picture of what the Bush campaign is trying to say,&quot; says Mr. Deardourff. &quot;They're trying to convey a sense that the country is in good shape . . . and to change the public's perception of Bush.&quot;    The political consultants say the Bush ad campaign succeeds because it moves Mr. Bush more to the center of the political spectrum, and combines compassion and toughness to overcome many of the vice president's earlier &quot;negatives.&quot; By contrast, Messrs. Deardourff and Schneiders say the Dukakis ads overall are disjointed, though they say certain commercials are effective.    Curiously, these two media experts think that the role of political commercials, even on a $30 million budget, is exaggerated and that TV news coverage -- &quot;free media&quot; in campaign parlance -- probably plays a bigger role. Still, both believe that the campaign ads play an important part in shaping public perceptions.    Choosing from recently and currently aired commercials, Messrs. Schneiders and Deardourff easily decided which one they liked best from each campaign, and they picked the same ones. (Of course, the campaigns will release new ones in coming days.)    &quot;The Future.&quot; A blond-haired little girl runs across a field as George Bush says, &quot;I want a kinder and gentler nation.&quot; As the pictures switch to a cheering crowd at the Republican convention, an announcer says, &quot;It's the president who defines the character of a nation.&quot; The next sound is Mr. Bush's convention speech on family and values, and the pictures show the GOP nominee cooking in a crowded kitchen and at a picnic with several grandchildren hanging around his neck and sitting in his lap. He then sweeps a grandchild up in his arms and kisses her as the announcer says, &quot;The president -- the heart, the soul, the conscience of a nation.&quot;    &quot;These are absolutely beautiful pictures,&quot; says Mr. Deardourff. &quot;Here you get the sense of Bush as a warm and thoughtful person. But the whole spot has majesty about it.&quot; Adds Mr. Schneiders, &quot;You'd say this guy is likeable.&quot;    The screen flashes &quot;Leadership,&quot; and the announcer says, &quot;It's getting people to work together.&quot; The screen then shows Mr. Dukakis reaching down from a platform to grasp an outreached hand. It then flashes to a series of graphics on economic improvements attributed to Gov. Dukakis's leadership in Massachusetts under the caption &quot;The Dukakis record.&quot; It moves on to Mr. Dukakis walking through a crowd, and shaking a hand that won't let go of his and that pats his hand affectionately. It closes with flags in the wind, and the announcer intones, &quot;Michael Dukakis for president: Take charge of America's future.&quot;    &quot;Hands are a tool of the trade, and you have some wonderful shots here,&quot; says Mr. Deardourff. &quot;It is combined with a lot of information, and is visually well done -- although if you watched it ten times, you might laugh at all the hands touching.&quot; Mr. Schneiders likes this &quot;biographical&quot; ad as well, and compares it favorably to one that Ronald Reagan ran in 1980 on his California governorship.    The experts are critical of the other major Dukakis biographical ad, which states Mr. Dukakis's major actions as governor of Massachussetts while flashing several photographs of Mr. Dukakis at his desk.    &quot;This does nothing to change the impression of Dukakis as a loner; it says he's more comfortable alone at his desk,&quot; Mr. Deardourff says. &quot;It shows a guy with a cerebral interest in the issues; you see no passion or compassion.&quot; Both consultants are surprised that the Dukakis campaign used mostly sterile still photographs in their ads, although they both liked a shot of Mr. Dukakis joyfully holding a thumb up to the cheering crowd. &quot;That's a great picture,&quot; Mr. Deardourff says.    In addition to these &quot;feel good&quot; commercials, both campaigns are airing some negative-attack ads. By and large, the political pros didn't find these as effective. Both Messrs. Schneiders and Deardourff said a Democratic National Committee commercial titled &quot;Hey Pal&quot; was one of the worst commercials they've ever seen. To depict the deficit issue, it had an actor laughing grotesquely about billions of dollars of debt. They did, however, like an ad produced by the committee on the plant-closing issue and a Bush ad on crime.    Opening shot of locks on a gate to a plant which has just been closed down. The announcer says that Mr. Bush and Dan Quayle, his running mate, &quot;said no&quot; to 60-day notice of plant closings to workers, while Mr. Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen support advance notice. It closes with a question, &quot;Who cares about your life? The choice is clear.&quot; Flash to &quot;Dukakis-Bentsen.&quot;    Both praise this ad for its clean identification of an issue that matters to an audience targeted by the Democrats.    &quot;A Crime Quiz.&quot; This ad shows pictures of the candidates -- Mr. Bush's smiling face and Mr. Dukakis in a smug expression with one eye almost closed. It then asks questions like, &quot;Who gave weekend passes to murderers not even eligible for parole?&quot; Suddenly, the unflattering picture of Mr. Dukakis fills the screen. The last questions asks, &quot;Who can you really count on to be tough on crime?&quot; and ends with Mr. Bush and his smile.    &quot;This ad has a pretty clear message,&quot; says Mr. Schneiders. Mr. Deardourff likes its clean graphics that spell out the questions to reinforce what the announcer is saying.    The latest batch of negative commercials includes one the Bush campaign began airing last night, filmed in a prison, attacking Gov. Dukakis for his furlough program, and a Dukakis campaign series of four ads called &quot;The Packaging of George Bush.&quot; Messrs. Schneiders and Deardourff didn't get a chance to review the furlough program ad, but did see &quot;The Packaging of George Bush&quot; spots.    Four actors are playing campaign strategists for Mr. Bush. One says the Dukakis health-insurance plan is &quot;going to play real well with the middle class.&quot; &quot;So what does Bush do?&quot; asks another strategist. &quot;Wraps himself in the American flag.&quot; &quot;Not that again.&quot; &quot;Would you rather talk about Dukakis's health-insurance plan?&quot; To cynical laughter, one aide responds, &quot;Get out the flag boys.&quot; The announcer closes, &quot;They'd like to sell you a package. Wouldn't you rather choose a president?&quot;    &quot;This is way too subtle; it's late in the game for a subtle point,&quot; Mr. Schneiders says. Mr. Deardourff agrees that the commercial is too complicated. &quot;It took me 10 seconds before I realized it wasn't a Bush spot,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
