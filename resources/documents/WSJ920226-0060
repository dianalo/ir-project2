The bill, which the Senate approved by a 59-39 vote,cleared the House in November, so it next goes to the WhiteHouse. Mr. Bush announced this year his decision to renewChina's trade status unconditionally, so a presidential vetoand a battle to sustain the veto are distinct possibilities.</LP><TEXT>   The measure would bar the president from renewing China'sMFN status for another 12-month period after this June unlessChina improves its behavior on human rights, removes amultitude of barriers to U.S. exports and cooperates withWestern countries in preventing the proliferation oflong-range missiles and nuclear and chemical weapons.   Most-favored-nation status is the trade treatment the U.S.confers on nations with whom it is on good terms; mosttrading partners have that status.   In 1990, Mr. Bush's veto threat was enough to put offSenate action on the same measure, although the House hadapproved it 384-30. The odds are somewhat tougher for theWhite House this year. The House vote was an overwhelming409-21. Yesterday's winning Senate majority, although notveto-proof, was enlarged by votes from lawmakers worriedabout the impact on U.S. jobs of China's record $12.7 billiontrade surplus with the U.S. last year.   Majority Leader George Mitchell, the bill's prime mover inthe Senate, charged that Mr. Bush's policy of negotiating forpolitical reforms in China has failed. &quot;It is time for astronger policy,&quot; he said.   Minority Leader Robert Dole, insisting that China &quot;is onthe way to economic reform,&quot; led the debate for theadministration.   The bill's list of specific conditions is long, andprobably unacceptable to Beijing's hard-liners. The Chineseare being asked, among other things, to release nonviolentdissidents, end religious persecution in Tibet, and guaranteefreedom of assembly and of the media.   The bill also would set civil penalties of up to $1million for any person violating a longstanding U.S. lawagainst importing goods made with prison labor. Severalcongressmen suspect that some convict-made Chinese goods arelanding in the U.S. despite Beijing's claims to the contrary.   The administration has been pressing for reforms inChina's behavior, but it insists that stripping that countryof its most-favored-nation status would be the &quot;wronginstrument.&quot; A U.S. trade official called the legislation an&quot;undiscriminating blockbuster that hurts friends and foesalike.&quot;   The administration contends that loss ofmost-favored-nation status would be a &quot;body blow&quot; to HongKong, depriving it of the benefit of handling $4.6 billion inshipments of goods from China annually and turning much ofits investments in southern China sour.   The administration also warns that U.S. consumers wouldsuffer from a U.S. reversion to high tariffs on Chinese goodsthat date back to the protectionist 1930s. Withoutmost-favored-nation status, for instance, duties on Chinesefootwear would rise to 35% from 6%, duties on Chinesesweaters would jump to 60% from 6%, and those on Chinesestuffed toys would rise to 70% from 6.8%.   Before yesterday's vote, the Senate went into closedsession to hear an hourand-a-half intelligence briefing onChina.</TEXT></DOC>
