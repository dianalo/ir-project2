The followingrevisions were made as a result of reviewing comments received from thenotice. At Military Department request, a proposed provision was eliminatedthat would have authorized commanders with available funds to considerproposals to acquire automated teller machines. Provisions were clarifiedthat govern overseas Defense credit union fields of membership and limitationsin granting real estate loans. For purposes of qualifying for no-cost officespace and other real property under section 124 of the Federal Credit UnionAct, Defense credit unions now will be able to include retired militarypersonnel in the credit union's field of membership. A proposed provisionthat would have permitted installation commanders, on a one-time basis,to renegotiate existing fair market rental real property leases under newnominal rental provisions was limited to extensions of such leases. Finally,the revised rule accepts clarifying and editorial changes suggested inresponse to the notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>July 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Dr. R.

These credit unions shall provide servicesto DoD personnel of all ranks and grades within their respective fieldsof membership. (b) <T3>Limitation on service.</T3> (1) Only one credit union shall establisha branch or facility on a DoD installation, and its field of membershipnormally shall include all assigned DoD personnel. On installations wheremore than one credit union already exists, each is entitled to the benefitsdefined in this part. (2) Except as authorized in section G., appendix to this part, commandersof installations served by on-base credit unions shall ensure that installationactivities do not disseminate literature from competing credit unions.(c) <T3>Establishing domestic credit union service.</T3> (1) A demonstratedneed for credit union services may be addressed by establishing a new full-servicecredit union or by opening a branch office or facility of an existing creditunion under the common bond principle.(2) Each DoD Component shall develop internal instructions, consistentwith the following, that govern the submission and justification of requeststo establish credit unions on respective installations: (i) DoD personnel seeking to establish a new full-service credit unionor a branch or facility of an existing credit union shall submit a proposalto the installation commander. Such proposals shall be forwarded throughchannels to the DoD Component headquarters concerned, together with recommendationsfor acceptance or rejection. (ii) The DoD Component shall notify credit unions that operate on DoD installationsof the need for service; review the specific proposals of interested creditunions; coordinate with its field commands as appropriate; and recommendfor approval the designation of a credit union to the appropriate regulatoryagency, providing an information copy to the DC(MS). No specific NCUA approvalis required for a Federal credit union to open a branch office. (iii) No commitment may be made to a credit union regarding its proposaluntil the appropriate regulatory agency has announced a selection. (d) <T3>Establishing overseas credit union service. </T3>(1) When the installation(community) commander determines that credit union services are neededat a location within an existing geographic franchise (see subsection H.2.,appendix to this part), and the DoD Component headquarters concurs, thecommander shall contact the servicing Defense credit union and requestthat a branch or facility be established. The basic decision concerningsuch extensions of service rests with the servicing credit union. If afield of membership has not previously been granted by NCUA to encompassa DoD designated geographic franchise, the DoD Component shall canvassfederally-chartered Defense credit unions for proposals to service thesolicited region. (2) In addition to the requirements stated in paragraph (c)(2) of thissection, installation commanders shall provide the following informationin support of requests to their DoD Component headquarters for overseascredit union service: (i) In countries not presently served, a statement concurred in by theUnified Commander that the requirement has been coordinated with the U.S.Chief of Diplomatic Mission or U.S. Embassy and that the host country willpermit the operation, with any conditions imposed by the host country identified.(ii) The name and location of the nearest credit union branch or facility.(iii) The distance between the installation and the nearest credit unionbranch or facility and the availability of any official or public transportation.(iv) The number of DoD personnel in duty assignments that confine themto the installation, or who cannot obtain transportation (such as hospitalpatients). (3) In reviewing proposals received from Federal Defense credit unionsunder paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the DoD Component shall give preferenceto proposals for full-service credit union operations. After coordinationwith the DC(MS), the DoD Component shall recommend designation of the selectedcredit union to the NCUA.

This percentage criterion applies to thetotal credit union membership, not just to members who use the on-baseoffice. (ii) Before renewal of each no-cost lease or license, the credit unionshall provide a written certification, prepared on credit union letterheadand signed either by its president or general manager, that the creditunion continues to meet the 95 percent criterion. A certification alsois required whenever there is a merger, takeover, or significant changein a field of membership. This certification shall serve as justificationand documentation for the continued allocation of free Government officespace and other real property. (2) <T3>Criteria for use of space in Government-owned buildings.</T3> (i) Acredit union may be provided space on a DoD installation at one or morelocations by no-cost permits or licenses for periods not to exceed 5 years.The cumulative total of space authorized at one or more locations is subjectto the limitations contained in MIL-HDBK-1190. (ii) A credit union that fails to meet the 95 percent criterion shall becharged fair market rent for space provided. No credit union whose fieldof membership excludes any DoD personnel assigned on the installation shallreceive free Government space. This latter limitation is waived in caseswhen an installation is served by more than one credit union. (iii) All space assigned by the GSA, whether leased or in Federal officebuildings, is reimbursable to the GSA at the current GSA rental rates underPub. L. 92-313. Consequently, the GSA shall charge the benefiting DoD Componentfor any space assigned for credit union operations. Such space is thensubject to the provisions of paragraphs (h)(i) and (ii) of this section.(iv) When a credit union that meets the 95 percent criterion uses its ownfunds to expand, modify, or renovate Government-owned space, it may beprovided a no-cost permit or license for a period not to exceed 25 years.Duration of the permit or license shall be commensurate with the extentof the improvements as determined by the DoD Component concerned. It shallbe effective until the agreed date of expiration or until the credit unionceases to satisfy the 95 percent criterion. ln this latter case, the no-costpermit shall be cancelled in favor of a lease immediately negotiated atfair market value under the provisions of paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of thissection. If the credit union desires, this lease at fair market value mayextend through the period identified in the original license, or 5 years,whichever is greater. (v) Similarly, a credit union not meeting the 95 percent criterion thatuses its own funds to expand, modify, or renovate Government-owned space,may be provided a lease at the fair market value for a period not to exceed25 years.

Clearance involves reporting a change of address,reaffirming allotments or notes payable, and arranging for counseling,if appropriate. Clearance shall not be denied to facilitate the collectionof debts or the resolution of disputes between the credit union and itsdeparting members. Where administratively feasible, similar clearance proceduresshall be used for departing DoD civilian employees. (4) <T3>Additional support in overseas areas.</T3> In addition to the logisticsupport identified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (3) of this section, thefollowing may be made available to Defense credit unions operating at overseasinstallations: (i) Military postal service may be authorized, in accordance with DoD Directive4525.6\8\<NOTE/>.

However, an extensionof any such existing lease may provide for nominal rental, e.g., $1.00for the term of the lease extension. (2) When a credit union participates in the construction of a complex,such as an installation shopping mall, it shall be provided a lease atnominal rental covering only underlying land for the specific space tobe occupied by the credit union. (3) If determined, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2667, to be in the Government'sinterest, an existing lease of land may be extended before to expirationof its term. Passage of title to facilities shall be deferred until allextensions have expired. Such extensions shall be for periods not to exceed5 years. The credit union shall continue to maintain the premises and payfor utilities and services furnished in accordance with DoD Instruction7230.7.
