Closely held Gillett, Nashville, Tenn., with interests in broadcasting, publishing and real estate, had been a rumored suitor of the stations. SCI is the parent of Storer Communications Inc., which was taken private in 1985 in a $2.5 billion leveraged buyout led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., a New York investment concern.    Last year, a Kohlberg Kravis agreement to sell the six stations to Lorimar-Telepictures Corp., a Los Angeles-based entertainment concern, collapsed after the two parties couldn't agree on final terms of the $1.4 billion proposal.    Under a new proposed agreement, SCI would transfer the six stations to a new company that SCI and Gillett would jointly own, though Gillett would be the controlling shareholder, executives said.    An SCI spokesman declined to comment on the possible terms of the proposed venture with Gillett. But the spokesman said SCI is considering a transaction in part to reduce debt relating to the Storer leveraged buyout.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    SCI last year also sold some of its cable-TV systems and is planning separately to sell its Toledo, Ohio, station, WTVG, for $65 million to Terry Lee, chairman, president and chief executive officer of SCI Holdings, officials said.    The stations include WAGA-TV, Atlanta; WJW-TV, Cleveland; WJBK-TV, Detroit; WITI-TV, Milwaukee; KCST-TV, San Diego, and WSBK-TV, Boston. The first four stations are CBS affiliates, while KCST is an NBC affiliate and WSBK is independent. WTVG is also an NBC affilite.    The new venture also would operate Storer Television sales, an in-house advertising-placement operation; Storer's television-programming unit, and a Washington news bureau.    The six stations currently reach about 7.5% of the nation's 87.4 million homes with television sets. Gillett currently owns or has agreements to buy 14 other stations and will have to sell some of its stations under federal rules that limit broadcasting-property ownership to 12 television stations.    Broadcast-industry sources said that as part of the proposed transaction, Gillett also would have the right to buy Kohlberg Kravis's interest in the new venture if the investor group eventually decides to sell.    The price for Gillett's interest in the proposed new venture reflects continued high demand for network-affiliated stations, industry analysts said. Though prices for independent stations have softened in the weak national advertising environment, prices for affiliated stations remain strong, in part because so few of them come up for sale. Last month, Gillett and a partner agreed to buy a Tampa, Fla., station for about $365 million.    George Gillett, chairman of Gillett, said he expects a formal agreement on the SCI venture to be signed within the next few weeks.    Any sale of interests in the stations would require approval of the Federal Communications Commission. </TEXT></DOC>
