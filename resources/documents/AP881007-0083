In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called thereport ``not true.''   The unattributed report in The Nation, an English-languageweekly that began publishing last month, said the U.S. governmentagreed to pay $7 million in ransom to the Lebanese Shiite Moslemextremists holding most of the hostages but refused the group'sdemands for immunity from prosecution.   The United States has denied reports it is involved innegotiations with Iran over the release of hostages.   Fitzwater today said he consulted with the national securityadviser, Colin Powell, about the story, and Powell said there wereno such weapons transfers.   ``There are a lot of free-lancers, independent operators in theregion,'' the spokesman said. But he reiterated administrationstatements that none of these independent parties is authorized tospeak for the U.S. government.   The report in The Nation said the U.S. refusal to guaranteeimmunity from prosecution angered the kidnappers and prompted themto release Indian hostage Mithileshwar Singh on Monday instead ofAlann Steen, a U.S. citizen whose release had been expected.   According to The Nation, among the steps taken to secure therelease of a foreign hostage was an agreement by South Korea tosell millions of dollars in spare parts for U.S.-made weapons.   The newspaper said that two weeks before the release of Singh,who is a permanent U.S. resident, South Korean Oil Minister LeeBong signed an agreement in Tehran to sell the spare parts,including those needed for the U.S.-made F-5 aircraft used in theIranian air force.   The Reagan administration would have had to approve such a saleunder the standard agreement signed by countries licensed tomanufacture U.S-designed weapons, the newspaper said.   Today's report also said U.S. citizens who hold Iranian andLebanese passports visited two of the hostages in January,including Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press. Anderson, the longest held hostage, was kidnappedMarch 16, 1985.   Reporter Giora Shamis told The Associated Press the report inThe Nation was based on interviews with three of about 15 dualpassport holders involved in the contacts as well as South Koreansources who confirmed an Iranian report about the spare parts deal.   Shamis is an owner of the London-based news service, Depth,which sold the story to The Nation.   According to the report, Iran agreed to put up the $7 millionransom for the hostages because the United States did not want toappear to be directly purchasing their freedom.   The newspaper said the money would be paid indirectly to thekidnappers by Iran in the form of commissions for Iranian purchasesin the United States. These are to be channeled through Lebaneseand Iranian businessmen to Hezbollah, the radical Shiite groupbelieved to be holding hostages.   Sixteen foreign hostages are believed held in Lebanon, includingnine Americans.</TEXT></DOC>
