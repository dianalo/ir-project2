Macy andamp; Co. has proposed a merger withFederated Department Stores Inc. with an indicated value of about$6.6 billion, apparently topping a rival $6.1 billion offer fromToronto-based Campeau Corp., Federated said late Monday night.   The offer from Macy's was disclosed as Federated's boardconsidered a $68 a share negotiated offer from Campeau for all ofFederated's 89.6 million common shares outstanding.   Privately-held Macy's would make a cash tender offer forapproximately 80 percent of Federated's outstanding shares at$73.80 per share, Federated said.   Federated shares not purchased in the tender offer would beexchanged in a merger transaction, for a number of newly issuedshares of Macy's common stock, equal to approximately 40 percent ofthe unpurchased shares.   No value immediately could be placed on the stock portion of thebuyout offer, but the total offer would be worth about $6.6 billionif valued at $73.80 in cash or stock for all of Federated's shares.   The Federated board took no action on the Campeau bid butdirected its management and advisers to investigate Macy'sproposals, to negotiate a definitive agreement and submit bothnegotiated agreements to the board as soon as possible, the companystated.   Federated officials did not know when the board would get theproposals, according to spokeswoman Carol Sanger.   The board of directors of the merged company, which would berenamed Macy's-Federated Inc., would include significantrepresentation from the existing Federated board, Federated said.   Macy's management and financial adivisers spoke at the boardmeeting in New York, Federated said.   Macy's offices in New York were closed when Federated announcedthe proposal late Monday, and a spokesman could not be reached forcomment.   The Macy's proposal was subject to execution of a definitivemerger agreement, and to approval by the boards of directors andstockholders of both companies. A number of Macy's outsidedirectors already have participated in the deliberations, withrespect to the combination, Ms. Sanger said.   Macy's was taken private in a $3.6 billion management leveragedbuyout in 1986. Its stockholders and directors include A. AlfredTaubman, a major shopping mall developer, and Laurence A. Tisch,chief executive of CBS Inc. and Loews Corp.   The company is one of the nation's biggest and best knownretailers, with $5.21 billion in sales during the year ended lastAug. 1.   Macy's operates 100 department stores and recently opened threespecialty clothing stores.   Cincinnati-based Federated is a $10.5 billion diversifiedretailer with more than 650 department stores, supermarkets andother retail outlets nationwide.</TEXT><TEXT>   Federated's retail operations include the Bloomingdale's,Filene's, Burdine's, Lazarus, Bullock's and Gold Circle storechains.   Macy's has indicated its financial advisers, Drexel BurnhamLambert and Kidder Peabody Inc. were confident they could privatelyplace $1.8 billion in senior subordinated debt to finance thetransaction, Federated said. Bankers Trust Co. and ManufacturersHanover Trust Co. have agreed conditionally to arrange the balanceof the financing.   Federated had announced earlier that its board was considering athird-party proposal that was competitive with Campeau's offer.   A Campeau spokeswoman declined earlier Monday to comment on thelast-minute bid, although Campeau repeatedly has stated it wantedthe opportunity to meet competing offers.   Federated stock closed up $2 at $66.50 a share in New York StockExchange trading Monday.   The Federated board, after rejecting three alternative, hostiletender offers from Campeau, announced Friday it had authorizedmerger negotiations with the Toronto-based retailing and realestate company.   In addition to the Campeau proposal, Federated's board had beenconsidering whether to entirely shun purchase offers in favor of arestructuring that woudl keep present management in control.   Campeau, which acquired giant Allied Stores Corp. in December1986, has been pressing its takeover attempt since Jan. 25.   Some industry analysts have said they expect Federated tocontinue soliciting other buyers to fend off Campeau's overtures.</TEXT></DOC>
