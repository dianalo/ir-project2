A less radical draft treaty presented by Luxembourg lastJune will serve as the framework for negotiations onpolitical union. This lifted the recent sense of crisis forthe talks on greater EC political integration to expand itsrole globally.   The treaty is intended to give the European Parliament newpowers, streamline EC decision making and create a moreunified foreign and security policy structure. The Dutch plancame close to outlining a European superstate, raisingconcerns about sovereignty.   Separately, the EC agreed on trade concessions forCzechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, smoothing the way forthem to become associate members. The compromise move, tomonitor Eastern European export limits and divert many foodexports to the Soviet union, assuaged France's fears ECfarmers would be hurt.                                                                                                          BRITAIN'S LABOR SETS STANCE                                                                                                          Britain's Labor Party, setting economic policies based onpragmatic socialism, vowed at its national convention to taxthe wealthy to help the poor if it wins national electionsthat must be held by July. But delegates of the mainopposition party rejected reviving a pledge to renationalizethe utility industry, holding to the centrist platform thatis threatening the Tories' 12-year rule. The two parties arerunning even in opinion polls. Labor also would increasechild benefits and pensions and introduce a minimum wage.                                                                                                          JAPAN'S FAIR-TRADE OVERSIGHT                                                                                                          Japan's Fair Trade Commission said it would strengthen itssurveillance of industry associations to ensure they don'tlimit competition. The FTC seeks funding for the fiscal yearstarting April 1 to conduct a comparative study of industryassociations in Japan, the U.S. and the European Community.The agency also said it would try to ensure that productstandards set by industry associations don't prove to beobstacles to outsiders.                                                                                                          MANILA'S BACKING FOR EXPORTERS                                                                                                          The Philippine government resumed extending repaymentguarantees on borrowings of small and medium-sized exporters.Manila will manage the new two billion peso ($75.5 million)export financing guarantee. Its guarantees on exporters'loans collapsed in the early 1980s after unpaid obligationspiled up.                                                                                                          INVESTORS SHY ON SRI LANKA                                                                                                          Dissent in Sri Lanka's government, already facing armedrebellion, weakened the economy and scared off foreigninvestment, officials said. After calls in Parliament in lateAugust for presidential impeachment over corruptionallegations and demands in September for a no-confidence votebecause of claims the president had armed rebels, businessplans were put on hold. Foreign investment, which untilAugust had been running ahead of last year's levels, plungedfollowing the allegations.                                                                                                          ATHENS AIR POSES DANGER                                                                                                          Air pollution in Athens, Greece, surpassed human-healthdanger levels, and the government plans to consider emergencymeasures, such as temporarily banning cars from the capital'scenter. On warm, still days, a brown cloud known as nefosoften forms over the city of about four million people, andyesterday, temperatures were in the 90s.                                                                                                          FOREIGN-AID DONOR TALLY                                                                                                          When the Development Assistance Committee of foreign-aiddonor nations unveils its annual tally of membercontributions today, the U.S. again will be No. 1. But adispute about military-debt forgiveness shows Japan's newassertiveness on global aid and investment issues.   The U.S., after being overtaken by Japan in 1989,reclaimed its position as the world's largest aid donor in1990, with official development assistance totaling $11.37billion, up from $7.68 billion in 1989, the Paris-based DAC'sfigures indicate. Japan was No. 2 at $9.07 billion, up from$8.97 billion in 1989.   Much of the reversal stemmed from currency fluctuations,and Japan's outlays came to 0.31% of its gross nationalproduct, compared with only 0.21% for the U.S. Both countrieslagged behind the 18-country DAC average of 0.35%. But Japanis irked because the U.S. was allowed to include in its totalabout $1.2 billion in forgiven military-debt payments.   Japan, which doesn't export arms or give developingnations credits for buying them, says military aid doesn'tcontribute to economic development. The U.S. says forgivingany debt makes that sum available for development.

In an effort to court Japanese investors, Germany'sTreuhandanstalt agency, which is selling former East Germanstate-owned assets, opened a representative office in Tokyo.. . . More than six in 10 Japanese husbands in their 40s aretoo lazy to help in shopping, preparing meals, clearing thetable and making beds, leaving the chores to their wives,according to a government survey of 200 middle-aged couples.</TEXT></DOC>
