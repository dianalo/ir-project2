Carluccisaid he and his Soviet counterpart briefly debated the reportedNicaraguan incursion into Honduras today before concluding threedays of talks on an upbeat note.   Carlucci said he protested the incursion to Soviet DefenseMinister Dmitri Yazov, who ``made some attempt to defend theSandinista action.''   ``I would not characterize it as a vigorous defense,'' Carluccitold a news conference before leaving Bern for Washington.   Carlucci said he consulted with the White House overnight andendorsed the decision to send an emergency U.S. force to Hondurason exercises.   The Sandinistas said they had chased Contra rebels to theHonduran border, but the Nicaraguan defense ministry deniedSandinista troops entered Honduras.   The Soviet Union provides Nicaragua with military and economicaid. At a news conference, Yazov did not address the issue ofNicaragua specifically.   ``We spoke out in favor of greater predictability and stabilityin the Soviet-U.S. military balance,'' he said. ``We tried tobetter understand the logic of and rationale for U.S. actions inthe military field.''   Carlucci described his talks with Yazov, which were closed toreporters, as ``cordial and businesslike'' and said he had beeninvited to Moscow to continue the discussions at an unspecifieddate.   He said he had not obtained the apology he requested for thefatal shooting by a Soviet soldier of U.S. Army Maj. ArthurNicholson in East Germany three years ago. Yazov said the incidentoccurred before he became defense minister last May, said Carlucci.   ``He said he would undertake to investigate it'' through theSoviet Foreign Ministry, which has been handling the issue Carluccisaid.   To avoid such ``dangerous activities,'' Carlucci said, ``Gen.Yazov and I agreed that more would be done in this area.''   Both agreed that ``there is no need for shooting,'' saidCarlucci. ``Gen. Yazov was firm on that.''   Carlucci said the chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff,Adm. William Crowe, and the Soviet Chief of Staff, Marshal SergeiAkhomeyev, would meet soon, probably in Washington, to work outguidelines to prevent friction between U.S. and Soviet ground, airand sea, forces.   Yazov repeated Kremlin assurances that Soviet troops would bewithdrawn from Afghanistan, but was unable to set a timetable,pending the outcome of stalled peace talks in Geneva, said Carlucci.   The two sides also discussed space-based missile defense,negotiations to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals, and regionalconflicts, including Angola, Cambodia and Korea, he said.   The Soviets proposed an experiment of a new method ofdetermining the presence of nuclear-tipped, sea-launched cruisemissiles aboard vessels, a technique mentioned last December byKremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev but never explained to the West.   Carlucci expressed doubt about the technique, but said theUnited States was willing to review the propsed experiment, detailsof which were not available.   The Soviets want to impose a limit on such weapons as part ofthe Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty now under negotiation.</TEXT></DOC>
