A boisterous crowd of colorfully clad deadheads _ the group'slegion of devoted fans _ seemed in shock several times during thealmost six-hour concert Saturday night at packed Madison SquareGarden.   While the band, an icon of the psychedelic 1960s, has playedbenefits before, they called this show the first act in a lifetimecommitment to the rain forest issue.   Some fans were surpised to hear the Dead push a cause.   But a real blow was the labored singing of lead guitarist JerryGarcia, whose ragged, cracking voice showed the exhaustion ofending a three-week East Coast tour with nine shows in 11 nights inNew York.   Overshadowing those anomalies, though, was the participation ofother popular musicians.   Bruce Hornsby and the Range kicked off the show with anenergetic 75-minute set. Hornsby also joined the Dead for a jam on``Not Fade Away.''   Former Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor accompanied the Deadfor two songs, trading leads with Garcia on ``West L.A. Fadeaway''and the blues standard, ``Little Red Rooster.''   Folksinger Suzanne Vega also performed.   But the real high point came when Daryl Hall and John Oates cameon stage, bouncing like jumping beans in the midst of thealways-placid Garcia and rhythm guitarist Bob Weir.   The musicians launched into an energetic ``Everytime You GoAway,'' with Oates singing the lead and Hall providing falsettoaccompaniments. Garcia stood to the side, laying down lead runsduring appropriate intervals but generally looking confused.   Marvin Gaye's ``What's Going' On,'' written in the early '70s atthe height of the ecology movement, also got an enthusiasticresponse from the audience.   Another highlight was bass player Phil Lesh's enthusiasticrendition of the Dead classic ``Box of Rain.''   The group also unveiled a banner from the rafters of the Garden.Decorated in the tie-dyed colors favored by Deadheads and bearingthe number 25, it represented the 25 shows the band has played inthe Garden, the most by any rock group.   For the finale, Hornsby, Hall and Oates and bass player JackCasady, formerly of Jefferson Airplane and Hot Tuna, joined in``Good Lovin'' and Bob Dylan's ``Knockin' on Heaven's Door.''   Throughout the night, performers and video messages remindedpatrons who paid up to $250 a seat about the cause.   Tropical rain forests are lush jungles located near the equator,primarily in South and Central America, Africa and Southeast Asia.According to the National Academy of Sciences, rain forests cover 7percent of the globe and contain 5 million to 30 million species ofplants, animals and insects.   Environmentalists and scientists contend that deforestation _through cattle ranching, farming, timber harvesting and landdevelopment _ contributes to the global warming trend known as thegreenhouse effect. It is caused by increased carbon dioxide in theatmosphere that traps heat, similar to glass in a greenhouse.Scientists say that left unchecked, it would melt the polar icecaps, causing ocean levels to rise.   Rain forests absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen throughphotosynthesis.   Leaflets distributed at the show urged people to writepoliticians, foreign leaders and financial institutions in a pleato halt projects that destroy rain forests.   Proceeds from the show, expected to exceed $600,000, were to bedistributed among environmental groups, including the RainforestAction Network, Cultural Survival and Greenpeace International.</TEXT></DOC>
