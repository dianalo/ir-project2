The team of observers representing the administration willconsist of Congress members, administration officials and privatesector leaders, but would be distinct from other privatelyorganized efforts to monitor Sunday's balloting, said the sources,who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The membership of the administration's group is not firm yet.   In addition to the team that will represent the administration,the government is encouraging private observer missions in hopes ofturning a bright spotlight on what U.S. officials have flatlypredicted will be an election rigged by Panama's ruler, Gen. ManuelNoriega.   Recent days have seen a flurry of policy meetings among WhiteHouse, State Department and military officials to determine whatactions should be taken before the election and what stance theadministration should adopt toward Panama afterward, sources said.   ``All of the options are ones that involve high costs,'' in thesense of political and international impact, said one official whodeclined to specify the options.   The deliberations come as officials continue to refuse commenton a U.S. News andamp; World Report article last week that said Bushsigned a secret order authorizing the CIA to funnel $10 million inassistance to Noriega's political opposition.   Officials said only that pre-election actions have beendiscussed.   But with the administration predicting Noriega will steal theelection for his presidential candidate, Carlos Alberto Duque, thefocus is increasingly on how Bush should react after the balloting.   Bush has said he will not accommodate Noriega, who was indictedin February 1988 by a Miami grand jury on drug trafficking charges.   The president last week accused Noriega of trying to commit``systemic fraud'' in the election and said the United States wouldnot recognize his fraudulent election results.   U.N. Ambassador Thomas Pickering on Friday accused Panama'sgovernment of blatantly manipulating voter lists; muzzling theopposition, press and TV; and restricting access by impartialforeign monitors and journalists.   Panama says the United States is meddling in its elections andfunnelling millions of dollars to the opposition campaigns.   Noriega's staying power raises questions about how the UnitedStates will act to protect the thousands of military and civilianAmericans who live in the Canal Zone, whether it will step uppressure on allies to isolate Noriega, and how it will move forwardon the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties.   Under the treaties, the United States is to turn over theAmerican-built canal to Panamanian control on Dec. 31, 1999.   A closer issue will be choosing a Panamanian director of thecanal. Panama's president can make a recommendation, but Bush andCongress are charged with actually appointing the individual bynext January.   For Sunday's elections, the State Department is helping organizea range of U.S. and foreign observer efforts besides the officialU.S. government team.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III himself telephoned formerPresidents Carter and Ford and urged them to be observers, sourcessaid.   Carter will lead a group organized by the non-profit NationalDemocratic Institute for International Affairs, and Ford has beeninvited to join them, said Ken Wollack, the group's executive vicepresident. The team is co-sponsored by the National RepublicanInstitute for International Affairs, and will consist of U.S. andforeign leaders, Wollack said. The observer mission received$100,000 in funding from Congress.   In addition, the Washington-based Center for Democracy office,which monitored the 1986 Philippines elections, has organizers inPanama arranging for another observer team of political leaders andCongress members.   The U.S. government recognizes the exiled Eric Arturo Delvalle,who had tried to oust Noriega, as the legitimate president ofPanama.   Bush has extended a trade ban the Reagan administration imposedagainst Panama.</TEXT></DOC>
