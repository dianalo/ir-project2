Background.</ITAG>FAC 84-40, Item I. (Interim Rule)In order for Federal agencies to comply with the Internal Revenue Service(IRS) reporting requirements, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)Subpart 4.9, Information Reporting to the IRS, and corresponding coveragein Part 52 have been developed to provide for contractors to submit theirtaxpayer identification number (TIN) and certain related information tothe appropriate contracting office.26 U.S.C. 6041 and 6041A, in part, as implemented in 26 CFR, require payors,including the Federal Government, to report to the IRS certain paymentsmade to contractors. Information required to be reported includes companyname, address, TIN, and corporate status. Failure or refusal to furnishthe TIN may result in a 20 percent reduction of payments otherwise dueunder the contract.26 U.S.C. 6050M, as implemented in 26 CFR, requires head of Federal Executiveagencies to report certain contract information to the IRS. The informationrequired to be reported for certain contract actions over $25,000 includesname, address, and TIN of contractor; name and TIN of common parent (ifany); date of contract action; amount obligated on the contract; and estimatedcontract completion date.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Determination to Issue an Interim Rule</ITAG>FAC 84-40, Item IA determination has been made under authority of the Secretary of Defense(DoD), the Administrator of General Services (GSA), and the Administratorof the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to issue theregulations in Item I of FAC 84-40 as an interim rule. This action is necessarybecause_(a) The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), on July 29, 1988, published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 28669) a proposed rule, with a 30-daycomment period, implementing the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6050M;(b) It is anticipated that the IRS final rule will be published in thenear future; and(c) In order for Federal Executive agencies to be prepared to comply withthe statutory requirements to be implemented in the anticipated IRS finalrule, it is necessary to establish procedures for collection of the requiredtaxpayer identification information in advance of the IRS final rule.DoD, GSA, and NASA have determined that compelling reasons exist to promulgatean interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. However,pursuant to Pub. L. 98-577 and FAR 1.501, public comments received in responseto this interim rule will be considered in formulating a final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction act</ITAG>FAC 84-40, Item IThe Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511) is deemed to apply becausethe interim rule contains an information collection requirement. Accordingly,a request for approval of a new information collection requirement concerningInformation Reporting to the Internal Revenue Service has been submittedto the Office of Management and budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, <T3>et seq.</T3> Public comments concerning this OMB clearance requestwere invited through a October 5, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice (53 FR 39128).FAC 84-40, Items II through XVIIThe Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511) does not apply because thesefinal rules do not impose any reporting or recordkeeping requirements orcollection of information from offerors, contractors, or members of thepublic which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">D. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>FAC 84-40, Item IThis interim rule is not expected to have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq</T3>., because all taxpayers are required to have a TaxpayerIdentification Number (TIN) and this rule merely requests contractors toprovide that number. Contractors should have immediate knowledge of thisinformation item, making any significant additional effort unnecessary.An Initial Regulatory Flexibility analysis has, therefore, not been prepared.Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties.Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will alsobe considered in accordance with Section 610 of the Act. Such commentsmust be submitted separately and cite FAR Case 88-610 in correspondence.FAC 84-40, Items II, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, XI, XIII, XV, XVI, and XVIIThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) does not apply becauseeach revision is not a ``significant revision'' as defined in FAR 1.501-1;i.e., it does not alter the substantive meaning of any coverage in theFAR having a significant cost or administrative impact on contractors orofferors, or a significant effect beyond the internal operating proceduresof the issuing agencies. Accordingly, and consistent with section 1212of Pub. L. 98-525 and section 302 of Pub. L. 98-577 pertaining to publicationof proposed regulations (as implemented in FAR Subpart 1.5, Agency andPublic Participation), solicitation of agency and public views on the revisionsis not required. Since such solicitation is not required, the RegulatoryFlexibility Act does not apply.FAC 84-40, Item IIIDoD, GSA, and NASA certify that the final rule will not have a significanteconomic impact upon a substantial number of small entities within themeaning of the Regulatory Flexibility act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq. </T3>The rule does not change current FAR requirements regardingsynopsizing solicitations for Randamp;D requirements. It merely clarifiesand makes optional the synopsizing of advance notices of interest in Randamp;Dfields.FAC 84-40, Item IVDoD, GSA, and NASA certify that this final rule will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq</T3>.). However, a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis hasbeen prepared and will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy ofthe Small Business Administration.FAC 84-40, Item XIt is expected that this final rule will have a significant impact on asubstantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act(5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq</T3>.). A Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been preparedand will be submitted to the chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small BusinessAdministration.FAC 84-40, Item XIIDoD, GSA, and NASA certify that the final rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaningof the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq.</T3> The rule does not impose any new requirements on contractors,large or small, and serves only to clarify existing regulatory coverageconcerning protest procedures.FAC 84-40, Item XIVThis rule will apply to all small businesses performing under Governmentcontracts that provide for the furnishing of Government property. Approximatelyfifty thousand small businesses hold Government contracts. While the numberof small businesses being furnished Government property under these contractsis unknown, the ultimate impact on small businesses should be minimal.The problem with dual property systems exists primarily with large contractors.Small businesses normally maintain only one property control system fortheir own and Government property. Comments regarding the Initial RegulatoryFlexibility Act Analysis were solicited in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 7, 1987 (52 FR 37595). No public commentswere received. A Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been preparedand submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy for the Small BusinessAdministration.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Public Comments</ITAG>FAC 84-40, Item IIIOn November 5, 1987, a proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 42519). The comments that were receivedwere considered by the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the DefenseAcquisition Regulatory Council in the development of this final rule.FAC 84-40, Item XOn October 14, 1987, an interim rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 38188). Over 35 public comments were receivedaddressing a number of issues including Subcontracting Limitations, FairProportion by Industry, and Fair Market Price. The comments that were receivedwere considered by the Councils in the development of this final rule.FAC 84-40, Item XIIOn November 25, 1986, a proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 42805). The Comments that were receivedwere considered by the Councils in the development of this final rule.FAC 84-40, Item XIVOn October 7, 1987, a proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 37595). The comments that were receivedwere considered by the Councils in the development of this final rule andthe change made to FAR 45.505(c) was made for clarification only.<ITAG tagnum="85">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 4, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 19, 25, 28,33, 36, 37, 45, 52, and 53</ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 19, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Harry S.
