Radical students and dissidents fought police in the city's mainshopping district, tearing chunks of concrete from sidewalks andpelting riot troopers with firebombs that burst in orange blasts ofblazing gasoline.   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan! Overthrow (President) Roh Tae-woo!''protesters shouted.   Police had no figures on arrests or injuries, but officers andprotesters were seen with blood pouring from head wounds and otherinjuries. Some police and protesters were brutally beaten afterbeing caught by the other side.   Violence broke out when more than 2,000 people tried to march tothe Blue House presidential mansion after a rally at MyongdongCathedral.   Dissident leaders announced at the rally the formation of a newalliance to push for Chun's arrest and the overthrow of Roh.Speakers said Chun could not be brought to justice while the Rohgovernment is in place.   Riot police blocked the marchers with shields. Students with ironbars and wooden clubs attacked police but were driven off bytear-gas grenades.   Hundreds of protesters regrouped several blocks away and attackedpolice with firebombs. Police cleared the main streets severaltimes, but protesters repeatedly surged from backstreets and drovethe troopers back.   Terrified people, many of them out Christmas shopping, fled asfirebombs and tear-gas grenades exploded around them. Riot policechasing protesters hurled tear-gas grenades into subway stations.   The protest was much smaller than three major violent protests inSeoul last month to demand Chun's arrest for alleged corruption andhuman rights abuses during his seven years in office.   In another protest today, four Buddhist monks and 14 radicalstudents clashed with police several hundred yards from the remoteBuddhist temple on the east coast where Chun is in exile. The formerpresident went into exile after publicly apologizing for abusescommitted during his seven-year rule.   The South Korean news agency Yonhap said fighting began whenpolice stopped protesters trying to approach the temple. Studentsand police fought with clubs and six people were injured, Yonhapsaid.   Opposition leaders accused Roh of delaying action against Chunand repeated demands that the former president cooperate with theNational Assembly probe of misdeeds under his rule.   Kim Dae-jung, who heads South Korea's main opposition group, theParty for Peace and Democracy, charged Roh with ``moving backward.''   Another opposition leader, Kim Young-sam, urged Roh toimmediately remove all vestiges of the Chun era and take``tangible'' measures such as releasing all political prisoners.   Roh asked the nation to forgive Chun after the former presidentapologized and went into internal exile.   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in1980, stepped down in February at the end of a seven-year term. Roh,another ex-general, won presidential elections last December.</TEXT></DOC>
