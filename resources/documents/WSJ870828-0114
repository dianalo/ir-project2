The company said earnings for the quarter will be only &quot;slightly higher&quot; than year-earlier net income of $45.1 million, or a restated 42 cents a share, on sales of $289.1 million.    Analysts had predicted that per-share earnings would be 47 cents to 52 cents a share for the third quarter. But Paul Duncan, the company's chief financial officer, said share net will be between 42 and 47 cents.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Reebok shares fell 12.5 cents, to close at $22.375.    Though the company hopes to speed up shipments in the fourth quarter, sales for the year also will be slightly lower than expected, Mr. Duncan said. The company has a backlog of more than $520 million, compared with $390 million at the same time last year. </TEXT></DOC>
