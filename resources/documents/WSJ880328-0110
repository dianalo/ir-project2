Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has criticized the other two elements of the so-called strategic triad: the B-1 bomber and the MX land-based missile. But he praised the Navy for delivering the Trident II on time and within budget.    &quot;Of all the strategic weapons systems that we've looked at, we've given this one the highest marks,&quot; Rep. Aspin said. The Wisconsin Democrat added that a deluge of reports -- many from his committee -- about troubled weapons creates &quot;the overall impression that none of this stuff works.&quot;    The success of the Trident II makes it the cornerstone of the U.S. nuclear deterrent. The weapon is being mounted in Trident submarines, which Navy analysts consider the world's quietest and hardest to detect. In addition, the eight-warhead missiles carry guidance systems allowing them to strike Soviet targets precisely.    The House Armed Services Committee has sharply criticized the two other strategic systems fielded by the administration. The B-1 bombers were delivered with several technical problems, the most serious being troubles in the electronic-countermeasures equipment needed to jam enemy radar. The MX, meanwhile, is deployed in ground-based silos that are vulnerable to attack and has had problems with its guidance system.    Air Force officials have repeatedly defended the performance of both systems and contend that Rep. Aspin has exaggerated their shortcomings. However, they admit that the B-1's electronic equipment needs more work and that some MX missiles weren't tested properly.    The Trident II has fared better mainly because of smarter management, Rep. Aspin said. He said officials assigned to the project have served six-year stints before being transferred to other jobs. The House panel also found that the Navy rewarded employees who discovered and reported problems with the missile's production. &quot;The Navy management of the program created a no-cover-up culture,&quot; he said.    Rep. Aspin said that although these management techniques seem basic, most large weapons programs don't employ them. Still, he said recent surveys have found that cost overruns on weapons are dropping. He said weapons currently exceed predicted costs by 35%, down from 55% a decade ago. </TEXT></DOC>
