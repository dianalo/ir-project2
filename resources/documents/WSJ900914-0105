Officials of the Canadian Auto Workers union werecontinuing to meet with Ford officials last night, but unioninsiders asserted that there wasn't any chance a new contractcould be put together before the strike deadline. A Fordspokesman was more upbeat, but said reaching any agreement atthis point would require &quot;damn hard work.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   A walkout by Ford's Canadian employees would idle nine ofthe company's plants in Canada. It also could hurt importantFord operations in the U.S., which depend on partsmanufactured in Canada. Ford officials predict a shortage ofengines and auto glass from Canada would result in severalU.S. operations closing within two weeks of a strike.   The union began contract negotiations last week afterselecting Ford as a strike target. Under the usual system ofpattern bargaining, any contract reached at Ford will serveas the basis for subsequent negotiations with the Canadiansubsidiaries of General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.Current contracts at each of the Big Three auto makers, whichcover a total of 61,000 employees in Canada, expire today.   Ford has made just one contract offer since the talksbegan. That offer, covering such economic issues as wages,vacations and cost-of-living allowances, was swiftly rejectedby the union, which contended that the company wasn'toffering nearly enough money. Even if Ford should returnbefore the strike deadline with a mutually acceptable packageof economic terms, there remain such time-consuming issues tobe resolved as health and safety in the plants and medicalbenefits.   A Canadian strike would hit some of Ford's most profitablemodel lines. The company's St. Thomas, Ontario, plant is thesole source for the large Mercury Grand Marquis and FordCrown Victoria models.   Ford's Windsor, Ontario, engine plant builds thesix-cylinder unit for the Lincoln Continental luxury car. Alengthy shutdown could hobble operations at the highlyprofitable Wixom, Mich., plant that builds the Continental,as well as the Lincoln Town Car and Lincoln Mark VII. TheWindsor plant also builds many of the engines for Ford'sU.S.-built Taurus and Sable midsized cars.   Another Ford plant, in Niagara Falls, Ontario, is the soleprovider of auto glass to four of the company's light-truckassembly operations in the U.S. A total of about 80% ofFord's Canadian output is exported to the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
