(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A lawyer for Jim Bakker today said``electronic ministry'' itself is on trial after the TV evangelist'sfirst court appearance since his indictment on charges of defraudingPTL contributors.   U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor set unsecured bond of $50,000 forBakker and three former aides, and scheduled a court appearance forBakker and Richard Dortch on Jan. 17, when they will enter pleas tofraud and conspiracy charges.   The defrocked PTL leader and one-time aides are accused ofdiverting more than $5 million in contributions to the evangelicalempire in order to live in luxury. Bakker's wife, Tammy, did notaccompany him today; she was not indicted.   ``I am not guilty of these charges and I'm looking forward to dueprocess taking place. If I get a fair trial, we can win this case,''Bakker said after court.   ``Bakker is not the only one on trial,'' his attorney George T.Davis said. ``His wife is on trial and the whole ministry _ theelectronic ministry _ is on trial. ''   Bakker, Dortch and David and James Taggart were indicted Dec. 5after a 16-month federal grand jury investigation of PTL's financesbefore Bakker left the evangelical empire in a sex and money scandal.   Dortch is Bakker's former top deputy. David Taggart is Bakker'sformer personal aide and James Taggart PTL's one-time interiordecorator.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller told Taylor today that noadditional charges were expected against Bakker and Dortch.   The Taggarts pleaded innocent today to charges of tax evasion.They are accused of using more than $1.1 million in PTL money forpersonal expenditures. Taylor tentatively scheduled their trial forthe last week of January.   Jim Toms, another Bakker attorney, said he does not expect hisclient to enter a plea until next month. Toms said previously thatBakker would plead innocent.   Bakker, 48, resigned in 1987 amid revelations he had a sexualencounter with former church secretary Jessica Hahn and paid herhush money. Three months later, amid reports of financialwrongdoing, PTL filed for bankruptcy protection.   On Tuesday, Canadian real estate magnate Stephen Mernick boughtPTL's assets, including its Christian theme park, hotel andbroadcast studios in Fort Mill, S.C., for $65 million in U.S.Bankruptcy Court.   The fate of the PTL's religious operations, which were spun offby the court into the non-profit Heritage Ministries, remainedunclear.
