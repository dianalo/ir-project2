Smith</HL><DD> 08/25/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SUPREME COURT (SUP)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN><TEXT>   Civics classes don't really explain why our fellow citizens who are willing to take on the burdens and responsibilities of public life must be prepared first to go through a process so intense it would bring a smile to the face of that notorious Spanish inquisitor, Tomas de Torquemada. I think we go too far, but I also think that if there is anyone who can stand up to the process, it is Robert Bork.    Several years ago, I met Judge Bork and, while I can't remember whether he had a beard then, I can remember very clearly the brilliance of his mind and the independence of his character. And I can't remember whether I thought he was &quot;probusiness,&quot; but what I do remember is that my business colleagues and I needed, at the time, to understand just exactly what the law was in a specific set of circumstances. There was no better person to ask what the law is than Bob Bork.    That is still true today.    It may be interesting to contemplate what the law should be, but in business it is essential to know with some certainty what the law actually is.    Congress, 50 state legislatures and thousands of cities, counties and other legislative entities are in the process of adding laws to the books virtually every day. There is plenty of uncertainty in that process. Add to that the welter of rules and regulations promulgated by hundreds of government agencies in Washington and across the land, and the uncertainty in which business must operate can be nearly overwhelming. If, in the face of all that, you add legal uncertainty to the business landscape the efficient operation of the American economy is clearly at risk.    So what does this have to do with Judge Bork?    For starters, he is on record as saying that such uncertainty is a boon only to lawyers: &quot;It makes their practices lucrative and their clients' lives wretched.&quot; (Among his many virtues are humor and candor, even about his own profession.)    From what I know about him and from what I have read about his view of judicial life, I believe Judge Bork has an enduring commitment to the rule of law. He is an advocate of judicial restraint. He has said, &quot;I have long been opposed to judges who write their own views into law, rather than what they think, on the basis of principled interpretation, the law is.&quot;    What would that &quot;get&quot; for business? Not what a lot of people -- for and against Judge Bork's nomination -- seem to think it would.    There is nothing in his record that indicates he will do anything but decide a case on the basis of what the legislators have passed and what has been enacted into law, within the constraints of the Constitution. What that would mean is a lot less uncertainty in the courts. It would mean some vital predictability that the laws that are enacted are what we all will be expected to meet and that we would not be trying to meet laws that are created decision-by-decision in the courts. That is all business can ask for.    Judicial restraint is not partisan and it isn't pro -- or anti-business. Forty-two years ago President Harry Truman wrote: &quot;The Courts should be strictly judicial and not dabble in policy -- except in the interpretation of the Constitution. It is not at all proper for courts to try to make laws or to read law school theories into the law and policy laid down by the Congress.&quot;    I think President Truman was right on that one. Judge Bork is not a dabbler. He isn't likely to read law-school or personal theories into the laws. I suspect if someone wants to know where Judge Bork will come out on any of the critical issues, he would have more luck examining existing law for clues than he would have trying to figure out Judge Bork's personal views.    I have no doubt that Judge Bork has strong views on issues and that he will express them. But when decision time comes on the court, I also believe that he will decide on the basis of what the law is and leave to the elected lawmakers the question of what the law should be.    This approach seems to be eminently successful. Judge Bork has written more than 100 majority opinions and joined in an additional 300; none of these have ever been reversed by the Supreme Court. That record says a lot more about the quality of his work than does speculation about the future.    President Truman was right about judicial restraint. So were many prominent legal authorities, including Justice Felix Frankfurter, who called on judges to &quot;subordinate one's personal pulls and private views to the law&quot; and President Carter's White House Counsel, Lloyd Cutler, who observed that &quot;all justices subscribe at least nominally to this philosophy.&quot;    I think Judge Bork should be confirmed as a justice of the Supreme Court and have the opportunity to continue in the tradition of judicial restraint. As a bonus, his vigor, candor and humor will certainly liven up the proceedings.    ---   Mr. Smith is chairman of General Motors Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
