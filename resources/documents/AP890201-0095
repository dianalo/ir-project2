SNIFFEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writers</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chairman of a House subcommittee thatoversees federal courts says he will review proposed big pay raisesfor senior judges who do no legal work.   Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., ``believes he will have to lookfurther into the senior judge question,'' staff member Mary Dixonsaid Tuesday.   Dozens of federal judges who technically are semi-retired but whodo not hear cases stand to gain large pay raises unless Congressrejects a government salary package due to take effect a week fromtoday. The Associated Press reported earlier this week that as manyas a fifth of the federal judiciary's ``senior judges'' no longerhear cases but are in line for the increases anyway.   Ms. Dixon said Kastenmeier plans to review the matter soon withthe subcommittee's lawyer, but ``believes he has at least a month''to study it. Asked if Kastenmeier plans an attempt to block theproposed raises, Ms. Dixon said he has not yet made such a decision.   Kastenmeier heads the House Judiciary subcommittee on courts andthe administration of justice.   The pay package includes raises of about 50 percent for some2,500 top federal officials, including members of Congress and topexecutive branch employees.   The Constitution forbids lowering judicial salaries. Ms. Dixonsaid Kastenmeier is studying whether the pay raises for the seniorjudges can be killed after next Wednesday but before the biggerpaychecks go out.   A Republican member of Kastenmeier's subcommittee, Rep. CarlosMoorhead of California, previously questioned the wisdom of raisingthe salaries of those senior federal judges who no longer handle anycases.   ``It doesn't seem fair,'' Moorhead said, adding that thesubcommittee may want to study ``establishing some minimum work toqualify for the raises.''   Older federal judges who opt for senior status qualify foractive-duty pay raises even after stepping down from full-time duty.If those judges choose the other option provided by Congress _ fullretirement through resignation _ they keep for life the same salarythey received on their last day of work.   Most senior judges, although lightening their workload, help thefederal court system cope with the increasing number of cases. Butrecords indicate that as many as one-fifth of the nation's 306senior judges, including former Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, nolonger do any judicial work.   Burger, who has not wielded a gavel since taking senior status in1986, is in line for a $60,000 pay raise _ to $175,000 a year.Salaries would rise from $89,500 to $135,000 for federal trialjudges; from $95,000 to $145,000 for federal appellate judges; andfrom $110,000 to $165,000 for Supreme Court justices.   Any attempts to limit or block the raises could be covered by a1980 Supreme Court opinion written by Burger. In that case, thecourt held that although Congress may not thwart judicial pay raisesonce they take effect, it may do away with planned increases``before they ... become a part of the compensation due.''</TEXT></DOC>
