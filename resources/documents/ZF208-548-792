 This electronic infrastructure, as it is sometimes called, is themost critical piece of the network.andM;An improperly designed and installed cable plant will greatly increase thenetwork's life cycle cost for a number of reasons.andP;  Primarily, the cost ofadds, moves, and changes are far greater for a haphazardly designed cableplant than for a properly planned and installed system.andP;  This is particularlytrue if you are using many different media  such as twisted pair, opticalfiber, and different coaxial cables to support the connectivity requirementsof the networks.andM;Secondly, a poorly implemented system will make troubleshooting moredifficult.andP;  And trouble is inevitable.andP;  Generally cable plants that haveevolved over a number of years are not documented properly, so just findingthe correct cable to test in those table plants could take hours.andP;  At today'shigh labor rates, it's often cheaper to install a new cable than to trace anold one and determine if it is defective, but it could make matters worse inthe long run.andM;A well-designed and installed structured cabling system can eliminate theproblems with a standard media set uniformly distributed throughout thefacility.andP;  With a standard media set, telecommunication outlets are availableat almost any location requiring connectivity.andP;  This reduces the need torelocate a user's terminal by moving the device to a new outlet and makingthe appropriate patching or cross-connect change in the tele-communicationcloset.andM;A standardized set of one or more transmission media reduces the need forcable additions by allowing the use of devices called baluns.andP;  These devices,which are nothing more than impedance matching transformers, match thetransmission requirements of the equipment to the characteristics of thetransmission media.andP;  When using baluns, one type of media may supportnumerous types of terminal devices.andM;Even though the goal may be to place outlets at all possible futurelocations, the cable might need to be retrofitted later.andP;  This could be inresponse to architectural changes that are unrelated to, but inevitablyaffect, the telecommunications and data communications infrastructure.andM;A retrofit might arise from a need to expand the network's overall extent.andO;For this reason, the most essential part of a well-structured cabling systemare the pathways (such as risers, conduits, cable trays) and containers (suchas telecommunication closets, equipment rooms, and entrance facilities)housing the transmission media.andP;  Properly placed, sized, and equippedpathways and containers will make retrofit and renovation much easier andless costly.andM;Although this approach to cable building can provide tremendous advantagesand lower costs over a system's life, upfront costs can be higher than theinitial cost of the &quot;only what we need, only where we need it&quot; approach.andP;  Thecost difference is further amplified by poor planning, the user's execution,or waiting until the last moment before planning and installing the system.andO;However, with early, complete planning, upfront costs can be brought down toonly slightly more per user outlet than traditional wiring methods.andM;Plan Before You PullandM;In this article, I will discuss some factors that go into the design of astructured cabling system, focusing on general topology, distancelimitations, and media selection.andP;  First, a few general concepts to beapplied to the planning of a structured cabling system, regardless of size,complexity, or cost, should be reviewed.andM;The first thing to  remember is that there is no such thing as a universalcabling system.andP;  This idea, promulgated in the telecommunications industryover the past years, has some of us believing that a magic media will supporttelecommunications needs forever.andP;  At one point the IBM Cabling System wasthat medium, now it's multimode optical fiber.andM;Indeed, recent studies by major systems vendors have indicated that evenstate-of-the-art cabling systems need to be augmented or replaced every sixto eight years to keep pace with increasing speed and bandwidth requirements.andO;You could conceivably need to retrofit your facility's entire cablinginfrastructure eight to 10 times over the life of the building.andP;  Althoughmost network planners don't like to hear this, preferring instead to cling toa magic media, experience has shown that frequent tinkering with a cableplant is more the rule than the exception, even in well-designed and executedsystems.andM;Because the cabling infrastructure is such a dynamic system, properly plannedand executed building architectures (pathways and containers) are critical tothe installation's success.andP;  After all, if you intend to install or changecable fairly regularly (and who doesn't), you'll find it much easier and lesscostly if properly designed pathways are available to your cabling crews.andO;The importance of this cannot be overemphasized.andP;  If you are one of the luckyfew designers to have an unlimited space in which to work and an unlimitedbudget, it will be easy to plan proper pathways and containers.andP;  however, formost of us, space and budget constraints necessitate difficult choices andtradeoffs.andM;Building architectural factors, such as entrance facility location, number ofrisers and telecommunication closet size and location, are cast in concretewhen a building is constructed or renovated.andP;  Any change after constructionis costly.andP;  Likewise, planning a telecommunications infrastructure shouldbegin as early as possible, hopefully while it is still on paper to avoidlater costs.andM;Vendor independence is another important concept in building a structuredcabling system.andP;  A properly designed cabling system should be independent ofthe systems connected to it, in much the same way that the electricaldistribution system is independent of the equipment it supports.andM;Structuring the PlantandM;The best way to begin planning a large-scale cable plant (especially onecovering multiple buildings) is to imagine that the overall system iscomposed of several smaller subsystems.andP;  Each subsystem can be designedindependently and optimized to provide the appropriate levels of service.andO;Figure 1 (p.andP;  90) illustrates the subsystems encompassing a campus-widenetwork.andP;  A horizontal subsystem covers the portion of the system between thetelecommunication closets and user outlets.andP;  The vertical subsystem orbackbone includes the media connecting the telecommunication closets to anequipment room or entrance facility.andP;  Finally, the campus subsystem (which isan extension of each building's backbone) interconnects the buildings toperhaps a central main distribution facility, local exchange carrier, orother common carrier points of demarcation.andM;Figure 2 shows the physical relationship between the subsystems.andP;  Thishierarchical star configuration is the standard in the telecommunicationsindustry and should be used regardless of your network's logicalconfiguration.andP;  The greatest advantage of the physical star is its ability tobe configured into almost any logical topology.andP;  Through active and passivenetwork components in the telecommunication closet, the physical star can bemade to function as a logical bus, ring, or star.andM;Interfacing between the subsystems can be as simple as cross-connecting acable in the horizontal subsystem to a cable in the vertical subsystem, suchas what might be done in a telephone network.andP;  Conversely, it can be ascomplicated as where bridges, routers, or gateways in a LAN might connectnetworks to a shared, high-speed backbone.andP;  The key is that these points ofinterface are standardized and located only in the telecommunication closetsand equipment rooms.andM;An important feature to this approach is the maximum permissible cablingdistances applied to each subsystem.andP;  Listing 1 shows the recommendeddistance limitations for the subsystems.andP;  In the horizontal subsystem, forexample, the maximum distance between a user's terminal device and thetelecommunication closet is 90 meters.andP;  This includes the length of themounting cord connecting the device to the telecommunications outlet.andP;  Datacommunications have limited distances over twisted pair cables, making thelimitations for the subsystems necessary.andP;  By complying with the limitations,any device you attach to the cable can interface with other equipment locatedwithin the telecommunication closet.andM;During the initial building design, the architectural aspects of the facilityshould allow implementation of a cable plant conforming to the distancelimitations.andP;  The architect and designers must be aware early on of thecabling system requirements.andP;  Since building designers usually are notattuned to telecommunications issues, you must provide them with explicitrequirements for equipment room, telecommunication closet, and cable trayplacement.andM;The Horizontal SubsystemandM;Design of the horizontal subsystem is perhaps the most critical, difficultpart of the entire system.andP;  The biggest problem the designer is faced with isdeciding on one or more media to be installed between the telecommunicationclosets and each telecommunications outlet.andM;Following today's trends, this article will focus on twisted pair cables inthis subsystem.andP;  However, any number of other media such as coaxial cable oroptical fiber can be used.andP;  The chief advantages of twisted pair are its lowcost and ability to support a variety of analog and digital signals,including voice.andP;  Regardless of the media utilized, the general distributionconcepts are the same.andM;A heated debate has arisen about the merits and drawbacks of unshieldedtwisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted pair (STP) cables in the horizontalsubsystem.andP;  For the purposes of this article, the UTP cable is the DIW cableby ATandamp;T.andP;  This cable has a greater data-carrying capacity than plaintelephone wire, and UTP cables with these characteristics should always bespecified for both voice and data services.andP;  Similarly, the STP cable I referto is the IBM Type 1 cable.andP;  Listing 2 shows the cables' physical andelectrical characteristics.andM;The debate over the two media has focused on the data-carrying capacity andcosts.andP;  Only data communication systems are of concern here, because the STPcable is unsuitable for supporting either analog or digital voice services.andO;In voices services, UTP has been the de facto industry standard for severaldecades and is likely to remain so for many years.andP;  Because of this, youshould plan to run at least one UTP cable to every outlet to support voiceservices.andM;Until a few years ago, UTP was only suitable for supporting voice andlow-speed (EIA-232 type) signals.andP;  If users wished to support digital signalsin the megabit range (which are typical of most modern LANs), they had toinstall the more expensive STP cable, or perhaps coax.andP;  This changedrecently.andP;  In response to users' demands for a less expensive networkingmedium, many vendors notably SynOptics (Mountain View, CA) have introducedproducts allowing Token Ring and Ethernet to function on UTP.andP;  Thus, userscan install the less expensive media or take advantage of existing cabling tosupport their networks.andM;IBM, the originators of the STP cable, now supports UTP for the4M-bits-per-second Token Ring, albeit only in cases of small ring size (72users per ring for UTP vs.andP;  260 users per ring for STP).andP;  Although IBM'srecent introduction of the long-awaited 16M-bits-per-second Token Ringrefueled the debate of media choice (since IBM will only support it on theSTP cable), network vendors such as Proteon (Westboro, MA) and Ungermann-Bass(Santa Clara, CA) have announced or introduced products supporting16M-bits-per-second on UTP.andP;  Since this is the same sequence of events aswhen the 4M-bits-per-second Token Ring was announced, one wonders how long itwill be before IBM gives in and supports the faster Token Ring on UTP.andM;If UTP supports all the services that are supported on the more expensive STPcable and the voice and async data (which are not supported on STP), youmight wonder why anyone would consider installing STP.andP;  Several reasonssupport the use of STP cable.andM;First, consider vendor support.andP;  For some large users, such as financialinstitutions, complete systems support from hardware vendors is critical.andP;  Ifcomplete support will only come through the use of STP cable (as is the casewith IBM and the 16M-bits-per-second Token Ring), the additional costs are asmall price to pay.andP;  Secondly, the STP cable can help prevent electromagneticand radio frequency interference.andP;  A less important reason for using STPcable is that most LANs function at greater distances from thetelecommunication closets on STP than on UTP.andP;  However, in a properlydesigned facility, a user's outlet should not be more than 90 cable meters(300 feet) from the telecommunication closet.andP;  Almost all networks functionon the UTP cable if it is within this distance of the closet.andM;If, however, you select the STP cable as your medium for networking in thehorizontal subsystem, you can purchase a composite version containing theshielded and four unshielded pairs (for voice and low speed data) eitherunder a common outer sheath or as individual sheathed siamese cable.andP;  Thecables are pulled as one and then the two types are separated in thetelecommunication closet for termination on their hardware.andP;  This allowscabling crews to install data and voice cables simultaneously, which greatlyreduces labor costs during installation.andP;  If you choose to install this typeof cable because you need or would like to install UTP along with the STPcable, select a siamese version such as AMP's (Berwyn, PA), because it allowsyou to maintain the sheath integrity of the individual STP and UTP cableswithin the closet.andP;  This can simplify installation and termination of thecables, particularly if many cables are terminated in one closet.andM;If you choose to use only UTP cables in your horizontal subsystem, you mustdecide how many pairs to install and under how many sheaths.andP;  A good rule ofthumb for initial installation is one sheath, one application; that is, youshould install one cable for each device supported at the workstation.andO;Typically, you would have a cable for voice applications and another for aterminal or networked PC.andM;Although this approach may seem costly, it helps eliminate the shared-sheathproblem of crosstalk between different cable pairs carrying differentsignals.andP;  Because it is difficult to predict exactly which signals arecompatible and which will interfere with each other, interference should bekept to a minimum.andP;  This is particularly important for digital signals underthe same sheath as analog voice and data signals, where ring voltages andoff-hook conditions can create large transients that could interfere withdigital signals.andP;  The best choice in this case is to provide one or more UTPcables, each containing four pairs.andP;  The four-pair cable is the industrystandard for UTP in the horizontal subsystem, chiefly because of itscompatibility with most Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) Basic RateInterface (BRI) offerings.andM;Because of the shared-sheath problem previously discussed, you should avoidinstalling 25-pair cables.andP;  Although some service (such as 10Base-T Ethernet)are compatible with this cable, many others (such as Token Ring) are not.andO;Use of this cable may be cost-effective initially and it can severely limityour system's long-term support of a variety of services.andM;If the cables in the horizontal subsystem are to be run in a return airplenum-type ceiling, they must be plenum-rated or contained in conduit forthe entire run.andP;  The National Electric Code does not permit the installationof PVC-jacketed cables exposed in such an environment because of PVC's highsmoke output when burned.andP;  While plenum cables are quite expensive comparedto standard, PVC-jacketed types, their use is highly recommended, even whennot required by code.andP;  Not only will the elimination of conduit lowerinstallation costs and provide greater system flexibility, but plenum-ratedcables have better performance characteristics than PVC-jacketed types.andM;Regardless of your choice of media, they must be installed properly andaccording to the manufacturer's requirements.andP;  STP cables must be groundedcorrectly and only terminated using the so-called 802.5 genderless connector.andO;This is the only way to insure the proper grounding of the system, makingfuture operations and troubleshooting easy.andP;  Also, the equipment racks inwhich these cables terminate must be grounded adequately for performance andsafety reasons.andP;  Similarly, UTP cables should be terminated on theappropriate style punch down blocks.andM;Just as with the controversy surrounding media selection, much has beenwritten about the proper termination hardware for UTP cables.andP;  Until a fewyears ago, the only hardware was the telco-standard 66-style terminatingblock.andP;  However, in the past few years, several manufacturers have introducedterminal blocks utilizing a number of technologies.andP;  Each, of course, claimsto provide superior performance as compared to 66-type blocks as well as toall other types.andP;  All that is certain, however, is that the newer blocks costmore than 66 blocks.andM;Most of the new products, such as ATandamp;T's 110 system, Northern Telecom's BIX,and ADC Communication's QX, do not have transmission, characteristicssuperior to 66 blocks' in terms of analog voice.andP;  However, their superiorperformance with high-speed digital signals makes the extra cost justifiable.andM;The new technologies are compact.andP;  which is a great benefit in smalltelecommunication closets or in large installations where many cables must beterminated.andP;  Also, most of the new products allow for the use of patch cordsin lieu of cross-connect wire for connecting horizontal cable pairs to therisers.andP;  This is a great advantage to users who wish to do their own systemadministration, but are uncomfortable using a punch-down tool.andM;The BackboneandM;The vertical subsystem, or backbone, provides connectivity between individualtelecommunication closets and a centralized equipment room or buildingentrance facility.andP;  The media utilized in this subsystem is characterized bythe support of a highly concentrated volume of traffic over relatively longdistances (up to 500 meters) and by generally higher overall bandwidthrequirements than the media used in the horizontal subsystem.andP;  Again, thereare many choices of media, with some more common than others.andM;For analog and digital voice services and certain data communicationssystems, UTP should be the medium of choice because of its low cost and highreliability.andP;  For voice services, distance limitations are generally not afactor on the single building or small campus level.andP;  However, most dataterminals (such as Wang and IBM systems) are limited to the distance they runover UTP or even STP.andP;  Moreover, the maximum transmission distance hasaffected such factors as balun type, cable quality, number and quality ofcross-connects or splices, EMI/RFI environment, and the presence of othersignals under the same sheath.andP;  Listing 3 shows reasonable distancelimitations over twisted pair cables.andP;  As long as you are in theselimitations and using high-quality passive components (baluns, connectors,and terminal blocks), you should have no problems.andM;You can minimize potential problems by adhering to a variation on theone-sheath, one-application rule.andP;  First, segregate voice (especially analogvoice) signals from data signals and utilize separate cables for each.andO;Further, for the data backbone, individual 25-pair cables each dedicated to aspecific system such as IBM 3270 and Wang should be used.andP;  Thus, you cancontrol which signals are mixed in the same sheath and prevent potentialinterference.andP;  If individual 25-pair cables cannot be used because of cost orspace, multiple 100-pair cables are suitable, but you should still practicesignal segregation in the individual 25-pair binder groups.andP;  Listing 4 showsthe recommended characteristics of UTP riser cable.andM;Although the UTP takes care of all voice and most low-speed terminal-to-hostrequirements, in some instances such as high-speed data or long distances,UTP is unsuitable.andP;  In these cases, media such as optical fiber or coaxialcable can help overcome the UTP limitations.andM;Optical fiber in the system backbone is desirable for many reasons.andP;  Its highbandwidth makes it ideal for use with multiplexers, in which signals frommany terminals are combined onto a single high-speed channel and transcases,media such as optical fiber or coaxial cable can help overcome the UTPlimitations.andM;Optical fiber in the system backbone is desirable for many reasons.andP;  Its highbandwidth makes it ideal for use with multiplexers, in which signals frommany terminals are combined onto a single high-speed channel and transmittedalong a single pair of optical fibers.andP;  In facilities with high terminalpopulations, this can greatly reduce the cable that must be installed in thevertical subsystem.andM;Optical fiber quickly is becoming the medium of choice as a high-speed LANbackbone.andP;  The emerging 100M-bits-per-second Fiber Distributed Data Interfacestandard is a good example of this.andP;  Indeed, today's speed and bandwidthceilings are more a factor of transmitter limitations than an inherentlimitations in the medium itself.andP;  The superior transmission characteristics,the material's comparatively low cost, and EMI/RFI immunity make opticalfiber a necessity in a modern cable plant.andM;Now that you're convinced that you can't live without a little fiber in yoursystem, which fiber should you choose?andP;  Two broad classifications of fiberare available in premises telecommunications systems, single mode andmultimode.andP;  Without going into great detail, single-mode fiber has a higherbandwidth capability than multimode fiber but at the expense of highermaterial and installation costs.andP;  additionally, single-mode fiber requirestransmission equipment that uses expensive laser diodes as a light source.andO;Multimode fiber, on the other hand, can operate with equipment that utilizeslow-cost, highly reliable LEDs as transmitters.andP;  It is also much easier andtherefore less costly to reminate, connectorize, and splice multimode opticalfibers primarily due to their larger core diameter.andP;  While multimode fiberhas a smaller overall bandwidth than a single-made fiber, its capacity ismore than enough to service most premise applications.andP;  For these reasons,multimode fiber is used more often in this environment.andM;Multimode fiber comes in several varieties and is characterized by core andcladding diameters.andP;  Of the available fibers with 100/140, 100/125, 85/125and 62.5/125 core and cladding diameters (expressed in micrometers), the62.5/125 micrometer cable is the most suitable in premises systems.andP;  ITsrelatively small core diameter (62.5 microns) provides high bandwidthcapabilities over premises distances, but is large enough to makeconnectorization and splicing fast and easy.andP;  This fiber is being adopted byequipment manufacturers as their standard fiber with most manufacturersoffering multiplexers and other transmission equipment optimized for use withthis fiber.andP;  The 62.5/125 micron fiber is the media of choice for FDDI, soits installation provides a good migration path to future high bandwidthservices.andP;  Listing 4 provides the appropriate performance characteristics ofthis optical fiber.andM;Certain coaxial cables are suitable in the backbone.andP;  While its use in thehorizontal subsystem generally it discouraged because each type of coax issuited to only one application such as Ethernet or 3270 systems, coax issuitable in the vertical subsystem as, for example, an Ethernet backbone,connecting individual floor LANs together or to centralized resources.andP;  Inthis case, although you would be installing approprietary cable, thecost-performance ratio is high enough to justify it, particularly if youalready have a lot of Ethernet equipment that is incompatible with opticalfiber.andM;Another use for coaxial cable in the backbone is video.andP;  Currently, abroadband coaxial cable distribution system is the only cost-effective meansof providing multichannel, full bandwidth video signals in the premisesenvironment.andP;  If you need such cabling in your system, you will have torequire the services of a company specializing the design of these systems.andM;IF properly designed, a portion of the bandwidth available on the broadbanddistribution system can be used for data communications services, such asEthernet.andP;  Utilizing the system for both video and data communicationservices helps to offset the high cost of the system.andM;The Campus SystemandM;Media choices in the interbuilding, or campus, subsystem are essentially thesame as those in the backbone subsystem.andP;  The chief problem at this level isthe physical and electrical protection that must be provided for all cablesrunning between buildings.andM;Electrical protection is important for life safety and equipment protection.andO;Should an unprotected outside plant cable sustain a lightning strike or comeinto contact with high-voltage electrical service, the cable and theequipment connected to it could be severely damageD.andP;  Because proper boundingand grouping procedures can best be described as a black art, it is wise toseek an expert's assistance in the this field before designing a building orcampus grounding system.andM;IF you are using optical fiber cable at this level, you can eliminategrounding by specifying a nonmetallic optical fiber cable.andP;  Even though glassfibers do not conduct electricity, some cables contain metallic materials asstrength members or for mechanical protection.andM;Other than electrical protection, a potential problem designing a campussubsystem is the physical protection of the cables installed betweenbuildings.andP;  These cables are exposed to physical abuses, ranging from weatherdamage to animal attacks (rodents just love high density polyethelene cablejackets) to vandalism.andP;  You should first make a realistic assessment of theproblems the outside plant cable may face.andP;  If you're specifying aerialcable, you probably won't need a waterproof cable or a steel sheath forrodent protection.andP;  However, if a cable will be underground in a duct bank orburied directly, waterproofing and a steel shealth may be necessary.andM;Finally, outside plant cable is usually not suited for use exposed inbuildings.andP;  The jacketing material and flooding (waterproofing) compounds forthese cables generate large volumes of smoke and gases if burned.andP;  Whenoutside plant cable enters a building, it must be run in conduit or expose acable tray to its termination point, or it must be transitioned (via a spliceor cross connect) to an NEC approved building cable within 50 feet ofentering the building.andM;DocumentationandM;Proper documentation and management of a newly installed cable plant cannotbe overemphasized.andP;  Without up-to-date records of cable types, uses and pairavailability, the execution of adds, moves and changes is a nightmare andtroubleshooting network problems is nearly as bad.andP;  In short, you'll be backto where you were in the old days, before you spent this year's (and probablynext year's) profits on a new cabling system.andP;  Many good PC-based systems areavailable that use database management systems (DBMSs) to track cable andequipment records.andP;  With a little research and some comparison shopping, youshould find one that meets your needs.andP;  Make sure that the system you choosecan track your network hardware, and the the cables.andP;  Also, know that it willhandle not only the media you currently have but also any that you mayinstall later.andP;  The last thing you need is to spend hours creating a databasethat reflects your installed system only to find that you have to start overagain with a new system.andM;CAD-based cable and facilities management systems are quite popular and maybe a good choice for your installation.andP;  An excellent example of one suchsystem is Command by Isicad (Anaheim, CA).andP;  Not only is Command a goodmanagement tool, but its integration of the DBMS features with a powerful CADsystem makes it extremely useful as a design aid.andP;  With this type of system,you can create a cable and equipment database as you place equipment andoutlets on a CAD-generated architectural background.andP;  For a large project,the time and manpower saved by such a system can more than offset its initialcost.andM;Anthony Nuciforo, an international telecommunications consultant in New York,N.Y., specializes in premises cabling, LAN, and telecommunications facilitiesdesign.andP;  He also is a member of several Electronic Industries Associationworking groups that are developing standards.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
