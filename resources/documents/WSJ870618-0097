KarrStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LABORECONOMIC NEWS (ECO) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rapid adoption of new industrial technology in the U.S. will minimize unemployment rather than expand the jobless rolls, a National Academy of Sciences study concluded.    In today's climate of rising trade competition, improved technology is increasingly important for the U.S. to compete with foreign countries, the report said. By adding new technological methods slowly, the nation's manufacturers will lose ground to foreign concerns and contribute to unemployment, the academy said.    &quot;The alternative to rapid rates of technological change is stagnation in U.S. wages and employment,&quot; the report said. It added:&quot;Higher productivity growth, which is supported by technological change, is essential to the maintenance of higher real earnings and the preservation of U.S. jobs.&quot;    The conclusion challenged widespread concerns that new technology will spur unemployment by replacing workers with automated manufacturing techniques. But the study acknowledged that technological changes can cause &quot;painful and costly adjustments,&quot; involving temporary job reductions; it recommended stepped up federal actions to soften the impact of such changes.    The recommendations gave some support to legislation pending in Congress that would require employers to notify workers as long as six months in advance of any plant closing, major layoffs or sharp reductions in work hours.    The academy's report said that worker retraining and other adjustment-assistance programs are more effective, and that layoffs are shorter, when employees are given adequate advance notice of closings. The report urged that workers receive at least two to three months' notice.    The report recommended that the government either require advance notice of closings or offer tax incentives to encourage it. The academy said a recent General Accounting Office study showed that workers receive an average of only two to 14 days' advance notice of plant closings, with about 30% not getting any notice at all. Adjustment programs are more effective when workers know well in advance that they must find new employment, the GAO study added.    A more recent survey, conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and covering layoffs in seven states, showed that two-thirds of the workers who lost jobs in the last half of 1985 didn't get any general advance notice.    The proposed notice requirement is opposed by employer groups, which contend it would be an unwarranted government intervention that would hamper management flexibility. One sponsor of the academy's report, the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, took exception to the recommendation, saying that advance-notice requirements would worsen problems for companies &quot;already in an economic straitjacket.&quot;    The academy's report also recommended that job counseling and other employment services be expanded for workers displaced by technological advances, that more federal money be allocated for training and retraining, and that government support be increased for research and other ways to encourage faster adoption of new technology.    Even while urging fast U.S. adoption of new technology, the report conceded that employment is affected more gradually by the adoption of new technologies than by other factors, thus allowing more time for developing adjustment policies for affected workers. And the report said much of the job displacement in recent years was caused by such factors as higher U.S. imports, sluggish exports, slow adoption of some manufacturing advances, rather than any sudden rise in adoption of labor-saving innovations.    The report also insisted that technological change won't limit employment prospects for entrants into the labor force, as long as they have &quot;strong basic skills.&quot; Major categories of occupations will provide expanding numbers of jobs, while the growth of job-seeking new entrants will ease, the study said.    But the academy noted that 20% to 30% of displaced workers lack basic skills and that changes in the economy &quot;will place increasing demands&quot; on workers' ability to adjust. </TEXT></DOC>
