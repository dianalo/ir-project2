The mainresource development problem is efficiently extracting the gas from thereservoir. Future production depends on a combination of gas price andtechnological advances. Gas production can be enhanced by fracturing.Studies have shown that many aspects of fracture design and gas productionare influenced by properties of the rock matrix. Computer models forstimulation procedures require accurate knowledge of flow propertiesof both the rock matrix and the fractured regions. In the proposed work,these properties will be measured along with advanced core analysis procedureaimed at understanding the relationship between pore structure and properties.The objective of this project is to develop reliable core analysis techniquesfor measuring the petrophysical properties of tight gas sands. Recentresearch has indicated that the flow conditions in the reservoir canbe greatly enhanced by the presence of natural fractures, which serveas a transport path for gas from the less permeable matrix. The studyis mainly concerned with the dependence of flow in tight gas matrix andhealed tectonic fractures on water saturation and confining pressure.This dependency is to be related to the detailed pore structure of tightsands as typified by cores recovered in the Multi-Well experiment. 22refs., 34 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
