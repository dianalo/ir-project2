An ad headline asked, &quot;Have You Lost Patience With Your Nursing Career?&quot; followed by a pitch for New Hampshire as a swell place for nurses to live and work, and a coupon to clip and mail.    Similar ads, stressing New Hampshire's low-tax climate and the availability of jobs for nurses' spouses, ran in March in newspapers in Illinois, Michigan, North Dakota and West Virginia. About 80 coupons have arrived so far at the Concord, N.H., office of the New Hampshire Hospital Association, manager of the ad campaign. The response &quot;is more than we expected,&quot; says Gary Carter, the association's president.    In deciding where to place the ads, Mr. Carter says the hospital group looked at states with high unemployment and with an oversupply of nurses. Also states where winters are cold. &quot;It's difficult for some in the South to make the transition to New England winters,&quot; he says.    The hospital association's recruiting effort in the Middle West and in Appalachia reflects a certain desperation. New England has the nation's hottest regional economy and the lowest unemployment rates. New Hampshire's jobless rate in February was 2.7%, the nation's lowest. The six-state region had a combined unemployment rate in March of 4.3%, against a U.S. average of 6.6%.    LOGIC SAYS that workers down on their luck in other parts of the country should be swarming to the Northeast, looking for jobs. But the numbers so far haven't been overwhelming. Indeed, in Massachusetts and Connecticut, the worker influx hasn't come close to offsetting the number of residents leaving the state, most of them retirees headed to the Sun Belt.    One reason has to do with traditional migration routes. &quot;The flows are fairly well defined,&quot; says Lynn Browne, a vice president and economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Unemployed Rust Belt workers who migrated to Houston to build skyscrapers in the early 1980s were travelling a well-beaten labor path stretching between the Great Lakes and the Southwest.    Texas, however, is outside New England's traditional migratory stream. &quot;It's hard for people to make that move,&quot; says George Masnick, a research associate at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &quot;It's partly culture, climate, distance, lack of historical family ties. And certainly the cost of living is prohibitive. It's hard for people to imagine moving from a single-family home in Texas to a studio apartment in Massachusetts for twice the price.&quot;    New England traditionally draws most of its outside workers from the Middle Atlantic states, New York and New Jersey, a region now enjoying its own economic boom. With plenty of work at home, there's little incentive for mid-Atlantic residents to move north.    Still, New England's prosperity is beginning to make a dent in the population picture. The region's chronic population drain has gradually slowed, and in the 12 months ending in April 1985, the region &quot;just barely turned the corner&quot; to net in-migration, according to Mr. Masnick, who uses migration data from federal tax returns.    The turnaround is nearly all the work of New Hampshire. Nearly 14,000 more people moved into that state than left it in the year ended April 1985. For all its publicized prosperity, Massachusetts lost some 7,000 persons in this period, and Connecticut lost about 5,000. Maine and Vermont gained about 2,000 residents through migration, while Rhode Island's net migration was about zero.    ---   FLORIDA BOUND: Six of the 10 fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the U.S. since the 1980 census are in Florida, says Donnelley Marketing, the demographic arm of Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp.    Naples, Fla., scarcely large enough to meet the government's definition of &quot;metropolitan area,&quot; leads the high-growth list. In the past six years, the population of this Gulf Coast community has exploded by 45%, to 125,000 from 86,000. The Naples newcomers fall into two groups, says City Manager Franklin Jones: &quot;fairly affluent people, and then a whole group of working-class people providing the services that the affluent people are demanding.&quot;    Five other Florida metro areas have had population growth over 30% since 1980: Ocala, Fort Pierce, Fort Myers-Cape Coral, Melbourne-Titusville, and West Palm Beach-Boca Raton.    ---   ATLANTA MAGAZINE has a new owner. Philadelphia-based Metrocorp Inc., whose stable of city magazines includes Philadelphia, Boston, and Manhattan inc. bought Atlanta in March in a private sale for an undisclosed price, understood to be around $4 million. The seller was Communication Channels Inc. of Atlanta, a subsidiary of Argus Press Holdings of Great Britain and publisher of some 50 business and industry magazines. With a monthly circulation of about 59,000, Atlanta is similar in size to city magazines in Baltimore, Houston, Pittsburgh and San Diego.    ---   ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT QUARTERLY intends to publish both scholarly and practical articles dealing with economic revitalization. The inaugural issue includes a critique of those controversial systems that rank states on the basis of business climate. The publisher is Sage Publications Inc., Newbury Park, Calif. </TEXT></DOC>
