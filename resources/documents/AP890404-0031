No group immediately claimed responsibility, but suspicion fellon Protestant guerrillas.   Belfast police headquarters said in a statement that the attackoccurred shortly after midnight in the town about 40 milesnorthwest of Belfast. Police said the unidentified 29-year-oldvictim was the father of four.   They said his 3-month-old daughter was asleep in a crib besidehis bed when he was shot. The child was unhurt, they said.   A stolen car believed to have been used by the gunmen for theirgetaway was later found burned out in another part of Ballymoney.   The killing appeared to be the latest in a series of what arethought to be retaliatory murders by Protestant and Roman Catholicextremists that began Feb. 12 with the slaying of a prominentCatholic attorney.   Meanwhile, a news report on Monday said the British BroadcastingCorp. transferred two of its Belfast-based journalists out ofNorthern Ireland after the Irish Republican Army threatened to killthem.   The BBC refused to discuss the report by Press Association, thedomestic British news agency, other than to confirm ``two BBCpersonnel have received death threats from the IRA.''   Press Association did not name the journalists, but said one wasthe editor of news and current affairs for Northern Ireland and theother was a female reporter.   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland andunite the predominantly Protestant province with the mainly RomanCatholic Republic of Ireland. Protestant guerrillas are fightingthe effort.</TEXT></DOC>
