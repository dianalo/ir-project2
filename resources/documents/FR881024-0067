The Commissionhas promulgated sentencing guidelines and policy statements applicableto most Federal offenses committed by individuals.The preliminary draft guidelines previously published by the Commissionin the October 1, 1986, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 35079) also included discussions of generalapproaches to organizational sentencing. However, the Commission's initialset of sentencing guidelines and policy statements, published in the May13, 1987, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 18046), deferred promulgation of guidelinesfor organizational defendants except with respect to fines for antitrustoffenses.After further review and research, the Commission now is considering thedevelopment of more comprehensive guidelines and policy statements forsentencing organizations. The Commission invites public comment on allaspects of organization sanctions and public participation in the hearing.As a vehicle for stimulating the broadest possible range of public input,the Commission is distributing a volume entitled ``Discussion Materialson Organizational Sanctions'' that contains (i) A discussion draft of sentencingguidelines and policy statements covering all types of organizational sentences(restitution, forfeitures, fines, notice to victims, and probation), (ii)a partial alternative to the discussion draft, consisting of a draft proposalon standards for organizational probation, (iii) an empirical report onsentencing of organizations in the Federal courts during the period of1984 through 1987, and (iv) a staff working paper on criminal sentencingpolicy for organizations. In addition, the Discussion Materials includea general statement of the subjects and issues regarding organizationalsanctions on which the Commission particularly invites public analysisand comment and a reprint of Standard 18-2.8 (Organizational Sanctions)of the American Bar Association's Standards for Criminal Justice (1980and Supp. 1986).Copies of the Discussion Materials may be obtained from the Commissionupon request. The Commission encourages interested persons to obtain andcomment upon the Discussion Materials; however, the Commission emphasizesthat it has not adopted any of the approaches suggested in the DiscussionMaterials and welcomes comments suggesting alternative approaches.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Section 217(a) of the Comprehensive Crime Control Actof 1984 (28 U.S.C. 994, 995).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William W.
