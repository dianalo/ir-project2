(``Act'') authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to designatediscrete areas of the marine environment as National Marine Sanctuariesif, as required by section 303 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1433), the Secretaryfinds, in consultation with the Congress, a variety of specified officials,and other interested persons, that the designation will fulfill the purposeand policies of the Act (set forth in section 301(b) (16 U.S.C. 1431(b)))and: (1) The area proposed for designation is of special national significancedue to its resource or human-use values; (2) existing State and Federalauthorities are inadequate to ensure coordinated and comprehensive conservationand management of the area, including resource protection, scientific research,and public education; (3) designation of the area as a National MarineSanctuary will facilitate the coordinated and comprehensive conservationand management of the area; and (4) the area is of a size and nature thatwill permit comprehensive and coordinated conservation and management.Section 303 of the Act requires the Secretary to make a number of findingsbefore he or she can designate an area as a National Marine Sanctuary.Section 304 of the Act requires the Secretary to give notice of the designationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, to take a variety of other actions includingpreparation of a MP for the Sanctuary and a FEIS for the designation, andto issue necessary and reasonable regulations implementing the designation.The authority of the Secretary to designate National Marine Sanctuarieshas been delegated to the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere byDOC Organization Order 10-15, andSection;3.01(z) (Jan. 11, 1988). The authorityto administer the other provisions of the Act has been delegated to theAssistant Administrator for Ocean Services and Coastal Zone Managementof NOAA by NOAA Circular 83-38, Directive 05-50 (Sept. 21, 1983, as amended).The waters surrounding Cordell Bank were nominated for designation as aNational Marine Sanctuary in July 1981. On June 30, 1983, NOAA declaredthe area an active candidate for designation. A public scoping meetingto gather information to determine the range and significance of issuesrelated to designation and management was held on April 25, 1984.Cordell Bank and its surrounding waters, because of a rare combinationof oceanic conditions and undersea topography, provide a highly productivemarine environment in a discrete, well defined area. The prevailing CaliforniaCurrent flows southward along the coast, while the upwelling of nutrient-richbottom waters brings nutrients and stimulates the growth of planktonicorganisms. These nutrients support the entire food chain from small crustaceansto fish, marine mammals and seabirds that form the exceptionally vigorous,ecological community flourishing at Cordell Bank. The area is being designatedas a National Marine Sanctuary for the purpose of protecting and conservingthe area and ensuring the continued availability of the ecological, research,educational, aesthetic, and recreational resources therein. In addition,historical or cultural resources may be present within the Cordell Bankarea and its designation as a Sanctuary will protect these resources aswell.On August 28, 1987, NOAA published proposed regulations to implement theproposed designation for the Sanctuary in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 32563) and invited public comment. Onthe same date, NOAA issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS)and MP which described in detail the proposed regulatory regime and alternativesto it and, in accordance with section 304(a)(1)(C) of the Act, sent a DesignationProspectus to the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the UnitedStates House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Scienceand Transportation of the United States Senate for review and approval.Public hearings to receive comments on the proposed designation and DEIS/MPwere held in Bodega, California, on September 29, 1987, and in San Francisco,California, on September 30, 1987. Comments received by NOAA in responseto the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice and at the public hearings on the DEIS/MPwere reviewed and, where appropriate, the recommendations contained thereinwere incorporated in the FEIS/MP. The significant comments on the proposedregulations and the regulatory elements of the DEIS/MP and FEIS/MP andNOAA's responses to them follow:(1) <T3>Comment: </T3>The majority of commentators recommended selection ofthe boundary option encompassing the largest area (397.05 square nauticalmiles) (boundary alternative number 1). These commentators felt that thearea encompassed was of ecological significance and in need of protectionand that the larger area would make management and protection of the Sanctuaryeasier.<T3>Response: </T3>NOAA has adopted this recommendation. The larger boundaryencompasses additional habitat used by marine mammals and seabirds forresting, feeding and migration. In addition, it provides a larger ecologicalbuffer area for the unique concentration of resources found on and aroundCordell Bank. The larger boundary also provides for a more easily managedarea as it is contiguous to the Point Reyes-Farallon Islands National MarineSanctuary (PRNMS).The benthic resources, marine mammals and seabirds that are observed onand around Cordell Bank and on the adjacent continental shelf break weredescribed in the DEIS/MP. The distribution of these organisms on, and inthe area surrounding, the Bank supported designation of a smaller area(101.10 square nautical miles) (boundary alternative number 2). However,information provided to NOAA during the DEIS/MP comment period and theresults of recent research demonstrates substantial use by seabirds andmarine mammals of the area encompassed by boundary alternative number 1.(2) <T3>Comment: </T3>A great majority of commentators recommended adoptionof a regulation prohibiting all hydrocarbon exploration and developmentactivities within the Sanctuary.<T3>Response: </T3>This alternative was not examined in the DEIS/MP. Whenit was raised in comments on the DEIS/MP, the FEIS/MP did not rate it asthe preferred option. While hydrocarbon exploration, development, and productionactivities could threaten Sanctuary resources (impacts from seismic exploration,oil discharges from accidental spills including well blow-outs, and on-sitedischarges of drill cuttings and drilling muds) (see FEIS/MP, Vol. I, pp.82-91), the FEIS/MP opined that it was not necessary to prohibit all hydrocarbonexploration and development activities within the Sanctuary at this time.The United States Department of the Interior's Outer Continental Shelf(OCS) Oil and Gas 5-Year Leasing Plan, in recognition of the unlikelihoodof finding viable oil and gas reserves under Cordell Bank and the areawithin the 50 fathom isobath surrounding the Bank (together, the core areaof the Sanctuary, consisting of approximately 18.14 square nautical miles)and the special environmental sensitivity of Cordell Bank, has deferred,until its expiration in February 1992, leasing the core area. The 5-yearplan, the Sanctuary regulations, the management framework, and other Federalregulations and statutes were believed adequate to protect Sanctuary resourcesfrom being damaged from hydrocarbon exploration and development activities.Upon publication of the FEIS/MP, NOAA received additional public commentsurging that oil and gas activities be banned throughout the Sanctuary.NOAA also received a letter from EPA stating that, based on informationin the FEIS, a Sanctuary-wide ban on hydrocarbon development appeared tobe the environmentally preferable alternative.Based on all the above, NOAA is: (1) By this notice of final rule banningall oil and gas activities on Cordell Bank and within the 50 fathom isobathsurrounding the Bank; and (2) initiating a rule making considering expansionof the ban to the entire Sanctuary.Initiating a rule making considering expanding the ban to the entire Sanctuarywas chosen over taking regulatory action with respect thereto in this noticeof final rule, because the notice proposing this rule (52 FR 32563, Aug.28, 1987) and the DEIS/MP did not consider such a ban. A regulatory prohibitionof this magnitude should not be imposed without assessing the protectionto sensitive Sanctuary resources that would be afforded by such a prohibitionand the effect of such a prohibition on this nation's domestic energy reservepotential and on potential lease revenues to the Treasury of the UnitedStates, and without all interested persons having notice and an opportunityto comment.Immediately banning oil and gas activities in the core area by this noticeof final rule is justified given the special environmental sensitivityof the core area and that a ban on oil and gas activities in the core areawas an alternative examined in the DEIS/MP, upon which public comment wassolicited.(3) <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commentators recommended that a proposed oceansewage outfall pipe from the City of Santa Rosa be prohibited because oftheir belief that discharges from the outfall could adversely impact theSanctuary.<T3>Response: </T3>The City of Santa Rosa is considering several sitesfor the disposal of sewage effluent. The plans of the City are in the preliminarystages and the eventual disposal site and the nature of permissible dischargeshave not been decided. NOAA, as manager of PRNMS, is a member of the taskforce set up by the California Regional Water Control Board to determinethe optimal site and nature of the discharges.No sewage can be discharged into the ocean without a permit from the UnitedStates Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued under the Clean WaterAct (CWA). Under andSection; 942.9 of the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaryregulations, since the discharge of sewage into the Sanctuary, and thedischarge of sewage outside of the Sanctuary if such discharge enters theSanctuary and injures a Sanctuary resource, are prohibited under andSection;942.6(a)(1), EPA permits allowing such a discharge are not valid withouta NOAA certification. Thus, if necessary to protect Sanctuary resources,NOAA can impose conditions as a prerequisite of giving its certificationor even deny certification.(4) <T3>Comment: </T3>Many commentators recommended that anchoring on the ridgesand peaks of Cordell Bank be banned to prevent damage to benthic organisms.<T3>Response: </T3>Anchoring on the Bank can destroy or disturb many benthicorganisms by physical impact of the anchor and dragging of the anchor chain.Because at present only a few vessels visit Cordell Bank and anchor onit, anchoring does not now threaten the Bank's resources. However, if anchoringactivities significantly increase, there could be a significant adverseeffect on the Sanctuary's benthic flora and fauna. Accordingly, Article4 of the Designation Document has been expanded to authorize the regulationof anchoring and NOAA intends to monitor anchoring carefully. If anchoringactivities increase and threaten the Bank's resources, NOAA will amendthe regulations to control anchoring. If anchoring is controlled, the controlswould be applicable to only Cordell Bank and the area within the 50 fathomcontour (isobath) surrounding the Bank. This is the area in which the benthicresources are most concentrated and susceptible to anchor and anchor chaindamage.(5) <T3>Comment: </T3>Some commentators were unclear as to whether the Sanctuaryregulations would apply only to Cordell Bank and the area within the 50fathom isobath surrounding the Bank (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the core area of the Sanctuary, consisting of approximately18.14 square nautical miles) or throughout the entire Sanctuary. One commentatorfelt that the regulations should apply only to the core area.<T3>Response: </T3>NOAA stated in Volume II of the FEIS that Article 4of the Sanctuary Designation Document has been revised to eliminate ambiguitiesconcerning the application of the Sanctuary's regulatory program. The DesignationDocument authorizes the regulation of five categories of activities: depositingor discharging of materials or substances; removing, taking, or injuringor attempting to remove, take, or injure benthic invertebrates or algae;hydrocarbon (oil and gas) activities; anchoring; and removing, taking,or injuring or attempting to remove, take, or injure historical or culturalresources.At this time, only depositing or discharging materials or substances; removing,taking, or injuring or attempting to remove, take, or injure benthic invertebratesor algae; and hydrocarbon activities are being regulated. The prohibitionagainst depositing or discharging applies to the entire Sanctuary. In addition,discharges or deposits beyond the boundary of the Sanctuary which enterthe Sanctuary and injure its resources are prohibited. Prohibition of dischargesor deposits outside of the 50 fathom isobath area is necessary to protectthose pelagic or migratory resources (including seabirds and marine mammals)which occur throughout the Sanctuary.The prohibition against the taking of benthic invertebrates or algae appliesonly to the core area. Prohibition within this discrete area is deemedsufficient to protect the unique benthic resources of the Sanctuary foundon the submerged seamount. This prohibition does not restrict commercialor recreational fishing activities. The accidental taking of invertebratesor algae during normal fishing operations would not violate this prohibition.The prohibition against hydrocarbon activities presently also applies onlyto the core area. However, as discussed under the response to comment (2),above, NOAA today is proposing a rule considering banning hydrocarbon activitiesthroughout the entire Sanctuary.At this time, anchoring is not being regulated. If in the future it isnecessary to control anchoring in order to prevent damage to Sanctuaryresources, such regulation will apply only to the core area. This areais where the benthic resources are most concentrated and potentially susceptibleto anchor damage.Also at this time, the taking of, removal of, or injury to or attempt totake, remove, or injure historical or cultural resources is not being regulated.If in the future it is necessary to impose such regulation, it would applyto the entire Sanctuary.(6) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commentator stated that existing regulations madethe proposed regulation prohibiting the discharge or deposit of materialin the Sanctuary was unnecessary. That commentator stated that with theexception of solid wastes the discharge of materials or substances wascovered adequately by existing laws and regulations.<T3>Response: </T3>NOAA disagrees. The regulation prohibiting dischargesor deposits within the Sanctuary complements the existing regulatory system,will enhance the area's overall recreational and aesthetic appeal, andwill help maintain the present water quality in the Sanctuary. While numerouslaws and regulations apply to the disposal of waste in the marine environment,most Federal decisions regarding whether waste may be so disposed are madeon a case-by-case basis. Thus, protection of the complete Sanctuary habitatwould not be certain without prohibiting discharges in an area which protectsthe complete Sanctuary habitat.The CWA provides for a maximum penalty of $10,000 for a single dischargeincident without the initiation of a civil action. This does not providesufficient deterrent for protecting important Sanctuary resources; Sanctuaryregulations provide for a maximum penalty of $50,000.Certain gaps exist in the regulatory framework. The discharge of oil andother hazardous substances in the territorial sea is subject to EPA requirementsunder the CWA and United States Army Corps of Engineers requirements underthe Rivers and Harbors Act (for discharges that might obstruct navigation).These statutes are not sufficient to provide comprehensive protection ofa marine area and do not specifically prohibit certain activities thatmay harm the resources of the Sanctuary, such as the overboard disposalof trash from ships.Beyond the territorial sea, EPA approval is needed for ocean dumping andfor the placement of new ocean outfalls. EPA regulations require EPA toconsider the ecological productivity and sensitivity of any area proposedfor dumping or an outfall. However, such regulations do not guarantee thatEPA will prohibit the disposal of waste in the Sanctuary. Specifically,the provisions of the CWA do not apply to discharges of non-biodegradablesolid wastes such as casual litter. The prohibition in the Sanctuary regulationsis designed specifically to protect the area's important living resourcesfrom the effects of all harmful effluent and solid wastes. In addition,it prevents floating or submerged waste debris (<T3>e.g.</T3>, non-biodegradable plastics) from being deposited in areaswhere animals could eat or become entangled in the debris, possibly lendingto illness or death. Finally, the deposit of non-biodegradable litter reducesthe aesthetic qualities of the Bank and thereby detracts from its recreationalvalue.(7) <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commentators recommended that NOAA consider provisionsto increase shipping safety in the area such as the deployment of specialbuoys, establishment of communication systems, and redirection of vesseltraffic to prevent collision that might result in spills of hazardous materials.<T3>Response: </T3>The United States Coast Guard (USCG) has jurisdictionover shipping safety in United States waters. The USCG has determined thatexisting safety regulations and Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) are adequatefor the number of vessels using the ocean approaches to the port of SanFrancisco Bay in the area around Cordell Bank. This determination was basedon an USCG Port Access Route Study and the fact that while compliance withthe TSS is voluntary, virtually all traffic uses it.The USCG has also initiated the Offshore Vessel Movement Reporting System,an advisory service, to inform mariners of the locations and movementsof large vessels, such as oil tankers, in the ocean approaches to San FranciscoBay, including areas east of Cordell Bank. Participation by mariners isvoluntary, but by monitoring the radio transmissions of vessels, closeencounters and possible collisions between ships may be avoided. NOAA willcooperate with the USCG in enforcement and surveillance procedures thatrelate to shipping within Sanctuary waters.Under international law, foreign flag vessels in waters beyond the limitsof the United States territorial sea, such as those in the vicinity ofCordell Bank, cannot be regulated directly by the United States Government.Under international law, any regulation of navigation on the high seasmust be endorsed by the International Maritime Organization in order forit to apply to foreign flag traffic.Finally, NOAA has prepared a computerized National Contingency and EmergencyResponse Plan. The plan details alert procedures and responses and describesSanctuary resources at risk. This plan will be expanded to include theCordell Bank area.(8) <T3>Comment: </T3>There was disagreement on the need and extent of possibleregulations of fishing activities. Statements were made that overfishingalready occurred and that ``abnormal'' fishing activities should be banned.In contrast, NOAA also received comments that asked for confirmation thatcommercial and recreational fishing will be excluded from the scope ofSanctuary regulations.<T3>Response: </T3>NOAA reaffirms that no regulation of fishing, otherthan by existing State and Federal statutes, will occur with the designationof the Cordell Bank area as a National Marine Sanctuary. Fishing vessels,however, must comply with the Sanctuary's regulatory prohibition on dischargesand, in the future, could be regulated with respect to anchoring. All Stateand Federal regulatory programs pertaining to fishing, including FisheryManagement Plans promulgated under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation andManagement Act, remain in effect.Sanctuary wardens will enforce the California Department of Fish and GameCode (and Chapter 14 of the California Administrative Code), which regulatesand manages a wide variety of activities affecting the living marine resourcesfound in the territorial sea and in the 200-mile wide exclusive economiczone. In addition, NOAA will continue to monitor the status of fisheryresources around Cordell Bank.(9) <T3>Comment: </T3>Commentators requested that the regulations be revisedto protect any historical or cultural artifacts that may be found withinthe Sanctuary.<T3>Response: </T3>NOAA agrees that it is necessary to protect and manageany historical or cultural artifacts that may be in the Sanctuary. Whilethe presence of any such resources on Cordell Bank or in its surroundingwaters is not known, such resources could exist. Therefore, Article 4 ofthe Designation Document has been expanded to authorize the regulationof the taking of, removal of, or injury to or attempt to take, remove,or injure cultural or historical resources.The Act and NOAA's National Marine Sanctuary Program Regulations (15 CFRPart 922; 53 FR 43802, Oct. 28, 1988) require that the management systemfor a National Marine Sanctuary be established by a Designation Documentand by implementing regulations. Activities may be regulated only to theextent authorized in the Designation Document. Under section 304(a)(4)of the Act, the Designation Document may be modified only by the same proceduresby which the original designation was made. Thus, the Designation Documentserves as a constitution for the Sanctuary by establishing the purposeof the Sanctuary designation; the characteristics of the area that giveit conservation, recreational, ecological, historical, research, educationalor aesthetic value; and the types of activities subject to regulation bythe Secretary to protect those characteristics.The Designation Document for the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaryfollows:<ITAG tagnum="85">Designation Document for the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary</ITAG>Preamble Under the authority of Title III of the Marine Protection, Research, andSanctuaries Act of 1972, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1431 <T3>et seq. </T3>(the ``Act''), the Cordell Bank and its surrounding watersoffshore northern California, as described in Article 2, are hereby designatedas a National Marine Sanctuary for the purpose of protecting and conservingthat special, discrete, highly productive marine area and ensuring thecontinued availability of the ecological, research, educational, aesthetic,historical, and recreational resources therein. Article 1. Effect of Designation The Act authorizes the promulgation of such regulations as are necessaryand reasonable to protect the characteristics of the Sanctuary that giveit conservation, recreational, ecological, historical, research, educational,or aesthetic value. As used in the Act, this Designation Document, andthe Sanctuary regulations, the word ``historical'' includes cultural, archaeological,and paleontological. Article 4 of this Designation Document lists thoseactivities requiring regulation now or which may require regulation inthe future in order to protect Sanctuary resources. Listing of an activityauthorizes but does not require its regulation. Therefore, the listingof an activity does not imply that the activity will be regulated in thefuture. However, if an activity is not listed it cannot be regulated, excepton an emergency basis for no longer than 120 days where necessary to preventimmediate, serious, and irreversible damage to a Sanctuary resource, withoutamending Article 4 to list the activity. Such an amendment can only beaccomplished by following the same procedures through which the originaldesignation was made. Article 2. Description of the Area The Sanctuary consists of a 397.05 square nautical mile area encompassedby a boundary extending at 180anddegrees; from the northernmost boundaryof the Point Reyes-Farallon Islands National Marine Sanctuary (PRNMS) tothe 1,000 fathom isobath northwest of the Bank, then south along this isobathto the PRNMS boundary and back to the northeast along this boundary tothe beginning point. The precise boundaries are set forth in the regulations.Article 3. Characteristics of the Area That Give it Particular Value Cordell Bank is characterized by a combination of oceanic conditions andundersea topography that provides for a highly productive environment ina discrete, well-defined area. In addition, the Bank and its surroundingwaters may contain historical resources of national significance. The Bankconsists of a series of steep-sided ridges and narrow pinnacles risingfrom the edge of the continental shelf. It lies on a plateau 300-400 feet(91-122 meters) deep and ascends to within about 115 feet (35 meters) ofthe surface. The seasonal upwelling of nutrient-rich bottom waters to theupper levels of the Bank stimulates the growth of planktonic organisms.These nutrients, combined with high light penetration in Bank waters andwide depth ranges in the vicinity, have led to a unique association ofsubtidal and oceanic species. The vigorous biological community flourishingat Cordell Bank includes an exceptional assortment of algae, invertebrates,fishes, marine mammals and seabirds. Article 4. Scope of Regulation <ITAG tagnum="81">Section 1._Activities Subject to Regulation </ITAG>The following activities may be regulated within the Sanctuary and adjacentwaters to the extent necessary and reasonable to ensure the protectionof the Sanctuary's conservation, recreational, ecological, historical,research, education or aesthetic values: a.

TheMP includes a detailed breakdown, by program area, of agency roles andresponsibilities. The Sanctuary goals and objectives as set forth in theMP are:Resource Protection The highest priority management goal is to protect the marine environmentand resources of the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary. The specificobjectives of resource protection efforts are to: _Prevent damage to the resources by promulgating regulations to protectthem from the adverse effects of harmful effluents and solid wastes andfrom being injured, removed, or taken by divers; _Establish cooperative agreements and other mechanisms for coordinationamong the agencies participating with NOAA in Sanctuary management; _Develop an effective and coordinated program for enforcement of Sanctuaryregulations; _Promote public awareness of, and voluntary user compliance with, the regulationsthrough an interpretive program stressing resource sensitivity and wiseuse; and _Reduce threats to Sanctuary resources raised by major emergencies throughcontingency and emergency-response planning. Research The goal of Sanctuary research activities is to improve understanding ofthe Cordell Bank environment and resources and to resolve specific managementproblems, some of which may involve resources common to both the Bank areaand the nearby PRNMS. Research results will be used in interpretive programsfor visitors and others interested in the Sanctuary, as well as for resourceprotection. Specific objectives of the research program are to: _Establish a framework and procedures for administering research to ensurethat research projects are responsive to management concerns and that resultscontribute to improved management of the Sanctuary; _Initiate a monitoring program to assess environmental changes as theyoccur; _Identify the range of effects on the environment that would result frompredicted changes in human activity; _Incorporate research results into the interpretive program in a formatuseful for the general public; and _Encourage information exchange among all the organizations and agenciesundertaking research in the Sanctuary to promote more informed management.Interpretation The goal of interpretive programs is to improve public awareness and understandingof the significance of the Sanctuary and the need to protect its resources.The management objectives designed to meet this goal are to: _Provide the public with information on the Sanctuary, its goals and objectives,with an emphasis on the need to use these resources wisely to ensure theirlong-term viability; _Broaden support for the Sanctuary and Sanctuary management by offeringprograms suited to visitors with a range of diverse interests; _Provide for public involvement by encouraging feedback on the effectivenessof interpretive programs, collaboration with Sanctuary management staffin extension and outreach programs, and participation in other volunteerprograms; and _Collaborate with other organizations to provide interpretive servicescomplementary to the Sanctuary program. Visitor Use The Sanctuary goal of visitor management is to encourage commercial andrecreational use of the Sanctuary compatible with the primary goal of resourceprotection. Specific management objectives are to: _Provide relevant information about Sanctuary regulations, use policiesand standards; _Collaborate with public and private organizations in promoting compatibleuse of the Sanctuary by exchanging information concerning the commercialand recreational potential of the Sanctuary; and _Assess the current levels of use and monitor use over time to identifyand control potential degradation of resources and minimize potential userconflicts. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Regulations </ITAG>The regulations prohibit a relatively narrow range of activities, establishprocedures for issuing permits to conduct otherwise prohibited activitiesfor a narrow range of purposes, and set forth the maximum per day penaltyfor conducting a prohibited activity without a permit. Specifically, the regulations add a new Part 942 to title 15, Code of FederalRegulations. Section 942.1 sets forth the statutory authority for the designation ofthe Sanctuary and for the issuance of the regulations. Section 942.2 sets forth as the purpose for designating the Sanctuary:protecting and conserving the highly productive area of Cordell Bank andits surrounding waters and ensuring the continued availability of the ecological,research, educational, aesthetic, historical and recreational resourcestherein. Section 943.3 and Appendix I following andSection;942.10 set forth the boundariesof the Sanctuary. Section 943.4 defines various terms used in the regulations. ``Person''is defined to mean any private individual, partnership, corporation, orother entity; or any officer, employee, agent, agency, department or instrumentalityof the Federal government, any state or local government, or any foreigngovernment. ``Sanctuary'' is defined to mean the Cordell Bank NationalMarine Sanctuary. ``Injure'' is defined to mean to change adversely, eitherin the long- or short-term, a chemical or physical quality or the viabilityof a Sanctuary resource. ``Sanctuary resource'' is defined to mean a livingor non-living resource of the Sanctuary that contributes to its conservation,recreational, ecological, historical, research, educational, or aestheticvalue. Other terms appearing in the regulations are defined at 15 CFR 922.2.Section 942.6 prohibits three types of activities and thus makes it unlawfulfor any person to conduct them. However, any of those activities couldbe conducted lawfully if necessary for national defense; if necessary torespond to an emergency threatening life, property, or the environment;or pursuant to a permit or certification issued under andSection;942.8 orandSection;942.9 by the Assistant Administrator for Ocean Services and CoastalZone Management of NOAA. The first type of activity prohibited is depositing or discharging fromany location within the boundaries of the Sanctuary materials or substancesof any kind, except for fish, fish parts and chumming materials (bait)produced and discarded during routine fishing activities conducted in theSanctuary and water (including cooling water) and other biodegradable effluents,specified in andSection;942.6(a)(1)(i)(B). Depositing or discharging, fromany location beyond the boundaries of the Sanctuary, materials or substancesof any kind except for the exclusions discussed above is also prohibitedif such deposit or discharge enters the Sanctuary and injures a Sanctuaryresource. The second type of activity prohibited is attempting to remove, take, orinjure or removing, taking, or injuring benthic invertebrates or algaelocated on Cordell Bank or within the 50 fathom isobath surrounding theBank. Section 942.5 allows all activities to be conducted in the Sanctuary(subject to all other prohibitions, restrictions, or conditions imposedunder any other program) except for those activities prohibited in andSection;942.6.The third type of activity prohibited is oil and gas activities on theBank or within the 50 fathom isobath surrounding the Bank. Section 942.7 sets forth the maximum statutory civil penalty per day forconducting a prohibited activity_$50,000. Each day of a continuing violationconstitutes a separate violation. Further, <T3>in rem </T3>actions against any vessel used in conducting a prohibitedactivity are statutorily authorized. Regulations setting forth the administrativeprocedures governing the assessment of civil penalties, enforcement hearingsand appeals, permit sanctions and denials for enforcement reasons, andthe issuance of written warnings appear at Part 904, Title 15, Code ofFederal Regulations.   Section 942.8 sets forth the procedures for applying for a permit to conductan otherwise prohibited activity in the Sanctuary and the criteria governingthe issuance or denial of such permits. Permits are granted by the AssistantAdministrator for Ocean Services and Coastal Zone Management if he or shefinds that the activity will further research related to Sanctuary resources,further the educational or historical value of the Sanctuary, further salvageor recovery operations in or near the Sanctuary in connection with a recentair or marine casualty, or assist in the management of the Sanctuary. Indeciding whether to issue a permit, the Assistant Administrator may considersuch factors as the professional qualifications and financial ability ofthe applicant as related to the proposed activity, the appropriatenessof the methods and procedures proposed by the applicant for the conductof the activity, the extent to which the conduct of the activity may diminishor enhance the values for which the Sancturary was designated, and theend value of the applicant's overall activity. Section 942.9 states that all permits, licenses, approvals, and other authorizationsissued pursuant to any authority are valid within the Sanctuary subjectonly to the prohibitions set forth in andSection; 942.6 Other authorizationsallowing the discharge or deposit of materials or substances otherwiseprohibited under andSection; 942.6(a)(1), or the removal, taking, or injuryof, or attempt to remove, take, or injure benthic invertebrates or algaeotherwise prohibited under andSection; 942.6(a)(2), are valid if certifiedby the Assistant Administrator as consistent with the purpose of the Sanctuaryand having no significant effect on Sanctuary resources. The certificationmay impose terms and conditions to ensure consistency. Section 942.10 sets forth the procedures governing appeals of the grant,denial, conditioning amendment, suspension or revocation of permits bythe Assistant Administrator. <ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Information</ITAG>Executive Order 12291NOAA has concluded that these regulations are not ``major rules'' withinSection 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 because they will not result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state or local government agencies or geographic regions: or,(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.These regulations prohibit only a narrow range of activities in a relativelysmall portion of the seas. These regulations also (1) establish procedureswhereby permits to conduct an otherwise prohibited activity could be appliedfor and obtained for a narrow range purposes, and (2) set forth the maximumper day penalty for conducting a prohibited activity. Thus, these regulationswill have little or no direct or indirect economic impact and no adversedirect or indirect environmental effects.Regulatory Flexibility ActThe General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the ChiefCounsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration when these regulationswere proposed that if they were adopted as proposed they would not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.While the proposed regulations were changed to prohibit hydrocarbon activitiesin the core area, there are no hydrocarbon activities ongoing or plannedin that area. Given that the core area is only approximately 18.4 squarenautical miles, that the Bank itself does not appear to be an area of highoil reserves, that the Bank would be difficult to drill due to its granitecomposition, and that the core area is of special environmental sensitivity,it is unlikely the Department of the Interior would ever lease any partof the core area for hydrocarbon exploration or development. The possibilityof the core area being leased and all the requisite permits, licenses,and approvals being obtained is too remote upon which to base a conclusionthat the prohibition on hydrocarbon activities in the core area would havea significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities.As a result, neither an initial nor final Regulatory Flexibility Analysiswas prepared.Paperwork Reduction ActThese regulations contain a collection of information requirement subjectto the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. No. 96-511)approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control Number 0648-0141.Public reporting burden for the collection of information is estimatedto average 1.5 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send commentsregarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of the collection ofinformation, including suggestions for reducing this burden to: JosephA. Uravitch, Chief, Marine and Estuarine Management Division, OCRM, NOS,NOAA, 1825 Connecticut Ave., NW., Washington DC 20235, and to the Officeof Information and Regulatory Affairs, Paperwork Reduction Project (0648-0141),Office of Management and Budget, Washington DC 20530. National Environmental Policy ActIn accordance with section 304(a)(2) of the Act and the provisions of theNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370(a)), a DEISwas prepared for the designation and the proposed regulations. As requiredby section 304(a)(2) of the Act, the DEIS included the resource assessmentreport required by section 303(b)(3) of the Act, maps depicting the boundariesof the proposed designated area, and the existing and potential uses andresources of the area. The DEIS was made available for public review onAugust 28, 1987, with comments due on October 12, 1987. Public hearingsto receive comments on the proposed designation were held in Bodega, California,on September 29, 1987, and in San Francisco, California, on September 30,1987. All comments were reviewed and, where appropriate, were incorporatedinto the FEIS and these regulations.Exective Order 12612This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment under Exective Order12612.Executive Order 12630 This rule does not have takings implications sufficient to require preparationof a Takings Implications Assessment under Executive Order 12630. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 942</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Environmental protection, Marineresources, National resources.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Federal Domestic Assistance Catalog Number 11.429 Marine SanctuaryProgram)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 19, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John J.
