John Warner, R-Va. ``He did not in any way strikea note of finality.''   Warner and other legislators said they didn't know whether Bushwould support building a mobile version of the MX, would back thesmaller Midgetman missile, or some combination of the two.   Bush discussed the issue with House and Senate members of bothparties. He convened the group, along with his top foreign policyadvisers, in what he intends to use as an occasional chance toconsult with them on general foreign policy, his staff said.   The missile question is part of an effort to build new weaponsfor the land-based leg of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Bush's optionsare to base new 10-warhead MX missiles on rail cars, a systemfavored by Air Force generals, or develop a new single-warheadmissile known as the Midgetman, to be housed on trucks.   The Midgetman is far more costly, with a price tag of nearly $24billion for 500 single-warhead missiles, compared to $5.4 billionfor the same capability on the multi-warhead MX, according to AirForce estimates.   The United States currently has 50 MX missiles based in silos inWyoming and Nebraska, in addition to the multi-warhead Minutemanmissiles.   The Soviets have deployed two mobile systems, the SS-25 with onewarhead and the SS-24, with 10 warheads.   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, said ``Those of us who think it's important to have aMidgetman in the package got to make our case. If the president'smade his mind up, he didn't reveal it.''   Aspin said he argued that the issue is ``critically important''for achieving a strategic arms reduction treaty with the Soviets.   The Bush administration is engaged in an overall review ofnational security and foreign policy.   Members of Congress who met with Bush didn't fault the WhiteHouse for that long process.   `This is a new administration. It's a new Congress. I don't knowwho came up with the idea that President Bush could just simplymove in and everything would be right on track and there would beno review no slowdown,'' said Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairmanof the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ``They're not takinganything at face value or past value. I find that very comforting.''</TEXT></DOC>
