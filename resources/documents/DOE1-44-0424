A sum-bottleneckpath algorithm is developed that permits the efficient solution of manyvariants of this problem under some constraints on the structure of thepartitions. In particular, the following problems are solved optimallyfor a single-host, multiple-satellite system: partitioning multiple chain-structuredparallel programs, multiple arbitrarily structured serial programs, andsingle-tree structured parallel programs. In addition, the problem ofpartitioning chain-structured parallel programs across chain-connectedsystems is solved under certain constraints. All solutions for parallelprograms are equally applicable to pipelined programs. These resultsextend prior research in this area by explicitly taking concurrency intoaccount and permit the efficient utilization of multiple-computer architecturesfor a wide range of problems of practical interest.</TEXT></DOC>
