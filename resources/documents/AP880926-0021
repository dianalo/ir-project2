Nodecision is made without the enlisted men,'' said Serge Gilles,co-leader of the Patriotic Unity Bloc, a coalition of threedemocratic political parties.   The army purge began Sept. 17, when enlisted men and theirsergeants ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, the head of government.They replaced him with Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who as a brigadiergeneral had been the army's top administrative officer.   The soldiers sacked dozens of commanders at units across thecountry. Avril endorsed their action and said 29 superior officerswere retired.   The sergeants who engineered the coup share dailydecision-making with Avril, but they have promised to respect thechain of command under their newly appointed leaders, mostlyyounger junior officers.   ``We are thankful to these nation-builders,'' Louis Roy,co-writer of the 1987 Constitution, said of the soldiers. ``(Avril)must not forget that they are watching him and will punish anydeviation.''   Soldiers speaking on radio stations identify themselves withHaiti's oppressed poor and speak of human rights, democracy, freeelections and re-establishing the constitution abolished by Namphy.   ``The army is the people and the people are the army,'' was therebellion's slogan.   An important motive of the mutiny was the desire to improveliving and working conditions. Most soldiers earn less than $200 amonth and live with their families in the city's wretched slums.Now they are demanding higher pay, subsidized housing, and medicaland pension benefits.   Corrupt officers such as Col. Gregoir Figaro, police chief ofthe capital, Port-au-Prince, have been replaced by youngprofessional officers such as the new police commander, Lt. Col.Georges Valcin, who was trained in a French police academy.   A survivor of the upheaval is Col. Jean-Claude Paul, commanderof the feared 700-man Dessalines Barracks, the only major unit inwhich soldiers did not mutiny.   A Western diplomat said privately that Paul, who was indicted inMiami on charges of drug-running, is popular because he is notarrogant, treats his troops well, and ``spreads money around to hismen.''   The soldiers said they chose Avril as president because he ishonest and treats them with respect.   During the 29-year family dynasty founded by Francois ``PapaDoc'' Duvalier and inherited by his son, Jean-Claude, the army wasshunted aside, stripped of its traditional power and humiliated bythe arrogant Tonton Macoutes, the Duvalier private militia.   When Jean-Claude Duvalier was ousted and fled to France on Feb.7, 1986, the Macoutes were officially disbanded. The repressivearmy high command of Duvalier appointees remained largely intact,taking over the Macoutes' lucrative contraband and drug-smugglingactivities and siphoning off public funds.   Francois Duvalier, a quiet country doctor the army expected tomanipulate, rose to power in 1957 in military-rigged elections.Instead, he used the Tonton Macoutes to terrorize the populationinto submission and loosen the army's grip on power.   In the early 1960s, Duvalier closed the military academy andexiled, retired or shot scores of army officers considered a threatto his power.   Professional officers either opted to collaborate with thedictator or were forced into submission. A low-ranking, illiterateMacoute wielded more power than an army officer.   When Jean-Claude Duvalier took over as president-for-life uponhis father's death in 1971, he reopened the military academy. Thegraduates soon discovered they had no chance of promotion in anofficer corps clogged by Duvalierists, who remained in power evenafter the dictator's departure.   ``If an army is a disciplined group of men in arms, there is noHaitian army,'' a major said in an interview shortly beforeNamphy's ouster. ``What we have are more or less discordant centersof authority ... infiltrated by criminal elements,'' he said.   Rank-and-file soldiers, already envious of officers' salaries ofup to $3,500 a month for a general, were provoked into rebellionwhen thugs, many of them former Macoutes, attacked worshipers at aSunday morning Mass in a Roman Catholic Church on June 11, killing13 and wounding 77.   Presidential Guard Sgt. Joseph Heubreux, the 27-year-old leaderof the coup, said the enlisted men were disgusted by the massacreand other acts of violence under Namphy and felt humiliated whenthe outraged public accused them of siding with the killers.   Heubreux, speaking in full battle gear on national televisionthe night of the coup, said the soldiers' goal was ``to raise theprestige of the Haitian people, degraded by so many acts which haverevolted our conscience.''</TEXT></DOC>
