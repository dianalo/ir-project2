The independent oil refiner said it paid a 19-member bank group $275 million plus two subordinated notes totaling $100 million and 500,000 common shares. Tosco also assigned to the banks a contingent promissory note from a third party, which it didn't identify.    Tosco, which has been hurt by falling oil prices and narrowing profit margins from refining, had a net loss of $23.3 million in the first nine months of the year on sales of $612.8 million. The company has restructured its bank loan agreements several times in the past three years.    As part of the latest agreement, Tosco said, the banks ended their debt and equity holdings in the company, which had included $389 million of debt, $212 million of Series B and Series C preferred and warrants to purchase more than 21 million common shares. </TEXT></DOC>
