The D/sup 0/ decay modes used are D/sup0/ -andgt; K{pi}, K3{pi}, and K{pi}({pi}/sup 0/). The data, which correspondto an integrated luminosity of 300 pb/sup -1/, were collected by theHigh Resolution Spectrometer at PEP. Spin density matrix elements forthe D/sup */ meson are measured as a function of the energy sharing variableZ/sub D//sup */. There is no evidence for alignment of D/sup */ mesonsproduced in e/sup +/e/sup -/ annihilation at our energy.</TEXT></DOC>
