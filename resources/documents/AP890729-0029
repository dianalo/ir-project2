The typhoon swept across Japan earlier Friday, killing three andleaving hundreds of thousands without electricity before headingfor the Korean peninsula.   In South Korea, it followed five days of torrential seasonalrains that already had left thousands homeless and dozens dead insouthern areas. The combined toll from floods and rains this weekwas 85 killed and 47 missing, said the Disaster Center. Nationwide,about 112,000 people were homeless, it said.
