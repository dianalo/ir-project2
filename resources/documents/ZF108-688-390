 Their are several problems unique to the issue oflicensing multimedia rights.andP;  Rights holders have yet to figureout a value of multimedia rights for their property.andP;  Also, TV andmovie licensing fees are traditionally based on the idea that theywill be used by a mass audience; in contrast, many multimediaprograms will be aimed at only a few people.andP;  Drafting andreviewing multimedia contracts also takes time and money.andP;  Manymore multimedia licensing contracts will have to be worked outbefore the process becomes routine.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Multimedia TechnologyLicensingPolicyCopyrightContractsNegotiationLegal IssuesTelevision ProgramsMotion Pictures.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>They've got multimedia dead to rightsandM;Multimedia publishing could certainly make good use of material alreadyproduced by the movie and TV industry.andP;  But without a change in licensingpolicies on the part of existing rights holders, it may be hard to realizethat potential in practice.andM;That was the point argued quite cogently last month at the Seybold DigitalWorld conference by Bob Stein, president of The Voyager Company of SantaMonica, Calif.andP;  According to Stein, whose company publishes videodiscreleases of both cinematic classics and original multimedia productions, it'sextraordinarily difficult to license portions of existing movie and TVmaterial for inclusion in new multimedia projects.andM;Licensing problems.andP;  The problems, Stein said, are several.andM;andgt;No consensus on value.andP;  There's no consensus on how much the use of anextract or clip should be worth, nor even on any rational basis for settingthat value.andP;  While a studio might have an established price forrebroadcasting a movie or using a short clip as part of a commercial, mosthaven't yet figured out how to price multimedia rights.andM;Partly, that's because multimedia publishing is new.andP;  Rights holders &quot;keepthinking it might be worth something,&quot; said Stein, but they don't know how tofigure out how much.andM;Determining value also is more complicated because multimedia presentationsare not viewed the same way as linear productions.andP;  What do you do if theclip is only going to be visible in an interactive presentation if the usermakes certain choices?andM;andgt;Different audience.andP;  Furthermore, Stein explained, the film and videoindustries operate on a price scale largely set by mass distribution tomillions of people, while multimedia budgets are based on considerablysmaller audiences.andP;  As a result, he said, the numbers each side thinks arereasonable may not even be in the same ballpark.andM;andgt;Transaction costs.andP;  Studios and networks consider their libraries keyassets, and they want to protect that material with detailed contracts.andP;  Butdrafting and reviewing a detailed contract takes time.andM;Even with an in-house legal staff, reviewing a proposed deal costs thecompany money.andP;  At most studios there's usually a backlog of legal work.andO;Unless they feel they're going to get a lot more back, rights holders justdon't want to bear those costs.andM;One result, Stein recounted, is that he often can license the right torepublish an entire movie -- a standard deal the studios are used to doing --for less than the cost of licensing the use of a five-minute extract fromthat same film.andM;A changing situation.andP;  There is reason to hope the situation may be changing.andO;Roberta Cairney, an attorney at Cooper, White andamp; Cooper in San Francisco, whocounts rights holders such as Lucasfilm Ltd. as well as multimedia developersamong her clients, told me that buying and selling multimedia rights isbecoming a standard transaction in her office.andM;Developers can help the process along, she said, by making requests as simpleand straightforward as possible.andP;  If you want to license rights to asequence, write a brief letter to the rights holder and attach a shortsuggested agreement.andP;  As a rough guide, reviewing and approving such adocument should take less than an hour.andM;&quot;From the point of view of the rights holder, there's not much tolerance fornegotiation for small projects,&quot; she said.andM;Clearly, Stein and Cairney have had very different experiences in this field.andO;But the differences highlight why we need a lot more deals to make licensingfor multimedia publishing as ordinary as buying stock photos or securing theright to perform a stage play.andP;  More deals will establish market prices andgive everyone involved a chance to develop practical policies and stockforms.andM;But the best course, say most developers, is a standard license and singleagency for rights.andP;  That would be ideal, Stein said, but it doesn't lookimminent.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
