<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-10-0230 </DOCNO><TEXT>Synchrotron-radiation photoemission data show that the valence-band discontinuitiesof CuIn/sub x/Ga/sub 1-//sub x/Se{sub 2}-Ge and Cu/sub x/Ag/sub 1-//subx/InSe{sub 2}-Ge interfaces are independent of x within the experimentalaccuracy of 0.1 eV. We argue that this result is consistent with theWei-Zunger explanation of the breakdown of the common-anion rule, whichis based on a substantial role of the cation d states in determiningthe valence-band-edge position.</TEXT></DOC>
