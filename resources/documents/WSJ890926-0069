In the year-ago quarter, the independent oil and gas producer had net income of $2 million, or two cents a share, on revenue of $316 million. Oryx, formerly the Sun Exploration andamp; Production Co. unit of Sun Co., was spun off on Nov. 1, 1988.    Under the pact, Oryx sold its interests in about 107 oil and gas fields in 12 states to American Exploration Co. of Houston. The properties have combined oil and gas production of nearly 10,000 equivalent barrels a day and represent about 3% of Oryx's domestic proved reserves. Proceeds will be used for investments, Oryx said. </TEXT></DOC>
