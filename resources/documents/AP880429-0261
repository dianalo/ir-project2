JOHN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   A 199-year-old proposed constitutional amendment that woulddelay pay raises that members of Congress give themselves untilvoters have a say is being spurred toward Washington by a collegestudent who says he's tired of the ``sneaky'' way the pay hikes nowcome about.   The amendment has been approved by 23 state legislatures. Askedwhat will happen if the required three-fourths majority of statesratify it, a congressional researcher replied, ``I don't know.''   ``It's a sleeper,'' said West Virginia legislator DavidMcKinley, who this year added his state to the roll call of thoseratifying the amendment. Georgia also approved it in 1988.   The amendment, first proposed in 1789 by the framers of theConstitution as part of a 12-amendment Bill of Rights, states: ``Nolaw varying the compensation for the services of the senators andrepresentatives shall take effect, until an election ofrepresentatives shall have intervened.''   By 1791, six states had ratified it: Maryland, North Carolina,South Carolina, Delaware, Vermont and Virginia. The bandwagonstalled until 1873, when Congress bestowed on itself a whoppingraise and Ohio ratified the amendment. Wyoming approved it 1978.   Then, in 1982, along came Gregory Watson, a University of Texasstudent who was researching a term paper on the death of the EqualRights Amendment when he was sidetracked ``by this little book thatsaid five or six amendments never had been ratified.''   In the dustbin with the congressional pay proposal wereamendments allowing slavery, prohibiting U.S. citizens fromaccepting titles of nobility and outlawing child labor.   ``With the December 1981 fiasco still fresh in my mind _ whenCongress gave itself a special tax break which no other Americanwould enjoy _ I thought, `Gregory, why don't you try to get thisratified?'''   Watson mailed letters to state legislators. In Maine, then-stateSen. Melvin Shute wrote back.   The next year, Shute introduced a resolution ratifying the 1789amendment. ``Boom, it passed,'' Watson said.   Excited by success in Maine, Watson sent more letters and foundmore legislators willing to propose resolutions backing theamendment.   Colorado joined in 1984, followed by South Dakota, NewHampshire, Arizona, Tennessee and Oklahoma in 1985. New Mexico,Indiana and Utah ratified in 1986, and Montana, Connecticut andWisconsin in 1987 _ when Congress gave itself two pay raises.   Ratification resolutions have been introduced in every state butArkansas, Watson said.   ``I think the average American feels the way I do,'' Watsonsaid. ``You shouldn't begrudge a member of Congress from getting afair wage. What I object to is the sneaky, tricky, cutesy way theyhide these raises.''   He referred to last year's maneuvering, in which the Senate andthen the House made token votes refusing $12,100 pay raises andthen pocketed the money. Consumer advocates attacked House SpeakerJim Wright, D-Texas, for delaying the vote until its results nolonger mattered.   Congress had already given itself a 3 percent increase lastyear, to compensate for inflation. Members of Congress now make$89,500.   ``I think people are disgusted with the Congress,'' said Georgiastate Sen. Paul Coverdell, who helped ratify the amendment in hisstate this year. ``Greg Watson has made an obsession out ofrectifying the situation.''   Not everyone feels so strongly.   Even James Madison, who made the pay stricture part of hisproposed Bill of Rights, argued for it somewhat half-heartedly _possibly a reason why it isn't among the 10 amendments that becamethe Bill of Rights.   ``I do not believe this is a power which in the ordinary courseof government will be abused,'' Madison said, ``... but there is aseeming impropriety in leaving any set of men without control toput their hands in the public coffers.''   West Virginia legislator James Humphries, calling the resolution``frivolous,'' tried to kill it in committee.   ``It's as moldy as 6-month-old bread!'' he contended.   Kansas state Rep. Robert H. Miller has refused to let theresolution out of his Federal and State Affairs Committee.   ``We consider tinkering with the U.S. Constitution prettyserious stuff. I'm not going to do it based on the word of some guyfrom Texas,'' said Miller, who called the amendment a ``non-issue.''   Opposition to the amendment is fueled by self-interest, saidGeorgia's Coverdell. Before this year's success, his attempts toachieve ratification were blocked in committee for three years.   ``I guess the committee members all hoped to be in Congress,''he said.   Nonetheless, he said, ``It's like apple pie and motherhood.Nobody was willing to oppose it. But I can tell you I got nosupport.''   What happens if Watson's amendment wins ratification in therequired 38 states and gets to Washington?   ``I don't know,'' said David Huckabee, a Congressional ResearchService analyst. But the amendment, which has no deadline, is boundto be a sore spot, he said.   ``If Congress chooses to not accept the ratification becauseit's so old, there's a question of whether you could get enoughlegal footing to get it into court. It's possible that the courtsmight not want to enter into the fray,'' Huckabee said.   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., backs the issue,``but I have some question as to whether the courts would upholdsuch an old amendment since some of the ratifications are soancient.''   If need be, Byrd said, he will re-introduce the measure toensure courts uphold it.   Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif., is trying to do just that inthe House, but his amendment remains in the House JudiciaryCommittee, said his aide, John Doherty.   ``I think it's basically self-interest,'' Doherty said of theopposition. ``It's amazing how little support there is for this,but nobody (publicly) opposes it.''   Rep. William Ford, D-Mich., who chaired the House committeeendorsing the last raise and who was quoted as saying the raise was``too damn little,'' remains silent on the amendment.   ``I'm not certain if he cares to say anything on this,'' saidhis aide, Tom Joyce.   Although Watson, now 25, said he received a ``C'' on his termpaper from a professor who didn't think the amendment was much ofan issue, Huckabee saw a broader meaning in the student's efforts.   ``This is quite a civics lesson,'' he said, ``that one personcan make a difference.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, May 2</NOTE></DOC>
