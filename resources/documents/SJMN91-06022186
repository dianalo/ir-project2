In passing the law,Congress estimated that 43 million Americans had one or more physical ormental disabilities.;    The law prohibits discrimination in general terms.The rules, scheduled to take effect next January, specify how thousands ofbusinesses must consider the needs of the disabled in new construction.;   The rules would not require immediate changes in existing buildings. But ifany portion of a building is remodeled or renovated, that portion would haveto be made accessible to disabled people. Under the rules, a building couldnot be altered in any way that made it less accessible.;    The rules, to bepublished today in the Federal Register, are full of detail. Here are someexamples:;    (check) Disabled people, including those in wheelchairs, musthave full access to all checkout aisles in grocery and other retail stores.;   (check) At least 5 percent of the tables in restaurants and libraries must beaccessible to people with disabilities, and two-thirds of the eating areashould be accessible.;    (check) A new mathematical formula must be used tocalculate how long elevator doors must stay open to accommodate people who usewheelchairs, walkers or crutches.;    Businesses say they fear the costs ofcompliance could be high. But Lawrence W. Roffee, executive director of theU.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, theindependent agency that drafted the rules, said, &quot;We don't think accessibilityis expensive.&quot;;    The features needed to make a building accessible todisabled people increase total construction costs by less than 1 percent, hesaid, and that increase is more than offset by the new business made possiblewhen disabled people have full access to the building.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ROBERT PEAR, New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910122  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  375  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday January 22, 199100022186,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
