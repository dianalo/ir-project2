Expectations that the U.S. will report another large merchandise trade deficit Friday, when it releases data for November, helped keep the dollar under pressure yesterday. But the U.S. currency remained well above the record lows it reached around the end of 1987, before major central banks acted to prop it up through concerted market intervention.    Traders said the Bank of Japan bought small amounts of dollars as the currency fell in Tokyo trading yesterday. The U.S. Federal Reserve was rumored to have intervened to support the dollar in New York dealing, traders said.    &quot;Whether they actually intervened or not is immaterial because their message to the market (that the major governments don't want to see the dollar go lower) is very clear,&quot; James T. McGroarty, vice president, foreign exchange, at Discount Corp. of New York, said.    While speculation about the November trade data continued to affect exchange rates, the oil-price outlook also played a substantial part. An article in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, quoting industry officials, said Saudi Arabia expects oil prices to fall to $15 a barrel, about $1.50 below current levels, possibly by the end of this month. The prospect of cheaper oil benefited the Japanese yen the most because Japan is almost totally dependent on imports for its oil.    The dollar was quoted at 127.38 yen in late New York trading, down 0.9% from 128.50 late Monday. The U.S. currency's drop against the West German mark was less sharp, as it fell to 1.6325 marks from 1.6400.    In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar continued to decline. At midday, the dollar was quoted at 127.05 yen, down from 127.27 yen at the opening.    Weak oil prices traditionally create downward pressure on the dollar for several reasons. Lower oil prices reduce the global demand for dollars because oil generally is priced in dollars. They also hurt the U.S. oil industry, as well as the U.S. banking system, which has large energyrelated loan portfolios.    &quot;People look on the yen as a 'reverse petrocurrency,' &quot; Charles A. Spence, vice president, foreign exchange, at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said.    As a result, the yen also strengthened against other major currencies as dealers bought yen through &quot;cross trading,&quot; or the buying and selling of two non-dollar currencies.    The mark fell 0.4% against the Japanese currency to 78.03 yen from 78.35. The British pound, which is usually harmed by oil-price declines because of Britain's exports of North Sea crude oil, slumped 0.6% to 232.28 yen from 233.74.    The dollar also was pressured by rumors that Friday's U.S. trade report will show that the deficit widened in November from October's record $17.63 billion. Forecasts by market economists, however, remained around $15 billion.    Some traders say the dollar is headed for a sharp drop if the deficit exceeds these forecasts. They argue that recent central bank intervention has lifted the dollar to levels not justified by economic factors.    &quot;We've seen an unusually strong dollar which has been the result of contrived intervention,&quot; Discount Corp.'s Mr. McGroarty said. &quot;If the trade number is worse than expected, the market will attack the central banks and attack them aggressively.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.20 an ounce to $480.70 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 2.6 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $481.55 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                  Late New York Trading                  Tuesday, Jan. 12, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
