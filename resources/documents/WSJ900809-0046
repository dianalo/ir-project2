The administrator, Frank H. Wohl, blamed New York Cityauthorities for much of the problem. Mr. Wohl, appointed by afederal judge in 1988 in response to allegations by the U.S.government that the market is dominated by organized crime,accused the city of being afraid to enforce the law in themarket.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Although the city of New York has ample authority toregulate the Fulton Fish Market, that authority is almostentirely unexercised,&quot; Mr. Wohl said in his midterm report tofederal Judge Thomas Griesa. &quot;The city has abdicated many ofits municipal responsibilities in the market to whateverforces choose to exercise control.&quot;   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan sued to take overthe fish market in 1987 because of racketeering allegations,but Judge Griesa rejected that request. Instead, he appointedthe administrator, whose job is to investigate the market forany signs of mob influence and to help enforce a court orderagainst racketeering and extortion by any of the privatecompanies that do business at the market.   Mr. Wohl also has some rule-making powers. Frustrated withthe city, he said he soon will propose his own regulations todiscourage extortion by unloaders at the market. He alsoasked federal prosecutors to pursue fraud charges againstcertain wholesalers.   &quot;To a large extent the racketeering activity in the FultonFish Market simply fills a void left by the absence of anylegitimate organizing authority in the market,&quot; Mr. Wohl saidin the report. &quot;The result is a frontier atmosphere, in whichthe prevailing attitude is that the Fulton Fish Market is asovereign entity where the laws of economic power andphysical force, not the laws of New York City, prevail.&quot;   Mr. Wohl said the city is even afraid to enforce trafficrules in the market, located near Manhattan's financialdistrict downtown. Instead, the workers make and enforce therules -- allegedly beating a motorist in the face a few weeksago with loading hooks, for instance, after a dispute. Mr.Wohl said that even though the incident occurred on a streetcrowded with market workers, no witnesses could be found whenpolice investigated.   Mr. Wohl listed several areas in which the city has failedto exercise its authority. Businesses in the market operatewithout valid leases, licenses or permits as required by law,he said.   Mr. Wohl said in the report, &quot;City officials haveexpressed a concern that city employees wouldn't be safeperforming their functions in the market, and thatlaw-enforcement officers detailed to protect the cityemployees would be subject to the corrupting influence of themarket.&quot;   A spokesman for New York Mayor David Dinkins couldn't bereached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
