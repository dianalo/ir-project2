This requiresa knowledge of the refractive index profile behaviour both as a functionof dose and as a function of subsequent annealing. The paper reportsmode measurements on a variety of waveguides formed by He/sup +/ ionimplantation with different dose levels, ion energies and implant temperatures,and their subsequent isochronal anneal. Refractive index profiles arededuced using different wavelengths and index orientations, and the growthand recovery curves of the nuclear and electronic regions are comparedfor the two materials.</TEXT></DOC>
