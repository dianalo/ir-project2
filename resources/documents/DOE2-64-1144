<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-64-1144 </DOCNO><TEXT>This is the third annual report on domestic crude oil and natural gasproved reserves prepared by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).It is the first to include estimates of natural gas liquids proved reserves.The requirements to develop these data are contained principally in theDepartment of Energy Organization Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-91) andthe Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-275). Asof December 31, 1979, US proved reserves were 29,810 million barrelsof crude oil, 6,615 million barrels of natural gas liquids (includinglease condensate), and 200,997 billion cubic feet of dry natural gas(excluding gas in underground storage). These reserves levels reflecta continued decline of the Nation's working inventory of oil and gas.The estimate of 1979 crude oil proved reserved reported by the AmericanPetroleum Institute (API) is approximately 9.3 percent lower than theEIA estimate. The estimate of 1979 dry natural gas proved reserves reportedby the American Gas Association (AGA) is approximately 5.5 percent lowerthan the EIA estimate. The estimate of 1979 natural gas liquids provedreserves reported by the AGA is approximately 14.4 percent lower thanthe EIA estimate. 20 refs., 2 figs., 28 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
