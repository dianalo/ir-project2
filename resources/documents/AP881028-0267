But the Taylor is Larry Champagne's specialty. He drives a towtruck and, as they say in the trade, business is picking up. He satthe other day in his Chevron station and pointed out the highway'slatest victim: a van with a crushed roof and shattered windows.   ``He was passing a motor home on a curve, got over too far, andt-h-p-p-t, into the river,'' he said. Champagne was happy to haulthe van and its uninjured driver back to Tok, for $700.   A 1984 legislative study found that 60 percent of Alaska highwayswere in fair to poor condition. But the potholes and frost heavesdon't slow the flow of vacationers. Growing herds of tourists notonly keep Champagne smiling but also help fuel debate over thisfrontier state's transportation future.   More roads! say business leaders who see a young and developingstate with little access to remote villages and mineral deposits.   Stop the bulldozers! cry environmentalists who see a pristineland needing protection from the forces that paved over the lower 48states.   The arguments likely will continue as long as there are placespeople cannot drive to, and much of Alaska fits that category. Thestate's 11,600 miles of roads are concentrated in the southeasternquarter, leaving vast areas untracked.   One-fourth of Alaska's half-million residents live unconnected byroad to the outside world. Of 151 incorporated communities, 133 areunconnected, including the state capital of Juneau.   Given the mountains and permanently frozen ground that cover muchof Alaska, it's a wonder roads were ever built.   Turn-of-the-century gold rushes spurred the first majorconstruction. In World War II, concerns about a Japanese invasionprompted another building frenzy; the 1,520-mile Alaska Highway,Alaska's first overland link to the lower 48, was finished in justnine months.   Since statehood in 1959, expansion has continued steadily. Thelatest road, completed this summer in northwestern Alaska, is a54-mile link from the coast to a mineral deposit known as Red Dog.   ``I try not to think about that,'' said Susan Alexander, staterepresentative for the Wilderness Society, which unsuccessfullyfought the road's route through Cape Krusenstern National Monument.   She said wilderness is easily destroyed by roads and resultingdevelopment and pollution. She cited the 416-mile Dalton Highway,built in 1974 to link Fairbanks and the Prudhoe Bay oil fields.Although only the highway's southern half is open to the public, laxenforcement lets many drivers slip through to the north, andAlexander worries about the effect on wildlife.   ``Increased access means increased poaching, and there definitelyhas been poaching along the road. The road lets in people, hunters,who wouldn't have been there otherwise,'' she said.   Letting more people into Alaska is what economic boosters havehad in mind for years. Wherever roads have gone, tourism hasfollowed. U.S. Customs officials say 38,150 vehicles _ about 70percent of them motor homes and campers _ entered the state on theAlaska Highway last year.   Roads can cut shipping costs to villages and make remote miningmore competitive, say the boosters, who over the years have proposeddozens of roads to fill blank spaces on the map.   In 1977, travel guides called the 152-mile Elliott Highway nearFairbanks the ``Road to Nome,'' even though it dead-ended, and stilldoes, 500 miles short of the Bering Sea town.   In 1986, the Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce suggested aroad that would head 200 miles southwest from Denali National Parkto McGrath, then swing north another 200 miles to the Yukon River.   In southeastern Alaska, plans surface occasionally to connectJuneau to highways that now stop in Haines and Skagway.   But such projects, each estimated to cost hundreds of millions ofdollars, are distant dreams for state officials who can barely raisethe $52 million needed each year to maintain existing roads.   Alaska's oil-dependent government has grown cautious since theoil boom busted, and the state Department of Transportation plans nomajor highway expansion. It would cost $600 million just to bringAlaska's rural highways up to standards, said Ron Lind, the agency'splanning and budget director.   Patterns of land use and ownership also discourage road-building.National parks, preserves and monuments now cover 50 million ofAlaska's 375 million acres. Natives, protective of open space neededfor subsistence hunting and fishing, own 44 million acres.   But things could change quickly in Alaska's boom-bust economy. Aspublisher Robert Henning wrote in an Alaska Geographic book called``Adventure Roads North'':   ``Strong anti-roads sentiments of environmentalist groups haveslowed Alaskan road construction, but in the history of the North,there has ever been the cry for `more roads, more trails,' and it isinevitable that the road building will continue. ... Like it or not,it seems to be the American way.''   Wherever and whenever roads are built, the likes of LarryChampagne will be there to pick up the pieces. Back at the Chevronstation, Champagne was smiling again; a Winnebago driver was in forthe second time that day with a flat tire.   Champagne quickly fixed the tire and proceeded to the cashregister. ``That'll be $10,'' he said. ``You have a nice day.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   David Foster is the AP Northwest regionalreporter, based in Seattle.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Oct. 31</NOTE></DOC>
