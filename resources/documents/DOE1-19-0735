The influence of their variation on the solutions of Bohr collectiveHamiltonian describing even-even nuclei is then discussed. The resultingcollective wavefunctions are coupled to one quasi-particle states todescribe odd nuclei. Finally, the validity of the nucleon-nucleon forcein use, is assessed from a thorough study of the spectra of some selectedodd-odd nuclei.</TEXT></DOC>
