The gun provision passed by voice vote. But James Jay Baker,chief lobbyist for the National Rife Association, said his groupwill try to separate the waiting-period amendment from the overallbill, and force a separate vote on the provision before the fullHouse.   Other key portions of the drug bill would:   _Restrict the availability of chemicals used to refine cocaineor make dangerous drugs such as amphetamines and PCP.   _Create a cabinet-level drug czar to develop and carry out anational anti-drug strategy.   _Authorize $1.75 billion in 50-50 matching grants over the nextfour years for state and local anti-drug enforcement efforts.   _Deny most federal benefits to persons with two or moreconvictions on drug offenses unless they complete a rehabilitationprogram.   _Establish a mandatory five-year prison sentence for possessionof ``crack'' cocaine in certain circumstances.   The handgun waiting period would allow local police time toconduct a background check into criminal records or a history ofmental incompetency _ but such a search would not be required bythe legislation.   The provision would leave intact any state law that is strongerthan the federal language, but supercede weaker laws. Twenty-twostates have waiting periods, with California's the longest at 15days.   A purchaser could be exempted from the waiting period bypresenting a certificate from police stating that the purchaser'slife was threatened.   The waiting period was sponsored by Rep. Edward Feighan, D-Ohio,and supported strongly by law enforcement groups and Sarah Brady,wife of presidential press secretary James Brady _ who was shotwith a handgun during the 1981 assasination attempt on PresidentReagan. The police groups said drug dealers would purchase weaponsin states with weak gun laws.   ``We will be incapable of making substantial headway in our waragainst drug trafficking unless we are also prepared to disarm drugdealers and drug traffickers and drug users,'' Feighan said.   The provision withstood a challenge from Rep. Bill McCollum,R-Fla., who attempted to substitute an amendment requiring that asystem be developed to identify felons who attempt to buy firearms.   The McCollum substitute was defeated, 22-12.   ``I'm delighted, thrilled, very proud of the JudiciaryCommittee,'' Mrs. Brady said after the committee vote. An officialof Handgun Control Inc., she told reporters, ``I think this ensuresthat we're going to see this enacted this year. And I think it'sgoing to save lives.''   Rep. Michael DeWine, R-Ohio, said the waiting period is``clearly going to provide a cooling-off period, but it is going tobe a hit-and-miss situation under our current situation.''   Baker, the NRA lobbyist, said, ``We don't think that waitingperiods work. We think that law-abiding citizens will be the onlyones affected and criminals will continued to evade the law.''   A similar waiting-period bill sponsored by Sen. HowardMetzenbaum, D-Ohio, is pending in the Senate Judiciary constitutionsubcommittee.</TEXT></DOC>
