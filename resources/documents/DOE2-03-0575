Air and CO/sub 2/ jets were arranged in two configurationsto vary their relative interactions with the propane jet. In the firstconfiguration, CO/sub 2/ jets were located on an inner hexagon and airjets were arranged on an outer hexagon surrounding the propane jet. Inthe second configuration their positions were reversed. With these configurations,it was possible to localize the interaction of CO/sub 2/ jets to thenear-burner region and that of air jets to the far-burner region of thepropane flame in the first configuration, and reverse them in the second.The following quantities were measured: liftoff, reattachment, and blowoutvelocities, temperature, concentrations of NO, NO/sub x/, CO, and O/sub2/, and radiative emission. Substantial differences in these measurementswere found between the two configurations and they have been discussedin terms of the flow interactions. An estimation of the changes attributableto simple dilution by the surrounding gases on the exhaust concentrationsis also presented.</TEXT></DOC>
