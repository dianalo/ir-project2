Macy andamp; Co. pressured makers of children's clothing not to sell their wares to the company's Kids &quot;R&quot; Us subsidiary.    In a suit filed in federal court in Manhattan, the Rochelle Park, N.J., toy and apparel retailer charged that Macy's sought &quot;to force certain children's swimwear manufacturers to boycott and refuse sales to (Kids &quot;R&quot; Us) in an attempt . . . to fix retail prices and unfairly restrict competition.&quot;    Toys &quot;R&quot; Us seeks an order stopping Macy's from engaging in the alleged activity, plus at least $4 million of damages, which would be trebled under antitrust law.    Officials of Macy's, the big retailer based here, couldn't be reached for comment.    In 1983, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us sued, charging Federated Department Stores Inc. and General Mills Inc. with trying to prevent General Mills' Izod Ltd. unit from selling its clothing to Kids &quot;R&quot; Us. That litigation and counterclaims filed by Federated later were dropped. </TEXT></DOC>
