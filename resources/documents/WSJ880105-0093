The response was the strongest by shareholders to a British company's offering in recent months. In the wake of October's stock-market crash, holders have taken up less than 50% of most other new-share issues.    Williams holders applied for 49,950,000 shares at the offering price of 185 pence ($3.47) apiece, out of a total of 54,050,000 shares valued at #99.9 million ($187.4 million). The balance of the shares will be bought by institutional investors.    The company issued the stock to help finance its #133 million purchase of Berger, Jenson andamp; Nicholson Ltd., a maker of paint and home-care products, from Hoechst AG of West Germany. </TEXT></DOC>
