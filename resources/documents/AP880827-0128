Elizabeth Morgan, who holds the keys toher own freedom in the knowledge of her daughter's whereabouts.   Although she has committed no crime, on Sunday Dr. Morgan, ofMcLean, Va., who holds degrees from Harvard, Yale and Tufts, willmark her first anniversary in a solitary cell at the District ofColumbia Jail.   D.C. Superior Court Judge Herbert B. Dixon Jr. ordered herjailed indefinitely on contempt of court charges until she producesher 6-year-old daughter, Hilary, the centerpiece of a bitter battlebetween Morgan and her former husband, oral surgeon Eric Foretichof Arlington, Va.   The thought of giving up ``would not cross my mind,'' said theslightly eccentric, articulate Morgan in a recent interview. ``I domy share of crying ... but I cannot think of a more sinful thing todo than trash (Hilary) for my personal comfort.''   Morgan, 41, hid the girl one year ago rather than allow Hilaryto have unsupervised visits with Foretich, whom she calls``unstable, unpredictable, and violent.'' Morgan claims Foretichhas been sexually abusing the girl _ and her half-sister from aprevious marriage _ since before Hilary was 2.   Morgan's claims have been buttressed by the 4th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals in Virginia, which recently directed a lower courtto examine previously inadmissable testimony from doctors andpsychiatrists that Hilary has been sexually abused.   That court has been hearing civil suits _ including Morgan'sdamages suit against Foretich and his countersuit of defamation _because the couple lived in Virginia during their marriage. Butsince Morgan is now a Washington, D.C. resident, Dixon hasjurisdiction over the custody case. And he has refused to rule onthe allegations of sexual abuse.   Foretich agrees that his daughter has been molested, but he saysit was Morgan who committed the atrocities against his daughter.``It's sick,'' he said.   Although Foretich recently agreed to supervised visits with hisdaughter, were she to be found, Morgan refuses to allow it underany conditions except at the request of Hilary and her therapist.   ``I don't see why a child should have supervised visits withtheir rapist,'' she said. ``I think that's sick.''   Foretich, whose voice becomes forceful with emotion whendiscussing the case, says he doesn't believe the authorities aretrying hard enough to find his daughter. He's offering a $2,000reward to whoever finds Hilary, who turned 6 last week.   ``If Elizabeth Morgan really loved this child, why would she puther off somewhere away from both parents?'' he asked.   Morgan says Hilary is safe and doing well, but will say nothingmore.   ``I don't tell anybody anything to do with her,'' she said.``For me to risk her safety is to risk her life,'' she added,explaining that Hilary has been occasionally suicidal and would notbe able to handle more court battles and forced visits with herfather.   ``It would certainly be the end of her sanity.''   Foretich doesn't agree. ``She loved being with me; she wanted tobe with me ... Hilary and I have been the victims of all this,'' hesaid.   The bitter divorce and custody battles have been dragging onsince 1982, when Morgan left Foretich's Great Falls, Va., home aweek before Hilary was born. The mother was granted custody andForetich received liberal visitation rights.   Morgan first reported that Hilary was being abused in 1984. Twoyears later she refused to let Foretich visit his daughter.Morgan's current jail term marks the third time she has beenincarcerated for contempt.   Dixon has ruled that Morgan could remain in jail until Hilaryturns 18. Lawyers are appealing that decision.   Former Maryland Attorney General Stephen Sachs, one of Morgan'sattorneys, says the purpose of contempt of court jailings is tocoerce a person to divulge information, and it's obvious Morganwill not reveal her daughter's whereabouts.   ``If the goal is to punish her ... she has the right to atrial,'' Sachs said.   The attorney also complains about the secretive nature ofMorgan's legal proceedings and wants future hearings to be public,with no evidence or testimony supressed.   Experts in the child abuse profession say it is unusual for amother to go to jail for so long to protect a child. But childabuse cases are often entrenched in ambiguities.   ``In general, cases of sexual abuse are very hard to try andvery hard to prove,'' said Anne Cohn, executive director of theChicago-based National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse.``So in that sense, Dr. Morgan's case is not unusual.''   Local child abuse experts generally believe Morgan's story,``not that they necessarily believe what she's done is the rightthing,'' said Joan Danzansky, executive director of theorganization's Washington chapter.   ``In the end it's the rare child who isn't better off havingsome sort of relationship with both parents,'' Cohn explained.   The National Organization for Women has lobbied in Morgan'sbehalf and a support group called ``Friends of Elizabeth Morgan''has staged a high-publicity awareness campaign aimed at securingher release.   About 50 of Morgan's supporters staged a demonstration Saturdayoutside the District of Columbia judicial complex, and NOWPresident Molly Yard told the group that women ``are themselvesbeing abused when they try to protect their children.''   Morgan herself has gone public with her situation, makingpersonal appeals that have been published in The Washington Postand U.S. News andamp; World Report. She has also taken advantage of herjail time to publish a textbook on cosmetic surgery, write severalshort stories and complete a children's book.   She finds inspiration from philosophical, historical andreligious reading. She cites ``Civil Disobedience'' by Henry DavidThoreau ``where he maintains that the law is wrong if it calls fora citizen to be unjust to another citizen'' and William Shirer's``The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' because ``there areseveral common elements (in child abuse and Hitler's Nazi Germany)on a path of unopposed injustices.''   She also spends time thinking about her future with Paul Michel,a judge on the Federal Circuit Court, to whom she became engagedjust before she was jailed last August. The couple doesn't plan tomarry immediately after Morgan's release, however.   ``We've decided to wait until the child is protected and canreturn and become part of her new family from the start,'' Michelsaid.   As for Foretich, he believes the outcome of the case is out ofhis control.   ``I've put in the hands of the Lord,'' he said. ``I pray forsome resolution through him, and that some sanity will eventuallyprevail in this case.''</TEXT></DOC>
