(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Seven months after the murder of Oregoncorrections chief Michael Francke, his brothers are pressingauthorities to develop their theory that corrupt prison officialsconspired to have Francke killed.   Little information has surfaced on the killing since Francke wasstabbed in the heart outside Corrections Department headquartersJan. 17.   No arrests have been made, but the death is still very much inthe news.   Francke's brothers, Patrick, 46, and Kevin, 36, have found anally in Phil Stanford, a columnist for The Oregonian newspaper inPortland who has devoted nearly two dozen columns to the Franckeslaying.   Stanford said he thinks there's a good possibility the slayingwas part of a conspiracy to prevent Michael Francke from exposing an``organized criminal element'' in the prison system that wasinvolved in drugs and corruption.   ``I think it's something that any good investigator has to lookat again and again,'' said Stanford, who worked as a privateinvestigator in Miami in the early 1980s.   Allegations of official corruption have irritated governmentofficials, including Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, who at one pointdismissed Stanford's columns as ``b.s.'' and ``garbage.''   The man in charge of the investigation, Marion County DistrictAttorney Dale Penn, said Stanford and the Francke brothers haveproduced no substantiation for their conspiracy theory.   ``There's nothing wrong with raising it, but they've gone waybeyond raising it,'' Penn said. ``They're saying, `This is whathappened.'''   Police said Francke, 42, was attacked at about 7 p.m. as he wasleaving work and walking to his car.   Mortally wounded, Francke made it back to the Dome Building, theprison department headquarters, where he broke a glass pane in adoor before collapsing.   An hour later, late-working colleagues found Francke's car, onedoor ajar, in the parking lot. But it wasn't until five hours laterthat a security guard found Francke's body.   Penn has said Francke may have been killed while interrupting acar burglar. The death may also have been revenge for some aspect ofFrancke's law enforcement work; he had been running the Oregonprisons for about two years after heading the New Mexico prisonsystem.   The Francke brothers have rejected those scenarios from thebeginning, and through interviews and daily contacts with sourceshave kept constant pressure on authorities to investigate thealleged conspiracy.   Patrick Francke, a printing press salesman who lives in Lenexa,Kan., said he thinks his brother was killed after he ``found somepeople in administrative positions within the system who werebreaking the law.''   ``I think somewhere along the line, there was a confrontation,''he said.   Kevin Francke, who owns a construction company in Port Charlotte,Fla., said he firmly believes corrections officers or administratorswere involved in his brother's death.   His brother told him he had uncovered ``an organized criminalelement'' and was going to make that information public, KevinFrancke said. But proving that theory will be difficult.   ``It's a very well-run network,'' he said. ``It's like trying toput IBM out of business.''   Penn said his office will continue to study the conspiracy angle,``but we still have not uncovered one witness or one piece ofevidence that would establish or corroborate'' the theory, he said.   Penn also expressed concern that Stanford's columns on thesubject would make potential witnesses reluctant to talk withinvestigators for fear of their identities becoming public.   Stanford rejected that criticism, saying Penn was the one who hadcreated a climate of rumors by refusing to divulge details of theslaying.   ``The case is of great interest to everyone in the state,''Stanford said. ``It's an extremely interesting mystery, and Iwouldn't be doing my job if I didn't write about it.''</TEXT></DOC>
