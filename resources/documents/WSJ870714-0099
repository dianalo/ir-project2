Canadian banks currently have provisions averaging about 15% of their loans to 34 less-developed countries including Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. The loans total about 25 billion Canadian dollars ($18.9 billion).    In the statement, Mr. Mackenzie said it's &quot;expected&quot; that the additional provisions will be made as soon as accounting details and tax treatment for the increased reserves &quot;have been clarified.&quot; Whatever new provisions the banks and superintendent agree on will become mandatory for all domestic Canadian banks.    A spokeswoman for the Canadian Bankers' Association, which represents Canadian banks, said she didn't know whether an agreement was reached on a new level for loan-loss reserves. The superintendent's office couldn't be reached for additional comment.    Bank analysts have predicted that the reserve level will be increased to more than 25% of the loans outstanding to the 34 countries.    The expected increase in Canadian loan-loss reserves was prompted by the increase in such provisions by U.S. banks following Citicorp's announcement May 19 of a $3 billion addition to its foreign and domestic loan-loss reserves. Many major U.S. banks now maintain loan-loss reserves of 25% to 30% for uncertain Third World debt.    The spokeswoman for the Canadian Bankers' Association said that further meetings would be held &quot;soon&quot; between Mr. Mackenzie and the six largest banks -- Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank, and National Bank of Canada.    Canadian banks, until the Citicorp action last May, were ahead of U.S. banks in provisions for Third World loans.    Earlier yesterday, a bank official said the banks might have difficulty reaching agreement on procedures for increasing loan-loss reserves because of different tax consequences for different banks.    The federal government, in a tax-overhaul policy paper released last month, said it plans to makes some alterations in the deductibility of loan-loss reserves for banks. </TEXT></DOC>
