 Thecompany recently began shipping Metamorphosis 1.0, and it is clearly amilestone application for Mac typographers.andP;  Beyond the vanishing issue offont encryption, Metamorphosis resolves a major impediment to working withlaser fonts -- the difficulty of accessing their PostScript outlines.andM;Font butterflies from caterpillars.andP;  Metamorphosis actually has a threefoldpurpose:andM;andgt;Generating editable Encapsulated PostScript outlines of all the charactersin any laser font.andM;andgt;Creating a Fontographer source file from any laser font, thereby allowingfurther modification of its PostScript outlines in Altsys' $495 full-featuredlaser-font design program.andM;andgt;Converting Type 1 fonts into downloadable, unencrypted Type 3 font files.andM;That's all Metamorphosis does, but it's certainly not trivial.andP;  Working withthe program's output in Altsys' Fontographer, Adobe Illustrator or AldusFreeHand, you can stretch the font-manipulation process beyond anythingpossible with programs dedicated to special type effects, such as BroderbundSoftware Inc.'s TypeStyler, SmartArt from Emerald City Software (now owned byAdobe) or Letraset's LetraStudio.andM;Metamorphosis' simplicity of purpose is reflected in its sparse userinterface.andP;  Essentially, there is one program window that lists the fontsyou've chosen to be converted and eight active menu choices besides Quit.andO;You can work with free-standing font files or ones installed in your System.andO;And you can limit font conversion to the first half of the ASCII set --standard uppercase and lowercase letters, numerals zero through nine, andcommon punctuation marks -- to speed up the process and save disk space.andM;We should point out that Metamorphosis is not a total solution to thelaser-font quagmire; it doesn't generate downloadable Type 1 fonts from othertypes.andP;  Therefore, none of the program's output will work with Adobe TypeManager, which actually requires Type 1 encryption to be present.andM;Additionally, if you want to generate Fontographer databases for furthermanipulation and hinting of your new fonts, you can't use a version ofFontographer prior to 3.0.andP;  If you own an older version, you'll have tocontact Altsys for upgrade information.andM;How it works.andP;  Metamorphosis uses a PostScript printer to image the fontdata, which is subsequently sent back to the Mac.andP;  Therefore, the conversionprocess can take quite a while, especially when you've queued up a lot oftypefaces for transformation.andP;  And the printer will be occupied during theentire process and unavailable for other jobs.andM;Fortunately, Metamorphosis can perform its processing in the background underMultiFinder, so your Mac needn't be tied up as well.andP;  A progress indicatorkeeps you informed as the conversions proceed.andM;Metamorphosis requires a Mac Plus or higher running System 6.0.3 or later.andP;  Ahard disk is suggested.andP;  And you must have a laser printer with an AdobePostScript interpreter, such as any of Apple's LaserWriters, on-line.andM;Aside from the speed issue, which is largely a limitation of processing inthe printer rather than a bottleneck caused by Metamorphosis, the programoperates beautifully.andP;  The converted fonts or outlines it generates arevirtually clones of the original font.andP;  There are only a few relatively minortechnical &quot;gotchas&quot; concerning stroked, filled and composite fonts, butthey're adequately covered in the program's notes.andM;The 36-page Metamorphosis manual is all you need for this remarkablyeasy-to-use program.andP;  It is clearly written, handsomely designed,well-illustrated and has a useful explanation of font terminology.andP;  Altsysoffers unlimited technical support, although calls aren't toll-free.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Notwithstanding all the other pivotal changes taking place inthe font world, Metamorphosis is still a significant advance.andP;  Thesedevelopments don't minimize how useful and effective Metamorphosis truly isfor manipulating type.andM;In fact, Adobe's publication of its font secrets earlier this month hasn'tyet delivered benefits to Macintosh users in the form of applications enabledwith Type 1 technology.andP;  Until software developers take full advantage of theAdobe information -- releasing a new generation of programs that deal withType 1 fonts as easily and completely as Type 3 -- Metamorphosis has norivals.andP;  But even after Type 1 font encryption ceases to be an issue, thereverse-engineering, outline-generating capabilities built into Metamorphosiswill keep it an invaluable addition to any Macintosh typographer's set oftools.andM;Altsys Corp. is located at 720 Avenue F, Suite 109, Plano, Texas 75074;
