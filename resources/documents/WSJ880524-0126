Posts Net For 3 Months to March 31 </HL><SO> </SO><IN> ERN CON </IN><TEXT>   KOMATSU LTD., the big Japanese maker of construction machinery, said unconsolidated, or parent-company, net income totaled 2.27 billion yen ($18.2 million) in the three months ended March 31. The company, which has changed its fiscal year so that it ends March 31, didn't provide a year-earlier comparison.    Sales totaled 123.86 billion yen ($992.8 million).    Domestic sales of construction equipment stood at 62.49 billion yen, which Komatsu called a &quot;satisfactory level,&quot; aided by strong spending on public-works projects and private-sector housing investment. Foreign demand for construction machinery was stable in North America and Europe, but overall exports were restrained by sluggish demand in oil-producing nations and developing countries.    Komatsu rose two yen (1.6 cents), to 699 yen, on Tokyo's stock exchange yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
