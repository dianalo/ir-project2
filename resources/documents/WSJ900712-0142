The Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy,based in Palo Alto, estimates that 40% of the state'spopulation is black, Hispanic, or Asian. By 2000, this sharemay rise to half.   Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians are younger thannon-Hispanic whites. As these groups gain share in thestate's population, California will age more slowly than therest of the country. In 2010, its median age will be 36years, compared with 39 years for the U.S. The median agesare nearly identical now.   Youthful, ethnic populations are also more family-orientedthan non-Hispanic whites. Nearly half of Hispanic householdsin California are married couples with children, comparedwith only 24% of non-Hispanic white households. Nationwide,the share of family households, which include single parentsand families without children, is expected to decline to 68%in 2000 from 71% in 1990, while the share of nonfamilyhouseholds and singles rises. But in California, the share offamilies could rise to 70% in 2000 from 68% in 1990.   Hispanics have the largest households in California,averaging 3.82 people, followed by 3.39 people in Asianhouseholds and 2.72 in black. The shrinking group ofnon-Hispanic whites has the smallest households of all, only2.42 people. According to the center, &quot;these trends shouldintensify, and California should become a comparatively morechild-oriented market in the next decade.&quot;                                                                                                          Health Coverage   Often Marked by Gaps                                                                                                          MOST AMERICANS have health insurance. But more than oneout of four don't have it all the time.   A survey by the Census Bureau followed people over a28-month period from 1986 to 1988. Four percent of thepopulation had no health insurance, public or private, forthe entire period. Another 24% had no coverage at least someof the time.   Men were more likely than women to lack health insurancefor one month or more, 30% vs. 27%. And although blacks andHispanics were more likely than whites to be covered byMedicaid, they were more likely to lack health insurance.Thirty-eight percent of blacks had no health insurance someof the time, as did 52% of Hispanics.   A majority of young adults had no health insurance at somepoint over the two-year period, 52%, compared with less than1% of people aged 65 and older.   There are also differences in coverage by family status.Only 23% of people who were in a married-couple family forthe entire survey period went without health insurance formore than one month. Among those who were never in amarried-couple family, 34% went without health insurance forat least a month. Those who changed their family statusduring the survey period were most likely to go withouthealth insurance: 52% of those who spent just part of thetime in a married-couple family lacked health coverage for amonth or more.                                                                                                          Japanese Goods Rank   High With Students                                                                                                          COLLEGE students have a higher opinion of many Japaneseproducts than they do of those made in the U.S.   A Roper Campus Reports study found that college studentsfavor Japanese-made cars and home electronics over those madein the U.S. About three-quarters of students surveyed thinkthat Japanese stereos and televisions are better than thosemade in Europe or the U.S. Half think that Japanese cars arethe best (and 65% of students own cars).   Europe rates second in car quality, with 26% of studentspicking them over Japanese or American cars. Only 18% sayAmerican cars are the best. Students also think that Europeanwatches are superior to all others.   The categories in which the U.S. wins big are sports andapparel. Two-thirds of students surveyed rate American-madecasual clothes tops, and 70% say the U.S. makes the bestsports equipment and athletic shoes. (European bicycles,however, are considered the best.)   The U.S. and Europe tied in dress clothes, with eachgarnering 44% of the surveyed students' preference. Only 2%of students surveyed say the Japanese make the best dressclothes.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          HAWAII may be the best place to be whether you're workingor not, according to 1989 data from the Bureau of LaborStatistics. The state had the lowest unemployment rate in thecountry last year, 2.6%. And many of those who wereunemployed chose to be -- almost 30% quit their previousjobs. That is the highest rate of any state in a tie withConnecticut. . . . According to the Census Bureau's March1989 Current Population Survey, 82% of Hispanic householdshave telephones, compared with 94% of non-Hispanichouseholds. The older and better educated Cuban subgroup ismuch more likely to have telephones -- 92% of Cubanhouseholds do, compared with only 76% of Puerto Ricans and80% of Mexicans. . . . The median cost in the U.S. of a2,400-square-foot suburban house with four bedrooms and 2 1/2baths was $176,000 in the first quarter of this year. In SanJose, Calif., the same type of house cost $497,800, based onan analysis of recent home sales by Runzheimer Internationalof Rochester, Wis. That's more expensive than anywhere elsein the country. San Francisco came in second, followed by LosAngeles, New York, Washington and Boston. The good news (forbuyers) is that in some cases, prices are down from 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
