The panel embraced the measure when it voted 32-20 todefeat an amendment by Rep. Jim Leach (R., Iowa) that wouldhave removed the provision from the administration's broadbill to overhaul bank regulation and to let banks affiliatewith securities firms, insurance companies and commercialcompanies, such as auto makers.</LP><TEXT>   Despite the panel's surprisingly large margin for passage,the proposal will face stiff opposition in the Senate andbefore the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee,which must also consider the proposal. The chairmen of thesepanels share many of the concerns that Rep. Leach raised --that the change would lead to a dangerous concentration ofeconomic power and possibly expand the federal depositinsurance safety net. &quot;It is a prescription for economicdisaster, increasing exposure to the taxpayer and causing amassive concentration of economic resources,&quot; Mr. Leach said.   But proponents of the administration proposal argued thatcommercial companies would bring new capital and managerialtalent to the beleaguered banking industry. Several advocatesalso noted that unless commercial companies were allowed toinvest in banks, U.S. banks would turn increasingly toforeign banks for capital.   The Treasury proposal would set up an elaborateholding-company structure to prevent conflicts of interestbetween banks and their industrial owners. In addition, itwould require industrial companies to make sure that banksmaintain very high capital levels to provide a cushionagainst failure and bailout by the Bank Insurance Fund of theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp.   The Treasury plan requires the establishment of adiversified holding company, which in itself would be encasedin a financial-services holding company. It is through thefinancial-services holding company that banks would beallowed to combine with brokerage companies and mutual funds.   Advocates of the administration plan argued that thecurrent law is out of step with financial reality. Severalcommercial companies, including Ford Motor Co., ownsavings-and-loan institutions. In addition, AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. havelaunched large credit-card operations, while General ElectricCo. offers a wide variety of financial services throughsubsidiaries.   Members of the Financial Services Council, a coalition oflarge brokerage, insurance, banking and industrial companieslobbied hard for the proposal. These companies like theTreasury proposal because it would allow them to combinebanks, brokerage firms, and insurers that can offer packagesof financial services to corporate and individual customers.But Samuel Baptista, the head of the group, said the proposalwill face stiff opposition. &quot;We're a long way from the RoseGarden,&quot; where bills are frequently signed, he said.   After the vote on the Leach amendment, the committee spentmost of the day considering how much latitude to give banksto mesh their businesses with securities and otherfinancial-services firms and how to prevent banks from usingfederally insured deposits to finance risky activities.   After a lengthy debate, the panel rejected on a 28-23 votea proposal by Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) that would haveoverhauled the banking system by limiting the interest ratebanks could pay on deposits and restricting the size of loansthe nation's 300 largest banks could make to large borrowers.The idea behind the &quot;core banking&quot; proposal was to preventbanks from paying higher interest rates to compete forfederally insured funds and then using the funds for lendingto Third World countries, real estate developers andcorporate buy-outs. Under the Schumer plan, such loans couldbe made by bank affiliates with uninsured funds.   Despite broad interest in the proposal, many memberscomplained that it was too radical and needed more study. Inaddition, they worried that the proposal could lead togovernment regulation of how credit is allocated. TheAssociation of Bank Holding Companies, which worked to defeatthe proposal, stressed this and other risks in its lobbyingefforts. Mr. Schumer made it clear that he intends to keeppushing the proposal.   The committee also rejected several attempts to easelending and other barriers between banks and securitiesaffiliates. Many of these &quot;firewalls&quot; had been added at thesubcommittee level.   The panel also adopted an amendment, which was directed atbanks owned by individuals, that would more clearly separatebanking from other businesses the individual might own, suchas real estate or insurance. The provision, backed by Rep.Doug Barnard (D., Ga.), is designed to reduce the impact ofeconomic concentration in small towns, where one person mayown a bank and other businesses.</TEXT></DOC>
