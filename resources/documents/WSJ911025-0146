Should she accompany Christina to school, promise lotsof fun in class or just put her foot down?   The Eastman Kodak Co. administrative assistant sought helpfrom Work/Family Directions Inc. The small Boston consultingfirm coached Ms. Szparaga to uncover the root problem by playacting with Christina. &quot;It turns out the fact that herone-year-old brother got to stay home and she had to goreally bothered her,&quot; says Ms. Szparaga, who lives in EastDetroit, Mich. Armed with this insight, Ms. Szparaga talkedwith her daughter again about the wonders of kindergarten.</LP><TEXT>   Thousands of employees such as Ms. Szparaga get advicefrom Work/Family about issues they once handled at home. Injust eight years, the closely held concern has grown from aneight-person operation with $2 million in revenue to acompany with 160 employees, revenue of $35 million and 80corporate clients, including American Express Co., MobilCorp. and International Business Machines Corp.   Like many businesses, Work/Family has exploited thedemographics of the baby-boom generation -- and now it iscounting on demographic trends to generate yet more business.In the 1980s, the concern pioneered in marketing referralservices so workers could find child care or help with theiraging parents. Now, Work/Family competes with about fourmajor concerns offering similar services nationally as wellas dozens of smaller firms with varying degrees of expertise.   Work/Family again is betting on baby boomers to carve outadditional market niches. Aging boomers with children out ofdiapers and into classrooms can use Work/Family's newschool-advisory service. For boomers who may have waited toolong to bear children, Work/Family recently introducedadoption referral and consultation.   &quot;The nature of this business is change,&quot; says Fran SussnerRodgers, Work/Family's founder and president. &quot;Our strength{is} responding to changing employee demographics and theirimplications for workplace productivity.&quot; Experts say thisstrategy has enabled the innovative firm to keep pace withworkers' latest needs for flexibility in balancing their workand family lives.   The approach has serious pitfalls, however. Frequentservice changes can damage a small company's establishedreputation and strain management's limited resources. &quot;Froman image standpoint, if consumers are used to a company doingsomething really well and then, all of a sudden, it's doingancillary things, that can erode brand {quality} in aconsumer's mind,&quot; says Brian Wansink, professor of marketingat Dartmouth College's Amos Tuck School of Business.   In addition, some companies view Work/Family's services asan extra that can be cut when savings are needed. MerrillLynch andamp; Co. says it recently stopped using Work/Family afterbudget cuts forced the financial-services concern to trimemployee benefits.   Despite such drawbacks though, corporate America seemscompelled to explore novel dependent-care services. &quot;Familiesare something that companies have to pay attention to. If youwant to retain and promote the best and brightest,{dependent-care support} goes a long way in good will,&quot; saysDana Friedman, co-president of Families and Work Institute, aNew York research firm.   Ms. Rodgers, 44 years old, launched a dependent-careconsulting business called Rodgers andamp; Associates out of herWatertown, Mass., home in 1971 as a way to juggle work andtwo toddler daughters. In 1983, IBM asked her to develop anationwide day-care referral service and offered to pay forset-up costs. She renamed her firm and opened an office inBoston.   Pounding the pavement near IBM facilities around thecountry, Ms. Rodgers set up a network of 175 consultants toadvise employees about their communities' variousdependent-care options. Work/Family later began to helpcorporations establish locally run day care centers andcamps, which give priority to staffers' offspring.   By 1988, Work/Family had 40 clients, $15 million inrevenue and its first profit. At Baxter Healthcare Corp. inDeerfield, Ill., Work/Family has received very favorablereviews for its help in advising parents about dependent-careissues and in locating child care and elder-care services,says Alice Campbell, director of work and family programs.The health-care products maker hired Work/Family lastJanuary, seeking an equitable dependent-care program for its38,000 U.S. employees. At a weekly cost of 50 cents peremployee, Work/Family was Baxter's cheapest option, thecompany says.   Work/Family decided to shift its focus as more workersbecame involved in selecting schools than in selectingnannies. &quot;We felt the parental link to education wassomething that needed to be fostered,&quot; says Ms. Rodgers.   Work/Family launched its SchoolSmart program last July.The toll-free phone service offers callers personalized tipsfor successful parenting: how to help kids with homework, howto respond to report cards and what test scores really mean.Its counselors, former teachers and other educationalexperts, can tap a national database to advise employeesabout the quality of their local public and private schools.   Work/Family's research also detected a surging interest inadoption, with more companies offering adoption-leavepolicies for new parents. Work/Family set up another nationaltoll-free line in July so employees can consult with socialworkers about the adoption process. Workers are directed toneighborhood adoption agencies.   Expanding services has created steady growth forWork/Family. But long-term success may be more elusive,especially if the company adds the step-parenting advice andcollege counseling services that it's considering.   Quality can slip when a nationwide empire must juggle amyriad of services. It is a particularly worrisome issue fora small firm that depends heavily on third parties, such asWork/Family's independent consultants. Ms. Rodgers saysWork/Family regularly monitors consultants' quality throughpersonal visits and client questionnaires.   Also, with many corporations slashing costs, few arerushing to embrace new perks such as homework counseling.Work/Family so far has signed up only 15 clients for itsadoption services and 20 clients for its SchoolSmart program.Still, Ms. Rodgers believes that during tough economic times,employee morale is critical and her services can help.</TEXT></DOC>
