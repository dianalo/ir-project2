This is a diluted version of a short-lived 10% tax thatwounded German capital markets and crippled the mark evenbefore it took effect in January 1989.   The new measure's basic points are said to include a 25%rate to align the levy with taxes on regular income, but withgenerous breaks, such as exemptions for nonresidentforeigners and about 80% of German savers and less red tapefor eligible investors seeking to reclaim withheld funds.   The tax would apply to all interest income. Forced toresurrect the disputed levy after a federal court ruledearlier this year that interest income must be taxed in thesame way as regular income, Bonn has aimed to make the tax asbenign as possible for the sake of Germany's capital markets.                                                                                                          PRAVDA SINGS CAPITALIST TUNES                                                                                                          Across the top of its front page, the former CommunistParty newspaper Pravda printed an ad for bank shares. Thiswas the most prominent ad that Pravda, independent since thefailed Soviet coup in August, has published. It claims that&quot;Stocks in the all-Russian Exchange Bank guarantee yoursuccess and are a symbol of your prosperity.&quot; The adplacement was &quot;professionally painful&quot; but financiallynecessary, said Pravda, which has cut staff, delayed pay andappealed for contributions after reopening without its partyassets. Next month, Pravda will close its Tokyo office. Itcan't afford the $5,000 monthly rent.                                                                                                          BRITISH SMALL BUSINESSES UPBEAT                                                                                                          For the first time in three years, small businesses inBritain are optimistic about the future, the Confederation ofBritish Industry said. The employers group's study of 692businesses also found that their outlook for exports hadimproved for the first time since April 1990, though 75% ofthe firms continued to operate below capacity and most werereducing staffs and investments.                                                                                                          CUBA TARGETS ENERGY SAVINGS                                                                                                          Cuba and a Spanish firm formed a joint venture namedCuvastec to introduce energy-saving projects in Cubanindustry. Union Nacional Electrica's Tecenergo unit saidCuvastec, 51%-owned by Havana, would employ Miesa S.A.engineers to upgrade production lines at the ComandanteErnesto Che Guevara nickel plant. The plant, built withSoviet technology, was temporarily closed last year becauseit used too much fuel while Cuba had to implement oil-savingmeasures after a drop in Soviet supplies. Cuvastec planssimilar programs in the Cuban glass and paper industries.                                                                                                          HONG KONG PAY PACE SLOWS   Hong Kong companies' salary increases slowed this year forthe first time since 1988 and may stay subdued next year, HayManagement Consultants Hong Kong Ltd. said. The firm's pollof about 12,000 people at more than 90 major firms found thatpay raises averaged 13.4% this year, following 16% jumps inthe preceding two years.                                                                                                          SEOUL TO BOOST EXPORT LOANS                                                                                                          South Korea will try to boost sluggish exports by raisingexport loans it grants as incentives to small andmedium-sized companies to 650 won (87 cents) from 600 won forevery U.S. dollar of export contracts. The firms receiveloans if they submit letters of credit from foreign buyers.The effective date of the move hadn't been decided. SouthKorea's exports in the first nine months rose 2.1% whileimports surged 23%, producing a record trade deficit of $10.2billion.                                                                                                          EC PUTS PRESSURE ON ITALY                                                                                                          European Community finance ministers put strong pressureon Italy to carry through an ambitious austerity package,hoping to get the country on course for EC monetary union.   Though ministers welcomed Italian plans for drastic cutsin public deficits and inflation, they expressed concern thatthe coalition government might not have the political muscleto implement the unpopular program. Rome was urged to freezesubsidies for five years, cut public-sector pay and alter thebargaining system, privatize enterprises instead of sellingminority stakes, cut pension and social security spending,and reform the tax system.   Separately, the finance ministers in a compromise agreedto end duty-free allowances in mid-1999 -- or 6 1/2 yearsafter the EC's single market is to end border checks and taxbarriers.   EC health ministers toughened rules on tobacco healthwarnings as of mid-1996 and banned sales of &quot;oral-moisttobacco,&quot; a new type of snuff, starting next July 1, butdeferred debate on a proposed ban on all tobacco advertising.
