Government officials and labor analysts said that the worker's death, the first since violent labor disputes began sweeping the nation last month, could worsen the volatile situation at many of Korea's workplaces.    The analysts noted that last week's decision by the Hyundai industrial group to grant worker demands for new unions had marked a turning point in the unrest in terms of management-labor relations. But they said that the behavior of the riot police in coming days will be crucial in determining the outcome of the labor troubles at other companies.    The worker who died, Lee Sok Gyu, was employed at a shipyard on the southern island of Koje. He was one of 3,000 yard laborers at Daewoo Shipbuilding andamp; Heavy Machinery Ltd. who tried to march Saturday toward the Okpo Hotel, where the president of the company was staying. They were protesting a breakdown in negotiations over new worker demands.    Reports said that Mr. Lee died of chest wounds apparently caused by shrapnel from a tear-gas grenade fired by riot police about to be overrun by the marching workers. Daewoo workers barricaded the hospital in which Mr. Lee died, and a police officer was reported to have been badly injured yesterday when he tried to persuade the workers to release Mr. Lee's body for an autopsy in another hospital. The reports said that 4,000 riot police had been sent to Koje and that police yesterday fired tear gas to prevent 1,000 workers from marching out of the shipyard after a protest rally.    Also yesterday, about 2,500 students and workers fought with riot police in Seoul to protest Mr. Lee's death.    The ruling Democratic Justice Party urged restraint and said: &quot;It is regrettable that the protests . . . caused a worker to be killed in the midst of a subsiding phase of recent nationwide labor-management disputes.&quot;    As the labor strife continued, an estimated 1,000 ground workers at Seoul's Kimpo International Airport went on strike Saturday, delaying all flights. The delays continued yesterday as 500 workers walked out again. Workers at 53 of 89 Seoul bus lines also walked off the job Saturday, but service yesterday was reported to have been almost fully restored.    The Labor Ministry reported 541 strikes nationwide, in contrast to the more than 400 job actions reported late last week.    Although the likelihood for futher violence between protesters and police remained unclear, last week's Hyundai settlement &quot;was the big one&quot; in terms of management's relationship with workers, a labor economist at a Seoul university said. &quot;Now that {Hyundai chief} Chung Ju Yong has caved in, the others will follow right along. He was setting an example of stubbornness to the other big bosses.&quot;    Even at the top ranks of Hyundai, there was a recognition that management can't any longer dictate to the workers.    &quot;It's the beginning of a new era in Korea,&quot; said Yoo Chul Jin, a senior vice president of Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., the group's biggest company. &quot;We have no experience with this new union situation. Neither do the workers. We'll all be feeling our way along.&quot;    The Hyundai group, which makes everything from steel coils and rods to giant ocean tankers and passenger cars for the U.S. market, is South Korea's biggest industrial group. In the southern city of Ulsan, it employs one of every six people and provides a living for most of the others.    Mr. Chung, Hyundai's founder and honorary chairman, is a self-made tycoon who was accustomed to ruling his empire like an autocrat. But, associates said, he was unable to resist intense pressure by the government to put an end to the sometimes-violent protest actions last week by more than 40,000 workers.    &quot;He tried to stand firm against the rising tide of worker demands and lost,&quot; one of his senior executives said. After a tentative settlement was reached, the workers returned to their jobs at the end of last week.    Korea's workers apparently believe that the mood of democratization sweeping the nation has given them the opportunity to break down decades-old barriers against unionization. Next to higher pay, the right to form their own union was the most insistent demand made by the Hyundai workers. </TEXT></DOC>
