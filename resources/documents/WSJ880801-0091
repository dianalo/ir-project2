Forget about castigating South Korea for locking out U.S. beef, while welcoming U.S. military protection. A new trade villain is about to take over in Washington: Europe.    U.S. officials worry about signs that the European Community is erecting barriers against American goods and services as it moves toward economic unity in 1992. They also fear that the internal political demands of unification will force the EC to oppose the U.S. on some key issues in the current round of world trade talks -- especially agriculture, services, and subsidies.    &quot;The implications of 1992 for the United States are more serious than people realize,&quot; U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said after a swing through the Continent. &quot;The idea is sound and laudable, but it could lead to a lot of trade disputes.&quot;    Indeed, Mr. Yeutter says, &quot;in the next few years, Europe will be a tougher nut to crack for us than Japan,&quot; traditionally America's most intractable trade rival.    On the surface, such concerns appear badly misplaced. The U.S. lost its trade dominance over the community in 1983, as its overall trade deficit began to soar. But the red ink across the Atlantic was never as large as it was across the Pacific, and the U.S. deficit with the EC through May of this year shrunk to about $4.6 billion from $8.4 billion in the same period last year.    What's more, the U.S. has formally hailed the EC decision to create a unified internal market in 1992. The Reagan Administration has compared it with the pending Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement and officially accepted European pledges that internal unification won't lead to a &quot;fortress Europe,&quot; locking out American and other foreign companies.    The EC's top trade official, Commissioner Willy De Clercq, insisted at the recent Toronto economic summit that &quot;there will be no fortress Europe.&quot; And the community's Ambassador to the U.S., Sir Roy Denman, calls such worries &quot;unjustified hoo-ha.&quot; He adds, &quot;For the community to go protectionist in 1992 would mean shooting itself in the foot&quot; because of the risk of &quot;retaliation from other countries.&quot;    But what worries Mr. Yeutter and other U.S. officials is real or threatened European intransigence in areas where world trade rules are currently weak and vague. Chief among these are agriculture, services and subsidies. The U.S. is trying to create new international rules to prevent protectionism in these areas, but these efforts could touch sensitive economic and political nerves within the EC.    The top trade negotiator contends the community's Brussels bureaucracy is already drafting rules for 1992 that could deny U.S. financial institutions, automakers and other industries equal market access in Europe -- even if they are already doing business there. What's more, he asserts, by adopting such 1992 regulations now, the community may be locking itself into positions in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks which would place it at odds with the U.S. drive to liberalize trade in services.    Even Ambassador Denman admits that, while the community isn't going protectionist, &quot;a different question arises when one looks at items not yet covered by the international trading rules, such as services.&quot; European liberalism on those matters, he hints, may depend on U.S. concessions.    The Reagan Administration is already locked in a bitter struggle with the community over world farm trade. The U.S. wants trade negotiators who are due to meet in Montreal in December to conclude a framework agreement aiming at the complete elimination of farm subsidies. But Mr. De Clercq insists publicly and privately that agriculture subsidies -- an important internal matter in Europe -- can never be eliminated, but only reduced. He wants to focus on short-term rollbacks in subsidies, deferring the U.S. goal of killing them.    And the two sides are slugging it out over another pan-European matter, the four-nation Airbus airliner consortium, which the administration views as an unfair competitor to Boeing and McDonnell Douglas because it is heavily subsidized.    Mr. Yeutter says that even after meeting with EC officials last month, &quot;I just don't know&quot; how many more conflicts may break out before 1992. &quot;They told me they can't be negotiating internally on the new rules and negotiate with us at the same time,&quot; he says. &quot;They are saying, 'Trust us.'&quot;    But the situation, he adds, &quot;makes everybody insecure, and insecurity has a cost in economic activity. There's just going to be a lot of insecurity for everybody until 1992.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
