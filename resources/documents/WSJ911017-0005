In &quot;The Nature of the Firm,&quot; Prof. Coase challenged theprevailing orthodoxy in economics by asking a simplequestion: Why do firms exist? Why are some activitiesorganized within firms, while other activities are organizedacross firms?</LP><TEXT>   Prof. Coase set forth the now uncontroversial propositionthat firms will be formed if the costs of organizingactivities within a firm are less than the costs of marketexchange. Included in these costs, often referred to astransaction costs, are (a) the costs of obtaining informationabout the prices and quality of desired goods, (b) the costsof negotiating contracts, (c) the costs associated withmonitoring performance, and (d) the costs of enforcingcontracts. Prior to &quot;The Nature of the Firm,&quot; economists paidlittle or no attention to transaction costs, despite the factthat a large proportion of an economy's resources are used toarrange and enforce contractual relations.   Prof. Coase's other classic article, &quot;The Problem ofSocial Cost,&quot; showed that legal decisions governing theassignment of property rights have no effect on resourceallocation if transaction costs are low. This proposition,which initially was suggested by Prof. Coase in a 1958article on the Federal Communications Commission, waschallenged immediately by leading scholars at the Universityof Chicago, who invited Prof. Coase (then at the Universityof Virginia) to come and defend this idea. In what Nobellaureate George Stigler has described as &quot;one of the mostexciting intellectual events of my life,&quot; Prof. Coase arguedinto the late evening with 20 leading theorists at theUniversity of Chicago (including two future Nobel laureates-- Mr. Stigler and Milton Friedman), until all were finallypersuaded by the logic of his argument.   &quot;The Problem of Social Cost&quot; successfully challenged theorthodox view of &quot;externalities&quot; (i.e., spillover effects)that had prevailed in economics. The most common example ofan externality was pollution. According to the conventionalview, pollution was a &quot;problem&quot; in need of governmentalcorrection, since firms, in choosing technologies and levelsof output, did not consider the full social costs of theirbehavior.   For example, suppose an oil company could choose one oftwo tankers for carrying oil: the Valdez, which will earn aprofit of $1 billion but cause $500 million worth ofenvironmental damage, or the Good Ship Lollipop, which willearn profits of $750 million and inflict no environmentaldamage. Absent regulation, it was argued, the oil companywould choose the Valdez, since its profits were higher.However, the Good Ship Lollipop is the more sociallydesirable choice, since the combined value of the oil tankerand the environment is higher with this tanker ($750 million)than with the Valdez ($500 million). Since firms purportedlydid not consider the external effects of their own behavior,economists typically argued that some form of governmentregulation was necessary.   Prof. Coase turned this analysis on its head. The&quot;problem&quot; of externalities is not that one party causes harmto the other. Instead, the problem is one of conflict overhow to use a scarce resource. In the case of air pollution,producers wish to use the air to emit pollutants while theneighboring residents wish to breathe fresh air. Using hislegendary method of combing through court decisions, Prof.Coase went on to show that the &quot;problem&quot; of externalitieswould be resolved, without government regulation, in waysthat maximize social value if transaction costs are low, andthat the outcome does not depend on which party receives theinitial property right.   &quot;The Problem of Social Cost&quot; spawned a large body ofliterature that debated the equilibrium tendencies of theimaginary world of zero transaction costs, a development thatProf. Coase found unfortunate. For the major insight of thispaper was not to suggest that we live in this imaginaryworld, but rather to show the conditions under which legaldecisions governing the assignment of property rights doaffect resource allocation. In the above example, if thecosts of carrying out transactions between the polluting firmand the neighbors exceed $250 million, it can be shown thatthe assignment of rights determines the way in whichresources will be used. If the court gives the firm the rightto spill oil to the Valdez, the less desirable outcome willresult. In contrast, if the court gives the neighbors theright to enjoy clean water, the Good Ship Lollipop, the moredesirable outcome, will result.   The &quot;transaction cost&quot; analysis inspired by ProfessorCoase has had substantial effects on public policy in anumber of areas. Perhaps most prominently, the debate overantitrust policy has been affected substantially by therecognition that many business contracts, previously thoughtto be anticompetitive, actually are ingenious devicesdesigned to mitigate a variety of transaction costs. Forexample, many vertical restraints (e.g., exclusivedealerships, resale price maintenance) are contractual meansto allow manufacturers to control product quality at thedistribution and retail level, rather than attempts tomonopolize markets.   Environmental policy has also benefitted from Prof.Coase's analysis. There have been numerous experiments thatestablish an appropriate level of pollution for a geographicarea, and then assign companies transferable rights topollute. Companies that are more efficient in curtailingpollution sell pollution rights to those that are lessefficient.   The transaction cost approach also is relevant tosecurities issues, including the issue of whetherstockholders should be liable to bondholders for the damagethat leveraged buyouts and leveraged recapitalizations do tobond prices. Wisely, the tradition in U.S. corporate law isthat bondholders can contract for protection against theseevents, as they have in recent years with the advent of&quot;poison put&quot; covenants. Imposing a liability on stockholdersactually could increase litigation costs and reduce theoverall gains from these control transactions.   In a speech he gave at a conference in his honor at YaleUniversity a few years ago, Prof. Coase said, &quot;My dream is toconstruct a theory which will enable us to analyze thedeterminants of the institutional structure of production. In`The Nature of the Firm' the job was only half done -- itexplained why there were firms but not how the functionswhich are performed by firms are divided up among them. Mydreams is to help complete what I started some 55 years agoand to take part in the development of such a comprehensivetheory.   &quot;And so, once my present commitments are out of the way, Ipropose to put aside the research projects on which I am nowengaged and to join those economists who are working in thisfield. I intend to set sail once again to find the route toChina, and if this time all I do is discover America, I won'tbe disappointed.&quot;   This time, Prof. Coase, the boat will be overflowing withyour fellow economists.
