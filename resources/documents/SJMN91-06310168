I waslooking forward to renovating an old house. I was also, as a Bay Area native,looking forward to being a part of the rejuvenation of San Jose.;   I knewthat there would be problems. I have suffered through my landscaping beingtorn up and thrown into the street. I have reconciled to the fact there is nodecent grocery store in the entire area. I have made lifestyle adjustments,including getting a big dog, because I have been ripped off three times . . .so far.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DOWNTOWN ISN'T WORKING AS IT SHOULD BE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor.  </MEMO><TEXT>     I tell myself the jets are not getting louder, earlier and later. I try tounderstand that the helicopter that buzzes my house at night is for the goodof all. I even try to deal with the cars speeding up and down my street atnight, running stop signs and slamming into parked cars. I don't even mind theoccasional backup on Julian Street on my way to work when trucks aredouble-parked to drop off supplies at the Rescue Mission. I know this is for agood cause.;   The thing that gets me the most, though, is the dangerous,unnecessary and illegal double-parking that goes on in front of the Oasisnightclub on St. James Street at night. Although there is a white zone there,it is completely ignored. Sometimes the offending vehicles are limousines.Sometimes they are passenger cars. Quite often they are police cars.;   Iunderstand the need for the police to stop for the occasional emergency. But Iam not talking about emergencies here. Usually officers are casually talkingto other officers at the door or to a group of pretty girls. The reason I cantell it is not usually an emergency is because this usually backs up trafficso bad you have plenty of time to see what is going on.;   On Oct. 19 about9:20 p.m., the car in front of me stopped in the traffic lane, and I had to goaround. There were two uniformed officers on the sidewalk blithely watchingpassengers get out. This was the fourth night in a row this had happened to meand I decided it was time to try and do something about it.;   I parked my carin one of the many open spaces on the street and walked back to the club. Iasked one of the officers (the other was talking to someone double-parked infront of the club) for his name and badge number because I wanted to reportthis. He immediately became extremely hostile. He told me that I was &quot;rude&quot;and that he &quot;didn't have to tell me his name or badge number.&quot; He said Ididn't have any proof he had done anything wrong.;   I couldn't really see hisbadge and I was afraid to try to take a closer look. He was really frighteningme. I was more afraid of, and disturbed by, this officer than anything else Ihave come in contact with downtown.;   I realize that I am just a smallhomeowner. I also realize that businesses like the Oasis are important to SanJose. However, we downtown residents do make a very important contribution toSan Jose, and I think we are entitled to more consideration and respect thanwhat we are afforded.;   -- Ron Gardner;   San Jose  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911105  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  584  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, November 5, 199100310168,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
