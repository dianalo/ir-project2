Claiming that the delays, which often reach two years, are unlawful, the companies have received broad support within West Germany's pharmaceuticals industry, the world's third largest after the U.S. and Japan. The companies blame the chronic delays on a tangle of red tape, understaffing and a lack of qualified examiners at the government's health authority, the West German equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.    The industry complains that the delays diminish the chances for successful marketing of new drugs or raise the possibility of competition from generic drugs if licenses are allowed to expire without timely extension. The backlog also delays the return on investment of new drugs.    Herbert Wartungsleben, the industry's attorney in the litigation, said the aim of the suit, which was filed in June, is to get a court order requiring the agency to speed up its decision-making process. The complaint refers to a West German law, uniform in the European Community, requiring the government's health agency to decide on an application within four months, or seven months in exceptional cases.    The agency's president, Dieter Grossklaus, acknowledged this week that he urgently needs additions to his 1,800-member staff. He also complained that his agency is responsible for an unreasonably broad scope of substances claiming to have medicinal properties. </TEXT></DOC>
