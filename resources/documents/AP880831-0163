The White House national security adviser, Lt. Gen. ColinPowell, told members of the House in a letter that President Reaganwill reach a decision on the issue by mid-September.   Transportation Department officials argued at an interagencymeeting last Thursday that allowing China to launch the satellitesaboard its Long March booster would undercut U.S. companies thatare trying to develop an Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV).   The Reagan administration has barred private U.S. companies fromlaunching satellites aboard the Soviet Proton booster. And Congressand the administration have encouraged U.S. firms to develop aone-time booster in the wake of the Challenger shuttle disaster.   The Transportation Department ``has expressed a concern that theapproval of this export license could be to the detriment of theemerging commercial space launch industry that the president istrying to create,'' said a department official, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., said in a letter to the White Housethat: ``Permitting U.S. satellites to be launched on either theProton rocket of the Soviet Union or the Long March vehicle of thePeoples' Republic of China _ both of which are government producedand backed ... would defeat the intent of presidential andcongressional policy.''   ``The artificially low prices offered by these countries areless than half of the cost to U.S. firms to build similarvehicles,'' Solomon wrote.   Solomon's letter to the White House was signed by five otherRepublican congressmen, Jack Kemp of New York, William Broomfieldof Michigan, Robert Walker of Pennsylvania, Jerry Lewis of Calif.,and James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.   Powell replied that the administration was judging applicationsto export satellites for launch by China ``on a case-by-casebasis.''   The State Department favors allowing U.S.-made satellites to goup on the Long March so as not to offend the Chinese, sayadministration sources.   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley told reporters that``because the issue is under review, it is inappropriate for me tocomment at this point.'' Other State Department officials said theissue would be decided by the White House.   The six Republican House members argued that giving business toChina's government-owned and government-subsidized Long Marchbooster program would:   _Jeopardize the jobs of 8,000 Americans involved in developing aU.S. booster.   _``Act to the detriment of our goal of assured access to space''and undercut U.S. efforts to develop a ``reserve fleet'' of launchvehicles ``in time of national emergency.''   _``Result in a one-way street of transferring sophisticated U.S.aerospace technology to the Peoples' Republic of China.''   Two organizations, both foreign, have applied for licenses toexport U.S.-made satellites to China. Aussat, an Austrialiancompany, signed a letter of intent in June with the Hughes AircraftCo. to manufacture two telecommunications satellites.   Asiasat, owned by British and Hong Kong concerns, is negotiatingwith Hughes to refurbish a Westar 6 satellite that was launched bythe U.S. shuttle in 1984, failed to reached the proper orbit, andwas recovered by the shuttle, said Hughes spokesman Don O'Neill.</TEXT></DOC>
