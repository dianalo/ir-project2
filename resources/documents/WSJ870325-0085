Fixed-rate Eurodollar bonds closed down from 1/4 to 1/2 point. Earlier, some long-dated corporate issues had been off as much as 3/4 point.    Many floating-rate notes initially lost ground because of speculation that U.S. interest rates are poised for an increase, traders said. Dated floating-rate notes closed mixed, but perpetuals, which don't have any set maturity date, closed up as much as three points.    Among more active issues, the Chase Manhattan floating-rate notes due May 9, 2000, closed at 97.80 to 97.90, from a low of 97.35 to 97.45. The previous day's close was 97.55 to 97.65.    In new issues, there was strong demand for American Can Co.'s $150 million of 15-year convertible Eurobonds, indicating a 5 1/2% to 5 7/8% coupon at par.    An official at lead manager Morgan Stanley International said the issue was placed shortly after its morning launch. A specialist in equity-linked issues at another house participating in the issue said there was &quot;steady demand&quot; among dollar-based investment accounts because the borrower has a &quot;well-perceived name.&quot;    There also was good demand for another major dollar-denominated issue, Credit National's $100 million of 7 3/8%, five-year Eurobonds. The French lender's bonds apparently benefited from the markets' preference for shorter maturities as well as the guarantee of the French republic. LTCB International Ltd. was lead manager. </TEXT></DOC>
