Robertson's presidential campaign faltered early on, and he hassince endorsed Bush. During the meeting Monday night, Robertsonsaid that he urged backers to be ``good Republicans'' and that hewill formally release his delegates later in the week.   Most delegates who have remained loyal to Robertson haveindicated they will vote for Bush if Robertson asks. An AssociatedPress count gives Robertson 88 delegates. Bush has far more thanthe 1,139 delegates needed for nomination.   But Robertson was moving aggressively to carve out a role inthis week's convention. In addition to the usual circuit oftelevision interviews and receptions, he scheduled meetings withdelegations from Michigan, Iowa, Texas, Washington, Virginia andMinnesota.   Robertson launched his week with a downtown rally where he saidhe ``won't ever surrender'' the conservative views which formed thebasis for his campaign.   ``You and I got into the Republican Party because we believe inprinciples,'' Robertson told backers.   Spokeswoman Marlene Elwell said Robertson will focus on theimmediate goal of pushing for Bush's election during the convention.   ``The message is for them to join him,'' she said. ``We're hereworking for unity. He (Robertson) has pledged his full support.''   ``Let's go fight Democrats,'' Robertson told backers.   ``We're getting ready to show why Republicans should be electednext fall and why George Bush should be elected the next presidentof the United States,'' he said.   Despite his weak showing in the primary season, Robertson toldbackers there was ``marvelous cooperation'' on drafting theconservative platform.   He sent a clear message that he expects Bush to run on thatdocument.   ``Though I withdrew as a candidate,'' Robertson said, ``theideas, the concepts, the principles, the standards that you and Ihave held aloft do not ever quit and they don't ever surrender andwe are going to continue to fight until we see victory in thenation for the things we believe in.''   While Robertson was speaking, a small group of protestersshouted ``bigot go home'' and ``go back to South Africa.'' Therewere a few tense exchanges with Robertson backers, but they werequickly diffused.</TEXT></DOC>
