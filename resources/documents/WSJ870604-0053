The grocery retailer, based in Oakland, Calif., didn't disclose terms; but Majestic, in a separate news release, said it paid &quot;over $100 million&quot; for the discount liquor chain. Liquor Barn had 1986 sales of about $332 million. Majestic said it had sales last year of $20 million. Safeway last year agreed to go private through a $4.2 billion leveraged buyout.
