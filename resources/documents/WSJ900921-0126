On Wednesday, the agency offered up the winners of itsfirst work-force quality awards. Not surprisingly, one of thecommon threads is training.</LP><TEXT>   The awards -- called LIFT America (an acronym of LaborInvesting for Tomorrow) -- are given to employers, unions,educational organizations and communities to recognize&quot;creative solutions&quot; for upgrading the quality of the workforce. Sixteen winners were chosen from 500 nominees; theyrun the gamut from local vocational programs to industrialgiants.   Vermont Heating andamp; Ventilating Co. was cited for itsembrace of programs to enhance skills and motivate workers.John Stearns, head of personnel training, says the250-employee company in Colchester, Vt., spends 10% of grossrevenue on training and education programs. Elaine Druke, whorose from a journeyman sheetmetal worker to vice president,administration, credits much of her success to the company'smotivational efforts. &quot;Without the educational help,&quot; shesays, &quot;it wouldn't have happened.&quot;   International Business Machines Corp. was honored for itsemployee &quot;work/life&quot; programs. The IBM programs, addressingfamily-related needs, include assisting employees with childcare and elder care, spouse relocation, schedule flexibilityand leaves of absence, and a broad array of seminars,educational and career assistance for retirees. The companyalso has committed $25 million to increase the supply andquality of child-care and elder-care services in areas whereemployees work and live.   Though the IBM programs involve both women and men, theypartly reflect IBM projections that over the 35-year periodending in 2000 its male employee population will have droppedby 25% while the number of its women employees will havetripled.   Several other award winners also stress efforts to improveopportunities for women and minorities. Building Futures inIndustry and Trades, a program run by Portland CommunityCollege in Oregon, is a &quot;fast track&quot; six-month trainingcourse designed to put women on paths for such nontraditionalskilled careers as electricians, plumbers, carpenters andsheet-metal workers in jobs that pay $15 to $25 an hour.   Previously, women weren't striving toward such jobs,program officials say. Many of the women students, whoseaverage age is 36, were working in low-paid jobs -- such asin fast-food restaurants -- when they entered the program.About 35% were unemployed and on welfare; 70% were singleheads of household.   The program fills women's &quot;skill gaps&quot; through immersioncourses in everything from learning how to wire electricalprojects to a physical-fitness program to career planning.The women build a house from the foundation up, do upper-bodytraining, and even hear from sex-discrimination attorneys onhow to file a complaint if a problem arises. Since the summerof 1989, when the program started, 106 women have completedtraining -- an 87% graduation rate. Of the graduates, 90%went on to apprenticeship or on-the-job training positions.   Katharine Settle says she entered the program because &quot;myhusband had just recently left after 34 years of marriage,and I found myself thinking about what I was going to do fora living.&quot; Though she hadn't had a job in 26 years, shethought the training program would help her acquire skills tobe a residential-construction contractor and thus make use ofexperience already gained while helping to build and renovatehouses with her former husband. She's now pursuing anassociate degree in building-construction technology and saysthe training program was &quot;invaluable&quot; in helping her reachher goals.   The Labor Department also selected a program created bythe National Urban Coalition and funded by Shell Oil Co.,part of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, to better equip minorityand women students with math, science and technology skills.The program, begun in 1987 at nine elementary schools inHouston and Washington, D.C., has expanded to 30 schoolsaround the country. Specially trained teachers use newtechniques to teach skills, and students are also required tospend Saturday mornings at school or on field trips with aparent or family member for family learning sessions. Theteachers link science skills to the children's own heritage,and use special role models to motivate students, includingminority astronauts, entertainers and athletes. Follow-upsshow the program made positive differences in test scores,attendance and motivation levels of participating children.   &quot;Most companies are beginning to realize the changingdemographics of the work force and the fact that the schoolsare in a crisis,&quot; says Paula Saizan, Shell's coordinator forthe program, which is called &quot;Say YES to a Youngster'sFuture.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
