 Do youhate dragging around a big, clunky hard drive?andP;  Is your traveling floppy-diskcollection getting damaged and lost?andP;  Or do you simply need a way to lock upconfidential data when you're not around?andM;If you answer yes to any of these questions, then you probably need amagnetic-disk-cartridge drive.andP;  That's the easy part.andP;  You have three typesof internal mechanisms to choose from: Bernoulli flexible-disk-cartridgesystems manufactured by Iomega and two different hard-disk-cartridge systemsmanufactured by SyQuest and Ricoh.andM;Which is best for you?andP;  Storage capacity isn't a major factor: All threesystems provide 40 to 50 megabytes of removable, transportable storage percartridge.andP;  To complicate matters further, 30 vendors couple these systemswith power supplies, put them into cases with the necessary SCSI connectorsand switches, add software, and sell them under a variety of brand names.andO;Each system is intended to be (knock on wood) compatible with all drives thatuse the same manufacturer's cartridges -- any SyQuest cartridge should workin any SyQuest-based drive, for example; however, a SyQuest cartridge willnot fit a Bernoulli- or Ricoh-based drive, and vice versa.andM;All three approaches fit a limited budget and can satisfy your expanding needfor disk storage.andP;  The three cartridge types are lightweight and compact, andall make moving large amounts of information from one place to another lesscumbersome and less expensive.andM;So which should you choose?andP;  Whose advertising claims should you believe?andP;  Orshould you pick a different storage technology entirely (see the &quot;OtherRemovable Media&quot; sidebar)?andP;  Come with MacUser Labs as we explore the hiddendifferences among magnetic-disk-cartridge drives.andM;Round, Removable, and MagneticandM;Of the 30 drives we tested that use one of the three magnetic-disk-cartridgesystems, 2 -- the Iomega Transportable 44 and the Ocean MicrosystemsTotemIV44MB--use Iomega's Bernoulli system.andP;  Twenty-four -- from the AlliancePeripheral Systems 45 MB Removable through the Total Peripherals TP-44R --use the popular and time-tested SyQuest hard-disk-cartridge system.andP;  Theremaining 4 -- the Corel Systems 50 MB Removable, Microtech InternationalR50, Sumo Systems SSER 50 Removable, and Univation Q50 -- use the newhard-disk-cartridge system from Ricoh.andM;The Bernoulli system, introduced to the Macintosh market in 1985 and refinedduring following years, was one of the first widely distributed systems touse high-capacity flexible-disk cartridges.andP;  The Bernoulli cartridge lookspretty much like a standard Mac floppy disk, scaled up to contain its5.25-inch-diameter medium.andM;As a Bernoulli disk spins, first centrifugal force and then changes in airpressure lift the surface of the plastic disk close to the drive's magneticread/write head.andP;  Unlike with fixed hard disks, removable hard-diskcartridges, or conventional high-capacity floppy disks (such as&quot;megafloppies&quot; from Kodak/Verbatim and Data Technology), a carefullycontrolled aerodynamic effect makes the Bernoulli-disk surface virtuallyimmune to read/write-head crashes (see the &quot;How It Works&quot; sidebar).andM;The Bernoulli effect, named after Swiss physicist Daniel Bernoulli(1700-1782), is observed when the velocity of a fluid, such as air, increasesover a surface and the pressure on that surface then decreases.andP;  (If you haveany doubt that the Bernoulli effect can be safely controlled in practice, youshould avoid flying in airplanes.)andM;Even when the Bernoulli drive is turned off, contact between the read/writehead and the disk is next to impossible.andP;  Nevertheless, although Bernoullidrives have evolved over the years, they still tend to be heavier, slower,and louder than hard-disk-cartridge drives.andM;SyQuest hard-disk-cartridge drives for IBM-compatible PCs appeared in 1983but took five more years to make it to the Mac.andP;  The outside appearance ofSyQuest hard-disk cartridges suggests thicker, rather simplified versions oftheir Bernoulli counterparts.andP;  On the inside, however, the two cartridgesystems are completely different.andP;  The SyQuest medium is a hard, magneticallycoated metal platter, somewhat thicker than that used in any fixed-hard-diskdrive.andP;  In operation, both the SyQuest and the Ricoh mechanisms andcartridges are very similar to a conventional hard drive--except that thecartridges can be removed, leaving behind the read/write heads and all otherdrive components.andM;Although the new Ricoh drives outwardly resemble the established SyQuestdrives, we found noticeable advantages in Ricoh's cartridge design: moredurable construction, better dust protection, and more sophisticated safetyfeatures in operation (see the &quot;How It Works&quot; sidebar).andP;  Even so, it may betoo soon for Ricoh to boast, without unbiased proof, that its drives aresignificantly more reliable; Ricoh cartridges aren't common enough andhaven't yet accumulated enough dusty, real-world mileage to support such aclaim.andM;At press time, SyQuest and Microtech International (formerly a major SyQuestvendor and now the largest distributor of Ricoh-cartridge drives) wereengaged in well-publicized lawsuits, with Microtech claiming high failurerates for the SyQuest drives and SyQuest charging Microtech with violationsof contractual arrangements.andM;Initially Microtech submitted a SyQuest-based drive for our tests butsubsequently withdrew it, leaving just its Ricoh drive.andP;  (The company hasinstituted a 24-hour service-and-repair program for all SyQuest drives stillcovered under its five-year warranty.)andP;  In this friendly atmosphere (and withother new Ricoh distributors such as GCC technologies casting doubt onSyQuest-drive reliability), MacUser Labs began testing the latest Ricoh,SyQuest, and Bernoulli drives.andM;What Makes a Good Drive?andM;Because every removable drive starts out as a standard mechanism from theOEM, many consumers believe that the final products are virtually identical.andO;But by the time each distributor has decided on a power supply, internalframework, SCSI connectors, formatting and driver software, and so on, thefinished drives' reliability, features, and performance can be verydifferent.andM;The first indications of a good magnetic-disk-cartridge drive are asubstantial power supply that has UL (Underwriters' Laboratories) approval; aquiet fan; a metal case; and easy-to-use, all-purpose formatting software andutilities.andP;  Other important features include shielded SCSI connectors(preferably standard 50-pin) and external SCSI termination; good technicalsupport from the distributor or an authorized service center plus a longwarranty; and a well-written and up-to-date manual.andP;  Finally, smart users --to protect against careless product engineering -- come in handy.andM;An example of how easily product engineers can ignore average Mac users'normal work habits: The cases on some cartridge drives are flexible enoughthat if you put something even moderately heavy (such as a Mac SE) on top ofthe drive, the case can distort enough to obstruct the fan, or generate arattling noise, or even damage the delicate electronics.andP;  Squeeze eachcandidate before you buy.andM;Oddly enough, there doesn't seem to be a direct correlation between amagnetic-disk-cartridge drive's quality and its cost.andP;  The FWB and PLI drivesare well built and have high list prices, whereas other drives offering goodcomponent quality -- such as the MacProducts USA Magic 45 and the Ehman 45 MBRemovable -- are much more reasonably priced.andM;According to SyQuest, cheappower supplies emit radio-frequency noise that caninterfere with data throughput in the drive's controller board.andP;  Because thisphenomenon is almost impossible for users to test in advance, the onlyprotection is the longest possible warranty from a reputable vendor.andP;  Thisisn't a problem for drives with a well-designed, shielded internal metalframe (which keeps radio-frequency noise from interfering with datathroughput).andP;  Our examination of the drives for this report uncovered a broadrange of shielding quality: Among the drives with the best shielding was theexcellent MicroNet MR45.andM;But shielding of this sort can also have a negative side -- if it isn'tpositioned correctly.andP;  Poorly placed electromagnetic shielding can block airflow to the controller board, causing rapid heat buildup.andP;  Overtime, hightemperature can cause electronic components to fail prematurely; the warmer adrive, the sooner its demise.andM;One easy way to tell if a drive is too hot is to feel a cartridge after a fewhours' use; if the cartridge is truly hot (not just warm) to the touch, thedrive mechanism may fail earlier than that of a similar drive with betterventilation.andP;  Heat buildup can be a real problem with SyQuest drives.andM;On the other hand, be forewarned that some cheap disk-cartridge drives comewith fans loud enough to frighten off nearby trucks.andP;  We found nounreasonably loud fans among the drives we tested, but hardware specs arealways changing; any drive that's still under warranty and develops anannoying whine, buzz, or rattle should go back to the dealer.andM;Growing PainsandM;When SyQuest drives first became available for the Mac, they had majorproblems with power-supply failure (which wasn't actually part of the SyQuestmechanism) and with cartridges jamming in the drive.andP;  If you didn't ejectcartridges carefully, you could rip the delicate read/write head right out ofthe drive.andM;If a cartridge ever jams in an older SyQuest drive, here's the recommendedsolution: Push hard against the top center edge of the cartridge whilesimultaneously pushing the eject lever.andP;  This will usually release a jammedcartridge; the only other option is to have your dealer disassemble thedrive.andP;  SyQuest claims that cartridge jams should not be a problem with thenewer (revision 7 or later) drives; if a jam occurs in one of these newdrives, get the drive replaced.andM;Unfortunately, it is still possible to stick a SyQuest cartridge backwardinto its drive -- don't laugh, we can all make mistakes when we're in ahurry.andP;  If done with enough force, this can definitely damage the drive.andO;According to SyQuest, user education is the only immediate solution to thisproblem (until vendors come up with a hardware fix).andM;Bernoulli technology still has a few problems that have lingered from itsfirst days in the Mac market.andP;  Most important, the flexible medium in thecartridges can and does wear out, depending on how much the disk is keptspinning in the drive (and therefore flexing under the read/write head).andO;Bernoulli drives also need regular internal cleaning (special kits areprovided for this purpose), or read/write errors can occur.andP;  The cartridgesdo come with a five-year warranty, however -- as opposed to the far morecommon one-year warranty for SyQuest and Ricoh cartridges.andP;  Iomega'sexcellent Workshop software (see Figure 1) minimizes and keeps track of mediawear.andP;  And Bernoulli distributors typically are very fast about replacing afailed cartridge; a replacement is often shipped (via overnight air freight)within hours of your phone call.andM;Let us add a final warning: If you need removable media that will frequentlyspin for hours and even days at a time, stick with hard-disk cartridges orhard-disk subsystems (or consider erasable optical drives).andP;  Bernoulli drivesare best used for reliable data transport, storage, and backup.andM;New Kid on the BlockandM;Ricoh drives haven't been out long enough for us to judge how much theiroperation has benefited from SyQuest's long history.andP;  It's clear, though,that Ricoh learned from a common cause of SyQuest-drive failures: damage tothe read/write heads when cartridges were ejected while the disks were stillspinning.andP;  Ricoh drives simply cannot eject unless the disk has stoppedspinning and the read/write head is out of the way.andP;  Still, unlike Bernoullidrives (which eject a cartridge only if its icon is dragged into the desktopTrash and the drive spins down), Ricoh drives can eject cartridges even whenthe drive's power is turned off.andP;  In emergencies, of course, a special tool(resembling the familiar straightened paper clip) can force a Bernoullicartridge to eject.andM;Ricoh mechanisms may take a longer time to spin up than do SyQuest or otherdrives, so trying to use a Ricoh drive as your startup device takes carefulplanning if other SCSI devices are linked to your Mac.andP;  Even with all SCSI-IDnumbers correctly set, you have to turn on the Ricoh mechanism severalseconds before you turn on your other SCSI devices, so that the Ricoh diskwill be spinning at full speed when the Macintosh checks the SCSI chain foravailable startup drives.andP;  Both GCC Technologies (see the &quot;Late Arrivals&quot;sidebar) and Microtech have software solutions to this complication.andM;Another problem recalls the compatibility hassles that SyQuest drivessuffered soon after their introduction.andP;  At times it's difficult to get the(Ricoh-based) Microtech and Univation drives to function with other SCSIhard-disk drives.andP;  Even when all drives are properly terminated, sometimesthe sequence of SCSI devices in the cable chain must be switched to geteverything working without system crashes.andP;  But don't rush to blame Microtechand Univation -- the SCSI interface is notoriously fickle (see &quot;A Beginner'sGuide to Daisy Chains,&quot; August '90, page 243, and &quot;SCSI Solutions,&quot; December'89, page 229).andP;  Prospective buyers of Ricoh drives may need more than basicawareness of SCSI IDs, cables, and terminators, however.andM;Revisionist HardwareandM;There have been three generations of SyQuest drives over the past two years.andO;The first two generations were fine; the drives performed adequately, butthey left lots of room for improvement.andP;  The third generation tried to reducedisk-access times and to correct a few design flaws (such as the drives'willingness to eject cartridges while the disk was still spinning).andO;Revisions 1 and 2 of these third-generation drives were marginally fasterthan the previous generations.andP;  Revisions 3, 4, and 5 were even faster,boasting access times in the low 20-millisecond range -- respectable even fora fixed hard disk.andP;  However, these revisions also introduced majorincompatibilities with various printers and scanners and even with someformatting software.andM;Until January 1990, SyQuest shipped thousands of these revision 3-through-5drives before discovering how serious the problems were -- serious enough toprompt a recall order to its various distributors.andP;  Unfortunately, thecompanies selling SyQuest drives had no legal obligation to inform users whohad already purchased the problem drives.andP;  This became especially nasty, inthat the only way to find a drive's revision number was to open the case andcheck the serial number, an intrusion that would invalidate the warranty!andM;There's now a freeware program called SCSI Probe (the latest version isavailable in MacUser's Zmac Download Library Forum on CompuServe) that canhelp you easily determine revision numbers without jeopardizing yourwarranty.andP;  SCSI Probe is a cdev that gives basic information about each ofthe SCSI devices connected to your Mac and displays the version number as athree-letter code.andM;If the version number of your drive contains the characters F5E, then thedrive is part of the problematic revisions 3 and 4.andP;  Finding out if you havea revision-5 drive is more difficult, because it has the same three-lettercode as revisions 6 through 10 -- which don't have the compatibilityproblems.andP;  SyQuest states, however, that revision 5 drives were the last onessold with an orange disk-activity indicator light.andP;  Unfortunately, SyQuestcannot promise that it will never use an orange light in future drives.andP;  Ifyou do have an older SyQuest drive with an orange indicator light, theversion code to worry about is F2G.andM;If you discover you have a faulty drive, return it directly to the company ordealer that sold you the drive and ask it to confirm the revision 5designation.andP;  If this presents problems (or if the drive is no longer underwarranty), then SyQuest suggests that you call its technical-support staff.andO;The company's stated policy is to remove all remaining unsold defective olderdrives from the market.andP;  Any faulty drive already in use will qualify for afree upgrade if it's still under warranty (upgrades to out-of-warranty drivesrequire a service charge).andP;  If you're shopping for a SyQuest drive, beforewarned that our quick survey of local computer stores discovered severalrevision 4 and 5 SyQuest mechanisms waiting for their first owners.andM;Further problems may arise if you use more than one brand of SyQuest drive.andO;Not all the formatting software sold with these drives is compatible withother formatters.andP;  This is the result of Apple's having left the choice ofSCSI-disk-driver software to third-party vendors.andP;  Because each formatter mayhave a slightly different driver, some drives may have problems withcartridges formatted by another company's software.andP;  These problems rangefrom the inability to mount cartridges to corrupting the data on cartridgeswhen they are inserted.andM;Although the companies selling these different drives probably wouldn'tactively market this approach, it is a good idea for people who use multiplebrands of SyQuest drives to standardize on a single formatter.andP;  This is thebest way to ensure that each of the drives can read any of the cartridgeswithout problems.andM;If you must use a cartridge that was formatted with different software, youmay want to temporarily remove from the System Folder any INITs (drivers)that you own cartridges normally require; then restart your computer beforeattempting to mount the nonstandard cartridge on the desktop.andP;  This approachguarantees that the drivers from your regular formatter will not be alreadyloaded into the Mac's RAM and that the nonstandard cartridge will mount whileusing its own drivers (which normally reside on the cartridge disk, unless italso requires a special INIT).andP;  If you do all this, remember to replace anyINITs and restart again before mounting one of your own cartridges.andP;  If youanticipate dealing with such situations frequently, we suggest that youinvest in La Cie's Silverlining software (FWB's equally good formatter maysoon be available separately from its drives).andM;Seek Time Versus the Real WorldandM;MacUser Labs performed numerous tests intended to determine the overallperformance of each of the 30 magnetic-disk-cartridge drives.andP;  We designedthe tests to compare differences in average seek time, throughput, and speedin general use.andP;  We used the excellent shareware utility SCSI Evaluator(available on Zmac) to test raw speed (seek time and throughput), and we usedMacUser Labs' own DiskBasher! program to time a series of reads and writesthat approximates the way an application accesses a disk during general use.andO;Finally, to further simulate real-world use, we duplicated a 10-megabytefolder containing several folders holding files of various sizes in theFinder.andP;  All these tests together revealed moderate performance differencesamong the drives.andM;A drive's seek time (measured in milliseconds) is the average time requiredfor the read/write heads to move between any two tracks on the disk'srecording surface.andP;  In theory, the lower the average seek time, the fasterthe drive.andP;  Unfortunately, seek time by itself doesn't always reveal how fasta drive really works for you.andP;  To get a clear sense of the drive's actualspeed, you must take into account its throughput -- the rate at whichinformation is read from the disk and passed through the SCSI port from yourdrive to your Mac.andP;  Different drives with the same seek times can showremarkable differences in throughput (see Figure 2).andM;Each Mac model also has its own maximum throughput, which limits the rate atwhich it can accept information through its SCSI port.andP;  Apple's theoreticalrates range from 263K per second (on a Mac Plus) to 2.1 megabytes per second(on a Mac IIci and IIsi).andP;  Theoretically, if you want a drive that's trulyfast, get one that has a throughput rate that can keep up with your Mac.andO;Unfortunately, none of the drives we tested came close to challenging themaximum throughput of even a Mac SE.andM;No real knockout winner emerged in the performance categories, and we sawonly a few true losers.andP;  For the most part, there wasn't much variation: Thebest drives weren't much faster than those in the midrange.andP;  The FWBHammerDisk44 (a SyQuest mechanism) was the overall fastest, followed closelyby the MacProducts USA Magic 45, the Rodime Systems R45 Plus, and the PLIInfinity 40 Turbo.andP;  All four of the Ricoh drives (from Microtech, Sumo,Univation, and Corel) and both Bernoullis (from Iomega and Ocean) fell intothe bottom third for every test except the small-file-duplication test.andP;  Infact, in this test the Bernoulli drive from Iomega did as well as mostSyQuest drives, because of the excellent Bernoulli data-caching scheme.andM;Software Makes a DifferenceandM;Formatting software (and the method used to install and control devicedrivers that mount the cartridge) is one of the most important and yetvariable aspects of cartridge-drive systems.andP;  Some of the software takes aminimalist approach, whereas other programs are quite elegant and have morefeatures than average users will ever need.andP;  In addition to simply formattingcartridges, all the formatting software we examined can test disks to find,lock out, and replace weak sectors.andP;  These basic functions are about the onlythings that the different formatters have in common.andM;One of the main differences among the various formatters is the userinterface.andP;  MicroNet Utilities from MicroNet has the best interface.andP;  FWB'sformatter is also easy to use, complete, and powerful.andP;  La Cie's Silverliningisn't as straightforward, but it's powerful and offers a variety of usefulformatting options.andP;  Relax's formatting software, although powerful, isparticularly difficult to use, and its testing software is an applicationseparate from the formatting software -- an unnecessary and annoyingdivision.andM;Some formatters have extra features such as the ability to create partitions(which appear as separate volumes on the desktop) or to defragment disks(improving performance by collecting scattered portions of each file into aminimum number of contiguous data tracks).andP;  Iomega's software can format acartridge in the background within MultiFinder -- a handy feature,considering that this process can take up to 30 minutes.andM;Many of the drives we tested came with nothing more than basic formattingsoftware.andP;  Even backup programs were bundled with only about half of thedrives.andP;  If buyers of these low-cost drives already have comprehensive backupand utility software, then such drives offer an economical system for bulkdata storage.andP;  However, we suggest shopping for a good drive that ships witha complete repertoire of disk-management utilities.andP;  The PLI, Microtech, andLa Cie drives all come with excellent formatting software, useful utilitiessuch as Norton Utilities for the Macintosh or SUM II, and some great programs(Microtech's in particular) designed to automate the time-consuming chore ofdata backup.andP;  The Mirror Technologies drives include goodies such as CESoftware's QuicKeys Lite (a simple macro program), MockPackage Plus, andDiskTop 3.0.andM;The People's ChoiceandM;Good software is only one of several criteria you should weigh before youdecide which cartridge drive to buy.andP;  The first consideration will be yourintended use for the drive (see the &quot;Bottom Line&quot; sidebar).andP;  The moredifficult questions involve component quality -- power supplies, casematerial (metal or plastic), ventilation design, and so on.andP;  Under theirseemingly identical outer cases, all magnetic-disk-cartridge drives aredefinitely not equal (even if their raw speed and throughput are nearlymatched).andP;  And don't discount the value of an old-fashioned popularitycontest, especially when compatibility among mechanisms is important to you.andO;If a large number of your experienced Mac-owning friends can personally vouchfor a product's reliability and you need to share data with them, it mightnot be a bad idea to join their club -- as long as MacUser Labs agrees withtheir choice.andM;Steve Costa is the technical-support coordinator for BMUG (Berkeley MacintoshUsers Group).andO;</TEXT></DOC>
