Leo Conti seems one of corporateAmerica's unlikeliest foes. Yet, the 67-year-old Catholicpriest is crusading against high executive pay, or as he putsit, legalized &quot;corporate theft.&quot;   Specifically, Father Conti is taking aim at Raymond Smith,chairman of Bell Atlantic Corp., whose compensation totaled$2.4 million in 1990. The priest, who makes $7,200 a year,has 76 shares of Bell Atlantic inherited from his mother, andhas been trying for years to force a shareholder vote on the$4.2 million bonus pool reserved for the company's 45 topexecutives.</LP><TEXT>   Until today, Father Conti's efforts have been ignored. Hisproposals, crudely typed on a manual typewriter andaccompanied by handwritten cover letters, have routinely beenpassed over by the company, with the blessing of theSecurities and Exchange Commission.   But today, the SEC is switching sides. Responding to thepublic furor over high executive pay, the agency is expectedto mail out letters to 10 major American companies, includingBell Atlantic, prohibiting them from excluding proposals likeFather Conti's from their proxy ballots. The action willreverse the agency's decades-old policy of not allowingexecutive pay proposals to be put to shareholder vote. Thechange could turn figures traditionally on the fringe of thefinancial world, such as Father Conti, into a major nuisancefor the corporate elite. The new ruling could also triggerproposals from more influential institutional holders.   At Baltimore Gas andamp; Electric shareholders will be asked toapprove a non-binding resolution to cap top officers' pay at20 times that of the average worker. At Grumman Corp.,stockholders will vote on a proposal to jettison themanagement bonus plan until the stock price regains its 1986level of about $27 a share. And at Chrysler Corp., the SECwill allow shareholders to consider a measure that wouldlimit the value of executive stock options. Executives at anumber of other major U.S. companies will face similarunaccustomed scrutiny of their pay envelopes.   The SEC's decision is its third action on executive pay inthe past year, and by far its most significant. Underpressure from shareholders and Congress, and realizing thatit was blocking stockholders from freely speaking todirectors about executive pay, the agency decided to forcemanagements to take the heat. In its previous actions, theSEC has taken steps to allow shareholders to change companybylaws affecting executive pay and has announced plans toforce companies to value stock options in a uniform way.   A director's &quot;job is not to play Santa Claus and setwhatever compensation management asks for, nor is it torubber-stamp whatever shareholders say,&quot; says SEC ChairmanRichard Breeden. &quot;We hope this will result in the board beingbetter informed on shareholder views and doing a better jobin setting pay.&quot;   To be sure, the odds against shareholder proposals made bythe likes of Father Conti are long. Big institutionalstockholders rarely vote against management on proxy issues.Moreover, by law, even if the proposals are approved, theywill be non-binding.   But the SEC's action is nevertheless sure to increasepressure on directors to hold the line on executivecompensation. With the political climate turning against highexecutive pay, there is even some speculation that laws willbe changed to give resolutions like Father Conti's moreteeth.   The new SEC policy, which takes effect immediately,permits shareholders to vote on proposals that target topmanagement compensation only -- not on broader proposals thatdeal with all company managers. Indeed, several of theproposals tentatively approved by the SEC, including thosetargeting Grumman and Chrysler, will be allowed only if theproponent inserts words to make clear the measures apply tothe top tier. While the SEC has approved just the 10shareholder proposals so far, the policy change effectivelyopens the door to similar proposals by shareholders of anypublic company. Those additional proposals would also besubject to SEC approval.   Under current rules any shareholder with at least $1,000of a company's stock, or 1% of the total shares, and who hasheld them for at least a year, can file a proposal forinclusion in the proxy. The proposals approved by the SECtoday all come from individual shareholders, rather than biginstitutional players. Many are handwritten or awkwardlytyped. The little shareholder, says Mr. Breeden, isincreasingly concerned about this issue, and that's a bigreason why the SEC has changed its policy.   Hardware-store owner Emil Rossi calls his provision torestrict Chrysler's stock options a question ofaccountability. &quot;I own a little family-owned store and if wedon't make it, I'm accountable,&quot; says the 67-year-old Mr.Rossi. &quot;We think you should be able to put anything on aproposal, and if 51% of the shareholders vote for it, so beit.&quot;   His plan would block Chrysler from changing terms ofexecutives' stock options when the stock price fails to rise,as happened last year. Chairman Lee Iacocca &quot;took the bigbenefit a few years ago when the company was doing well, andnow he's still taking the big benefit when the company isdoing terrible,&quot; Mr. Rossi contends. Chrysler declines tocomment. For 1990, the last year for which figures areavailable, Mr. Iacocca earned $4.6 million in wages,incentives and other compensation.   Even before a single shareholder vote has been cast onexecutive compensation, changes are starting to occur in theway American corporations treat their shareholders, pay theirexecutives and handle relations between directors andmanagement. Executives &quot;are looking at their compensationnow, because they don't want to be embarrassed later,&quot; saysPeg O'Hara of the Investor Responsibility Research Center,which does research for big stockholders.   Many companies are showing a new concern for the views ofthe pension funds, mutual funds and other institutions thatown the bulk of corporate America. Several, including ITTCorp. and United Airlines parent UAL Corp., have negotiatedwith major holders to revamp the way they pay management orat least explain that pay. Others are seeking to defuseshareholder concern by tying pay more closely to performance.   The proxy changes could help speed a significant thoughstill-subtle trend in corporate America. Major shareholders,who traditionally have been passive, are increasingly findingthat they like being listened to by top management, and maystart pursuing a hands-on role in additional aspects ofcorporate activity. Moreover, the ability of shareholders tovote against directors on the compensation committee whoignore their views could alter the cozy relationships betweenchief executives who nominate directors and the directors whoin turn set the CEO's pay, predicts Stanford law professorJoseph Grundfest, a former SEC commissioner. &quot;The bottom lineis that the board of directors has got to take a much morearm's length view of the CEO,&quot; he argues.   That's exactly what Father Conti and hundreds of otherindividual shareholders across the country have been arguingfor years. And for years, they have seen the SEC shut themdown and shield corporate executives from potentiallyembarrassing votes. Under the securities laws, companies canpetition the SEC to allow them to exclude proposals fromtheir proxy ballots. This year, each of the 10 companies nowfacing shareholder proposals on executive pay argued that thematters should be excluded. In comment for this article,several said the proposals crimped the flexibility ofmanagement and usurped the responsibilities of companydirectors.   Traditionally, the SEC has agreed that managers' pay ispart of the &quot;ordinary business&quot; of a company to be decided bydirectors. After all, the agency has reasoned, shareholdersshouldn't be allowed to set assembly-line workers' pay -- sowhy let them set executive compensation?   Back in Evansville, a Midwestern manufacturing anduniversity town, Father Conti laughs at the SEC's oldinterpretation of &quot;ordinary business.&quot; &quot;I'm not a financieror anything, but it seems to me that doubling a man's salaryis more than day-to-day business,&quot; he says. He says hiscampaign has also involved lobbying the SEC to change itsmind.   It would be hard to find someone whose life style differsmore from the typical corporate chief executive's. Themonsignor lives on the east side of town in a smallground-floor apartment that is a jumble of rumpled clothes,medicine bottles, papers and open books. The white walls areunadorned. A stack of videocassettes on religious topics isbroken only by the Marx Brothers' &quot;Night at the Opera,&quot;though Father Conti owns no VCR.   Pushing aside two uncovered pillows from a 20-year-oldcouch, he jokes: &quot;It's the cleaning lady's day off.&quot;   A native of Providence, R.I., and the only child of a pairof pharmacists, eight-year-old Leo Conti shocked a familydinner nearly 60 years ago by announcing his plan to devotehis life to religion. But later that night, his father toldhim, &quot;Whatever you pick, give it all you've got.&quot;   When his mother died in 1981, she left stocks and bonds toher only child. He knew a bit about the market, and what heknew didn't comfort him: At Providence College in themid-1940s, he wrote a paper on the stock-market crash of1929.   So he quickly unloaded virtually all his new holdings,hanging on only to 19 American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.shares. When ATandamp;T was broken up in 1984, they became BellAtlantic shares. Two stock splits later, he owns 76 of BellAtlantic's 395 million shares outstanding, or less than0.00002%. Notably, though the stock price has sagged inrecent years, the value of those shares has increased morethan 250% since they were issued in 1984, if reinvesteddividends are included.   Since becoming chairman 2 1/2 years ago, Mr. Smith has wonpraise for turning Bell Atlantic into one of the mostaggressive &quot;Baby Bells&quot; through his use of new technology andacquisitions, including his latest plan to buy a cellularphone company for $2.5 billion. Analysts commend Mr. Smith onhis push into new services, cost reduction, and drive to makethe company a more efficient operation. Still, the companylast year had operating profit of $1.33 billion, down 3% from1990.   In 1990, Mr. Smith's salary was $628,600. His short-termbonus was almost as large, and his stock options andperformance grants brought the total to $2.4 million. (BellAtlantic doesn't quarrel with the accounting but won'tconfirm the numbers.) The company's stock price, meanwhile,dropped 3.6% in 1990 and another 10% in 1991.   Father Conti's proposal would eliminate Mr. Smith's bonus,as well as bonuses for other top managers, and return themoney to customers in Bell Atlantic's service area ofmid-Atlantic states. Mr. Smith wasn't available for commentfor this article but, at the moment, other Bell Atlanticexecutives say they don't feel threatened by the Conti plan.Separate from anything the priest or the SEC is doing, theysay, the company two weeks ago froze top management'ssalaries and increased the bonus pay for lower-levelmanagers. And, they note, the company's 1.1 millionshareholders had a chance last year to express their viewswhen they voted on a proposal to start paying seniormanagers' bonuses partly in stock. In the past, bonuses werepaid all in cash. The proposal passed with 90% of the vote.   Moreover, Bell Atlantic executives argue that pay levelsare right where they ought to be to provide incentives formanagement. &quot;If you want to attract and retain good people,you have to pay them properly,&quot; says Graham Ragland,assistant vice president for compensation and benefits. &quot;Wehave nothing to hide, so there's no reason for us to beoverly sensitive to outside pressure.&quot;   Indeed, analysts and independent observers say thecompany's pay levels are on a par with competitors'. &quot;Giventhe size of his company and what the rest of the industrypays, it's not excessive,&quot; says Robert Morris, an analyst atGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co. in San Francisco.   Robert Pozen, general counsel at Fidelity Investmentsmutual-fund group, a Bell Atlantic shareholder, says thatwhile he hasn't studied the Bell Atlantic question, the Contiplan is the kind of proposal he would oppose. &quot;We like tokeep base salary as low as possible and have significant paybased on performance of the company,&quot; he says. Eliminatingbonuses would run directly counter to that.   Father Conti, who has never attended a Bell Atlanticannual meeting, knows he has an uphill battle. He expectsinstitutional holders, with 42% of the stock, to vote againsthim. Individuals, he hopes, will support his measure.   In the end, Father Conti insists, his idea forcompensation is simple, if a bit unorthodox for capitalismand corporate America. Quoting a 100-year-old encyclical ofPope Leo XIII, which established the Catholic policy oncompensation, he says the worker should have enough income to&quot;provide for himself and his family sufficient to live a lifein keeping with their Christian dignity.&quot; That's a code,Father Conti argues, that management should live by, too.   ---                       Attack On Pay                                                                                                          The SEC is telling the following companies to allownon-binding shareholder votes on pay proposals.
