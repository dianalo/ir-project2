PerryStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Political discourse in Britain has narrowed almost obsessively to a single question: When will Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher call a general election?    The answer: soon. How soon? Maybe, according to one script, June; maybe, according to another, October.    It depends in large degree on local elections in England and Wales on May 7. If Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party does well, especially in places where it holds marginal parliamentary seats, and the public-opinion polls respond favorably, the general election will be in June.    But what if May 7 turns out to be another day of triumph for the resurgent Alliance of the Social Democratic and Liberal parties? That's a strong possibility, and would point to an October election (when voters would have forgotten what happened in May).    Tory strategists don't worry much anymore about Neil Kinnock's Labor Party, thanks largely to Labor's self-inflicted wounds over its non-nuclear defense policy, the antics of many of its &quot;loony left&quot; councillors in inner London and a growing suspicion that Mr. Kinnock simply isn't up to the job. Norman Tebbit, the Tory Party chairman, says Mr. Kinnock &quot;has done very well by himself to defeat Labor.&quot; Labor, pundits agree, is in deep trouble.    The wild card, then, is the Alliance, Britain's six-year-old third party.    The past few days, the Tories have brought up their big guns and laid down a noisy, but perhaps not always accurate, anti-Alliance barrage.    &quot;We are delighted by all the attention,&quot; says Richard Newby, national secretary of the Social Democrats. &quot;It is an unalloyed pleasure.&quot; Adds Alan Beith, the Liberals' deputy leader, &quot;The Tories clearly are reassessing where the real threat is. They have decided Labor can't win. Now it's between the Tories and us.&quot;    That may be a premature assessment. No one expects the Alliance to win this election outright. What might happen is a hung Parliament, with no one in clear control. The Alliance, in that situation, could wheel and deal with both Labor and the Conservatives. The Tories figure they must do something to cut the Alliance down to size before it's too late, and attaching the socialist label to the new party seems to be one way to do it.    The Tories' dilemma is while they're No. 1 in the opinion polls, the lead isn't quite enough, even with their tax-cutting, election-year budget, revealed with the usual pyrotechnics March 17. Two recent polls put them ahead at 39%. (One of their own polls reportedly shows the Alliance nudging out Labor for second place.)    That's enough to win a majority of 10 or 15 seats, almost too close for comfort. Their majority now is 136. They need a few more percentage points in the polls to feel confident about calling an election.    But the Alliance, with back-to-back by-election triumphs, is surging. For both Labor and the Tories, that's ominous. If the Alliance displaces Labor as No. 2, the bedrock on which British politics rests would shift.    The Tories figure they hadn't any alternative to singling out the Alliance for attack, but in doing so they are tending to legitimatize a new party they had tried to ignore -- giving it national publicity it normally begs for.    Mr. Tebbit, the angriest Tory leader, put on an anti-Alliance show at party headquarters this week, complete with posters, slides and TV images, in a preview of his party's shift in tactics. The message: The Alliance is a socialist party prepared to cut a deal with Mr. Kinnock that would give the nation another round of ruinous Marxist policy.    Mrs. Thatcher, at a meeting of party activists in Torquay, sounded the same theme. She charged that the Alliance is &quot;the Labor Party in exile.&quot;    Mr. Tebbit reminded his audience of wine-sipping journalists that the Liberals, the senior partners in the Alliance, have a record of cutting deals with Labor. They did it almost a decade ago, saving a Labor government from defeat and setting up the disastrous Winter of Discontent, when Britain almost ground to a halt through labor disputes and mass picketing.    &quot;It's a great honor to be singled out by Mr. Tebbit,&quot; says the Social Democrats' Mr. Newby. &quot;But it's a little annoying too. What he is saying is demonstrably not true. People don't believe David Steel (the Liberal leader) and David Owen (the Social Democratic leader) are socialists.&quot;    The Liberals' Mr. Beith points out, too, that his party's pact with Labor ended months before the Winter of Discontent of 1978-79. &quot;It is grotesquely inaccurate to say we had anything to do with it,&quot; he says. It's also inaccurate, he adds, to say the Alliance, in a hung Parliament, would talk only with Labor. &quot;We're prepared to talk to all parties,&quot; says Mr. Beith.    Under these conditions, the timing of this election is everything. It's a tricky decision, and until it's made, no one in political life in Britain can get on with anything else. </TEXT></DOC>
