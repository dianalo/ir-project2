Barriersystems are required to isolate radioactive defense wastes currentlystored at Hanford. Under a plan to permanently isolate these wastes,low-level defense wastes will remain at Hanford. High-level wastes andthose wastes with a long half-life will be sent either to a geologicrepository for commercial nuclear waste or to the Waste Isolation PilotPlant in New Mexico. The disposal program for nuclear defense wastesis independent of the search for a commercial nuclear waste repository.</TEXT></DOC>
