Cattle rancher Darli Alves da Silva and his sons Darcy Pereirada Silva and Oloci Alves da Silva escaped from prison in the Amazoncity of Rio Branco on Saturday, officer Manuel de Brito Ramos said.   News of the escape from Francisco de Oliveira Conde Penitentiarywas made public only Wednesday, he said.   Ramos said two guards were sent to da Silva's cell afterauthorities learned the three men had obtained revolvers andplanned a breakout.   The da Silvas overpowered the guards, dashed about 125 feetacross a courtyard and scaled the 11-foot prison wall, Ramos saidby telephone from Rio Branco, 2,650 miles northwest of Rio deJaneiro.   With just two wall sentries on duty during the New Year'sholiday weekend, the alarm was not sounded.   However, Darli Alves da Silva injured himself in jumping off thewall into thick brush. The da Silvas fled into the wilderness butpolice quickly mounted a search and captured them about an hourlater, he said.   ``Darli's older and very thin and couldn't take the fall,'' saidRamos. ``Otherwise, they might have made it.''   Da Silva, indicted in August on a charge of ordering Mendes'death, and his sons have been held at the 150-inmate penetentiaryfor a year awaiting trial.   Darcy Pereira, 21, was indicted for carrying out the shooting.Police said he confessed. Oloci Alves, 22, was arrested as anaccomplice.   Mendes, 44, was shot on Dec. 22, 1988, at his house in thebackwoods Amazon town of Xapuri, 105 miles northwest of Rio Branconear the Bolivian border.   Mendes was head of a local rubber tappers union that blockedranchers' efforts to clear the rain forest for grazing. He had ledprotests in which family and community members stood in front ofbulldozers.   In 1987, Mendes received the United Nations Global 500 award forhis work to protect the Amazon. He was an environmental watchdogfor the World Bank and other international lending institutions inEngland and West Germany.   Mendes successfully campaigned in May 1988 to stop da Silva fromcutting down a stand of virgin rain forest on his property. Mendesoften said the rancher threatened to kill him. Da Silva denied it.   The issue of developing the Amazon jungle has often erupted intobloody clashes between large landowners on one side and ecologistsand peasant farmers on the other.   The government estimates that more than 800 people have died inland conflicts since 1980. Many rural leaders and the churchactivists who advise them were victims.</TEXT></DOC>
