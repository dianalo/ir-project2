 We evaluateseven high-speed modems from ATI Technologies, Hayes Microcomputer Products,Microcom, Multi-Tech Systems, Telebit Corp., Universal Data Systems, and U.S.andO;Robotics.andP;  Although these modems carry retail price tags ranging from $699 to$1,345, quantity discounts and mail-order prices are usually available.andM;ESTABLISHING COMMUNICATIONandM;Since phone lines are designed to carry sounds, they're not suitable forconveying the digital data signals in your computer.andP;  Phone signals passthrough countless transformers and switching stations while they travel fromorigin to destination; digital signals would simply get lost en route.andP;  Amodem converts digital bits from your PC to analog tones more suitable fortelephone lines.andP;  The receiving modem then converts the tones back to digitalbits for subsequent processing by a PC.andM;When you make a voice call, the person at the receiving end usually answers,&quot;Hello.&quot;andP;  You respond with your name, and the conversation begins.andP;  Modemswork much the same way, handshaking to establish communications.andP;  When yourmodem calls another, the second modem responds with a set of answer tones.andO;The two modems then negotiate to find out how to communicate with each other.andO;The underlying procedure, called a renegotiation protocol, helps the modemsdetermine which signaling, error-correction, and data compression protocolsto follow.andM;First they go through a series of questions and answers, establishing firstwhat kinds of modems they are and then what transfer rate they are going touse.andP;  Usually this handshake assumes the fastest send rate, negotiating downto the highest common rate.andP;  Noise on the telephone line may lower thesignaling rate further.andM;Next, the modems negotiate whether a hardware error-correction protocol isavailable, starting with the highest protocol level for error correction anddata compression.andP;  When negotiations are complete, the modems normallytransfer control to the PC software for processing.andM;MODEM TALKandM;Modems typically need some instructions concerning what you want to do.andP;  Thecomputer sends a set of characters called a configuration string to the modemand tells it how to communicate with your computer, your phone line, andother modems.andP;  You usually use the Hayes Standard AT Command Set or aderivative to tailor your modem's configuration; you can even send Hayescommands directly to your modem to place and answer phone calls.andP;  But thesecommands stop at making the connection; you need more software to performsuch activities as transferring files.andP;  Once connected, your communicationssoftware handles those chores.andM;Even though the Hayes Command Set is a de facto standard, compatibilityremains a problem.andP;  A modem isn't necessarily compatible simply because itdials a number in response to the ATDT command; various companies implementmany other important commands differently (for more information see &quot;InsideTalk: 2,400-bps PS/2 Modems,&quot; PC Magazine, July 1989).andP;  You might need toconsult both the modem vendor and the vendor of your communications softwareto get all of your modem's features correctly initialized.andM;ASYNCHRONOUS VS.andP;  SYNCHRONOUSandM;Most modems offer a range of transmission modes or connections to a varietyof environments.andP;  PC-to-PC modem transmissions generally use the asynchronousmode.andP;  In asynchronous transmissions, the modem sends each characterindependently, with certain bits announcing the arrival and completion of thecharacter.andM;The synchronous mode provides connectivity from PCs or terminals to mainframecomputers.andP;  In synchronous format, transmit and receive clocks at both endsof the link control the precise timing of the characters sent in a block.andO;All the hardware in the link (mainframe port, modems, and PC or terminal)must operate using a single clocking source.andM;Several synchronous protocols help format and transmit data.andP;  These includeSynchronous Data Link Control (SDLC), High-level Data Link Control (HDLC),and Binary Synchronous Control (BI-SYNC).andP;  These protocols format the datainto blocks, add control information, and check this information to provideerror control.andM;THE NEED FOR SPEEDandM;PC users deserve much of the credit for driving the improvements in thetechnology of modems for dial-up lines.andP;  Since the telephone companies andinformation services bill by the minute, they have no incentive to providefast hardware.andP;  Ten years ago in the United States, roughly when IBM wasmaking plans to introduce its first PC, the Bell Operating Company standardsfor dial-up telephone lines (Bell 103 and Bell 212) described 300- and1,200-baud signaling speeds.andP;  Modems for these speeds carried prices of over$400 in less-inflated dollars.andM;As PC hardware and software systems evolved, files got bigger and modems wereused for increasingly complex tasks, such as remote control of networked PCs.andO;Four years ago, Rockwell International Corp. and other manufacturers madechip sets available for modems following the international V.22bis standards.andO;The price of these modems is well under $300 today.andM;As PC users moved an ever-growing volume of data through modems, theydemanded even higher throughput rates.andP;  Hayes Microcomputer Products,Microcom, and U.S.andP;  Robotics soon rose to the challenge by offering fastermodems using proprietary transfer protocols.andP;  These worked their high-speedmagic when connected with like modems but regressed to the standard 2,400 and1,200 bps when a modem from another manufacturer sat at the other end.andM;ENTER STANDARDSandM;The International Consultative Committee on Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT inFrench) established the V.32 standard to avert the creation of an electronicTower of Babel by manufacturers with their proprietary standards (see thesidebar &quot;The Modem Alphanumeric Jungle&quot;).andP;  The V.32 standard describes howmodems should talk to each other using two-way signaling at 4,800 and 9,600bps over dial-up telephone lines.andM;Unfortunately the V.32 standard did not provide a method for error control.andO;Since V.32 signaling is more sensitive to noise and echoes on the telephoneline than lower-speed protocols are, you need a hardware- or software-drivenerror-control scheme to retain accuracy.andM;Microcom developed its own standard for asynchronous data error control,Microcom Network Protocol (MNP).andP;  Versions of MNP Classes 2, 3, and 4 are nowavailable in a variety of modems and communications software packages.andP;  Thesoftware implements the error control protocols either in an application orin a modem's ROM, and the error checking operates independently of thesignaling scheme used by the modem.andM;Last year, the CCITT issued a hardware-implemented asynchronouserror-correction standard called V.42, which describes two error-correctionschemes.andP;  The primary protocol is named Link Access Procedure for Modems(LAPM).andP;  The secondary or support protocol is functionally the same as MNPClass 4.andP;  If you want to communicate between two modems claiming to be V.42compliant, you should connect them using the LAPM protocol.andP;  If you use oneV.42-compliant modem and another compliant with MNP 4, you should employ theMNP 4 protocol.andP;  The LAPM method offers slightly better error recovery andreliability than MNP 4.andM;While the V.42 and MNP 4 protocols help maintain reliability, they don'timprove throughput.andP;  After you increase the electrical signaling rate as muchas possible and improve reliability, the next step in turbocharging involvesfile compression.andP;  When you compress files to remove redundant data or emptysections, the time it takes to send them across the telephone line decreases.andM;It's possible to compress files prior to transmission using PKZIP or othercompression products, bu the recipient must then decompress the file beforeit is usable.andP;  While compressing and decompressing files on the fly is easierfor all involved, our tests at PC LAN Labs show that you get the bestthroughput by handling compression as a separate step before startingtransmission.andM;DATA COMPRESSION PROTOCOLSandM;Microcom again led the industry by introducing the MNP Class 5data-compression protocol.andP;  It soon became a feature in many modems and someapplication programs.andP;  Software supporting the MNP 5 protocol offers theability to compress files to half their original size during transmission.andM;In late 1989, the CCITT issued the V.42bis standard (bis comes from theFrench word for revision), describing how to implement data compression onthe fly in hardware.andP;  Using the Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm, the new V42bis protocol potentially offers 35 percent greater data compression thanMNP 5.andP;  For a 9,600-bps modem, this means a potential throughput of 38,400bps for files with repeating patterns.andP;  For most file transfers, however, youcan expect throughput of around 19,200 bps for files not previouslycompressed through other means (see the sidebar &quot;Data Compression: Is It AllIt Claims?&quot;).andM;The V.42bis standard adapts to the data flow more quickly than MNP 5, turningdata compression off and on as required by using an automatic feedbackmechanism.andP;  This gives it an advantage over MNP 5 when transmittingpreviously compressed files, since the MNP 5 compression algorithm can causecompressed files to expand, reducing overall throughput.andP;  Consequently, itsusers often must manually disable the MNP 5 protocol when transmitting orreceiving previously compressed files.andP;  V.42bis compression software worksonly with software that uses the V.42 error-correction protocol.andP;  All of themodems we found on the market with V.42bis also include MNP 5 as analternative protocol.andM;It's important to understand that the V.32 standard primarily describes theelectrical signaling scheme used over the telephone wire.andP;  In this way, V.32resembles the V.22bis, Bell 103, and Bell 212 standards.andP;  Other standards,such as MNP, V.42, and V.42bis, describe actions taking place above the levelof electrical signaling.andP;  So you can have modems using different combinationsof signaling and error correction protocols.andP;  The modems in this review useV.32 signaling with V.42 error correction and V.42bis compression.andO;Coincidentally, they also offer MNP error detection and file compression.andM;FUTURE STANDARDSandM;A modem using V.32 signaling with V.42bis error correction and compression isnot the last modem you'll ever need.andP;  The CCITT is evaluating a revision tothe V.32 standard, appropriately named V.32bis.andP;  V.32bis adds 7,200-,12,000-, and 14,400-bps transfer rates and a faster renegotiation protocol.andO;V.32bis will be able to renegotiate the protocol in less than 100milliseconds.andP;  The standard is expected to receive final approval from theCCITT by February 1991, and vendors should have V.32bis modems and upgradesavailable by spring or summer.andM;Note the recent availability of V.22bis modems with 2,400-bps signaling andV.42bis data compression.andP;  Most new 2,400-bps modems should be V.42biscompatible within a year.andM;The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) also waits somewhere down theroad for many of us.andP;  ISDN can convert analog telephone lines to digitallines, making them more compatible for computers transferring voice andgraphics.andP;  Many telephone systems are converting to digital capability, butISDN is not widespread and will nto be fully implemented in thiscountry--much less the rest of the world--for a long time.andP;  So don't wait forISDN if you need high-speed wide-area connectivity now.andP;  Wait for a newV.32bis/V.42/V.42bis modem next spring; or it you can't wait, get an upgradepromise from your vendor.andM;REVIEW CRITERIAandM;For this review, we considered only those modems using V.32 signaling withV.42 error checking and V.42bis data compression, the fastest availablewithin CCITT published standards.andP;  Not many modems met those criteria; theV.42bis standard is relatively new and costly, and many vendors have delayedthe introduction of V.42bis modems because of patent and licensing problems.andM;One of the products tested, the Hayes V-Series Ultra Smartmodem 9600, offersimpressive performance for a small box.andP;  When people in the PC market thinkof modems, they still think of Hayes as the standard of comparison.andP;  Modemsfrom U.S.andP;  Robotics constitute a different kind of standard.andP;  The companyrecently upgraded its Courier HST Dual Standard to include V.42 and V.42bis.andO;Because of U.S.andP;  Robotics' generous price breaks, most electronic bulletinboard systems (BBSs) in the U.S.andP;  use HST modems.andP;  HST's compatibility withBBSs might be an important factor in your purchasing decision.andM;The other modems we tested were the ATI 9600etc/e, the Microcom QX/4232hs,Multi-Tech Systems' Multi-ModemV32 MT932EAB, the Telebit T2500, and UniversalData Systems' FasTalk V.32/V42b.andP;  The Ven-Tel EC9600- Plus/II arrived toolate for review, and Practical Peripherals' new model PM9600SA and Intel's9600EX did not begin shipping until after our deadline.andP;  Other modem vendorsplan to sell models in this arena but remain in the legal and engineeringstages of development.andM;THE PACKandM;A comparison of the modems revealed many similarities.andP;  All of the modems weexamined are external.andP;  While the vendors package each modem with an RJ-11Cline cord and telephone plug, in all cases you must furnish your own RS-232Ccable.andP;  Normally you would use a DB-25P male-to-male cable for mostcomputers.andM;Each modem can store at least one default configuration to initialize themodem at power-up.andP;  These default settings are programmable through yourcommunications software.andM;The Hayes, Microcom, Multi-Tech, and U.S.andP;  Robotics factory-defaultconfigurations let our communications program immediately call and answerother V.32/V.42/V.42bis installations.andP;  The ATI, Telebit, and Universal DataSystems modems required reading the manual and programming the units toachieve V.32/V.42/V.42bis data transfers.andP;  This isn't hard, but it doesrequire some knowledge of modems and their command sets.andP;  If any questionsarise, all of these vendors offer technical support.andM;The vendors seem to have solved the problem of complying with the standards,but maintaining compatibility between modems of different vendors is aseparate problem.andP;  All seven modems comply with V.32/V.42/V.42bis standards.andO;This means that each modem connected and negotiated properly using thesestandards when connected to like modems.andP;  But in many instances, modems fromone vendor would not connect to another vendor's modems with all threeprotocols in force.andP;  Nevertheless, the attitude of every company sounds anupbeat note; they all vow to work for intercorporate compatibility, but theyaren't there yet.andM;The reasons for incompatibility are not always apparent, but they primarilyinvolve differences in timing or performance thresholds during thehandshaking cycle.andP;  Each vendor uses its own method and sequence forconducting the protocol handshake, and three offer additional proprietaryprotocols.andP;  Since the handshake method and order of the protocols mayinfluence the final protocol agreement, we strongly recommend that youpurchase all your high-speed modems from the same vendor, or at least testthe modems for compatibility before you close the deal.andM;ANOTHER WEAK LINK?andM;Even with the fastest modem in town, you might not be ready to burn up thephone lines yet.andP;  We found another weak link in the communications chain.andM;Initially we set up our performance tests with two relatively fast DellSystem 220s.andP;  These AT clones function as our workhorses in most of ourworkstation LAN testing.andP;  But the modem results disappointed us right fromthe start.andP;  The receiving computer just couldn't keep up with the data flowfrom the sending side.andP;  A little investigation revealed that the Dell System220 contained the old 8250 UART chip usually found in XT machines.andP;  NormallyAT clones include the faster 16450 UART.andM;UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) chips control the serialport.andP;  During modem communications, the PC's UART and the CPU transfer agreat deal of information.andP;  Unfortunately, if the communications program asksthe CPU to manage large changes on the screen or to move data to and from thehard disk, the UART on the receiving side can drop bits, particularly if itruns under a multitasking environment like DESQview, Microsoft Windows, orOS/2.andM;The new 16550 UART solves the problem by creating a FIFO (first in, firstout) buffer stack.andP;  This buffer allows the UART to save any incoming datawhile waiting on the CPU.andP;  Once we changed to faster machines (a pair of ALRPowerCache 4s) with the 16550 UART, our reception problems disappeared.andO;Although the 16550 acts as a direct replacement for the 8250 and 16450, itneeds communications software that initializes it to use its FIFO stack.andO;Luckilly, most modern communications programs do.andM;If your old 8250 or 16450 UART still occupies a socket, you can purchase anew 16550 and replace the chip for less than $15.andP;  Anyone interested inhigh-speed modem communications will find this a good investment.andM;FLYING FASTandM;Once you've flown at 38,000 bps, it's difficult to grind along at slowerspeeds.andP;  The speed and functionality of these modems is addictive.andP;  If you oryour business currently uses 2,400-bps modems on phone lines for an hour eachday, a V.32/V.42/V.42bis modem can pay for itself through reduced phone costsin less than six months.andP;  The arithmetic is easy.andP;  Can you afford beingwithout a high-speed modem?andM;EDITOR'S CHOICEandM;MultiModemV32 MT932EABandM;If you're looking into purchasing one of the modems reviewed here, chancesare you're buying for speed.andP;  A pair of V.32/V.42bis modems will pay forthemselves in a few months by shortening the time you spend on long-distancecalls.andP;  Thus, our Editor's Choice decision is strongly influenced bythroughput, along with ease of use.andM;Some products, particularly the Hayes V-Series Ultra Smartmodem 9600, offerX.25 and a variety of other connection options.andP;  If you want those options,then the Hayes becomes the clear and comfortable choice as high-qualityproduct at a competitive price.andP;  Hayes has also made efforts to ensurecompatibility with modems from different companies.andM;From the perspective of performance and ease of use, however, Multi-TechSystems' MultiModem V32 MT932EAB wins our approval as Editor's Choice.andP;  Thisproduct usually moved data at least as fast as any other modem under avariety of conditions, and it's ready to work right out of the box.andM;The Microcom QX/4232hs deserves an honorable mention for its speed.andP;  Thecompany holds a strong reputation as a leader in setting technical standards.andO;Yet we generally prefer the Multi-Tech modem's ease of use.andM;The runner-up for reliability and stability is the ATI 9600etc/e.andP;  With itswinning price tag of $699, the modem's full retail cost beats even the streetprice of competing products.andP;  The ATI 9600etc/e wasn't as compatible withother vendors' products as the Hayes, but when two ATI modems were talkingtogether durint our tests, they worked through tough conditions without anabort.andM;Meanwhile, new modems are evolving quickly, and all of the companies assureus that they will work out their compatibility differences within the nextfew months.andM;THE MODEM ALPHANUMERIC JUNGLEandM;If we didn't have standards, every modem company would use proprietaryprotocols and no one could communicate using another vendor's modem.andP;  Keepingtrack of the standards often means keeping track of the lingo, and in theworld of telecommunications, the lingo translates into some fairly arcanegroups of letters and numbers.andP;  Nevertheless, before you shop for modems, youneed to familiarize yourself with the terminology.andM;If your modem meets the latest standards, chances are that it can takeadvantage of recent developements in the telephone network and incommunications software.andP;  These developments help make possible faster speedsand more reliable error correction.andM;The International Consultative Committee on Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT)sets the standards that ensure international telephone systems connectivity.andO;The CCITT identifies standards on modem data transmission with the letter Vfollowed by a period and a number.andP;  Sometimes the letters bis follow thenumber.andP;  Bis is a French term meaning second version; it denotes a revisionof a protocol, not necessarily an extension of the previous version.andM;The field of modem communications is filled with other terms with similarlyexplicit meanings.andP;  Following is a guide through the alphanumeric jungle ofcommon modem terminology:andM;MODULATION PROTOCOLSandM;Bell 103/113 Asynchronous full-duplex modem transmission at up to 300 bitsper second.andM;Bell 212 Asynchronous and synchronous full-duplex modem transmission at 1,200bps.andM;HST U.S.andP;  Robotics' High Speed Technology: a proprietary modulation allowingconnection speeds of up to 14,400 bps.andP;  Data flows asymmetrically, at thehigh speed in one direction and at 450 bps in the other.andP;  The modemdynamically negotiate, assigning the high-speed channel to the modem with themost data to transmit.andM;PEP Packetized Ensemble Protocol: a Telebit proprietary modulation protocolthat analyzes the quality of the phone connection at connect time anddynamically compensates for line impairments at 511 separate frequencypoints.andM;V.21 Full-duplex modem transmission at up to 300 bps, also used for Group 3fax negotiation.andM;V.22 Half-duplex modem transmission at 600 bps and 1,200 bps, with a reversechannel (used mostly for responses during file transfers) at up to 75 bps.andM;V.22bis Full-duplex modem transmission at 1,200 and 2,400 bps, with fall-backto V.22.andM;V.32 Full-duplex modem transmission at 4,800 and 9,600 bps.andM;V.32bis The V.32 protocol extended to speeds of 7,200, 12,000, and 14,400bps, and with an improved renegotiation protocol.andM;ERROR CONTROL PROTOCOLSandM;MNP 2, 3, or 4 Microcom Network Protocol: a proprietary, licensederror-control protocol.andP;  The number indicate specific versions or classes.andM;V.42 A standard error-control protocol, backward-compatible with MNP 2, 3,and 4.andM;COMPRESSION PROTOCOLSandM;MNP 5 Microcom's proprietary, licensed data-compression protocol.andM;V.42bis An international standard for data compression.andM;OTHER TERMINOLOGYandM;Baud An obsolete term defining the number of signal-level changes per second.andO;The CCITT now prefers to use symbols per second.andP;  For example, a V.22bisconnection transfers only 600 symbols per second, but in this protocol eachsymbol can represent up to four values; thus, you have an effectivetransmission rate of 2,400 bps.andP;  V.32 is a 2,400-symbol-per-second(9,600-bps) modulation protocol.andM;Duplex The direction of data flow between modems.andP;  Half duplex means thatdata can flow in only one direction at a time.andP;  Data flows both directionssimultaneously for full duplex.andM;Throughput  The effective rate of data flow for a file transfer, measured inbits per second.andP;  Throughput depends on the connect rate and the error-contrland data-compression protocols, if any.andP;  For example, V.32 indicates anactual 9,600-bps transmission rate.andP;  But when you subtract the extra bitsused for error control, the effective rate becomes slightly slower.andP;  IfV.42bis compression can cut a file size in half, the throughput for the filetransfer can approach 19,200 bps.andM;Trellis coding A signal coding scheme.andP;  V.32 defines two such coding schemesfor 9,600-bps communications: nonredundant coding and trellis coding.andO;Trellis coding is more noise-resistant except in the presence of an unusualline problem called impulse noise.andM;UART Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter, the chip that controls theinput/output of the serial port.andM;DATA COMPRESSION: IS IT ALL IT CLAIMS?andM;If your business transfers files over telephone lines and doesn't use datacompression, you are wasting time and money.andM;Several popular file-compression utilities are available, including Lharc, afreeware program, and PKZIP, a shareware program.andP;  Both offer highfile-compression rates.andP;  If you compress your files using one of theseutilities prior to transmission, you won't need to use V.42bis or MNP5 tocompress them from the modem.andP;  In fact, as our tests show, MNP 5 can slowdown your throughput by expanding a file during transmission.andP;  It won'tcorrupt the file, however, since the receiving modem eventually strips thebits added to the compressed file.andM;Of the two popular off-line compression programs, Lharc normally offersslightly better compression.andP;  PKZIP compressess and expands files muchfaster.andP;  Software companies are well aware of the power of these utilities.andO;For example, CorelDRAW, Version 1.21B, comes on Seven 360K floppy disks.andP;  Theinstallation process uses Lharc to expand the program's files.andP;  Without Lharcor another file-compression routine, CorelDRAW would easily consume 14 ormore disks.andP;  You can find Lharc and PKZIP both in PC Magnet's UtilitiesDatabase and in Library 2 of its Utiliforum/Tips Forum under the filenamesLH113C.EXE and PKZ110.EXE.andM;THROUGHPUT TESTINGandM;The chart in Figure 1 shows the impact of two types of on-the-fly datacompression (V.42bis and MNP 5), along with one software compression scheme(PKZIP, Version 1.10), on the throughput of seven types of data files.andP;  Weused two MultiModem V32 MT932EAB units for these tests.andP;  An XT clone fromSyntax Computer, attached to one of these modems, transferred the files fromits RAM disk.andP;  An AST Premium/286 Model 140 with an AST FastBoard 386 wasattached to the other modem and received the files.andM;The repeated character file, 43,008 bytes large, included a single repeatedASCII character.andP;  The mixed data file comprised different types of data,including text, assembly language code, dBASE records, and repeatedcharacters; it totaled 44,032 bytes.andP;  The hex numbers file was a CCITT filecontaining a random selection of hexadecimal numbers; it measured 64,512bytes.andP;  The databse data file, a 77,724-byte CCITT file, was also used in ourmodem performance tests.andP;  The spreadsheet file, generated by Quattro Pro,totaled 43,250 bytes.andP;  The .TIF graphics file originated from an image wescanned in using the Logitech hand scanner ScanMan Plus; we cleaned it upwith PaintShow, Version 2.1, and the resultant file measured 54,272 bytes.andO;The ZIP compressed file--compressed by PKZIP prior to transmission--measured52,224 bytes.andM;COMPRESSION TESTandM;CONCLUSIONSandM;The files with many repreated characters and blank spaces enjoyed compressionrates u nder PKZIP far beyond the compression performed by on-the-flyalgorithms.andP;  The transmission of the file containing the repeated ASCIIcharacter went so fast after off-line compression that the throughput numbercould only by approximated.andP;  V.42bis gave the best improvement we found usingon-the-fly protocols; on the repeated-character test, it produced more thanthree times the throughput we measured using an uncompressed file.andM;Most computer bulletin board systems store their files in compressed form.andO;As our test results show, people using MNP 5-compatible modems should turnoff MNP 5 before downloading compressed files (precompression only confusesthis protocol, which then expands the file instead of compressing it).andO;V.42bis does not have that disadvantage.andP;  It offers real-time data-flowmonitoring, turning data compression off and on as needed.andM;Overall, on-the-fly compression with V.42bis rates as the most desirable andeconomical mode of operation for most applications.andP;  But if you really wantto squeeze the most of your communications lines, compress the files with anexternal file-compression utility before transmission, and don't use MNP 5for already compressed files.andM;Compression, through either hardware or software, is the best way to savetime and money during data transfers.andP;  If you are not taking advantage offile compression, someone else is taking advantage of you.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
