Norbec Ltd., an offshore oil-marketing arm of the kingdom, began chartering crude-oil tankers this week amid signs of a severe slump in the kingdom's petroleum exports. After being out of the tanker market for months, Norbec's chartering of five very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, took shipping industry officials by surprise.    Shipping-industry sources calculated the total capacity of the five VLCCs at 1.3 million tons -- equal to 10 million barrels. &quot;Market sources tell us Norbec is still looking for additional tonnage,&quot; said one tanker owner.    The tanker transactions underscore Saudi Arabia's resolve to produce its quota of 4.3 million barrels a day as set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Saudi Oil Minister Hisham M. Nazer has emphasized on several recent occasions that the kingdom wouldn't resume its former role of adjusting production up or down according to demand for OPEC -- or world -- oil &quot;under any circumstances.&quot;    Some industry sources suggested that the Saudis are intent on rebuilding the huge strategic offshore stockpile that they used to push for market share during the 1986 oil-price collapse. Storage in the tankers, parked outside the tense Persian Gulf and close to Saudi Arabia's major markets, peaked at between 60 million barrels and 65 million barrels, according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly.    But Mr. Nazer phased out the offshore stockpile after he replaced Ahmed Zaki Yamani, who was fired as the kingdom's oil minister more than a year ago.    Sources close to the Saudis have a simpler explanation for Norbec's sudden re-emergence in the tanker market: Additional, but probably temporary, storage facilities are urgently needed if the kingdom continues pumping oil at current rates. It has run out of storage space despite onshore capacity of 52 million barrels.    Excess supplies and weak oil markets have caused oil sales by Saudi Arabia and by others in OPEC to drop sharply this year. The Norbec move, for example, came amid reports that OPEC production is at the lowest level since early last summer.    Petro-Logistics Ltd., of Geneva, Switzerland, which closely monitors oil exports and production of OPEC's 13 member nations, estimates total output at 16.5 million barrels a day for the first three weeks of January. That's more than two million barrels a day under last month's level and &quot;means that OPEC is within the parameters set by the December agreement,&quot; said Conrad Gerber, president of Petro-Logistics.    In December, 12 members of OPEC -- with Iraq excluded -- agreed to maintain output at 15.1 million barrels a day or less through the first six months of 1988 to help wring excess supplies out of world markets. Iraq, then producing 2.8 million barrels a day, refused to sign the pact after failing to win the same quota as its war foe, Iran. But Iraq's output now is 2.4 million barrels, equal to Iran's quota.    Mr. Gerber estimates Saudi Arabian production at under 3.5 million barrels a day. But he said his assessment, based in part on sea-borne crude exports, makes no allowance for onshore storage. Sources close to the Saudis said the kingdom is producing considerably more -- around 4.1 million barrels a day -- and is storing the unsold oil.    But, &quot;there is a technical problem with the (land) storage,&quot; said a source close to the Saudis. &quot;The tanks are full.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
