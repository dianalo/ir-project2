The smaller company, six-person computer and softwaredistributor Big Blue Products Inc., won the first round ofthe battle recently when the federal Trademark Trial andAppeal Board refused to cede the title to IBM. The board is abranch of the federal Patent and Trademark Office.</LP><TEXT>   The board said an administrative trial would be needed todetermine whether the public or the trade had come toassociate the nickname with IBM's typewriter ribbons or otherproducts. If not, Big Blue Products, of Northport, N.Y.,apparently would be allowed to keep its name.   The dispute centers around IBM's 1989 application toregister Big Blue as a trademark for a new line of typewriterribbons. Big Blue Products opposed the registration,contending that it had used the trademark since 1984,although it had not registered the name. The Patent andTrademark Office has not yet agreed to register the name toeither company.   IBM maintains in its court papers that it has the superiorclaim to the name, because &quot;since the 1960s the nickname BIGBLUE has been used publicly by the trade, by the news mediaand by the general public to identify IBM.&quot; To support itsclaim, IBM submitted more than 500 newspaper and magazinearticles where the term &quot;Big Blue&quot; was used in associationwith the computer giant.   Big Blue Products argued that the articles failed to showthat the public identifies the nickname with IBM. It alsopointed out that IBM had for many years objected to thereference, considering it a derisive reference to thecompany's size and power. The nickname apparently referredoriginally to the color of IBM's large mainframe computers.   In its opinion early this month, the board said itrecognized that a company may have a protectable right in theuse of a nickname, even though it hasn't capitalized on it.But it noted that &quot;the use by the public of a term to referto a company and/or its products or services does not meanthat the company has obtained rights to exclude others fromusing the same term for any product or service, and itcertainly does not mean that the company has obtained rightsto register the term as a mark for any product or service.&quot;   About two years ago, the computer giant began a campaignto protect the name by pursuing legal action againstimitators, while trying to register Big Blue with the Patentand Trademark Office. After talks with two companies -- a NewYork winery and a Louisiana computer company -- IBM agreed toleave them alone, as long as there was no confusion aboutwhich company marketed the products, an IBM spokesman said.   Patent lawyers say the nickname doctrine recognizes that acompany has a protected right in a nickname, even though ithas done nothing to promote the name. What is key is that thepublic associates the name with a particular company and thatconfusion would arise if another company uses the same name,they say.   Roger Schechter, a trademark professor at GeorgeWashington University's National Law Center, says that overthe years companies have won the right to protect nicknameslike Coke (Coca-Cola Co.), Bud (Budweiser), Met (MetropolitanOpera), HOJO (Howard Johnson), HOG (Harley Davidson Inc.) andBug (Volkswagen AG). &quot;Can you market a brand of french friescalled Golden Arches?&quot; Mr. Schechter asked rhetorically.   ---   MERRILL LYNCH sues three former employees over allegedbribery scheme.

A federal judge approved a $540,000 jury award to baseballHall of Famer Joe Morgan, who sued the department after apoliceman allegedly roughed him up three years ago at the LosAngeles International Airport. The award, reached at the endof a trial last February, included $450,000 in punitivedamages against the officer.   Mr. Morgan said he was waiting for a connecting flightwhen he was grabbed, thrown to the ground and handcuffed byofficers who claimed he resembled a suspected drug courier'scompanion.
