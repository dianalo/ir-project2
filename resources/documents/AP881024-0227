The consent decree filed in Denver U.S. District Court ends thelegal dispute between the two companies that began when BlueMountain Arts of Boulder filed a $50 million lawsuit in July 1986against Hallmark.   The card war had been scheduled to go to trial Jan. 2 in federalcourt here. At issue were a line of cards, featuring watercolor artand free-verse messages, which Blue Mountain created and Hallmarkallegedly copied.   Under terms of the consent decree, Hallmark will stop publishingits Personal Touch line of cards, discontinue use of the PersonalTouch name and take steps to repurchase the cards from Hallmarkstores.   Blue Mountain had alleged that Hallmark's Personal Touch line ofgreeting cards was deceptively similar to Blue Mountain's``Airebrush Feelings'' and ``WaterColor Feelings.''   The decree also stipulates a monetary settlement, but neitherHallmark nor Blue Mountain would disclose the amount.   Last week, Hallmark lost a bid in the U.S. Supreme Court tooverturn an injunction prohibiting Hallmark from distributing the83 cards in its Personal Touch line.   ``We are absolutely thrilled with this decree,'' said SusanPolis Schutz, poet and co-founder of Blue Mountain. ``This isimportant not only for us, but for all artists and businesses.''   Bob Gall, general manager of Blue Mountain, said that while thedecree requires Hallmark to pay a damage settlement, that is notthe decree's most important aspect.   ``We feel the emphasis in the case is not money, but thatartists and businesses around the country can feel free to createwithout fear of being copied,'' he said.   Hallmark said one of the key points in the agreement with BlueMountain was that it will introduce a new card line with a new nameto replace Personal Touch. The company said it agreed not todevelop products similar in appearance to Blue Mountain's.   The Kansas City card manufacturer also said it agreed in thesettlement not to pressure Hallmark outlets to refuse Blue Mountainproducts for sale. And it said the agreement provides that neitherside admit liability or wrongdoing.   ``We have found common ground with Blue Mountain because we areinterested in promoting fair competition while protecting bothcompanies' trademarks,'' Irv Hockaday, president and chiefexecutive officer of Hallmark, said.   Blue Mountain attorney Hary Melkonian of Los Angeles said theconsent decree was ``a convenient way to resolve the lawsuitwithout the ordeal of a trial, since little else could have beengained.''</TEXT></DOC>
