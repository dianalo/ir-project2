SEYMOUR VS DVORAKandM;As much as we'd all like to pay less for everything, and despite the generaldownward trend in the costs of serious PCs over the past few years, I thinkprices for the kinds of computers most of us buy have stabilized for the nextfew years.andM;We now have several well-established price points--perhaps I should say&quot;price regions,&quot; since they are approximate--for mainstream PCs.andP;  And thoseprices are going to remain about the same while the level of performance ateach point increases.andM;In other words, it looks like consumers are going to be trading economy forperformance.andM;Some examples of those price points: For low-end home PCs, that number is$750 to $1,000.andP;  For the emerging low-end office standards--fast 286s andespecially 386SXs--the neighborhood is $2,000 to $3,000.andP;  For mid-leveloffice PCs, we expect to pay $3,000 to $4,000.andP;  And for desktop power-houses,we pay $5,500 to $7,500.andP;  For low-end lap portables, the number is $600 to$1,000, and for higher performance lap machines, it's $2,500 to $3,500.andM;Of course there are exceptions, and of course I'm talking about what realbusiness pay for real computers--street prices.andP;  And I'm talking about thekinds of systems we usually buy, including video cards and displays, diskdrives, and memory configurations.andM;There are at least three reasons for this period of stability in PC pricing.andO;First, most of the fat has been wrung out of the PC-manufacturing system.andP;  Inthe early days of PCs, the technology was new and prices were high.andP;  IBMcharged me almost $5,000 for my first PC (and a pitiful, feeble thing it wasby today's standards).andP;  Now, thanks to the volume generated in the PC marketand competition from Asian Sources, prices for most PC parts have stabilized.andM;The prices of cases, chassis, connectors, disk drives, keyboards, and anassortment of other parts have just about bottomed out.andP;  There is still somedecline in the offing in video boards, and it looks as though memory pricesonce again are on a steady but very slow downward path.andM;While prices for CPU chips have fallen sharply over the years, you shouldn'texpect to see dramatic reductions in the prices of 386SX, 80386, and 80486chips any time soon.andP;  Market demand and Intel's monopoly on these designswill continue to hold CPU chip prices close to current levels.andP;  In any case,the CPU chip's cost is only a very small part of the total cost of the systemyou buy.andM;Second, most of the fat has been cut out of the distribution system.andP;  Thedays of ComputerLands, Businesslands, and WhateverLands selling all or mostof their systems and peripherals at manufacturers' highly inflated&quot;recommended list prices&quot; are gone forever.andP;  Computer retailers are much moreaggressive today, so the price spread is much narrower.andM;And mail-order PC dealers have proliferated.andP;  Their low overhead andhouse-brand systems work to hold down street prices--even of systems soldthrough other channels.andM;Third--and I know you'll really go ape over this one, John--prices arealready low enough.andM;The price a business pays to buy a PC for a worker is no longer a primaryfactor in deciding whether that worker will have access to one.andP;  ContinuingPC-support costs already far outweigh the initial hardware purchase costs.andO;And considering the costs of managing a worker, paying benefits, providingwork space, and so on, the $2,000 to $4,000 businesses spend on most desktopPCs is a minor issue.andM;Yeah, I knew that one would get you.andM;Sure, the several thousand dollars individuals spend on PCs is a lot ofmoney.andP;  I'd love to spend less.andP;  In fact, I just coughed up a small fortunefor a fast new 386 machine, and I thought about it long and hard.andP;  I hadplenty of much less expensive machines to choose from, John, but I decided onpower--just the way you did when you put that 386 on your desk.andM;This market is driven by business-PC purchases, and PC prices are currentlywithin reason for business purchases.andP;  The real issue for the next few yearswon't be how fast we can push PC prices down, but how fast we can push theirfunctionality and ease of use up at current price levels.andM;Face the facts, John, your pipe dreams about having $2,500 desktopsupercomputers next year just don't match reality.andM;One thing I like about Jim is his wishful thinking.andP;  Unfortunately, wishfulthinking doesn't jibe with the hard realities of the electronics game.andP;  Whatwe're arguing about here is whether the desktop computer will drop further inprice while maintaining performance increases.andP;  I suspect that within thenext few years, you'll be paying $399 for a simple XT-type machine, $899 fora 386 screamer, and $2,500 for the Crayon-a-desk.andP;  Eventually these pricesare bound to fall too.andM;What Jim hasn't noticed is that prices have already slid in this market andwill continue to do so.andP;  It's only natural if you understand the basicdepression mechanism at work.andP;  I mean depression as in Great Depression.andP;  Ofall the businesses in the world, the semiconductor-based electronics industryhas been in a deep depression since day one of its inception.andP;  Prices keepfalling.andP;  A chip that used to cost hundreds of dollars will soon costpennies.andP;  It's the nature of the business.andP;  Chips get cheaper by the day, andfunctionality increases.andM;It never ends.andP;  Some people call it a jelly bean business because the priceof chips is continually approaching the price of jelly beans.andM;Each new technology worsens this effect as hundreds of companies vie forleadership and market share with newer and cheaper manufacturing processes.andO;Once in a blue moon, the industry hiccups and prices zoom skyward, making alot of people rich.andP;  This was the case with the memory shortage two yearsback.andP;  It never lasts long, though--just long enough to sucker a bunch ofsideline bettors into the game and push capacity beyond demand.andM;When prices are constantly under pressure to fall and excess capacity is atheme, we have a depression.andP;  In fact, it's a classic depression--sellers,aware of the fact that their inventories will be worthless if kept too long(I wonder what 10MB hard disk are worth today compared with a year ago?),andO;must force prices down even further than normal by predicting future lowprices.andM;As most readers know, there is something in the computer business called alearning curve.andP;  This curve, most accurately applied to semiconductors, saysthat as efficiency accumulates and production increases, computer prices willfall accordingly.andP;  To get a jump on the competition, many manufacturers pricetheir products based on the predicted future price curve.andP;  They do this inorder to increase demand and gain market share.andP;  It's always hoped that ifthe company can stay in business for the duration of the run, then at somepoint in the future it will meet the learning curve crossover point and startmarking some money.andM;All that's really accomplished by this gambit, of course, is further pressureon the downward price spiral.andP;  The goal is never met--since the decisionitself steepens the downward price curve--and so even more aggressivestrategies are devised.andP;  It's an economic catch-22.andM;Just take a look at the makers of hard disks and how they come and go witheach generation of equipment.andP;  The Shugarts and CMIs of the world fall by thewayside as Seagate comes along.andP;  Seagate is then pushed aside by Conner.andO;Someday a new player is bound to arrive.andP;  This is a typical depressioneconomy for these folks.andP;  Each day inventory becomes worth less and less.andO;Companies go broke.andM;All these market machinations are passed down the line to the consumer--aconsumer who, I might add, expects eventually to find a $2,500Cray-on-a-desk.andP;  I sure do.andP;  Now we see the advent of RISC technology, whichwill hasten the process by making CPU performance faster than ever.andP;  Ifreaders think this industry was nuts in the 1980s, they're in for an evenwilder ride in the 1990s when micro-makers decide to sell minicomputers dirtcheap.andP;  Soon it will be mainframe power on a desk as we head toward the Cray.andM;Of course, neither I nor Jim has the foggiest notion as to what we're goingto do with all this power.andP;  But when you're presented with lots of cheapcomputer power, you always find some use for it.andP;  Nobody is going to complainabout all the power, that's for sure.andP;  &quot;Gee, that's too much power for me.andP;  Iwish this machine weren't so fast!&quot; The idea is ludicrous--kind of likethinking that the business is going to stabilize at Jim's perceived pricepoints.andP;  Jim, when a boulder is thrown off a 30,000-foot-tall mountain, itdoesn't stop falling when it gets to 20,000 feet, no matter how much we wishit would.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
