(DG) last week made good on a year-old promise with theNetWorld delivery of its implementation of Novell Inc.'s Portable NetWare.andM;The Westboro, Mass., minicomputer vendor introduced NetWare for AViiONSystems, and at the same time announced plans to develop similar networkingsystems based on two NetWare rivals -- Microsoft Corp.'s LAN Manager and LANManager/X.andP;  DG topped off its LAN layer cake with three additions to OpenLAN, part of its Distributed Applications Architecture (DAA) strategy.andM;&quot;Our Open LAN strategy is not specific to Novell,&quot; said Joseph Forgione, thefirm's director of DAA.andM;&quot;Novell has the largest installed base, so we are focusing on that first.andO;LAN Manager is second, and there could be other networking types we'llsupport under the Open LAN product family.&quot;andM;Banyan Systems Inc.'s VINES and IBM's LAN Server are also underconsideration, Forgione added.andM;The decision to work with Novell first and provide immediate access tooff-the-shelf applications that work with NetWare were encouraging signs toTom LaMarche, who currently uses DG's PCI integration system.andM;&quot;Trying to find shrink-wrapped software that works with PCI has been aproblem,&quot; said LaMarche, data systems manager for the Maricopa County FloodControl District in Phoenix, Ariz.andP;  &quot;Novell lets us go with a de factostandard and bring that into our DG environment.&quot;andM;DG's implementation of Portable NetWare for its DG/UX Unix operating systemprovides file- , print- and data-sharing services for network clients thatinclude DOS-based PCs, Windows/386 and OS/2 workstations, and Macintoshes.andO;Existing networking applications that run on native NetWare will operate withNetWare for AViiON, and Oracle Corp. will port a version of its Unix-basedrelational database-management system to the AViiON workstations, DGofficials said.andM;While Open LAN may not be specific to Novell, NetWare now stands at thecenter of the product family.andP;  Two of DG's new Open LAN products are based onthe Novell operating system: a version for DG's Eclipse MV/Family Systemsminis running the proprietary AOS/VS operating system, and a version for DG'sDasher 386 workstations.andP;  The third product, the Software Developers' Kit forAViiON PC LANs, includes Netwise Inc.'s remote procedure calls (RPCs), a setof tools used for creating client/server applications that operate ondifferent platforms, Forgione said.andM;&quot;[The Netwise RPCs] will be supported on other networking systems such as LANManager, so developers need only write an application once to work ondifferent networking platforms,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The RPC becomes a standardinterface to the underlying network.&quot;andM;NetWare for AViiON Systems, the developers' kit and NetWare for Dasher 386PCs are available 90 days after receipt of order.andP;  NetWare for MV systems isdue in the second half of the year, and LAN Manager support will be availableby year's end.andM;NetWare for AViiON is priced from $3,500 for an eight-user license to $13,000for 256 users.andP;  The developers' kit costs $9,935 for a one- to four-usersystem.andP;  A typical server configuration for Native NetWare on the Dasher 386PCs is $15,800.andM;DG can be reached at (800) 328-2436.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
