Chubb andTerry M. Moe (&quot;The Private vs. Public School Debate,&quot;editorial page, July 26) concerning the positive effects amarket-based policy could have on education. My concern isthat many who espouse the benefits of the freemarket systemtend to deify it as the cureall of our social ills. The freemarket provides an opportunity for individuals to expresstheir values and beliefs in their economic decisions. Thedata presented in the article would give the impression thatprivate schools are successful purely based on the fact thatpeople have chosen to be there. Conversely, since the publicschools have a monopoly on their students, they show inferiorresults.   I am very much an adherent of a free-market system. Choicein education sounds like an excellent idea, especially as Ihave three children ready to enter the educational system.But I realize that no economic system can replace the moralstability of a society and the values that are manifested bythe choices that each individual makes. I believe my childrenwill do well in their educational endeavors because I willgive them considerable time and attention to demonstrate thevalue I place on education (and because I love them). Theywon't care two bits as to whether Mom or Dad actually choosefor them to be in this or that school. What they will knowand understand is the commitment that we as parents have madein their young lives.</LP><TEXT>   I want to keep working for choice in education, but let'snot put the cart before the horse as to the real solution toour educational problem.
