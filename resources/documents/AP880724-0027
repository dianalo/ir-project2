(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ex-Republican presidential candidate PatRobertson says Democrats will be disappointed if they are hopingfor friction at the Republican National Convention between hissupporters and backers of Vice President George Bush.   ``We got what we wanted,'' Roberson said. ``I like the 1984platform, and we're in agreement to stick with it.''   Robertson, who pledged to campaign on Bush's behalf, attended aUnity '88 Republican rally Saturday in Charleston along with Gov.Carroll A. Campbell Jr. and Secretary of the Interior Donald Hodel.   The television evangelist said Democrat Michael Dukakis was the``most liberal candidate any party has nominated for thepresidency,'' and called the Democratic convention a ``carefullycrafted charade to make liberal Democrats look like moderateRepublicans.''   Roberston also said there would be no floor fights on platformissues at the GOP convention next month in New Orleans. However, hedid say he would like a plank calling for the nomination ofconservative candidates at all levels of the federal judiciary.   ``We want judges who will interpret the Constitution as the lawof the land,'' Robertson said, ``not rewrite the Constitution asthe law of the land.''   Robertson urged his followers to get behind Bush, predictingthey could provide the margin of victory in as many as 20 closelycontested states.</TEXT></DOC>
