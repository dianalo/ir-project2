(That will make the products move!)andM;In addition to Office Vision, the IBM office strategy will include productsfor decision support, data interpretation, UNIX support, FAX integration, andimage processing (watch out Unisys!).andM;Note: &quot;There will be an integration between business applications and officeapplications.&quot;andP;  That will permit users to call forth any application theyneed -- without entering or exiting an OA system.andP;  It will allow users &quot;toaccess host data and applications from the office environment.&quot;andP;  (that is amajor step forward.)andM;In recognition of the existence of the millions of PCs in the world, IBMpermits DOS machines (which are not SAA blessed) to access their new officeproducts -- but without the GUI (graphical user interface).andM;IBM made another major concession: they recognize the existence of non-IBMequipment!andP;  Some &quot;popular brands&quot; -- which means DEC -- can access IBMsoftware &quot;through third-party products.&quot;andM;&quot;SAA Office depends on the availability of a variety of applications.andP;  IBMmust attract partners [to write that software].&quot;andP;  So far, the attraction isweak.andM;The office strategy is important because it will afford the company moreopportunity to sell hardware, communications, and -- most importantly --service.andM;IBM's Office Vision goals are:andM;* comprehensive office applicationsandM;* focus on ease of use and productivityandM;* emphasis on intelligent workstationsandM;* integrate business applicationsandM;* provide availability across SAA platformsandM;* Evolve from the current product lineandM;There is a new Office Vision product -- and it is another &quot;first&quot; for IBM.andO;Office Vision/2 is based on client/server computing.andP;  (!) IBM, the veryfoundation of centralized/host-based computing, is offering a product thatneeds no host!andP;  (That is revolutionary!)andM;Office Vision/2 has a few problems:andM;* it is lateandM;* it doesn't work with X-WindowsandM;* it doesn't work with Novell networksandM;- which has produced some irate customersandM;- one IBM attendee volunteered, &quot;IBM is aware of the problem.&quot;andM;* the document composition portion &quot;is very limited&quot;andM;- it doesn't include a word processor -- you use your own (that's a goodfeature!)andM;The product has a list of good features -- including being WYSIWYG.andP;  (IBMwill be overjoyed to send you literature.)andM;&quot;There are darned few Presentation Management applications ready -- and manyof them are inconsistent!&quot;andM;&quot;Office Vision/2 is a good, well-implemented design and it looks like it hasthe robustness IBM customers demand.&quot;andM;Office Vision is, and will continue to be, available as a host-based systemfor the SAA platforms.andP;  In fact, the early installations are mostly terminalsystems -- not PCs.andP;  &quot;All hosts support your choice of terminals, older, ornewer PCs -- in any combination.andP;  The interfaces depend entirely on yourchoice of workstation.andP;  The system function depends upon your choice of hostand workstation.&quot;andM;It seems more important than the IBM product Office Vision is the IBM officestrategy.andP;  The strategy is to incorporate office processing into businessprocessing until the integration is so complete the distinction disappears.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
