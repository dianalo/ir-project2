Speculation spread after the dollar rallied to nearly 1.85 West German marks last Monday, then got pushed down by selling the next day. Some traders concluded that Tuesday's selling pressure on the dollar came partly from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the West German Bundesbank or possibly both central banks.    But bank dealers who are often knowledgeable about intervention activities said the major central banks weren't in the markets last week. They also said the evidence for formal target zones is circumstantial and unconvincing.    To enforce a strict trading range, central banks &quot;would have to trade actively and wouldn't be able to keep the zone a secret,&quot; Yani M.A. Budiman, vice president, corporate foreign exchange, at Chemical Bank, New York, said. &quot;Until the central banks start trading actively, you can't say there are zones.&quot;    Supporting the rumors is the fact that the dollar hasn't strayed from a relatively narrow range of 1.76 to 1.87 marks since mid-January. That coincides with a period of intensive consultations among finance officials of the Group of Seven nations: the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy. The group agreed in February to act to ensure currency market stability, but the nations deny any target zones have been established.    And when the dollar came under heavy selling pressure this year, the seven nations' central banks spent nearly $40 billion to defend the U.S. currency through market intervention.    &quot;There has to be a rolling target zone,&quot; John D. Hartman, vice president and general manager of foreign exchange at Security Pacific National Bank in New York, said. Such a mechanism would adjust for changes in economic conditions but still maintain exchange-rate limits, he said.    &quot;They definitely want to keep the dollar-mark and dollar-yen (exchange rates) in a fairly thin range,&quot; Mr. Hartman said.    But many other traders take the central banks' stated goal of bringing stability to exchange rates at face value.    &quot;I don't think there were any behind-the-scenes formal agreements on target zones,&quot; David Redding, vice president, money market economics, at Bankers Trust Co., New York, said. &quot;They just want to calm things down.&quot;    As part of that strategy, Mr. Redding said, the central banks probably would rather keep the market guessing about their exact intentions than try to defend specific exchange-rate levels.    &quot;They'd prefer that there be some uncertainty about what the central banks will do,&quot; he said.    Ronald H. Holzer, vice president and chief dealer at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said one of his traders forecast the dollar's latest movements weeks ago, independently of target-zone rumors.    &quot;It makes some sense, but I don't think there's any magic from the central banks,&quot; he said. &quot;The market is conveniently trading within that trading range.&quot;    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar edged lower against most major currencies as traders lacked any impetus to push the U.S. currency out of its narrow range.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8273 West German marks, compared with 1.8300 late Thursday. It was almost unchanged at 146.37 Japanese yen, compared with 146.38. The British pound eased to $1.6120, from $1.6135.    Dealers said the dollar reached its intraday low of 1.8220 marks late in the European day on rumors that U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman-designate Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary James Baker had said the dollar shouldn't rise further. The report was believed to be based on an article in a West German newsletter.    A Treasury spokesman noted that Mr. Baker has repeatedly said a further decline in the dollar &quot;could be counterproductive.&quot; A spokesman at Mr. Greenspan's New York consulting firm said the economist won't comment on such matters until after the confirmation hearings on his nomination to head the Fed.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $6.30 an ounce to $447.10 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $446.05 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                  LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Friday, June 26, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
