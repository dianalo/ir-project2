(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The mother of a blind child who brought ateddy bear stuffed with drug paraphernalia to school pleadedinnocent Thursday to a charge of child endangerment.   Alicia Mae Tapia, 42, was ordered back to San Leandro-HaywardMunicipal Court on May 11 for further proceedings on themisdemeanor charge, the Alameda County District Attorney's officesaid.   Her 8-year-old daughter, blind since birth, brought the teddybear called ``Ticklebear'' to show her classmates at Castro ValleyElementary School. It was part of a school event called ``ShareDay.''   The girl, who attends a class for the visually impaired, toldteacher's aide Diane Oxford that Ticklebear used to laugh whenhugged, but that the battery-operated voice box inside no longerworked, a sheriff's report said.   Oxford told sheriff's deputies she unzipped the brown teddy'sback to see what was wrong, and pulled out a bag with a syringe, abroken plunger, a bottle cap fashioned into a drug cooker, and theresidue of an unknown drug.   The aide took the bear to the principal, who called deputies.   Sheriff's Sgt. Dale Toussaint said the girl told Oxford that theitems belonged to her mother.   The girl and her 6-year-old brother matter-of-factly describedterms used by drug users and how the ``medicine'' is injected inarms, Toussaint said. The boy said both his parents used drugs inthe home, the deputy said.   The children were taken into protective custody and Tapia wasbooked in lieu of $10,000 bail.   Toussaint said a search of the Tapia home produced another teddybear whose zippered compartment contained part of a syringe.   After her arrest she told officers she didn't know the materialswere in the bear, hidden there by her estranged husband. Toussaintquoted the woman as saying she was trying to kick a 25-year habit.</TEXT></DOC>
