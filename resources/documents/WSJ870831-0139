The U.S., which has argued that Israel would be better off buying advanced American fighters, has funded most of the $1.5 billion cost of the seven-year project, the biggest industrial undertaking in Israel's history.    Despite the Israeli military's stance that the Lavi was draining resources from other military research and development, and Israeli Treasury complaints that the country couldn't afford the aircraft, yesterday's cabinet vote was decided on political grounds.    Labor Party leaders, cognizant of U.S. opposition to continuing the Lavi project, were also convinced that continuing it was too much of a strain on Israel's ailing economy. The Likud bloc argued that building the Lavi, instead of relying on purchased U.S. aircraft, would bolster the economy and increase Israel's technological expertise.    The bitterness in the Likud ranks was evident after the vote. Moshe Arens, a Likud minister without portfolio, who was defense minister when the initial decision to build the Lavi was made, said he would resign.    Twelve ministers voted to discontinue the project; 11 voted to keep it. The critical 24th vote was an abstention by the health minister, Shoshana Arbeli-Almoslino, the only woman in the cabinet. She said she was constrained by her Labor colleagues to vote against her &quot;basic judgment&quot; and &quot;conscience.&quot;    Aside from being a bitter blow to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the decision highlights the adroit political maneuvering of his Labor adversary, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. Mr. Peres had previously been among the Lavi's staunchest advocates. But faced with the adamant stance of the military and the Treasury that the project was untenable, and given Washington's opposition, he bowed to the inevitable.    Over the past two weeks he worked out a compromise plan -- which some analysts see less as a viable idea than as a ladder for him to climb down from his previously unqualified support for the Lavi. It entails discontinuing the Lavi's development while minimizing the damage to Israel Aircraft Industries, or IAI, 5,000 of whose 20,000 employees were directly involved in the project.    Mr. Peres proposed that IAI's research and development be redirected toward an even more advanced fighter for the next century, while its production capacity be kept intact by applying to the U.S. for permission to build parts of the F-16 aircraft that Washington has pledged to supply Israel as a substitute for the Lavi. It was the Peres plan that the cabinet endorsed.    Although all ministers stressed that their decision was based solely on Israel's strategic and economic interests, there had been no missing the Reagan administration's overt attempts to sway the decision in favor of ditching the Lavi.    On Saturday night, U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering delivered a fresh message to Mr. Shamir, Mr. Peres and Defense Minister Yitshak Rabin, once more strongly urging termination of the project. The 10-point message was clearly meant to shore up Mr. Peres's contention that the U.S. was committed to helping Israel maintain a high level of technological research and development following the eclipse of the Lavi.    The sweeteners would include, the U.S. confirmed, allowing Israel to spend a greater part of its $1.8 billion annual U.S. military aid package on domestic military projects rather than on purchases in the U.S., and a promise that the new F-16s would be delivered as early as 1991.    But political sources said the U.S. couldn't give an unequivocal commitment to Israeli participation in production of the most-advanced F-16, called the Agile Falcon. Still, the U.S. message reportedly did promise to take into account Israel's &quot;interests&quot; in this regard. Joint production of the F-16, which is made by St. Louis-based General Dynamics Corp., is one of the proposals envisaged in the Peres plan.    The Pentagon issued a statement in Washington saying, &quot;We welcome the Israeli cabinet decision to terminate the Lavi.&quot;    There was no expression of joy from the ministers who brought about the plane's demise. &quot;There is no cause for elation. It was simply a case of bowing to reality. To have gone on with the Lavi would have spelled an end to our economic recovery program,&quot; said Finance Minister Moshe Nissim, the only Likud minister to remain firm in opposing the Lavi.    Military sources described the decision as a triumph that would enable the armed forces to develop other defense projects equally as important as a sophisticated fighter. &quot;The Lavi has been eating up all our research funds,&quot; one of the sources added.    Reaction within IAI was predictably angry. Union members there denounced Labor for &quot;ruining Israel's aeronautics industry.&quot; &quot;The Americans will be able to acquire our know-how for peanuts,&quot; one union official said. Workers said they planned vigorous protests to try to reverse the decision. </TEXT></DOC>
