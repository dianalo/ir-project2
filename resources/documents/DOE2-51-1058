<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-51-1058 </DOCNO><TEXT>Presently available literature (late 1985/early 1986) indicates that significantprogress has been made recently in advancing the state-of- the-art inthe field of optical of information. If this technology could be appliedto the information management task on the Salt Repository Project, severalsignificant advantages are apparent. Among them is the fact that opticalmemory devices have an essentially indefinite storage life. Althoughthe archival and transportability advantages alone would probably justifythe use of this medium, it is also important to investigate its usabilityin the information retrieval mode. It would be of little or no valueto store project data on these disks if recovering the information wasdifficult or inaccurate. As of this date, the project has no way of employingthe tremendous data processing powers of computers for the storage andretrieval of the full text of our document. On a program that is as document-intensiveas the Salt Repository Project, a large percentage of the total person-hoursare spent in either creating or using the project documentation. If sucha capability were available, it is estimated that thousands of person-hourscould be saved in the prelicense and licensing phases of the projectalone, not only for project personnel, but also for monitoring and approvingorganizations such as DOE-HQ, the NRC, Congress, and State agencies.40 refs., 11 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
