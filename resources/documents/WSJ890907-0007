For more than a year, the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office has been investigating certain aspects of the highly profitable stock-loan industry, in which major securities firms such as Shearson lend large blocks of stock to big investors in return for fees. Officials at Shearson, which is 62%-owned by American Express Co., have said they don't believe the firm itself is a target of the inquiry.    Little has been disclosed about the specifics of the investigation. But last summer, a grand jury issued subpoenas requesting records about investments and transactions involving Dennis T. Palmeri, who at the time was Shearson's executive vice president in charge of stock loans. After that disclosure last summer, Shearson confirmed that federal investigators had requested information from the securities firm about its stock-loan business, but said it didn't think &quot;the firm or any of its employees are the target of an investigation.&quot;    Mr. Palmeri resigned voluntarily from Shearson on June 28 after being on a leave of absence since the spring of 1989, a Shearson spokesman said yesterday.    An individual familiar with the case said Mr. Palmeri has already negotiated the terms of his plea agreement. The individual would say only that Mr. Palmeri will plead guilty to charges related to the stock-loan business.    Mr. Palmeri's New Jersey home telephone number is unlisted and he couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Palmeri's attorney, Stanley S. Arkin, said he had no comment.    The U.S. attorney's office declined to comment.    Yesterday afternoon, Shearson released this statement: &quot;The U.S. attorney's office has requested information from Shearson Lehman Hutton relating to a former employee of our stock-loan department and we have been cooperating fully with the request.&quot;    Among his duties while at Shearson, Mr. Palmeri supervised the lending of stock to such large speculators as Ivan F. Boesky. Mr. Boesky cooperated with the government on various investigations of possible securities-law violations after he become embroiled in the Wall Street insider-trading investigation. People familiar with the Palmeri case say it's an offshoot of the Boesky investigation.    Most large brokerage firms have active stock-lending operations. Stocks are generally lent to institutions or individuals who need stock quickly and can't or don't want to purchase enough shares. For example, firms use stock loans when clients want to make so-called short sales -- in which investors borrow stock and sell it, hoping to profit by replacing the stock at a lower price.    While the brokerage firms make big profits on the fees they charge for stock lending, the industry has also been a source of corruption over the years. Prior cases have alleged such actions as improper payments in return for interest-free stock loans, the lending of stock that wasn't eligible for lending, and creation of phony transactions.    Over the years, the federal government has brought various criminal and civil cases involving allegedly improper stock-loan activities. In 1987, Shearson, which has one of the major stock-loan operations on Wall Street, was censured by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC alleged in a civil case that Shearson &quot;unlawfully used customers' securities&quot; for stock loans in November 1985, with the largest improper use of customers' securities occurring on Nov. 4, 1985, when the company used about $69 million of such securities for illegal stock loans.    Shearson said the alleged violations were &quot;technical in nature&quot; and that no customers were harmed. The firm, which neither admitted nor denied the SEC allegations, agreed to make changes in its internal procedures. </TEXT></DOC>
