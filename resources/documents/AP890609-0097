The increase in the Labor Department's Producer Price Indexprimarily reflected higher prices for cars, fresh vegetables andgasoline.   For the first five months of the year, wholesale inflation forgoods one stop short of the retail level was running at a 9.4percent annual rate, more than double the 4 percent rise in 1988 andquadruple the 2.2 percent 1987 gain.   The index troubled economists earlier this year, when it soared1.1 percent in January and 0.9 percent in February. But moderaterises of 0.4 percent in both March and April had been seen as a signthat inflation had retreated at least a bit.   In advance of today's report, many economists were predicting amoderate-to-brisk 0.5 percent gain.   Financial markets, which have been rallying in recent weeks onevidence that the overheated economy is cooling enough to producemilder price pressures, turned down modestly in early trading today.The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dipped about 1{ pointsin the first hour of trading.   Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser,attributed most of the inflation so far this year to the ``specialfactors'' of energy and food and predicted better numbers ahead.   ``We want to remain vigilant against inflation. We expectinflation to stabilize in the second half of the year and declinethereafter,'' Boskin told reporters at a White House briefing.   Energy prices in May rose 3.3 percent, a steep increase but lessthan half April's 30-month record of 7.2 percent. For the past sixmonths, energy prices have surged at a 43.3 percent annual rate.   In May, the increase was propelled by a 5.2 percent jump ingasoline prices, which followed a 13.4 percent jump in April.Natural gas prices rose 3.4 percent, while heating oil costsdeclined 7.7 percent.   Food prices, which had posted a rare 0.6 percent decline inApril, rebounded 0.8 percent in May. The price of vegetablesskyrocketed 26.4 percent as celery and tomato prices doubled andcabbage prices rose by one-third.   There were also significant increases for eggs, rice, pasta andchicken. Prices for beef, pork and fish declined.   For the past six months, food prices have risen at an annual rateof 7.3 percent. But analysts expect that trend to moderate, barringa repeat of last year's drought.   The price of goods excluding the volatile food and energysectors, often taken by analysts as a truer reflection of underlyinginflationary pressures, rose 0.5 percent last month following anunusual 0.1 percent decline in April.   The increase in May was largely driven by a 1.8 percent reboundin auto prices following a 2.8 percent decline a month earlier.   The April drop was produced by manufacturers' incentives tobolster sagging sales, while a Labor Department analyst said therebound was driven by price increases fnd 0.9 percent in February.But moderate rises of 0.4 percent in both March and April had beenseen as a sign that inflation had retreated at least a bit.

Traders in financial markets were looking to today's report toprovide an indication of how far and how fast the Federal ReserveBoard will lower interest rates.   Earlier this week, the Fed nudged the key federal funds rate _the interest charged banks for overnight loans _ down by one-quarterof a percentage point to near 8{ percent.   Stock and bond markets rallied in response, taking the change asevidence the central bank has decided to end its 15-month campaignof fighting inflation with higher interest rates.   Michael K. Evans, president of Evans Economics Inc. inWashington, said today's report means the Fed likely will wait atleast a month before loosening credit further.   ``I don't think there's going to be any further easing by the Feduntil we ... get some good inflation numbers for more than one monthat a time,'' he said.   Still, analysts were optimistic that inflation reports eventuallywould improve. Economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia StateUniversity said he believed gasoline prices have now more thanreflected the run-up in crude oil prices this spring and willstabilize.   His view is bolstered by the deal struck Wednesday by theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which set a highertarget for crude oil production.</TEXT></DOC>
