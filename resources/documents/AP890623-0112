Chris George, co-director of the U.S.-headquartered Save theChildren Federation, told reporters he was treated well during his30-hour captivity.   ``They were nice to me,'' said George, 35, of Montclair, N.J. ``Ipracticed my Arabic during this period.''   George, who was kidnapped Thursday in Gaza City, showed reportersa six-page letter he said the kidnappers asked him to deliver toPresident Bush. The letter requested that Bush meet with PLO leaderYasser Arafat.   The letter also said the kidnapping was not intended to hurtAmericans but was a plea for people across the world, especially theUnited States, to understand the plight of the Palestinians andtheir need for independence.   George was released at the U.N. hostel on the beach in Gaza City,then taken to the Marne House hotel by about 10 Americans from theU.S. Embassy.   He walked into the Marne House hotel at about 6 p.m. (11 a.m.EDT) and shook hands with hotel workers and Palestinian journalists.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Len Lefko said he was ``not aware of anyconditions'' for the release.   He said George had spoken with U.S. Ambassador William Brown.``His condition is good ... he told the ambassador he was well andhappy and delighted,'' Lefko said.   Earlier today, the army blamed his abduction on Palestinianterrorists linked to the PLO. Palestinian accounts said the hostagesent letters demanding jailed Palestinian prisoners be set free.   In Tunis, the PLO denounced the kidnapping and a spokesman saidit was making the ``greatest effort'' to obtain the hostage'srelease. It was unclear immediately what role, if any, the PLOplayed in George's release.   He was the first foreigner to be kidnapped in the occupied lands,said Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel.   State Department sources in Washington said George was releasedinto the custody of the Red Crescent, the Arab Red Cross. Theofficials, who demanded anonymity, said it was not known whokidnapped George.   During the 18-month uprising against Israeli occupation, thePLO-backed underground in the occupied lands has maintained a policyopposing the use of arms and exempting foreigners from attacks. Thekidnapping would mark a change of strategy if it was sanctioned bythe leadership. More than 500 Palestinians and 23 Isrealis have beenkilled in the uprising.   After the abduction, the army set up checkpoints and stopped carsdriven by Palestinians in Gaza City, a city of 150,000. Soldiersconducted searches and declared the 140-square-mile Gaza Strip aclosed military area, barring journalists from entering.   PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdul-Rahman said in a telephone interviewfrom Tunisia that the PLO had nothing to do with the abduction and``denounced completely and thoroughly this capture of an Americancitizen who works to help Palestinian children.''   Khatem Abu Shaaban, a Palestinian official of Save the Children,said the agency's office in Gaza received a letter written by Georgethat was relayed via the Red Cross.   ``It said that Chris George was kidnapped by five people, andthat they have certain demands,'' Abu Shaaban said in an interview.   Abu Shaaban said George and Tony Charter, the director of Savethe Children in Gaza, were alone in the Gaza City office on Omarel-Mukhtar street around noon Thursday when a Palestinian whomGeorge knew entered.   ``The man said he wanted Chris to walk out of the office so thatthey can discuss an important subject,'' Abu Shaaban said. ``Chrisnever came back.''   The Israeli news agency Itim reported George knew the man wellenough to hug and kiss him.   A Palestinian journalist who spoke on condition of anonymity saida Red Cross worker showed him one of two letters written in Englishby George.   ``After 20 hours I write my second letter to the Americanambassador and George Bush and his administration, the friends ofthe Israeli government, in order to obtain my freedom,'' he quotedthe letter as saying.   The letter, received by Save the Children today, said George wasabducted by five men armed with a machine gun and four grenades.   It said the captors demanded the release of seven seniorPalestinian activists held in Israeli jails, including Sheikh AhmedYassin, the wheelchair-bound spiritual leader of the Hamasfundamentalist movement, which does not belong to the PLO; MutawakilTaha, a member of Yasser Arafat's Fatah organization and the head ofthe Arab Writers Union, who is held without trial undeadministrative detention; and members of two PLO factions, theSyrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine andpro-communist Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.   In addition, the letter said Israel should stop deportingPalestinian activists and investigate the death of Omar Al Qassem, asenior figure of the Democratic Front for the Liberation ofPalestine.   Arab activists and Israeli officials said Qassem died of cancerthis month.   Save the Children is a private international development andrelief organization with more than 3,000 employees in 40 countries.   George lives with his wife and their two daughters outside theWest Bank town of Ramallah.   George worked in Oman with the Peace Corps and in a Palestinianrefugee camp in Lebanon with Save the Children before moving toIsrael. He left Lebanon after kidnappings by Moslem radicals theremade it dangerous for Westerners.</TEXT></DOC>
