The East bloc failed to provide figures for Central Europe, anarea where most of the deadly weaponry of both military blocs ismassed. But Bulgarian Ambassador Lyuben Petrov, speaking for theWarsaw Pact, told a news conference figures for a Central Europeanzone would be presented ``in the near future.''   On Tuesday, East bloc proposed at the conventional arms talksthat no nation, including the Soviet Union and the United States,be allowed to have more than 35 to 40 percent of the combinedmanpower totals of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.   The moves meet U.S. demands aimed at reducing a large WarsawPact edge over the North Atlantic Treaty Organization innon-nuclear strength. As one example, Soviet tanks now account fornearly 70 percent of all NATO and Warsaw Pact armor combined.   Petrov said that in ``strips of contact'' _ or front-line areas_ of the 16-member NATO alliance and the seven-nation Warsaw Pact,manpower for each side should not exceed 1 million; strike aircraftshould be limited to 1,100; combat helicopters to 1,300; tanks to16,000; artillery pieces to 16,500, and armored troop carriers to20,500.   These strips of contact for the Warsaw Pact would cover theLeningrad and Baltic military districts; Poland; East Germany;Czechoslovakia; Hungary; Romania; Bulgaria; and three othermilitary districts in the Soviet Union, including Odessa on theBlack Sea.   For the Western alliance, they include Norway, Denmark, Belgium,the Netherlands, Luxembourg, West Germany, Italy, Greece and Turkey.   The new East bloc figures are lower than figures proposedearlier. Those were: 1,350,000 manpower; 1,500 strike aircraft;1,700 combat helicopters; 20,000 tanks; 24,000 artillery pieces,and 28,000 armored troop carriers.   The Warsaw Pact also presented figures for the six categories inwhat the Soviet alliance called rear areas. On the East's side,these comprise the Byelorussian, Carpathian, Kiev, Moscow, Volgaand Urals military districts. For NATO the rear areas are Iceland,Britain, France, Spain and Portugal.   Chief U.S. negotiator Stephen J. Ledogar told reporters at thenews briefing the figures were ``proof of another positivedevelopment and ... we treat and accept (them) seriously.''   ``We welcome this further elaboration of the East proposals,(and) we welcome in particular the fact that the (Soviet bloc)seems to be following the blueprint which the West laid down onMarch 9.''   The complex negotiations on conventional armed forces in Europeopened in March.   NATO proposed at that time a limit of 12,000 tanks, 10,000artillery pieces and 16,800 armored troop carriers for any onenation.   It wants weaponry stationed outside one's home country limitedto 3,200 tanks, 1,700 artillery pieces and 6,000 armored troopcarriers in each bloc.   ``The Eastern numbers are on a number of cases significantlyhigher than ours,'' Ledogar said. ``Careful study and detaileddiscussion with the Eastern representatives will be necessarybefore we can assess the extent to which the latest Easternproposals might contribute to our common task.''   Differences persist. Petrov chided NATO for identifying onlythree types of arms.   The East would like to see attack combat aircraft andhelicopters included in a first phase agreement. The West said ithad not excluded aircraft from negotiations, but felt the best wayto start a phase one agreement was to concentrate on tanks, armoredpersonnel carriers and artillery.</TEXT></DOC>
