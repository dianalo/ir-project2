The theory allows for compressibility and thermalexpansion of both the pore water and the salt. The elements of the theoryinclude mass and momentum balances for the fluid, momentum and energybalances for the fluid-solid mixture, and a compatibility equation. Themodel has been applied to one stage of the Salt Block II experiment.In this experiment, the fluid flux into a heated borehole in a largecylinder of salt was measured over time. The success of the model suggeststhat, at least under the special conditions of the first stage of theSalt Block II experiment, the water collected was intergranular (pore)water that moved by Darcian flow. Appendix contains seven vugraphs.</TEXT></DOC>
