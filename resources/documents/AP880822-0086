Under the late leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, awards were given out``by the scores and even by hundreds'' to people who had fulfilledthe government's five-year production plans, the official newsagency Tass said Monday.   People have stopped appreciating awards because ``they weregiven out with a bountiful hand in the Brezhnev period on theoccasion of birthdays and red-letter dates,'' Tass said.   ``The real contribution of the person awarded was not duly takeninto account,'' Tass said.   The Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee andPresidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament, hasadopted new rules on medals to make sure they are given to peoplewho truly deserve them, the news agency said.   The image of Brezhnev himself is one of a man with a full chestof medals, and the Soviet press has recently lampooned him for this.   The overhaul of the award system is another element of Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive to hold public officials moreaccountable for their work and to end blind praise for them. Italso is another step in moving away from the policies of Brezhnev,now condemned widely for plaguing the country with cronyism,corruption and economic stagnation.   To improve the system, decisions on recipients won't be made bya small number of high-ranking officials in private, but by allwork collectives and public organizations, the news agency said.   Awards will no longer be made en masse or for reaching a jubileein a citizen's career.   The country's highest honors, including the title Hero of theSoviet Union and Hero of Socialist Labor, won't be given more thanonce to the same person, as has happened in the past. Eligibilityrequirements have been tightened for the top decorations, the Orderof Lenin and Order of the October Revolution, Tass said withoutelaborating.   But while many of the changes appear aimed cutting the number ofawards given, Tass said new honorary titles were being created forteachers, physicians and agricultural workers. Gorbachev'sadministration has placed particular emphasis on improving theseprofessions.   The article gave no figures for the number of awards given inthe past or what the number will be under the new rules.</TEXT></DOC>
