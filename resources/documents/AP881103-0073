(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Pennsylvania couple who claim they losttheir daughter in a hospital baby-swap 10 years ago now say theywon't necessarily seek custody of the Florida girl they believe istheirs, their lawyer says.   In an amended lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court, Ernest andRegina Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., said they still want a judge toorder a genetic test to determine the biological parents of9-year-old Kimberly Mays of Sarasota.   The suit omits a previous contention that the child lacks astable home life. The girl lives with her father, Robert W. Mays.Her mother is dead.   Because of the amended lawsuit, a hearing set for Friday on theoriginal request for a blood sample from the girl was postponed. Nonew date was set.   The amended suit will streamline the proceedings, according toJohn Blakely and William Post, attorneys for the Twiggs.   ``We did not make any allegations that we felt were unnecessary''for the judge to decide whether or not to order the genetic test,Blakely said.   The original suit, filed in October, said the Twiggs would seekcustody of Kimberly if she proved to be their biological daughter.   But Blakely said Wednesday that the Twiggs want to find the girlfirst and then investigate her lifestyle before deciding, on thebasis of what they believe is the child's best interest, whether toseek custody.   Mays last month insisted he is Kimberly's real father and willnot give up the child under any circumstances.   The Twiggs filed a $100 million federal lawsuit in Septemberagainst Hardee Memorial Hospital, three doctors and a nurse,alleging their healthy daughter was switched shortly after birthwith a child with a heart defect.   The child raised by the Twiggs, named Arlena, died in August. Agenetic test conducted in the summer proved she was unrelated toeither Twigg.</TEXT></DOC>
