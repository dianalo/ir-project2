Frankly, I don't know what country they'retalking about,'' said James Miller, head of the Reaganadministration's Office of Management and Budget. ``It seems to methey're either deceiving the American people or they're in theTwilight Zone somewhere.''   ``The Democratic Party is pulling together to help perpetuatethe fraud,'' said South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell.   ``That's the traditional philosophy,'' said New Hampshire Gov.John Sununu. ``It is the tax and spend wing that is in control.They have written a platform that attempts to hide that.''   On the day the convention took up the platform, a GOP ``truthsquad'' took aim at the document, arguing that it demonstrates thatcertain nominee Michael Dukakis is cast in the traditional liberalmold.   ``They can hide from the `L' word all they want,'' Campbellsaid. ``It's a fact of life. There is a fraud being perpetuated onthe American public.''   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., said Republicans must make it clearthat Dukakis is cut from the liberal mold, despite his efforts tododge the label.   ``His history has been a history of public service that involvestax and spend,'' Lewis said. ``The Democratic Party intends to be aparty without principle practicing the politics of deception.''   Miller argued that while Democrats are trying to soft-pedal thequestion of tax increases, they would be inevitable in a Democraticadministration.   ``I know you can't do all those things the Democrats here inAtlanta are talking about without raising taxes,'' Miller said. ``Ithink somebody ought to make that point and I think the Democratsought to be held accountable for it.''   Rep. Don Sundquist, R-Tenn., attacked House Speaker Jim Wright,who chairs the Democratic convention and is under investigation forallegations involving a book written by a staffer.   ``I think it's devastating to have Jim Wright on the platform,''Sundquist said. ``I think if they had any way to get him off theplatform without embarrassing him they would.''   The GOP squad tried to turn the selection of conservative TexasSen. Lloyd Bentsen for the No. 2 spot on the ticket to Republicanadvantage, suggesting there's a philosophical split and rememberingearlier Bentsen criticisms of ``ultraliberals.''</TEXT></DOC>
