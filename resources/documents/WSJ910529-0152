Which has been the betterinvestment over the past five years: Treasuries or junkbonds?   Sounds easy. Government bonds are the very definition of ariskless investment. While never breathtaking, the returnsare a safe bet. In contrast, junk bonds -- well, everyoneknows the troubles with junk bonds. But the answer, accordingto a recent Merrill Lynch bond index:</LP><TEXT>   Returns from short-term Treasuries over the past fiveyears: 8.273%. Junk bonds over the past five years: 8.277%.   Extra bonus if you also knew that the recent turnaround injunk bonds makes them the best-performing fixed-income mutualfunds. According to Lipper Analytical Services, junk-bondfunds have had an average return this year of nearly 17%.   Accepted wisdom never made anyone wealthy, but how couldwhat everyone knows be so wrong? {See nearby lettersresponding even to Nobel Prize winner Harry Markowitz (see:&quot;Letters to the Editor: A Lot of Rubbish About Junk Bonds&quot; --WSJ May 29, 1991).} True, several junk-bond deals have gonebad. But the reason higher-risk bonds pay higher rates ofreturn is because of the higher rate of default. Somethingelse is going on.   One better explanation is how high-profile prosecutorialand regulatory attacks turned junk bonds into the TyphoidMary of financial instruments. One of the best examples isthe lawsuit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. andResolution Trust Corp. filed in January against seven pages'worth of defendants, including Michael Milken and hispartnerships. The lawsuit seeks $12 billion in damages withthe claim that the junk-bond market is a fraudulent miragethat lured investments from thrifts now seized by federalregulators.   &quot;The Milken Group chose a deceptive euphemism -- `highyield' -- to describe these high-risk junk securities,&quot;according to the lawsuit. The government claims thedefendants then conned savings and loans into investing injunk bonds as a way to &quot;spread their gospel of greed to otherpredators and would-be predators.&quot;   If this language sounds lurid, the details of thegovernment claims are surprisingly light on specifics toestablish violations of everything from antitrust laws andRICO to the Arizona Consumer Fraud Statute. According to thesuit, Drexel Burnham Lambert &quot;willfully, deliberately andsystematically plundered certain Sandamp;Ls,&quot; as part of a schemeto &quot;unlawfully inflate the value of junk bonds and to createthe illusion that such inflated value could be realized in aliquid market.&quot; At the same time, &quot;this group of predatorsknowingly conspired to, attempted to and did monopolize thenationwide junk bond markets.&quot;   The FDIC/RTC lawsuit ignores the years federal prosecutorsspent poring over trading records without proving any suchcharges. Mr. Milken's plea bargain didn't include any countsalleging some broad fraud in the junk-bond market. Thelawsuit also ignores that thrift investments in junk bondsaccount for a small fraction of both the junk-bond market andSandamp;L losses, which are largely from bad real-estate loans.Still, if this case actually goes to trial a jury will get achance to sort out real villains from politically convenientphantoms.   A 21-page legal memorandum now circulating among thedozens of lawyers for the defendants outlines the other sideof the case. Prepared by the firm of Donovan Leisure Newton andamp;Irvine, the memo says that &quot;the FDIC/RTC case has theearmarks of a transparent effort to deflect blame frommisguided legislation and regulatory policies that at bottomare the cause of the national Sandamp;L debacle.&quot; The memodismisses the &quot;inherent absurdity&quot; of the allegation thatDrexel misled the thrifts about the risks of junk bonds orthat troubles in the junk-bond market explain the thriftcrisis.   For one thing, despite the government's claim that Drexel&quot;rigged&quot; the junk-bond market, some 100 other firms haveunderwritten junk bonds. There have been about 1,000junk-bond issues where Drexel was not involved. Indeed, it isan irony that the best-known deals to go bad, such as Revcoand Allied-Campeau, were underwritten by Drexel competitors.   It's also hard to believe that the thrifts that investedin junk bonds had the sophistication level of widows andorphans. &quot;The FDIC/RTC case posits that multi-billion dollarSandamp;Ls, with their teams of professional analysts, creditofficers, outside money managers and investment committees,&quot;the defendants' memo says, &quot;were duped into believing thathigh-yield securities were essentially risk-free.&quot;   There are serious questions about which investments areproper for institutions subsidized by federal depositguarantees. Still, it's legally relevant that regulatorsencouraged thrifts to invest in junk bonds. A GeneralAccounting Office study in 1989 found that junk bonds wereamong the best investments thrifts were allowed to make.Still, the FDIC/RTC lawsuit excludes from its calculation ofsupposed Sandamp;L losses the profits thrifts made from tradingjunk bonds and collecting the interest.   The defendants' memo also makes a point that highlightsthe troubling spectacle of government agencies makingkitchen-sink style legal allegations. Junk-bond issuesroutinely include detailed &quot;risk factors&quot; explaining thedangers that justified the higher interest payments. Thismeans scores of lawyers performed legally required &quot;duediligence&quot; before these bonds went to market.   Some of these deals involved the law firm the FDIC/RTChired to sue Mr. Milken, the high-powered New York firm ofCravath, Swaine andamp; Moore, which represents the government on amodified contingency-fee basis. The defendants' lawyers notedthat &quot;Certain of these Wall Street houses were represented bythe same lawyers representing the FDIC/RTC in the litigation,Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore, who presumably reviewed and approvedtheir own clients' prospectuses containing language similarto that they now find objectionable in Drexel's documents.&quot;   If this case ever goes to a jury, the defendants will tryto explain the real reasons several thrifts have had problemswith their junk bonds. The memo cites the 1989 Sandamp;L bailoutbill, which required thrifts to mark their junk bonds tomarket. This and the requirement that thrifts sell theirbonds within a few years depressed the market, makinginsolvent the few thrifts with large junk-bond holdings, suchas Columbia Savings andamp; Loan.   Volatility in markets is nothing new -- and certainly notprima facie proof of fraud. The defendants' memo notes, forexample, that IBM's market value fell by $6 billion in oneday of recent trading. The important but unanswered questionis how much of the volatility in junk bonds comes fromgovernment overreaction.   Lawsuits can occasionally shed light on complex issues,especially when the issues have become politicized. Jurorssomeday could be asked which caused the Sandamp;L crisis:Government regulations or a financial instrument? The answermay not make the plaintiff here -- the government -- veryhappy.</TEXT></DOC>
