The adsorptionof iodine from aqueous KI solution at 25/sup 0/C, nitrogen at -196/sup0/C and carbon dioxide at 25/sup 0/C were carried out. The results revealedthat {gamma}-irradiation up to 35 Mrad did not lead to any detectablechange in the adsorption behaviour of the adsorbates investigated. However,irradiation at higher doses viz. 80 and 100 Mrad resulted in a significantincrease in pore size as determined from carbon dioxide adsorption isothermsto an extent proportional to the dose employed. This increase might beattributed to a possible radiolytic decomposition of oxygen complexeslocated on the surfaces of stream-activated carbons. Observable changewas also found in the shape of iodine isotherms. However, a single nitrogenisotherm was measured for both the unirradiated and all irradiated carbons.</TEXT></DOC>
