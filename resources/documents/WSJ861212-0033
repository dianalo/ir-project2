Toshio Takai, president of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan, told a news conference here that the manufacturers also oppose any legislation that would restrict home taping by owners of the new equipment, known as digital audio tape recorders.    The recorders, which have been developed, but not yet marketed, by major Japanese manufacturers, are considered a copyright threat because of their high quality and high-speed reproduction capability. The Japanese association announced its position after a meeting here on copyright issues with U.S. and European music recording company representatives.    Nesuhi Ertegun, a spokesman for the music recording companies, said they will seek legislative initiatives in the U.S. and the Common Market to require that the new tape recorders be equipped with copyright protection devices.    The meeting, which took place in Vancouver because it represented a neutral site, was attended by senior executives of Sony Corp., Toshiba Corp., Hitachi Sales Corp. and other Japanese makers of electronic hardware. These companies are believed to be ready to introduce the new tape equipment early next year at prices in the $1,300 range.    The music recording industry represented by the Recording Industry Association of America and the International Federation of Phonogram and Videogram Producers requested a conference several weeks ago in an effort to obtain the Japanese industry's support for copyright protection. </TEXT></DOC>
