HIGGINS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary of State James A. Baker III saidWednesday further sanctions against South Africa would beinappropriate now because of steps the country's new government istaking toward the black majority.   Baker said he refused to ``choose sides'' in the Commonwealthdispute in which British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refusedto go along with a call by other Commonwealth leaders for furthersanctions.   Instead, he reiterated that the United States is committed toending apartheid by assisting blacks in South Africa economicallyand politically and would work through diplomcy to resolveconflicts.   ``We're going to continue to work with our allies to supportchange in South Africa, and we're going to try and continue to workwith (the U.S.) Congress to develop a bipartisan approach,'' Bakersaid.   He said action taken by President F.W. de Klerk and hisgovernment in recent weeks ``is clearly a step in the rightdirection, and I think that that step argues for continued patiencewith respect to the question of further sanctions.''   ``I think it would be inappropriate now to move forward withfurther sanctions in the light of the efforts of that newgovernment _ obvious efforts of that new government to move in theright direction,'' Baker said.   Baker didn't refer specifically to steps taken by the de Klerkgovernment such as freeing of imprisoned black leaders andpermitting anti-apartheid demonstrating.   The United States has said since September that it doesn't thinksanctions should be increased now but that it might re-evaluate itsposition if negotiations between the South African government andblacks fail to achieve progress by next summer.</TEXT></DOC>
