Gray merits attention.andP;  It not only defines thelegal issues a reviewing court would have to deal with in this particularlawsuit, but also spotlights the questions that are likely to be of concernto the judiciary in its future dealings with complicated copyrightcontroversies arising in the computing industry.andM;For those readers who may have been sojourning on Mars, here, briefly, arethe facts that led to the trial court decision.andP;  Starting in about 1979,Intel began granting licenses to other companies for the manufacture and saleof its 8086 and 8088 microprocessors.andP;  These chips contained Intel'smicrocode, a set of basic instructions that govern the operation of acomputer's circuitry.andP;  Intel's early licensing agreements required thatlicensees place copyright notices on their products if Intel requested themto do so--though no such request was actually made until 1985.andM;Licenses for Intel's 8086 and 8088 microprocessors issued to Fujitsu, NEC,and Mitsubishi between 1981 and 1984, in contrast to the earlier ones,contained no mention whatsoever of any obligation to affix a copyrightnotice.andP;  In mid-1984, NEC introduced its V20 and V30 microprocessors, whichcontained microcode that Intel would later claim infringed its copyrights onits 8086 and 8088 microcode.andP;  In September of that year, Intel's generalcounsel for the first time made inquiry of NEC as to whether it was placingnotice of Intel's copyright on its licensed products.andP;  (It was not, as itturned out.)andP;  Then, in December, NEC filed the present lawsuit, seeking toobtain a ruling either that Intel's copyrights were invalid or, if not, thatNEC's V20 and V30 microcode did not infringe on Intel's copyrights.andP;  A coupleof months later, Intel countersued, claiming NEC had infringed itscopyrights, and the battle was joined.andM;All that took place four years ago.andP;  But let me assure you that in thisinstance blame for the delay can't be laid at the door of the present judge.andO;A different judge had been assigned to resolve the controversy initially, andhad gotten so far as to issue a preliminary ruling that microcode iscopyrightable--a decision that was greeted with enthusiasm both by the USchip industry and Wall Street.andP;  That decision went out the window, though,when the first judge decided to disqualify himself, after NEC challenged hisfitness on the grounds that he indirectly owned roughly $80 worth of Intelstock.andP;  As a result, the litigation had to be started over from square onebefore Judge Gray in March 1988.andM;Judge Gray's analysis of the controversy is interesting from several pointsof view.andP;  The most obvious one--the one that's attracted the most attentionin the press--is his ruling that microcode does come within the area ofprotected expression defined by US copyright law.andP;  In large part because ofthe way the copyright statutes have been written, there had been confusion onthis point, despite the fact that it's generally conceded that software canbe copyrighted.andM;When the copyright law currently in force was passed in 1976, it contained nomention of computer programs in its list of categories of copyrightable worksof authorship, even though the act specifically referred to such things asmusical works, pantomimes, sound recordings, and motion pictures &quot;and otheraudiovisual works&quot;.andP;  Congress endeavored to repair this omission when itenacted the Software Act of 1980, which contained the following definition:andM;A &quot;computer program&quot; is a set of statements or instructions to be useddirectly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certainresult.andM;NEC argued that microcode doesn't fit this definition, since it is not meantto be used &quot;in&quot; a computer, but is instead a defining element of the computeritself.andP;  The judge did not buy this &quot;semi-semantical&quot; argument, citinglanguage in the landmark case of Apple vs.andP;  Franklin (see &quot;Rules of theGame&quot;, UNIX REVIEW, July 1984) to the effect that the copyright statute doesnot suggest there should be different treatment for computer programs &quot;basedupon the functions they serve within the machine&quot;.andM;NEC also attacked Intel's microcode's copyrightability on the grounds thatthe element of originality demanded by copyright law was lacking.andP;  It pointedout that several of the microsequences in the Intel microcode were veryshort, involving only a few steps, and that they have been handled almostidentically in other microcodes.andP;  As to this point, Judge Gray observed:andM;It well may be that, considered alone, several of the microsequences inIntel's microcode consist of &quot;forms of expression directed solely byfunctional considerations&quot; lacking even &quot;minimal creativity.&quot;andP;  But theseexamples are only small segments of the copyrighted microcode.andP;  As Intelpoints out, any copyrighted work, be it a poem, novel or computer program,can be chopped into parts that could be said to have very few creative steps.andO;.  .  .  There is no evidence that Intel's microcode was other than anindependent effort and, overall, Intel's microcode exceeds the requiredmodicum of originality.andM;On the basis of these rulings--which prompted one observer to comment that&quot;copyright law is not going to go much further than this&quot;--Intel claimedvictory.andP;  Understandably, however, the company has been less enthusiasticwith respect to two other key findings announced by Judge Gray: first, thatIntel had forfeited its copyright protection on the 8068/88 chips by failingto ensure that they bore the required copyright notice, and, second, thatNEC's V-series microprocessors do not, in fact, infringe upon Intel'scopyrights.andM;In arriving at the first of these determinations, the judge had no need toblaze new legal trails.andP;  The present copyright law, while more lenient inthis regard than its predecessor, explicitly requires that the legallyspecified copyright notice &quot;be placed on all publicly distributed copies&quot; ofa copyrighted work.andP;  Intel had let nearly three million copies of itsmicrocode--over ten percent of the total--be distributed without anycopyright notice.andP;  Judge Gray determined this to be more than the &quot;relativelysmall number&quot; that the law forgives.andM;Even so, Intel could have remedied the situation by making &quot;a reasonableeffort&quot; to add the notice to existing chips, but in the judge's view failedto do so.andP;  For instance, the company waited eight months from the date itclaims to have discovered the omission before it sent stickers to one of itslicensees with the request that they be transmitted to its US distributorsand placed on the chips.andP;  The judge commented:andM;The affixing of stickers is a laborious and time-consuming task that a personwould be reluctant to perform without compensation, and Intel never offeredto help defray the cost.andP;  .  .  .  Further, Intel never made a follow-upinquiry to learn if FMI had delivered the stickers as requested, and we arenot aware of any stickers ever having been used by the distributors.andM;Small wonder that one commentator called this &quot;an expensive lesson incopyright law&quot; for Intel.andM;In arriving at his other key finding--that NEC's V-series microcode does not,in fact, constitute an infringement of Intel's code--the judge was obliged toexplore notably more novel considerations, and these have implications thatextend far beyond disputes regarding microcode.andM;It was undisputed that NEC had access to Intel's microcode, and though noneof the approximately 90 microroutines in NEC's code was identical to Intel's,as the judge noted, some of the short ones were substantially similar.andO;Nevertheless, Judge Gray concluded that an ordinary observer would notrecognize NEC's microcode as having been taken from Intel's.andP;  He then turnedto the question of whether the evidence showed actual copying on the part ofNEC.andM;Among the Intel contentions rejected was one with broad implications for thesoftware industry: Intel claimed that circumstances indicated that NEC'sprogrammer, one Mr. Kaneko, must have copied Intel's code, because he wasrelatively inexperienced with microprograms, he was working under an&quot;arduous&quot; time schedule, and he made relatively few notes as compared to thenumber he made in his work on other programs.andP;  In his testimony, Kanekocountered each of these contentions, and the judge concluded as follows(emphasis mine):andM;Mr.andP;  Kaneko testified in a straightforward manner and displayed considerabletechnical knowledge in explaining the decisions that he made in the creationof the V20/V30 microcode.andP;  He did not contend that he had not been influencedby his experience in previously having disassembled the 8086/88 microcode.andO;Such experience inevitably became part of his expertise, and the acquiredknowledge of how Mr. McKevitt created instructions to be executed by the8086/88 microcode very well may have been a source of ideas that Mr. Kanekoutilized in preparing a microcode for the V20/V30.andP;  However, he testifiedcreditably that he did not undertake to copy the 8068/88 microcode, and .andP;  . andO;.  the other evidence .andP;  .  .  by no means impels a contrary conclusion.andM;Readers who are contemplating changing jobs, or who are in the process ofstarting up a new company, will take heart upon reading such language.andP;  Toput the judge's conclusion another way, the &quot;expertise&quot; individuals derivefrom intimate knowledge of a company's proprietary information, assuming itwas legitimately come by, won't necessarily bar them from working in thefuture on similar--but competitive--projects.andP;  And after all, isn't this justanother way of saying that a company can't own a person's mind?andM;Still, it may well be that the most significant aspect of Judge Gray'sdecision is its explicit application of a well-established rule in literarycopyright cases to controversies involving claims that computer programs havebeen copied: &quot;Copying [that is] deleted or so disguised as to beunrecognizable is not copying&quot;, so &quot;a defendant may legitimately avoidinfringement by intentionally making sufficient changes in a work which wouldotherwise be regarded as substantially similar to that of the plaintiffs&quot;.andO;(I can think of some well-publicized pending lawsuits in which the plaintiffswill not warm to Judge Gray's observations in this regard.)andM;As I've mentioned, by the time you read this we may know whether the presentdecision in NEC vs.andP;  Intel is destined to be supplanted by one from anappellate court, or instead will remain the last word in this particularcontroversy.andP;  If the latter should turn out to be the case, bear in mind thata decision by a federal district judge won't be binding on another courthearing a different lawsuit.andP;  However, assuming people in the legal communitylike the reasoning it contains, a trial court decision can be highlypersuasive as a precedent.andP;  Only time will tell.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
