The following article, asneak preview of the computers of the coming decade, is one of aperiodic series, ``The '90s,'' looking ahead to the promise andperil of the upcoming decade, in the environment, medicine,technology and society.</TEXT><BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Imagine what would happen if thousands of brightbut bored Nintendo fanatics, Walkman freaks and TV channel flipperswent to college and studied computer science.   What would happen is the personal computer of the 1990s _ ablend of 3-D television and quadraphonic stereo with the handcontrols of a video game machine and more speed than car-sizedmainframes of the 1980s.   Silicon chips burning through a billion instructions a secondwill be able to surround the user with the sights and sounds of anearly morning in Paris or an erupting Hawaiian volcano.   ``Multimedia'' computers will rival television for attention ona Tuesday night. More importantly, experts say, they will helpeducate the next generation of video-hungry schoolchildren.   A computer is the most patient teacher, which is why manystudents blossom when they practice math or spelling on it.Computers of the '90s will simulate a four-lane highway fordriver's ed or a flask of hydrochloric acid for chemistry.   ``You could have a tremendous explosion of human knowledge overthe next decade. This could not only accelerate people's learningprocess but make a boatload of money,'' said William Zachmann,president of Canopus Research in Duxbury, Mass.   ``Infotainment'' and other trends in computers are beingpropelled by a ceaseless decline in the price of computing power, adecline that opens up previously unimaginable possibilities.   Cheaper chips will add smarts to things people use every day,from toasters to the telephone system. They will become so commonthat people will stop remarking on them, the way people stoppedtalking about ``transistor'' radios once all radios had transistors.   In contrast to electricity, which is a powerful force of nature,computing is an abstraction. No one ever was killed on a golfcourse by a bolt of computing. But computers add capability tomachinery, and in the 1990s they will extend the human reach inevery field from weather forecasting to sex therapy.   ``We increasingly call them people amplifiers,'' said EarlJoseph, a futurist who heads Anticipatory Sciences Inc. in St.Paul, Minn.   Any dependence can be dangerous, and the dangers from computersrange from power failures and accidental bugs in the software tomaliciously planted viruses and the ever-present threat of BigBrotherism.   Computer viruses are the social disease of technology and willbe combated by limiting things that made computing fun in the1980s, like sharing software and communicating in networks.   As for Big Brotherism, Los Alamos National Laboratory isexploring using brain-like ``neural networks'' for voiceidentification. That could allow computers to monitor phonenetworks and locate people by the calls they make, although that'snot Los Alamos' intention.   Harvard University researchers are experimenting with similarmachines that recognize faces. Theoretically they could be used inairports and bus terminals to search for enemies of the state _again, not Harvard's intention.   Along with the threat of cold efficiency comes the threat ofcomputer-aided blunders, as with the Michigan man who was arrestedfive times after a murder suspect stole his wallet and used hisidentification.   ``There are two broad dangers,'' Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology sociologist Gary Marx has said. ``One is that thetechnologies work and the other is that they don't work.''   Stanford University's Terry Winograd tells the parable of a manwho climbs out on a long limb that starts to shake. He has twochoices: to invent an intricate, computer-controlled,limb-stabilizing system, or to wise up and get off the branch.   Too often, Winograd says, people fall in love with technologyand forget the second option. Still, computers are here to stay.They will change life, mostly for the better, in the coming decade:   _Machine translation of language will help put Americans intouch with the rest of the world. Computers already can crudelytranslate printed material, and automatic translation of livespeech is on the way. But beware: One system in Europe translatedthe French ``nous avions'' (we were having) as ``us airplanes.''   _Telerobots with human guidance will clean up crippled nuclearreactors and scour sclerotic arteries. Unlike their crudeancestors, they will be able to go about their work withoutmoment-to-moment instructions. One unnerving possibility ismilitary robots _ ``telegladiators'' _ that would lower thethreshold of war by removing people from the battle scene.   _Artificial intelligence is not going to create a human brain insilicon by the end of the 20th century. That dubious achievementmay lie another century off. But spinoffs will be everywhere, suchas an ``agent'' that scans data to assemble an electronic newspapertailored to its boss's interests.   Computers will continue to take over unskilled jobs; society'schallenge is to retrain those who are displaced to do more creativework. Joseph, the Minnesota futurist, is optimistic:   ``The short-term displacement will be horrible. But the key wordis cooperation, to make humanistic use of people. I think it'sgoing to be one of the greatest decades.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs AMs, Nov. 9, and Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
