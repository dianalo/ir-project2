At a special meeting, the shareholders also voted in favor ofGrand Metropolitan's plan to sell off its Inter-Continental chainof 100 hotels to the Saison Group of Japan for $2.15 billion and tosell new Grand Metropolitan shares to existing shareholders toraise funds toward the Pillsbury offer.   The Minneapolis-based Pillsbury, which controls the Burger Kingrestaurant chain and whose products include Green Giant vegetablesand Haagen Dazs ice cream, rejected Grand Met's offer of $60 ashare in cash last Tuesday, saying it was considering ways ofremaining independent.   Johnny Thompson, Pillsbury's vice president for publicrelations, said Monday morning he could not immediately comment onthe Grand Met shareholders' action. He said a reporter's telephonecall was the first notification he had of the action.   Grand Met launched the surprise offer Oct. 4, just five daysafter announcing the Inter-Continental sale. The company said thesemoves were part of its strategy to focus on foods, liquor andretailing and to expand its interests in the United States andJapan.   Grand Met's brands include Jandamp;B Scotch whisky and Gilbey's gin.   Grand Met Chairman Allen Sheppard said at the specialshareholders meeting, ``We don't think we will fail at thistakeover ... because we feel it is a full and fair value offer.''   In rejecting the Grand Met offer, Pillsbury said it wasconsidering several options, including a one-time special dividend,a sales of some of the company's businesses, a leveraged buyout andthe sale of an interest in the Pillsbury to a third party.   In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy out acompany and then pay off the debt with the target company's cashflow or the sale of its assets.</TEXT></DOC>
