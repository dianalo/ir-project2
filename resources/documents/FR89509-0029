It is expected that these airplaneswill continue to be operated beyond this point. The incidence of fatiguecracking on these airplanes is expected to increase as airplanes reachand exceed this goal. In order to evaluate the impact of increased fatiguecracking with respect to maintaining the fail-safe design and damage toleranceof the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 airplane structure, the manufacturer hasconducted a structural reassessment of the airplane using damage toleranceevaluation techniques. The criteria for this reassessment were containedin FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 91-56, ``Supplemental Structural InspectionProgram for Large Transport Category Airplanes,'' and Federal AviationRegulations (FAR) andSection; 25.571 (Amendment 25-45).In response to AC 91-56, McDonnell Douglas initiated the development ofa Supplemental Inspection Document (SID) for the Model DC-10 series airplanes.McDonnell Douglas and the operators established an Industry Steering Committee(ISC) for McDonnell Douglas Airplanes. At the outset, it was decided tomake maximum use of service experience and existing maintenance programs.DC-10 operators, FAA engineering personnel, and FAA Flight Standards inspectors,together with the manufacturer, have participated in generating the DC-10SID. Advisory Circular 91-56 promotes the preparation and approval of acriteria document for such a program. McDonnell Douglas developed criteriaand guidelines for: (a) Selecting the major areas of the structure, identifiedas Principal Structural Elements (PSE), which are candidates for supplementalinspection by using the latest durability and damage tolerance analysistechniques; and (b) generating a sampling inspection program. This supplementalinspection program evaluates the adequacy of current normal maintenanceinspection programs to detect fatigue damage, and provides detailed non-destructiveinspection procedures to supplement the operators' existing inspectionprograms, as necessary. The program was established on the basis of damagetolerance evaluation of each PSE selected. A PSE is defined as ``that structurewhose failure, if it remained undetected, could lead to the loss of theaircraft.'' Selection of a PSE is influenced by the susceptibility of astructural area, part or element to fatigue, corrosion, stress corrosion,or accidental damage.The DC-10 Supplemental Inspection Document, Report No. L26-012, addressesfive basic issues: (a) Identification of the selected PSE's, (b) when toaccomplish inspection (including the fatigue life threshold), (c) frequencyof inspection, (d) number of inspections required, and (e) non-destructiveinspection (NDI) procedures for detecting cracks.The SID Inspection program is based on DC-10 current usage; durability-fatigueand damage tolerance assessment of the structure using current analysistechniques and tests; and selection of the current non-destructive inspectionmethods. In order to implement the SID inspection program, each operatormust compare its current structural maintenance program to the SID requirementfor each PSE. If the current inspections equal or exceed the SID requirementsfor a given PSE, no supplemental inspections would be required for thatPSE under the SID program. However, if the opposite is true, supplementalinspections in the form of more frequent inspections or more sensitiveNDI methods, or both, would be necessary to supplement the operator's normalmaintenance program. Since the emphasis of the SID program is on agingaircraft, the inspection program is a sampling program with emphasis onthe high time aircraft of each PSE population.The population for a given PSE (and aircraft type) consists of all thoseairplanes in which the PSE has the same or similar material, fatigue life,loading, damage tolerance, and inspection characteristics. Thus, a PSEpopulation may consist of all aircraft in the fleet, or it may be dividedinto several populations because of sufficient differences in structuralconfiguration, material, damage tolerance, or non-destructive inspectioncharacteristics.Under the sampling program, each PSE would be inspected independently ofother PSE's. Symmetrical structure results in two samples per airplane,left and right. For sampling purposes, one or both sides of the aircraftmay be inspected. It is important to note that each PSE always stands byitself; that is, inspection thresholds, inspection intervals, etc., aregenerally different for each PSE.All configurations of each PSE are included in the SID program, e.g., materialchanges, structural modifications and replacements, etc. Since incorporationof McDonnell Douglas Corporation service bulletins (SB) is not mandatory,unless required by AD action, supplemental inspection procedures are providedin the SID for both pre-SB and post-SB configurations of each applicablePSE. Therefore, a PSE currently the subject of an AD is placed in a separatesection in the SID. When the closing action to a structural modificationAD has been performed, the PSE is moved into the population which reflectsthe modified structural configuration. The date and flight hours (or landings)at which modification or replacement of a PSE is made, would be requiredto be reported by the operator to McDonnell Douglas for each applicableairplane by fuselage number and/or factory serial number, and PSE number.That particular configuration is then evaluated by McDonnell Douglas. Theinspection threshold and interval will be established and published inthe next revision of the SID.The FAA recently initiated an Aging Aircraft Program to review the developmentneeds and design, maintenance, and inspection issues concerning the useof older airplanes in air carrier and commuter operations worldwide. Thisprogram has initiated, as one of its elements, an FAA/industry group toreview the service history of aging aircraft. The results of this reviewwill be a number of recommendations from industry for mandatory terminationof certain service bulletins that may contain PSE's. The FAA will reviewthese recommendations and, if appropriate, will initiate rulemaking tomandate the incorporation of terminating design changes or repairs. Ifany change to a design would affect a PSE, then the FAA will consider revisingthis AD to include that change of design in the SID inspection program,so that the new design will be inspected with the same vigor as existingdesigns. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sampling Program </ITAG>Airplanes with the highest number of flight cycles are the most likelyto experience initial fatigue damage in the fleet. Therefore, this programis based on the supplemental inspection of a ``sample'' of the high timePSE's in the fleet. Supplemental inspection of a statistically significantnumber of samples of a PSE, coupled with reporting of the results of theseinspections and, where necessary, follow-up activity, will maintain thecontinued airworthiness of the entire fleet. If no fatigue cracks are foundin the sample population and the size of the sampling population is suchthat it gives statistically meaningful data, the fatigue life thresholdmay be advanced in accordance with the SID for that PSE. The expected fatigue life of each PSE is determined by a demonstrated life,either by test or service experience, or by analysis. The time when thesupplemental inspections are to begin or be completed is determined fromthe expected fatigue life and crack propagation characteristics of eachPSE. All sample inspections are to be accomplished before the high timesample exceeds the fatigue life threshold. Irrespective of the sample size required, the 10 high time samples in thepopulation for each PSE must be inspected. However, if the number of samplesin a PSE population is 10 or less, each PSE must be inspected once beforethe fatigue life threshold is reached and repeatedly inspected when thethreshold is exceeded. The inspection interval is determined by the damagetolerance characteristics of the PSE. The results of the supplemental inspections are to be reported to the manufactureron a form provided in Volume III of the SID. This information will be presentedin the periodic revision of Volume III. In developing the SID, the working group reviewed the operation and maintenancepractices of existing maintenance programs with respect to the basic requirementsof the SID program. As a result, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 SID allowsaffected operators to take credit for maintenance already being performedand gives the operators flexibility in revising their maintenance programsto incorporate this supplemental program for their affected airplanes.The FAA reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas Supplemental InspectionDocument, Report No. L26-012, dated November 1988, which describes proceduresfor implementing a sampling inspection program of Principal StructuralElements. Since many Model DC-10 series airplanes are approaching their design lifegoal and are expected to continue to be operated beyond this point, andAD is proposed which would require inspections in accordance with the SupplementalInspection Program previously described. Information collection requirements contained in this regulation have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions ofthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) and have been assignedOMB Control Number 2120-0056.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Impact</ITAG>There are approximately 423 McDonnell Douglas DC-10 series airplanes inthe worldwide fleet. It is estimated that 244 airplanes of U.S. registryand 10 U.S. operators would be affected by this AD. It is estimated thatincorporation of the Supplemental Inspection Program for a typical operatorwill take approximately 1,000 manhours, and that the average cost wouldbe $40 per manhour. Based on these figures, the cost to U.S. operatorsto incorporate the SID program is estimated to be $400,000.The recurring inspection cost to the affected operators is estimated tobe 341 manhours per airplane per year, at an average labor charge of $40per manhour. Based on these figures, the recurring inspection cost impactof the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $3,328,160.Based on the above figures, the total cost impact of this AD is estimatedto be $3,728,160 for the first year, and $3,328,160 for each year thereafter.The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
