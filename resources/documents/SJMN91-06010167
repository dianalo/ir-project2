Scientists are planning a series of spectacular light shows in theheavens, creating brief moon-size clouds of red and blue in the midnight skyto study Earth's magnetic fields.;    &quot;It will be the brightest feature in thesky, brighter than any star or planet,&quot; said Richard Howard of NASA.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GHOSTLY ARTIFICIAL 'MOONS' TO GIVE A LIGHTSHOW IN SKY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO><TEXT>     If conditions are right, the first of seven chemical canisters will bereleased from a satellite at 5:43 p.m. PST today. A second, much larger one,will be released at 10:49 p.m. Saturday or 12:44 a.m. Sunday. The releases areexpected to be visible over most of North America.;    When released, thechemicals will be ionized by the sun's ultraviolet light, creating largeluminous clouds visible from all of North America, South America, theCaribbean and Western Europe.;    &quot;One-quarter of the world's population willbe able to see it,&quot; said Howard, an astronomer who is manager of the project.;   Dr. David S. Reasoner, the scientist in charge of the program, said theclouds will help improve the ability to predict disturbances in the ocean ofinvisible magnetic and electrical fields that surround Earth.;    The releasesof the chemicals barium and lithium will be coordinated with aircraft andground observations. They will be augmented by chemical releases from 10sounding rockets launched from Puerto Rico and the Marshall Islands.;    Byobserving the motion of the clouds, scientists can measure electrical fieldsin space and see how they interact with charged particles to form waves and tobetter understand how Earth extracts energy from the solar wind emanating fromthe sun.;    The satellite containing 16 large and eight small chemicalcanisters was launched atop an Atlas rocket July 25 from the Cape CanaveralAir Force Station in Florida. The project is being conducted jointly by theAir Force, which has 54 instruments aboard the satellite, and NASA with its 24canisters.;    The joint effort cost the Air Force $170 million and NASA $81million.;    After the canisters are released, the cloud will begin as abright pinpoint of light, spreading in 30 seconds to become one-third the sizeof the full moon with about one-tenth the brightness.;    Scientists won'tdecide until 30 minutes before a planned release whether all conditions areright to proceed, Howard said. The last of the seven in the January series isto be released Jan. 25.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; You can learn where the cloudscan be seen and when they will be released by calling (205) 544-5356.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910110  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  442  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, January 10, 199100010167,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
