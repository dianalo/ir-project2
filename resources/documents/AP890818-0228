(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Free toasters are history. Today's banksoffer thrills, excitement and chance to prospective depositors.   Support your favorite baseball team. Take a chance on theweather. Help an environmental cause. These are among the gimmicksbanks are using to lure new accounts.   Fleet National Bank, based in Providence, has offeredcertificates of deposit that encourage customers to ``put your moneywhere your mouth is'' by investing in a CD with an interest ratethat increases each time either the Red Sox or Yankees win.   A New Hampshire bank offers a CD with an interest rate thatvaries with the daily temerature.   ``From a competitors point of view, it's easier just to hike arate,'' said Tom Howe, Fleet's senior vice president in products andservices.   But the ``more creative type of deposit strategy _ one thatgenerates more enthusiasm and interest,'' helps broadens the marketby targeting unconventional CD depositors, he said.   The method appears to work. Fleet has offered sports CDs since1986, when the Boston Celtics were seeking their 16th NBAchampionship.   ``We've been quite pleased with the results,'' said Howe.   The trick was to guess the number of points the Celtics wouldscore in the final game. Those who guessed correctly saw their CDjump to 16 percent from 7 percent for the full three-month term.   When Providence College took on the University of Rhode Island atbasketball in 1987, the bank capitalized on a long-standing feud byoffering a CD with an interest rate that increased one-twentieth of1 percent for every game the customer's chosen team won.   Fleet continued the sports tradition with a ``Home Team'' CDoffered last fall in which the interest rate rose each time theBoston Bruins or Boston Celtics won a home game.   This year Fleet reoffered a baseball CD geared to the Yankees-RedSox rivalry. Only available before the teams met for the first timeJune 8, the CD increases one-tenth of 1 percent from then on eachtime the customer's chosen team wins.   If the chosen team wins the American League Championship, the CDwould receive a 1 percent bonus on the total deposit.   The Rhode Island State Police, responsible for enforcing thestate's anti-gambling laws, say they have investigated the sportsCDs and determined they are legal.   ``You are really not gambling,'' said Sgt. Terrance Burgess ofinternal affairs. `They are gong to give out a flat CD rate anywayso the element of chance, if it's there, is almost non-existent. Youcan't lose.''   The baseball CD required a $1,000 minimum deposit and offered afixed rate of 9\ percent for a six-month deposit.   Howe would not say how many sports CDs have been taken out.   ``I think the fact that the bank has offered multiple sports CDssuggests that they are well recieved by the Rhode Island public,''he said.   Rhode Islanders aren't the only ones who have welcomed theinnovation. Lincoln Savings Bank in New York, for example, offered asimilar CD based on the Yankees and Mets.   New Hampshire's Cheshire County Savings Bank offered a ``HeatWave'' CD so unusual it took more than a month to catch on.   The interest rate on the three-month CD is 10 percent of whateverthe day's high is in Concord, N.H. After October, the rates will bebased on the temperature in Orlando, Fla.   If the temperature is a record high for the day, the CD wouldincrease a half a percent more, said Elizabeth Colby, a customerservice representative at Cheshire. The rate is guaranteed not todrop below 7.5 percent and has peaked at 9.75 percent since it beganJuly 11.   ``It took a little while for people to see what it's all about,''she said. ``It's picking up.''   The CD, which requires a $500 minimum deposit, appeals to youngpeople, partly because of the low investment and also because of theunusual terms, she said.   ``Older people are more apt to want a fixed interest rate,'' saidColby. ``Younger people tend to gamble a little more.''   Fleet targeted another market with a CD it offered in theaftermath of an oil spill off the coast of Newport, R.I., earlierthis summer, agreeing to donate to Save the Bay $1 per $1,000deposited up to a maximum of $50,000.   ``The oil spill in the bay obviously increased the awareness ofmost Rhode Islanders to the environment,'' said Howe. ``So we feltthe timing of this product was really good.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday Aug. 21.</NOTE></DOC>
