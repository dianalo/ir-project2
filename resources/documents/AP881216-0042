Pazner would not elaborate, but he denied a report in the Haaretzdaily newspaper that Shamir considered granting autonomy to the 1.7million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   ``Mr. Shamir believes that unilateral moves have no value,''Pazner told The Associated Press. ``He believes only an agreementresulting from negotiations is viable.''   Haaretz quoted officials close to Shamir as saying the primeminister, who heads the right-wing Likud bloc, wanted to form acoalition with the left-leaning Labor Party as quickly as possibleand then launch a peace initiative focusing on autonomy.   The newspaper also said Shamir was deeply hurt by PresidentReagan's decision Wednesday to open talks with the PalestineLiberation Organization, which Israel considers a terroristorganization.   In a meeting with U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering on Thursday,Shamir said the U.S. decision was a ``terrible mistake,'' and hecriticized Washington for not informing Israel about it sooner,Haaretz said.   ``This behavior is unacceptable between two allies,'' Haaretzquoted Shamir as telling Pickering.   Washington's announcement that it would meet with the PLO cameafter PLO chairman Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism and said herecognized Israel's right to exist.   Pazner predicted the talks would fail.   ``We believe that the United States will discover very soon thetrue face of the PLO and will realize that it can not be a partnerfor negotiations and peace,'' he said.   Israel wants to see the U.S. initiative fail quickly, or it willface mounting international pressure for a favorable response to thePLO, analysts said.   A delay in the response could endanger relations with Washington,Israel's main ally and the source of $3 billion in annual aid.   But Ariel Merari of the Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center forStrategic Studies predicted U.S.-PLO contacts would last for``months or even a year without any dramatic developments'' as theyfocus on questions of procedure.   An agreement on a U.N.-sponsored peace conference would be thelikely outcome of successful U.S.-PLO talks. Many Israelis view itas a forum for demanding far-reaching land concessions from theJewish state.   But the first item on the agenda of U.S.-PLO contacts will be thequestion of terrorism, Secretary of State George P. Shultz toldIsraeli reporters in Washington.   ``The first point we will make in that dialogue is to emphasizeour total rejection of terrorism anywhere, outside Israel, insideIsrael,'' Shultz said in remarks broadcast on Israel television.   Merari, an expert on terrorism, said Arafat may order his Fatahfaction to refrain from terror attacks abroad or attempts toinfiltrate Israel on hostage-taking missions. But he said terrorlinked to the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories willcontinue.   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinians called the U.S.move a victory of their yearlong revolt, which has left at least 326Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead.   Dozens of Jewish settlers from the territories began a hungerstrike and pitched tents in front of Shamir's office.   ``The U.S. policy of recognizing the PLO is the seed of the nextwar,'' said Ron Nachman, a settler leader. ``Israel cannot reachagreement with the PLO. There's no common ground and the result willbe an explosion.''   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, a political rival of Shamir, saidthe Jewish state had to come up ``with a new political initiative asan answer to this situation.''   Peres proposed elections in the occupied territories to choosePalestinian leaders for peace negotiations, saying Israel ``will notnegotiate with an armed delegation instead of an elected one.''   Within Peres' left-leaning Labor party, a group of 30 dovescalled on the leadership to change the party platform and allowcontacts with the PLO.   Ezer Weizman, a Labor Cabinet minister without portfolio, saidArafat's statements made the PLO a satisfactory partner.   ``I think a new era has opened,'' he said. ``Now our politicalplatform must be reconsidered.''</TEXT></DOC>
