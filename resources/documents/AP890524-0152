But residents said the upheaval had changed their level ofawareness and interest in current events.   As one 33-year-old shopper put it, daily life in Beijingcontinues much as it did before martial law was imposed Friday, but``the people aren't the same.''   The Beijing International School, attended by most children fromthe English-speaking foreign community in Beijing, announced itwould resume classes Thursday.   School was called off a week ago because roadblocks set up bycitizens trying to keep troops out of the city created trafficproblems hazardous to children.   On Wednesday, most blockades were down and traffic appeared nearnormal. The official Xinhua News Agency reported 172 of 174 Beijingbus routes were in operation. The subway also returned to normalservice.   The blockades _ made of buses, road dividers, garbage cans andtrucks _ brought public transportation to a virtual halt for threedays. Many people relied on bicycles to get around, but othersfound it impossible to go to work.   The fashionable shopping street Wangfujing, just a few blockseast of Tiananmen Square _ the center of the protests _ was crowdedwith buses, street cars and shoppers.   Department store shelves were full and stands were brimming withlunch boxes, roasted Beijing duck, popsicles and other popular food.   ``The supplies of rice, oil, sugar and other things has beennormal,'' said a 65-year-old Agriculture Engineering Universityprofessor visiting Wangfujing.   Earlier in the week, officials had warned of imminent shortagesof basic supplies if the roadblocks remained.   Music blared from stores selling cassette tapes, while customersshelled out $46 for medicinal deer tail at the Yong Ren TangDrugstore.   At the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant on the southwest cornerof Tiananmen Square, about 30 people were lined up at the counterat 11:30 a.m. An assistant manager said business was returning tonormal after sales dropped by about half during the height of thedemonstrations.   A market about 2{ miles east of Tiananmen boasted hills ofcabbage and other vegetables, and a 31-year-old clerk insistedprices had not gone up as a result of the upheaval.   ``Before, I would just read the evening newspaper,'' said thestore clerk. ``But now I read the People's Daily, the Beijing Dailyand other papers'' for the latest developments.   A retired worker said his interest has expanded beyond economicnews. ``Now I read the news about politics, the student movementand the situation in other provinces,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
