The European consortium declined to disclose the value ofthe order, which also includes one firm order and one optionfor the shorter-range A320. The list prices of the A340 andthe A320 are $100 million and $40 million, respectively,giving the deal a value of as much as $580 million.</LP><TEXT>   Air Lanka will take delivery of the A320 in late 1992 andof the A340s in 1994 at the earliest.   The Air Lanka order follows a decision last week bySingapore Airlines to withdraw potential orders valued at asmuch as $2 billion for St. Louis-based McDonnell DouglasCorp.'s MD-11s and instead purchase A340s. Although the AirLanka order is considered by analysts to be less importantthan orders by industry leader Singapore, it marks anothervictory for Airbus in Asia -- a rapidly expanding market --and particularly for the A340.   Launched in June 1987 after the collapse of jointdevelopment talks with McDonnell Douglas, the A340 facedstiff competition from the U.S. concern's MD-11. Both arewide-body planes intended for use on long-haul routes thatdon't have enough traffic to fill the larger Boeing 747.   All Nippon Airways in April converted a letter of intentto buy 10 A340s into five firm orders and five options. InJune, Kuwait ordered 24 Airbus planes. And then last weekcame the announcement from Singapore, a prize customer formanufacturers because of the airline's tendency to replaceits planes frequently.   An advanced version of the DC-10, the MD-11 was launchedwith orders for 92 planes valued at an estimated $100 millioneach. But with the start of deliveries late last year, theMD-11 ran into mechanical and software problems, and theplane's weight made it unable to cover certain long-haulroutes.   Airbus is well-positioned to benefit from the MD-11'stroubles, analysts say, because the A340 has yet to fly andas a result hasn't demonstrated any problems. Its first testflight is scheduled for October.   The MD-11 &quot;is having some teething problems with itsrange,&quot; said Richard Golaszewski, a partner with aerospaceand airline consultants Gellman Research Associates.   He said he believes the MD-11's problems are minor andwill probably be &quot;fixed over time.&quot; But in the meantime, hesays, Airbus is likely to reap the benefits -- something thatmay cause McDonnell Douglas to increase pressure on the U.S.government to take a firmer stance in its talks with theEuropean Community over Airbus subsidies.</TEXT></DOC>
