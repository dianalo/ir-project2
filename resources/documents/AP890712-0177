He pledged to open U.S.markets to Hungarian goods and send the first Peace Corps volunteersever to a communist country.   His message was greeted with a standing ovation by the studentsof Karl Marx University of Economic Sciences, where ``Das Kapital,''the landmark treatise of the father of communism, is no longerrequired reading.   For Bush, nearing the end of a four-day swing through Poland andHungary before flying to Paris on Thursday for the economic summit,it was another dramatic gesture on his delicate mission ofencouraging democratic freedoms in the East Bloc withoutantagonizing the Soviet Union.   ``For the first time, the Iron Curtain has begun to part, andHungary, your great country, is leading the way,'' said Bush,standing on a university stage against a backdrop of Hungarian andAmerican flags.   Bush said Hungary will soon be granted most favored nationtrading status by the United States, and he announced plans to askCongress for $25 million in new aid to spur the Hungarians' movestoward a free-market economy.   Hungarian leaders gave a delighted Bush a snippet of the barbedwire fence they recently removed from their border with Austria _ abarrier that Bush said had stood as ``the ugly symbol of Europe'sdivision and Hungary's isolation.''   ``That is just beautiful. That's a marvelous symbol of this wholevisit,'' the president said.   ``There is no mistaking the fact that we are on the threshold ofa new era,'' Bush said in his speech. ``And there is also mistakingthe fact that Hungary is at the threshold of great and historicchanges.''   Imre Pozsgay, one of Hungary's four communist leaders, told Bushthe changes in his country were ``irreversible,'' and he said theruling communists would ``accept the results of free elections''scheduled next year and step down if defeated.   ``It is only the blind and deaf who can neglect the Polishexperience, especially that of the recent elections,'' Pozsgay toldreporters.   Bush's aid package was similar to the one he presented Monday toPoland, with a twist: the first-ever Peace Corps volunteersdispatched to a communist country.   Their aim will be to teach English to Hungarians. Bush said theEnglish language is already ``one of the most popular Americanexports,'' and a key to closing business deals around the world.   The students and professors applauded the offer. Two years ago,Hungary dropped Russian as a compulsory language in the schools.   In this East Bloc state long home to thousands of Soviet troopsand arms, Bush also outlined his hopes for deep cuts in conventionalarms in Europe. ``We're working day and night to get a solid,historic agreement,'' Bush said.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said later that NATO willformally present its conventional arms proposal to the Warsaw Pactin Vienna on Thursday, before those talks recess until September.   That is two months early and gives the Soviets ample time toprepare a reply, enhancing Bush's goal of achieving a conventionalarms accord within 12 months, Baker said.   Baker said he expected there would be support among the Westernallies at the Paris summit for a package of aid to reward Poland andHungary for their democratic reforms, but no pricetag has been fixed.   ``In terms of specific commitments, how many dollars country X isgoing to commit in that sort of thing, no, we don't have that yet,but we will have some substantial discussions when we get to thesummit about this,'' Baker said.   Bush also held meetings with Hungarian government leaders andopposition figures. He conferred with student leaders and gave two alift to the university in his limousine. After the speech hestrolled through a nearby market, shaking hands and plucking a wadof Hungarian currency from his pocket to purchase a dozen ripepeaches.   Bush said Hungary would be eligible to trade freely with theUnited States once it enacts legislation later in the year removingall barriers to emigration.   That would make Hungary the first country to escape restrictionsimposed under the 1974 Jackson-Vanik trade law, which imposed tradebarriers on countries that restrict emigration.   ``Hungary is opening again to the West, becoming a beacon oflight in European culture,'' Bush said. ``I see people in motion _color, creativity, experimentation.''   Bush said Hungary faced the challenge of trying ``to build astructure of political change and decentralized economic enterpriseon the ruins of a failed Stalinist system.''   The speech was shown live on Hungarian television.   Bush did not repeat the calls he made in Warsaw for austeritymeasures. Explaining, John Sununu, the White House chief of staff,said Hungary had taken long strides toward a free-market system and``they are quite justifiably proud.''   Extending another theme from his stop in Poland, the presidentwas serene in his treatment of the Soviet Union, to which the Polesand Hungarians are bound militarily in the Warsaw Pact.   ``The Soviet leaders know they have everything to gain andnothing to lose or fear from peaceful change,'' Bush said. ``We canwork together to move beyond containment, beyond the Cold War.''   The $25 million enterprise fund, which requires Congressionalapproval, would be administered jointly with Hungarians. It wouldsupport private sector development through hard currency loans orventure capital grants for approved projects.   These could include the establishment of a development bank andfunds to enable entrepreneurs to buy into Hungarian state firms.   Bush also said he will ask Congress for $5 million to establishan environmental center for Central and Eastern Europe based inBudapest.   ``The fate of the earth transcends borders. It is not just anEast-West issue,'' he said.   Pozsgay, one of the four Hungarian government leaders who metwith Bush, said the first visit by an American president hadsatisfied the hosts' expectations and given ``new opportunity bothin the reform of the Hungarian economy and the political reform.''   Opposition leaders said Bush stressed to them that themulti-party elections now being negotiated for next year should benot only free but fair.   Balint Magyar, a representative of the Alliance of FreeDemocrats, said they advised Bush not to send ``the kind of Americanhelp whereby we would have Western technology, but with Easternauthoritarianism'' controlling it.</TEXT></DOC>
