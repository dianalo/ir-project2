(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Shipments of Washington red apples fellsharply last week, the biggest drop since a nationwide health scareover a controversial growth additive began in late February, theindustry reported Friday.   Shipments also dropped significantly in Michigan, another majorapple producing state.   Total out-of-state shipments from Washington fell by 159,000boxes compared with the week before, according to the weeklyfigures compiled by the state Agriculture Department fromwarehouses.   Shipments of Red Delicious apples, the top-selling variety, fellby 178,000 42-pound boxes, but the loss was offset by a jump insales of Granny Smith apples to fill the void left when GrannySmiths from Chile were pulled from markets, officials said.   Alar is used primarily on red apples, although the industrycontends that only 5 percent of the crop is sprayed with the growthregulator.   Based on Thursday's prices for the top three varieties, thesales drop will cost Washington growers about $1.3 million for theweek.   ``I think it's a combination of Alar and the general fear a lotof people seem to have involving all produce right now,'' said BillDeWitt of the Wenatchee Valley Traffic Association, which tracksshipments.   The shipment figures are considered an accurate measure ofconsumer sales.   Apple warehouses in Washington shipped 1.25 million boxesout-of-state last week, down 11.3 percent from 1.41 million boxesthe previous week and off 19.9 percent from the 1.56 million boxesthe week before that, DeWitt said.   The warehouses shipped 1.64 million boxes during the third weekof March last year, he said.   In Michigan, the Fruit and Vegetable Market News of the U.S.Department of Agriculture and Michigan Department of Agriculturesaid shipments for the week ending March 18 were 110,955 bushels,down 30 percent from the 159,149 bushels shipped the week endingMarch 4. A bushel of apples, the USDA says is from 42 to 50 pounds.   For the week ending March 11, 133,762 bushels were shipped.   In Washington, apple exports showed a 57,000-box drop, from138,000 the week before to 81,000 boxes shipped last week, DeWittsaid.   Much of that is the decision by Taiwanese importers, theindustry's largest offshore market, to reduce purchases ofWashington apples by around 30,000 boxes per week, DeWitt said.   In addition, the industry generally begins to suffer fromreduced exports at this time of year because of competition fromnewly harvested apples from Australia, New Zealand and Chile, hesaid.   Washington is the nation's largest apple producer and generallysupplies over three-quarters of the nation's supermarket applesthis time of year, said Walt Shields of the Yakima ValleyGrowers-Shippers.   ``This is the first week we've been down appreciably from a yearago,'' Shields said.   The second consecutive week of lower sales is bad news for anindustry that still has 40 percent of the fall crop in special coldstorage, Shields said.   Those 24.6 million boxes must be sold by the time of the fallharvest, he said.   In the past two weeks, shipments of Washington apples toretailers, wholesalers, institutional buyers, exporters and othershave dropped by a combined 311,000 boxes, following threeconsecutive weeks of record shipments.   Among the major varieties, Red Delicious apples again showed thebiggest drop, 178,000 boxes to 701,000 shipped.   Golden Delicious apples dropped 16,000 boxes.   But shipments of Granny Smith apples rose to 220,000 boxes, tofill the void left when Granny Smiths from Chile were banned in thewake of a cyanide scare.   Granny Smith prices are also rising, from about $20 per boxseveral weeks ago to $26 per box Thursday, said Jeff Main of thefederal-state Market News Service office in Yakima.   The apple industry's troubles began in late February when theNatural Resources Defense Council, a consumer group issued a reportthat eating apples treated with Alar increased the cancer risk inchildren.   That report has been disputed by federal regulators and theapple industry, but nevertheless prompted apple bans in schoolcafeterias, cancelation of some foreign orders and reduced retailsales.</TEXT></DOC>
