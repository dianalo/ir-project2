A major conclusion of this group was that an intensiveresearch and development program would need to be established to addressthe problem of explosives detection, and that FAA would be responsiblefor such an effort. Due to a rash of hijacking incidents during the early1970's, the U.S. Congress recognized the need to increase overall securityof the U.S. airport system. As a result, FAA sponsored several programsto investigate and develop the possibility of using thermal neutron technologyin an EDS to detect plastic explosives in airline baggage. As a resultof these efforts, a contract was awarded in 1985 to Science ApplicationsInternational Corporation (SAIC) of Santa Clara, California, to developand operate these systems as a contractor to FAA. Since that time, threethermal neutron activation (TNA) devices have been developed. The TNA devices use thermal neutrons from californium-252 to activate nitrogenatoms in plastic explosives. When radiation from the decay of activatednitrogen atoms in an explosive is detected, a computer attached to thesystem gives a warning signal that explosives in luggage are being smuggledonto an airplane. Because some activition of materials in both the baggageand baggare contents may occur, both workers and the public may be exposedto the radiation emitted during the decay of the induced radioactivity.Radiation exposure, either internal or external, constitutes the majorperceived impact of the system. In May 1987, the State of California, upon receiving the request from SAICfor a temporary site license to test the device, requested technical assistancefrom NRC in evaluating the first prototype, Model EDS-2, NRC performedan Environmental Assessment, and issued a Finding of No Significant Impactin September 1988. Based on the results of the Environmental Assessment,the State of California issued a temporary site permit to SAIC to performinitial testing of the EDS-2. Since the manufacturer was located in California,the device review as performed by the California Department of Health Services.On January 31, 1989, California completed its review, entered a devicesheet into the Registry of Radioactive Sealed Sources and Devices, andconcluded that the EDS-2 was acceptable for licensing purposes. Currently, the FAA is the license, and its Technical Center Headquartersis in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Thus, the technical review and completedlicensing actions were performed in NRC's Region 1. On February 8, 1980,Region I issued FAA a license to use the EDS-2 on the ramp level (nearthe plane) of international airports located in this country. Althougha license was issued to use the prototype device, the FAA and SAIC hadconcluded that the EDS-2 was a one-of-a-kind prototype, and would not beused for future routine operational baggage scanning. Based on the foregoing conclusion, a second, straight-through device (EDS-3)was developed and completed earlier this year, and FAA has submitted anamendment to NRC to have this device licensed for operational use in airportsthroughout the U.S. NRC Headquarters and the State of California have jointlyevaluated the EDS-3, and on August 2, 1989, California issued a devicesheet, which concluded that the EDS-3 was acceptable for licensing purposes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Identification of the Proposed Action</ITAG>The proposed action is an amendment to Materials License No. 29-13141-05,to authorize FAA to install and operate Model EDS-3 units in baggage orcargo-handling ramp (near the plane) areas at airports anywhere in theU.S., provided that these areas are remotely located from passenger ticketingand processing areas. The Environmental Assessment includes the evaluationof impacts from operations in the baggage or cargo-handling areas at airportsanywhere in the U.S.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Need for the Proposed Action</ITAG>The need for improved baggage security persists. In recent years, therehas been an increase in the sophistication of the type of explosive devicesused in terrorist activities, resulting in the loss of many lives. As partof its efforts, on July 10, 1989, FAA published a proposal for rulemakingin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> that would require U.S. air carriers to use explosivedetection systems to screen checked baggage (54 FR 28985; July 10, 1989).The recent events involving air piracy and terrorism against civil aviationdemonstrate the need for explosives detection systems that would help toprotect the security of passengers, aircraft and crew members aboard U.S.air carriers.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action</ITAG>For the EDS-3, each installation is in an airport baggage-handling area,generally in the lower level of an airport. It is estimated that a spaceallocation of approximately 25 m5 (270 ft2) would be required for the EDS-3plus ancillary operations. The heavy weight of the unit (=10 tons) might,in some cases, require construction of additional structural support; however,because it is anticipated that the EDS-3 would usually be located on theground floor, this would probably not be necessary. Because the baggage-handlingareas are at the ramp level (the level at which aircraft are parked), nosignificant impact on routine terminal passenger flow or airport trafficflow is expected.The NRC staff has previously assessed the environmental impacts of theEDS-2 in the ``Environmental Assessment for Explosive Detection SystemsUsing Thermal Neutron Activation for Airline Baggage Inspection,'' September1988. Calculation of radiological doses resulting from potential activationof baggage contents were based on the following considerations: (1) Thesystem is located in a baggage-handling area where access is controlled;(2) the californium used in the EDS-3 will always be a sealed source, whichwill be doubly encapsulated and seal-welded in stainless steel Zircaloy;(3) the only exposure pathway considered for normal and accident scenariosis the direct radiation path; ingestion or inhalation are not consideredbecause the source remains intact (even in the explosion scenarios); (4)the approximate screening time per bag is six seconds; (5) an extremelyconservative estimate for mass of one kilogram (2.2 pounds) was used indetermining the dose rates for various elements; and (6) passengers willnot have access to checked luggage for at least one hour after it passesthrough the EDS-3. Although the thermal neutron fluence of the EDS-3 is3.6E05 neutrons/cm2, the original (EDS-2) thermal neutron fluence of 8.0E05neutrons-cm2 was used as an upper bound for the amount of activation productsthat could be induced by the neutron radiation.The environmental assessment thoroughly investigated potential exposurepathways to workers and passengers, and concluded that after a minimumone-hour decay time, neutron activation of elements and contents in suitcasesdoes not contribute significantly to natural background radiation exposure.In view of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements(NCRP) and the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP)recommendations regarding the quality factor, it was assumed that neutronquality factors will be increased by a factor of two. Therefore, neutrondose rates and doses from external exposure to neutrons presented in thisassessment used the higher projected quality factors which were calcualtedfor both workers (normal and accident scenarios) and passengers (accidentscenarios only).Radiation doses to workers were assessed. Two to five individuals per shiftoperate or work on the EDS, which typically, will include one operatorand one baggage handler. In operating the EDS-3, there are three majorpathways for EDS exposure: (1) Exposure during normal operation, due toattenuated radiation penetrating the shield around the californium sourcein the immediate vicinity of the EDS and from handling the baggage thathas been irradiated; (2) exposure, with the source in the safe positionduring maintenance or to clear baggage jams; and (3) exposure during sourcetranser operations to or from a shipping cask. A conservative estimatefor annual doses to operational workers would be less than 200 mrem fromthe direct radiation exposure. The estimated total effective dose equivalentrate from various sources of natural background radiation for the continentalU.S. is approximately 300 millirem per year (NCRP Report 94).Potential radiation doses to passengers were also assessed. The two majorpathways to the public during normal operations are: (1) Direct radiationexposure of passengers to beta or gamma fields from reclaimed luggage and(2) internal dose to passengers or other members of the public who consumea food or other irradiated item that was contained in reclaimed luggage.The largest remaining exposures from a one kilogram mass of various elementsone hour after passing through the EDS are from In-116m (0.019 milliremper our) and Eu-152m (0.005 millirem per hour), both of which are veryunlikely to be found in luggage. Neutron activation of elements in clothing(carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen) does not lead to significant amountsof residual activity in suitcases. Activation of the components of typicalaccessories is also small.Potential exposures due to a malfunction of the EDS were also studied,because a baggage jam would produce a longer irradiation time. The potentialdose from a 40-gram gold medallion that had passed through the EDS wasevaluated. The potential beta particle dose at a depth of 0.007 cm beneaththe skin next to the jewelry was estimated to be about 0.7 millirad, ifthe item were worn continuously for approximately 10 days after claimingthe luggage. The ICRP has assigned a risk weighting factor for skin of0.01, so the effective dose equivalent would be about 0.007 Millirem. If0.5 percent of passengers carry gold medallions in their luggage and subsequentlywear them for an extended period, the effective collective dose from thisscenario for operation of ten luggage-inspection systems would be about0.4 person-rem in one year.To assess the second pathway (internal dose), it was assumed that a one-daysupply of food was packed in a suitcase, screened by the EDS, and thenclaimed by the passenger after a short domestic flight. The time from EDSscreening to consumption of food was taken to be one hour. The total effectivedose equivalent from the average daily intake of the ten elements (usingICRP Publication 23, Reference Man.) contributing the largest doses wasdetermined. The dose values are the weighted committed doses for thesenuclides taken from ICRP 30, and summed over the target organs or tissues.The results show that salt is the principal source of radiation exposurefrom consumption of food items that have passed through the EDS, contributingabout 90 percent of the effective dose equivalent. It was assumed thatif one percent of passengers carry food items in their luggage, consumeit within one hour of reclaiming their luggage (after being screened bythe EDS), the annual collective dose to an estimated one-million passengersis 3E-04 person-rem/year.For the purposes of environmental analysis, the impacts from several differentaccident scenarios were assessed. The scenario involving a plane crashand subsequent fire accident was assessed because it has the greatest potentialfor release and would bound a spectrum of other potential accidents thatcould occur. For this postulated accident, the total amount of californium-252was assumed to be ignited and released as radioactive effluent. The doseto the maximally exposed individual is estimated to be less than 300 milliremfor a fire. Such a dose does not exceed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) Protective Action Guides (PAGs) of one rem whole-body dose and fiverem thyroid dose. Although the dose estimates would not necessitate offsiteprotection actions, FAA has implemented fire-protection and emergency-preparednessplans.The potential for radiological exposure to transport workers and to membersof the general public in the U.S., due to routine transportation, was assessedin NUREG-0170. Based on the total amount of californium-252 to be shipped,an estimated one shipment per year would be required to maintain the appropriateneutron fluence rate levels.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>Based on the foregoing assessment, the NRC staff concludes that the environmentaleffects of normal EDS-3 operations, when located in the baggage ramp areaof an airport, are expected to be extremely small. For all radionuclides,the maximum unrestricted area concentrations are calculated to be wellbelow the maximum permissible concentrations specified in 10 CFR 20.106and 10 CFR part 20, Appendix B.<ITAG tagnum="84">Alternatives to the Proposed Action</ITAG>The principal alternative to the proposed action is that of no action orto individually hand-search all checked luggage or cargo. In view of theforegoing conclusion that the proposed action will not result in any significantimpact, to prefer this alternative over the proposed action is not justified.<ITAG tagnum="84">Agencies and Persons Contacted</ITAG>In performing this assessment, staff used the environmental report datedFebruary 1988, an environmental assessment for the EDS-2 dated September1988, the licensee's application dated October 31, 1988, and the licensee'samendment application dated April 19, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment related to theamendment of Materials License No. 29-13141-05, entitled ``EnvironmentalAssessment for Explosive Detection Systems Using Thermal Neutron Activationfor Airline Baggage Inspection.'' On the basis of this assessment, NRChas concluded that the environmental impacts that would be created by theproposed licensing action would not be significant and do not warrant thepreparation of an Environmental Impact Statement.
