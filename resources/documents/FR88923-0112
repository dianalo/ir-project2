The purpose of this workshop is to discuss the establishmentof standards for IL-1, TNF, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, IL-3, IL-4, and IL-6.FDA requires biological potency testing for the licensure of biologicalproducts. However, many cytokines are currently being used in clinicaltrials before recognized standards are available. The establishment ofbiological standards for cytokines would be of benefit to manufacturers,regulatory agencies, and clinicians. BRMP would like to standardize cytokinesand provide distribution services for these standards in the same way thatit has established and distributed the BRMP standard for IL-2.The goal of this workshop is to improve standardization of specific cytokinebioassays. The sessions will include selected presentations of specificcytokine bioassays describing procedure, unit definition, data calculation,and standardization. A general discussion of the pros and cons of the differentassays as well as the potential for standardization will follow each session.Criteria for the selection of standards will be discussed but actual testingand selection of the standards will be done by the sponsors as a followupto this meeting.To obtain a copy of the tentative agenda and preregistration packet contactMargaret Fanning (telephone and address above). Persons planning to attendshould be aware that space is limited and should contact Margaret Fanningas soon as possible.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 16, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John M.
