The suit, brought by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, is the first attempt by the government to control the operations of an entire commercial center allegedly dominated by crime. It is another example of the Justice Department's recent tactic of seeking court-appointed trustees to run unions with alleged crime ties, as well as naming whole crime families as defendants in civil racketeering suits.    Besides a union trustee, the suit seeks court appointment of an &quot;administrator&quot; to oversee the operations of the entire Fulton complex, including loading areas and parking facilities.    The lawsuit portrays the market's 100 wholesalers and the retailers who purchase fish there as victims of the Genovese crime family's &quot;racketeering activity,&quot; including extortion. The government estimated that the fish market handles a billion pounds of seafood annually, worth several billion dollars and distributed mainly in the Northeast.    This is the fourth time U.S. prosecutors have sought to use the civil provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act to put a union into trusteeship -- the most recent being the trusteeship of Teamsters Local 814 announced by U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney in Brooklyn last week. The big Teamsters Local 560 in New Jersey has been under a court trustee since mid-1986, and in March a New York City concrete workers union also was placed in trusteeship.    &quot;This is exactly the type of lawsuit that Congress had in mind when it enacted the civil RICO law,&quot; Rudolph W. Giuliani, U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said yesterday. Mr. Giuliani's action names the entire Genovese crime family itself and 29 alleged members or associates, as well as Local 359 of the United Seafood Workers union; the suit said the Genovese crime family has controlled the union and the fish market since the 1930s. In Brooklyn, Mr. Maloney's suit involving the Teamsters named the Bonanno crime family.    The defendants are due to appear at an Oct. 26 hearing on the government's requested preliminary injunction seeking &quot;one or more&quot; trustees to run the local. In scheduling the hearing, U.S. District Judge Lee P. Gagliardi, in White Plains, N.Y., issued a temporary order banning three alleged Genovese members from participating in the union local's affairs. The case itself will be handled in New York City.    The Fulton suit focuses attention on one of New York's best-known tourist attractions, the 150-year-old fish market and the adjoining four-year-old South Street Seaport development, a museum and upscale shopping mall. However, &quot;we aren't seeking to have any oversight of the Seaport,&quot; said Edward T. Ferguson, an assistant U.S. attorney working on the case.    The lawsuit states that wholesalers at the market aren't allowed to unload their fish themselves, but must pay crews controlled by the Genovese family. The suit also accuses the union unloading crews of &quot;tapping&quot; fish -- or opening boxes and removing some fish -- and that wholesalers fear retaliation if they complain.    The two-block fish market on the Lower East Side has been beset by extortion and fear for decades, law enforcement officials say. Even in 1981, after prosecutors brought four successful market-related cases in federal court, evidence showed continued extortion of payments to &quot;protect&quot; businesses, widespread theft, the intimidation and even shooting of witnesses.    Mr. Giuliani's bid for supervision of the huge fish market, the country's largest, was criticized by an attorney who represents Anthony &quot;Fat Tony&quot; Salerno, the Genovese family's purported longtime boss. Mr. Salerno, who isn't named in the Fulton suit, is currently serving a 100-year prison term for his conviction in the so-called Mafia Commission case.    &quot;The fact that they think some way they can take over a fish market, the whole thing is ridiculous,&quot; said Mr. Salerno's attorney, Anthony M. Cardinale, of the lawsuit. Speaking of the new use of the civil RICO law to take over unions and other entities, Mr. Cardinale added: &quot;They've got this new darling in their arsenal. One guy does it, gets some press, and everyone jumps on the bandwagon.&quot;    In Washington, Allen Zack, a spokesman for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, Local 359's parent, said if there are &quot;bad people&quot; at the market the government should seek indictments rather than trying to &quot;run democratic institutions.&quot; He added: &quot;By the same ground rules (Mr. Giuliani) should be in court asking to place the New York Stock Exchange in trusteeship because of all the insider-trading scandals.&quot;    Mr. Giuliani's office, in another use of civil RICO law that generated derision from defense lawyers, last year succeeded in having a receiver appointed to run Umberto's Clam House, a small restaurant in Manhattan's Little Italy section that was implicated in a racketeering case. </TEXT></DOC>
