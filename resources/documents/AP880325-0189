The sources said the first troops of the 82nd Airborne Division,based at Fort Bragg, N.C., will return Monday and the entire forcewill be back home within two or three days after.   There was no immediate confirmation from U.S. military spokesmenhere. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.   The Americans were deployed here from the United States in adramatic show of force after President Jose Azcona Hoyo asked forhelp, charging that Nicarguan forces had penetrated Honduranterritory while chasing U.S.-backed Contra rebels.   Honduran government officials said tensions had subsided alongthe border and that the Sandinista troops had withdrawn.   ``It's peaceful on the border,'' presidential spokesman LisandroQuesada said. ``There are no Sandinista troops in Honduras.''   Honduras has reported several smaller incursions since thearrival of paratroopers from Fort Bragg and light infantry fromFort Ord, Calif., on March 17-18.   The U.S. forces continued joint training exercises Friday withHonduran troops at four bases throughout the country, Cap. BrianDeLoche, a public affairs officer at Palmerola Air Base said.   DeLoche said the soldiers expected to go home next week, butwere still awaiting orders. DeLoche spoke by telephone from thebase, about 40 milies northwest of the capital of Tegucigalpa.   Deployment of the reinforcements brought U.S. military strengthin Honduras to more than 6,000, alarming even the friendlygovernments in the region.   The Sandinistas accused the United States of either preparing toinvade Nicaragua or using the training exercises to cover up thedelivery of arms and equipment for the Contras, whose U.S. militaryaid was cut off by Congress last month.   Some congresmen voiced similar suspicions about the equipmentbrought here with the troops, including combat helicopters andlarge quantities of weapons.   Auditors from the General Accounting Office, Congress' watchdog,were to come to Palmerola to make sure the equipment went home withthe troops.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Michael O'Brien said the auditors werecoming at the request of several U.S. lawmakers. Neither he norDeLoche could say when the auditors were due in Honduras.   Since the troops' arrival, there have been major developments inthe six-year war between Nicaragua's leftist government the rebels.The two sides agreed Wednesday to a 60-day cease-fire as a preludeto talks on permanent peace.   Meanwhile, Honduran military air reconnaissance Thursday of thefrontier in Olancho and El Paraiso provinces detected no Sandinistaactivity in Honduras, said Eugenio Castro, a Foreign Ministryspokesman.   The ministry had filed what it called an ``energetic protest''with Nicaragua Thursday over what it said were two borderincursions involving a total of about 350 Sandinistas this week.   No confrontations were reported.   In Guatemala, a meeting of representatives of the five CentralAmerican nations who signed a regional peace accord on Aug. 7,1987, apparently broke down over the issue of U.S. troops.   Nicaragua demanded withdrawal of U.S. troops from Honduras andHonduras countered by demanding that Nicaragua withdraw a complaintfiled with the World Court in The Hague, Netherlands. The complaintaccuses Honduras and Costa Rica of harboring Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
