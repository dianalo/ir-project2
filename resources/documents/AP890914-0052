Messengers from the National Wildlife Federation on Wednesdaydelivered zip-lock plastic bags of oil-stained Alaska rocks tomembers of Congress, the White House, and other key members of theBush administration, said a spokesmen for the federation.   Rocks also were delivered to top executives of Exxon Corp., inNew York, said Jay Hair, the federation's president.   ``These are the rocks that Exxon has cleaned twice,'' said Hair,adding that he brought them back from Smith Island, one of the areasof Alaska most affected by the massive spill from the Exxon Valdezoil tanker last March.   Despite the double cleaning, oil continues to seep up frombeneath, having penetrated as much as 40 inches in some areas, theenvironmentalists said.   Criticism of Exxon's cleanup efforts increased this week as thehugh oil company was pulling most of its equipment and manpower outof the polluted areas for the winter. No further cleanup activity isplanned until next spring, if at all, and Exxon claims that most ofthe contaminated beaches have been ``environmentally stabilized.''</TEXT><NOTE>Regions Shortchanged In Federal Funding, Wolpe Says</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Northeast and Midwest are faring poorly inthe scramble for federal dollars, a situation likely to worsen afterthe 1990 Census records the Sunbelt's growth, leaders of a Rust Beltcoalition say.   ``The demographics are moving against us and representation inCongress is moving against us,'' William S. Woodside, chairman ofthe Northeast-Midwest Leadership Council, said Wednesday at thegroup's annual meeting. ``We're hurting.''   The federal government returned to the 18-state region only 87cents for every dollar its citizens paid in taxes over the pasteight years, shortchanging it by $359 billion, said Rep. HowardWolpe, D-Mich.   ``At a time when our states are short of funds for much-neededinvestments in education, public infrastructure and environmentalprotection, we can ill afford such massive disinvestment in ourregion,'' said Wolpe, co-chairman of a bipartisan coalition of morethan 100 House members from the Northeast and Midwest.   Three developments suggest the trend probably will continue, hesaid.   First, programs that have pumped large sums into the region inrecent years are likely victims of deficit-reducing cuts.   Secondly, the $150 billion savings and loan bailout will shiftmoney from programs in the Northeast and Midwest to the Southwestwhere most of the troubled Sandamp;Ls are located, Wolpe said.   Third, the Northeast and Midwest will likely lose up to 14 seatsin the House of Representatives as a result of the 1990 Census, saidWolpe.</TEXT><NOTE>Production Increase Will Be Permitted</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wheat farmers will be permitted to increaseproduction for 1990 to allow the government to replenish its wheatreserves, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says.   The Agriculture Department will dip into its reserve for some 3.5million metric tons of wheat for this year and next to meet U.S.commitments for international food aid, a department statement saidWednesday.   The change in the wheat program will cause a slight increase inthe overall income of wheat farmers, the statement said.   Because of the program change, acreage of harvested wheat willincrease from an estimated 67.5 million acres to 69.6 million acres.   Under the 1990 wheat program, farmers are required to idle 5percent of their wheat acreage to qualify for federal supports.   Farmers now will be allowed to plant more than 95 percent of thefarm's wheat base, rising to a limit of 105 percent, the statementsaid.   ``The action today does not suggest that we expect another yearof less than average wheat yields, nor will it boost stockssignificantly,'' Yeutter said. ``But it will help restore stocks tosafer levels. In view of the tight U.S. and world supply and demandsituation, we should give wheat producers the option to increaseplantings if they wish to do so.''</TEXT></DOC>
