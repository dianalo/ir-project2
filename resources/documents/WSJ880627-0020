The offer was previously scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m. EDT Saturday. Under it, Bank of New York is offering Irving shareholders a combination of $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of Bank of New York for each Irving share.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Bank of New York closed at $34.125 a share, up 12.5 cents, making the value of the tender $68.75 a share. At that price, the value of Irving as a whole is about $1.29 billion.    Irving shares closed in Big Board trading Friday at $71 a share, up 62.5 cents, indicating that investors expect a better offer either from Bank of New York or another party. Banca Commerciale Italiana S.p.A., a friendly suitor, has offered $80 a share for 51% of Irving's shares. But that offer is subject to regulatory delays and isn't valued as highly by many investors as the hostile Bank of New York offer.    Irving has about 18.7 million shares outstanding. Bank of New York said that 5.2 million shares have been tendered. In addition, Bank of New York already owns 888,634 shares, giving it a total potential stake of 32.6%.    Through a spokesman, Irving declined comment. Last week, Irving declined to respond to a deadline set by Bank of New York, which had said it would sweeten its hostile offer by 12% if Irving responded favorably by noon Thursday. An Irving director, David L. Luke, said then that Irving directors would have been &quot;derelict&quot; in their duties if they had responded by the deadline. </TEXT></DOC>
