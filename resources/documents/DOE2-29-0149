There are not 15 to 25 nuclear weapons nations, as PresidentKennedy feared there would be by the mid-1970s. Technical capabilityhas not driven nations to forge nuclear arsenals and turn the world intoa nuclear crowd. Instead, the industrial North, except the weapons statesthemselves, has foresworn the bomb and has accepted the Non-ProliferationTreaty (NPT) or its constraints, and most of the developing countrieshave done the same. Four or five of the latter have come close to thethreshold, but for 22 years no country has officially joined the five-membernuclear-weapons club. Growing fears of the superpowers nuclear arms racecoupled with declining confidence in the promise of nuclear power haveled Third World Nations to set a much higher value on the NPT; perhaps,too they perceive that money wasted on unusable nuclear arms means lessfor usable non-nuclear weapons and equipment. Whatever the future, IAEAsafeguards are a crucial part of the nonproliferation regime; they contributeto the security of all nations, and can serve as an example for armscontrol. 6 references.</TEXT></DOC>
