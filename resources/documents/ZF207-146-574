Zadeh, a professor of computer science at the Universityof California at Berkeley, has worked with 'fuzzy logic' for 25years.andP;  His ideas have been largely ignored in the US, but histheories are popular in other countries.andP;  For example, Japan'sMinistry of International Trade and Industry will open aLaboratory for International Fuzzy Engineering Research (LIFE), inApr 1989, funded with $36 million.andP;  Fuzzy logic finds its firstapplications in control systems, specifically in controllingindustrial processes.andP;  Whatever will happen with fuzzy logic, onething is certain.andP;  The US will lag behind the Japanese in itsdevelopment.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Fuzzy SetsComputer ScienceCalifornia, University of (Berkeley)Control SystemsProcess ControlArtificial IntelligenceCognitive ScienceScientific ResearchJapanese CompetitionUnited StatesJapan.
