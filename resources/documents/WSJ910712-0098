The San Francisco-based utility's gas procurement arm,Alberta andamp; Southern Gas Co., offered to pay between $1.25 and$1.70 per thousand cubic feet of gas, up from the $1.20 to$1.50 it offered producers last month. That first offer wascalled a &quot;devastating&quot; proposal and was rejected by a largemajority of producers.</LP><TEXT>   About one billion cubic feet of gas flows south daily toPacific Gas andamp; Electric from western Canada, purchased fromthe 190 producers that form the Alberta andamp; Southern gas pool.Under long-term contracts, prices are negotiated annually toreflect changes in supply and demand.   In the second round of negotiations, Alberta andamp; Southern isproposing a three-tier pricing structure, with peak wintershipments, mid-season deliveries in late summer andlow-season shipments from March until July. But while theaverage price of $1.45 for the gas is higher than thepreviously proposed $1.30 per thousand cubic feet, it stillfalls short of the levels hoped for by many producers.   &quot;This is just a nickel-and-dime increase,&quot; said RobertLamond, chairman and chief executive officer of CzarResources Ltd., a Calgary-based producer. &quot;I'm sure it'll besoundly rejected by the Alberta producers.&quot;   Mr. Lamond said that in determining the price it will payfor Canadian gas, Pacific Gas is comparing long-term Canadiansupplies with short-term gas from the U.S. Southwest.   &quot;Long-term gas always commands a premium,&quot; he said. &quot;Thatis comparing apples and oranges.&quot;   The producers forming the Alberta andamp; Southern gas supplypool have until next Friday to vote on the proposals. Underthe Alberta Gas Marketing Act, at least 50% of producersrepresenting at least 60% of the volume of gas to be soldmust agree to terms of the pricing proposals.</TEXT></DOC>
