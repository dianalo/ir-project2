BillClements said at a hearing in Waxahachie.   Only a few people among about 600 who attended a hearing at inStockbridge, Mich., expressed reservations. A union officialdescribed the mood at that session as a ``pep rally,'' with youngwomen handing out buttons extolling the SSC and banners and roadsigns declaring, `Michigan Is the Place To Be.''   Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, North Carolina and Tennessee alsoare semi-finalists in the selection process. New York dropped outbecause of strong local opposition at its proposed site.   Scientists say the super collider, a huge atom-smasher 53 milesin circumference, will provide new depth in high energy physicsresearch.   When completed in 1996, the facility is expected to provide2,500 jobs and an annual payroll of $270 million.   Clements spoke near the beginning of a public hearing on theenvironmental impact of the project on Ellis County, south ofDallas.   Officials said 112 people had signed up to make comments duringthe 4{-hour hearing Tuesday afternoon. A second hearing wasscheduled for the evening.   Local and state officials asserted the project has overwhelmingsupport in the area southeast of Lansing, Mich.   ``People have questions, but once those questions are answered,people are overwhelmingly supportive,'' said state Rep. DebbieStabenow, a Democrat whose district would include part of theaccelerator.   Tuesday's meeting was advertised by the U.S. Department ofEnergy as an ``environmental scoping'' session to explain theproject and allow citizens a chance to comment about issues whichshould be considered in preparing an environmental impact statement.   ``This is not a public referendum, but it is important weunderstand how people feel,'' said Brian Quirke, a spokesman forthe DOE.   ``Michigan needs it for (economic) diversification,'' said DickHowlett, a member of the Stockbridge Village Council, whichunanimously supports the project.   He said some property owners who would be displaced are worriedabout compenstation, but he said three-quarters of the people whoattended a recent council meeting supported the project.   However, one man questioned whether the project had a militaryapplication.   ``I personally feel it will be a tool used for military uses,''said Steve Grose of Onondaga. ``There is no doubt it would be usedfor military means.''</TEXT></DOC>
