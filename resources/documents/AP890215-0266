(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chairman of the Coleman Co., whoseworld-famous lanterns and stoves played a major role in two worldwars, said Wednesday he has received bank funding assurances for a$332 million leveraged buyout.   Sheldon C. Coleman said he and other family members formedChatham Acquisition Corp. and retained Goldman Sachs and Co. asfinancial adviser for a $64-a-share buyout of the company founded byhis grandfather in 1899.   A special committee of Coleman's board is considering the offer.   But Coleman stock traded far above the family offer Wednsday,closing up 87.5 cents at $71 on the New York Stock Exchange.   More than 672,00 shares changed hands on the heels of 1.9 milliontraded Tuesday, when the stock gained $21 a share. The normalaverage daily trading volume for the company is 20,700 shares.   Coleman camping products include the G.I stove, once rated withthe Jeep as the two most important pieces of equipment in World WarII, and the lantern, a staple of World War I. The company says thatby last year it had sold 40 million lanterns.   Coleman now also makes coolers, jugs, sleeping bags, heaters, hottubs, fishing boats, air conditioners and air guns.   Coleman, 36, is the grandson of founder W.C. Coleman. He waselected chairman last fall after the death of his father. Colemanwent public in 1920. The buyout offer would take the company privateagain.   The company said in a statement that Chatham had received acommitment letter from First National Bank of Chicago for up to $415million to make the deal.   The bank also has agreed that $330 million of that amount will beavailable as a bridge loan, the statement said. Family members saidthey would provide another $20 million bridge loan.   The Coleman family said it owns about 27 percent of the company's7.1 million shares outstanding. The leveraged buyout offerapparently would account for all the shares Coleman doesn't alreadyown. Overall, the $64-a-share bid values the company at $454 million.   Chatham's offer consists of $54 cash per share with preferredstock intended to have a value of $10.   Some analysts pointed out Wednesday there is a nearly $50 milliongap between what the stock was trading for and Chatham's offer.</TEXT></DOC>
