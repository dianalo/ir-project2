In response, the State Department said U.S. forces ``do notintend to prevent normal diplomatic activity by Cuban personnel.Charges to the contrary are not true.'' The department said U.S.troops are stationed around the Cuban Embassy and several otherplaces in Panama for security reasons.   The statement did not address the specific question of access tothe Cuban missions or the Cuban claim that the troops were engagedin threatening activities.   Angel Pino, spokesman for the Cuban diplomatic mission here,said the situation is particularly serious at the ambassador'sresidence, where the Cuban diplomats and their families have beenstaying since the U.S. invasion last week.   Supplies of food and medicine are running low and the sense ofunease among those at the residence has been aggravated byoverflights of U.S. warplanes and helicopers, he said.   The situation is ``becoming grave,'' Pino said, adding that anyincident could provoke ``unforeseeable consequences.'' He said hisgovernment has ``protested insistently'' to American authorities.He had no estimate of the number of Cubans at the residence.   In a telephone interview, Pino said the Cuban government wasinformed by U.S. officials in Washington and Havana over theweekend that the situation would be resolved shortly. But there wasno change as of late morning today, Pino said.   A State Department official said he had no information thatCubans in Panama were being denied the right to enter or leave theembassy grounds.   He said a Cuban diplomat in Panama reportedly told a Cuban radiostation on Saturday that access to and from the residence was not aproblem. But Pino said U.S. troops began blocking access both waysthat same afternoon.   The State Department official, asking not to be identified, saidthe troops outside the residence and the chancery are providingsecurity at those locations.   But Pino said Cuban diplomats were told by a U.S. militaryofficer in charge outside the residence that his instructions were``to prevent anybody from leaving or entering the embassy.''   He identified the U.S. officer only as Major Acksun.   Initially U.S. officials had been concerned that Panama's Gen.Manuel Antonio Noriega might try to seek refuge in either the Cubanor Nicaraguan embassies in Panama City. The installations of bothcountries were surrounded late last week, prompting the Nicaraguangovernment to dispatch two tanks to the American Embassy in Managua.   Noriega turned himself in to the Vatican Embassy in Panama CitySunday afternoon. Pino said the U.S. troop presence at the Cubanambassador's residence has been reinforced since then.</TEXT></DOC>
