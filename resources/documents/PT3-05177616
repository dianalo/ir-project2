The display is connected to the chamber by an arm having a pair of      end portions and a shank portion intermediate the end portions, a proximal      one of the end portions being secured to the chamber and a distal other of      the end portions being secured to the display. The proximal one arm end      portion is pivotable in the first substantially vertical plane relative to      the chamber to move the display between a stow orientation wherein the      display is stowed in the chamber and an intermediate orientation wherein      the display is outside of the chamber. The shank portion is pivotable in a      substantially horizontal plane relative to the proximal one arm end      portion to move the display between the intermediate orientation and a      generally vertical use orientation wherein the display is in a second      plane. The distal other arm end portion is pivotable relative to the shank      portion to tilt the display between the generally vertical use orientation      and a tilted use orientation wherein the display is tilted relative to the      second plane for ease of viewing. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to a video display assembly and more      particularly to such an assembly wherein the video display may be stowed      within an armrest of a seat on an aircraft or other vehicle. </PAR><PAR>  European Patent Application 90902831.8 filed Feb. 7, 1990, and published as      0 411 149 A1, and PCT Application Serial No. PCT/JP90/99180 filed Feb. 14,      1990, and published as W090/10403 are both directed to assemblies enabling      a television receiver or video display to be stowed (i.e., stored when not      in use) within an armrest of a seat on an airplane or other vehicle, but      easily removed therefrom to a viewing location. In each case, the video      display is pivoted in a vertical plane about a horizontal axis from its      stowed location within the armrest upwardly and forwardly (towards the      seat in the row ahead), the video display then being pivoted in a      horizontal plane about a vertical axis passing through the video display. </PAR><PAR>  One disadvantage in common of such prior art assemblies is that the video      display is disposed relatively low, the bottom of the video display barely      clearing the top of the armrest, so that the viewer of average height has      to bend his/her head downwardly at a sharp angle for viewing. A further      disadvantage is that the video display is not centered in front of the      viewer, but rather has at least a portion thereof vertically aligned with      the armrest so that the viewer, in addition to bending his/her head      downwardly at a sharp angle, must also twist his/her head toward the side      of that armrest for viewing. Needless to say, even short-term viewing of      the video display of such prior art systems is uncomfortable for the      average size viewer, and prolonged viewing can lead to severe neck      discomfort. Thus, the need remains for a video display which can be stowed      within the armrest of a seat, yet in its use orientation is disposed      generally centrally in front of the viewer and at a convenient height for      the average viewer, thereby to make viewing more comfortable and      pleasurable. </PAR><PAR>  In addition to the prior art systems described above failing to make any      attempt to provide the video display at a comfortable location for      viewing, they fail to provide mechanisms enabling the video display to be      tilted back and forth relative to a vertical plane by pivoting about a      horizontal axis, thereby to further accommodate not only the height of the      average viewer, but also the individual heights of particular viewers (for      example, taller viewers preferring a greater degree of tilt, and average      viewers preferring a lesser degree of tilt). </PAR><PAR>  Because the prior art systems described above position the video display in      use closely adjacent the armrest and relatively remote from a central      location in front of the viewer, the video display does not substantially      limit the ability of the passenger in the seat in an emergency to bend      over and assume the usually recommended crash position or to leave his/her      seat swiftly without taking any special action to remove the video display      from his/her way. Clearly, a system which centrally locates the video      display in front of the viewer would for safety reasons necessarily enable      the passenger to easily and rapidly displace the video display out of the      way as the passenger during an emergency attempted to assume the crash      position or to leave his/her seat, preferably without any particular      attention being paid to the need to displace the video display. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention to provide a video      display assembly wherein the display is movable between a stowed position      within the armrest of the vehicle seat and a use position permitting      comfortable viewing thereof from such seat by an average viewer. </PAR><PAR>  Another object is to provide such an assembly wherein the video display may      be tilted from a generally vertical plane in order to accommodate the      particular height of the viewer. </PAR><PAR>  A further object is to provide such an assembly wherein the video display      may be forcibly displaced from a use position in the event of an emergency      to permit the viewer to take appropriate emergency measures. </PAR><PAR>  It is also an object of the present invention to provide such an assembly      which is simple and economical to manufacture, use and maintain. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It has now been found that the above and related objects of the present      invention are obtained in a novel video display assembly. The novel video      display assembly comprises a video display and a chamber configured and      dimensioned to receive the display when the display is disposed in a first      substantially vertical plane. The display is connected to the chamber by      an arm having a pair of end portions and a shank portion intermediate the      end portions, a proximal one of the end portions being secured to the      chamber and a distal other of the end portions being secured to the      display. The proximal one arm end portion is pivotable in the first      substantially vertical plane relative to the chamber to move the display      between a stow orientation wherein the display is stowed in the chamber      and an intermediate orientation wherein the display is outside of the      chamber. The shank portion is pivotable in a substantially horizontal      plane relative to the proximal one arm end portion to move the display      between the intermediate orientation and a generally vertical use      orientation wherein the display is in a second plane. The distal other arm      end portion is pivotable relative to the shank portion to tilt the display      between the generally vertical use orientation and a tilted use      orientation wherein the display is tilted relative to the second plane for      ease of viewing. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment, the stowable video display is part of an      airplane seat. The proximal one arm end portion is pivotable about a first      substantially horizontal axis, the shank portion is pivotable about a      generally vertical axis, and the distal other arm end portion is pivotable      about a second substantially horizontal axis. The second plane is a      generally vertical plane substantially perpendicular to the first      substantially vertical plane. The shank portion is pivotable relative to      the proximal one arm end through an angle of at least 90.degree., and the      digital other arm end portion is pivotable relative to the shank portion      through an angle of not more than about 30.degree.. The assembly includes      means to limit the angle through which the proximal one arm end portion,      the shank portion and the distal other arm end portion may pivot. The      display is forcibly pivotable from either of the tilted and vertical use      orientations into a breakaway orientation wherein the display is disposed      outside of and entirely below the chamber. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the assembly additionally includes means precluding movement of      the display to the stowed orientation except from the intermediate      orientation. To this end, the assembly includes a pillow block stationary      relative to the chamber and an indexing plate disposed intermediate the      pillow block and the proximal one arm end portion. The indexing plate is      stationary relative to the pillow block under normal use conditions, the      one arm end portion being secured to the indexing plate for rotation      therewith when the display is not in the intermediate orientation. The      indexing plate is forcibly rotatable relative to the pillow block,      although means cooperatively defined by the pillow block and the indexing      plate frictionally resist relative rotation thereof. </PAR><PAR>  Means are provided for independently setting the frictional resistance to      relative rotation between the proximal one arm end portion and the      chamber, between the shank portion and the one arm end portion, and      between the distal other arm end portion and the shank portion. </PAR><PAR>  In one specific embodiment, the assembly is part of a seat, and the chamber      has an open top enabling passage of the display therethrough and includes      an armrest cover removably covering the chamber open top. The cover is      movable between a first position closing the chamber open top and a second      position exposing the chamber open top to permit passage of the display      through the chamber open top. The proximal one arm end portion is      pivotable relative to the chamber through an angle of about 100.degree..      The shank portion is typically of substantial length, preferably at least      6 inches in length. </PAR><PAR>  In another specific embodiment, the assembly is part of a seat, and the      chamber has an open end enabling passage of the display therethrough. The      proximal one arm end portion is pivotable relative to the chamber through      an angle of about 228.degree.. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING </PAC><PAR>  The above and related objects, features and advantages of the present      invention will be more fully understood by reference to the following      detailed description of the presently preferred, albeit illustrative,      embodiments of the present invention when taken in conjecture with the      accompanying drawing wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a side elevational view of an assembly according to a first      embodiment of the present invention mounted in a seat, with the display      being illustrated in the stowed orientation (in dash line), an      intermediate orientation (in dash line), three raised viewing orientations      (a generally vertical one in solid line and two tilted ones in phantom      line), and a lowered breakaway orientation (in solid line), a large man      and small woman being illustrated as a frame of reference, both seated (in      phantom line) and bent over (in dash line); </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a fragmentary isometric view of a row of airplane seats      illustrating the first embodiment in various orientations; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a fragmentary isometric view of an armrest according to the first      embodiment of the present invention, with the armrest cover being      illustrated in an open position and the display being illustrated in an      intermediate position; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a side elevational view, similar to FIG. 3 but with the armrest      cover returned to its normal closed position and the display being      illustrated in a viewing orientation; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a fragmentary side elevational view, partially in cross-section,      taken along the line 5--5 of FIG. 4; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a fragmentary sectional view taken along the line 6--6 of FIG. 5; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a fragmentary sectional view taken along the line 7--7 of FIG. 6; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a fragmentary sectional view taken along the line 8--8 of FIG. 7; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a fragmentary sectional view taken along the line 9--9 of FIG. 8; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is fragmentary a sectional assembly view, to an enlarged scale, of      apparatus according to the first embodiment; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 is a fragmentary exploded isometric view of the pivot arm; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 is a fragmentary sectional view taken along the line 12--12 of FIG.      4; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 13 is a fragmentary top plan view, partially in section, taken along      the line 13--13 of FIG. 12; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 14 is a top plan view of the console; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 15 is a side elevational view taken along the line 15--15 of FIG. 14; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 16 and 17 are isometric views from opposite sides of the display      having a soft cap thereon. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 18 is a side elevational view, similar to FIG. 1, but illustrating      apparatus according to the second embodiment; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 19 is a fragmentary isometric view of a seat illustrating the second      embodiment in a use orientation; </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  Referring now to the drawing, and in particular FIG. 1 thereof, therein      illustrated is a video display assembly, generally designated by the      reference numeral 10, according to a first preferred embodiment of the      present invention. The video display assembly 10 is part of a seat      generally designated 12, having a bottom 14, a back 16, and at least one      armrest 18. The back 16 of the seat 12 may optionally be movable between      an upright position (as illustrated) and a tilted or reclining position.      As a frame of reference, a superimposed male FIG. 20 and female FIG. 22      are illustrated in a seated position (in phantom line), with the same      figures being illustrated in a bent-over position (in dash line), as might      be assumed by the passenger in the event of an emergency according to      instructions by the vehicle operator. The seat 12 is illustrated as      supported on the floor 24 of the vehicle by conventional braces and      supports 26, which may include an adjustable footrest 28. Although the      present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to a      vehicle seat, and in particular an airplane seat (although similar seats      may be employed on trains, and the like), it should be appreciated that      the floor 24 may be any floor, whether of a vehicle or not. As illustrated      in FIG. 2, a plurality of seats 12a, 12b may be disposed to form a row,      with seat 12b at the right of FIG. 2 being identical to seat 12a at the      left thereof except that the armrest 18 is disposed on the opposite side      thereof, the particular side being selected to accommodate the seating      arrangement in the row. A control panel 25 (see FIG. 3), pockets and the      like may optionally be disposed on the exterior surface of armrest 18 as      well. </PAR><PAR>  Referring still to FIG. 1 in particular, as a brief overview of the      operation of the present invention, the video display assembly unit 10      includes a video display 30 which is typically a conventional small      television set, such as a five inch diagonal liquid crystal display (LCD)      unit. The video display 30 in its stowed orientation is disposed in a      chamber 32 configured and dimensioned to receive the display 30 when the      display is disposed in a first substantially vertical plane (as indicated      in dashed line). As best seen in FIG. 3, the chamber 32 has an open top 34      enabling passage of the display 30 therethrough and includes an armrest      cover 36 which is pivotable, as indicated by the double headed arrow 37,      between a chamber opening orientation, wherein passage of the display 30      through the chamber open top 34 is enabled (as illustrated in FIG. 3), and      a chamber closing orientation, wherein the cover 36 covers and thereby      closes the chamber open top 34 and serves as an armrest cover upon which      the passenger may rest his arm or elbow, regardless of whether or not the      display 30 is within or without the chamber 32 (as illustrated in FIGS. 1,      2 and 4). </PAR><PAR>  The display 30 is secured to the seat 12, and more particularly to the      chamber 32, by means of an elbow or pivot arm generally designated 40 and      curved substantially in the form of a right angle. The pivot arm 40 has a      pair of linear end portions 42, 44 and a curved shank or bight portion 46      intermediate and connecting the end portions 42, 44. The proximal end      portion 42 is pivotally secured relative to the chamber 32, and the distal      end portion 44 is secured to the display 30. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now in particular to FIG. 3, the proximal arm end portion 42 is      pivotable in a first substantially vertical plane relative to the chamber      32, as illustrated by the double headed arrow 51, to move the display 30      between a stowed orientation wherein the display 30 is stowed in the      chamber 32 (as illustrated in FIG. 5 and in dash line in FIG. 1) and a      generally vertical intermediate orientation wherein the display 30 is      disposed outside of the chamber 32 (as illustrated in dash line in FIG. 1,      in phantom line in FIG. 5, and on seat 12a of FIG. 2). The pivot pin 50,      about which the arm 40 pivots, is disposed in the upper front corner of      the chamber 32. Referring now also to FIG. 4, the shank portion 46 of the      pivot arm 40 is pivotable in a substantially horizontal plane relative to      the proximal arm end portion 42, as indicated by double headed arrow 54,      between the aforementioned intermediate orientation and a vertical use      orientation wherein the display 30 is in a second plane (as illustrated in      FIG. 4, in FIG. 2 attached to seat 12a, and in FIG. 1 by dash lines above      the chamber 32). Referring back to FIG. 1 especially, the distal arm end      portion 44 adjacent display 30 is pivotable relative to the shank portion      46, as indicated by double headed arrow 54, to tilt the display 30 between      the aforementioned generally vertical use orientation and a tilted use      orientation wherein the display is tilted relative to the second plane for      ease of viewing. (In FIG. 1, the extreme tilted positions of the display      30 are indicated at one extreme in solid line and in the other extreme in      phantom line.) </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the proximal arm end portion 42 is pivotable relative to the      chamber through an angle of about 100.degree. so that, when it has been      moved from the stowed orientation to the intermediate orientation, it is      inclined to the vertical by only about 10.degree.. Further, the shank      portion 46 is pivotable relative to the proximal arm end portion 42      through an angle of about 90.degree., this being adequate to bring the      display 30 so that it faces the seated passenger. Finally, the distal arm      end portion 44 is pivotable relative to the shank portion 46 through an      angle of not more than about 30.degree., this being adequate to tilt the      display 30 from the second plane to the degree necessary to accommodate      normal variations in the height of the viewer (about 15.degree. in either      direction) </PAR><PAR>  Viewed another way, in order to view the display, the armrest cover 36 is      opened (see arrow 37 of FIG. 4). Then the proximal arm end portion 42 is      pivoted about a first substantially horizontal axis (the axis being      defined by the horizontally disposed pivot pin 50) to enable the display      30 to be brought out of the compartment 32 wherein it is normally stowed      (see arrow 51 of FIG. 3). Then the shank portion 46 is pivoted about a      generally vertical axis (defined by the proximal arm end portion 42) in      order to swing the display 30 from a generally vertical plane transverse      to the viewer (and aligned with the plane of chamber 32) into a generally      vertical plane parallel to and in front of the viewer (see arrow 52 of      FIG. 4). Because the shank portion 46 is of substantial length and is at      least partially offset from the axis of the proximal arm end portion 42,      the pivoting of the shank portion 46 relative to the proximal arm end      portion 42 brings the display 30 not merely generally parallel to the      passenger, but also into a position which is laterally centered relative      to the seat (and hence the seated passenger). This permits the passenger      to look ahead at the display 30 without having to turn his head laterally      in the direction of the compartment 32. Finally, the distal arm end      portion 44 is pivoted about a second substantially horizontal axis      (defined by the adjacent portion of the shank portion 46) in order to      permit the display 30 to be tilted relative to the generally vertical      plane (see arrow 54 of FIG. 1). This tilting of the display 30 enables the      plane of its viewing face or screen to be brought generally into a      parallel disposition with the main plane of the passenger's face, thereby      to facilitate viewing of the display 30 despite some variation in the      height of the passenger. </PAR><PAR>  Completing the description of the basic operation of the arm 40, in the      event of an emergency or in order to enable passengers to take precautions      in anticipation of an emergency, the display 30 can be quickly and easily      displaced from either the generally vertical use orientation or the tilted      use orientation (and in fact even from the intermediate orientation) into      the breakaway or breakover orientation (illustrated in FIG. 1 in solid      line adjacent the bottom of the seat 12), as indicated by double headed      arrow 55, thereby to allow the passenger 20, 22 (illustrated upright in      phantom line) to assume the bent-over emergency position (illustrated in      dash line). Further, the passenger 20, 22 can easily leave his seat since      the display 30, moved into the breakover orientation from the intermediate      orientation, does not block the passenger from rising to his/her feet, and      the display 30, moved into the breakover position from the generally      vertical or tilted use orientations, may initially extend across the feet      of the passenger, but is easily re-oriented (using either the hand or      foot) into a non-blocking orientation (wherein the display 30 is in the      same substantially vertical plane as the display 30 in the stowed      orientation). </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIGS. 5-11, the proximal end portion 42 of the pivot arm      40 is pivotably mounted on main pivot pin 50. The proximal end portion 42      of the pivot arm 40 is commonly referred to as a pivot housing 60, as it      enables the arm 40 to pivot about to the main pivot pin 50. Also mounted      on the main pivot pin 50 is a pillow block 62, the pillow block being made      a fixed (i.e., non-pivotable) part of the seat 12 by a screw 63. An      indexing plate 64 is also mounted on the main pivot pin 50 intermediate      the pillow block 62 and pivot housing 60 via an internal coaxial washer      65, e.g., made of Delrin. The pillow block 62 is under compression, and      the threaded Portion of the main pivot pin 50 extending through the      internally threaded aperture of the pivot housing 60 is in tension, with      the coaxial friction washer 65 being used as a friction surface between      the pillow block 62 and the pivot housing 60. A torque or lock nut 66 on      main pivot pin 50, adjacent the surface of the pillow block 62 remote from      the indexing plate 64, is used to adjust the degree of friction between      the pillow block 62 and pivot housing 60. </PAR><PAR>  In order to limit the motion of the pivot arm 40 so that under normal      circumstances it moves the display 30 only between the stowed orientation      and the intermediate orientation, the indexing plate 64 defines an arcuate      slot 70 which receives a non-retractable pin 72 from the pivot housing 60,      such that the pin 72 can traverse an angle of about 100.degree., thereby      allowing the pivot housing 60 to rotate 100.degree. relative to the      indexing plate 64, as necessary to move the video display 30 between its      stowed orientation within chamber 32 and its generally vertical      intermediate orientation outside of chamber 32. </PAR><PAR>  The indexing plate 64 additionally defines an arcuate breakover slot 74      which receives therethrough a bolt 76 extending from the pillow block 62.      A nut 78 is fastened to the protruding end of the bolt 76 and is tightened      so that the traverse of the bolt 78 along the breakover slot 74 is      characterized by added friction between the adjacent surfaces of the nut      78 and the indexing plate 64 about the breakover slot 74. The breakover      slot 74 permits movement of the bolt 76 over an angle of 135.degree.,      thereby enabling the display 30 to be moved from its generally vertical or      tilted use orientation downwardly to its breakover orientation when      sufficient force is exerted by the passenger to overcome the additional      friction involved in movement of the bolt 76 relative to the breakover      slot 74, thus enabling the indexing plate 64 to move relative to the      pillow block 62. The ability to move the display 30 to the breakover      orientation further reduces the possibility of damage either to the      display 30 itself or to the passenger in the event that under turbulent      conditions the passenger (and particularly the passenger's head) strikes      the display 30. It will be appreciated that the indexing plate 64, while      stationary relative to the pillow block 62 under normal use conditions, is      pivotable relative thereto through a predetermined angle (preferably      135.degree.) under breakover conditions where additional force is used      over that used during normal deployment of the pivot arm 40. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIGS. 6-7 and 10-11 in particular, the shank portion 56 of      pivot arm 40 is preferably at least 6 inches in length (along its curved      center axis) and defines a sleeve 79 adjacent its functional abutment with      the pillow block 60 for partial receipt therein of a cylinder generally      designated 80. The cylinder 80 defines a cylindrical proximal portion 82,      an intermediate shoulder portion 83 of enlarged diameter, and a gently      tapered distal portion 85 adapted to be at least partially disposed within      the sleeve 79. The cylinder 80 is pivotably mounted on a threaded shaft 90      integral with the pivot housing 60 and extending outwardly therefrom at a      right angle to the main pivot pin 50. A torque or locking nut 92 secured      to the end of shaft 90 maintains the cylinder 80 on shaft 90. In order to      maintain the tapered distal portion 85 of cylinder 80 within the sleeve 79      of the shaft portion 46 of the pivot arm 40, an internally threaded slip      ring 86 is threaded onto the externally threaded end of the sleeve 79,      with the radially outwardly extending shoulder 83 of the cylinder 80      becoming trapped between a radially inwardly extending shoulder 87 of the      slip ring 86 and the end of the shaft portion 46. It will be appreciated      that the slip ring 86 can be rotated in one direction to draw the shaft      portion 46 and the cylinder 80 together or reversely rotated in order to      separate the two elements and thereby expose the torque or lock nut 92 for      adjustment. A key 81 is partially disposed both in a key slot of cylinder      distal portion 85 and in a key slot of the sleeve 79 to provide a link      between the sleeve 79 and cylinder 80 which precludes relative pivoting of      the sleeve and cylinder, thereby ensuring that, as the pivot arm shank      portion 46 is rotated, the cylinder 80 is rotated therewith. </PAR><PAR>  An unthreaded pawl ring 88 defines a radially extending pawl 84 and mates      with the cylindrical proximal portion 82 of cylinder 80. One of the      opposing surfaces defining a key 95a, and the other of the opposing      surfaces defining a keyway 95b, so that the pawl ring 88 and cylinder 80      are joined for rotation together as a unit. As best illustrated in FIG.      11, the distal surface of the pawl ring 88 defines a pair of keys 95a and      the proximal surface of the cylinder 80 defines the keyway 95b which      engagingly receives the keys of the pawl ring 88. Accordingly, rotation of      the shaft portion 46 is transmitted (via the key 81) to the cylinder 80      and hence the pawl ring 88. The pawl ring 88 is disposed within a recess      (see FIG. 6) on the distal end of the pivot housing 60 coaxially with the      shaft 90. As best seen in FIG. 9, the arcuate channel 89 limits rotation      of the pawl 84 and hence the shank portion 46 (via the pawl ring 88,      cylinder 80, and key 81) to a predetermined angle of at least 90 .degree.,      and preferably 90.degree.-135.degree.. </PAR><PAR>  It will be appreciated that while the ability of the pivot arm shank      portion 46 to pivot relative to the pivot housing 60 plays an important      role in enabling the display 30 to be brought into a convenient viewing      portion, it also introduces a problem in that the shank portion 46 must be      returned to its original position if the display 30 is to be properly      aligned with the open top of the compartment 32, as necessary to enable      the display 30 to be subsequently moved to its stowed orientation. As a      solution to this problem, means are provided for precluding stowing of the      display 30 (or even pivoting of the pivot housing 60 relative to the main      pivot pin 50) under normal conditions until the shank portion 46 has been      returned to its original orientation. Referring now also to FIGS. 8 and 9,      a retractable pin 100 is biased by a spring 102 to project outwardly from      the pivot housing 60 into the aperture 104 of indexing plate 64, as      illustrated in FIG. 8. Since indexing plate 64 is stationary during normal      use, the pivot housing 60 is thus precluded from rotation about the main      pivot pin 50. However, as the shank portion 46 (and hence the cylinder 80      and pawl ring 88) is rotated so that the display 30 enters the proper      orientation for being stowed within the chamber 32, the radially outwardly      extending pawl 84 of pawl ring 88 traveling in arcuate channel 89 contacts      and eventually displaces a lever 106 which is pivotably secured at 108 to      the retractable pin 100. As the lever 106 is pivoted about its pivot point      110 by the pawl 84, it withdraws the retractable pin 100 from aperture 104      of the indexing plate 64, thus enabling the pivot housing 60 to rotate      relative to the main pivot pin 50 as necessary for stowing of the display      30 within the chamber 32. </PAR><PAR>  It will be understood that while the presence of the retractable pin 100 in      the aperture 104 of indexing plate 64 precludes pivotal movement of the      pivot housing 60 relative to the indexing plate 64, when it is desired to      rotate the pivot housing 60 relative to the pillow block 62 to enable the      display 30 to enter the breakover orientation, the same may be      accomplished by the passenger using the additional force required to      overcome the additional friction existing between pillow block 62 and      indexing plate 64, thereby enabling indexing plate 64 to be pivoted with      pivot housing 60 relative to stationary pillow block 62. The additional      force supplied must, of course, be sufficient to overcome the friction      applied between indexing plate 74 and nut 78, which friction tends to      maintain the indexing plate stationary--that is, non-rotatable relative to      the pillow block 62. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIGS. 11-13, the video display 30 is mounted on the distal      end portion 44 of the pivot arm 40 for rotation therewith. As the distal      end portion 44 supports the display or monitor 30, it is commonly called a      monitor base. An externally threaded shaft 120 projects outwardly from the      distal end of shank portion 46 of pivot arm 40, projects into and through      a portion of monitor base 44, and is secured thereto by a torque or lock      nut 122. More particularly, shaft 120 defines an enlarged cylindrical      portion 124 disposed within an internally threaded sleeve 126 on the      proximal end of the monitor base 44. A cap screw 130 is affixed to the      cylinder 124 for rotation therewith, typically after the cylinder 124 is      inserted into the sleeve 126 of the monitor base 44. The sleeve 126      defines stops 132 which limit the rotation of the cap screw 130 (and hence      the monitor base 44) to 30.degree. relative to the shaft portion 46. The      tightness of torque or locking nut 122 on the end of shaft 120 determines      the ease with which the display 30 may be tilted, and is preferably      relatively high to preclude unintentional movement once the desired tilt      is achieved. </PAR><PAR>  It will be appreciated that no precautions are taken to insure that display      30 is in an upright (that is, untilted) position relative to the shank      portion 46 before the display 30 can be stowed in chamber 32. As there is      only possible a 15.degree. deviation from the upright or normal (i.e.,      untilted) orientation, the sides of the chamber 32 bearing on the main      surfaces of the display 30 appropriately orient the display 30 as      necessary for stowage during entry of the display 30 into chamber 32. </PAR><PAR>  It will be appreciated by those skilled in the mechanical arts that in      order to prevent unintended or loose movement of the elements of the      present invention, the pivot joints afford varying degrees of frictional      resistance. Thus, as best seen in FIG. 11, a torque or locking nut 66 is      used on the main pivot pin 50 to maintain the pivot housing 60 and pillow      block 62 pressed tightly together (via friction washer 65) to resist      rotation of the pivot housing 60 under normal use conditions, while still      permitting relative movement therebetween. (Nut 78 is used to resist      relative rotation of indexing plate 64 and pillow block 62 unless      additional force is intentionally applied to achieve (or recover from) a      breakaway orientation.) Similarly, the torque or locking nut 122 provides      frictional resistance between the monitor base 44 and shaft portion 46 to      limit unintentional tilting of the display 30. In both instances the      additional frictional resistance afforded by the torque or locking nut 66,      122 is desirable since there is a gravitational component tending to move      the display 30. On the other hand, gravity does not tend to move the      display 30 between its intermediate vertical orientation and its vertical      use orientation, and thus there is required only the relatively slight      frictional resistance provided by the torque or locking nut 92. Each of      these torque or locking nuts 66, 92, 122 can be independently adjusted to      provide a desired level of frictional resistance to pivotal motion for      particular joints. </PAR><PAR>  The display 30 receives its audiovisual signals and power by means of a      cable 160 which passes through the main pivot pin 50, shaft 90, shank      portion 46, shaft 120, and the monitor base 44 into display 30. </PAR><PAR>  As is customary in the mechanical arts, friction washers 162 composed of a      linear polyoxymethylene-type sealant resin, such as that available under      the tradename Delrin, are interposed between metal surfaces which may      rotate relative to each other so as to minimize wear of the metal parts. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIGS. 11 and 14-15, the assembly of the present invention      is typically part of a console generally designated 170, that is mounted      as a unit to one or more seats in a row and secured thereto by screws 172      engaging the mounting base 174 thereof. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIGS. 16 and 17 in particular, a soft cap 180 is secured      to the top of the display 30, for example, by an adhesive, in order to      provide cushioning in the event that the passenger (and in particular the      head of the passenger) strikes the top of the display 30. The cap 180 is      configured and dimensioned so as to facilitate maintenance of the display      30, for example, to permit replacement of a lamp 182 (illustrated in      phantom line in a partial removed orientation) which is normally disposed      behind the LCD screen in order to provide better illumination thereof. The      cap is formed of a suitable soft material, for example, a plastic or      rubber such as polyurethane. </PAR><PAR>  For the most part, the assembly is composed of aluminum for an appropriate      combination of weight and strength, although other strong, lightweight      materials may be used. The various nuts 66, 78, 92, 122, the various      shafts 50, 90, 120, and the key 81 are preferably formed of steel in order      to provide additional strength. The various washers 65, 162 are preferably      formed of a linear polyoxymethylene-type sealant resin, such as that      available under the tradename Delrin. The soft cap 180 is preferably      formed of polyurethane. </PAR><PAR>  In the first embodiment 10 illustrated in FIGS. 1-17, the display 30 is      movable from its stowed position within the compartment 32 upwardly and      outwardly through the open top thereof into its use orientation. The      compartment 32 occupies the major portion of the armrest 18, as necessary      to accommodate not only the display 30 but also the relatively large size      pivotal arm 40 necessary to enable display 30 to be brought into a      convenient viewing orientation. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIGS. 18 and 19, therein illustrated is a second      embodiment 10' of the present invention wherein the display 30' is moved      from its stowed orientation within a compartment 32' outwardly and      upwardly through the front end (as opposed to the top) of the compartment      32' into its use orientation. As indicated in FIG. 18, the display 30',      when moved between its stowed orientation and the generally vertical      orientation, travels about 228.5.degree., as illustrated by the double      added arrow 201. The pivot arm 40' is necessarily substantially shorter      than pivot arm 40 of the first embodiment (2.5 v. 6.7 inches), so that the      pivot arm 40' and display 30' can fit into a much shorter compartment 32'.      This permits the rear portion of armrest 18' to house a video tape      cassette player within the armrest 18'. Thus the passenger can bring his      own video tapes with him and, by inserting them into opening 200 of the      tape cassette player, view them on the display 30'. Alternatively, this      extra space may be used for other optional items which could be requested      by airline customers (i.e., an amenities pocket). </PAR><PAR>  Because the display 30' does not enter and leave the compartment 32'      through the top thereof, the armrest cover 36' may be stationary rather      than pivotable. However since the display 30' is more prone to being      accidentally displaced from compartment 32' of the second embodiment      through the front end thereof than display 30' was likely to be      accidentally displaced upwardly against gravity through the top of the      compartment 32 of the first embodiment, suitable latching means 202 are      provided to secure the display 30 within the compartment 32' against      accidental displacement. </PAR><PAR>  It will be appreciated that the arcuate slot 70 of the indexing plate 64      must be lengthened and relocated in the second embodiment to enable the      greater angle of travel of the display between its stowed orientation and      its generally vertical orientation (228.5.degree. as opposed to      110.degree.). All internal mechanisms of the second embodiment 10' are      otherwise identical to the corresponding mechanisms of the first      embodiment 10' although exterior surfaces may vary somewhat for aesthetic      reasons or to enable proper interfacing with the seat. </PAR><PAR>  While the second embodiment does not enable the display 30' to be      positioned in the exact same in use location as the first embodiment, it      still permits the display 30' to be positioned well above the seat armrest      18 and well across the seat (toward the center thereof) as necessary to      facilitate viewing thereof. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, the present invention allows the center point of the video display      thereof (assuming the same to be a five inch LCD) to be elevated above the      axis of the main pivot pin about 15 inches in the first embodiment 10 and      about 10 inches in the second embodiment 10'. This enables the top of the      display to be at about shoulder level for the average female and slightly      lower for the average male, when the passenger is seated upright. However,      it must be considered that, as a seat is moved into a reclining      orientation, the shoulder lever (and thus the eye level) of the passenger      is lower accordingly. On the other hand, while there is a significant      difference between the first and second embodiments in terms of how high      the display is elevated above the main pivot pin (and thus the armrest of      the seat), there is very little difference between the two embodiments in      how far the pivot arm brings the display from the armrest across the      passenger (thereby to center the display for viewing). The center point of      the display is displaced from the intersection of the pivot arm and the      main pivot pin laterally about 7 inches in the first embodiment 10 and      about 6 inches in the second embodiment 10'. As the seat width typically      varies according to the passenger class on an airplane, in some instances      such a lateral displacement is sufficient to bring the display at least      partially across the passenger's torso, while in other instances it may      only bring the display at least partially across the passenger's arm. </PAR><PAR>  To summarize, the present invention provides a video display assembly      wherein the display is movable between a stowed position within the      armrest of the vehicle seat and a use position permitting comfortable      viewing thereof from such u seat by an average viewer. The video display      may be tilted from a generally vertical plane to accommodate the height of      the viewer and may be forcibly displaced from its use position in the      event of an emergency to permit the viewer to take appropriate emergency      measures. The assembly is simple and economical to manufacture, use and      maintain. </PAR><PAR>  Now that the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown      and described in detail, various modifications and improvements thereon      will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the      spirit and scope of the present invention is to be construed broadly and      limited only by the appended claims, and not by the foregoing      specification. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
