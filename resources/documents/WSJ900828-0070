Without it, Mr. Duran said,many would fold.</LP><TEXT>   Latino publications depend on tobacco, alcohol andfast-food advertising because many other companies don't seeHispanics as important consumers, said Alfredo J. Estrada,editor and publisher of Hispanic magazine. &quot;Many companiesview them as being poor,&quot; said Mr. Estrada. &quot;It's hard forthem to realize there are Hispanic professionals.&quot;   Community activists and lawmakers, citing higher levels ofdiseases associated with smoking and drinking among blacksand Latinos, are pushing to rein in companies thataggressively pitch tobacco and alcohol to those groups.   A report by the Center for Science in the Public Interest,a nonprofit advocacy group for public-health policies, titled&quot;Marketing Disease to Hispanics&quot; criticized Hispanic groupsfor taking advertising revenue and charitable donations fromthe tobacco, alcohol and junk-food industries in the face ofrising health problems among Hispanics.   The center's report said Mexican-American men are 40% morelikely to die from cirrhosis of the liver than white men. Thedeath rate from adult diabetes for Mexican-Americans in theSouthwest is double that of whites, the center said. And theincidence of cancer among Hispanics is also on the rise.Meanwhile, the study notes, tobacco, alcohol and junk-foodadvertising to Hispanic communities is increasing. The reportparallels earlier findings on blacks.   At the forum earlier this month, Hispanic mediaprofessionals gave a collective thumbs-down to congressionalefforts to restrain alcohol and tobacco advertising in U.S.publications. The Hispanics also lambasted the report fromthe Center for Science in the Public Interest. Mr. Durancalled the study racially paternalistic, saying it impliesthat Hispanic consumers must be protected because they aren'tsmart enough to know better.   Ernest Bromley, president of Sosa andamp; Associates, SanAntonio, Texas, one of the largest Hispanic advertisingagencies in the country, called the 100-page report &quot;yellowjournalism&quot; for implying that Hispanic organizations have&quot;sold out&quot; to the corporate dollar.   The media representatives argued that attempts to restrictadvertising infringe on freedom of speech, the position takenby tobacco, alcohol and fast-food companies. &quot;I don't wantthe great white father leading the Hispanic to the propercourse,&quot; said Mr. Duran. He scoffs at the report's suggestionthat ads from such ubiquitous marketers as Coca-Cola andMcDonald's be banned, asking, &quot;Why don't they censor Jello?&quot;   The U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce also opposes theadvertising restrictions. That group is lobbying to defeat abill that would allow each state to regulate tobacco ads.Jose Nino, president of the Hispanic chamber, said such abill, if passed, would have an &quot;extremely severe&quot; impact onthe Hispanic population by depriving Hispanics of &quot;thousands&quot;of jobs in the advertising and publications field.   Some Hispanic groups, most notably the National Coalitionof Hispanic Health and Human Services Organizations, supportthe idea of restricted advertising and a ban on donations.&quot;If they are marketing a product that kills our youths, weshould look elsewhere {for money},&quot; said Dr. Jane Delgado,president of the nonprofit Hispanic health coalition. Thecoalition never has taken money from tobacco companies, andthree years ago it stopped accepting donations from thealcohol industry.   Debate at the forum, called specifically to address theadvertising issue, spilled over into talk about donationsmade by alcohol, tobacco and fast-food companies to nonprofitHispanic organizations. Mr. Estrada of Hispanic magazine saidthe study's recommendations would have a &quot;chilling effect&quot; oncorporations that have provided scholarships and educationalprograms to the Hispanic community.   Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center forScience in the Public Interest and co-author of the report,said many Hispanic groups have had to rely more and more ondonations from corporations since federal funds for socialprograms were slashed during the Reagan administration. Butsuch gifts have strings attached, Mr. Jacobson charges. &quot;Theywant something in return,&quot; he said. &quot;They want silence, ifnot advocates.&quot;   The National Council of La Raza, the nation's largestLatino advocacy organization, accepts donations from tobacco,alcohol and food companies, but maintains there's no problemwith doing so.   &quot;The total amount of money we get from alcohol and tobaccocompanies amounts to 1% or 2%&quot; of the organization's totalannual budget, says Raul Yzaguirre, president of the council,&quot;so they are hardly in a position to influence us.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
