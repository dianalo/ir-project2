Michak, Office of ProgramDevelopment, OCHAMPUS, telephone (303) 361-4078.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In FR Doc. 77-7834, appearing in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 4, 1977 (42 FR 17972), the Office ofthe Secretary of Defense published its regulation, DoD 6010.8-R, ``Implementationof the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS),''as Part 199 of this title. 32 CFR Part 199 (DoD 6010.8-R) was reissuedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 1, 1986 (51 FR 24008). In FR Doc. 87017277 appearing in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 31, 1987 (51 FR 285 68), the Office ofthe Secretary of Defense published for public comment a notice of proposedrulemaking regarding mental health counselors. The following summarizesthe comments received and the actions we have taken based upon these comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>We received 9 timely items of correspondence in response to the proposednotice. Of these, 7 were from professional associations and 2 were fromindividual health professionals. The comments were generally supportiveof the decision to recognize certified mental health as CHAMPUS-authorizedproviders of mental health services. One opposition to the proposed coverageof mental health counselors was received. A summary of the comments andour responses to them follows.A. Opposition to Coverage<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter was opposed to the coverage of mental healthcounselors because mental health counselors do not have sufficient education,training and experience to provide care to the mentally ill, and the majorityof states do not credential mental health counselors through state licensure.<T3>Response: </T3>We do not find the commenters arguments against coveragepersuasive. We have determined that certified clinical mental health counselorsmeeting the CHAMPUS criteria for education, experience, and licensure arequalified to provide otherwise covered mental health services.B. Physician Referral<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommend that the requirement for physicianreferral and supervision be deleted.<T3>Response: </T3>A demonstration on the issue of physician referral andsupervision for marriage and family counselors was initiated by CHAMPUSon December 1, 1987. It would not be appropriate to make decisions on thatissue until the results of the demonstration are available. There is alsoan existing requirement in the law (Chapter 55, title 10, U.S.C.) requiringphysician referral and supervision of services provided by marital, childand family, and pastoral counselors.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that a psychiatrist must be thereferring physician.<T3>Response: </T3>We do not agree. There is no requirement for treatmentby a specialist under CHAMPUS and referral by any physician is acceptable.We are concerned that a patient is adequately evaluated and diagnosed priorto referral to an extramedical provider for treatment of a mental disorder.That does not require the services of a psychiatrist. Title 10, of chapter55, of the United States Code states that this referral must be by a medicaldoctor.C. Licensure<T3>Comment: </T3>There were several comments recommending that the licensureor certification requirements be changed to read as follows: ``is licensedto practice as a mental health counselor by the jurisdiction where practicing.''<T3>Response: </T3>We agree and have included similar language in thisfinal rule.<T3>Comment: </T3>There was a comment that the regulatory language includea statement about the requirement for certification by an appropriate nationalprofessional association in the absence of state licensure.<T3>Response: </T3>Similar language has been added for clarification.D. Rehabilitation Counseling<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters asked for clarification on rehabilitationcounseling.<T3>Response: </T3>In the notice of proposed rulemaking, we stated thatCHAMPUS will cost-share otherwise covered mental health services providedby mental health counselors, but that vocational, rehabilitation, or socio-economiccounseling would not be covered. The statement was added to clarify thatCHAMPUS would limit its coverage to otherwise covered mental health servicesas provided by mental health counselors. Rehabilitation counseling is notlisted as a covered mental health service.<T3>Comment: </T3>There were several recommendations that CHAMPUS recognizerehabilitation counselors.<T3>Response:</T3> This rule was specifically limited to certified clinicalmental health counselors. Although certified rehabilitation counselorsare not listed as CHAMPUS-authorized providers, otherwise covered servicesby a certified rehabilitation counselor may be considered when the counselormeets existing requirements for another category of provider such as thecategory for marriage and family, pastoral, and mental health counselors.E. Peer Review<T3>Comment:</T3> There was an objection to the continued use of the fiscalintermediary medical review rather than peer review from the same providergroup for mental health services by counselors.<T3>Response:</T3> We do not plan to make any changes to the existing requirementsfor review of mental health claims by marriage, family, pastoral and mentalhealth counselors at this time. There is a requirement that whenever possible,the medical review should be done by an individual with a medical specialtyappropriate to the care and services in question. F. Separate Categories<T3>Comment:</T3> Several organizations recommended that a separate categorybe established for each type of counselor.<T3>Response:</T3> We do not see an advantage to making totally separatecategories. There are some provisions, such as the requirement for physicianreferral and supervision, that apply to all of these categories. Wherethere are separate and unique requirements, we have identified those.<T3>Comment:</T3> There were several comments on the issue of placementin the category of extramedical versus the allied health category for marriageand family counselors as well as mental health counselors.<T3>Response:</T3> Allied health providers can provide services independentof physician referral and supervision, extramedical providers cannot. Untilthe results of the demonstration project are completed and the CHAMPUSlaw changes, we must continue to place counselors it the extramedical category.As stated in the notice of proposed rulemaking, the following professionalbenefits are payable when rendered in the diagnosis or treatment of a coveredmental disorder by a CHAMPUS-authorized, qualified mental health providerpracticing within the scope of his or her license:a. Individual psychotherapy;b. Group psychotherapy;c. Family or conjoint psychotherapy;d. Psychoanalysis;e. Psychological testing and assessment;f. Administration of psychotropic drugs;g. Electroconvulsive treatment; and h. Collateral visits.Counseling services that are not medically necessary in the treatment ofa diagnosed medical condition; for example, educational counseling, vocationalcounseling, and counseling for socio-economic purposes are not covered.In this rule, mental health counselors meeting specific educational andexperience requirements are included as qualified mental health providersunder the referral and supervision of a physician. In the absence of statelicensure, the mental health counselor must be certified by, or be eligiblefor, membership in a CHAMPUS-approved national association that sets standardsfor mental health counselors equivalent to or greater that those requiredby CHAMPUS.CHAMPUS has established utilization review guidelines review requirementsfor specific diagnoses and treatment modalities, all outpatient mentalhealth services are reviewed by third level (peer) review at the 48th session,and all inpatient case at the 30th day. Like marriage and family counselorsand pastoral counselors, all mental health counselor claims will be reviewedat the established review points by the CHAMPUS Fiscal Intermediaries.This amendment also clarifies the existing CHAMPUS requirement for physicalreferral and supervision for services provided by paramedical providersand certain extramedical providers.Although there are approximately 1,000 Certified Clinical Mental HealthCounselors who would potentially meet the requirements of this final rule,only a small number of these counselors will likely apply to CHAMPUS approval.There are approximately 100,000 CHAMPUS beneficiaries who utilize mentalhealth services. Attending physicians and psychiatrists now provide morethan 50 percent of these services while extramedical counselors provideapproximately 0.2 percent. The average amount paid by the government foran outpatient visit provided by an extramedical counselor is approximately$44. We would anticipate that less than 1 percent of the CHAMPUS user beneficiarieswill use mental health counselors. Because of the small number of CHAMPUSbeneficiaries who will potentially use mental health counselors, and thelimited amount paid for an outpatient visit, the net impact on the averagemental health counselor will not be significant. Accordingly, the Secretarycertifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 199</ITAG>Claims, Handicapped, Health insurance, Military personnel.Accordingly, 32 CFR, Part 199 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 199_[AMENDED]</ITAG>The authority citation for Part 199 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 10 U.S.C. 1079, 1086, 5 U.S.C. 301.</ITAG>2.
