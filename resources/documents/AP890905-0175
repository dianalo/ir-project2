It is as simpleas that,'' says Dumont, whose 32 books make that point in chillingdetail.   A French agronomist turned agitator-advocate for the planet atlarge, Dumont still evokes sly smiles among countrymen used to hiswhite hair, red sweater and green politics.   At 85, Dumont spends more time in France before small provincialaudiences than television cameras. But abroad, his colleagues nowsee him as a prophet whose cries in the wilderness should have beenheard.   ``The prophetic nature of his vision is spectacular,'' wroteLloyd Timberlake, an American environmentalist, in a preface to afresh edition of Dumont's classic ``False Start in Africa.''   Dumont, Timberlake added, remains ``an eccentric, a gadfly, anagent provocateur in the very best sense of the word.''   Dumont trots the globe collecting honorary doctorates andspeaking. He scrambles for early flights on hectic schedules. But henever misses his nap, even if it means stretching out in a crowdedroom.   He is cheered on, now that environmental issues are finallyreaching summit conference agendas. ``It's coming,'' he says,eyebrows bristling like mystic antennae. ``It's coming.''   At a recent panel in Spain, Timberlake picked up a main themeDumont has hammered away at for decades: Careless, needless emissionof gases threatens catastrophic weather changes.   ``Look at Africa,'' said Dumont, his words rising to a crescendo.``First we stole their labor, then we stole their primary products,and now we are stealing their weather.''   In a not-too-distant future, he warned, everyone else is next.   Dumont clutched his notes and flailed at unseen culprits withthem. His eyes, twinkling at irony and burning at punch lines,suggested he might leap up and convert words to action.   In the small apartment at the edge of Paris where he once thoughthe'd retire, he expands on the point more calmly.   ``Everyone blames aerosol sprays, but the problem is automobiles,carbon dioxide emissions,'' he says. ``We keep on as if there isnothing wrong, no danger, no urgency. What madness.''   With new evidence, he stresses constant themes: Education, thestatus of women, population control, fair trade and development areas vital to saving the world as scientific remedies.   Poverty, desperation and ignorance cause ecological plunder, hesays, but greed and extravagance cause much more.   ``We waste half the energy we produce,'' he says. ``And we arekilling ourselves. It is suicide.''   The difference between Dumont and most others who deliver thatmessage is that he's watched it happen up close, since his fathertaught him about agriculture in post-World War I France.   ``I studied agriculture because you have to understand the worldto change it,'' he says. ``Rather than focusing on a neighborhood inFrance, I looked at the whole world. But it is the same thing.''   As a colonial officer in Indochina in 1934, he wrote a book aboutrice that also told how officials destroyed 500,000 tons of rice tobolster the price of French wheat.   That set a life-long pattern. Mingling hard truths about officialincompetence with scientific wisdom, Dumont left both devotedfollowers and bitter enemies in his wake.   He repeatedly sacrificed comfortable government posts for theright to speak out. In the early 1960s, as most of Africa broke intosmall independent nations, Dumont took a customary hard look.   He saw European economists encouraging Africans to produce exportcrops at cheap prices, laying waste to fragile lands whileneglecting farmers they depended upon for food.   He noticed young African men swelling inept bureaucracies whilewomen, left unschooled in the fields, accounted for the onlyproduction.   ``If your sister goes to school,'' Dumont told one young Africanclerk, ``you'll have nothing to eat but your fountain pen.''   It took economists 25 years to focus on these basic crises,despite three more Dumont books on the subject.   Dumont was so close to the mark that President Julius Nyerere ofTanzania and Kenneth Kuanda of Zambia took his ideas as their own,although neither put them into practice.   In Latin America, Dumont warned of disappearing rain forests,rising debt and the economic dominance of coca crops well beforeenvironmentalists sounded the alarm.   In Asia, he presaged the Green Revolution.   Today, he remains one step ahead. The World Resources Institutein Washington suggested that natural resources be included inmeasuring a nation's economic worth. Vintage Dumont.   A growing number of economists and environmentalists argue thatgasoline should be heavily taxed to discourage waste and generateresearch funds. Dumont pressed for that well before the oil crisis.   As agronomists finally consider the specter of mass hunger, theyreach for a book Dumont wrote in 1966: ``We Are Headed For Famine.''   In the 1970s, he edged into politics. He ran for president in1974 and won 1.3 percent of the vote. He holds non-specific leftistviews that put the Earth first. His latest book, ``An IntolerableWorld,'' picks apart free-market dogma.   His forthright striding through French politics has caused someto lose sight of his scientific expertise and his track record.   ``Some people say I weaken my credibility by being political,''he says. ``They don't understand. The environment is politics.''   Asked why his spirits had not flagged, reiterating the obvious tothe uninterested for so many years, Dumont shakes his head in sharpdisagreement and recounts the previous week's schedule.   ``If you reach anyone at all, you are making an impact,'' hesays. ``I need everyone to save the planet.''   When not lecturing or writing, Dumont is out learning something.   At the Spain panel, he skipped lunch and reappeared later,coddling a bouquet of wildflowers carefully uprooted for study.   His professor's salary, royalties and assorted earnings mightallow him to take it easy amid the nature he has defended all hislife.   ``I tried four months of retirement,'' he says. ``It was fourmonths of nervous depression.''   His apartment is spare but for walls of books and a few doodadssuch as a fifth century Chinese buffalo and some priceless Tanghorses.   When an interviewer comes to lunch, he sweeps hisworks-in-progress off the small antique table he uses as a desk; itdoubles as the dining table.   ``We don't believe in having a separate room only for eating,''Dumont says. ``Such a waste.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
