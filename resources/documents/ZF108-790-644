(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Lori MeadsandM;Once thought of as a training ground for programmers, BASIC has now found aniche of its own in business environments.andM;The efficiency, maintainability and affordability of advanced BASIC compilersand interpreters allows programmers to develop a variety of applications andutilities.andM;In addition, BASIC offers capabilities for small and mid-sized companies tocustomize commercial software.andM;BASIC was developed in 1964 at Dartmouth College by John Kemeny and ThomasKurtz.andP;  The language was originally designed to introduce beginners toprogramming, but it has continued to evolve in order to meet the demands ofthe marketplace.andM;With BASIC, programmers can have the best of both worlds: ease of use andmaintenance of programs, and capabilities for using graphics, music andsound.andM;Growing with BASICandM;&quot;BASIC is simple enough for a beginner to write a usable program in an hour,&quot;said Robert Zale, developer of PowerBasic from Spectra Publishing inSunnyvale, Calif.andM;&quot;A user can continue to grow with it.andP;  It's not lacking any of the seriousfeatures of any other languages in the marketplace,&quot; he said.andM;Many vendors agreed that the success of BASIC in the business environment isdue to its adaptability, and that buyers can choose the &quot;flavor&quot; that bestsuits their business needs.andM;According to Mike Hedge, president of Hedge Systems in Glendale, Calif.,andO;while every language has a certain niche, BASIC has a broader base than most.andM;&quot;The variety of features have been changing people's opinions.andP;  The BASICproduct war now proves how popular BASIC actually is,&quot; Hedge pointed out.andM;Terry Bradunas, Concept Omega Corp.'s director of marketing services forThoroughbred Basic in Somerset, N.J., said that the numbers alone indicateBASIC is booming.andM;&quot;A year ago, IDC [International Data Corp., a market-research firm] indicatedthat business BASIC had an installed base of 80,000, surpassed only by theIBM mainframe 300 to 3,000 series and by DEC's VAX/VMS units,&quot; he said.andM;But how can BASIC continue to compete in an ever-changing market withever-increasing demands from programmers?andM;According to Thom Olson, president of Basis International, in Albuquerque,N.M., the key to competitive continuity for BASIC is universal portability.andM;&quot;If a developer can write turnkey business systems that can run on 100different computers, the portability factor is high,&quot; he said.andM;John Lutz, president of True Basic Inc. in West Lebanon, N.H., believes theway to remain competitive is to offer a modern interface.andM;&quot;Providing programmers with development tools -- such as menus, dialogueboxes and mouse control -- can now be achieved within BASIC itself, withoutadd-on applications,&quot; he said.andM;While BASIC is still perceived to be slower than other languages such as C,Lutz thinks this will eventually change.andP;  &quot;In the future, with thereduced-instruction chips and faster processing times,&quot; he said, &quot;the extratime required to run a program will be minimal.&quot;andM;Basis International's Olson agrees that speed is not an issue.andP;  &quot;With BASIC,the developer is now in the position to enhance applications visually,&quot; hesaid.andM;&quot;The perception that BASIC is slow is unwarranted.andP;  In a typical businessapplication -- vertical or horizontal -- 80 to 90 percent of the processingis disk I/O.andP;  The language has nothing to do with performance,&quot; Olson added.andM;Zale maintains that the only way for BASIC to compete with other languages inthe long term is in ease of use.andM;&quot;We're all market-driven,&quot; Zale said.andP;  &quot;I think the marketplace would like tosee programming become even more simple.andP;  We're not going to take BASIC andturn it into C.&quot;andM;The Future of BASICandM;True Basic's Lutz believes that BASIC's appeal will continue to be thecustomization of commercial software.andM;&quot;People are happy with their word-processing package, they're happy withtheir database, but they would like automation between the two.andP;  That's whereBASIC comes in,&quot; he said.andM;BASIC is increasingly perceived by many to be on the same level as C orPascal, and Joe Byrd, general manager for Spectra Publishing, believes itspower is growing -- particularly in smaller companies.andM;&quot;The next step for BASIC is object programming -- the idea where you don'thave subroutines.andP;  Programmers will see a more integrated package withon-line help menus,&quot; he predicted.andM;&quot;BASIC is suitable for the long haul,&quot; said Olson.andP;  &quot;It's much moreappropriate than other languages for manipulating data and programs in therealm of interconnectivity.andM;&quot;You'll see more compilers and fourth-generation languages begin to surfacein the marketplace,&quot; he added.andP;  &quot;And developers will see Unix as the nextenvironment for BASIC.&quot;andM;According to Tom Button, BASIC program manager for Microsoft Corp. inRedmond, Wash., the staying power of the language will depend upon users'awareness of the market.andM;&quot;The biggest challenge is educating the marketplace on the evolution ofBASIC,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It's important to be aggressive about getting the modernforms of BASIC into schools.andM;&quot;We expect BASIC to control applications as a macro language.andP;  It will becomethe primary tool for vertical applications.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
