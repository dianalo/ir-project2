GM, in a statement yesterday, confirmed that itsexecutives have met with South Korean government officials to&quot;discuss our relationship with Daewoo.&quot; A GM spokesman saidthe company had no further comment. But other companyofficials indicated the 13-year-old partnership could besevered unless disputes between GM and Daewoo over managementand funding of their 50-50 car-making venture are resolved.</LP><TEXT>   Daewoo had no comment yesterday on the reports, whichappeared over the weekend in the South Korean press. A Daewoorepresentative in Detroit said he hadn't received anyofficial statement from the parent company.   A break with Daewoo could complicate GM's effort to expandits presence in the growing Asian auto market, includingSouth Korea. GM and Daewoo have four separate joint-ventureoperations. The largest is the car plant in Inchon thatproduces the Pontiac LeMans for the U.S., as well as modelsfor South Korea and other Asian and Middle Eastern markets.GM also has three auto-parts ventures with Daewoo. Theventures grew out of an earlier relationship between GM andSaehan motors, begun in 1972.   The GM-Daewoo car-making venture, launched in 1982, hasbeen hobbled by quality problems, labor disputes and clashesbetween GM and Daewoo management.   Aggravating the management disputes is the fact that theLeMans, a low-priced subcompact based on GM Europe's OpelKadett, has sold poorly in the U.S. Early production modelswere riddled with defects, and while Pontiac officials saythe car's quality is much improved, its image isn't. Salesfor the year to date are off 15% from 1990, despite bigrebates.   Still, if GM doesn't patch up its problems with Daewoo,it's unlikely the No. 1 auto maker will abandonvehicle-making in South Korea. GM wouldn't comment on reportsin South Korea that it's considering a link-up with Ssangyonggroup, another South Korean vehicle maker. But one GMofficial pointed out that the LeMans, like any other productGM buys from a supplier, could be assembled by anothercompany.</TEXT></DOC>
