Overall, it was found that the distribution of exchange ratesalong the sequence is dominated by the interstrand hydrogen bonds ofthe {beta}-sheet structures. The slowly exchanging protons in the coreof the two {beta}-sheets were shown to exchange via an EX2 mechanism.Further analysis of the data indicates that different large-scale structurefluctuations are responsible for the exchange from the two {beta}-sheets,even though the three-dimensional structure of Tendamistat appears toconsist of a single structural domain.</TEXT></DOC>
