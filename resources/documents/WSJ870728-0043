The caller has discovered a way to keep the sun from burning out, he says, and needs Mr. Drucker's help to publicize the find lest the Earth be destroyed. Mr. Drucker politely phones back and declines the invitation.    Not all of Mr. Drucker's admirers think he can keep the sun from self-destructing. But very many of them, it seems, do think it rises and sets by him.    He is called &quot;the father of modern management&quot; for his pioneering studies at General Motors Corp. back in the 1940s. His books -- 22 of them, including &quot;Concept of the Corporation&quot; and &quot;Management: Tasks, Responsibilities and Practices&quot; -- have sold millions of copies and made his name almost a household word. He is credited with inventing &quot;management by objective,&quot; a widely used management method. He claims to have been the first to apply the military concept of strategy to business.    Students here at Claremont Graduate School sign up for Prof. Drucker's classes simply because he is teaching them, without much regard for the subject matter. (Next October the graduate school's management center will be named after him.) Managers fly here from all over the world to attend seminars on such topics as &quot;How Competent Are You as an Executive?&quot; and &quot;Change and Innovation.&quot;    Others line up to pay him fees double or triple those charged by ordinary consultants, and count themselves lucky to be allowed to do so. &quot;I spent a fair amount of time convincing him&quot; that he should consult with Colonial Group Inc., says John A. McNeice, Jr., the chairman of the Boston-based financial-services group. &quot;It was a struggle.&quot;    Executives describe the 77-year-old Mr. Drucker, who frequently contributes articles to the editorial page of this newspaper, in tones of reverence. &quot;He's a man of infinite wisdom,&quot; says David Jones, the chairman of Humana Inc., which Mr. Drucker helped adapt to deregulation. Theodore Levitt, the editor of the Harvard Business Review, calls him &quot;the preeminent management thinker of our time.&quot; Mr. McNeice adds: &quot;He's the most brilliant man I have ever met.&quot;    In an age of management gurus, Peter Drucker is clearly No. 1. In some ways he seems ill-fitted for the role.    Over the decades, his clients have included a number of blue-chip companies. Clients say he charges about $5,000 a day. But he spends half his time consulting without charge, for groups such as the Girl Scouts, the Navajo Indians, several orders of nuns, and a group that includes TV evangelists. He has many admirers but few, if any, true disciples. Though he is known for many concepts, he doesn't have a clear and identifiable message, body of research or theory to his name.    Rather, his admirers say they value his approach to problems -- at once scholarly and freewheeling -- that is peculiar to him, difficult to emulate and, at times, difficult to describe. &quot;He sees the world differently from you and me, and that's extraordinarily valuable,&quot; says Walter Wriston, former chairman of Citicorp, who frequently invited Mr. Drucker to talk to senior managment there.    Still, some academics find his analysis insufficiently rigorous, and some consultants find it impractical. &quot;He makes you feel warm all over, but how do you translate that into action?&quot; asks Jim Farley, senior chairman at the consulting firm of Booz Allen andamp; Hamilton Inc.    But critics are few and far between. By his considerable fame and influence alone, in fact, some consider it professional suicide to admit to disagreeing with him -- or not understanding him. &quot;I refer to him as His Eminence,&quot; says Thomas Peters, who, as co-author with Robert H. Waterman Jr. of &quot;In Search of Excellence,&quot; is himself a fixture on the consulting and lecture circuit. &quot;I would never criticize Drucker in a setting with corporate managers,&quot; Mr. Peters adds. &quot;It would be pretty dumb to tick off 90% of your audience in one sitting. A lot of people think he speaks nothing but the truth.&quot;    Peter Ferdinand Drucker doesn't fit the buttoned-down, mallard-suspendered mold of many management consultants. His voice is still thick with the accent of his native Austria. He favors bright colors: a bottle-green shirt; a gold jacket and tie; a royal blue jacket, blue-on-blue shirt and a navy tie and slacks.    He has no secretary. He works from a home office full of books, such as a biography of Metternich and a history of Ford Motor Co. Copies of his own books, such as &quot;Adventures of a Bystander,&quot; his autobiography, and &quot;The Last of All Possible Worlds,&quot; one of his forays into fiction, are stacked in a garage along with a Hoover vacuum cleaner, a tricycle and overflowing chests of drawers.    His four children are grown, and for the past 16 years he has lived here, in a modest California-style ranch house. He moved to California because his wife, Doris, a technical patent consultant, tired of the climate of New York, where he taught for many years at New York University.    An admitted telephone addict, he answers all his calls himself, leaping to the phone at every ring. &quot;I love to pick up my phone,&quot; he says. &quot;I am undisciplined. I can't resist the ringing of the phone.&quot;    With hearing aids in both ears, he hears well, he says, but he frequently interjects What? into conversations, belying the assertion. At times, he fumbles through a plastic bag for fresh hearing-aid batteries or eye drops, which he applies without interrupting his monologues. When he droops from low blood sugar, he chews chocolate bars.    Yet during a seminar in which he single-handedly holds 100 people spellbound during five hours on the podium, his energy never flags. As in most of his talks, he wanders among his current pet themes. On the declining importance of blue-collar work, for instance, he says: &quot;If you're working on improving labor productivity, you're wasting your time. Very few companies have more than 10% labor costs.&quot; Rather, he suggests improving the productivity of capital. On the role of management education: &quot;The first and most important component of management is training.&quot; On the importance of cash flow, not earnings per share, in making management decisions: &quot;You have to know where the money is.&quot;    Japan and the Japanese are passions. He is an avid collector of Japanese art. His books are best sellers in Japan. He considers himself an expert on Japan's economy and management style, and he enjoys startling other Japanophiles. &quot;Japan faces years of the most severe social unrest it has ever known,&quot; he asserts. &quot;The pillar of their success -- lifetime employment -- is becoming an almost insurmountable barrier to flexibility.&quot;    His monologues are sprinkled with levity. The only way to get rid of incompetent management at the very top, he tells an audience, &quot;is a heart attack.&quot; He adds, &quot;But it usually strikes the wrong person. It's not reliable.&quot;    On another occasion he details his cure for know-it-all managers: &quot;A sharp kick below the belt. In front or in back.&quot; To his group of advanced management students at Claremont he offers the following insight: &quot;There are very few bad situations that can't be solved by firing a passel of vice presidents.&quot;    He calls a San Diego seminar to order by whistling through his cupped hands and follows up with a one-liner. He acknowledges later that &quot;there is a sheer element of showmanship&quot; in his presentation. &quot;If you don't have an element of exhibitionism, you don't do it,&quot; he adds.    His command of information is legendary. One discussion with some European managers begins simply enough but quickly veers off. In the space of 20 minutes, Mr. Drucker has touched on composer Karl Czerny's elementary piano studies and European education, Bismarck and the German social-security system, the role of the devil and money in Goethe's &quot;Faust,&quot; Adam Smith's views on climate, and Machiavelli on wealth.    To some, such diversions are soporific. &quot;Sometimes it can get boring,&quot; says Lisa Lundquist, a graduate student at Claremont, who admits she sometimes doodles during his three-hour classes.    Others find his digressions to be the crux of his wisdom. &quot;Whatever he has to say -- about a Viennese brewery or World War I or politics -- I really listen to. I find every bit relevant,&quot; says Roxane Spitzer, a vice president of Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who took a course with Mr. Drucker.    But for all his erudition, Mr. Drucker can be sloppy. Some of his breezy anecdotes turn out, on checking, to be flawed. During one lecture, for example, he says that English is the official language for all employees at Mitsui andamp; Co., the Japanese trading company, even in Tokyo. But a Mitsui spokeswoman says that Japanese is still the &quot;lingua franca&quot; in Mitsui offices.    On another occasion, Mr. Drucker tells an advanced management seminar that 40% of the copies of Mr. Peters's &quot;In Search of Excellence&quot; are given as high-school graduation presents. But no such tallies are kept, according to spokesmen for Mr. Peters and for Harper andamp; Row, which publishes both Mr. Peters and Mr. Drucker. Another time, Mr. Drucker tells a group of Europeans that the Matsushita plant with the highest productivity is in Hamburg, followed by plants in Dallas and Tijuana. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., however, says it doesn't have a plant in Dallas. Nor, the spokesman says, does it rank its plants' world-wide productivity.    Asked about these and other inconsistencies, Mr. Drucker says, &quot;I use anecdotes to make a point, not to write history.&quot;    Mr. Drucker got his start back in 1943 when he undertook a lengthy study of General Motors. The study, later published as &quot;Concept of the Corporation,&quot; distressed GM because of its implied criticisms, but it launched Mr. Drucker. The book was the first detailed study of the inner workings of a corporation. From Mr. Drucker's work grew the notion, now mundane but then revolutionary, that managing was a job separate and distinct from other jobs in a company.    In the 1950s, working with Harold Smiddy, a vice president at General Electric Co., Mr. Drucker formulated so-called management by objective, a method of redesigning an organization to allow managers to set their own goals. He also argues that innovation can be fostered within an organization and recommends continual &quot;organized abandonment&quot; of outworn products and activities.    &quot;He really was instrumental in creating or making legitimate a lot of things that are part and parcel of standard management practice today,&quot; says Alan Kantrow, the editor of a quarterly published by consultants McKinsey andamp; Co.    These days, some people bring him specific problems. Mr. Jones of Humana has seen him every year for 10 years to discuss corporate strategy. Others visit him for other reasons. &quot;I've taken groups {to see him} whenever I've embarked on a project I want an iconoclastic view on,&quot; says Nancy Badore, the program director of Ford Motor Co.'s executive-development center. A few seek advice of a more personal nature. Mr. Drucker is helping Robert Buford, of Buford Television Inc. in Tyler, Texas, draw up a &quot;personal life plan&quot; that includes developing a foundation to help big religious organizations.    Counted among Peter Drucker's biggest fans is Peter Drucker. &quot;I have a gift of perception,&quot; he says. &quot;It's an invaluable gift. You have to be careful not to abuse it.&quot; Asked about his role in &quot;popularizing&quot; concepts like management by objective and strategic planning, he remonstrates. &quot;I didn't popularize them,&quot; he says. I invented them.&quot;    He says he enjoys consulting and lecturing because of the opportunity it affords him to learn. &quot;You have no idea how much I learn listening to myself,&quot; he tells those at the seminar in San Diego. &quot;All the things I say I've never thought about!&quot;    Nonetheless, many people single out modesty and courtesy as among Mr. Drucker's most sterling traits. Indeed, some say it is his homespun quality that makes him so appealing. &quot;He's a man with a hilarious sense of humor,&quot; says Ms. Badore of Ford. When Cass Canfield Jr., Mr. Drucker's editor at Harper andamp; Row, recently called the consultant on a business matter, he says, Mr. Drucker &quot;asked after my children and where I am going to go on vacation. He's a tremendously kind and thoughtful person.&quot; And, Mr. Canfield adds, &quot;he brings my assistant flowers.&quot;    &quot;He's a unique fellow,&quot; says Mr. Wriston. &quot;I don't think there is anyone else like him.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
