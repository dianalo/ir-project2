In a Wall Street Journal survey of 209 early reporting companies, second-quarter operating profits surged 40%, to 2.77 billion Canadian dollars ($2.08 billion), while six-month earnings rose 44%, to 5.08 billion dollars. Profits in the first quarter had risen more than 50% from a year earlier.    The reason for the robust profit performance can be summed up in two words: natural resources. Michael Manford, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., said, &quot;Canada's much maligned resource sector is pulling its traditional late-cycle turnaround,&quot; giving a profit kick to the sectors that are the foundation of the Canadian economy.    The outlook remains positive, Mr. Manford said. The Canadian economy grew by 3.1% last year, despite low prices for oil and metals. With higher resources prices and renewed capital spending in the oil patch and forest industry, &quot;the Canadian economy should easily grow by 3.5% this year and, depending on the timing of the resource spending, could surpass that by a significant margin,&quot; he said.    Most resources companies were forced to cut costs drastically when prices were low, so recent price increases have a much greater effect on the bottom line. In addition, with various changes to energy policy in Canada, Mr. Manford said, &quot;the netback to (Canadian) oil producers is now equal to, or slightly above, the levels that they received&quot; when oil was above 30 dollars a barrel. Net-back is the price received for a barrel of oil after government royalties.    For 15 companies in the energy sector, second-quarter earnings jumped 124%, to 431.2 million dollars, while first-half profits rose 76%, to 882.1 million dollars. The best quarterly gains were 256%, by Shell Canada Ltd., 79%-owned by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and 97%, by Imperial Oil Ltd., 70%-owned by Exxon Corp.    In the mining industry, profits for 25 companies jumped 290%, to 231.9 million dollars, in the quarter and 301%, to 302.8 million dollars, in the first half. Noranda Inc. saw its quarterly profit quadruple to 103.1 million dollars.    Profit gains are nothing new for the forest-products group, with the second quarter marking the seventh consecutive period for higher year-to-year profits. For 17 companies in the group, second-quarter earnings rose 61%, to 355.6 million dollars, and six-month earnings jumped 95%, to 657 million dollars.    Continuing strong demand for both wood and paper products have allowed companies to raise prices. Also, a decline in the value of the Canadian dollar against European currencies has given the Canadian industry a cost advantage over Scandinavian competitors, especially for exports to the crucial U.S. market.    Paper-industry trade groups are reporting advances in production this year, and many plants are operating at almost full capacity. As a result, several major companies have recently announced plans for new newsprint plants or expansions of existing facilities.    In the 55-company industrial-products sector, second-quarter profits rose 12%, to 511.8 million dollars, while six-month earnings were up 24%, to 869.7 million dollars. There was no clear trend in this group, with most companies reporting modest profit increases or declines. Among the more notable group members, Northern Telecom Ltd.'s quarterly profit was up 20%, Dofasco Inc.'s net rose 40%, and Alcan Aluminium Ltd.'s earnings fell 10%.    Earnings were generally higher in the consumer-products and financial-services sectors. Profits were flat to slightly higher for retailers, utilities, publishing companies and consumer-products concerns. </TEXT></DOC>
