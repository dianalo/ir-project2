The plea bargain announced Wednesday by U.S. Attorney Rudolph W.Giuliani is the most stunning break in a criminal probe of thenation's fifth-largest investment firm, which bankrolled some of thebiggest corporate takeovers of the decade through its pioneering useof high-yield ``junk bond'' securities.   The probe already has cost Drexel nearly $2 billion in lostbusiness and legal expenses, sapped morale of its 10,000 employeesand seriously undermined what many consider Wall Street's mostaggressive and able financier.   Sources familiar with Drexel's decision, who spoke on conditionthey not be identified, said its board of directors agonizedWednesday afternoon before approving the settlement, which wouldbrand Drexel as a felon but spare it a potentially ruinous,drawn-out trial.   Other sources said the agreement also increased the chances thatformer Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, whose Tennessee lawpartnership has been hired by Drexel as a corporate governanceconsultant, would join the firm, most likely as chairman. Baker wasin New York on Tuesday and met with Drexel officials duringdeliberations on the case.   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Baker, aformer White House chief of staff, was not interested in assuming amajor role at the firm if it meant presiding over a lengthy trial.   The settlement would mark a complete turnaround in Drexel'sclaims of innocence. It also does not protect Michael Milken,Drexel's senior high-yield bond executive and another key target ofthe criminal probe. Milken has asserted he's done nothing wrong.   The deal with Giuliani still requires approval by the Securitiesand Exchange Commission and senior Justice Department officials.   By admitting guilt in the settlement, Drexel exposes itself tonumerous lawsuits by investors who claim they were victimized by thefirm's admittedly illegal acts.   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to comment on how theboard voted or its specific reasons, but said directors had``concluded that this settlement is in the best interest of our firmand our employees.''   Milken's public relations agent, the New York firm Robinson,Lake, Lerer andamp; Montgomery, said in a statement: ``There is no changein his position, and his attorneys are continuing to prepare todefend him against any charges that might be brought.''   SEC enforcement director Gary Lynch did not return telephonecalls for comment about the agreement between Drexel and Giuliani.   The agreement is the high-water mark in a federal crackdown onsecurities fraud that resulted in the arrest two years ago of IvanBoesky, the now-imprisoned inside trader who turned state's evidenceand was a key source of information in the case against Drexel.   The $650 million fine _ more than four times as large as theSEC's annual budget _ is by far the biggest penalty ever assessedfor securities fraud. It easily surpasses the previous record of$100 million levied against Boesky in November 1986.   The settlement also marks a major victory for Giuliani, who hadbeen pressuring the firm for weeks to settle the case or face a muchbroader and potentially crippling racketeering and fraud indictment.   ``There are contingencies,'' Giuliani told reporters at a hastilycalled news conference. ``Everybody is proceeding in good faith, Ihope.''   Giuliani said the felonies cover mail, wire and securities fraudviolations but would not be more specific. He also declined toelaborate on the components of the $650 million fine, except to sayit would cover criminal fines, civil penalties and future damageclaims against the investment firm.   Asked why he chose to press for a settlement instead of proceedwith an indictment, Giuliani said ``when a corporation is involved,the best result you can get after any trial is a financial result... There's no point of prolonging this, getting involved incriminal litigation to get a result that would not be any betterthan this.''   Several key Drexel executives themselves had been pushing for asettlement, saying the continuing barrage of publicity and negativespeculation was eroding the firm's ability to maintain its business.   Anreder alluded to the internal pressure for a settlement in hisstatement, saying: ``For the past two years, our employees haveendured extraordinary hardship and this unprecedented and complexcase might have taken several more years to resolve.''   He also said: ``After the settlement, we will continue to haveone of the strongest financial positions of any firm in ourindustry. The settlement will allow us to concentrate all ourenergies, once again, on serving our clients and building ourbusiness.''   The U.S. attorney's probe of Drexel closely resembled theinvestigation by the SEC, which filed a wide-ranging civil suitagainst Drexel, Milken and three other key employees three monthsago. The suit, which has been stalled in federal court, accuses themof conspiring with Boesky to commit a litany of frauds ranging frominsider trading to phony record-keeping.</TEXT></DOC>
