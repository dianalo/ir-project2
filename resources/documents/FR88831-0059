The Final EnvironmentalImpact Statement, Remedial Actions at the Former Climax Uranium CompanyUranium Mill Site, Grand Junction, Mesa County, Colorado, (DOE-EIS 126-F),was issued in December, 1986. Since that time, new information has beencollected on tailings transport by slurry pipeline, the potential economicimpacts of the proposed action, and the ability of the proposed actionto comply with proposed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) groundwaterprotection standards. In addition, the location of the disposal cell andvolumes of contaminated, borrow, and restoration materials have changed.As a result of the new information and potentially significant changesto the proposed action, an analysis was prepared to determine whether tosupplement the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The analysis indicatedthat the proposed changes were not relevant to environmental concerns andthat the new information would have little bearing on the proposed actionor its impacts.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On November 8, 1978, the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA),Pub. L. 95-604, as amended, was enacted in order to address a Congressionalfinding that uranium mill tailings located at inactive processing sitesmay pose a potantial health hazard to the public. On November 8, 1979,the DOE designated 24 inactive processing sites for remedial action underTitle I of the UMTRCA, including the former Climax Uranium Company UraniumMill site (hereinafter the Grand Junction Site) in Grand Junction, Colorado(44 FR 74892).Pursuant to the UMTRCA, the DOE and the state of Colorado entered intoa cooperative agreement effective October 19, 1981, for remedial actionat the Grand Junction site and at eight other inactive uranium mill sitesin Colorado. Under this cooperative agreement, the state and the NuclearRegulatory Commission (NRC) must concur with the remedial action plan developedby the DOE for relocation to the Cheney Reservoir site, and the DOE andthe state will cost-share the remedial action. Under the cost-sharing provisions,the DOE will pay 90 percent and the state 10 percent of the tailings and/orsite acquisition, engineering, and construction costs.Also, the UMTRCA requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)to promulgate remedial action standards for inactive uranium mill sites.The purpose of these standards is to protect the public health and safetyand the environment from radiological and nonradiological hazards associatedwith residual radioactive materials at the sites. The final standards (40CFR Part 192) were promulgated with an effective date of March 7, 1983.However, on September 3, 1985, the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appealsset aside parts of the final EPA standards concerning groundwater protection,40 CFR Part 192.20(a) (2) and (3) (see American Mining Congress V. Thomas772 F. 2d 617, Tenth Circuit Court, 1985). The groundwater protection standardswere remanded to the EPA for further consideration in light of the Court'sopinion that the groundwater standards promulgated by the EPA on March7, 1983, were site-specific rather than of general application as requiredby the UMTRCA. The EPA issued proposed groundwater protection standardsfor comment on September 24, 1987.Section 108(a)(3) of the UMTRCA provides that if the EPA has not promulgatedfinal standards by October 31, 1982, remedial actions taken by the DOEshall comply with the proposed standards until such time as the standardsare promulgated in final form. This section also applies to the proposedgroundwater protection standards. The DOE intends to comply with the provisionsof Subparts A and C of the proposed groundwater protection standard (40CFR 192.21) immediately. When the EPA groundwater protection standardsare finalized, the DOE will reevaluate its groundwater protection planand undertake such action as is necessary to ensure that the requirementsof Subpart B, which addresses aquifer restoration, are met. The need foraquifer restoration at the Grand Junction site will be evaluated afterthe tailings have been relocated and stabilized. The need for and extentof aquifer restoration will be evaluated in a separate NEPA document. <ITAG tagnum="84">Project Description </ITAG>The Grand Junction site is a 104-acre property adjacent to the south sideof the city of Grand Junction, Colorado, and adjacent to the north sideof the Colorado River. The Grand Junction site consists of the tailingsarea, mill site, and effluent ponds from the former mill site, which wasoperated by the Climax Uranium Company between 1951 and 1970. The Grand Junction site contains an estimated 4.06 million cubic yardsof uranium mill tailings in the form of finely-ground sand, slimes, andcontaminated soils. The tailings are covered with approximately 6 inchesof soil and sparse vegetation. Concrete and brick from the demolished millbuildings were placed as riprap along the north bank of the Colorado River.The State of Colorado presently uses a portion of the site, the State Repository,for temporary storage of contaminated materials obtained from remedialaction at vicinity properties in the Grand Junction area. Vicinity propertiesare homes, businesses, public buildings, and vacant lots that may havebeen contaminated during construction by the use of tailings as a buildingmaterial or as fill material before the hazards associated with this materialwere known. The use of the tailings for these purposes is no longer allowed.Remedial action is being performed at vicinity properties under the state-operatedGrand Junction Remedial Action Program (GJRAP) and the DOE-operated UraniumMill Tailings Remedial Action (UMTRA) Project. Approximately 4009 propertiesin Mesa County are estimated to have levels of radiation in excess of EPAstandards and will be formally included on the vicinity property list.It is estimated that 3937 properties will be remediated; 1482 propertieswere remediated as of February 28, 1988. Of the remaining 2455 properties,it is estimated that 72 will not be remediated due to refusals by ownersto participate in the project. Any additional vicinity properties identifiedprior to closure of the disposal cell will also be remediated. Survey workis scheduled to be completed by September of 1990. Vicinity property estimatesare subject to ongoing revision. The differences in the number of vicinityproperty estimates in the Grand Junction Environmental Impact Statement(EIS) and this Record of Decision are not significant. The Cheney Reservoir site, the selected disposal site, is approximately18 miles southeast of the Grand Junction site and 5 miles southeast ofthe community of Whitewater. The Cheney Reservoir site lies between GrandMesa and the Gunnison River and is approximately 2 miles east of U.S. Highway50. The Cheney Reservoir site is named for the closet geographic featureof distinction, Cheney Reservoir, 1.5 miles southeast of the disposal site.The Cheney Reservoir site is used primarily for low-density grazing althoughthere is an existing oil and gas lease on the site. The terrain is veryflat and the area is sparsely covered with grasses and shrubs. The areanorth of the site, along Kannah Creek, is intensely farmed. Privately ownedland lies to the north, west, and south of the site. The Chene Reservoir site, which is on land administered by the Bureau ofLand Management (BLM), will be permanently withdrawn from public use. TheBLM published a notice of proposed withdrawal (49 FR 30801) for the CheneyReservoir site in 1984, which proposed to withdraw an area of about 360acres in Township 3 South, Range 2 East, sections 11, 12, 13, and 14 (Figure1). Although the stabilized tailings pile will only cover about 80 acres,adjacent lands are required for stockpiling of materials, equipment, waterretention basins, and other construction-related activities. During thedevelopment of the conceptual design, the area immediately adjacent (south)to the proposed withdrawal area was selected as the ultimate disposal area.The DOE has subsequently amended the withdrawal application to decreasethe area required in sections 11 and 12 and to increase the area requiredin sections 13 and 14; the total amended withdrawal area will encompassabout 340 acres (Figure 1). Although the amended area of withdrawal represents a modification fromthe area discussed in the EIS, the analyses in the EIS are applicable tothe amended area for several reasons: andbullet; The site characterization activities (e.g., test pits, monitoringwells, radiological surveys, seismic analysis, and flora and fauna surveys)for many environmental components were representative of the general arearather than restricted to the limits of the original withdrawal area. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 3 1637 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-C </ITAG>andbullet; Impacts analyses for most environmental components are primarilyaffected by volumes of materials handled rather than by minor locationmodifications. These components include radiation; air quality; noise;population and work force; housing, social structure, and community services;economic structures; transportation networks; energy, water, and fuel use;and accident probabilities.andbullet; For the environmental components typically affected by locationmodifications (flora and fauna, soils and mineral resources, hydrology,land use, and scenic and cultural resources), the impacts analyses arerepresentative of the area rather than of a limited, site-specific naturebecause of the broad characterization of the activities.andbullet; As stated in the EIS, the impacts analyses are based on conservativeassumptions and represent a reasonable uppler limit on the severity ofthe impacts that may occur. For these reasons, the description of the affected environment and theimpacts analyses of the EIS are representative of the amended area of withdrawal. The purpose of the remedial action is to stabilize and control the residualwastes from the Grand Junction site at the Cheney Reservoir site in a mannerthat complies with the EPA standards (40 CFR Part 192). The principal featureof the selected alternative is the relocation of the tailings and othercontaminated materials by truck or truck/rail combination (Alternatives3 and 4 in the EIS, respectively) for isolation and stablization in theapproximately 80-acre Cheney Reservoir disposal cell. The Cheney Reservoir disposal site will be permanently withdrawn frompublic use. Access to the Grand Junction site and the tailings will beprovided by the State of Colorado pursuant to section 104 of UMTRCA. Thecurrent owner will retain title to the mill site. The materials obtainedin the cleanup of vicinity properties will be delivered to the Grand Junctionsite and later transported to the Cheney Reservoir site for final stabilization. Remedial action is planned in two phases. Phase I will begin with sitepreparation and demolition at the Grand Junction Site. Phase II will followwith excavation, transportation, placement, and construction of the necessarysupport facilities. Phase I will be performed at the mill site and willinclude construction of: fencing, temporary roads, drainage ditches, andthe wastewater retention basin. Phase II construction consists of: excavatingthe tailings embankment and processing the cover material at Cheney; installationof the slurry wall at the Climax Site for dewatering, loading/hauling/placementof the tailings; and construction of miscellaneous construction facilities.The construction facilities include decontamination pads, fencing, thewater retention pond at Cheney Site, and so on to support the work. Theradon barrier and erosion protection cover will be placed over the tailings.Excavated disposal site material will be processed and used for cover.The maximum sideslopes of the embankment will be five horizontal to onevertical, and the top of the embankment will have a maximum slope of fourpercent. An unpaved road from U.S. Highway 50 will remain as permanentaccess. The disturbed area at the Grand Junction site will be backfilled withclean soil, contoured for surface drainage, and seeded. The Grand Junctionsite will be available for uses as permitted by applicable local land useordinances, following completion of the remedial action. Additional detailsare available in Sections 3.2.4 and 3.2.5 of the Final EIS. Subsequent to the December, 1986, publication of the Final EIS, the DOE,at the request of Mesa County and the city of Grand Junction, conductedadditional studies of projected socioeconomic impacts and a slurry pipelinetransportation. An Environmental Analysis was prepared in May 1988 to examinethese studies and to determine whether or not the Final EIS should be supplemented.In addition, the Environmental Analysis contains a detailed evaluationof the ability of the proposed action to comply with the newly proposedgroundwater protection standards. <ITAG tagnum="84">Description of Alternatives </ITAG>The following alternatives to the selected action (Alternative 3 or 4)were considered in detail) in the EIS by the DOE in reaching its decisionto relocate the wastes and to stabilize them at the Cheney Reservoir site.All of the alternatives, except no action, include remedial action at anestimated 3937 vicinity properties in Mesa County. <T3>Alternative 1_No Action: </T3>This alternative consists of performingno remedial action. Radon emanation and gamma radiation from the GrandJunction site will continue to exceed EPA standards on or near the site.Without remedial action, the DOE cannot ensure that the tailings wouldnot be dispersed by wind, water, or humans, and cause considerably higherhealth effects than those that may presently exist. Therefore, the no actionalternative is unacceptable since the UMTRCA requires that the DOE ensurethe site is in compliance with EPA standards. <T3>Alternative 2_Stabilization at the Grand Junction Site: </T3>Underthis alternative, the tailings and other contaminated materials would bestabilized at their present location adjacent to the city of Grand Junction.The tailings and contaminated alluvium beneath the tailings would be excavatedand stockpiled. A subbase consisting of a fill layer, a capillary breaklayer, and a low-permeability layer would be constructed. The tailingsand other contaminated materials would be place on the subbase. The tailingsand contaminated materials would be covered with an earth radon barrierand an erosion protection layer of small rock. All sides of the pile wouldbe covered with rock armoring (large boulders) to protect against the erosionalforces of flooding in the Colorado River. All areas not occupied by thestabilized tailings would be recontoured and revegetated. <T3>Alternative 5_Disposal at the Two Road Site with Truck Transport: </T3>Underthis alternative, the tailings and of the contaminated material would berelocated to the Two Road site 33 miles northwest of the Grand Junctionsite. A pit, averaging nine feet in depth, would be excavated at the TwoRoad site and a low-permeability layer would be constructed in the bottomof the pit. The tailings and other contaminated materials would be relocatedby truck to the Two Road site, placed on the low-permeability layer, andbe covered with an earth radon barrier and an erosion protection layerof small rock. After removal of the tailings and other contaminated materials,the Grand Junction site would be recontoured and revegetated. <T3>Alternative 6_Disposal at the Two Road Site with Train and Truck Transport:</T3>This alternative is the same as Alternative 5 except that the tailingsand contaminated material would be transported partially by train and partiallyby truck. The tailings and contaminated materials would be loaded ontoa train at the Grand Junction site and transported to Mack, where the tailingswould be loaded onto trucks and transported west on U.S. Highway 6 andamp;50 to Two Road and north to the Two Road site approximatley 3.4 miles.One trainload of tailings and contaminated materials would be transportedeach day. All other aspects of the alternative are identical to Alternative5. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments Received </ITAG>Comments on the Final EIS were received from 95 individuals, various localbusinesses, the Mesa County Health Department, the Mesa County Commissioners,Mesa County Planning Commission, local agencies, elected officials, thestate of Colorado, and the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI). Commentsfrom the majority of the commentors focused on the selection of the disposalsite (preference for Two Road), the mode of transportation (preferencefor truck/rail), the route for truck transportation, costs, and requestsfor an extension to allow for additional input prior to the issuance ofthis Record of Decision. These issues are responded to in summary formbelow. All comments will be addressed specifically during the final designprocess, through consultation with the state of Colorado and the DOI. andbullet; Preference for the Two Road site_As discussed in greater detailbelow, the Cheney Reservoir site is selected for disposal of the tailingsand other wastes due to environmental considerations. The Cheney Reservoirsite would cause fewer impacts to threatened and endangered species andwould result in fewer transportation-related accidents. andbullet; Preference for truck/train transport_Although the analyses inthe EIS indicate that truck/train transport is considerably more expensivethan truck transport, the DOE acknowledges that these cost estimates mayvary substantially when construction contractors have an opportunity tosubmit price quotations. In addition, the potential for accidents is slightlyless for the truck/train option than for the truck option. andbullet; The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, in its 1988 report,calls on the DOE to ``take into consideration the impacts of the methodof transportation selected, including, but not limited to, the negativeeconomic impact on the community, the adverse transportation impacts causedby haul route traffic on arterial roads and highways including trafficsafety; and the projected damage to streets and highways along the haulroute'' in considering the altenatives for disposal of the uranium milltailings at Grand Junction, Colorado. The DOE, with the input of communityrepresentatives, has conducted such a socioeconomic impact/benefit study.The DOE's Remedial Action Contractor (RAC) will specify the measures thatmust be taken by the contractor conducting the remedial action to mitigateadverse impacts related to the transportation options. andbullet; Truck transportation route_Since publication of the Final EISand in support of a design option, the DOE has evaluated in detail otherproposed inner city transportation route options. These options have inturn been addressed with the state of Colorado Department of Highways,the local task force, city and country agencies, the local DevelopmentAuthority, the Chamber of Commerce, and a majority of potentially affectedcitizens. In the event that the contractor selected by the RAC uses trucktransportation, trucks will exit from the northwest corner of the siteonto 9th Street, turn west (left) onto 4th Avenue, and then travel southboundonto U.S Highway 50 to the Cheney Reservoir site (Figure 2). This routewas selected to minimize use of local streets, provide safe ingress andegress from the roads, and to avoid residential areas. The actions necessaryto mitigate adverse traffic impacts are discussed below under CONSIDERATIONSIN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISION. andbullet; Truck/Train Transportation Route_Since publication of the FinalEIS, the DOE has established a truck/train transportation route. Trainswill leave the processing site in Grand Junction to an unloading facilitysouth of Whitewater using existing rail lines (Figure 3). Trucks will transportthe tailings from the unloading facility to Cheney Reservoir via U.S Highway50. Actions necessary to mitigate adverse traffic impacts of the truck/trainoption are discussed below under CONSIDERATIONS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OFTHE DECISION.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M002 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 3 1646-1647 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-C</ITAG>andbullet; Cost estimates_Since completion of the Final EIS, additional costestimates for various truck and truck/train transport options have beenprepared by the DOE and presented to the public. These estimates indicatethat the truck/train option remains substantially more costly (as muchas $12 million) than truck only transportation. In addition, the DOE, atthe request of the city of Grand Junction, has evaluated the transportationof tailings by slurry pipeline. The slurry pipeline alternative was foundto be approximately $42 million more costly than truck transportation toCheney Reservoir alternative and was subsequently rejected. In additionto its high cost, the slurry pipeline option has a number of adverse environmentalconsequences associated with it. The construction of a pipeline from theGrand Junction mill site to Cheney Reservoir would entail disturbance alongthe pipeline right-of-way. Slurried tailings would be wet and require dewateringat the disposal site, creating a new source of contaminated water. Pipelinefailure could result in spillage of wet tailings in otherwise uncontaminatedareas. Thus the slurry pipeline proposal has a greater adverse environmentalimpact than using existing roads or rail lines. andbullet; Schedule Extension_The DOE has deferred issuance of this Recordof Decision in order to re-examine socioeconomic impacts and to evaluatea slurry pipeline transportation alternative, which was not examined inthe Final EIS. An Environmental Analysis was prepared to examine the significanceof these issues, and to determine if a supplement to the Final EIS waswarranted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Basis for Decision</ITAG>Pursuant to the requirements of the UMTRCA, the EPA has promulgated healthand environmental standards to govern cleanup, stabilization, and controlof residual radioactive materials at inactive uranium mill tailings sites.The standards establish requirements for long term stability, limit radiationemanation, and protect groundwater quality. The EPA also determined thatsignificant public health risks associated with inactive tailings wereposed by prolonged exposure (to radon daughter products) to people livingand working in structures contaminated by relocated mill tailings. As aresult of these conclusions, prevention of misuse and dispersion of tailingsis an important objective of the EPA standards. Accordingly, long-termstability was emphasized in the development and promulgation of the standards.This is consistent with the guidance provided by the legislative historyof the UMTRCA, which stresses the importance of avoiding remedial actionthat would be effective for only a short period of time and that wouldrequire future Congressional consideration. The EPA standard-setting process distinguished ``passive controls'' (e.g.,thick earthen and rock covers) from ``active controls'' (e.g., semipermanentcovers, fences, signs and restrictions on land use) that would requirefrequent replacement or other major repairs requiring the expenditure ofpublic funds. The standard is framed as a longevity requirement that recognizesthe difficulty in predicting very long-term performance with a high degreeof confidence. Therefore, the EPA established a design objective of 1000years with a minimum period of 200 years, a time span that is more consistentwith engineering experience. In establishing the standards, the EPA determinedthat the radon emission limitation could be achieved by well-designed thickearthen covers. The standards recognize the need of institutional controls, such as custodialmaintenance, surveillance, and emergency response measures. In its preambleto the rules, the EPA calls for such controls to be provided as an essentialback-up to the primary, passsive controls. On September 3, 1985, the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals set asidethe EPA standard applicable to the protection of waterways and goundwater,40 CFR Part 192.20(a) (2) and (3) (see American Mining Congress v. Thomas,772 F. 2nd, Tenth Circuit Court). The goundwater protection standards wereremanded to the EPA for further consideration in light of the Court's opinionthat the groundwater protection standards promulgated by the EPA on March7, 1983, were site-specific rather than of general application as requiredby the UMTRCA. The EPA issued proposed groundwater protection standardsfor comment on September 24, 1987. Remedial action taken with regard tothe Grand Junction site will not preclude subsequent design enhancementsif needed to achieve compliance and will not limit the selection of reasonablegroundwater restoration methods that may be necessary when final standardsare promulgated. When the final EPA standards are promulgated, the DOEwill evaluate groundwater protection requirements and undertake such actionas is necessary to ensure that the final standards are met. The need forand extent of aquifer restoration will be evaluated in a separate NEPAprocess. The DOE has characterized the Cheney Reservoir site to determine whetherthe proposed conceptual design would be in compliance. The studies indicatethat the proposed conceptual design will not result in any substantiveenvironmental impacts in violation of the proposed standards. Under the proposed action, tailings will be placed at the Cheney Reservoirdisposal site in a partically below-grade cell. The disposal cell foundationwill consist of 10 to 20 feet of silty clay, zero to 10 feet of silty gravel,10 to 20 feet of weathered Mancos Shale, and Mancos Shale bedrock to adepth of about 780 feet below the surface. Drilling of a 1760-feet deepexploratory water well at the disposal site showed that there is no groundwaterbeneath the Cheney Reservoir disposal site to a depth of at least 1521feet. Shallow, perched goundwater is present beneath the proposed disposal site.The depth of the perched water table is about 15 feet beneath the proposedbase of the excavation. The shallow groundwater saturates a zone of approximately10 feet of weathered Mancos Shale. The quantity of water that can be withdrawnfrom a well completed in this shallow aquifer is estimated to be well belowthe 150 gallons per day or greater required for an aquifer to be considereda goundwater resource (40 CFR Part 192.21(g)), meaning the groundwateris class III and not suitable for domestic use. In addition to being extremely slow moving and of poor quality, the shallow,perched groundwater beneath the disposal site is spotty in occurrence,and a discreet surface discharge location for the water has not been locateddowngradient of the site. The small quantity of groundwater that is perchedbeneath the site probably discharges diffusely downgradient and into theunderlying Mancos Shale. To protect groundwater at the site, the disposal cell design and locationmake maximum use of favorable natural conditions. Some of these favorabledesign and disposal site features include the following:andbullet; Partially below-grade disposal of the tailings to limit the exposedarea of the pile. andbullet; A low hydraulic conductivity radon barrier to limit infiltrationthrough the tailings. andbullet; Abundant, naturally occuring, minerals in the foundation soilsthat will reduce or remove contaminants from the tailings leachate. An absence of groundwater resources for at least 1760 feet below and peripheralto the disposal site.Five constituents, arsenic (As), molybdenum (Mo), selenium (Se) uranium(U), and gross alpha activity, are expected to exceed the proposed EPAMaximum Concentration Limits (MCLs) at the edge of the disposal cell. Concentrationsof these constituants are anticipated to be below the MCLs less than 5000feet downgradient from the edge of the disposal cell. The remaining constituantsare predicted to have concentrations less than the EPA MCLs at the edgeof the disposal cell.Supplemental standards will be requested for the Cheney Reservoir Sitebecause the aquifer contains Class III groundwater. Class III groundwateris not a potential source of drinking water and is of limited beneficialuse.At the Cheney Reservoir site, the shallow aquifer would yield less than150 gallons per day to a water well because of the very limited saturatedthickness, limited areal extent, and relatively low permiability of theaquifer. A Class III designation is further justified by the fact thatbackground water quality of the aquifer is not suitable for drinking watersince background concentrations of selenium and gross alpha activity, atsome locations, exceed EPA National Primary Drinking Water Quality Standards.Table 1 shows the EPA MCL's, background concentrations, and proposed supplementalstandards for the five constituents of concern.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s100,r50,r50,r50,12</C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Proposed Supplemental Standards for the Cheney Reservoir Disposal Site</T4><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>MCLs (mg/l)</H1><H1>Background (mg/l)</H1><H1>Proposed supplemental standards (mg/l)</H1><H1>Distance to meet MCL (ft)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">AS<D>0.05</D><D>0.005</D><D>0.10</D><D>andless;5000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mo<D>0.1</D><D>0.043</D><D>0.20</D><D>andless;5000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Se<D>0.01</D><D>0.01</D><D>0.25</D><D>andless;5000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U<D>0.044</D><D>0.017</D><D>0.066</D><D>andless;5000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Gross alpha activity<D>15 pCi/l</D><D>13.9 pCi/l</D><D>26 pCi/l</D><D>andless;5000</D></ITAG></ITAG>Given these desirable natural and design features, the proposed remedialaction will comply with the EPA proposed groundwater standards at the CheneyReservoir site.Although EPA standards would also be met at the Two Roads disposal site,it is believed that relocation of the tailings to the Cheney Reservoirsite would result in fewer potential impacts. Negative impacts to threatenedand endangered species and the number of traffic accidents are expectedto be higher at the Two Roads site. Therefore, relocation of tailings tothe Cheney Reservoir site is considered the preferable alternative.In comparison to relocation to the Cheney Reservoir site and as noted inthe EIS, the no action alternative is unacceptable since, without remedialaction, the DOE cannot ensure that the tailings would not continue to bedispersed by wind, water, or man. Radiation levels at and nearby the GrandJunction site also would continue to exceed the EPA standards and contaminationof the environment would continue.In comparing relocation to the Cheney Reservoir site with stabilizationon site, the EIS indicates that relocation would result in an increasein short-term (i.e., during remedial action) environmental impacts beyondthose identified for stabilization on the Grand Junction site. These impactsinclude health effects to the remedial action worker, particulate and combustionemissions, and vehicular traffic injuries.However, also as indicated in the EIS, relocation will provide long-termenvironmental benefits in a cost-effective manner and assure total compliancewith the EPA standards. For example, health effects over 1000 years willbe much lower if tailings are disposed of at the Cheney Reservoir sitecompared to the no action alternative. In addition, the Grand Junctiontailings are within the floodplain of the Colorado River; stabilizationon site may require additional long-term site maintenance because of thetailings' proximity to the river.<ITAG tagnum="84">Considerations in the Implementation of the Decision</ITAG>The DOE is aware of the many concerns that have been expressed about theenvironmental and health impacts from the remedial action. In implementingits decision, the DOE will comply with applicable Federal reguations toavoid or minimize health and environmental impacts. The following monitoringand mitigation measures will be employed to avoid or minimize impacts duringthe remedial action:Transportation_If truck transport is selected through a competitive biddingprocess, the selected transport route descried above (9th Street to 4thAvenue to U.S. Highway 50) will include a variety of safety mitigativemeasures to minimize undue traffic congestion, damage to road surfaces,and accidents and injuries. These measures include city street upgrades,air quality monitoring, construction of on/off ramps at key locations,implementation of noise management measures, establishment of specifiedintervals between trucks, relocation of the food distribution center, routinetruck inspections, placement of additional traffic signs, regular safetytraining sessions for truck drivers formal emergency response procedures,and the restriction of hauling activities to daylight hours.If the truck/train option is selected, other mitigative measures will beimplemented including training classes, establishment of emergency responseprocedures, rail upgrades, highway widening to channel traffic at Whitewaterand Cheney Reservoir, air quality monitoring, implementation of noise managementprocedures, routine safety inspections, and for the truck portion, haulingwill be restricted to daylight hours with minimum specified intervals betweentrucks.Radiation release_The release of contaminated particulates will be reducedby dampening contaminated materials with water and/or dust suppressants,by stopping contaminated material-handling operations during adverse wheatherconditions, and by using trucks or railcars with tight-fitting seals, coversand/or chemical surfactants. Both processing and disposal sites will beshut down during the winter months.The inadvertent off-site transportation of radioactively contaminated materialwill be prevented by the use of decontamination facilities (e.g., truckand/or railcar wash stations) to clean vehicles before leaving the sites.On the Grand Junction site, waste-water streams will be monitored and treatedas necessary to meet permit requirements before off-site disposal; disturbedareas (Grand Junction and Cheney Reservoir sites) will be isolated fromsurface-water systems by erosion control methods. Human exposure to residual radioactive materials will be reduced by restrictingaccess, and by providing the monitoring and protective equipment and trainingprograms necessary for use by remedial action workers. An extensive environmentalmonitoring program will be implemented during remedial action to monitorradon and particulates in air. Air emissions_Construction areas and roads will be sprayed as requiredduring the remedial action period with water and/or a dust suppressant.Contaminated material will be transported in covered vehicles. Tailingswill not be transported, spread, or otherwise disrupted during adverseweather conditions in compliance with applicable regulations. Water contamination_To minimize impact during a flood the excavation willbe performed to minimize the exposure of contaminated material to surfacewater by the installation of protective dikes to isolate the material fromsurface-water systems. The construction of retention basins will permitthe excavated area to be dewatered and will allow collection and evaporationof waste water resulting from washing vehicles and equipment. All effluentwater will be monitored and evaporated or treated before release. The sedimentfrom the retention basins will be buried in the disposal cell at the CheneyReservior site. Water use_Sufficient water for use at the Cheney Reservior site will notbe available from an on-site well(s). Preliminary discharge test resultsfrom the exploratory production well indicate that 18 gallons per minutemay be produced from the Entrada and Wingate Sandstone at a depth of 1521to 1760 feet below land surface. The method of obtaining water for constructionat the Cheney Reservoir site is a design decision that will be made bythe Remedial Action Subcontractor. Water may be trucked to the site froma commercial water source or piped to the site from the nearby public watersupply pipeline. Since the impacts analyses are conservative and representa reasonable upper limit of their severity, additional water truck tripsare within the range of impacts predicted in the EIS. Assuming that 50percent of the water needs (36,274,000 gallons) would be delivered fromGrand Junction to the Cheney Reservoir site (36 miles round trip) by watertrucks (4000-gallon capacity), the total miles travelled (326,466 miles)is only 3.4 percent of the total vehicle miles travelled as estimated inthe EIS. Since a commercial water source is available in Whitewater (14miles round trip), it is clear that the analyses of the EIS are representativeof the ``all-water-truck scenario.'' Cultural resources_As noted in the EIS, four lithic scatters that requireadditional data to determine their eligibility to the National Registerof Historic Places (NRHP) are present in the former withdrawal area. Inaddition, portions of the amended withdrawal area and the access road havenot yet been surveyed for cultural resources. Therefore, prior to remedialaction, a Class III survey and additional testing of the lithic scatterswill be conducted. If the resources are determined to be eligible to theNRHP and would be affected by the remedial action, a data recovery planwill be designed and implemented in consultation with the State HistoricPreservation Office and the BLM. Threatened and endangered species_Pursuant to section 7 of the EndangeredSpecies Act and as indicated in the EIS, the DOE has prepared biologicalassessments for remedial actions at the Cheney Reservoir and Grand Junctionsites. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has issued a final biologicalopinion. Based on the analyses in the EIS and through consultation withthe USFWS, the remaining issues of concern are the low potential that theblack-footed ferret occurs on the Cheney Reservoir site and potential impactsto the Colorado squawfish. In response to these concerns, the DOE establishedan interagency agreement with the USFWS to conduct spotlight surveys duringthe summer of 1987, prior to remedial action, to ascertain the presenceof the ferret. The surveys found no ferrets in the area of interest. Inaddition, the DOE will not work in the Colorado River from July 1 throughSeptember 30, and will avoid use of Colorado River water at the Grand Junctionsite. Floodplains/wetlands_As shown in the floodplain and wetland assessment,limited remedial actions would take place within the 100-year floodplainof the Colorado River and in the wetlands along the river. Pursuant toExecutive Orders 11988 and 11990 , and 10 CFR Part 1022, the DOE publisheda Statement of Findings in the final EIS (Appendix G). Remedial actionswill be conducted in compliance with applicable permits and will incorporatemitigative measures to reduce impacts, including excavation during lowflow, rapid initiation of revegetation efforts, use of sediment controltechniques, and others. Details of the monitoring plans and mitigative measures specified abovewill be contained in several documents scheduled to be prepared prior toremedial action. These documents include the Remedial Action Plan (containingthe final design and specifications), the UMTRA Project Environmental,Health, and Safety Plan, and other measures that the DOE and the stateof Colorado deem appropriate pursuant to the Cooperative Agreement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>After consideration of all reasonable project alternatives, the DOE hasdecided to relocate the residual radioactive materials from the Grand Junctionsite to the Cheney Reservoir site for long-term stabilization and controlin compliance with the EPA standards.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on August 4, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Theodore J.
