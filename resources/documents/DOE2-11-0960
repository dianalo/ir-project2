Using our drop towertechnology we are pursuing two approaches: to optimize the key experimentalprocessing parameters, and to optimize the feed-stock gel composition.In the early 80's we emphasized the processing parameters, achievinggreater control and reliability over the process as well as extendingthe shell size range. More recently we have concentrated on the gel feed-stock.In this paper we report significant increases in the shell size rangeand overall wall uniformity of our shells using optimal gel feed-stock.In addition we report on-going experiments (similar to those used inindustry for quality assurance) designed to identify any significantprocessing parameters not found by our other methods. 5 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
