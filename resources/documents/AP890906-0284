Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann is expected to announce hisdecision to approve the takeover of Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbHat a news conference Friday, said the sources, speaking on conditionof anonymity.   The decision would culminate two years of haggling over one ofthe biggest corporate mergers in West German history.   Under terms of the merger approval, Daimler, already WestGermany's largest industrial concern, will shed MBB's interests inbattle tank manufacturer Krauss Maffei. Some of its board memberswill relinquish supervisory board posts at other companies.   The government also is expected to give up its interest in theEuropean Airbus Industrie project, now held through MBB, sooner thanplanned.   In addition, Deutsche Bank AG, West Germany's largest bank, willslightly lower its 28 percent shareholding in Daimler-Benz in aneffort to ease fears over the bank's dominant role in industry, thesources said.   The West German Cartel Office earlier this year voted down themerger, saying it would give Daimler a dominant position in defense,aerospace and truck manufacturing sectors.   The federal monopolies commission later voted to go along withthe proposal, but only if Daimler shed some of its defense holdings.   The economics minister also hinted to Parliament on Wednesdaythat he would approve the deal. He told the chamber that he wouldhold ``to the basic orientation of the monopolies commision'' inmaking the decision.   Haussmann has the power to override the cartel office decision ifhe determines that the merger is in the nation's economic interest.   The West German government has backed the deal as a way of easingits share of the subsidy burden in the loss-plagued Airbus program.   Even by shedding some operations, the conglomerate still will bea major global force in weapons sales and aviation technology.</TEXT></DOC>
