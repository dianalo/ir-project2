The brothers, former aides to PTL Club founder James Bakker, are the first to be convicted since a federal grand jury closed its investigation of the television ministry in January, according to a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office here.    The official wouldn't say if the trials for Mr. Bakker and former top associate Richard Dortch, who were also indicted by the grand jury, have been set.    The Taggarts, after five hours of jury deliberation, were convicted of all charges of conspiracy and tax evasion for the years 1984 through 1987. They were accused of evading more than $525,000 in income taxes after spending more than $1 million in PTL money on personal luxuries. The Taggarts maintained that Mr. Bakker gave them authority to take large cash advances and to use PTL credit cards.    Sentencing is tentatively set for Aug. 25. Each man could receive as much as 25 years in prison and be fined more than $1 million.    Attorneys for the Taggarts couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
