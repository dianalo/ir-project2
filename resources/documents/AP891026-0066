People make donations before surgery so they can use their ownblood if transfusions are needed. However, people frequently cannotproduce enough extra blood ahead of time to replace all that islost during the operation.   The research shows that the hormone erythropoietin can stimulatethe body to make more red blood cells so people can make largerdonations for themselves.   ``We have previously shown that if you ask people to storesignificant amounts of blood for themselves over a short period oftime, about 40 percent are unable to do that. As you draw bloodout, they become anemic,'' said Dr. Lawrence T. Goodnough of CaseWestern Reserve University in Cleveland.   His research, published in today's New England Journal ofMedicine, found that people getting erythropoietin increased theirblood donations by 41 percent.   The new treatment is a product of genetic engineering. The humangene that oversees production of erythropoietin is inserted intohamster tissue, which produces the human hormone in largequantities.   The protein was approved by the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration in June specifically for people suffering anemiacaused by kidney failure. However, doctors can also prescribe itfor other conditions.   In the study, 47 patients at 12 hospitals were asked to try togive up to 6 pints of blood during three weeks before electiveorthopedic surgery. They were randomly assigned to takeerythropoietin or placebos.   Only one of 23 patients getting erythropoietin could give lessthan 4 pints, compared with seven of 24 in the controlled group.   Goodnough said the treatment before surgery may be especiallysuitable for people who are small and have less blood to give andfor women, who are more prone than men to have anemia.   Doctors frequently recommend self-donations so people can avoidusing blood from other people. While ordinary transfusions arereasonably safe, recipients do run added risk of hepatitis or otherviruses as well as suffering adverse reactions to other people'sblood.</TEXT></DOC>
