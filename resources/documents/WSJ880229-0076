Effective tomorrow, -- Eagle-Picher, which stopped making asbestos insulating materials in 1971, said it is withdrawing from the Asbestos Claim Facility. The facility was established in 1985 to handle asbestos-related claims and lawsuits involving more than 30 concerns and 18 insurance companies, an Eagle-Picher spokesman said.    The company said it doesn't expect withdrawing from the Facility will affect 1988 profit.    From the 1930s through 1971, Eagle-Picher was a small producer of asbestos insulating materials. It faces claims and lawsuits brought mostly by people who were exposed to asbestos while working in shipyards and who suffer from asbestosis or other lung diseases. </TEXT></DOC>
