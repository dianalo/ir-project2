It apparently was the first time in Israel's history thatdefense was not the largest category in the budget.   The $37.8 billion 1991 budget will increase taxes and include a$3 billion deficit to cover immigration and defense costs, theFinance Ministry said.   The budget must be approved by parliament, where the governmenthas a majority.   Israeli news reports said the budget allocates $6.2 billion fordefense and $6.5 billion to cover the cost of absorbing the influxof Soviet Jewish immigrants, including construction of new housing.   About 130,000 Soviet Jews have arrived in the country so farthis year, and an additional 350,000 to 400,000 are expected toimmigrate in 1991.   The Finance Ministry would not give details of the budget'sindividual categories.   Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai and Defense Minister Moshe Arensagreed Tuesday to increase the defense budget by $215 millionbecause of the Palestinian uprising and the Persian Gulf crisis.
