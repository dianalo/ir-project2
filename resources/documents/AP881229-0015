(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A trout farmer who lost his fish-breedinglicense for importing grass-eating carp has vowed to continue hisfight to bring the white amur into the state because of its uniqueway of weeding ponds.   State wildlife officials said they dropped criminal chargesagainst Warren Candee because they failed to advise the breeder ofhis constitutional rights.   But the 75-year-old Candee is unrepentant.   ``God made these fish and if he made them to eat weeds, whyshould we use chemicals to pollute our water systems?'' he said.   The chairman of the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife saidthe agency has banned the fish and all other non-native wildlifebecause their long-term effects on the environment are unknown.   ``Mr. Candee certainly isn't a marine biologist, nor is hislawyer,'' George L. Darey said Tuesday. ``Until we're 100 percentsure that they won't have any negative effects on the environment,we will not turn these fish loose.''   Candee said he imported the fish from Arkansas and kept them in acement pond behind his house. The fish are native to the Amur River,which flows along the boarder of the Soviet Union and China.   Darey said he is awaiting the findings of a four-year studyconducted by the New York State Department of EnvironmentalConservation to determine whether Massachusetts should continue itsban against the fish.</TEXT></DOC>
