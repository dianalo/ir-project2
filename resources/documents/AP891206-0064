RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court was urged today to permitthe withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from a Missouri womandescribed as ``an unconscious shell.'' But a state lawyer said thewoman's parents have no constitutional right to order such action.   William Colby, a lawyer representing the parents of NancyCruzan, said if the permanently unconscious woman ``was lucid for amoment and could come before this court,'' she would ask that atube in her stomach providing food and water be removed.   ``Her liberty interest is as important as her right to life inthis case,'' Colby said. ``She would choose liberty.''   But Assistant Attorney General Robert L. Presson of Missourisaid the parents have no constitutional right to precipitate theirdaughter's death.   ``In this extraordinary situation, the decision should be madeby a judicial body,'' Presson said, referring to a state courtruling that the feeding tubes must be retained.   Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, the Bush administration's topcourtroom lawyer, supported Presson.   Starr urged the court to give states ``wide latitude thatreflects reasonably the wishes'' of their citizens ``in this highlysensitive and deeply vexing situation.''   There is no constitutional right to choose to die in such casesthat overrides a state's determination to require continued foodand water for unconscious patients, Starr said.   The justices, preparing for their first ``right-to-die''decision, asked extensive questions of the lawyers.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked whether a lower court thatrequired the life-support treatment for Ms. Cruzan decided the casebased on ``the best interests of the patient?''   ``I have been concerned because it's not clear what standard''the lower court set, she said.   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy told Colby, ``You presume there is aliberty to die without clear and convincing evidence'' of thepatient's wishes.   In his presentation to the justices, Colby said of Ms. Cruzan,``She is an unconscious shell in a roomful of strangers for therest of her life.''   Ms. Cruzan, 32, has been in what doctors call a persistentvegetative state for almost seven years. Her parents, Joe and JoyceCruzan, are asing the court to let them order removal of asurgically implanted tube providing her with food and water.   The Missouri Supreme Court ruled doctors may not remove the tube.   Ms. Cruzan suffered severe brain damage in a Jan. 11, 1983, carcrash. She lies in a hospital bed, her body rigid, her hands andfeet constricted and bent into claw shapes. Doctors say she cannotexperience thoughts or emotions, and that her condition isirreversible.   But Ms. Cruzan can breathe on her own and has periods when hereyes are open and move randomly.   The surgically implanted tube could keep her alive for 30 yearsor more, doctors say. Without it, she would soon die of starvationor dehydration.   Joe Cruzan, a sheet-metal worker, allowed doctors to implant thetube four weeks after his daughter's accident. He said he was toldhe could have it removed after a year if there were no improvementin her condition.   The right-to-die issue captured national headlines in 1976 whenthe New Jersey Supreme Court allowed the family of Karen AnnQuinlan to order removal of a respirator helping her breathe. Ms.Quinlan, in a similar coma-like state, continued to be fed througha tube and lived for nine more years.   American courts since generally have permitted removal oflife-sustaining treatment for such patients, relying on a 1986American Medical Association opinion that artificially suppliednutrition and hydration are medical treatments.   The AMA estimates 70 percent of Americans at some time will beinvolved in a decision about whether to provide life-sustainingmedical care for themselves or family members.   Forty-one states, including Missouri, have so-called living willlaws that allow people to pre-authorize the termination oflife-sustaining treatment. But Missouri's living-will law, whichdoes not allow for removal of feeding tubes, was not in effect whenMs. Cruzan was injured.   Her parents said she had told them she would not want to be keptalive by artificial means if ever rendered incompetent.   The Missouri Supreme Court said such statements fall well shortof the ``clear and convincing'' evidence needed to prove her realintent.   ``We choose to err on the side of life, respecting the rights ofincompetent persons who may wish to live despite a severelydiminished quality of life,'' the state court said.   Even if the justices decide there is no constitutional right todie, or that it cannot be exercised by a parent or guardian of anincompetent person, states will remain free to let doctors removelife-sustaining treatment from certain patients.   But such a ruling might prompt lower courts to make it moredifficult for physicians and family members to terminate treatment.   The Bush administration argues in a ``friend-of-the-court''brief that even a competent adult does not have an unlimited rightto refuse food and water. Justice Department lawyers said stateshave always prohibited attempted suicide, and noted some make it acrime to help a suicide.   The government said that even if a right to die exists, it doesnot extend to an incompetent person and does not outweigh ``thestate's profound interest in preserving human life.''   Anti-abortion groups also expressed support for the Missouricourt decision. It limits the privacy right that undergirds theSupreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion.   Religious groups are split over the issue.   The U.S. Catholic Conference and others say a victory for theCruzans could jeopardize the rights of the elderly or people withsevere handicaps.   The Evangelical Lutheran Church of America and others argue thatfamilies should be free of unwarranted state intrusion when makingsuch decisions.   The case is Cruzan vs. Missouri Department of Health, 88-1503.</TEXT></DOC>
