No one was injured in the pre-dawn attack and damage to thefarmhouse was minor, said the regional army commander, Gen. GeorgeMeiring. He said a limpet mine and anti-personnel mines were foundin the area.   South African officials said the attackers had entered fromZimbabwe and sent a terse message to the government of theneighboring, black-ruled state.   ``The South African government urges the Zimbabwean governmentimmediately to seek out the attackers and also wishes to state thatit reserves the right to take whatever steps it deems necessary toprevent further incursions of this nature,'' the message said.   In the past, South African forces have staged raids intoneighboring countries on suspected bases of the African NationalCongress black guerrilla movement.   Zimbabwe, like several other countries bordering South Africa,says it allows the ANC to operate politically but not militarily inits territory.   Over the past three years, ANC guerrillas occasionally haveplaced land mines on the roads of white-owned farms in SouthAfrican border areas.   About 20 whites and blacks have been killed in the attacks,which the ANC says are justified because most white farmersparticipate in an anti-guerrilla civil defense network.   During the land mine campaign, there have been few assaults onfarmhouses.   The ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting to endwhite-minority domination in South Africa.   South Africa's 5 million whites control the government andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services under alegal and traditional system of racial segregation calledapartheid. The country's 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs.   In a separate incident, police said two black municipalpolicemen were shot and seriously wounded Friday night by unknownassailants in Soweto, Johannesburg's main black township.   Black officers have been frequent targets of ANC guerrillas andanti-apartheid militants who consider them government collaborators.</TEXT></DOC>
