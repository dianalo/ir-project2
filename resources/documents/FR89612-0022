MARADis now withdrawing that NPRM because it is most unlikely that any operatorsthat may elect to suspend operating-differential subsidy (ODS) contractswill do so.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Raymond Barberesi, Office ofTrade Analysis and Insurance, Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation,Washington, DC 20590, Telephone No. (202) 366-2282.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Actof 1981 (Pub. L. 97-35), amended the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, by addinga new section 614 (Snyder Amendment). That amendment allows an operatorreceiving ODS to make an election to suspend subsidy under its ODS Agreementwith respect to all or a portion of its vessels. ODS suspension resultsin termination of all attendant statutory and contractual restrictionsin the ODS agreement, except those pertaining to the domestic trade, butrequires a pro rata repayment of any construction-differential subsidy(CDS), where applicable.MARAD issued a NPRM on August 18, 1983 (48 FR 37449), establishing proceduresthat would implement this privilege of suspending ODS agreements. Subsequently,in 1984, the Maritime Subsidy Board (Board) began consolidated proceedingsin Docket No. S-764 to consider applications by U.S.-flag subsidized bulkoperators to amend their ODS agreements to allow the carriage of preferencecargoes (U.S. government-impelled cargoes reserved to U.S.-flag vessels)without subsidy.In its Tentative Opinion and Order (September 25, 1985), tentatively grantingconditional approval of these applications, the Board found that the SnyderAmendment does not by its terms limit the Board's ability to mutually amendan ODS agreement. The Board had previously found that the amendment wasnot intended to be exclusive, which finding was upheld on Court review.The Board's Final Opinion and Order in Docket S-764 became effective onApril 15, 1986. The six bulk operators that had elected to suspend theirODS Agreements, with respect to eight vessels, had reinstated them by thatdate. Since the Board's Order did not require the repayment of CDS as acondition for amending ODS agreements for the purpose of allowing the carriageof bulk preference cargoes without subsidy, bulk operators have found thatprocedure to be a preferable alternative to suspending their ODS agreementsand repaying CDS. The operator of the only liner vessels to make an electionunder the Snyder amendment is in bankruptcy. Accordingly, since it appears most unlikely that any subsidized operatorswill elect in the future to suspend their ODS agreement pursuant to theSnyder Amendment, MARAD is hereby withdrawing its NPRM.<ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Maritime Administrator.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
