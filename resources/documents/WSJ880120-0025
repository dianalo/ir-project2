Recent trader and investor optimism that interest rates may decline significantly in coming months was defused as the Japanese government reported a widening in the nation's trade surplus last month.    As the dollar sank against the yen and other major currencies, the credit markets were further buffeted by a 0.90-point surge to 239.31 in the Commodity Research Bureau's index, a basket of 21 commodities, including crude oil, precious metals, meats, sugar, coffee and other agricultural products. It was the highest level for the spot market index since mid-1985 and signaled inflation pressure, some analysts said.    Prices of actively traded 30-year government bonds fell about half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Corporate issues were little changed as borrowers sold about $700 million of new debt, including a controversial 20-year offering of bonds by Franklin Savings Association, Kansas City, Kan., with yields pegged to the U.S. inflation rate. Municipal bond prices were mixed.    &quot;The renewed weakness in the dollar will keep foreign investors away from the U.S. market,&quot; said Gary Dorsch, senior money market analyst and commodity trading adviser at LNS Financial Group Inc. in Chicago. The surge in commodity prices &quot;obviously raises concern about inflation and makes it unlikely&quot; that the Federal Reserve &quot;will ease credit&quot; soon, he added. In the meantime, yields on long-term Treasury bonds could climb back to 9% in the days ahead from around 8.8%, he predicted.    Some analysts still expect the bond market's big rally last Friday to resume amid concern that the economic expansion is running out of steam. &quot;The stock market's weakness is telling us that a business slowdown is coming,&quot; said Roger Froehlich, president of Technical Dimensions, a market forecasting and advisory service based in Mt. Kisco, N.Y. &quot;We could see yields on 30-year Treasurys drop as low as 8 1/4% sometime in the first half,&quot; he predicted.    Whatever the case, some U.S. concerns -- worried that inflation and interest rates could climb this year -- extended the maturities in their recent borrowings to 30 years; they're even raising money in foreign currencies at substantially lower interest rates.    &quot;I think we'll see upward pressure on interest rates and pressure for a lower dollar this year because it's becoming more and more difficult for the U.S. to finance its budget deficit,&quot; said Roy Meierhenry, chief financial officer at PHH Group Inc., a corporate services specialist based in Hunt Valley, Md. PHH, which has between $50 million and $100 million outstanding in U.S. commercial paper denominated in foreign currencies, recently became one of the first U.S. companies to sell commercial paper denominated in Japanese yen.    &quot;In terms of cost,&quot; the yen issue &quot;was advantageous compared with similar paper in dollars,&quot; Mr. Meierhenry said. The novel borrowing was made possible by the recent removal of financing restrictions in yen by the Japanese Ministry of Finance.    &quot;The move is significant because it comes at a time when people are looking to diversify their investments and borrowings away from the dollar and into another potential global reserve currency, such as the yen,&quot; said Timothy O'Neill, a vice president and foreign exchange specialist at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. Goldman arranged the yen-based PHH commercial paper sale.    As in its other foreign currency-denominated commercial paper sales, PHH exchanged its yen obligation for a relatively cheap dollar obligation through the so-called interest rate and currency swap markets.    In the credit markets yesterday, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 fell to 100 5/8 from 101 1/8 last Friday, while the yield rose to 8.81% from 8.77%. An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. declined 5.91 points to 1270.12. The index ranged between 1267.04 and 1273.24. The Treasury's 8 7/8% notes due 1997 declined to 101 19/32 from 101 27/32 while the yield edged up to 8.63% from 8.59% Friday.    Among short-term borrowing costs, the rate on federal funds, or reserves banks lend each other overnight, averaged 6.94%, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A). That was up from 6.89% Friday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said. The U.S. government securities market was closed Monday, a national holiday.    The average rate on the Treasury's latest three-month bills auctioned yesterday was 5.98%, up from 5.85% at the prior auction last week. The average rate on the Treasury's six-month bills auctioned yesterday was 6.37%, up from 6.33% at last week's auction.    In the corporate new-issue market yesterday, Franklin Savings Association, a thrift institution, became the first U.S. corporation to publicly sell long-term bonds with a yield based on inflation. The $150 million issue was priced at par to yield 7 1/2% initially, with the coupon reset quarterly three percentage points above the 12-month percentage change in the unadjusted consumer price index. The bonds are due in 20 years.    &quot;I think it's highly likely we'll do more of these deals,&quot; said Robert Scott, a managing director at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., which is managing the underwriting. &quot;This is either fantastic or terrible, depending on who you talked to yesterday on the telephone,&quot; he said of such index-linked securities.    Morgan Stanley said the issue is expected to be rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. as a result of collateral backing the bonds.    Inflation-indexed securities, a popular form of financing by the British government after double-digit inflation threatened the British economy 10 years ago, could prove attractive for so-called buy and hold investors here seeking a guaranteed return over the U.S. inflation rate. At the moment, however, the current yield on the Franklin bonds is more than a percentage point less than the Treasury's 10-year note. Other underwriters of the Franklin issue said demand for the new offering wasn't robust.    &quot;You've got to work hard to explain the concept,&quot; said Mr. Scott of Morgan Stanley.    Yesterday's other large corporate offerings included:   --A $250 million issue of Citicorp notes due January 1993. Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets priced the 9 3/8% notes at 99.896% to yield 9.4%, or 1.22 percentage points more than the Treasury's five-year note. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's and double-A by Sandamp;P.    --A $250 million issue of BP America sinking-fund debentures due January 2018. Underwriters led by Morgan Stanley priced the 9 7/8% notes at 98.30 to yield 10.055%, or 1.25 percentage points more than the Treasury's 30-year bond. The issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody's and double-A by Sandamp;P.    --A $100 million issue of Ryder System Inc. notes due January 1998. Underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. priced the 9 3/8% notes at 99 1/2 to yield 9.453%, or 0.82 of a percentage point more than the Treasury's 10-year note. The issue is rated single-A-2 by Moody's and single-A by Sandamp;P.    In the municipal market, a $118 million issue of Birmingham, Ala., general obligation refunding bonds was tentatively priced to yield 6.5% from 1996 to 8% in 2015. The bonds are expected to be rated single-A-1 by Moody's and double-A by Sandamp;P, according to underwriters led by Smith Barney Harris Upham andamp; Co.    Here are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                               13-Week             26-Week Applications .......... $26,045,315,000     $23,233,395,000 Accepted bids .......... $6,424,895,000      $6,410,365,000 Accepted at low price ............. 59%                 17% Accepted noncompet'ly .... $927,705,000        $697,960,000 Average price (Rate) .... 98.488(5.98%)       96.780(6.37%) High price (Rate) ....... 98.496(5.95%)       96.815(6.30%) Low price (Rate) ........ 98.488(5.98%)       96.775(6.38%) Coupon equivalent ............... 6.17%               6.69%   Both issues are dated Jan. 21.
