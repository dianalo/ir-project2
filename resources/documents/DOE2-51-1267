<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-51-1267 </DOCNO><TEXT>Critical current densities and resistivities were measured in a singlecrystal of the high T/sub c/ superconductor Bi{sub 2}Sr{sub 2}CaCu{sub2}O{sub 8} within the ab basal plane (parallel) and along the c direction(perpendicular). A large anisotropy in critical current density is found,J/sub c//sub parallel//J/sub c//sub perpendicular/{approx_equal}10{sup3}, in quantitative agreement with the large normal-state resistivityanisotropy near T/sub c/. The data provide strong evidence for a two-dimensionallayered structure of metallic planes separated by semi-insulating barriers.</TEXT></DOC>
