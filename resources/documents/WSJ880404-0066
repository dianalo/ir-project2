In a brief order, Justice Byron White in Washington said he had not been informed that the combination was already completed before he took action Thursday.    Justice White initially stayed an order by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. The appeals court had reversed a lower court's injunction preventing the two companies from combining their photofinishing operations.    The injunction was issued after Phototron Corp., a San Bernardino, Calif.-based wholesale photofinisher, filed suit seeking in part to block the Kodak-Fuqua transaction. The suit alleged anti-trust violations.    Phototron couldn't be reached for comment Friday on Justice White's action. </TEXT></DOC>
