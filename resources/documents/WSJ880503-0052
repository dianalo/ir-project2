The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which dropped about nine points Friday, advanced 10.94 to 2043.27 yesterday as large-capitalization stocks began to attract buyers late in the session.    The average outperformed broader market measures by a wide margin. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 0.23 to 261.56, while the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index dropped 0.04 to 147.83. Some 875 Big Board issues declined, while only 617 advanced.    Aside from dividend-related trading in selected issues, activity dropped below the modest levels that prevailed last week, the slowest non-holiday week on the Big Board in about 18 months.    Volume on the Big Board rose slightly to 136.5 million shares from 135.6 million Friday, but dividend plays in Central andamp; South West, Union Carbide and Merrill Lynch inflated yesterday's total. The three stocks topped the list of the Big Board's most active issues, and their composite volume totaled about 24 million shares.    Stock prices drifted at lower levels for much of the session, but traders said investors were encouraged by the drop in oil prices resulting from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' failure to agree with several nonmember producers on a plan for cutting output. June crude oil futures plunged 85 cents a barrel to $17.14 in New York trading.    &quot;Any time you get a huge fall in oil prices, it's beneficial for stocks,&quot; said Mark Loehr, a vice president and trader at First Boston Corp. The Dow Jones Transportation Average added 11.79 to 853.79 as airline and trucking issues responded favorably to the price downturn.    Despite the sluggish performance yesterday, analysts said they were impressed that stock prices didn't follow the slide in bond prices. Bonds fell on news that March factory orders were stronger than expected and February orders were revised upward.    Jack Solomon, a technical analyst at Bear Stearns andamp; Co., said the drop in crude oil prices eased the widespread fears among equity investors that inflation will begin to accelerate, forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. &quot;There's just not too much urgent fear of inflation,&quot; he said.    In addition, he said, selling pressure has been largely absent from the market lately, even during periods of weakness. &quot;So many people have gotten out already that it seems sold out. It just seems easier for it to go up than down,&quot; he said.    As a result, he said, the stock market may be able to start moving more independently of the bond market, which has been hurt by evidence that the economy remains robust.    But Mary Farrell, a market analyst at Paine Webber, said the relationship between bonds and stocks is likely to continue to confine any movements in stock prices well within the trading range that has prevailed since last October's crash.    With the yield on the Treasury's long bond at its highest level of the year, she said that long-term interest rates are too high to allow stocks to stage much of a rally. At the same time, she said, short-term rates &quot;are not too high to be negative&quot; for stock prices.    When combined with the fact that stocks appear to be fairly valued at current levels, she said, the prospects for a significant move in prices and an increase in trading activity are slight. &quot;People don't see much risk, but they don't see much opportunity either,&quot; she said.    OPEC's inability to agree on production cutbacks caused oil stocks to slide. Exxon eased 1/4 to 44 5/8; Chevron dipped 1/2 to 47 1/2; Texaco fell 1/2 to 49 5/8; Mobil dropped 1/2 to 46 1/4 and Royal Dutch Petroleum declined 1 3/8 to 121. Atlantic Richfield slipped 1 3/8 to 87 1/4, though the company reported that its first-quarter net income jumped to $2.20 a share from $1.31 a year earlier.    Allegis advanced 2 3/8 to 84 3/8 in reaction to both the drop in oil prices and the news that it will receive $500 million for the sale of a 50% stake in its Apollo computer reservation system. Elsewhere in the airline sector, AMR gained 1 1/8 to 44 1/4; Delta Air Lines climbed 1 1/4 to 49 3/4 and NWA rose 1 1/4 to 41 3/8.    Among trucking stocks, Arkansas Best rose 7 1/8 to 23. Two New York-based investment partnerships said they plan a joint takeover bid of $20 a share for the company. Also, Carolina Freight added 2 3/8 to 23 3/8 and Consolidated Freightways gained 1/4 to 27 7/8.    United Brands jumped 3 to 51 1/2. The company reported that its first-quarter net income rose to $1.22 a share from 91 cents a year earlier. Separately, the company declared a 3-for-1 stock split.    LeaRonal surged 2 7/8 to 19 1/8. The company said it has held preliminary talks with and furnished certain information to Asarco in connection with a possible takeover proposal. Asarco gained 1/8 to 23 7/8.    USG gained 1/2 to 41 1/2. Desert Partners said it would boost its takeover offer to $45 a share from $42 if USG would negotiate a merger agreement that provides for redemption of a &quot;poison pill&quot; anti-takeover measure.    RTE Corp. advanced 3/8 to 41. The company rejected a $36-a-share takeover bid from Mark IV Industries and said it is holding talks with third parties about a higher offer. Mark IV finished unchanged at 11 7/8.    The American Stock Exchange Index, which includes a number of oil stocks, fell 0.68 to 302.46.    Moog Inc. Class A dropped 5/8 to 11 3/8. The company posted fiscal second-quarter net income of four cents a share, which reflected a $7 million charge and a $3.2 million gain, compared with net from continuing operations of 30 cents a share a year earlier. In response, Moog said it imposed a cost-cutting program calling for reductions in executive salaries, a hiring freeze and a staff cutback.    Bolar Pharmaceutical dropped 3/8 to 24 1/2, though the company reported first-quarter net rose to 35 cents a share from 16 cents a year earlier.    On the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite index gained 0.51 to 379.74. </TEXT></DOC>
