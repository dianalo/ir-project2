By a 60-39 vote, the Senate adopted an amendment thatstripped from the pending highway bill a provision that wouldhave sped the removal of billboards by allowing cities andstates to compensate the signs' owners over a period of yearsrather than with an upfront cash payment. The provision alsowould have barred new billboard construction on federallysubsidized highways.</LP><TEXT>   Sen. Harry Reid (D., Nev.), who proposed the amendment,argued that the anti-billboard provision threatened to putthe outdoor-advertising industry out of business and that itwould have idled thousands of workers. He also contended thatit would have deprived billboard owners of their propertywithout fair payment, a violation of the Fifth Amendment tothe Constitution.   &quot;What is involved here is the right of a legitimatebusiness to do business and to own property,&quot; Sen. Reid said.   Sen. John Chafee (R., R.I.), the provision's main backer,said it was &quot;nonsense&quot; to suggest the billboard industrywould crumble if the provision was approved. He argued thatit was needed to implement the anti-billboard laws already onthe books.   Sen. Chafee defended the provision as a proper way toremove the almost 100,000 billboards along the interstatehighway system and other primary highways that don't conformto the law. But he added that thousands of billboards stillwould remain after those signs were removed.   The billboard provision would have banned new billboardsalong federally subsidized highways and would have allowedlocal governments to remove signs that didn't conform withzoning rules without paying a cash compensation. Under theprovision, the billboards could have been removed through aprocess known as amortization; the signs would come downafter a specific period during which the owner would receiveincome from advertisers renting the sign.   The vote came as the Senate continued to debate its $105billion surface transportation authorization bill, which isone of President Bush's domestic priorities.</TEXT></DOC>
