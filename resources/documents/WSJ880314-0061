But some of those paid to give fund managers advice think they could be wrong.    A survey of U.K. institutional fund managers found most expect London stocks to be flat after the fiscal 1989 budget is announced, as Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson strikes a careful balance between cutting taxes and not overstimulating the economy.    A similar survey of equity analysts showed generally more bullish sentiment. Some expect the budget announcement to boost shares across the board; others say the action will be concentrated in certain sectors, particularly consumer-oriented issues, which could benefit more than others depending on the size and nature of the government's &quot;tax giveaway.&quot;    Economists widely expect Mr. Lawson to present personal tax cuts of between three billion pounds and four billion pounds ($7.4 billion) while issuing a budget in balance or slightly in surplus for the year beginning April 1.    Because the U.K. economy is growing rapidly, observers say the chancellor is likely to avoid too large a tax giveaway to avoid aggravating what some believe is an overheated situation. </TEXT></DOC>
