The objectivecogeneration systems should be compatible to the urban needs such ashigh efficiency cogeneration without ineffective heat and electric powersupply, saving of the space required for the system, satisfaction ofenvironmental requirements, and so on. For hotels, hospitals, etc., a100 - 500 kW gas engine, 500 - 1500 kW gas turbine cogeneration systemshould be developed with the objective total efficiency above 80%. Forthe gas engine, a high-diluted gas combustion system of high efficiencyand low NOx concentration, enhancement of partial load management, heat/electricpower ratio control techniques, miniaturization of the system shouldbe realized. An absorption refrigerator which utilizes high temperatureengine-cooling waste heat (double waste heat utilization) or waste heatof ordinary temperature cooling water (single waste heat utilization)should be developed. For the gas turbine, high efficiency techniquesshould be developed to realize a high heat resistant turbine blade forelevation of the turbine intake temperature, waste heat recycling, recoveredsteam spraying to the combustor for enhancement of the output, and soon. The basic plan, the element development, and the apparatus unit teststarted in F.Y. 1987, and the system development is to be completed inF.Y. 1992. (4 figs, 3 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
