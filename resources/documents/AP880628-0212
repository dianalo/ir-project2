North the chanceto prove that his congressional testimony was illegally usedagainst him by prosecutors.   Lawyers for the fired White House aide charged that U.S.District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell ``placed speed before fundamentalfairness'' by ruling the case should go to trial without furtherproceedings on the issue of congressional immunity given North andtwo co-defendants.   Gesell's procedures for conducting his inquiry and the reasoningbehind his conclusions ``are most notable for their arbitrariness,their superficiality, and their unprecedented denial of dueprocess,'' said the brief filed by North's lawyers, Brendan V.Sullivan Jr. and Barry Simon.   ``The procedures employed stand as a striking departure fromthis court's long tradition of fair and even-handed adjudication,''the brief said in one of several scathing attacks on the judge'shandling of the immunity question.   North, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter andarms dealer Albert Hakim all claimed that independent counselLawrence E. Walsh made impermissible use of the testimony they gavecongressional hearings last year under grants of limited immunityfrom prosecution.   Gesell has rejected defense motions to dismiss charges againstthe three on the ground that Walsh's investigation was tainted byexposure to widespread publicity of the trio's congressionaltestimony.   To counter some of the legal problems posed by immunity, Gesellalso ordered that North, Poindexter, Hakim and retired Air ForceMaj. Gen. Richard V. Secord be tried separately on charges ofconspiring to illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran armssales to the Nicaraguan rebels.   Secord testified on Capitol Hill without an immunity grant.   In their latest pleading, North's lawyers said they found ``mostshocking'' the judge's ``outright refusal'' to allow the defense topresent witnesses at an April 25 hearing to determine whetherWalsh's staff was exposed to congressional testimony.   The judge was also criticized for abruptly canceling asubsequent hearing on the issue of whether the defendants'immunized congressional testimony was used by government lawyers toprepare federal officials before appearances before the Iran-Contragrand jury.   At the outset of the April 25 hearing, Gesell said he would notallow the defense to present testimony because it had violated hisorders by subpoenaing government officials and a wide range ofdocuments for the proceeding.   Gesell abruptly canceled the June 13 hearing after similarsubpoenas for documents were issued by defense lawyers. In bothcases, the judge quashed the subpoenas at the request of Walsh.   In their latest filing, North's lawyers said they had evidencethat attorneys for the CIA, the White House and the State andJustice departments ``relied upon the immunized testimony'' toprepare government officials for questioning by the Iran-Contragrand jury.   Evidence to support this claim was filed under seal by thedefense lawyers.   In his June 16 opinion, Gesell said his findings on the immunityissue were provisional and depended on what happened during North'strial. The judge said he would convene a post-trial hearing on theissue if such a proceeding were necessary.   In an separate and highly unusual motion, North's lawyers movedto strike from the record Gesell's ``unjustified criticism ofdefense counsel'' during a June 6 hearing.   During the proceeding, Gesell said defense lawyers had not toldthe court that Secord had been inteviewed 10 times by Walsh'soffice. Gesell said he had ``discovered it buried in a footnote ina brief.''   When Secord's attorney, Thomas Green, told the judge that no oneattempted to mislead the court, Gesell replied: ``I didn't suggestyou did. I said that I was surprised that you did.''   In their pleading, North's lawyers said Gesell had been informedof Secord's meetings with Walsh's staff on three previous occasions.</TEXT></DOC>
