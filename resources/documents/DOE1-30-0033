In the study on monosilane production,the monosilane production chamber failed to show the expected capacityfor a short period operation test. However, as to the rest of the plannedsubjects, achivement of the target capacity was found promising withthe exception of minor field. Long continuous operational tests totaling700 hours were carried out. The efficiency of monosilane production wasas low as about 63% against electrolytic current. Study was made to solveproblems, and the monosilane production test equipment was improved onthe fused salt electrolysis reaction tank, production and supply of silicontetrachloride, and electrolytic dissociation and refinement device ofmonosilane. For operation control and efficiency improvement, promotionof automation and improvement of efficiency were studied. As to the evaluationtechnology for monosilane, improvement in accuracy of impurity analysisand evaluation test relating produced monosilane were performed.</TEXT></DOC>
