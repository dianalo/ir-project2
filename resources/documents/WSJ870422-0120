Japanese diplomats say they are puzzled by a series of Chinese diplomatic and economic complaints that seem to have grown more intense since the ouster of Hu Yaobang as China's Communist Party leader in mid-January. The mercurial party boss had built up a personal relationship with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that, in the words of one diplomat here, had helped make Mr. Hu Japan's &quot;friend in high places.&quot;    Adds a Japanese diplomat: &quot;To some extent, it's true that Mr. Hu played the role of a bridge between China and Japan.&quot;    Because of that relationship, some Japanese diplomats and businessmen believe the growing number of Sino-Japanese irritants stems directly from Mr. Hu's resignation. &quot;The Japanese believe that if Hu had been there, it would have cushioned the effect,&quot; of any disagreements, says a Western diplomat in the Chinese capital.    Not that the Japanese have a lot to worry about. They continue to dominate China trade, hogging one-third of the country's two-way trade. Chinese figures show Japan had a $7.72 billion trade surplus with China in 1986, selling goods valued at $12.46 billion while buying only $4.74 billion worth. China has become the second-biggest market for Japanese exports after the U.S.    That's probably the problem. As Japan's trade surpluses with China have grown in recent years, Beijing has warned repeatedly it couldn't afford to let that situation continue for too long. Indeed, whether by luck or intent, Japan's 1986 trade surplus with China was about $800 million less than in 1985, and its exports to China fell an additional 14% in the first three months of this year. Japanese companies also have begun to increase investments, a trend that could ease another sore point with the Chinese, who have noted that U.S. investment in the People's Republic far outweighs that from Japan.    Even so, diplomatic squabbles between China and Japan have been on the increase. China reacted strongly, for example, when Japan announced about 10 days after Mr. Hu's ouster in January that it was abandoning its long-held policy of restricting defense spending to 1% of gross national product. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping complained directly to Noburo Takeshita, secretary general of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party. &quot;To be candid, the Chinese people are nervous about Japanese defense expenditure,&quot; Mr. Deng said.    The Chinese also protested a Japanese court ruling in February that awarded a Chinese students' dormitory in Kyoto to Taiwan rather than to the mainland, even though Beijing is recognized as China's government by Tokyo, Washington and most other governments.    The Chinese Foreign Ministry called on the Japanese government to intervene against what it called an &quot;illegal act&quot; that disregarded international law. Japan replied that it couldn't interfere with the actions of its court.    The latest blow came last weekend, when Mr. Deng was quoted as telling a Hong Kong group that Japan was a &quot;chauvinist country&quot; and warning of &quot;growing Japanese militarism.&quot; The quotes appeared in Hong Kong's English-language South China Morning Post. There has been no official Chinese account of the alleged remarks, and Japanese officials say they have a hard time believing Mr. Deng actually made them.    China also has complained bitterly about Japanese attempts to rewrite textbook histories of Japan's imperialistic past to soften accounts of atrocities committed by the Japanese military against Chinese, Koreans and others. The Chinese have never been completely comfortable with Japan, which, starting a century ago and until the end of World War II, repeatedly coveted Chinese territory and was responsible for the deaths of millions of Chinese. There also is nervousness about Japan's current economic might.    Some Japanese contend that the Sino-Japanese irritants of the past several months are just a matter of bad timing. The dormitory case, for example, was initiated a decade ago and just happened to be settled shortly after Mr. Hu's downfall.    Other Asian diplomats also think the brouhaha doesn't amount to a hill of beans. &quot;There are historical antagonisms,&quot; says one. &quot;But they {the Chinese} realize that you can't say your policies aren't changing and then start a fight with the Japanese. Japan is too important for their modernization effort. It's a big market -- even with the deficit.&quot;    Notes another Asian observer: &quot;The problem China has with Japan is the problem we all have with Japan-trade deficits, lack of transfer of technology, Japanese business practices.&quot; This diplomat ascribes China's harsher attitude toward Japan to the power play under way between so-called conservatives and reformers in the Chinese leadership: &quot;I think Deng Xiaoping always tries to protect his flank from the opposition. The opposition says, 'You're tying our fortunes to the Japanese.' He can reply, 'Look, I'm kicking them in the teeth.' Deng has his domestic audience, especially the conservative opposition, in mind.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
