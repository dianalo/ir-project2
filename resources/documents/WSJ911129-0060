Rio Algom attributed its decision, among other things, toa 20% drop in uranium prices since the agreement was reachedin May, and to &quot;Soviet dumping&quot; of uranium.   A spokesman for Rio Algom declined to say whether taxproblems had affected the decision. Uranium Resourcesofficials said in September that an unforseen wrinkle inCanadian tax law might cause Rio Algom to pay more tax on thetransaction than it had earlier anticipated. Officialsweren't available to comment.</TEXT></DOC>
