LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said Friday thatwithout $179 million gained because of an accounting change, thecompany would have recorded a $10 million loss in first-quarter netearnings.   Reduction of the company's deferred tax liability through theadoption of a new accounting standard had the effect of adding the$179 million, or $4.68 a share, after taxes, the St. Louis-basedcompany said.   Excluding that benefit, the company reported a loss in netearnings for the quarter of $10 million, or 25 cents a share, onrevenue of $3.4 billion, compared with net earnings of $51 million,or $1.33 a share, on revenue of $3.31 billion for the same periodlast year.   Earnings were depressed by an operating loss of $66 million inthe company's transport aircraft segment and a special provisionfor interest on taxes related to a dispute with the InternalRevenue Service over the timing of tax obligations, the companysaid.   In addition, the company said there was a 15 percent reductionin operating earnings from combat aircraft.   Contributing to the operating loss in transport aircraft was amajor reorganization of the Douglas Aircraft Co. initiated in thefirst quarter to provide long-term improvements in operations. Thetransition caused some disruption and ineffeciences, the companysaid.   Operating earnings in the combat aircraft segment declined as aresult of decreased performance in the manufacturing process, thecompany said.   Total interest expense in the aerospace and information systemssegments increased from $41 million in the first quarter of lastyear to $99 million this year.   The company said that while that was due partly to higherinterest rates and increased corporate borrowings, a large portionof it related to a special provision for resolving tax issues.   The corporation and the IRS have disagreed over the completiondates of long-term contracts. Settlement with the IRS may result ininterest and previously deferred taxes being paid to the IRS, thecompany said.</TEXT></DOC>
