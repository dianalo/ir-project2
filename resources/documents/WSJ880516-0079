The Florida banking giant is also seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the opening of a branch unit of Consolidated Bank in West Palm Beach, which lies in a different county from the bank's home base of Hialeah.    Florida law prohibits operation of a bank outside of the home county of the bank, except by merger, acquisition, or by chartering a new bank. In the past decade, Barnett has spent many millions of dollars to develop a statewide network through the traditional methods of chartering new banks or acquiring existing ones, a far costlier method than branching across county lines.    Barnett, which has $23.8 billion in assets, said it opposes the comptroller's approval last week of Consolidated's branching request because it is &quot;an attempt to supersede the state's right to regulate branch banking.&quot;    Consolidated, which has $860 million in assets, opened the new branch inside a supermarket Thursday. It is the first Florida bank to be granted approval from the comptroller to form a branch outside its home county since Jackson, Miss.-based Deposit Guaranty National Bank received the first such approval in 1985. Since then, the comptroller has approved 31 of the 82 applications it has received. A spokeswoman for the comptroller's office said she couldn't comment on pending litigation.    &quot;Our position is that we will defend the opening of the branch all the way up,&quot; said Carlos Fernandez, a spokesman for Consolidated. Mr. Fernandez said Consolidated has received strong support from small and midsize banks across Florida.    Mr. Fernandez said the high costs of acquisition and chartering of banks and the competition from state-chartered savings and loans associations makes &quot;branching the most logical business way to penetrate a new market.&quot;    Consolidated's move is likely to be followed by many others. Florida's comptroller, who opposes the federal action on the grounds that federal regulators shouldn't interfere with state banking regulations, has introduced a bill in the legislature that would permit state banks to branch across county lines 45 days after the opening of Consolidated's branch. </TEXT></DOC>
