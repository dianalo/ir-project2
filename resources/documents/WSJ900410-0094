The document is to be signed tomorrow at the end of thefour-week long Conference on Economic Cooperation in Europe.It merges key elements of U.S. and European Communityproposals, both of which focused strongly on East bloccountries' needs to turn their economies around in Westernfashion.   According to the communique, the 35 participating nations-- the U.S., Canada and all European countries except Albania-- acknowledge that &quot;increased reliance on market forces&quot;should improve economic performance. In addition, thecommunique commits nations to either implement or maintain awide range of free-market-style reforms.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN KUWAIT                                                                                                          Kuwait's cabinet approved legislation that for the firsttime enables foreign residents to invest in Kuwaiti companiesthrough investment funds. Kuwait's minister of state forcabinet affairs, Rashed Abdul-Aziz al-Rashed, said thatnon-Kuwaitis, subject to certain rules, will be allowed touse the funds to invest in local equities and real estate.Economists and bankers said the measure was part of recentgovernment attempts to revitalize the local economy.

DISPOSABLE LIGHTER INQUIRY                                                                                                          The European Community's executive commission has begun aninquiry into imports of disposable lighters from China, SouthKorea and Thailand after receiving a complaint from theEuropean Federation of Lighter Manufacturers. The federationalleged that the Asian manufacturers charge less for theirlighters in the EC than they do in their domestic markets; asa result, the Asians' unit sales in the 12-nation market roseto 55.7 million in 1988 from 22 million in 1986. The Asianshad 22% of the market in 1988, valued at seven millionEuropean currency units ($8.4 million).                                                                                                          RESTORING FRANCE'S GARDENS                                                                                                          France's Culture Minister Jack Lang launched a $122million project to restore some of the nation's most famouspublic gardens. The project will involve restoring Paris'sTuileries, which the daily Le Monde recently described as adusty repository for unwanted statues. &quot;The idea with theTuileries is to make it . . . so beautiful that it gives amessage of hope to a world asphyxiated by pollution,&quot; saidMarc Simonet-Lenglart, a gardening historian in charge of theproject.                                                                                                          HELPING SOUTH AFRICA'S BLACKS                                                                                                          Liberty Life Association of Africa Ltd., one of SouthAfrica's largest life insurers, announced the formation of anew social foundation to help the black community. Thefoundation will, over a period of five years, spend over 100million rand (about $38 million) in such areas as improvingeducational facilities, housing and support for blackentrepreneurs.                                                                                                          SWEDISH MILK BLOCKADE                                                                                                          Heavily subsidized Swedish farmers, fearing a reduction ingovernment support, blocked milk and other dairyproduct-deliveries to shops across the country. A spokesmanfor the Federation of Swedish Farmers said farmers picketeddairy plants, stopped trucks from making regular pickups andleft shops without fresh supplies. He said he wasn't sure howlong the protest would last. Farmers fear that the SocialDemocratic government, shifting towards emphasis on high-techindustries with high export earnings, will decreaseagriculture support.                                                                                                          JAPANESE MERGERS                                                                                                          In the first three months of 1990, Japanese companies wereinvolved in a total of 209 merger and acquisition cases,suggesting that the total for the year could surpass the 660cases recorded in all of 1989, according to a survey byYamaichi Securities Co.   The survey included mergers and acquisitions by Japanesecorporations domestically and overseas, as well asacquisitions of Japanese concerns by foreign enterprises.Japanese companies purchased 126 foreign firms in the period,according to the report, while foreign companies acquired ormerged with only two Japanese companies.
