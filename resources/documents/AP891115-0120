(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Matchmakers think the timing is right tointroduce a widower to a partially blind potential mate.   Syracuse's Burnet Park Zoo plans to introduce its recentlywidowed bald eagle to a bird from Florida, according to KenReininger, curator of birds at the zoo. The Florida bird wascaptured by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service after it lost an eyeto a shotgun pellet.   ``We do expect to have her before the weather gets cold,'' hesaid. ``It's a perfect time of year to try this type of thing.''   The zoo's previous female bald eagle died of a heart attack inMay during a crucial egg-tending period. The male eagle tended theeggs and took over the parental responsibilities. The onlysurviving chick was removed later that month and given to wildfoster parents.   Reininger said the male eagle hasn't been lonely since the deathof his mate and the departure of his chick.   ``(Loneliness) doesn't make much sense evolution-wise,'' hesaid. ``He just continued on with his life. He's just not thatshortsighted.''</TEXT></DOC>
