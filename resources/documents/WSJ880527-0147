Wrapping yourself in the flag is a strategy as old as American politics, though some politicians do it better than others. John Kenneth White, an associate professor of political science at SUNY Potsdam, considers how recent politicians -- Republicans, most successfully -- have used the flag, the family, and other good things, and how other politicians -- he seems to hope, Democrats -- might use them this year and beyond.    The subject of Mr. White's &quot;The New Politics of Old Values,&quot; (University Press of New England, 188 pages, $18) is a big one, and Mr. White makes it still bigger by considering it under the rubric of &quot;values.&quot;    The Founding Fathers, of course, did not believe in &quot;values,&quot; but in &quot;truths.&quot; Values are much larger and looser things -- they can plausibly be discerned in anything anyone finds valuable -- and so we follow Mr. White through much pop-cultural lint-picking: the evolution of Maj. Houlihan on MASH (she got smarter); the number of nude shots in Playboy (they're getting fewer). But along the way, he draws together facts, chiefly polling data and political rhetoric, which present a profile of the '80s.    Mr. White cites polls showing that in 1980 distress over certain social phenomena was much greater among average Americans than among their leaders. Homosexuality, abortion, pot and promiscuous sex drew hefty displeasure from the sample as a whole, but only scant disapproval from business, government and professional elites.    One possible remedy was to change elites, at least on the government side. The Reagan campaign accordingly began planning, as early as 1979, a &quot;strategy of values&quot; (that word again) consisting of &quot;charges that the Carter policies {had} eroded American family values.&quot; Jimmy Carter, of course, made his own pitch for flag and family, as did Walter Mondale four years later. They failed partly because of incompetence. One of Mr. White's interesting factoids sheds light on the comparative savvy of Democratic and Republican strategists. The brains behind the New Coke campaign, it turns out, belonged to Democratic pollster Pat Caddell. When that went flat, the Coca-Cola company switched to the firm of Republican Richard Wirthlin.    But the Democrats also failed for ideological reasons. Mr. Reagan always hung his moral/political sermonettes on stories about individuals, often fictionalized (the historical Gipper, for whom Mr. Reagan always urged folks to win one, was actually a bit of a bum). The Democrats made few such appeals. Their world view forbade it. &quot;In the Carter administration, it was groups, not individuals, that received most of the kudos. Carter feted the victorious U.S. hockey team after the 1980 Winter Olympics, singling out no one for meritorious praise.&quot;    Jesse Jackson, as might be expected, expressed the Democratic group ethos most vividly. &quot;America is like a quilt -- many patches, many pieces, many colors. . . . The white, the Hispanic, the black, the Arab, the Jew, the woman, the native American, the small farmer, the business person, the environmentalist, the peace activist, the young, the old, the lesbian, the gay, and the disabled make up the American quilt.&quot; It got so that &quot;to view the United States as a collection of individuals became equated&quot; in Democratic minds, says Mr. White, &quot;with selfishness.&quot;    By midsummer, we will have a better idea of how George Bush and Michael Dukakis plan to fight for the symbolic legacy. But some tactics are already evident.    Mr. Dukakis's biggest investment in &quot;old values&quot; is his son-of-immigrants portfolio. He regularly reminds audiences that his family is a classic American success story. Apart from that, he prefers to rest his nonideological claims to the office almost entirely on the question of competence. This has the advantage of cleansing him of that great peril for post-McGovern Democrats, the whiff of Freak House: what Chuck Colson dubbed, &quot;acid, amnesty, and abortion.&quot;    Republican political operatives, when you speak to them, are confident they can pin the triple A rating on the Duke. In the New York primary, Sen. Albert Gore broke ground for them by raising the issue of Massachusetts's dotty prison furlough program. They also cite Mr. Dukakis's resolute support of gay rights and abortion.    The GOP seems primed, in other words, for a replay of &quot;old values&quot; themes. But a paradox arises. Mr. Bush never was strongly identified with the social conservative wing of the party. Mr. Reagan himself, when he got in office, put its issues on the back burner.    Will the traditionally inclined northern blue collars and low-rent southern WASPs rally to yet another call, from those who have been doing more calling than acting? If the race is tight, which it seems it may be, their decision may determine whether the music for the inaugural ball is Peter Duchin or bouzoukis.    ---   Mr. Brookhiser is a senior editor of National Review. </TEXT></DOC>
