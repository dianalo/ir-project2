They've seen it all before,&quot; he says.</LP><TEXT>   The 47-year-old Mr. Dunkelberg, one of the country's bestknown small-business economists, still sees little to makehim abandon his usual optimistic outlook for small business.His views enjoy a wide following. Currently dean of TempleUniversity's School of Business and Management, Mr.Dunkelberg is also chief economist of the National Federationof Independent Business, the country's largest small-businessgroup. He produces the federation's influential quarterlyeconomic report for small business.   In a recent interview, Mr. Dunkelberg discussed prospectsfor small companies in today's economic climate:                                                                                                          Q. Given the growth in business failures lately, is smallbusiness facing an economic recession?   A. No. Economic activity among small businesses looks toostrong to produce a recession this year.   The economy has just gone through an unprecedentedexpansion and this growth created an unrealistic exuberance.When reality set in, many firms found that the marketsweren't big enough to support all of the new entrants andthat the high growth rates, in fact, wouldn't go on forever.   High rates of growth invariably produce high failure rateswhen the economy begins to adjust itself. But that doesn'tmean that small business isn't healthy.                                                                                                          Q. But isn't overall business activity slowing down?   A. Yes. But the slowdown is relative to peak levels ofactivity achieved during eight years of economic expansion.Most small businesses would probably be happy to freezetoday's performance if they could be guaranteed it for thenext five years. They'd rather do that than take theirchances with an uncertain economy.   Things look bad only because we've had a decade ofextraordinary growth under the Reagan Administration. What weare experiencing is a period of slower growth, not a downturnof cataclysmic proportions.                                                                                                          Q. Still, given the Iraq crisis and its impact on oilprices, the cost of the savings and loan bailout andcontinued economic weakness, small businesses can't bebreathing easy.   A. Historically, war has always provided a stimulus foreconomic growth. War means heavy government spending, morejobs, higher incomes . . . and small business benefitsgreatly in this scenario.   The major threat the Sandamp;L crisis poses to small business isthat interest rates will continue to stay high. Fortunately,many small businesses have no debt or don't rely heavily onfrequent borrowing.   {Only 11% of business owners queried in the latest NFIBsurvey said financing was harder to arrange than earlier inthe year. Only 12% -- up from 9% in the previous quarter --said they expected borrowing to be more difficult in thecoming months.}   What is most worrisome for small businesses is thecontinuing weakness in the economy. That translates intofewer customers through the door, lower cash flow and areduction in employment. But a war and the increased spendingthat accompanies it should more than counteract theweaknesses in the economy.                                                                                                          Q. Do small businesses share your vision?   A. Small-business optimism is the lowest it's been since1982. We're back at pre-expansion levels. But the bottomhasn't dropped out of the outlook as it did in 1979.   In sharp contrast to 1979, small businesses still haveplans to hire. They have no excessive inventory. Mostimportant, they have been managing their firms in theexpectation of a repeat of the recession they faced between1980 and 1982.   {In the NFIB's latest quarterly economic survey, 22% ofthose queried said they expected business to worsen, comparedwith 14% in the previous quarter.}                                                                                                          Q. How will small business fare over the next five years?   A. The prospects for small firms are excellent. First, theoutlook for the economy is good. Within that framework, thesuccessful firm of the future has to be flexible, moreniche-oriented, able to change quickly to changes in demandand in technology. All these -- characteristics of smallbusinesses -- favor the smaller size firm.                                                                                                          Q. You feel that small businesses will do better than theeconomy as a whole?   A. I don't think so. One reason is that legislators mayforce smaller firms to carry a larger share of the costs ofthe social programs in the '90s. Such programs as parentalleave, disability, environment and health care will becomecostlier and small businesses will be asked to increase theircontribution. The difficulty of attracting qualified labor --and the costs of training -- will also raise costs for smallfirms. Nonetheless, small businesses will contribute agreater portion of the new job growth in the next decade.                                                                                                          Q. Will some small businesses benefit more than others?   A. That's really a guessing game, isn't it? Still, thereare some fundamental factors that help identify those morelikely to succeed.   Service businesses, which are dominated by small firms,will continue to demonstrate strong growth, especially inareas of information processing and services. Manufacturingalso will become attractive because of its high-techcomponent and its need for adaptability.                                                                                                          Q. Who's likely to be hurt the most?   A. Specialized retailers in urban areas. The deteriorationof urban markets means a shrinking customer base and fewercustomers. Small construction firms also face seriousproblems for the next five years. We've tremendouslyoverbuilt and the demographics are turning negative forfurther expansion: We have a seven-year supply of officespace, three-year supply of multi-family housing units and anoverabundance of traditional family homes for a decade.   A rise in oil prices obviously will affect suchfuel-intensive businesses as transportation. But if businessdemand stays strong, they can pass it on to the customer.</TEXT></DOC>
