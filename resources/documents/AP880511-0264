The 252-172 decision in the Democratic-controlled chamber wentlargely along party lines.   The bill will eventually be sent to a conference committee to bereconciled with the different Pentagon budget measure now on theSenate floor.   The Senate, meanwhile, voted Wednesday for a $4.55 billion StarWars budget, narrowly rejecting a move to cut deeply into Reagan'scherished anti-missile research program.   The House bill authorizes the Pentagon to spend $299.5 billionin the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, the same total as the Senateplan and the amount Reagan approved last December in an agreementwith congressional leaders aimed at reducing federal budgetdeficits. The current budget is about $299 billion.   But the House added a ban on any Star Wars tests that violatethe so-called ``narrow'' interpretation of the 1972 Anti-BallisticMissile treaty, and also voted against buying any nuclear weaponsthat violate the numerical limits in the unratified 1979 SALT IInuclear arms treaty.   The Senate, by a 51-45 margin, voted Wednesday afternoon to killa provision in that chamber's bill that would also ban weaponsbeyond the SALT II limits.   The House also added a directive telling Reagan to order themilitary into the fight against illegal drug smuggling. The Senateis likely to consider a similar proposal.   Reagan opposes both arms restrictions and is also unhappy withthe $3.5 billion approved by the House for the Strategic DefenseInitiative, as Star Wars is formally known.   Reagan had wanted $4.8 billion for Star Wars next year, comparedwith the current SDI budget of $3.9 billion.   In a letter to the House, Reagan said he was ``deeplydisappointed'' by the chamber's actions and said the restrictions``would seriously undermine our position in negotiations with theSoviet Union and (would) hold back the progress of the StrategicDefense Initiative.''   Reagan said he wants progress in nuclear arms control, butadded, ``We cannot do it alone. It is time for the House to step upto these responsibilities and pass a defense authorization billthat will strengthen our security.''   But Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, said, ``I don't believe the president has any reason tobe upset. I think it's a good bill. We gave the president a lot ofwhat he wanted.''   Hours before the final House vote, the Senate voted 50-48against a deep reduction in Star Wars.   The Senate defeated a proposal by Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La.,to reduce the SDI budget to about $3.8 billion and devote the extra$750 million to the space shuttle and a space station.   Johnston's loss was similar to his defeats in each of the pasttwo years, when he failed by a single vote to slash the SDI budget.Last year, Vice President George Bush cast the tie-breaking vote inhis role as the Senate's presiding officer.   Congress has consistently scaled back Reagan's annual requestsfor sharp increases in spending for the 5-year-old program SDIprogram.   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has said he would recommenda Reagan veto of the entire Pentagon budget bill unless Congressvotes enough money for Star Wars.   Johnston argued that ``it's going to be very, very difficult toget that space station going unless we give it some more money. ...What's the higher priority here, the space station and the shuttleor SDI? The space station has a lot of defense implications. ...Dollars are scarce.''   But Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said Johnston's proposal ``would bevery detrimental to the defense budget.''   Originally, Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., simply proposedreducing the proposed SDI budget from $4.6 billion to $3.9 billion,but that lost on a 66-29 vote.   While the House measure restricts Reagan's arms control policiesand Star Wars, it granted Reagan's request for spending for a vastvariety of weapons.   That total includes 180 F-16 jet fighter planes, 84 F-A-18 jets,42 F-15 jets, a dozen F-14 jets, three new Navy destroyers, twomore attack submarines, one Trident missile-firing sub, the firstof the new ``Seawolf'' class subs and 611 M-1 tanks.</TEXT></DOC>
