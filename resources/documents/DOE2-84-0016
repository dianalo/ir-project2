With heating systems,in which the annual heat consumption is supplied by a heat pump and asupplementary boiler, the appropriate coverage is determined by splittingthe areas beneath the mean annual line, i.e. the frequency of the externaltemperatures arising at the installation site. In this regard, the effectof the external temperature dependent curve obtained from the gain inroom heat, which was previously disregarded when determining the coverage,is investigated.</TEXT></DOC>
