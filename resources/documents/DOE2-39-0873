They deal with the 'approaches'which are called 'exemplary' in the decisions. They do not discuss theirbasic postulates saying it is, in the interest of an ecologically andeconomically reasonable energy policy, necessary to do without nulcearenergy and with the alternatives available, this could be done also withoutstepping from nuclear energy into other dependencies. The author regardsboth of these postulates as wrong; he explains this elsewhere and namesalso his reasons. The article's objective is to give some hints as tohow useful the individual approaches are.</TEXT></DOC>
