FifthGeneration Systems offers a $245 solution that will work on any LAN.andP;  DirectNet (DNet for short) offers a network tracking system that will organize allthe software on your network and let users navigate through it.andP;  It alsohelps you select and view application usage in only one keystroke.andM;Fifth Generation Systems designed its network menuing utility to simplify themanagement of LANS.andP;  Through menudriven programs, DNet lets you create astandard menu for each user group.andP;  You can tailor it to fit each user'sspecific needs and distribute it to the appropriate place on the network.andO;This way, you don't have to waste your time budding a menu from scratch forindividual workstations.andP;  DNet even has a screen-save utility to helpeliminate potential monitor problems for users with older displays.andM;REQUIREMENTS FOR SETUPandM;The DNet package contains an easy-to-follow supervisor manual, three userguides, and the necessary software.andP;  You install the software on the fileserver's hard drive and run it in each workstation.andP;  You can start theprogram directly from DOS or use a log-in batch file.andP;  DNet does not gomemory resident.andP;  It runs in any PC with 256K RAM, but you need 512K RAM forthe initial setup.andM;Installation takes only minutes; menus, however, require more time to create.andO;Entering data and designing menus can be time-consuming, and if you're asupervisor, you must also dispense user or workstation IDs and applicationlists.andP;  You can create passwords for the system, then add another layer ofpasswords over them.andP;  DNet's levels of passwords make for a tight securitysystem.andP;  One particular feature restricts access to DOS, but it's onlypartially successful since some applications that require access to the DOScommand line manage to get through anyway.andM;We found when setting up menus that it's best to choose words describing theapplication rather than including the user name.andP;  DNet uses the term username to refer to another level of identification.andP;  DNet user menus cancontain up to 20 selections, chosen by typing letters of the alphabet from Ato T. Each selection in the main menu can lead to one level of submenus-alimitation that on some networks restricts your ability to create severaltiers of menus.andP;  The main menu selections require only 1K RAM; the submenuscall for a larger 27K RAM.andM;USAGE TRACKINGandM;A central maintenance menu helps you track activities to a log file andupdate individual menus; you can track users, projects, workstations, andapplications all from this menu.andP;  Referring to the log helps you stay on topof system usage.andP;  DNet prompts users for their names and project numbers whenthey attempt to access applications; this aids in tracking user and usage.andO;For the usage report, you can select a primary and secondary sort from amongfive sort options.andP;  DNet gives you a choice between detailed and summaryreports that you can review on-screen or output to the printer.andM;In designing such a simple-to-use program, Fifth Gereration Systems hascreated a network management tool convenient to LAN users and supervisorsalike.andP;  For the LAN supervisor, Direct Net produces versatile usage reportsthat help indicate which applications individual users run most.andM;Direct Not, Version 1.0 FM Generation Systems, 10049 N.
