A half-dozen merger announcements in recent weeks have helped revive the sector, with most of the transactions at modest premiums to book value, typically about 20% above book. That can mean sizable gains for holders.    Massachusetts thrifts, which traded at an average of 68% of book value a month ago, have risen to 78% of book value, according to Advest Group Inc. In the same period, the ratio for all New England thrift stocks rose to 72% from 65%.    Many analysts and money managers see further growth, though they don't anticipate a return to the heady period leading up to last March, when the average Massachusetts thrift was trading at 129% of book value.    Tracey Stangle, who tracks thrifts for Hartford, Conn.-based Coburn andamp; Meredith Inc., notes that while New England thrift stocks performed worse than thrifts nationwide for much of last year, they have done substantially better than other thrifts in recent weeks.    James Moynihan, a senior vice president at Advest, contends that with New England's economy still buoyant and the region's thrifts &quot;pretty solid&quot; financially, the group was oversold last fall.    In light of last year's setbacks, investors will &quot;buy below book value, but once (stocks) get above book value, they will be more careful,&quot; says James Schmidt, portfolio manager for Boston-based Tucker Anthony Freedom Financial Services Fund. Mr. Schmidt says he has been buying thrifts on a combination of factors, including earnings, market-to-book ratio and whether an institution &quot;would make sense as an acquisition candidate.&quot;    Among Mr. Schmidt's current favorites are Manchester, N.H.-based United Savers Bancorp and Boston-based Eliot Savings Bank, each of which has been trading at little over half of book value. United Savers last September called off a planned &quot;merger of equals&quot; with Peoples Heritage Savings Bank of Portland, Maine. United Savers could still be among the first New Hampshire banks to combine with an out-of-state bank under the state's new regional banking legislation, says Mr. Schmidt. The stock has been trading at around 14, down from a 52-week high of 30. It closed yesterday at 13 3/4, down 1/4.    Mr. Schmidt says he doesn't see Eliot as a likely takeover candidate, but believes the stock, which closed yesterday at 8 3/4, off 1/2, is &quot;worth more on its fundamentals&quot; -- partly because new management brought in from outside the bank has largely revamped its asset base.    Mr. Moynihan points to several &quot;quality&quot; thrifts that could be caught up in a new wave of mergers: Home Owners Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association and Boston Five Cents Savings Bank, both in Boston; Portland, Maine-based One Bancorp; Manchester, N.H.-based Amoskeag Bank Shares Inc.; and Providence, R.I.-based Citizens Financial Group Inc.    Another acquisition candidate, according to Mr. Moynihan, is Suffield, Conn.-based Suffield Financial Corp., whose former chairman resigned last July after the Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating him for possible insider trading violations in connection with Suffield's 1986 acquisition of Portland, Maine-based Coastal Bancorp.    Regulators have been investigating other possible illegal trading in New England thrifts. Many savings banks converted from mutual to stock ownership in the mid-1980s, and used some of their new capital to invest in stocks -- often the stocks of other thrifts. Some scored large gains while the stocks were performing well, but have seen much of that erode since last spring.    Amoskeag, for example, recently announced it expects to report a net loss of about $16 million for the 1987 fourth quarter, because of losses on stock sales and the write-down of remaining equities to market price. The company's 1987 &quot;core earnings&quot; -- exclusive of securities investments -- are expected to rise almost 20%.    One acquisition candidate in which most of the play may already be gone is the region's largest thrift, Hartford, Conn.-based Northeast Savings, which announced Monday its directors are considering selling the company. Northeast has been trying to thwart a move by Massachusetts investor Abraham Gosman to increase his family's 9.8% stake in Northeast to as much as 35%. Monday's announcement came after the expiration last Friday of a standstill accord under which Mr. Gosman and his affiliates had agreed not to buy more Northeast securities.    Northeast's share price climbed 39% to 18 7/8 last week before the company's announcement. Analysts say the rise may have been due partly to expectations that the company would seek a white knight to foil Mr. Gosman. Northeast shares climbed as high as 21 1/2 Monday, but have since fallen back. The stock closed yesterday at 18 3/4, down 1.    The company, which says it would prefer to arrange an offer for all shares at a uniform price than to see Mr. Gosman gradually accumulate a controlling interest, won't disclose possible buyers. But analysts say sizable goodwill on Northeast's books is likely to discourage most potential buyers. Northeast, originally a New York State-based institution, moved into Connecticut and Massachusetts by acquiring troubled thrifts in those states. </TEXT></DOC>
