Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are approximately 10 handlers and 20 producers of South Texas lettucecovered under this marketing order. Small agricultural producers have beendefined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.2) as those havingannual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firmsare defined at those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. Themajority of the handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.The budget of expenses for the 1989-90 fiscal year was prepared by theSouth Texas Lettuce Committee (committee), the agency responsible for localadministration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Departmentof Agriculture for approval. The members of the committee are handlersand producers of lettuce. They are familiar with the committee's needsand with the costs for goods, services and personnel in their local areaand are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budgetwas formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affectedpersons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input.The assessment rate recommended by the committee was derived by dividinganticipated expenses by expected shipments of lettuce. Because that rateis applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate whichwill produce sufficient income to pay the committee's expected expenses.The committee met on October 3, 1989, and unanimously recommended a 1989-90budget of $51,531.49. Last season's budget was $34,305. Major expense itemsinclude increases in committee staff salaries, travel and marketing developmentand production research projects.The committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.05per carton, the same rate as last season's. This rate, when applied toanticipated shipments of 1,011,500 cartons of lettuce, would yield $50,575in assessment revenue. This amount when added to $956.49 from the reservefund would be adequate to cover budgeted expenses.While this action imposes some additional costs on handlers, the costsare in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additionalcosts may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offsetby the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore,the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.A proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 31, 1989 (54 FR 45737). That documentcontained a proposal to add andSection; 971.229 to authorize expenses andestablish an assessment rate for the committee. That rule provided thatinterested persons could file comments through November 10, 1989. No commentswere received.It is found that the specified expenses are reasonable and likely to beincurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to coversuch expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.This action should be expedited because the committee needs to have sufficientfunds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The1989-90 fiscal period began in August, and the marketing order requiresthat the rate of assessment apply to all assessable lettuce handled duringthe fiscal period. In addition, handlers are aware of this action whichwas recommended by the committee at a public meeting. Therefore, it isalso found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective dateof this action until 30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (5 U.S.C. 553).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 971</ITAG>Lettuce, Marketing agreements and orders, South Texas.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 971 is amended asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 971_LETTUCE GROWN IN LOWER RIO GRANDE VALLEY IN SOUTH TEXAS</ITAG>1.
