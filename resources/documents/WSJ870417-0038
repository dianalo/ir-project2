According to the source, the Philippines soon will inform the banks that it will pay an interest margin of only 13/16 percentage point above the banks' cost of funds on the $10.2 billion of recently rescheduled medium-term and long-term bank debt.    That is lower than the seven-eighths of a point that the Philippines and major banks agreed to in talks last month. The difference between the two margins would save the Philippines slightly more than $5 million a year in interest payments. The cost of funds is the London interbank offered rate, which banks pay for funds in the London market.    The Philippines is expected to make the move because Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin is said to be angry at this week's $30 billion debt pact between Argentina and its main creditor banks.    That proposed pact, which has to be ratified by Argentina's creditor banks, would give Argentina an interest margin of 13/16 point above Libor on $24 billion of its $35 billion of bank debt. Mr. Ongpin has said he was denied this lower interest margin and was told by the banks that no other big debtor countries would receive such a margin after it was granted Mexico last year.    Mr. Ongpin foreshadowed the possibility of Philippine action on Wednesday when he told a news conference in Manila that, because of the proposed Argentine accord, the Philippines reserved the right to open any aspect of its debt agreement with the banks.    A spokesman for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. declined to comment on the impending Philippines move. The bank, a unit of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., chairs the committee of the Philippines' major creditor banks. </TEXT></DOC>
