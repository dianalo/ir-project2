As many as15,000 of his comrades died in the war he fought there againstMoslem guerrillas; 35,000 others were wounded.   Dispatched to Afghanistan in December 1979 ostensibly at therequest of the pro-Moscow government, Ivan leaves now with thestability of the Marxist regime apparently as menaced as ever. Andhis government learned the lesson that Vietnam taught the UnitedStates 15 years ago: Even a superpower can't win someone else's war.   As a convoy of more than 100 Soviet tanks and trucks set out forthe border Feb. 9, President Najib of Afghanistan assured reportersthat ``state power is in full control of the situation,'' but as hespoke to reporters in Kabul, his capial, explosions and artilleryfire echoed throughout the city.   Some 120,000 strong, the Soviets battled the Afghan resistancefor more than twice as long as it took their fathers to drive Naziinvaders back from Stalingrad, Leningrad and Moscow and all the wayto Berlin in World War II.   But as the Red Army pulled out of Afghanistan, the mujahedeenrebels were able to block regular shipments of flour and keroseneeven to the 2 million inhabitants of Kabul. Other cities, includingGardez and Khost, were also besieged, the Soviets reported.   Like Vietnam for the Americans, Afghanistan confounded theKremlin's best and brightest. Their cause, they said, was buildingsocialism in a poor, mountainous land that even Afghan Marxists sayis ``99 percent Moslem'' and where every invader through history hasmet ferocious resistance.   ``We obviously overestimated our possibilities and underestimatedwhat one might call `the resistance of the medium','' said oneSoviet commentator, Alexander Bovin. ``And in Afghanistan, we paidthe highest price of all _ the price of blood.''   ``An incorrect prediction was made,'' author Alexander Prokhanovwrote last year. ``Experts were wrong in their assessment of thesituation in the country. Mistakes were made by specialists inIslam, diplomats, politicians, the military. Because, I repeat, themain aims were not achieved.''   Leonid I. Brezhnev, the the Soviet president, said he orderedtanks and troops to cross the 1,300-mile border with the SovietUnion's Texas-size neighbor Dec. 24-27, 1979, to counter what hedescribed as Western efforts to create a foyer of Islamicfundamentalism at the Soviet doorstep.   For the Kremlin to have done nothing, Brezhnev said soon afterthe intervention, would have been ``to watch passively the formationon our southern border of a serious danger to the security of theSoviet state.''   The decision to intervene was opposed by some in Moscow.   Oleg Bogomolov, now an economic adviser to President Mikhail S.Gorbachev, disclosed last year that the think tank he heads, theInstitute of Economics of the World Socialist System, sent a messageto the Kremlin within weeks of the intervention opposing it as``futile and damaging.''   The memo, Bogomolov recalled, said the invasion blocked detentewith the United States, eliminated chances for limiting the armsrace and sapped Kremlin influence in Moslem countries and the ThirdWorld.   Indeed, the Western world reacted with outrage. And the shockwaves rippled far from Afghanistan, prompting the United States tosuspend grain sales and the export of high-technology electronicgear coveted by a Soviet society left far behind by the informationexplosion. Sixty-four nations joined a boycott of the 1980 SummerOlympics in Moscow, and the Kremlin, stung by criticism of itsactions, banished human rights activist Andrei D. Sahkarov tointernal exile after he protested the invasion.   President Jimmy Carter called the Soviet drive into Afghanistan``the most serious threat to peace since the Second World War''because it brought the other superpower within easy strikingdistance of the oil-rich Persian Gulf, which Carter proclaimed vitalto U.S. security.   Even top members of the Kremlin hierarchy were caught by surprise.   ``There are even candidate members of the Politburo who learnedthat troops had entered Afghanistan only after reading thenewspapers,'' editor Grigory Baklanov said in a speech last year.   What may have beguiled the Soviets was the apparent similarity ofAfghanistan to their own heavily Moslem Central Asian republics,where Bolshevik rule was imposed in the 1920s by Communistcommissars leading Red Army troops against local tribal bands.   Portrayed by the Soviet press as liberators, Red Army troops wentto help their Afghan comrades build a Marxist-Leninist society, orso the official thinking went.   But in Afghanistan, Prokhanov said, ``sobering events dispelledmany illusions. ... Crowds of many thousands, carrying the greenMoslem banner and shouting `Allah Akhbar,' stormed the (party)district committees.''   He blamed Najib's party, the People's Democratic Party ofAfghanistan, both for doctrinaire measures _ ``the persecution ofmullahs and the flouting of customs'' _ and for abandoning the goalsof the country's 1978 Marxist revolution.   ``Since those December days when the U.S.S.R.'s troops went intoAfghanistan, the Kabul government's political course has changedmany times,'' Prokhanov said. ``The original aims proclaimed by thePDPA were not achieved. They have been renounced by the partyitself. ... And that being so, the presence of Soviet troops in thecountry loses its meaning. Departure is inevitable, logical.''   In a 1986 speech, Gorbachev placed the blame for the continuingstrife in Afghanistan on the West, but he voiced the Soviets'growing desire to get out.   ``Counterrevolution and imperialism,'' he said, ``have turnedAfghanistan into a bleeding wound.''   Although the horrors of the Afghan war, unlike Vietnam, werenever brought regularly into Soviets' living rooms on television,the loosened restraints on expression inspired by Gorbachev's drivefor ``glasnost,'' or openness, increasingly emboldened Soviets tovoice objections to the war.   A documentary film titled ``The Return,'' which made its way intotheaters last year, showed wounded Soviet soldiers and blown-uptanks for the first time. It also showed troubled veterans and abereaved mother.   ``I'm a terrible enemy of this war,'' said a tearful KlavdiaIlyin, with a picture of her fallen son on a shelf in thebackground. ``I don't see why our children are there.''   In February 1988, Gorbachev said the Soviets were pulling outwhether or not Najib's efforts at ``national reconciliation'' weresuccessful. In effect, the Soviets abandoned any claim they had on``safeguarding'' the gains of socialism in Afghanistan.   Like the British cavalry whose noble but futile charge in theCrimean War is honored in Tennyson's poem ``The Charge of the LightBrigade,'' Ivan the soldier is now praised for his valor in a noblecause _ but not for victory.   ``Planes carrying soldiers are flying out of Afghanistan,''Pravda wrote the other day. ``Military columns are starting out onthe road, or are just about to. For home. For the motherland.Soldiers are coming back from the war, having done their duty.''   Despite such ritualist talk of duty, a stanza from a song ofSoviet soldiers in Afghanistan shows the bewilderment and futilitymany felt:   ``They fight for the Prophet Mohammed,   ``While we defend only our Soviet truck.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Release Anytime</NOTE></DOC>
