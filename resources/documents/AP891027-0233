That's one view.   Another is that American farmers and consumers are on a windingpath through dark forests and threatening chasms where wickednessand mysterious forces lurk, ready to pounce and gobble up themighty U.S. food machine.   Meanwhile, there are all shades of support and criticism aboutthe government's proposal to revamp global agricultural trade. Theproposal, finely tuned over the last three months, was presentedlast week to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva.   Since World War II, the 97-nation GATT has been the principalregulatory body for international trade. The eighth round ofnegotiations _ which are held periodically to update the rules _began in Punta del Este, Uruguay, on Sept. 20, 1986, and willcontinue through 1990.   A major U.S. drive in the Uruguay Round was to put agriculturaltrade up front during the negotiations. The United States hascalled for cutbacks or the elimination of ``trade distorting''programs and policies.   One feature of the plan submitted to GATT calls for theelimination of commodity export subsidies within five years. Someother programs would be phased out over 10 years, while otherswould be retained _ as long as they do not distort world trade.   The plan is aimed at trade liberalization so that U.S. crops,meat, poultry and dairy products have the fullest possible accessto foreign markets. Therein, advocates say, lie the future richesof U.S. agriculture.   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., as chairman of the Senate AgricultureCommittee, supports the idea of eliminating export subsidies,indicating their elimination ``should be the top priority'' of GATTnegotiations.   But Leahy cautioned that ``a bad GATT deal is worse than no dealat all. It must be crystal clear _ agriculture cannot be traded offfor gains in intellectual property, trade in services or any otherarea of these negotiations.''   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, who was joined byAgriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter last week in announcing theproposal, said the GATT talks are entering ``the most creativephase of the Uruguay Round'' of negotiations.   The agricultural proposal and one on trade and servicessubmitted to GATT earlier in the week represent ``a microcosm ofour broad goal ... to eliminate the hundreds of ways thatgovernments distort trade and restrict fair competition,'' Hillssaid. ``We seek to achieve this goal through fundamental reform inthe global trading system.''   What do all these have to do with American farmers?   Yeutter, a former University of Nebraska economics professor aswell as a farmer, cited one study that indicated the cost of tradedistortions in agriculture alone in developed nations is about $165billion a year.   Yeutter said that for every dollar of financial assistance tofarmers in developed countries, about $1.40 is spent by consumers,taxpayers or a combination of the two.   ``In other words, there is about a 40 percent slippage, and ifwe can, through negotiations, correct that 40 percent slippagefactor, we can theoretically increase farm incomes or comparablyincrease benefits to consumers and taxpayers by that amount,'' hesaid.   If it were all passed on to farmers, Yeutter said, ``one shouldbe able, on paper, at least, to increase farm incomes in thedeveloped world by as much as 40 percent.''   By that reckoning, he said, this year's farm income estimated at$50 billion would go up by an additional $20 billion.   Leland Swenson, president of the National Farmers Union, isamong those who aren't convinced that scrapping subsidies right andleft, opening trade doors and demolishing barriers is a realisticgoal.   One problem that Swenson and others have with the trade proposalis that it would seek the 10-year elimination of ``income supportpolicies linked to production or marketing.'' The proposal wouldallow ``income support policies not linked to production ormarketing.''   According to the proposal, only ``direct income payments toproducers that are not tied to current production, prices, the costof production or marketings of agricultural commodities'' would bepermitted after the 10-year phase-out.   Swenson, in a telephone interview, said his group is adamantlyopposed to the elimination of price support programs that are tiedto production. ``That's our domestic farm program,'' he said.   But the Farmers Union would go along with the elimination ofdirect export subsidies _ including the Export Enhancement Programused by the United States to meet foreign competition _ if othercountries do the same.   Yeutter was asked about the opposition of some farmorganizations to the U.S. proposals at GATT and that ``there hasbeen talk that you are really trying to eliminate the U.S.agricultural program altogether.''   ``As I indicated earlier, we are not going to eliminate anythingunless our trading partners are prepared to take comparableactions,'' he replied. ``That is a matter for the negotiatingtable.''   Yeutter also repeated his assertion that the proposal is in thebest interest of American farmers and ``will clearly and verysubstantially increase farm incomes'' in the United States.   ``If there are some farm organizations that would prefer lowerfarm income to higher farm incomes, then they can defend thatposition to their membership,'' he said. ``I prefer high farmincomes to lower incomes, and I will articulate that cause in avery active way.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 29</NOTE></DOC>
