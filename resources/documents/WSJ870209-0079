The Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act was passed in 1978 when the Carter administration convinced Congress -- and much of the American public -- that the U.S. was running out of oil and natural gas. That view held that the only way out of the clutches of OPEC was to retrench, and coal was seen as America's only remaining fuel source still in guaranteed abundance. What the Carter team forgot was that there is no such thing as a shortage, there is only a price.    On the first day of the 100th Congress, legislation was introduced to repeal the Fuel Use Act, which prohibits the use of oil or natural gas in most new industrial boilers and nearly all new electricity power plants. The repeal effort is being led by J. Bennett Johnston (D., La.), the new chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Senate action on the bill is expected within a month, but the debate is likely to be fierce given the opposition of the coal industry, the United Mine Workers and coal-hauling railways.    This pro-coal coalition managed to defeat a similar effort in the waning days of the last session of Congress. The House had passed an amendment to a continuing resolution on defense spending that would have repealed the Fuel Use Act. But Sen. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), then the Democrats' minority leader in the Senate, heard complaints about the measure from the miners' union and his home state's coal companies. He got the amendment killed.    Among the groups advocating repeal are the American Gas Association, representing pipelines and end-users; the Natural Gas Supply Association; the Interstate Natural Gas Association; the American Petroleum Institute; the Edison Electric Institute, representing private utilities, and the American Public Power Association.    There has never been such widespread agreement among these diverse groups since federal controls were first placed on natural gas in 1938 and on oil in 1969. But oil-price decontrol, completed by President Reagan six years ago, and partial natural-gas deregulation over the past few years has taught these lobbies that a free market works to the advantage of producers, transporters and consumers alike.    Even partial decontrol of natural gas has already reaped huge benefits. During the days of tightest controls in the 1970s, additions to natural-gas reserves from new exploration in the lower 48 states were replacing only 46% of annual consumption. As a result of the partial deregulation of the 1980s, reserve additions now average close to full replacement. Complete decontrol would yield important price benefits.    The industry is now suffering from a so-called &quot;gas bubble,&quot; too much supply and too little demand. Which means that repeal of the Fuel Use Act would make more efficient use of gas-industry resources. Technological advances in jet engines are now being applied to electricity production using natural-gas fuel, for example, and the addition of natural gas to the burn cycle of old coal-fired plans can improve efficiency and reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions.    The repeal of the Fuel Use Act could also serve to resolve the nettlesome dispute between natural-gas producers and pipelines over expensive &quot;take-or-pay&quot; contracts signed when almost everyone believed the U.S. was running short of energy. The American Gas Association estimates that repeal of the act would increase gas demand by 5% to 10% in the early 1990s and by 15% to 20% by the year 2000. Increased demand would help producers and more throughput would help offset the pipelines' fixed overhead costs. Both sides might then decide to tear up their old contracts and start anew in a deregulated market to gain new consumers.    The Fuel Use Act is a product of wrongheaded thinking about energy economics. It's time for Washington to cap the success of oil decontrol with a similar treatment of natural gas. </TEXT></DOC>
