During coordinated raids across the country, police confiscatedknives, guns, ammunition, posters of Adolf Hitler andswastika-covered banners from members of the Nationale Sammlung.   ``The Federal Republic is not about to become the roaming groundsfor right-wing extremists,'' Interior Minister Friedrich Zimmermannsaid in announcing the ban.   The group's leader, neo-Nazi Michael Kuehnen, said he wasconsidering legal action to fight the ban.   Founded last summer, the Nationale Sammlung had fieldedcandidates for next month's elections in Frankfurt and suburbanLangen and said it hoped to run in other locations as well. Itsplatform included renaming a railway station after Hitler.   The ban forbids Nationale Sammlung members from carrying out anyactivities as a group, including fielding candidates for anelection, and it bans them from using the name publicly.   It coincides with a growing concern in West Germany of a possibleresurgence of ultra-rightist tendencies.   Late Thursday, the ZDF television network quoted GuentherSchleicher, head of the Hesse state Office for the Protection of theConstitution, as alleging that cases of murder and bank robberieshave been linked to neo-Nazi parties in West Germany.   Schleicher also estimated about 2,000 neo-Nazis are in WestGermany, although other officials have put the figure closer to1,500.   ``Germany, they're coming,'' Stern magazine said in a headline onthis week's cover. Another headline sarcastically referred to theextremists as ``the nice Nazis from next door.''   A poll published Sunday by the Welt am Sonntag newspaper saidanother extreme right-wing group, the Republican Party, would win11.5 percent of the vote nationwide if federal elections were heldnow.   The Republicans, headed by a former Nazi Waffen SS soldier,captured 7.5 percent of the vote in last month's elections in WestBerlin. That sends 11 party members to the local legislature andgives the Republicans two seats in Parliament beginning next year.   Further to the right of the Republican Party are the neo-Nazis,who are split into about 10 different groups. The most notorious isNationale Sammlung, which has about 170 members.   The interior ministry said Nationale Sammlung had expressedrevolutionary and combative aims to change West German society. Italso accused Kuehnen and his followers of building up neo-Nazigroups nationwide.   The organization supports expulsion from West Germany of foreignworkers and asylum seekers.   Kuehnen has also been active with right-wing extremists fromseveral countries in planning celebrations for the 100th anniversaryof Hitler's birth April 20.   Contacted in Munich, Kuenhen said in an interview he would fightthe ban in court. ``I see certain legal possibilities,'' saidKuehnen, who has served three prison terms for Nazi activities.   West Germany's ARD TV network showed police carrying knives, gunsand a box filled with ammunition from Kuehnen's Frankfurt home,which serves as the party's headquarters. Kuehnen was not homeduring the raid.   The broadcast showed police in a workshop of the house, whereKuehnen and his supporters allegedly filed down bullets so theywould cause more severe injuries.   Gottfried Milde, the interior minister of the state of Hesse,said most of the raids were in Hesse, which includes Frankfurt.   The other states where police staged raids included Bavaria andNorth Rhine-Westphalia, the federal interior ministry said.   Searches there turned up an air rifle, two steel helmets, a gasmask, three pistols for firing blanks, and Nazi propaganda.   Zimmermann said authorities were seizing any property they couldfind that belonged to the NS group, whose initials are identical tothe best-known German abbreviation for Hitler's Nazi Party.   The Nazi Party has been banned since West Germany was founded in1949.   Under West German law, the Interior Ministry may ban anyorganization it determines is spreading Nazi propaganda. Violationsof the ban carry penalties of up to five years in prison.   There have been calls for the ministry to ban another neo-Nazigroup, the Free German Workers' Party, which the interior ministrysays has about 500 members. The party is under investigation inconnection with arson attacks on foreign workers in West Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
