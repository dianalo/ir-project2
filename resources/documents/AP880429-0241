(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists from around the globe gatheredFriday to plan for International Space Year in 1992 and were calledthe spiritual descendants of Christopher Columbus.   ``You are explorers who know of enduring hardship ... to triumphover great natural obstacles,'' said Harvey Meyerson, president ofthe U.S.-ISY Association, which is supervising the planning.   The organization is orchestrating a series of space projects tocommemorate the 500th anniversary of Columbus' first voyage to theNew World in 1492.   ``This effort unites the universal themes ... that have poweredthe human spirit in the past and continue to point to a future ofunlimited horizons,'' added James C. Fletcher, the chief of theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration.   Nearly 90 scientists from 17 space agencies, including those ofthe Soviet Union, China and Western European, opened the three-daymeeting at the University of New Hampshire.   The scientists are planning projects that will use spacesatellites to research global problems including acid rain, ozonedepletion and the apparent gradual warming of the Earth's climate,known as the greenhouse effect.   Images of the planet from space, Fletcher said, have ``triggeredan awareness of Earth as a fragile and most precious life supportsystem, one made even more precious because ... it is the only bodyin our solar system to harbor and nourish life.''   The space year will include TV specials, expositions and tradefairs. The events will help persuade people and governments thatspace technology is worth its high cost, said Philip Goldsmith ofthe European Space Agency, a consortium of several western Europeannations.   ``It's easy to convince the public and political masters of theglamor projects like space travel ... but harder to maintain theenthusiasm and funding levels for the long period needed to observeEarth,'' Goldsmith said.</TEXT></DOC>
