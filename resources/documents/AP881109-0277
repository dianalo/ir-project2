The virus is more a nusiance than a threat, said Michael Walters,director of research and instructional computing services.   ``It probably hasn't cost us much except a few days ofpeople-time to clean up these disks, but it probably cost thestudents a good bit of frustration,'' Walter said last week.   A computer virus is a string of coded commands hidden inprograms. Like a biological virus, it uses its host to reproduce,replicating itself into other programs used on the same computer orinto computers to which it is connected.   The affected university computers were isolated, and the virus'spread was limited, Walters said.   Last week, a sophisticated virus spread throughout a computernetwork used by universities and defense contractors and eventuallyaffected an estimated 6,000 computers nationwide.   The Texas virus appeared to be a version of the so-called``Brain'' computer virus that was traced to a computer store inLahore, Pakistan.</TEXT></DOC>
