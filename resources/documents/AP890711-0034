Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin told the legislature, orSupreme Soviet, on Monday that his department, which runs thenational police, doesn't have the resources to stop crime.   He said the economic problems and moral decay that are unwantedbyproducts of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program hadcontributed to a 39.9 percent rise in serious crime when compared tothe first half of 1988.   Adolescent crime has risen 22 percent so far this year andunreported crime is growing at three or four times the rate ofrecorded crime, he said.   ``Unbalanced development in the economy, politics, social andmoral spheres is inevitable in the transition period,'' Bakatinsaid. This ``in turn provokes tension, shortages, social injusticeand stimulates crime.''   The United States spends $100 per capita on police, whereas inthe Soviet Union, the figure is $12, he told the lawmakers.   Bakatin spoke shortly before the 542-member Supreme Soviet votedto retain him as interior minister, a post he has held since October.   He was subject to confirmation along with nearly 60 otherofficials appearing before the new legislature, which has rejectedseveral candidates for the Supreme Court and Cabinet.   Many Soviets are afraid to walk the streets at night because ofan increase in murders, muggings and rape. Shortages that haveworsened steadily under economic reforms have created a demand forstolen goods that spurs on robbers.   Gorbachev has acknowledged that the restructuring he initiatedsince coming to power four years ago could lead to more crime.   At the confirmation hearing, Gorbachev said he had been impressedby the number of police he saw during a June 12-16 visit to WestGermany.   He said he was told there is one policeman for every 400 Germans.Bakatin said that in the Soviet Union there is one for every 588citizens.   The Soviet Union once kept crime statistics secret, claimingsocialism was free of crime rampant in the West.   ``A theory was cultivated for many decades that crime here wasconsidered officially a rudiment of social antagonism fromexploiting societies which should die as socialism developed,''Bakatin said. ``But it didn't.''   Meanwhile, another government candidate up for legislativeapproval, Health Minister Yevgeny I. Chazov, told legislators thehealth system is in the ``most severe crisis.''   Chazov, who was confirmed, said about 63 percent of the country'shospitals and 59 percent of its clinics are in substandardbuildings, some 24 percent of hospitals have no sewage facilities,and 15 percent lack running water.   Chazov also said that the Soviet Union spends less money than anydeveloped country on health care _ 3.2 percent of the Soviet grossnational product _ versus 6 percent to 8 percent in the UnitedStates.</TEXT></DOC>
