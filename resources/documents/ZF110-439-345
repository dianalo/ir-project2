Does NeXThave a secret weapon? How can Lotus outflank Microsoft? Even militaryterminology isn't adequate to describe the carnage that has been going onlately in the relational database software business, what with Oraclereporting its first loss ever, Sybase laying off 5% of its workforce, andIngres seeking refuge in a merger with ASK Computer Systems.andM;Until Oracle dropped its little surprise on Wall Street, the conventionalwisdom was that the database wars were over and Oracle had won.andP;  Oracle,after all, was six times larger than its nearest competitors.andP;  In terms ofmarket share, breadth of product line, and people on the street, Oracle'sfounder and president Larry Ellison had taken most of the high ground insight.andP;  Apparently it's possible to carry these metaphors too far.andP;  Businessis not war - you can have winners without losers, and today's winners can endup losing tomorrow.andP;  Oracle no longer seems invulnerable.andM;We think we've seen only the start of what will be a long campaign.andO;Relational databases, the development tools that make them useful, and theapplications that are built around them are at the core of the networkrevolution.andP;  That means they are the backbone of the information strategiesthat are being put together by every sizable computer customer.andP;  In short,this is no ordinary business.andP;  If it is big now, it is going to be muchbigger.andP;  There ought to be room in it for several significant players.andM;Furthermore, database technology is hardly played out.andP;  For every applicationthat customers have installed, probably ten or a dozen are waiting in linefor the equipment and programmers needed to launch them.andP;  In many cases, thenew applications will require new approaches - to handle multimedia data, totap widely dispersed computer resources, and to play an increasingly activerole in managing information.andM;Many of these applications will run on new hardware platforms.andP;  Despite theobvious slowdown in traditional database products, sales are booming forthose that run on such machines as the UNIX-based multiprocessors made bySequent Computer Systems and Pyramid Technology.andP;  Around 90% of those systemsgo into commercial database-oriented applications.andP;  A host of newmultiprocessor systems will be hitting the mainstream personal computer andworkstation markets in the next few years.andP;  So there ought to be ways todifferentiate and grow through technical innovation, both in product featuresand in hardware support.andM;Bloody but unbowedandM;The three lesser database companies Informix Software, Ingres, and Sybase-have the size and the technology to seize many of those opportunities.andO;Although bloodied, and in the case of Ingres no longer independent, they havesurvived the skirmishes of the 1980s and enter the 1990s with products thatought to be in great demand.andM;Their biggest challenge, it seems to us, is to avoid fighting the wrong war.andO;Clearly, they can't hope to match Oracle's huge salesforce or go mano a manoon the 80 or so hardware platforms that Oracle supports.andP;  What they have todo, above all, is focus their efforts on the markets and technologies wherethey are strongest and send a clear message that tells the world who theyare.andM;Dueling databasesandM;The first priority for these companies has to be getting their financialhouses in order.andP;  When even Oracle is losing money, it's obvious that theproblems in the database market right now are widespread.andP;  On top of thegeneral industry slowdown, probably exacerbated by all the recession talkthis summer, relational database software companies have their own crosses tobear.andM;For one thing, database technology is now so important to many customers thatdecisions are being bucked upstairs from department level managers to MISspecialists or even to top management.andP;  That drags out the selling cycle andmakes it harder to win on purely technical issues.andP;  Most of the easy sales,in other words, have already been made.andP;  Retrenchments on Wall Street, whereSybase has been strong, added to the general softening this year.andO;Discounting and extended payment terms, always fierce in this business,intensified.andP;  In the words of a worried Sybase investor: &quot;These people arekilling each other to grow 150% a year.&quot;andM;New broomandM;Informix, currently the strongest of the runners-up financially, faced up toreality in early 1989 after operating losses of almost $6 million in theprevious two quarters.andP;  New management in the person of Chief Executive PhilWhite and a 15% reduction in force helped to turn things around.andP;  So did anemphasis on selling through computer vendors such as Siemens, ATandamp;T, andUnisys.andM;Informix also pulled out of the VAX market in order to concentrate all itsefforts on UNIX machines after Mr. White decided that a multiplatformstrategy, while valid, wasn't essential.andP;  And Informix has been taking a hardlook at contracts negotiated at very high discounts in the past and seekingbetter terms when they come up for renewal.andP;  As the chart on the next pageshows, Informix has been solidly, if not dramatically, profitable for thepast year.andP;  Nonetheless, its stock has lost 60% of its value in the last fewweeks on second-half jitters; at recent levels of around $7 a share, Informixhas a market value of less than $100 million.andM;Ingres, as the same chart indicates, lost money through the first nine monthsof its June fiscal year and barely managed a small profit in the finalquarter even though sales for the year were up 20%.andP;  ASK's President SandraKurtzig, concerned about management weakness at a key technology supplier andalso looking for new growth vehicles, has agreed to pay $1 10 million for thecompany.andM;We think there are some interesting synergies in this combination, even apartfrom the fact that ASK is using Inges technology as the basis for a newgeneration of its manufacturing-resources-planning software.andP;  But Ms.andO;Kurtzig's first order of business is to make sure that the problems at Ingresand the debt incurred to buy it don't dilute ASK's own effort to improveprofitability.andM;A funny thing happened..andM;The situation at Sybase also seems to require stronger medicine than has beenprescribed so far by President Mark Hoffman.andP;  Sybase, which earned about $3million on sales of $57 million last year, was one of our top picks to gopublic in 1990.andP;  It expected to more than double sales again this year.andP;  Butthe company apparently lost something like $6 million in the first half ofthe year as its North American market went slack while it struggled to absorba 65% employment increase in only a few months.andP;  Mr. Hoffman recently decidedto lay off 50 of his 915 employees, and he expects renewed growth in thesecond half to solve any remaining problems.andM;That is an outcome devoutly to be wished, because Sybase clearly won't be anIPO candidate again, no matter how fast it grows, until it is securely in theblack.andP;  We think Sybase would be hard pressed to raise more private money atthe lofty valuations of its most recent financings (see the table on Page 4),considering what has happened to Ingres and Informix.andP;  If the turnarounddoesn't materialize, we would look for a closer relationship with LotusDevelopment, which has provided Sybase with a cash lifeline recently and nowowns almost 15% of the company.andM;Choosing partnersandM;Such an alignment would make sense for some of the same reasons that theInges-ASK merger seems to add up.andP;  A major problem for all of these companiesis the cost of the sophisticated direct selling empires they feel they haveto maintain.andP;  At Ingres, sales and marketing expenses increased from 68% ofrevenues in fiscal 1989 to 72% in 1990.andP;  Informix, on the other hand, heldselling expenses last year to 59% of revenues, in part by using OEM and valueadded reseller relationships to leverage its internal sales force.andM;ASK will certainly move quickly to streamline the Ingres sales organization,a process that was already under way and now must be accelerated.andP;  The twocompanies don't sell to the same customers, necessarily, but there areseveral overlapping offices and management jobs to be combined.andM;A Sybase-Lotus partnership wouldn't have the same kind of immediate payoff,but Lotus is increasingly looking to sophisticated network applications forgrowth and presumably could make good use of the Sybase sales team.andP;  Just theother day it announced plans to let Sybase distribute 1-2-3 along with itsdrivers for DataLens, the Lotus technology for importing database informationinto a spreadsheet.andP;  Sybase, positioned right in the middle of client-servertechnology, might make even more sense as a merger partner than Novellappeared to.andM;Camels in the tentandM;Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the ASKInges deal is the future role ofEDS and HewlettPackard, which are buying 19.7% and 10%, respectively, of ASK.andO;These aren't just passive investments.andP;  We expect both companies to becomeactive resellers of both ASK and Inges software, encouraging Inges to relymore on relationships with hardware companies like HP and Digital Equipmentand system integrators like EDS to sell the database engine while focusingits own marketing efforts on a rich portfolio of development tools.andP;  Thatwould be one way to offset Oracle's huge marketing advantage.andP;  It would alsoplay into the likely trend of database engines essentially disappearing intothe system software and even being implemented directly in hardware.andP;  As thathappens, database companies will have to work closely with system companiesto ensure that the software is precisely tuned to the hardware - or riskseeing it replaced by a proprietary product.andP;  database companies can helptheir customers deal with the complexities of the product.andP;  Offhand, we can'tthink of any more difficult assignment than developing and maintainingapplications that integrate nicely with the peculiarities of individualcorporate policies and data structures, take advantage of the newesthardware, and look as friendly as a video game.andM;Tooling upandM;Oracle generates a tidy 30% of its revenues from services that help customersdo that kind of thing, and the other companies are constantly under pressurefrom customers to deliver their technology in more digestible form.andP;  Sybasesolved part of the problem in January by acquiring SOL Solutions, a servicesand tools company that has provided a needed source of growth this year aswell as improving support for Sybase customers.andP;  (Previously, it had to walkaway from business that demanded too much in the way of service.) Informixand Inges have been expanding their use of hotlines and customized serviceprograms in order to raise the level of customer comfort.andM;In the long run, the best way to improve service will be to cut the need forit.andP;  The obvious trend here is to enhance development tools and packagedapplications so as to reduce the customer's burden without increasing thesupplier's headaches.andP;  Informix moved in that direction with its acquisitionof Innovative Software in 1988, but it has taken longer than expected to getInnovative's Wingz graphical spreadsheet out on a variety of machinestogether with an interface linking it to Informix databases.andM;Actually, it was the HyperScript development language Innovative used towrite Wingz that intrigued Informix's chairman Roger Sippl, who was lookingfor an easy way for database customers to set up executive informationsystems.andP;  The idea, in part, was to encourage customers to do their owncustom tailoring.andP;  Now that the pieces are in place, Informix finds that itsrevenues are about equally divided among database engines, development tools,and office automation applications.andM;ASK and answerandM;In the same way, it was Ingres' strength in development tools that led ASK tobecome first a customer and then a suitor.andP;  ASK's view was and is that thedatabase itself will eventually be a generic technology and that the criticalfactor in choosing a database supplier should be the tools it provides.andP;  WithOracle crowding into its markets with manufacturing software, ASK neededtools that would get sophisticated applications to market quickly.andP;  The firstfruit of this strategy, a general ledger product that competes with an Oracleapplication, will be going to customer tests in the next few weeks.andP;  Once themerger is complete, we'd expect to see ASK use the Ingres technology tofurther broaden its applications reach.andP;  And the emphasis in future Ingresmarketing, we're confident, will be its tools.andM;Power tripandM;Sybase, while no slouch in the tools department, is best known for thetransaction-processing performance of its database engine.andP;  If there is anadvantage to entering a market late, it is the ability to leapfrog earlierapproaches to take advantage of new technology.andP;  Sybase did that bystructuring its SQL Server database architecture for a client-server network,although at the time (1984) relational database systems ran mainly onminicomputers and mainframes.andM;The Sybase approach, which essentially involves a redistribution of tasksbetween client and server, or application and database, increased theperformance of Sun workstations and other single-processor systems in highvolume transaction processing and got the company off to a flying start.andP;  Butthe performance image gradually diminished as the competition improved and asmultiprocessor systems started pushing transaction rates into thestratosphere.andP;  Only this year was Sybase finally able to deliver amultiprocessor version of SQL Server for Stratus Computers and make seriousplans to move it to Sequent and Silicon Graphics systems.andM;It may be that Sybase can recapture the performance crown, but we're not surethat matters as much now as other issues, some of which are out of thecompany's hands.andM;Friends in needandM;Given the sluggish start for OS/2 applications, Sybase doesn't stand togenerate a lot of revenues from this product right away.andP;  But it's importantstrategically.andP;  One is the progress of SQL Server for OS/2, which with thesupport of Microsoft and Ashton-Tate was supposed to become the preeminentrelational database engine for personal computers and attract excitingfront-end applications.andP;  That could still happen, now that Microsoft hastaken on responsibility for selling the product, but the fits and starts inmarketing and support have given competitors an opportunity to target thatmarket.andM;Another source of applications should be Lotus, which is committed tooptimizing 1-2-3 for SQL Server.andP;  Lotus has also joined Oracle's third-partysupport program and couldn't be expected to ignore that installed base evenif it owned Sybase outright.andP;  But the relationship should pay off asspreadsheets and other applications linked to database servers take on newresponsibilities for controlling corporate information and enforcingcorporate policies.andM;Active voiceandM;Indeed, the changing role of the database offers perhaps the most fruitfulopportunity for the also-rans to be up-and-comers.andP;  We think database systemswill move in this decade from being passive repositories of data to activelymanaging not just data but knowledge - the accumulated rules and proceduresthat organizations use to make sense of raw information and act on it.andO;Providing this capability and the tools to tailor it to individual needsshould be one way to stand out from the crowd.andM;There are various ways to do this.andP;  Sybase provides  triggers,&quot; subroutinesthat go into action to send a message or activate another query when certainevents occur, as a standard feature of SQL Server.andP;  The latest version ofINGRES (the product) adds a centralized rule system that can respond toevents by carrying out virtually any computational task.andP;  Of course, it'salso possible to put this kind of intelligence into an application, but thatcan become a tedious programming chore.andM;Object lessonandM;A related development is the growing need to store unconventional data, suchas images, spatial coordinates, or voice files, which conventional databasescan't handle.andP;  This is already a pressing requirement for many technicalapplications, and a number of new companies using object-oriented programmingtechnology have sprung up to serve that market.andP;  Demand should explode whenand if multimedia computing enters the office.andP;  Both Informix and Inges nowoffer the ability to store objects, with the difference that Informix leavesthe manipulating to the application while Ingres allows the database itselfto know what to do with a picture of Mars or a Puccini aria.andM;In the short term, these new technologies are likely to be less importantthan core products, and here the three database dwarfs all seem to be fullycompetitive with Oracle and with each other at long last.andP;  Ingres inparticular has been through an agonizing process of reorienting and upgradingthat required some 200 person-years of development work.andP;  Informix now hastwo database products, one for fast transaction processing and another forless demanding applications.andP;  And Sybase, as noted, has reasserted its claimto performance leadership.andP;  All of these companies should benefit from newaccess technologies that allow them to tap into data on third-party systems.andO;Eventually, the movement toward industry standards in the department shoulderode some of the advantage that Oracle derives from supporting so manyhardware platforms.andM;Do the right thingandM;The problem now, assuming that financial controls are firmly in place, is tomake the hard strategic decisions that will provide growth once this softspot in the market is history.andP;  With technical considerations approachingparity, it should be more apparent than ever that shotgun marketing won'twork.andP;  Perhaps one or more of these companies will be big enough someday totake on Oracle across the board.andP;  Right now, they aren't.andP;  Even Oracle mayhave learned that it is trying to do too much too fast.andP;  What's called forare strategies targeted to the most appropriate hardware platforms andmarkets and an emphasis on shepherding customers through a difficulttechnical transition.andP;  And no more heavy artillery, if you please.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
