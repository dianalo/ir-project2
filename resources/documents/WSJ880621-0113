No problem, suppliers told him. But you'll have to wait four or five months.    &quot;Everybody was telling me, 'You're not going to see that stuff before October,'&quot; says Mr. Sentker, of Richards Industries Inc. &quot;Six months ago we were talking about six- to eight-week lead times.&quot;    That's the kind of report that makes inflation-watchers everywhere nervous. American industry is operating at closer to full capacity than at any time in the past eight years. Foreign demand for U.S. products is booming. The next recession is nowhere in sight.    &quot;If the domestic economy doesn't get out of the way&quot; to make room for continued growth in exports, says Adrian Dillon, economist for Eaton Corp., &quot;then in six months we've got a problem.&quot;    Businessmen, economists, Federal Reserve officials and others are scanning the horizon for early signs of a surge in inflation. One place they look is in offices like Mr. Sentker's to see if the economy is growing so fast that suppliers are having trouble keeping up with demand. &quot;Historically, (longer lead times) have been one of the precursors of somewhat higher prices,&quot; says Robert Black, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va.    Already, the prices manufacturers pay for chemicals, metal parts and other so-called intermediate goods have climbed at an annual rate of 9.2% in the past three months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. &quot;There's no doubt that if you're seeing capacity being utilized almost to the fullest, and if you've got people who need the stuff, you're going to see prices go up,&quot; said Frederick Bartz, purchasing manager for Premier Industrial Corp. in Cleveland.    Across the country, manufacturers say lead times for certain goods are getting longer. Plastics such as polyethylene, polystyrene and polypropylene &quot;are very hard to come by,&quot; says Wally Werner, purchasing director for Emhart Corp. of Farmington, Conn. &quot;If you're not a (long-established) customer, you're not likely to get materials.&quot; Stainless steel, caustic soda, certain bearings and paper materials are reported to be scarce.    Mr. Bartz, who surveys Cleveland companies each month for the local purchasing managers association, said he began to notice an increase in lead times about three months ago. The National Association of Purchasing Managers says 19% of members surveyed last month said it took longer to get deliveries than the month before; only 5% reported faster deliveries.    In the nation's manufacturing belt, however, the problem is far more acute. The association's Chicago affiliate says that 37% of the manufacturers surveyed last month reported slower deliveries; 5% said deliveries were quicker.    &quot;We have found over the last six to 10 months, with increasing regularity, a number of our members reporting shortages of basic raw materials,&quot; says Robert Bretz, a Pitney Bowes Co. purchasing manager who oversees the association's national survey. Some shortages are showing up in &quot;fabricated components made from those basic raw materials, and I think we'll probably continue to see more of those,&quot; he adds.    According to Roger Guffey, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo., the situation &quot;raises some modest concerns.&quot; Whether &quot;modest concerns&quot; turn into the more serious variety, he said, depends on the appearance of bottlenecks in more and more industries.    In a speech last week, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said lead times &quot;have essentially, though perhaps temporarily, stabilized during the past five months,&quot; but added that the data &quot;don't represent conclusive evidence.&quot; In the cautious words that central bankers use, Mr. Greenspan concluded, &quot;The situation will have to be monitored carefully if we are to avoid an acceleration in inflation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
