If approved by a federal court in Manhattan, thesettlement will clear the way for investors to begincollecting damage claims from a fund set up by the Securitiesand Exchange Commission in 1986 with money turned over by Mr.Boesky.</LP><TEXT>   The settlement amount includes $8.3 million to becontributed by some Boesky-related defendants, including thenow-defunct Ivan Boesky andamp; Co., some of Mr. Boesky's fomerlimited partnerships, and Cambrian andamp; General Securities PLC,a British investment fund once controlled by Mr. Boesky.   Under the settlement, $30 million will first be paid outof the SEC fund for the so-called &quot;first tier&quot; of claimants-- investors who had losses from Mr. Boesky's alleged insidertrading on tips from Dennis Levine, a former Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc. investment banker. Those transactions involvetrading in 1985 and 1986 in the securities of Nabisco BrandsInc., Houston Natural Gas Corp., General Foods Corp.,American Natural Resources Co., Union Carbide Corp. and FMCCorp.   The rest of the settlement will be used to pay&quot;second-tier&quot; claims from investors in the securities ofseveral other companies allegedly manipulated in Boeskytransactions that violated securities law.   Mr. Boesky pleaded guilty to insider trading in 1986 andwas sentenced to three years in prison. He also settled anSEC civil suit by agreeing to pay a total of $100 inpenalties and returned profits allegedly made from insidertrading.   Robert McCaw, an attorney for Mr. Boesky, said thesettlement will resolve all the class-action shareholderclaims against Mr. Boesky. The plaintiffs can still seekdamages, however, from other defendants accused of takingpart in the alleged stock-manipulation schemes.   In federal court in Manhattan, Judge Milton Pollackordered that a so-called fairness hearing be held March 26 todetermine whether final approval of the settlement should begiven.   Barry Goldsmith, an attorney with the SEC, said thatinvestors who have valid claim could receive payments fromthe Boesky settlement fund within a few months. Investorsmust file their claims by May 15.   David Berger, one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs,said that notice of the settlement will be sent to 40,000investors who have indicated they may be claimants. Investorsalso will be sent &quot;proof of claim&quot; forms, which ask forinformation about the transactions. Investors will have toprove that their claims are valid, and then claims will bepaid based on the amount of the investors' losses on thetransactions.   The amount of claims is expected to exceed the settlementamount, said Mr. Goldsmith. That means investors will likelyreceive a pro-rated share of their actual losses. &quot;Generallywhen you are distributing money there's no shortage ofclaimants,&quot; Mr. Goldsmith said.   In making their claims, investors have to submit detailsabout their stock transactions. The claim form also gives thetime frame during which each security was affected by theBoesky transactions; only investors who had losses on tradesduring that period can collect.   Judge Pollack appointed Heffler andamp; Co., of Philadelphia, asadministrator of settlement. Investors who believe theyqualify for claims under the first tier of transactions canwrite to the administrator for a claim form. The SEC isexpected to set guidelines for the second-tier claims in afew months.   Mr. Berger said he expects about $8 million of the $53.3million to go to plaintiffs' attorneys fees.   ---   CREDIT UNION embezzlement case produces guilty plea.   The man who oversaw one of the largest failures in U.S.credit union history pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court inOmaha, Neb., yesterday to embezzlement and misapplication ofcredit union funds.   Lawrence E. King Jr., who reigned over Franklin CommunityCredit Union before federal regulators closed it in November1988, also pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making falsestatements to credit union regulators. Each of the threecounts carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison anda $250,000 fine. Sentencing is scheduled for May 13.   The government alleged in its May 1989 indictment that theKing family received millions in credit union funds over aperiod of years. It said the complicated scheme includedmeetings between Mr. King and a credit union accountant toprepare fake ledger cards.   The credit union, set up in the 1960s to serve the poor,lost about $40 million. That made it the second-largestfailure in credit union history.   Before the failure, Mr. King was known for his lavish lifestyle, political connections and generous contributions tocharitable and political causes. The plea by the 46-year-oldMr. King, who was the credit union's manager, came just threeweeks before he was scheduled to go to trial on 40 counts inconnection with the credit union's failure. The governmentagreed to drop the additional charges.   Mr. King's wife, Alice, agreed yesterday to a one-countinformation charging her with making false statements on anincome tax return. That carries a maximum penalty of threeyears in prison and a $25,000 fine.   ---   RECESSION TAKES TOLL on recruiting at law schools.   A study by the National Association for Law Placementshows that law firms recruited less aggressively last fallthan in recent years. According to the survey of 80 schoolsand 281 employers, many firms have decreased their hiringgoals. More than half of the law schools experienced adecline in on-campus interviewing, and many found that moreemployers were canceling interviews than in the past.   &quot;There was definitely a decline in recruiting activity,but it was not an enormous decline,&quot; said Lujuana WolfeTreadwell, NALP's executive director.   The organization of law firm placement professionals andlaw firm recruiters conducted the survey because of thenoticeable shift in the recruiting climate and an increase instudents' anxiety about their futures.   Judith Lhamon, Director of Career Planning and Placementat Yale Law School and a member of NALP's board of directors,said many students are trying to avoid large law firms in theNortheast, where the profession has been particularly hardhit by the recession.   &quot;Students are reluctant to commit themselves to placesthat may let them go in a year,&quot; she said.</TEXT></DOC>
