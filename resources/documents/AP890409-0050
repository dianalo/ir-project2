(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Engine failure may have caused the crashof a military helicopter that injured six Marines on a trainingexercise, an Army commander said Sunday.   In a separate accident, a medical helicopter crashed on takeoffSunday from a Houston hospital parking lot, seriously injuring thethree crew members.   The Houston crash was the second this year in Texas of theBK-117, made by the MBB Helicopter Corp. of West Germany. The firstwreck also involved a medical crew.   The commander of Fort McCoy, Army Col. Raymond Boland, saidinitial reports of the military crash suggested the UH-1helicopter's engine failed two miles north of the base headquartersSaturday afternoon.   Another officer, Marine Capt. Richard Jessen of the GlenviewNaval Air Station, where some of the injured Marines were based,said it could take weeks to find the cause.   The UH-1 is one of the older helicopter models employed by theU.S. armed forces. It was one of the principal aircraft used in theVietnam war.   Fort McCoy spokeswoman Mary Binder said the three crew membersand three passengers were taken to St. Mary's Hospital in nearbySparta for treatment. Five were treated and released while thepilot remained hospitalized Sunday with minor injuries, she said.   In Houston, a police officer said he saw the medical helicopterdrifting backward toward an eight-story parking garage at HermannHospital shortly before the crash, prompting speculation the tailrotor may have smashed into the structure.   But a medical emergency official said the pilot reported afterthe crash that the helicopter malfunctioned on takeoff. There wereswirling winds at the time.   The three victims were listed in serious and guarded condition.They suffered spinal damage and were being examined for internalinjuries, said Dr. Kenneth Wells. The pilot struck the controls andinjured his face.   Officials at the hospital said their Life Flight emergencymedical program has flown more than 35,000 patient missions withonly one previous accident since it began service in 1976.

Three people were killed on Valentine's Day when a helicopter ofthe same model crashed in a wooded area while attempting to returnto a hospital in Tyler, 200 miles north of Houston.</TEXT></DOC>
