In addition, the Soviet Minister of Posts andTelecommunications said at a joint news conference with U SWest that his country will join the InternationalTelecommunications Satellite Organization, becoming theconsortium's 121st member. The Soviet Union has used Intelsatsatellites for many years; by joining the consortium, theSoviet Union picks up certain benefits, including training ofits employees in telecommunications technology.</LP><TEXT>   U S West said it will finance and operate the digitalswitching systems, which are expected to greatly improve flowof telephone calls into and out of the Soviet Union. Thethree switches will be built by a Yugoslavian equipmentmaker, Nikola Tesla, under license from L. M. Ericsson ofSweden; they will be installed in Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev.   U S West's investment is relatively small -- $18 millionover two years -- but the potential could be substantial. Thecompany said it will receive 16% of revenue over 15 yearsfrom calls switched through the new gateways, which areexpected to be in operation by the end of 1992. Today, theSoviet Union has a single international gateway in Moscow,providing about 1,200 circuits. The new switches will add15,000 international circuits in Moscow and 4,000 circuitseach in Leningrad and Kiev.   Dick McCormick, U S West president and chief executiveofficer, called the three gateway switches &quot;the cornerstonefor the telecommunications infrastructure modernization inthe Soviet Union.&quot; The company, he said, viewed the switchingproject as a strong stand-alone venture. But even moreimportant, Mr. McCormick said U S West sees many long-termopportunities in the Soviet Union, where there is onetelephone for every 13 people, compared with 50 or 60 phonesper 100 people in most developed countries.   G.G. Kudriavtsev, the Soviet Union's minister ofcommunications, who has been in the U.S. for meetings withgovernment and industry officials, said in an interview thathe estimates it will cost as much as $200 million to improvehis country's international telecommunications. The ministryis also working to upgrade domestic telephone systems, but isplanning to use only its national currency for those projectsand will rely on Soviet design and technology, which is lessexpensive.   The Moscow cellular project, designed to improvecommunications for emergency services, businesses andgovernment agencies, is expected to begin operating laterthis year. U S West holds a 22% interest; Millicom Inc.'sMillicom International Cellular affiliate will hold 20%; theFyodorov Eye Microsurgery Science and Technology Complex, runby Moscow businessman Stanislav Fyodorov, will hold 8%; andthe Soviet Ministry will hold the remaining 50%.   Mr. Kudriavtsev said that the cellular system would takeabout five years to build and would likely remain small,serving perhaps 60,000 subscribers. Personal communicationsnetworks, he said, hold greater promise for more widespreaduse.   The ventures aren't the first alliances between the SovietUnion and U S West. The company is building a cellular systemin Leningrad, and is working on alternatives to the TransSoviet Line, a proposed fiber optic cable. The fiber-opticproject was rejected by an international body that determineswhich technologies can be shipped to Communist countries.   As for payments from the Soviet Union, a country with aprecarious economy, Mr. McCormick acknowledged some risks,but said they were outweighed by possible rewards. Mr.Kudriavtsev said payments would be made in hard currency.   The Soviet communications minister also said that he hasbeen working with American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. toestablish new services in the Soviet Union. Last year, ATandamp;Tintroduced video conferencing capabilities there, and hassold an international gateway switch to the Republic ofArmenia.   Just last week, GTE Corp. announced it is forming a jointventure with the Soviet ministry to build and operate atelephone and facsimile service linking Moscow with Asia andthe West.</TEXT></DOC>
