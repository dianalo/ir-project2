Buoyed by acquisitions, Aegon was able to compensate for the effect on revenue growth of currency-translation losses and tough competition. Total revenue jumped 15%, to 9.2 billion guilders ($4.88 billion) from eight billion guilders in 1986. The figures exclude unconsolidated revenue from the U.S. annuity business, which rose to 1.2 billion guilders last year from 908 million guilders in 1986.    Aegon's results were better than expected by many analysts and investors. Aegon rose 1.20 guilders (64 cents), to 75.90 guilders, on Amsterdam's stock exchange Friday.    The company said that it is benefiting from efforts to cut costs and improve efficiency and that, barring unforeseen circumstances, it likely will &quot;show a light increase in net profit in 1988 in comparison with 1987.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
