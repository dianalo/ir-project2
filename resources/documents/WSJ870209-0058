The big West German electronics company approached the personal-computer market gingerly, waiting until rivals' sales were booming before producing its first model in 1984. For the past few years, it has sat on a cash hoard equivalent to $10.8 billion, rather than jeopardize it in unpredictable business ventures. Its reputation for caution probably is overstated, but Siemens is known in West Germany as the bank that's also involved in electronics.    But now Siemens is taking one of its biggest risks ever, gambling more than $1.35 billion on a campaign to expand its world-wide telecommunications business.    As part of the drive, it has mounted simultaneous sales efforts in the U.S., France, Belgium, Taiwan, Italy and Japan. It made a rare foray into the corporate takeover game, buying control of part of the telecommunications-equipment business of a rival, GTE Corp. of the U.S.    And it assigned 3,000 engineers to perfect its main product, a computerized telephone exchange. In its haste to peddle these new, $3 million-plus exchanges, it even tried a sales tactic unheard of in its industry: It loaded one of the delicate machines onto a van and drove it around the U.S. from one potential client to another, like a door-to-door salesman.    Given Siemens's enormous cash resources and favorable reputation for telephone technology, the odds are good that the German company will win its gamble. If it does, it could overtake its closest rival, French-controlled Alcatel N.V., as the world's second-biggest maker of telecommunications equipment. And it could give No. 1 American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. a tough fight in the big U.S. phone-gear market.    But its efforts could be hampered by tough competition, potential technical difficulties and -- most important -- political troubles.    In the past year, Siemens's aggressive lobbying tactics to win contracts in France and the U.S. have riled politicians, jeopardizing its success in those countries. At the company's request, German government ministers last autumn lobbied French officials to buy telephone exchanges from Siemens rather than from a rival venture involving ATandamp;T and N.V. Philips of the Netherlands.    The German lobbying ruffled feathers in France and prompted ATandamp;T's powerful backers in Washington to threaten curbs against Siemens imports to the U.S. Bewildered by all the maneuvering, the French postponed a decision until the spring.    Politics is &quot;the critical factor&quot; that could halt Siemens's expansion drive, says Edward Mier, head European telecommunications analysts for Dataquest Inc., a U.S.-based market-research firm. &quot;They've got to tread very carefully,&quot; he says.    ATandamp;T officials in New York play down the notion that Siemens represents a threat in the U.S. &quot;Siemens and other non-U.S. telecommunications manufacturers have correctly targeted the U.S. switch market as a major growth area,&quot; says E. Wayne Weeks, president of ATandamp;T's Network Systems. &quot;We welcome the chance to pit our technology and quality against competitors.&quot;    He adds that ATandamp;T expects the same treatment abroad that outsiders enjoy in America. &quot;It's precisely because there is such healthy competition in the U.S. that we believe we should be able to compete against these same companies in other markets, including their own, without government or other interference,&quot; Mr. Weeks says.    If Siemens should falter in its marketing drive, it would become just the latest in a series of telecommunications-industry casualties. ITT Corp. recently sold control of its telecommunications business to Alcatel; similarly, Siemens last year bought control of part of GTE's telecommunications-equipment business for $420 million.    &quot;It's a revolution within the electronics industry,&quot; says Karl Frensch, Siemens's executive director of telephone-exchange marketing, about the mergers that have swept the industry. Given the turmoil, he says, &quot;the only possibility is to expand.&quot;    Though the company's sales and earnings are stagnating right now, Siemens officials express confidence that their gamble in telecommunications will pay off. Says Hans Baur, head of the Siemens division that makes its big telephone exchanges, &quot;Our long-term battle is one of being technically competitive, and we're feeling pretty good.&quot;    When trying to sell outside West Germany, Siemens's close government ties traditionally have been among its biggest assets. In the Third World, for instance, its sales offers are often linked with German government pledges of economic aid.    But Bonn's recent attempt to influence the outcome of a battle between Siemens and the ATandamp;T-Philips joint venture for control of the French telecommunications concern Cie. Generale des Constructions Telephoniques, or CGCT, seems to have backfired.    Angered by the German lobbying, U.S. trade and Federal Communications Commission officials threatened Bonn with restrictions on Siemens's exports to the U.S. Any effort to carry out the threats would jeopardize Siemens's target of expanding its less-than-1% share of the U.S. market for telephone exchanges to 10%, an increase valued at $220 million annually.    &quot;They (Siemens) stumbled into something they didn't expect,&quot; says Kenneth Donow, director of research at Technology Analysis Group, a Washington-based consulting firm.    If they are alarmed, top Siemens officials don't say so publicly. Mr. Baur, as head of Siemens's biggest telecommunications division, calls the political fuss &quot;exaggerated&quot; and says the arguing doesn't involve Siemens. &quot;We sell technology, not politics,&quot; he says.    Politics aside, Siemens's strongest points in its sales drive are good products and a reputation for good technology. It sells a whole range of communications equipment, from basic telephone sets to glass-fiber phone cables. But its flagship product is its computerized telephone exchange, called the EWSD.    The EWSD's first customers seem pleased. &quot;We've never bought such a key system of telecommunications with such high technology in such a short time and at such a good price,&quot; says a German postal official.    Nevertheless, industry analysts say they don't think the product is profitable yet. (A Siemens spokesman declines to comment, saying only that orders are increasing.)    And despite the EWSD's high technological grades so far, Siemens still is scrambling to adapt it to the differing technical requirements of U.S. telephone companies. The risks are enormous: A big factor in ITT's decision to sell control of its phone business was the failure to adapt its European-designed exchange, System 12, to U.S. technical standards.    And time is short. After U.S. market leaders ATandamp;T and Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada, Siemens's prime competitors for a piece of the market are Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson and Japan's Nippon Electric Corp. So far, Siemens leads the newcomers, with trial orders for the EWSD at five of the seven regional U.S. phone companies.    But Ericsson is close behind, with three trial orders. The next two years, analysts say, will decide which company graduates beyond these small orders to a status as a mainstream supplier in the U.S.    Siemens's managers don't appear to be underestimating the risks. Says Mr. Frensch, the marketing manager: &quot;Up to now, we have had good success&quot; in the U.S. market. &quot;But the work still has to be done. There are many, many obstacles.&quot;    ---                  Prosperous Years at Siemens  (In billions of dollars, for fiscal years ended inSeptember) YEAR             SALES             PROFIT             Randamp;D 1986             $25.4             $0.794           $2.92 1985              29.5              0.827            2.59 1984              24.8              0.578            2.05 1983              21.4              0.434            1.89 1982              21.7              0.399            1.84    NOTE: All figures converted at the mark's current rate</TEXT></DOC>
