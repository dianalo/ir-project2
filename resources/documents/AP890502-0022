Administration officials now are reluctantly conceding that Bushmay only stick to the pledge for a year, and that higher taxes maybe part of a fiscal 1991 budget agreement.   One possibility actively being considered is a swap tradingWhite House support for some new taxes, most likely on gasoline,for concessions from Congress in other areas, like a cut in thecapital gains tax rate, said the sources, speaking on the conditionof anonymity.   Bush has long made chopping the capital gains tax rate a keyitem, claiming it will eventually raise revenue for the Treasury.But it has found scant support in the Democratic controlledCongress, which questions the logic of trying to raise revenue bycutting taxes.   Despite Bush's rhetoric against new taxes, reiterated asrecently as Monday in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,many economists say higher taxes seem all but inevitable to get thefederal deficit _ estimated at $163 billion this year _ undercontrol.   In fact, to many analysts, it was only a matter of time beforethe administration conceded that some forms of tax hikes wereneeded.   Administration officials still haven't done this publicly. Butprivately they admit contingency planning is under way on new taxes_ and on what tradeoffs the administration might be able to wrestfrom Congress in exchange for White House support for them.   Even the no-new-taxes budget compromise Bush recently reachedwith Congress for fiscal year 1990 calls for $5.3 billion inunspecified new revenues.   Bush has claimed that slashing the capital gains tax from thepresent 28 percent to 15 percent will produce the bulk of this,$4.8 billion. But since Congress seems unlikely to go along withthis tax cut, some way must still be found this year to come upwith the $5.3 billion.   And, a weakening economy could make the projected 1990 deficiteven larger than the $98.6 billion Bush projected in his budgetsubmission to Congress _ meaning even more ``new revenues'' will beneeded to meet deficit targets of the Gramm-Rudman law.   That budget-balancing act requires a deficit of no more than$100 billion in fiscal 1990 _ or automatic across-the-board cutsare triggered.   Budget Director Richard Darman will issue revised economicassumptions on the economy on July 15.   Some administration sources suggested that agas-tax-for-capital-gains-cut deal might even be considered asearly as then, if the new economic numbers prove to be gloomy.   But generally, administration officials said the president'sclear intention was to honor his campaign vow through this year.   After that, all bets are off.   Bush on Monday showed no indication he was ready to make a deal,however. In his speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, he said:``I mean to live by what I've said: No new taxes.''   Bush told the Chamber of Commerce, ``We don't have to raisetaxes. We have to release the energies of free enterprise.'' Hesaid his ``favorite source of new revenue'' was the capital gainstax cut.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Monday, ``Weare talking to the tax-writing committees about it (the capitalgains tax cut). But we wouldn't want to speculate on how it mightcome out at this time.''   The notion of a deal trading support for higher gasoline taxesfor a cut in the capital gains tax was first raised the weekendbefore last in a session between Bush and a group of economists atthe presidential retreat in Camp David, Md.   Although Bush was generally noncommittal, he did not object todiscussing possible higher taxes, and the proposed swap wasendorsed by some of the economists present, according to thesources.   The federal gasoline tax is now 9.1 cents per gallon.   There have been a variety of congressional proposals for raisingthe gasoline tax for amounts ranging from a few cents up to 50cents a gallon. However, a major obstacle to any such rise is theopposition of Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen,D-Texas.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Tom Raum covers the White House for TheAssociated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
