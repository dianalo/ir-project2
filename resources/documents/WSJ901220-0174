Inholding firm to the arrangement, which sets a medianexchange-rate of 2.95 marks for the pound, Mr. Lamont dashedhopes for a Yuletide cut in interest rates or a realignmentwithin the European Monetary System.   Meanwhile, government figures released separately showedthat the British economy contracted by 1.2% between thesecond and third quarters this year. Amid such signs that theU.K. recession is proving to be harsher than anticipated,industry officials have stepped up a campaign for a cut inbase rates, which stand at 14%.   The Confederation of British Industries' latest surveyreported that the manufacturing sector expects the biggestfalloff in production in 10 years.                                                                                                          THE EC LOOKS EAST                                                                                                          The European Community will begin today to negotiateaccords with Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary that couldeventually lead to membership in the 12-nation bloc. The ECsaid the accords would set up free trade in manufacturedgoods and strengthen economic and cultural cooperation.Provisions for financial assistance from the community may beincluded in the accords, the EC said.                                                                                                          SAS PLANE FOR VIETNAM AIRLINES?   Scandinavian Airline System plans to lease one of itsBoeing 767 jets to Vietnam Airlines. However, Kjell Fredheim,head of SAS Airline, said, &quot;A prerequisite for the signing isthe approval of the U.S. government.&quot; He added: &quot;We will notenter an agreement that violates American regulations.&quot; Ifthe deal goes through, the aircraft will operate betweenThailand and Vietnam.                                                                                                          REFORESTING THE AMAZON                                                                                                          Brazil has approved the first major plan to reforest partof the Amazon, at a cost of $3 billion, officials said. Theplan, to be funded by private industry and foreigncontributions, envisages the reforestation of 2.5 millionacres over 10 years. The state mining concern Companhia Valedo Rio Doce, which helped draft the project, said that theproject should begin within a year.                                                                                                          SOUTH KOREA'S TRADE POSITION                                                                                                          South Korea told the U.S. it would review its position onglobal trade in an effort to contribute to the success ofstalled trade talks. Seoul officials said the U.S. complainedthat South Korea had sided with the European Community andJapan on the thorny farm-subsidy issue in the Uruguay Roundnegotiations that broke down in Brussels earlier this month.South Korea also promised efforts to prevent the country'scontroversial frugality campaign from discriminating againstimported goods.                                                                                                          `FORGOTTEN EMERGENCY'                                                                                                          A 10-month civil war has made Liberia the world's biggesthuman tragedy at present, but there has been no response to aUnited Nations appeal for aid, a U.N. relief official said.   &quot;It's a forgotten emergency,&quot; said Frank Verhaegen, seniorrelief coordinator with the U.N. Disaster ReliefOrganization. &quot;Government structures are non-existent,hospitals are not functioning, no one has been vaccinatedsince the beginning of the year and agriculture is at astandstill.&quot;   Mr. Verhaegen said an aid appeal launched by U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Dec. 5 had goneunheeded. &quot;The response from the international community hasbeen zero,&quot; he said. &quot;There has been an embarrassing silence. . . at a time when everyone is rushing to the rescue of theSoviet Union.&quot;   Mr. Verhaegen said some countries, including the U.S.,were probably waiting for a political settlement beforeoffering aid. &quot;In the meantime,&quot; he said, &quot;the lives ofthousands of Liberians, some threatened by famine-relateddiseases, are at risk.&quot;                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          In Australia, the top of the Sydney Opera House sported ahuge pair of sunglasses yesterday, put there by theenvironmental group Greenpeace. The inflatable sunglasses --70 feet wide by 20 feet high -- were accompanied by a bannerthat read: &quot;Ozone Depletion: stop it or we'll go blind.&quot; Aportable generator inflated the glasses at about 6:30 a.m.,and they stayed in place for about an hour until policepulled the plug. . . . Four out of 10 Britons are bored witheating turkey at Christmas, according to a new poll. Thesurvey, by Market andamp; Opinion Research International, showedsalmon and duck as top choices for alternative Yuletide fare.</TEXT></DOC>
