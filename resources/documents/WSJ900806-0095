This account, provided by a senior State Departmentofficial, underscores the new Soviet willingness to cooperatewith the U.S. But just as the Soviets are powerless to forcePresident Saddam Hussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait,so too are the superpowers limited in how far they can usetheir newfound unity to ease tensions among their clientnations elsewhere -- in Afghanistan, Southeast Asia andCentral America.</LP><TEXT>   As the superpower conflict ends, the Soviets are no longerinterested in dominating Third World states. Moreover, theirforeign aid is declining rapidly because of domesticproblems. For the U.S., the end of the Cold War means thatthe nations that once followed Washington because it wastheir shield against communism are now more inclined to gotheir own way. And pressing domestic needs prevent the U.S.,like the Soviet Union, from buying influence abroad.   &quot;When something bad happens, the Soviets no longer assumeit's us causing it and we no longer assume it's them,&quot; saysBurton Pines, senior vice president of the conservativeHeritage Foundation. &quot;Now the question is how much leveragedo we {the superpowers} have over everybody else?&quot;   Moscow and Washington have been edging closer, forexample, to a common formula to resolve the thorny issue ofCambodia. When the five permanent members of the UnitedNations Security Council met in Paris in January, the Sovietssupported the general idea of elections there, but wouldn'tgo along with setting up an international structure thatwould have authority to actually administer an election.   Last week, when Secretary of State James Baker discussedthis issue with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadzeduring talks in Irkutsk, Siberia, the Soviets endorsed a moreactive role for the United Nations and for a Supreme NationalCouncil in an election process. &quot;It sure looked like ourpositions were not very far apart,&quot; says a U.S. official whoparticipated in the sessions.   But getting real-world benefit from the agreement may beanother matter. U.S. officials aren't sure that Moscow canget Vietnam, which installed the government in Cambodia, tocooperate. Soviet aid to Vietnam has declined, and thesubstantial assistance that Hanoi once received from Moscow'sformer East European satellites has evaporated.   &quot;Nobody knows how much leverage the Soviets still haveover Vietnam until they try to use it,&quot; says a U.S. official.   Concerning Afghanistan, Moscow and Washington are steadilynarrowing their differences but neither superpower is able toimpose solutions on the participants. Some of the U.S.-backedmujahedeen guerrillas fighting Afghanistan's Communistgovernment are Islamic fundamentalists who are asanti-American as they are anti-Soviet. And, one U.S. analystsays, Moscow has never been succeeded in exercising totalcontrol in Afghanistan.   Similarly, in El Salvador, Moscow &quot;has made clear to usthat they'll make every effort to support a politicalprocess,&quot; says a senior State Department official. &quot;But wejust can't say if they will be able to deliver,&quot; he adds.Leftist guerrillas in El Salvador still are being supplied byCuba, which shows no signs of bending to Moscow's newcooperative line.   Mr. Pines of the Heritage Foundation says the newU.S.-Soviet partnership may be most effective in bolsteringthe efforts of the United Nations and other internationalorganizations in underdeveloped countries. During the ColdWar, many of these nations became embroiled in the East-Westideological struggle and adopted Marxist economies. Nearlyall have become economic basket cases.   Now, Moscow could join the U.S. in promoting free marketeconomics. &quot;All the Soviets would have to do is take some ofthe resolutions passed recently by the Moscow city council,send them off to places like Tanzania and say, try this,&quot;concludes Mr. Pines.</TEXT></DOC>
