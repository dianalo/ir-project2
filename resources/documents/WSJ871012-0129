The dialogue form -- exchanges between character Bell and his fictitious heroine, Geneva Crenshaw, a black civil rights attorney and law professor -- enables author Bell (who is black) to be provocative without appearing dogmatic.    We eavesdrop on conversations between committed black scholars who confidently and credibly express their qualms and quarrels about a future strategy for black Americans. In the fictional chronicles we behold a series of spectacles and mysteries: Ms. Crenshaw appears at the Constitutional Convention; the children of wealthy whites have their color and character transformed; a disease materializes that strikes only at single professional black women; pebbles are found to cure black criminality. These tales revolve around a variety of themes, including voting rights and proportional representation, the benefits and harms of school desegregation, the limits of legal remedies, and &quot;the social affliction of racism.&quot; Each conversation discusses or refers to underlying scholarship.    We are propelled by consuming rage, lifted up by transcendent hope and shattered by the return to the reality of the black condition today. At every turn, in Bell and Crenshaw's conversations, white racial and economic interests crush the hopes of blacks. Academic quotas become ceilings. Whites suppress black self-help. When black criminality is cured by pebbles, whites no longer fear blacks but they quickly find other excuses to restrict black opportunity.    Through his characters, Mr. Bell succeeds in giving a grand tour of the most sophisticated left-wing black thinking on the law and race relations. More than that, he forces his readers, especially those who are not black, to become intimate with diverse strains of black thinking. Nonetheless, one leaves the book dissatisfied.    Much of the current thinking on civil rights has been crippled by the confusion between a &quot;colorblind society&quot; and a &quot;colorblind Constitution.&quot; The Constitution, by protecting the rights of individuals, is colorblind. But a society cannot be colorblind, any more than men and women can escape their bodies. It would destroy limited government and liberal democracy to confuse the private, societal realm (including the body and skin color) and the public, political realm (including rights and laws). Obscuring the difference between public and private would allow private passions (including racial ones) to be given full vent in public life and overwhelm reason. When Founding Father James Madison spoke of the need for &quot;the reason alone, of the public . . . to control and regulate the government,&quot; and for government to control and regulate the passions, he wanted exactly what Justice John Harlan was pointing to when he endorsed a colorblind Constitution.    Thus the &quot;quest for racial justice,&quot; as opposed to justice per se, is doomed, because American justices by definition cannot be race- or group-oriented. Yet Mr. Bell's dialogues do bring home the struggle incumbent upon all races to use public reason to suppress racial passion. Keeping race out of public life in no way implies it will disappear from private or social life. But justice must focus on the rational defense of individual freedoms, including the property rights Mr. Bell is so contemptuous of. It is difficult to see how his characters' ultimate faith that the Constitution can offer &quot;salvation for all&quot; could be otherwise affirmed.    To be more explicit, black Americans must not fear to express their diversity as individual citizens and as members of society. The tragedy of the civil rights movement is that as blacks achieved the full exercise of their rights as citizens, government expanded, and blacks became an interest group in a coalition supporting expanded government.    Instead of reflecting the diversity of the black community, blacks' political views have become more homogeneous. Yet, black ambitions need not be so closely wedded to ever-expanding government. Mr. Bell's laudable goal of &quot;decolonizing black minds&quot; would require an emancipation from reliance on government and overemphasis on race and class. In my mind, uniting black Americans means giving them the security to be diverse.    This book's greatest beneficiaries would be white conservatives, who could learn much from Mr. Bell's interlocutors about the effects of their negative civil rights rhetoric on the hopes and fears of blacks. Having heard blacks' perceptions of America's contradictions, conservatives could then make an even more persuasive case for the protection of individual rights through a colorblind Constitution. With their rights so secured, black Americans could then confidently exercise their freedom to go their various paths.    ---   Mr. Thomas is chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. </TEXT></DOC>
