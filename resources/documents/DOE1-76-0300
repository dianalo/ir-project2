Within the limits of sensitivity of these assays, the presenceof activated proto-oncogenes does not appear to be a pathogenomic indicatorof cancer cells. Although a significant fraction (15-20%) of human tumorshave oncogenes capable of inducing the malignant transformation of celllines of rodent origin, there is no apparent correlation with the pathologicalparameters of the tumor. In contrast, some carcinogen-induced animalmodel tumor systems exhibit a good correlation (70-90%) between oncogeneactivation and tumor development. The discrepancy between the frequencyof transforming genes in human and carcinogen-induced animal tumors suggestthat oncogene activation may be more related to the etiology of cancerand the genetic background of the host than to the pathology of the tumor.The majority of the oncogenes detected in gene transfer experiments havebeen found to be members of the ras gene family, first identified asthe transforming principle of several strains of murine sarcoma virus.The following report summarizes the data from theirs as well as otherlaboratories pertaining to the mechanism of activation and involvementof ras oncogenes in human and carcinogen-induced animal tumors.</TEXT></DOC>
