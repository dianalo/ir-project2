ZimmermanandM;Fully embracing modem standards for the first time, IBM recently beganshipping its first V.32 modem for asynchronous and synchronous datatransmission.andM;The 7855 V.32 Modem is a 9,600-bps unit that incorporates an expanded versionof the Hayes AT command set, allowing it to communicate with non-IBM modemsand run communications software that complies with the Hayes standard.andP;  IBM'sprevious async/sync modems -- the 5841, 5842 and 5853 -- included both theolder Hayes 1200 AT command set and IBM's proprietary command set.andP;  Thecompany's line of synchronous modems includes IBM's LPDA command set.andM;&quot;The AT command set has basically become a standard for a lot of modems,&quot;said Mel Scott, programming product manager at IBM's Somers, N.Y., facility.andO;&quot;In the past, we've put both the IBM set and the AT set into one modem, butthere wasn't much demand for that.andP;  And obviously nobody else used the IBMcommand set except IBM.&quot; Scott said the company has not decided whether itwill include its command set in future products.andM;At least one market analyst was relieved to see the new modem from IBM.andO;&quot;It's about time,&quot; said Greg Szumowski, data communications analyst atInternational Data Corp., a market-research firm in Framingham, Mass.andP;  &quot;Thebarn door on V.32 has been open a long time.&quot;andM;The 7855 can reach transmission speeds of up to 19.2K bps over asynchronousconnections and up to 12K bps over synchronous lines via MNP Class 4error-correction and MNP 5 data-compression algorithms, said companyofficials.andM;The $1,350 product includes the modem with an attached power cord, RJ-45 andRJ-11 cords, a two-wire switched line cord, a four-wire leased-line cord, anda manual.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
