In the past two weeks alone, over 1,000 companyexecutives, directors or major shareholders have reported tothe Securities and Exchange Commission that they each soldmore than 10% of their company stock.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There's been a flood of selling,&quot; said David Coleman,editor of Vickers Weekly Insider Report, a Huntington, N.Y.,newsletter.   Insider sales outnumbered buys about four-to-one infilings received by the Securities and Exchange Commission inthe two weeks ended Feb. 21, according to Vickers. That'swhen the SEC processed many insider filings of Januarytrades. Typically, sellers outnumber buyers 2.2-to-one,reflecting routine sales of company stock obtained throughoptions exercises.   Many investors watch insider buying and selling for cluesto the outlook for individual companies and the overall stockmarket.   &quot;Either prices are getting way ahead of reality or{company} fundamentals are deteriorating and Wall Streetdoesn't know it yet,&quot; says Robert Gabele, president ofInvest/Net Inc., a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., company that tracksand analyzes SEC data.   It is tempting to dismiss the recent spate of insidersales simply as profit-taking at attractive prices, a&quot;temporary blip,&quot; said Mr. Coleman, &quot;but we make it out to bean early warning signal.&quot; He notes that of the 1,400 insidersreporting in the first two weeks of February whose tradeswere $100,000 or more, there were twelve times as manysellers as buyers.   The computer and biotechnology industries led with themost insider selling, but that's typical, given thatexecutives in these industries often receive company stock asa substantial portion of their compensation. More notable isthe uncommonly strong insider selling at brokerage houses,regional banks and airlines.   Three such companies at which chairmen trimmed their ownstockholdings substantially include State Street BostonCorp., Motorola Inc. and Mesa Airlines Inc., according to SECfilings.   Mr. Gabele said that insiders also are taking profits inconsumer specialty companies, office suppliers and housingcompanies.   Insider buying, on the other hand, has been scarce. Butwhat's notable is that &quot;the industries where we've seeninsider buying seem to support the cyclical recoveryscenario,&quot; said Michael Painchaud, principal of MarketProfile Theorems Inc., a Seattle financial research firm.There's been some insider nibbling at auto-parts companies,machinery companies and in oil and gas stocks.   In many cases, recent stock run-ups appeared to result inprices too tempting for insiders to resist:   -- Motorola's 52-week trading range has been $54 to $82.50a share. Nineteen insiders got out of the stock at the highend of that range in January, at prices ranging from $75.75to $79.50 a share, SEC filings show.   Motorola Chairman George M. Fisher exercised options topurchase 28,475 shares on Jan. 17 at between $31 to $43 eachand immediately resold 22,765 of them at $78.50 each, SECfilings show. He now holds 11,560 Motorola shares, includingnewly acquired stock.   Insider selling is common at the Schaumberg, Ill.,electronics giant, and many of the Motorola sales wererelated to the earlier exercise of stock options. But therecent insider selling was still above the company's normalpace. All told, the 19 insiders trimmed their holdings by256,719 shares valued at about $20 million.   The insider selling started immediately after Motorola'srelease of fourth-quarter earnings. The company said netincome rose 16% to 96 cents a share from 82 cents a yearearlier, on slightly higher sales.   A Motorola spokesman said the sales were bunched togetherbecause the company has a narrow time window during whichinsiders are allowed to sell shares. He said that the salesin total represented less than 1% of Motorola top executives'stock and stock-option ownership.   -- The shares of State Street Boston have traded betweenabout $39 and $66.25 a share in the last year, closingyesterday at $64 in over-the-counter trading. Boston-basedState Street serves as custodian for mutual funds, pensionfunds and trusts.   Since Jan. 17, State Street Chairman William S. Edgerlyhas sold 195,000 shares at prices ranging from $59.50 to$63.50 each, SEC filings show. The shares represented 83% ofhis State Street stock. Mr. Edgerly has announced he will beretiring at the end of 1992, and in December stepped down aschief executive officer of the firm.   Mr. Edgerly could not be reached for comment. State StreetBoston posted fourth-quarter net income of 73 cents a share,fully diluted, down 10% from 83 cents a share a year earlier.   -- Four officials of Mesa Airlines Inc., including thechairman, sold a total of 59,375 shares valued at about $1.2million in late December through Jan. 13.   Mesa Airlines stock has been on a steady climb from its$5-a-share level a year ago to its 52-week high of $23.50reached earlier this month. Those prices are adjusted for athree-for-two stock split effective Jan. 28. The stock closedat $22.25 in over-the-counter trading yesterday.   The largest insider sale was by Larry Risley, MesaAirlines chairman and president, who trimmed his holdings by50,000 shares, or 17% of his holdings, at a splitadjustedshare price of $14.17 a share. He retains 248,085 shares,according to SEC filings. In addition, a vice president andan officer of the company sold 3,000 and 2,250 shares,respectively, representing all of their Mesa Airlines shares,according to the company.   Mr. Risley could not be reached for comment, but BlaineJones, the company's chief financial officer, said Mr. Risley&quot;diversified his risk&quot; with the stock sale; the other saleswere related to the exercise of options, he added.</TEXT></DOC>
