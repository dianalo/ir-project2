The Party for Peace and Democracy, led by former presidentialcandidate Kim Dae-jung, said the protests were caused in part byattempts to subordinate Korean policy to U.S. interests.   The party also called on protesters to halt attacks on U.S.diplomatic offices and said it did not endorse protesters' callsfor the removal of U.S. troops from South Korea.   But the statement it released today was the party's harshestcriticism of the United States in recent months.   ``Although we understand the feelings of the students, westrongly ask them not to use violence under any circumstances,''the statement said.   Radical students have made three attacks on U.S. diplomaticposts in Seoul and the southern city of Kwangju since Thursday. Atleast five police officers and two students have been hurt in theattacks, but no U.S. personnel have been injured.   Protesters attacked the U.S. Information Service center inKwangju with firebombs late Monday. Students hurling bombs scaledthe walls of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul on Friday after an attack onthe Seoul U.S. Information Service office the day before.   National Police Headquarters in Seoul said the nation was quiettoday after clashes Monday in Kwangju, 165 miles south of Seoul.   Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jae promised action after the governingDemocratic Justice Party called today for tighter security toprotect U.S. diplomatic facilities and its own offices.   The Party for Peace and Democracy urged the government and theUnited States to study why students were protesting and take stepsto end repressive rule and other unpopular policies.   The protests, it said, were caused by ``U.S. policies thatemphasize its own national interests and the (South Korean)government's humiliating subservience toward the U.S.''   Thousands of radical students and dissidents battled riot policewith firebombs and rocks in Seoul and other cities during the pastweek in the worst political unrest since nationwide riots in thesummer of 1987.   Radical groups have called for the overthrow of President RohTae-woo and the removal of 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Koreaunder a mutual defense pact.   National police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said that students who attacked the U.S. Information center inKwangju planned to seize the building to force the U.S. ambassadorto hold a public debate in the city on the American role in a 1980uprising.   The recent riots erupted around the May 18 anniversary of theanti-government revolt. At least 191 people were killed when armyforces suppressed the uprising, and radicals claim the UnitedStates was behind the suppression.   U.S. officials have consistently denied the U.S. government hadanything to do with the Kwangju revolt. The United States hastended to push quietly for democratic reform in South Korea overthe years.</TEXT></DOC>
