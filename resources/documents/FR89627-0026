Implemented on July 1, 1988 for the United Kingdom(53 FR 24898) and on December 15, 1988 for Japan (53 FR 50160), over 800,000visitors have entered the United States under the program for ninety daysor less by arriving in the United States on one of the one hundred participatingcarriers.The designation of the six additional countries, the Federal Republic ofGermany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland was accomplishedby the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, acting jointly throughtheir designees. (See the Department of State rule published elsewherein this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>). As set by statute, the designation of the countrieswas based upon reciprocity and the low visa refusal rate during two previousfull fiscal years. In addition, consistent with the intent of the measureto promote and facilitate international travel, the volume of travel tothe United States was used in the designation process. Together, the eightcountries accounted for over 50% of the 12.4 million nonimmigrants whoentered the United States in fiscal year 1987 and of the 14.6 million infiscal year 1988. Section 217.5(a) is amended to add the additional sixcountries and effective dates of implementation for each.The Service has continued to make extensive efforts to permit interestedparties to provide comments on the progress of the program. Senior immigrationofficers were sent to the United Kingdom and Japan to provide assistanceto carriers and to travel agencies prior to and subsequent to implementation.Similar assistance will be provided in the additional six countries. Muchpublic attention has been focused on the expansion of the waiver program.This rule grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction andtherefore is being made effective less than thirty days after publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1).In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner certifies that thisrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities.
