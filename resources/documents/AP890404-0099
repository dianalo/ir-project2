The U.S. statement came as fighting continued for the fourth dayin Namibia between thousands of Soviet-backed SWAPO guerrillas andSouth African troops and local police.   ``SWAPO's intention apparently was to establish bases inNamibia, in clear violation'' of a U.S.-brokered peace agreementsigned last December. The pact, negotiated over two years byAssistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker, calls for Cuba topull its troops out of Angola and for South Africa to grantindependence to neighboring Namibia.   The agreement went into effect April 1 but was threatened by thefighting, which has claimed 180 lives, according to police figuresthat could not be independently verified.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the UnitedStates does not think the agreement is in danger of unraveling ``atthis point.''   U.S. diplomats are still in touch with the Soviet Union, Cubaand Angola, asking them to use their influence with SWAPO torestore calm in Namibia, she said. The United States, for its part,is asking South Africa to rein in its troops, who were scheduled tobegin demobilizing Sunday once the peace agreement went into effectand U.N. peacekeepers were deployed.   ``The United States position is that SWAPO must withdraw theforces it has sent into Namibia to north of the 16th parallel inAngola,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. Under the peace agreement, SWAPOguerrillas were supposed to stay in their Angolan bases, about 100miles north of the Namibian border.   She said that despite rebel claims, there was no doubt that theguerrillas had crossed the border on Saturday.   Guerrilla officials and the Angolan government claim thefighters have been in Namibia for some time and fired in selfdefense after security forces attacked them.   Villagers in northern towns, most of whom support the rebels,said they believe the guerrillas left Angola to return home and didnot expect a fight because the independence process officially hasbegun.   Asked whether the U.N. force, which has just 1,000 of itsplanned 4,650 soldiers deployed so far, should have foreseen theSWAPO incursion, Ms. Tutwiler replied that ``hindsight is alwaysgreat, but I don't think anybody anticipated this.''</TEXT></DOC>
