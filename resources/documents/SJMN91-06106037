It turns out she has been a concentration campguard, and this is her atonement.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TOO HEAVY A LOAD FOR 'TWO'DRAMATURGICAL OVERLOAD HURTS NEW PLAY BASEDON A GOOD IDEA  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Theater Review  </MEMO><TEXT>     But Australian playwright Ron Elisha keeps layering on more and morecomplexities -- she is also half-Jewish but rejected her Jewish mother, etc.-- so that Anna is less fleshed out than bloated, a walking case ofdramaturgical overload.;    In any event, after about three scenes, it's nolonger possible to tell whether the characters are real or allegorical, a pairof symbolic Survivors, though the rabbi's name is a clue: &quot;Chaim&quot; means life.;   Often heard;  Its message, that we are all kindred and all responsible,also can be seen in Athol Fugard's &quot;The Blood Knot&quot; (which closed at San JoseStage Company this weekend) and countless other plays. It's a fine, upstandingmessage, except Elisha keeps repeating it without any dramatic proof to backit up.;    What sets &quot;Two&quot; (a meaningless title) apart from &quot;The Diary of AnneFrank&quot; or &quot;The Pawnbroker,&quot; to name two seminal works of Holocaust art, isthat it takes place in 1948, against the background of the partition ofPalestine into the modern state of Israel. News bulletins from the radio keepus abreast of the United Nations negotiations and the coming war; the playends on Israel's Independence Day.;    Gray needed;  But you'd think (wouldn'tyou?) that for being written in 1984, the play might have a little moreperspective than rah-rah Zionism. For the first 30 years of Israel'sexistence, it may have been possible to see the Middle East in black and whiteterms. No longer. Israel, the Palestinians and the Arab states are equally toblame for the current mess, but its roots are back in the U.N. partition plan.Elisha alludes to it, and you sense he's groping to untangle the web ofstubbornness and racism and intolerance, but he never gets very far.;   However, the human dilemma of Anna and the rabbi is undeniable and touching.His memories of the tragedies of Auschwitz, hers of the mother she rejected,are told in powerful monologues. And the simplest effect may be the strongest:Beethoven's music, a living reminder of the healing gift of art, in a goldenoutpouring from the rabbi's radio.;    The play comes from GoldbrierProductions, the independent team of Andrew Brier and Dan Goldblatt, whobrought Vaclav Havel's &quot;Audience&quot; to Life on the Water last season. Goldblattdirected in slow motion; &quot;Two&quot; lasts only two hours in clock time, but you'reaware of every single minute of it, between the halting pace and Porter's&quot;um&quot;-peppered dialogue.;    Persoff is a little too quick for a wiped-out man,and many of his character's ripostes, supposedly funny, are just plain cruel.(Anna plays her violin, and the rabbi says: &quot;Your playing would have been agreat comfort to Beethoven.&quot;) Porter, who is blond and has a round face andheavy calves appropriate to her part, gives a clean, focused performance of arole that keeps dumping new information all over her (and us).;    DavidHoffmann's basement set is functional and well detailed, but Edith Brier'scostumes a little too neat and tidy for postwar Germany. Jim Cave's lighting,as good as usual, outdoes itself whenever the train comes by; the room shakesand the lights flash on and off, and we are back, momentarily, in a time wheninnocent people were hauled off to mass graves.;  Two; By Ron Elisha; Through:May 12; Where: Life on the Water, Fort Mason, San Francisco.; Tickets:$16-$24.
