After lagging the broad market averages for 17 consecutive quarters, the average equity mutual fund finally outperformed the market in the last quarter of 1987. But that was little consolation for fund investors: All it meant was that while the market's performance was horrendous, the record of mutual funds was merely horrible.    The performance &quot;should have cured both individual and corporate investors from any belief that there are riskless investment strategies,&quot; says A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc.    The average general equity fund tracked by Lipper Analytical fell 20.43% in the fourth quarter, barely beating the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, which registered a 22.75% loss with dividends reinvested during the three months. For the year, the average stock fund still trailed the Sandamp;P 500, gaining 0.47% compared with 4.9% for the broad market index.    Stock-fund investors learned the hard way during the quarter that professional management and portfolio diversification don't significantly guard portfolios from market risk, particularly during times of panic. Even highly touted features, such as the ability to redeem or switch shares by phone, didn't prevent losses because many funds' phone lines were clogged during the crash. &quot;The idea that you can protect yourself by switching out of a fund suffered a huge hit,&quot; says Kurt Brouwer, a San Francisco money manager.    Not all fund holders were hammered, of course. World income funds, for instance, were world-beaters for the quarter, surging 10.73%. The funds, which invest in overseas bonds, were bolstered by a weak U.S. dollar and higher bond prices since the crash. More than half the top performing funds for the quarter were in the world income category; for the year, the group rose 20.80% -- the third highest of any mutual fund sector.    And fixed-income funds -- after losing ground for much of the year amid plunging bond prices -- revived when interest rates, which had been rising, started to decline in October. The average fixed-income fund rose 3.31% in the quarter and 1.27% for the year. That still trailed the overall bond market, however, which gained 5.84% in the quarter and 2.29% for the year, as measured by the Shearson Lehman Government Corporate Bond Index.    Investors in specialized stock funds suffered the most. Small-company growth funds, after lagging the market on the way up, also were among those falling the hardest, plunging 24.75% for the quarter and nearly 6% for the year. Other narrowly focused groups, such as science and technology funds and health funds, also were battered. The worst performing fund for the quarter and full year -- 44 Wall St. Equity -- was badly hurt, for instance, by investments in technology issues. For the quarter, 44 Wall St. was down 49.32%; it declined 41.91% for the year.    Even gold-oriented funds -- the biggest winners as a group for the year overall -- took a beating in the quarter, surprising investors who had hoped they would hedge the market stumble because of bullion's allure as a safe haven. The average gold-related fund fell 21.74% for the three months, and funds heavily invested in Canadian and less liquid Australian gold shares had the biggest losses of the group. Financial Strategic Gold Portfolio, which is invested largely in Canadian and Australian stocks, fell more than a third for the quarter.    Some specialists warn that too much emphasis shouldn't be placed on quarterly rankings. Even though such rankings have helped attract billions of dollars the past five years, specialists say long-term consistency is much more important in monitoring a fund's performance record.    Still, some investors were surprised at the drastic drop in their equity funds during the quarter and have rearranged their holdings.    &quot;My funds fell a little more than I thought,&quot; says Jack Wilson, a Winchester, Mass., electronic engineer who switched about half of his $45,000 holdings in three stock funds -- Fidelity Magellan, Fidelity Growth andamp; Income, and Evergreen Total Return -- to money-market accounts. &quot;I wasn't sure what the market would do,&quot; he says, adding that Magellan, which fell nearly 25% for the quarter, didn't buffer stock losses as well as he had hoped.    A. John Ward of Englewood, Fla., says he redeemed his shares in the Brandywine Fund, a growth-oriented portfolio that fell nearly 30% for the three months. &quot;I didn't panic, but I wanted to pull back a bit,&quot; the former management-consulting executive says. Mr. Ward also plans to shift about a third of his remaining shares in five equity funds to shorter-term bond funds.    For the year, investors would have benefited from stashing their cash in gold-related funds. The average gold-related fund surged 35.66%, riding a 20% rise in gold prices. Yet, the leading gold-oriented fund benefited from investing half its portfolio in other metals. The Oppenheimer Gold andamp; Special Minerals Fund, which soared 71.59%, made much of its gains after the crash from buying copper, aluminum and steel, all of which rose more than gold for the quarter.    A new Oppenheimer fund also snared the year's top spot among all mutual funds. The Oppenheimer Ninety-Ten fund jumped 93.56%, with most of the gains coming during the crash. Only weeks before Oct. 19, portfolio manager Milton Berg invested 10% of the fund's holdings in put options on the Standard andamp; Poor's 100-index, effectively betting that the market would fall. Some specialists caution, however, that the small fund's use of options can make it volatile.    Several of the year's best stock funds sidestepped the U.S. market, looking instead to Japan. DFA Japan Small Co. Fund soared 87.76%, for instance, because Japanese small companies have outperformed all others. And GT Japan Growth, which was up 51.74%, shifted away from Japan's major exporting companies because of the strength of the yen. Instead, the fund has invested in the construction and retailing industries benefiting from the current domestic boom in Japan.    For the five years ended Dec. 31, Japan also was the place to be. Merrill Lynch Pacific Fund, although falling more than 25% for the quarter, has more than quadrupled since the end of 1982, investing heavily in Japanese property-casualty insurers.    Another big fund slumped for the three months, but still holds its long-term gains. Fidelity Magellan, the nation's largest equity fund, fell 24.73% for the quarter but remains by far the top performer for the past 10 years, with a gain of more than 1,380%.    What counts most for fund investors, however, is timing, specialists point out. Says Reg Green, editor of Mutual Fund News Service, an industry newsletter: &quot;For most people, what mattered most wasn't what they bought-but when they bought it.&quot;    ---                  Markets by the Slice                                            Total Return                                                    Full                                       Fourth       Year Fund Category                         Quarter      1987 World Income                          +10.73%     +20.80% Fixed Income                          + 3.31      + 1.27 Option growth                         + 0.76      +31.06 Income                                - 3.24      - 0.43 Utilities                             - 7.61      - 7.67 Balanced                              -10.63      + 2.56 Equity income                         -14.12      - 2.49 Convertible Secs                      -16.10      - 5.93 Option income                         -16.90      - 1.18 International                         -17.43      +13.95 Growth and Income                     -18.09      + 1.51 Global                                -19.14      + 5.60 Cap appreciation                      -21.38      + 1.53 Specialty                             -21.46      - 3.76 Growth                                -21.68      + 1.10 Gold                                  -21.74      +35.66 Natural resources                     -23.94      + 4.85 Small Co. growth                      -24.75      - 5.92 Health                                -25.56      - 2.65 Science and technology                -25.71      + 2.18 Average general equity funds          -20.43%     + 0.47% Average for all equity funds          -20.24%     + 2.29% Standard andamp; Poor's   500-index reinvested                -22.75%     + 4.94% Source: Lipper Analytical Services Inc.   ---   Money Market Assets Rise   NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's money market funds increased $5.64 billion to $263.88 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade association, said.   &quot;The gain in total assets primarily reflects the actions of institutional investors,&quot; according to Alfred P. Johnson, vice president and chief economist at the institute. &quot;This group added to their holdings of money funds in response to seasonal forces and the funds' yield advantage over short-term securities.&quot;   Assets of 206 general-purpose funds decreased $117 million to $79.27 billion. The assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $1.43 billion to $109.3 billion, while assets of 112 institutional funds increased $4.32 billion to $75.31 billion.   The average seven-day yield for funds, in the week ended Tuesday, rose to 6.8% from 6.69% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. The average 30-day yield for funds rose to 6.65% from 6.57%, and the average maturity of funds shortened to 35 days from 36 days.   Banks, which compete with money funds, were paying an average yield of 5.61% on money market savings accounts in the week ended Wednesday, unchanged from the week before, according to Banxquote Online, a New York-based information service. Bank yields were 6.88% on six-month savings certificates of deposit, compared with 6.92% the previous week, and were 7.23% for one-year bank savings CDs, unchanged from the previous week.</TEXT></DOC>
