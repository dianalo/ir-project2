For the time being, the New York Fed said, it will use direct lines to brokers only to gather market information, and it will continue to deal only with banks in foreign exchange transactions. But a Fed official raised the possibility of eventually using brokers in its currency-market intervention activities.    The Fed conducts the U.S. government's foreign exchange trading and market intervention.    In the meantime, the extension of private lines to currency brokers lifts the hopes of several large investment banks that seek similar access. &quot;It's a step in the right direction,&quot; an investment banker said of the move.    A Fed spokesman said Friday that extending lines to investment banks is still under consideration.    Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. are among the investment banks that have become major foreign exchange market participants in recent years and seek lines to the Fed.    The Fed wouldn't say which or how many brokers it established links with, but two New York brokers identified themselves as having opened lines to the Fed: Noonan, Astley andamp; Pearce Inc. and Tullett andamp; Tokyo Forex Inc.    For the Fed, lines to brokers provide instantaneous information on exchange-rate moves. For brokers, as for commercial banks, getting a line to the Fed brings prestige and at least the appearance of having access to the internal workings of the often secretive central bank.    If the Fed eventually chooses to use brokers for its currency transactions, the lines also could deliver sizable chunks of profitable business.    &quot;The Federal Reserve is the cream of cream,&quot; Richard W. Magee, managing director at Tullett andamp; Tokyo, said. &quot;They don't use brokers at the moment, but I suspect they may down the road.&quot;    Through a spokesman, Margaret L. Greene, the Fed's senior vice president of foreign exchange, said the central bank is &quot;reserving judgment&quot; on &quot;whether in the future we will deal with brokers.&quot;    Other central banks use brokers in foreign-exchange market intervention, including the Bank of Japan, West German Bundesbank and the Bank of England, according to traders.    Unlike commercial and investment banks, brokers don't trade currencies for their own accounts but act as intermediaries between market participants in return for commissions.    And as with investment banks, brokers are playing a rapidly growing role in currency trading. In a 1986 survey by the Fed, the nine brokers that participated were parties in one-third of all foreign exchange transactions by commercial and investment banks. The brokers' combined average daily trading volume was $25.9 billion, a rise of 84% since 1983.    Brokers had been seeking lines to the Fed since the 1970s, according to Joe Roderick, vice president at Noonan Astley.    The Fed hasn't discussed its deliberations about granting lines to investment banks. But it was believed to be concerned about whether it could deal with entities beyond its regulatory control and about possibly further blurring the boundary between commercial and investment banking.    Securities firms, however, say that by excluding them, the Fed limits its access to an increasingly important market segment with first-hand knowledge of the international capital flows that play a big part in exchange-rate swings.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar rose in foreign exchange trading, partly on news of last month's Japanese trade surplus for June and indications of lower U.S. inflation.    However, the dollar failed to definitively break through a resistance level against the West German mark because of rumors about intervention by that nation's central bank.    In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.8461 marks, compared with 1.8389 late Thursday, and at 150.80 Japanese yen, compared with 150.18.    In active Tokyo trading, the dollar rose above 151 yen after the Finance Ministry reported that Japan had an unadjusted trade surplus of $6.61 billion in June, narrowed from $7.36 billion a year earlier but slightly wider than May's $6.41 billion.    U.S. traders were watching the Japanese numbers as well, especially in light of Wednesday's scheduled release of U.S. merchandise trade figures for May.    After showing little movement in Europe, the dollar was bid up slightly in New York on news of a smaller-than-expected gain of 0.2% in the June U.S. producer price index, which is viewed as an inflation indicator. The June figure followed a 0.7% rise in May.    Some traders played down rumors that the West German central bank was selling small amounts of dollars in the Frankfurt market. Rumors that couldn't be independently confirmed said the central bank wasn't intervening to stem the mark's recent rise but mainly to slow growth of the West German money supply.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 60 cents an ounce to $444.30 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 2.9 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $442.25 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Friday, July 10, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
