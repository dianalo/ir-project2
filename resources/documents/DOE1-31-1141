Sewage effluent is used in several Swedish cities asa heat source in heat pump assisted district heating systems. The treamentfacility is located adjacent to downtown and the new effluent transferpipline will run through the port district in route to the CommencementBay. Other potential heat sources are the proposed biomass cogenerationplant and Simpson Tacoma Kraft Pulp and Paper Mill. The pulp mill isalso adjacent to downtown, however, the proposed cogeneration plant willbe about a mile away. A preliminary district heating analysis was performedusing a computer analysis tool called HEATPLAN. The analysis was favorableand a decision to move ahead with further study was made by WSEO.</TEXT></DOC>
