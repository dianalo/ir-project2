According to people familiar with the $4.38 billionbuy-out effort, the airline holding company's board approvedsuspension of the long-running talks under pressure frommembers of the buy-out team.</LP><TEXT>   The buy-out group is seeking to use preferred-supplierstatus as a carrot to entice financial backing from the likesof plane manufacturers Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie andengine maker General Electric Co.   The unions are said to have argued that a UAL jet order atthis time would have undercut their talks with suppliers.Gerald Greenwald, the former Chrysler Corp. vice chairman nowheading the UAL buy-out effort, made the argument in a recentletter to UAL's board, according to a person familiar withthe buy-out.   In an internal memo issued yesterday to employees, thecompany said its action is &quot;an effort to be as accommodatingas possible&quot; to the buy-out team. Board members discussed theaction in telephone interviews Monday and Tuesday; a companyspokesman declined to comment.   A spokesman for the buy-out group, United EmployeeAcquisition Corp., said for UAL to place the order &quot;at thispoint limits options&quot; suppliers might be considering. &quot;Theissue here is to give suppliers time to examine the means bywhich to include financing in their aircraft bids,&quot; he said.   For weeks, industry observers had been waiting for UAL'sUnited Airlines unit to announce its record order for as manyas 150 jetliners. United was negotiating with Boeing, AirbusIndustrie and McDonnell Douglas Corp. for the planes,industry sources said.   At the same time, members of the buy-out group have metwith airlines and suppliers in the U.S. and Europe, seekingsupport for their financing efforts. The potential investorsare believed to have included Boeing, Airbus Industrie,General Electric, Rolls-Royce PLC, British Airways PLC andGuinness Peat Aviation, a leasing firm.   While Boeing wouldn't comment on the state of what aspokesman calls &quot;intense&quot; talks with United about its fleetneeds, any United-Boeing deal would have the potential to bea landmark for the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer.   Boeing counts United among its strongest customershistorically. And United is considered a prime candidate toplace one of the several big orders Boeing would need tolaunch its proposed 767-X airliner, a 350-seat plane designedto compete with Airbus A-330s and A-340s and McDonnellDouglas MD-11s that are much farther along in the developmentprocess. The 767X would be designated the 777 when Boeingformally launches the plane.   The Boeing spokesman confirmed that the 767-X and thecompany's highest-priced product, the four-engine 747-400,have been involved in the negotiations with United.   Boeing's order-taking this year, while strong, has beenlagging behind last year's record clip. More than $32 billionof Boeing planes were ordered in the 1989 first half. Unitedplaced orders for narrow-bodied Boeing 737s and 757s in April1989 in a $7 billion transaction, potentially worth more thantwice that amount if all options are exercised. At the time,UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said that order, as well as theorder now delayed, were designed to stop United's &quot;erosion ofmarket share and put us back in a vigorous growth mode.&quot;   In 1987, Boeing's close relationship with United took on anew dimension when terms of the sale of 11 Boeing 747-400scalled for Boeing to acquire $700 million of notes issued byUnited's parent company. That seller-financing arrangementwas widely seen as a way for Boeing to help United fend off ahostile takeover.   A spokeswoman for the Douglas Aircraft unit of St.Louis-based McDonnell Douglas wouldn't comment on United'sdecision to delay talks. She added that United currentlyoperates DC-10s, and has been discussing the possiblepurchase of 350-seat MD-11s as replacements. McDonnellDouglas expects to deliver the first of the new MD-11s toairline customers in the fourth quarter.   An Airbus spokesman, saying the United decision reflects&quot;a very dynamic situation&quot; at the airline, said that hiscompany &quot;will be back there at the table when the opportunitypresents itself again.&quot; Airbus &quot;remains enthusiastic&quot; aboutthe prospect of selling United a mix of 295-seat A-340s and335-seat A-330s, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
