However, the department also announced its intention toverify the data on which it based its initial finding and toask for further information from the concerned parties. Thedepartment was acting on a complaint brought by Lasko MetalProducts Inc., West Chester, Pa.</LP><TEXT>   Peter Feller, a lawyer for the petitioner, said thedepartment reached a negative finding because it is still&quot;struggling&quot; with the question of how to treat socialistcountries in transition toward a market economy. Lasko claimsthat the Chinese manufacturers are unfairly subsidized, butwhether relief in the form of countervailing duties, whichwould compensate for the subsidies, is granted depends on howthe U.S. regards the nature of some of their financing.   The department said the imports of these Chinese fansamounted to $140 million in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
