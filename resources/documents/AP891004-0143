During an hour-long hearing, the justices showed littleinclination to restore the victory it took Olaf and Mary Hallstromthree years and $95,000 to win.   ``Your case is an appealing one,'' Justice Antonin Scalia toldthe Hallstroms' lawyer but noted that asking the court to interpreta federal law contrary to its clear language is risky business.   The Hallstroms' victory was overturned because their lawyer hadfailed to notify federal and state environmental officials, asrequired by the law under which they sued, before filing the 1982suit.   That lawyer, Kim Buckley of Portland, urged the justicesWednesday to ``look at the spirit'' of the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act, one of at least a dozen federal environmentallaws that gives private citizens the right to sue for enforcement.   At issue is a narrow, but potentially significant, point ofenvironmental law _ one that may affect the success of privatecitizen enforcement.   The Hallstroms' suit contended that a county landfill adjacentto what's left of their 200-acre dairy farm caused or contributedto the pollution of their water supply.   The couple's lawyer informed the county of their intention tosue well before the 60-day period required by the federal law. ButBuckley did not give the same required notification to the federalEnvironmental Protection Agency or the Oregon Department ofEnvironmental Quality.   A federal judge, however, allowed the lawsuit to proceed and in1985 ordered the county to remedy federal environmental lawviolations within two years.   The judge turned down the Hallstroms' request for $95,000 inattorney fees, and the couple appealed.   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1987 ruled that theHallstroms' suit should have been dismissed before any trialbecause of the failure to notify.   That left the Hallstroms at square one _ with the option offiling a new lawsuit.   ``It's just not fair'' to make the Hallstroms ``jump through ajudicial hoop that has no purpose,'' Buckley told the nation'shighest court.   He argued that reinstating the Hallstroms' victory ``wouldeffectuate the will of Congress'' to protect the environment.   But several justices voiced concern over straying from theclearly worded notification requirement that Congress included inthe law.   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy spoke about the need for ``a rulethat everyone can understand.''   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, while noting that interpreting thelaw as written ``results in an unfortunate situation in thiscase,'' said the law ``is workable as written.''   The court was urged by I. Franklin Hunsaker, a Portland lawyerrepresenting the county, to uphold the circuit court's ruling sogovernment agencies can assess environmental messes before lawsuitsare filed over them.   Hunsaker said treating the 60-day notice provision as mandatoryassures ``predictability and even-handedness in the administrationof this law.''   Bush administration lawyer Brian J. Martin said the EPA agreedthat ``dismissal (of the Hallstroms' suit) is required.''   A Supreme Court decision is expected by July.   The case is Hallstrom vs. Tillamook County, 88-42.</TEXT></DOC>
