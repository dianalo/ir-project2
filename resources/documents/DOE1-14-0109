Spheroids is stirred media equilibrated with air on5% O/sub 2/ containing 4 different glucose concentrations exhibited markedlydifferent P/sub O2/ profiles. O/sub 2/ and glucose supply conditionsduring spheroid growth influenced the number of viable and respiringcells as well as the respiration rate of the cells in the spheroids asrevealed by histological investigations, measurements of consumption,and theoretical considerations. In general, lowering of the glucose concentrationwas associated with a decrease in viable rim thickness and an increasein cellular respiration rate. O/sub 2/ and glucose consumption in spheroidsdecreased with increasing spheroid size under most of the growth conditionsinvestigated.</TEXT></DOC>
