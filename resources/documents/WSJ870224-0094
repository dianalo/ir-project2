Last week the U.S. ended the last remaining sanctions against the Jaruzelski regime, yet the president's goals remain unfulfilled.    The lifting of martial law and the freeing of most political prisoners is perhaps a lessening of political repression but is not its end. State-church relations are less strained today than they were five or six years ago, yet most of the flexibility has come from the church. That sort of one-sidedness is not the most desirable form of dialogue. The most notable failing, though, is the Polish regime's total rigidity on Solidarity.    Gen. Jaruzelski, in Leninist fashion, deems the union not just an outlaw but a &quot;nonentity&quot; and Lech Walesa a &quot;private person.&quot; For these reasons, at least, we don't think the U.S. got the best possible bargain on behalf of the people of Poland when last week it restored most-favored-nation tariff status and reopened the way for more federally guaranteed credits. Richard T. Davies, a retired career foreign-service officer who served as the U.S. ambassador to Poland from 1974 to 1978, says the U.S. should have pressured Warsaw to enact economic reforms as a quid pro quo for dropping sanctions. It could, and should, have also pressed for the recognition of the principle of trade-union pluralism, which would cover Solidarity without necessarily mentioning it by name.    The organization unquestionably has broad support among Poles. Solidarity says that about half of its 9.5 million-strong pre-1982 membership (the Polish work force is 13 million) still supports it materially. One million even flout the law by paying regular dues. The union's backers abroad include the AFL-CIO in the U.S., as well as various individuals and other organizations. Last November Solidarity affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the World Confederation of Labor, both based in Brussels.    Though some within Solidarity believe that the U.S. should have continued its sanctions to demonstrate its support for the Polish worker and not the government, the union's leaders think some good can come from the move. Ending sanctions may force the Jaruzelski regime to face up to its serious economic problems rather than always blame U.S. sanctions, which it has claimed cost its economy as much as $15 billion. Actually, Polish exports to the U.S. declined from $401 million in 1981 to $248 million in 1985. What is hurting the Polish worker is the centrally mismanaged economy.    Installments on its $34 billion foreign debt outpace its hard-currency earnings 2-to-1. An acute housing shortage is forcing several million young men and women into &quot;hidden homelessness,&quot; living with parents or relatives while waiting on a 20-year list for an apartment.    Such deterioration in living standards won't be reversed until Poland brings about a market-oriented reform of its economy and liberalization of its political system. The two go hand-in-hand. As a Solidarity leader notes: &quot;When bread is lacking, give the people more freedom. They will find a way to provide.&quot;    Western creditors, politicians, organizations and individuals dealing with Poland should keep the people of that country foremost in mind. While credits for specific projects, firmly controlled by the Western creditors, may do some good, money given without strings to authorities is certain to be misused or wasted. Most important, official visitors to the country should make it a point not to slight Solidarity leaders. In post-sanctions Poland, Solidarity will need and deserves the material and moral support of the West. </TEXT></DOC>
