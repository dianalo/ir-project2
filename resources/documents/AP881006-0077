(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker says he's diggingin for a long battle to reclaim the television ministry and thathe's not deterred by a Canadian businessman who has signed acontract to buy PTL's assets.   Bakker, whose own proposal to buy back the television ministryfell through, said many obstacles remain for Stephen Mernick ofToronto, who wants to purchase the ministry's assets for $115million.   ``I look towards the long haul, I'm not in this for a shortterm. Maybe it'll be another year before we restore (PTL), maybe itwill be two years,'' said Bakker, who left in March 1987 amid asex-and-money scandal.   PTL's court-appointed trustee, M.C. ``Red'' Benton, announcedTuesday he had signed a contract with Mernick. Benton hadidentified other potential buyers but had not previously gone tothe contract stage.   PTL has been in bankruptcy reorganization since June 1987 andmust sell its assets to pay creditors as soon as possible under anorder from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds. Reynolds mustapprove any sale, and is expected to hold a hearing in about amonth on Mernick's bid.   ``There are so many obstacles that no way could I even thinkabout all of the ramifications of all this until I hear the finalgavel of the judge,'' Bakker said Wednesday.   ``It's not over till it's over, as I've been saying,'' he saidin front of the new Jim and Tammy Information Office about twomiles south of the Christian theme park, Heritage USA. ``It seemsevery few weeks we go through it's been sold again, and soldagain,'' he said, referring to other deals that collapsed.   Attorney Joseph Kluttz, representing Mernick, said Mernick willpay $50 million at closing for the deal and pay the $65 millionbalance over five years.   Mernick, an Orthodox Jew, has not said what he plans to do withPTL or Heritage USA but that he would consider retaining itsChristian theme.   Benton has said other bidders may still present offers directlyto the bankruptcy court, but he said his recommendation givesMernick's offer a strong upper hand.   Bakker had proposed a $172 million plan to buy the ministry'sassets, but his bid lost credibility last month when he could notcome up with a $3 million downpayment.   Bakker said he was skeptical about Mernick's chances of makingPTL profitable again.   ``There's a thousand-room hotel there; I don't know how they'regoing to fill it, I don't know how anyone without nationaltelelvison experience could fill it,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
