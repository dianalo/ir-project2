<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-38-1474 </DOCNO><TEXT>A simple type of liquid state model is proposed to describe on a primitivelevel the melt of an elemental group IV semiconductor as a mixture ofatoms and bond particles. The latter, on increase of a coupling strengthparameter becomes increasingly localized between pairs of atoms up tolocal tetrahedral coordination of atoms by bond particles. Angular interatomiccorrelations are built into the model as bond particle localization grows,even though the bare interactions between the components of the liquidare formally described solely in terms of central pair potentials. Themodel is solved for liquid structure by standard integral equation techniquesof liquid state theory and by Monte Carlo simulation, for values of theparameters which are appropriate to liquid germanium down to stronglysupercooled states. The calculated liquid structure is compared withthe results of diffraction experiments on liquid germanium near freezingand discussed in relation to diffraction data on amorphous germanium.The model suggests simple melting criteria for elemental and polar semiconductors,which are empirically verified.
