He istrying to mediate the dispute.   In May, Bulgaria began deporting ethnic Turks in the wake of agovernment campaign that forced them to adopt Slavic names,restricted their Moslem rites and banned use of the Turkishlanguage. There are more than 1 million ethnic Turks in Bulgaria.   Turkey has mobilized a huge effort to absorb the refugees,housing thousands in tent camps and pressuring private employers togive them jobs, despite a nationwide unemployment rate of 16percent.   Earlier this week, Britain made a gesture to help Turkey, a NATOally, by giving $492,000 to ethnic Turks and Kurdish refugees fromIraq.   The Turkish Foreign Ministry said Wednesday the influx hadreached 202,000 and showed no signs of slackening. Thousands havepoured in day and night on foot as well as in cars and train. Somewho walked across the border pulled carts with their possessions.   Among those arriving Wednesday was a world championweightlifter, Erdinc Kasimoglu, the Anatolia news agency reported.   A Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said Turkey believed the dispute would not be solvedeasily, even with the ambassador's help.   ``He is mediating, but so far there is no change in theBulgarian position, and we are unlikely to change ours,'' theofficial said.   Turkey is demanding that negotiations include an immigrationagreement to protect the legal rights of the ethnic Turks, such asaccumulated social security benefits and compensation for propertyleft behind. It also calls for restoration of minority rights forthose who choose to remain in Bulgaria.   Bulgaria has been insisting on an open agenda.   The Turks, however, say an open agenda would allow talks to dragon and detract world attention from the urgent problem.   The Soviet Union, Turkey's northern neighbor, has been beset byits own ethnic problems. It also has a large ethnic Turkishpopulation.</TEXT></DOC>
