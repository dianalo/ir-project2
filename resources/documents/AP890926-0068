(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hurricane Hugo knocked out electricityand phones at Heritage USA, hastening the closing of much of theChristian theme park and retreat built by Jim Bakker.   ``We were planning to close the hotel anyhow. It was a cashdrain,'' M.C. Benton, the bankruptcy trustee overseeing theproperty, said Monday.   The 11-year-old, 2,200-acre park was shut down Friday afterHugo's assault. The Heritage Grand Hotel, full of charismaticChristians and curiosity-seekers before Bakker's downfall in a sexand money scandal, had been nearly empty in recent months.   Bakker resigned from the ministry in 1987 and PTL filed forbankruptcy. Bakker is on trial in Charlotte, N.C., on charges ofdefrauding followers by diverting nearly $4 million in donations tolive in high style.   Prosecutors said he oversold ``lifetime partnerships''guaranteeing major contributors lodging at the Heritage Grand.   Heritage USA in its heyday drew millions of believers. Inaddition to Jim and Tammy Bakker, the attractions included theornate hotel, a water park, shops, a TV studio and church andresidential areas.   Only the residential areas _ condominiums, houses and apartments_ remain open.   Toronto businessman Stephen Mernick last week said he hadwithdrawn his offer of $65 million for Heritage USA.   He won court approval in December to buy the park but could notget the title insurance needed to close the deal because of a claimto the land from an Indian tribe.   ``There are still a few interested players yet,'' Benton said.``I've gotten no written bid, but there has been expression ofinterest.''</TEXT></DOC>
