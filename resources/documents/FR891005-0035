Notices of Proposed Rule Making in the above entitled proceedings (54FR 28690, July 7, 1989); FCC 89-154, FCC 89-155 and FCC 89-156, respectively,were adopted by the Commission on May 12, 1989, and released on June 29,1989. Comments and reply comments in these proceedings originally due onAugust 21, 1989, and September 5, 1989, respectively, were extended byCommission Order to September 25, 1989 and October 30, 1989, respectively.2. On September 18, 1989 American Telephone and Telegraph Company (ATandamp;T)filed with the Commission a petition requesting a further extension ofthe time for filing comments in these proceedings from September 25, 1989to October 9, 1989 and the time for filing reply comments from October30, 1989 to December 11, 1989. The petitioner states that although thetest procedures proposed in these proceedings are somewhat similar to TP-5,which was the subject of an earlier proceeding, there are differences notonly between TP-5 and the proposed test procedures but also between theproposed test procedures themselves. They express the opinion that moretime is needed to sort out these differences and to prepare responses tothe expected voluminous reply comments. 3. The Commission recognizes the complexity and interrelated nature ofthese proceedings, and values the contributions of the petitioner and othersin the development of the subject test procedures. Because of our desireto have a fully developed record before us, it has been determined thatan extension of the comment and reply comment dates in each of these proceedingsis warranted. However, due to our desire to resolve these proceedings assoon as possible and because a previous extension has already been granted,we feel that extending the reply comment period as requested will unnecessarilyprolong these proceedings. We believe that the concerns of all interestedparties can still be resolved by extending the reply comment period toNovember 13, 1989 instead of the requested December 11, 1989. 4. Accordingly, it is ordered, pursuant to the delegated authority containedin 47 CFR 0.241(a)(5) that the period of time for the filing of commentsin the above proceedings is extended until October 9, 1989, and the timefor the filing of reply comments is extended until November 13, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas P.
