Officials in Saudi Arabia, the Arab world's richest nation, willnot discuss their intentions openly but King Fahd met with YuliVorontsov, the Soviet deputy foreign minister, on Dec. 5.   It was the highest-level contact since Josef Stalin's governmentbroke relations in 1938, after having been the first to recognizewhat was called the kingdom of the Hijaz 12 years earlier.   The Dec. 5 meeting climaxed two years of political courtship bySoviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev as part of an effort to increaseSoviet influence in the Persian Gulf region, which contains nearly60 percent of the world's proven oil reserves.   Resuming relations with Saudi Arabia, the non-communist world'sleading oil exporter and a U.S. ally of long standing, would be atriumph for Gorbachev.   Before seeing Fahd, Voronstov met with Moslem Afghan guerrillas,under Saudi sponsorship, in the Taif Mountain resort.   Saudi leaders have insisted the Soviets end their 9-year-oldmilitary involvement in Afghanistan as a condition for resumingrelations. The Red Army began withdrawing May 15 under aU.N.-mediated agreement.   Knowledgeable sources in Riyadh said the main Soviet reason formeeting Afghan insurgent leaders in Taif was to please the Saudis.   The official Saudi Press Agency quoted Vorontsov as telling Fahd,``The Soviet Union is determined to withdraw its forces fromAfghanistan at the time already fixed or perhaps earlier.''   A Western diplomat said privately: ``If the withdrawal iscompleted in February, it seems they're likely to resume relations.''   By terms of the withdrawal agreement signed April 14 in Geneva,half the Soviet Union's more than 100,000 soldiers were withdrawnfrom Afghanistan by Aug. 15 and the rest must be out by Feb. 15.   Saudi Arabia has been among the staunchest supporters of theMoslem insurgents, who began fighting after a communist coup inApril 1978.   Other Western and Arab diplomats believe the Saudis are morelikely to establish diplomatic ties with China, which has soldRiyadh intermediate-range ballistic missiles, before resumingrelations with Moscow.   Frank Carlucci, the departing U.S. defense secretary, recentlypaid a last visit to Saudi Arabia. Reports said he asked Fahd if theTaif meetings meant relations with Moscow were imminent and was toldthe matters were not related.   An Arab diplomat, also speaking privately, said: ``It's now aquestion of the right price. China may have paid with the missilesand with the Soviets it might well be a complete withdrawal fromAfghanistan.''   Prince Salman, Fahd's brother and governor of Riyadh, said: ``TheSaudi-Soviet dialogue has never been suspended despite the rupturein diplomatic ties between the countries.''   Al-Anbaa, a Kuwaiti newspaper, quoted the Soviet ambassador tothe emirate, Ernest Zverev, as saying efforts were under way ``tonormalize relations,'' but ``so far we haven't received an officialgesture from Saudi Arabia concerning diplomatic representation.''   For more than four decades after Stalin ended formal relations,theocratic Saudi Arabia shunned diplomatic ties with communistgovernments.   Saudi officials resumed contacts with the communist world in theearly 1980s to discuss the Palestinian question and the arms embargoKing Fahd's government sought to impose on Iran in the Iran-Iraq war.   Prince Saud al-Faisal, the foreign minister, visited Moscow in1982 and again in 1988. Oil Minister Hisham Nazer went there thisyear, and the Soviets have become major purchasers of Saudi wheat.   Vladimir Polyakov, Soviet undersecretary for Middle East affairs,held ``cooperation talks'' with senior Saudis in Riyadh in February.Arab diplomats said Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze willvisit the Saudi capital next month.   The United States remains a major arms supplier for Arab nationsin the Persian Gulf, but congressional blocking of advanced weaponsales has forced them to look to the Soviets, French and British.   Kuwait established relations with Moscow nearly 30 years ago, in1960, and the United Arab Emirates and Qatar did so more recently.Those conservative governments also have relations with China.
