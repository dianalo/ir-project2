Plans to ExpandIts Universal Studios Tour</HL><DD> 03/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MCA WNEWS </IN><DATELINE> UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   MCA Inc. said it will expand its 23-year-old Universal Studios Tour to include four new live-action attractions based on its films and television shows.    Sidney Sheinberg, MCA president, said the company doesn't yet have a budget for the expansion, but he indicated that it probably will exceed $75 million. In 1986, the tour contributed $84.5 million to MCA's $2.44 billion in revenue.    MCA's action follows an announcement made by Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner that Disney is considering building a studio tour in Burbank, Calif., just a few miles from Universal Studios. Disney is currently building a similar attraction at its entertainment complex near Orlando, Fla. In December, MCA formed a joint venture with Cineplex Odeon Corp. to build its own studio and theme park in Orlando.    Asked whether MCA decided to upgrade its California tour because of the rivalry with Disney, Mr. Sheinberg said: &quot;We've been considering this for a long time. But Michael Eisner convinced us of the wisdom of it.&quot;    The new attractions to be added to the Universal Studios Tour will be based on the movies &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future,&quot; the television show &quot;Miami Vice,&quot; and a planned sequel to the 1974 film &quot;Earthquake,&quot; called &quot;Earthquake-San Francisco,&quot; MCA said.    Separately, MCA said that former Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr. resigned as a director upon accepting the position of chief of staff to President Reagan last week. </TEXT></DOC>
