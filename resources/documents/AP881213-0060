Police said atleast one militiaman was killed.   The violence came one day after kidnappers holding U.S. MarineLt. Col. William R. Higgins announced that they had decided to puthim to death for allegedly spying for Israel.   Police said one combatant was killed and three pedestrians werewounded in the fighting between the Syrian-backed Amal militia andthe pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.   The battles went on for two hours in the streets of the Chiyahand Hay Madi districts before Syrian troops in charge of security inBeirut's Moslem sector moved in to stop them.   Many of the 15 hostages in Lebanon are believed held in Hay Madi,Hezbollah's main stronghold in south Beirut. Hezbollah is believedto be an umbrella for pro-Iranian extremists holding the foreigners.   Amal and Hezbollah have long been vying for dominance of the 1million Shiites in Lebanon. They clashed in a six-day battle in westand south Beirut two weeks ago. Police reported 40 people killed and87 wounded in that confrontation.   ``There was no way at the time and today (Tuesday) to ascertainwhether the hostages have been affected by the fighting,'' said apolice spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations.   Higgins' kidnappers call themselves the Organization of theOppressed on Earth, which is sponsored publicly by Hezbollah.   ``We have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute thisAmerican spy,'' the group said in a statement released in Beirut onMonday night.   ``The spy has been turned over to those responsible for executingthis just and revolutionary verdict,'' said the 15-line Arabicstatement that was delivered to the Beirut newspaper An-Nahar. Itset no date for Higgins' death.   A photocopy of a picture of Higgins was pasted to the bottom ofthe typewritten statement. Kidnappers often use photographs toauthenticate their statements.   The picture, the second of Higgins released in 10 months,resembled an photograph released April 21. It showed the balding manstoop-shouldered with his eyes downcast away from the camera. He hada gray stubble and was wearing a dark field jacket.   ``It has been proven by clearcut evidence that he (Higgins) andhis American team of observers are guilty of providing the Zionistenemy with accurate and detailed military information about ourresistance fighters,'' the statement said.   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was kidnapped Feb. 17. He headed a76-man observer team attached to the U.N. peacekeeping force insouth Lebanon.   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar was quoted by theLebanese media as appealing to Higgins' captors to spare his life.   Eight other Americans are held in Lebanon. The hostage heldlongest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
