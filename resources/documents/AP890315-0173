Peggy Say said she fears prospects for her brother's release haveworsened because his captors, pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists,are angry about the publication of Salman Rushdie's novel ``TheSatanic Verses,'' which they consider blasphemous.   ``Every event that takes place in the Middle East has thepotential effect. Hostages have died. Hostages have been executed.So when things happen, the families are in an immediate panic,''said Mrs. Say.   She and the Rev. Lawrence M. Jenco, a hostage who was released in1986, were interviewed on Cable News Network's Los Angeles-basedtalk show ``Sonya.'' It was part of a series of appearances leadingup to Thursday's four-year anniversary of the day Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press, was kidnapped inBeirut.   Anderson is the longest held of the 15 foreign hostages inLebanon. Nine are American.   ``If this were a hundred Americans, would we be here on yourprogram today four years later debating what is the right thing todo for these people?'' Mrs. Say asked. ``If we ignore nine today,what will we ignore tomorrow? Will we then ignore 19 or 90? Some dayare we going to wake up and say, `My God, what's happened to ourworld?'''   She said the ``right thing'' was for the Bush administration toopen a dialogue with Iran and to seek reconciliation.   A key element for the Americans' release would be a decision bythe United States to unfreeze Iranian assets it holds from armssales to the deposed shah, said Jenco.   Mrs. Say said she believed her brother has been held hostage thelongest because he is a journalist.   ``They counted on the fact that he is a journalist, that thewhole journalistic community would rise up in his defense as it hasfor so many others,'' she said. ``They have never understood as Iguess I have never understood nor has Terry why that hasn'thappened.''   Jenco said the United States should set an example for parts ofthe world that don't understand America's ``framework of freedom.''   ``In my own heart I believe that we should reflect to the world akinder, gentler nation, hoping that the world itself will become akinder, gentler world,'' the Roman Catholic priest said.</TEXT></DOC>
