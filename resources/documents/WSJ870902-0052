The yield on the Treasury's benchmark long-term bond surged above 9.25%, its highest level since the first week of February 1986, according to the Ryan Financial Strategy Group. Prices of most corporate and municipal bonds also slumped.    Traders said the declines accelerated late yesterday as the dollar slipped below 141.50 Japanese yen. &quot;It felt like a free-fall after that,&quot; said W. Thomas Small, a managing director at Bankers Trust Co. &quot;One might have thought current yields now are somewhat attractive. But the bond market is a crapshoot based on psychology, and people are scared. There's too much fear the dollar will keep falling.&quot;    Mr. Namberg, who also is president of Massachusetts International Trust/Bond Fund, said, &quot;The negative psychology in the bond market is making things much worse than they really are.&quot; Nevertheless, the West German bond market remains his favorite, followed by the Australian and New Zealand dollar bond markets.    &quot;For currency appreciation and yield, these seem to be the best performance candidates,&quot; he said. &quot;Until we see substantial improvement in what have been very disappointing trade deficit figures, the dollar could fall sharply again,&quot; he added.    Mickey Levy, chief economist at Fidelity Bank, Philadelphia, agreed. &quot;The dollar could easily break through its lowest level this year against the Japanese yen and West German mark,&quot; he said. The lower dollar, he contended, will &quot;elicit a tighter credit policy by the Federal Reserve&quot; and higher interest rates. Within the next two months, commercial banks' prime lending rate will rise to 8 1/2% as the Fed raises its discount rate, the fee it charges banks and other financial institutions, to 6% from 5 1/2%, he predicted.    Mr. Levy said the lower exchange rate for the dollar is necessary to stem the growth of foreign holdings of U.S. debt obligations reflected by the large U.S. current account deficit.    Whatever the case, expectations of higher interest rates in the weeks ahead prompted some large borrowers to accelerate pending financings yesterday. For example, the Community Program Loan Trust issued $1.8 billion of bonds collateralized by loans purchased from the Farmers Home Administration &quot;because there is a risk that bond yields will go even higher this week,&quot; said an investment banker involved in the underwriting syndicate. The Farmers Home Administration is an agency within the Department of Agriculture.    Underwriters led by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. priced the taxable securities at yields ranging from 8.77% for bonds with 3.7-year average maturities to 10.3% for bonds with 20.47-year average maturities. The yields amounted to premiums over similar maturing Treasury bonds ranging from 0.48 percentage point to 1.05 percentage points. The issue, which includes five separate fixed-rate securities offerings, is rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    The offering represents the first federal loan asset sale under the Reagan administration's credit management initiative. The program authorizes several federal agencies to sell loan assets to private investors, without federal guarantees behind the debt.    The offering also represents the first time a pool of municipal obligations has been sold through a structured financing in the taxable market.    Officials at Shearson Lehman declined to estimate or comment on sales to investors of the novel offering.    In the bond market yesterday, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 fell to a price of 95 30/32 from 97 6/32 Monday, as the yield surged to 9.28% from 9.15%. Shearson Lehman's index of long-term Treasury bonds tumbled 10.05 points to 1222.54. The index ranged between 1221.87 and 1234.69.    The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 fell to 96 31/32 from 97 3/4 as the yield climbed to 9.09% from 8.97% Monday.    Among short-term interest rates, the rate on federal funds averaged 6.85%, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.). The rate on federal funds, which are reserves banks lend each other overnight, averaged 6.95% Monday.    The rate on short-term Treasury bills were mixed. The rate on the government's new 13-week bills fell to 6.17% bid from an average of 6.19% at Monday's auction. The rate on the government's new 26-week bills rose to 6.37% from an average of 6.34% at Monday's auction.    Yesterday, the Treasury sold $9.5 billion of 52-week bills at an average yield of 6.74%, up from 6.52% at the previous 52-week bill auction Aug. 4 and the highest since an average return of 7.19% at the auction Feb. 13, 1986.    Here are details of yesterday's auction:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.  52-Week Applications .................. $32,203,090,000 Accepted bids........................... $9,503,650,000 Accepted at low price.............................. 21% Accepted noncompetitively ................ $494,440,000 Average price (Rate) .................... 93.185(6.74%) High price (Rate) ....................... 93.205(6.72%) Low price (Rate) ........................ 93.175(6.75%) Coupon equivalent ............................... 7.22%   The bills are dated Sept. 3 and mature Sept. 1, 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
