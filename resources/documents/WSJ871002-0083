One has been known to keep a black velvet pouch full of diamonds near his hot tub. Another, an accomplished stock swindler, received a new identity under the federal witness protection program and began a new life-defrauding banks.    All are members of what prosecutors and fraud investigators describe as a rogues' gallery of dozens of professional scam artists who pop up over and over again in bank failures and fraud cases. Many investigators say they are a big reason fraud is booming.    &quot;I call them 'world class con men,'&quot; says Edward Pankau, head of Intertect Inc., a Houston-based investigation and consulting company that specializes in financial crimes. &quot;They defraud everyone and pay no one. And they rarely get in much trouble for it.&quot;    The so-called career paths of such individuals can be highly varied. Consider Michael Hellerman -- or is it Michael Rapp? In 1970, Mr. Hellerman was indicted in New York City for stock fraud. The next year, he pleaded guilty and gave federal prosecutors details of his role in elaborate, Mafia-backed stock swindles. Grateful prosecutors created a new identity for Mr. Hellerman as Mr. Rapp. They set him up in the restaurant business on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. There, he wrote a book titled &quot;Wall Street Swindler,&quot; in which he bragged about his life as a professional stock manipulator.    Within years, though, Mr. Rapp was back in banking. According to a series of lawsuits and federal indictments, Mr. Rapp bilked institutions from Florida to California to New York out of some $23 million over three years beginning around 1982. Among the methods noted in the indictments: Bribes to bank officers and phony promises to make big deposits in return for loans. At least one bank, one thrift and one credit union failed largely because of Mr. Rapp's schemes, regulators say.    Last year, Mr. Rapp was sentenced to 32 years in prison after being convicted of bank fraud in Orlando, Fla., federal court. But for many fraud artists, the chances of getting nabbed are slim, and penalties often light. Robert Bonner, U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, complains that almost 60% of the people he has convicted of bank fraud or embezzlement since January 1986 haven't done a day of jail time.    Even individuals with long records can get off easy. Lawrence Hoover, known for his passion for gold watches, pleaded guilty in 1984 to bank fraud in federal court in Jackson, Miss., after being charged with stealing about $1.5 million from Fidelity Bank in Utica, Miss. The bank later failed. According to Federal Bureau of Investigation records, Mr. Hoover had a record dating back to 1964 of numerous arrests on charges of swindling, theft and wire fraud. He has been hit by several judgments in civil tax-fraud cases, and in 1980 he pleaded guilty in federal court in Miami to &quot;engaging in fraudulent business practices&quot; in a case stemming from a scheme to defraud a brokerage house.    For his Mississippi bank fraud conviction, Mr. Hoover was fined $5,000, given five years probation and ordered to pay back $645,000 to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. -- of which he has paid not a penny, according to federal law enforcement officials. &quot;And no jail time -- incredible,&quot; says Mr. Pankau in Houston.    Equally incredible, regulators say, is the fact that banks sometimes fall for the most audacious of scam artists. Lanny Freeman of Houston has been named in at least 18 lawsuits accusing him of various swindles and other offenses, according to court records. In 1985, he was ordered to pay $160,000 in district court in Refugio, Texas, in a civil suit alleging fraud in a mineral lease deal. In 1986, he and three associates were ordered to pay almost $390,000 in district court in Houston in a civil judgment in an oil-partnership fraud. And last July 31, he was arrested on a fraud warrant issued in San Patricio County, Texas, for allegedly filing a doctored oil lease, law enforcement officials say. Trial is pending.    A spokesman for Mr. Freeman denies that he is a con man and says that &quot;he's just been mixed up with the wrong kind of people.&quot; Investigators say he has been known to wear eight gold rings, four for each hand. He once kept a pouch of diamonds in his office, near the hot tub and bar in a room decorated in &quot;early bordello,&quot; as one investigator says.    &quot;You'd think a banker would look at all that and say, 'Whoa, no way,'&quot; muses one private investigator familiar with Mr. Freeman. &quot;But Lanny is smooth. Hell, I've gotten drunk with him, and by the time we were through, I thought he was the greatest guy in the world.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Financial Fraud: Theories Behind Nationwide Surge in Bank Swindles&quot; -- WSJ, Oct. 2, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
