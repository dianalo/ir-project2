Ciba-Geigy had offered $36.50 a share.    The pharmaceutical and chemicals producer said that about six million shares were tendered, according to a preliminary count, giving Ciba-Geigy about 95% of Spectra-Physics.    Holders of Spectra-Physics who didn't tender their shares will receive $36.50 for each share when the acquisition is completed.    Spectra-Physics, based in San Jose, Calif., makes lasers and related products. Ciba-Geigy is a unit of Ciba-Geigy Ltd., Switzerland.    As a result of the acquisition, the New York Stock Exchange said it has suspended trading in Spectra-Physics common and will apply to delist the company. The exchange normally delists companies with fewer than 600,000 publicly held shares. </TEXT></DOC>
