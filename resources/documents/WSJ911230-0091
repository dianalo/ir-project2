The previously announced transaction involved the sale of9.5 million new common shares and issuance of four-yearwarrants for an additional 9.5 million shares.</LP><TEXT>   The purchase gives Banco de Santander a 13.3% stake in theLawrenceville, N.J., regional banking company, and more than23% if the warrants are exercised. First Fidelity is amongthe largest bank holding companies in the U.S., with $29billion in assets.   At the time the transaction with Banco de Santander wasannounced, First Fidelity officials said the increasedcapital would allow the bank to make acquisitions within itscurrent markets in New Jersey and Pennsylvania or in nearbyareas.   Banco de Santander, based in Madrid, has assets of $55billion and offices in 29 countries outside Spain.   The capital infusion raises First Fidelity's risk-adjustedTier I capital ratio to 8.38% from 7.24%, and totalrisk-adjusted capital ratio to 12.19% from 11.04%.   Noting the closing of the transaction, Standard andamp; Poor'sCorp. said it raised First Fidelity's subordinated debtrating to triple-B from double B-plus, and preferred stock totriple B-minus from double-B.   Including other ratings changes, about $650 million ofoutstanding long-term debt is affected. The issues wereremoved from Sandamp;P's CreditWatch, where they had been placed inMarch with positive implications.   Sandamp;P said the upgrades reflect completion of the Banco deSantander equity investment, as well as evidence of aturnaround in First Fidelity's banking operations.   &quot;After suffering from a series of asset quality-inducedlosses in the late 1980s, First Fidelity's new management hasbeen able to stabilize its asset quality problems, whilerestoring profitability, capital and liquidity to moresatisfactory levels,&quot; Sandamp;P said. &quot;Consequently, thesefinancial performance measurements are now in favorableuptrends. While this capital injection should accelerateFirst Fidelity's turnaround, rating upgrades alreadyanticipate considerable improvement in First Fidelity'soperating performance.&quot;   Management's intention to pursue new businessopportunities limits further upside rating potential in theshort term, Sandamp;P said.</TEXT></DOC>
