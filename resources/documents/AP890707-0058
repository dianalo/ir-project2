The London-based human rights group said it was seekingassurances ``that all those detained are not being ill-treated andthat they are being allowed prompt access to legal counsel,relatives and independent medical examiners.''   It also said in its statement that if the detainees were notbeing charged with a crime, they should be released without delay.   The Sudanese army said late Thursday that soldiers surrounded thehideout of ousted Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi and captured himwhen he tried to escape.   El-Mahdi, who led a civilian government, went into hiding afterthe coup. Soon afterward, the junta arrested about 45 seniorpoliticians and members of the ousted regime.   Amnesty International also recalled that before the coup, it hadexpressed concern about killings and torture committed by governmentforces and civilian militias in the southern Sudan.   Rebels in that region have been fighting the government for moreautonomy.</TEXT></DOC>
