RoseStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AEG LABORAIRLINES (AIR) </IN><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   After the resignation of its chairman and a major strategic reversal last month, Allegis Corp. might assume that its biggest troubles are behind it.    But some of the worst turbulence may still lie ahead, as the company tries to smooth labor relations at its giant United Airlines unit.    Allegis is striving to make the carrier united in more than just name. That means refocusing on the airline following the departure of Richard Ferris as chairman, as well as the abandonment of Mr. Ferris's broad travel-services strategy by putting Allegis's rental-car and hotel operations on the block.    The company's relations with United's contentious employee groups, however, appear to be getting worse, and at a critical time. The union representing 20,000 United machinists is already in contract mediation. Angered by the company's talk of concessions and its appointment of a special labor counsel, the machinists' negotiator last week told union local units to &quot;start preparing for the worst by formulating strike committees.&quot;    At the same time, the union representing 12,500 flight attendants is preparing for the start of its negotiations in the fall.    And the union representing 6,500 United pilots, whose proposal to acquire the airline helped lead to the upheaval in Allegis's executive suite, seems in no mood to compromise. It says it would make concessions only in return for &quot;significant majority&quot; ownership of the airline by its employees. The pilots contract is up for renegotiation early next year.    While tough talk from union leaders isn't unusual -- especially as negotiations near -- United's union leaders and many of their members say the bitterness runs deep. And despite the recent changes at the company, they say the problems are no closer to being resolved.    &quot;The employees I represent don't trust management that departed or management that's in place,&quot; says F.C. Dubinsky, chairman of the Master Executive Council of the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association.    The company's position is further complicated because the employee groups don't agree on goals. The machinists, for example, don't like the pilots' idea of an employee stock ownership plan at United.    &quot;The dissension among different groups of employees, all proposing or wanting something different, makes it difficult for the company to go along with any individual proposal on a logical basis,&quot; says Robert J. Joedicke, senior vice president and airline analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    United has little choice but to cut expenses, however, if it is to compete effectively with lower-cost rivals, analysts say. While airlines' costs are difficult to compare, United's costs are far higher than those of low-cost competitors such as Texas Air Corp.'s Continental Airlines. Steve Lewins, an analyst at Citicorp Investment Management, says United's operating costs per seat mile were 7.5 cents in the first quarter, compared with 6.7 cents for Continental and the Texas Air system.    One way to cut costs is to pare the corporate bureaucracy. Allegis took a big step in that direction early this year by dismissing 1,016 headquarters employees, or about one-fourth of the executive staff. More management layoffs are expected as early as next week.    But the cost-cutting attempts won't stop there. In a June 25 letter to stockholders, Frank A. Olson, Allegis's recently elected chairman and chief executive officer, said, &quot;A key effort will be to develop a realistic program for wage and benefit concessions and productivity gains, a must if United Airlines is to compete effectively.&quot; Mr. Olson tempered the statement with an assertion that employees wouldn't be required &quot;to accept wage and benefit levels and work-rule changes comparable to those of our lowest-cost competitors.&quot;    The concession talk angered union leaders and members, partly because it came in a letter to shareholders, while a letter to employees talked more broadly of becoming &quot;competitive to survive.&quot; Asked to comment on the situation, a young machinist at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport says: &quot;Nobody wants to go on strike. Nobody wants to take a wage cut, either.&quot;    While the company hasn't said where it might seek concessions, some outsiders believe any workable solution to United's cost problem would have to entail sacrifices by all of its employee groups. &quot;I think to make this work, it's got to be comprehensive,&quot; one analyst says. &quot;If you skin the pilots, you have to at least shave the mechanics so everyone feels they're being equitably treated.&quot;    The unions have other ideas.    John Peterpaul, vice president, transportation, for the International Association of Machinists, says that in negotiations so far, management has concentrated on getting more flexible work rules. &quot;If they think they're going to cut the wages of employees we represent, we're in for a difficult time,&quot; says Mr. Peterpaul, whose union returns to contract mediation with the company July 16.    Though her union hasn't taken a position on the pilots' proposal, Patricia A. Friend of the United unit of the Association of Flight Attendants says that if her members &quot;have to make concessions, we prefer to make concessions in order to own the company.&quot;    Stephen E. Tallent, a lawyer with Los Angeles-based Gibson, Dunn andamp; Crutcher who was retained by Allegis with the company's stated goal of improving labor relations and taking &quot;the leading role&quot; in contract negotiations, is himself the target of criticism of some union officials. Machinists officials, who called Gibson Dunn &quot;anti-union,&quot; told members Mr. Tallent was brought in &quot;to play hardball.&quot;    The machinists also complain that Mr. Tallent now has to step into complex negotiations that have been going on for months. &quot;From our viewpoint, we thought we were making some progress,&quot; Mr. Peterpaul says. &quot;We just don't know where we are now.&quot;    Mr. Tallent responds that while Gibson Dunn represents management, it isn't anti-union. While he won't go into details on the negotiations with the machinists, he says that &quot;their concerns may be totally baseless.&quot;    &quot;The silliest thing in the world would be for United to take an anti-union stance,&quot; Mr. Tallent adds.    Both Mr. Tallent and Mr. Olson, to whom he reports, were praised by some employees for making early contact with labor leaders. Soon after he took the assignment, Mr. Tallent called or met personally with leaders of each major union.    But even get-acquainted meetings have risks. Ms. Friend of the flight attendants union complains that Mr. Tallent gave &quot;vague&quot; responses to questions about his goals.    While Mr. Tallent has the difficult job of trying to boost employee morale while asking for concessions, analysts say compromises are possible. The company might, for example, concentrate on major changes in work rules or give employees an equity position in return for concessions. Mr. Lewins of Citicorp suggests the company also could mend relations by naming as a top executive at the airline someone who is respected by labor. </TEXT></DOC>
