The government also announced that, in cooperation withthe Bank of Canada, it has set targets for reaching pricestability in Canada in the 1990s.</LP><TEXT>   The measures were contained in the government's budget forthe fiscal 1992 year starting April 1. The budget, which wassubmitted to Parliament yesterday, projected anarrower-than-expected deficit of 30.5 billion Canadiandollars (US$26.5 billion) for fiscal 1992, unchanged from theestimated fiscal 1991 gap.   The budget contained only a few, comparatively minor taxchanges, principally an immediate 18% increase in thecigarette excise tax. No changes were proposed for corporateor personal income taxes.   The budget proposed cuts in spending on foreign aid, ingrants to provinces and business, and in subsidies forhousing. The cuts are expected to total C$2.11 billion whenfully implemented in fiscal 1993.   Budget revenue is projected to rise 6.4% in fiscal 1992 toC$128.50 billion. Expenditures are expected to rise 5.1% toC$159 billion. Spending on government programs, which doesn'tinclude debt-service costs, is projected to rise 6.9% infiscal 1992.   Finance Minister Michael Wilson said the proposedlegislated limits on government outlays would cap the averagegrowth rate of program spending at 3% a year from fiscal 1993through fiscal 1996. Legislation to impose the spendinglimits is expected to be introduced in Parliament this fall.Mr. Wilson said the legislation wouldn't allow increasedborrowing or increased taxes to fund higher-than-projectedspending.   The government also will propose legislation to establisha debt-servicing and reduction fund into which will flow allrevenue from a 7% value-added tax imposed on most goods andservices since Jan. 1. The move addresses the concern of manyCanadians that revenue from the new tax might be used tofinance new government programs.   Bank of Canada Governor John Crow said the government's&quot;intermediate&quot; inflation targets aim to lower inflation to arate of 3% by the end of 1992, to 2 1/2% by mid-1994 and 2%by the end of 1995. He said the aim after 1995 would be tocontinue to make &quot;steady progress&quot; toward stable prices. In1990, the consumer price index rose 4.8%.   &quot;Canada's inflation rate will be significantly less thanthat of the U.S.,&quot; the budget predicted. This shouldeliminate the spread between U.S. and Canadian short-terminterest rates, the document said. Short-term Canadianinterest rates are currently about 3.5 percentage pointsabove comparable U.S. rates.   Mr. Wilson said the government is relying on lowerinterest rates to help Canada's economy rebound from itscurrent recession in the second half of 1991.   He predicted that the rate on Canada's 90-day commercialpaper will decline this year to 9.5% from 13% last year. Thecountry's gross national product is expected to decline 1.1%this year despite the projected pickup in the second half.GNP is the total value of a country's output of goods andservices. Net public debt is expected to rise 8% this year toC$419 billion, or 59.8% of GNP.</TEXT></DOC>
