In a breach-of-contract suit filed in federal court in Baltimore, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. charged Mr. Mason, of Chevy Chase, Md., with violating a net-worth agreement that he signed with the government in 1985 when he was allowed to take control of the holding company, CFS Corp.    Columbia Federal's net worth fell $5.7 million below the required level in March 1986, according to the suit. The FSLIC accused Mr. Mason of failing to correct this deficiency. The agency seeks to force him to turn over his CFS stock to the government.    Mr. Mason couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.    In a separate civil case last month in Connecticut, Mr. Mason was charged with giving federal regulators &quot;false, misleading and incomplete notice&quot; that he received funds from John Peter Galanis, a tax-shelter promoter, to acquire a majority interest in the holding company. That charge is still pending.    In July, a federal jury found Mr. Galanis guilty of 44 criminal counts, including tax fraud, securities fraud, bank fraud, racketeering and bribery. Among other things, he was convicted of seizing control of Columbia Federal through fraudulent misrepresentations to federal regulators. Mr. Mason, one of the co-defendants in the criminal case, was acquitted. </TEXT></DOC>
