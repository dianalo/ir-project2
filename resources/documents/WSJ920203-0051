The contractors are suspected of having agreed to divideup projects in Saitama prefecture in pre-bid consultationswhile freezing out non-members, said FTC official FumioNoguchi. Mr. Noguchi said the FTC was considering filing acriminal complaint with Tokyo prosecutors over theconsultations, known as &quot;dango.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The dango system, which is a long-established custom inJapan's construction industry, has been a prime target ofU.S. trade negotiators. They say the system makes it almostimpossible for outsiders to enter Japan's lucrativeconstruction market.   In a series of Japan-U.S. Structural ImpedimentsInitiative talks, Japan agreed to U.S. demands that itincrease penalties and facilitate legal action against thedango system. The commission has never filed a criminalcomplaint against companies for participating in dango.   A spokesman for one of the contractors involved, TaiseiCorp., conceded that such a club existed, but he said it wasonly a &quot;friendly association&quot; and didn't engage in illegalactivity. Other company spokesmen declined comment, sayingthey would await the results of the FTC's investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
