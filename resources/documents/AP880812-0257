Federal regulators declared three more Texas banks insolventThursday, and their decision to count all 40 of FirstRepublicBank's former subsidiary banks as failed institutionsproduced a one-day total of 43 that raised the year's count to 86.   The list of failed Texas banks soared far beyond last year'stotal of 50 bank failures, the previous state record.   Of the total of 141 banks nationwide listed by the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. as having failed so far this year, morethan 60 percent have been in Texas. Four Texas banks have requiredfederal bailouts this year.   The three banks declared insolvent Thursday were First Bank inBalch Springs, Galena Park State Bank and West Houston NationalBank. First Bank and Galena Park will be merged with other Texasbanks, while West Houston National will not reopen but itsdepositors will have access to their money at Texas Commerce Bankof Houston, officials said.   The FDIC was named receiver for liquidation in all three cases.   Texas bank failures, like the nationwide figure, hitpost-Depression levels in 1986 and have increased since as thestate continues to feel the effects of the dramatic drop in oilprices and its resulting effects on real estate and the overalleconomy.   Texas led the nation in bank failures the past two years, with26 declared insolvent in 1986 and the 50 closed in 1987.   Regulators frequently cite liberal lending practices and hugeloan losses as reasons for Texas bank failures and also blamebanking officials for poor management.   Before the 1985 oil price free-fall, a risky loan could be madeand a bank could expect repayment from collateral if the loanfailed.   But with the depreciation of real estate because of the drop inenergy prices, many loans cannot be repayed, requiring banks to setaside more revenue to make up for the unpaid loans.   Thursday's announcement could further provoke First RepublicBankinvestors who have threatened legal action over the FDIC's move.Many of the 40 subsidiary banks were healthy but were declaredinsolvent by the government when First RepublicBank _ then thestate's largest bank holding company _ failed and was purchasedlast month by NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., under anFDIC-sponsored bailout.</TEXT></DOC>
