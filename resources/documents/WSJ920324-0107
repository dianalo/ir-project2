They alsolove beer. And that's how we got rid of them. We asked thelocal liquor distributor to save leftover brew from returnedkegs and then poured this into large saucers placedthroughout the garden. The slugs, attracted by the alcohol --and, we now suspect, the lure of easy sex -- crawled into thepans and passed out. After the &quot;slug fest,&quot; we simplydisposed of the participants.   But there has been a downside. As Jacques Ellul pointedout in his book &quot;The Technological Society,&quot; &quot;Every newtechnique implies unforeseen consequences.&quot; In this case, thebeer proved effective in our control of slugs. But we sincehave had a terrible problem getting rid of the barflies.</LP><TEXT>   Garrett Tomczak   Minneapolis</TEXT></DOC>
