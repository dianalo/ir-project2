An Order authorizing Phase I dismantlingof the facility and disposition of component parts was issued by the Commissionon July 14, 1986. Phase I dismantlement and disposition of component partshas been completed except for the disposition of 5000 pounds of activatedlead. This issue must be resolved for UCLA to be in compliance with thePhase I Order.Need for Proposed ActionIn order to prepare the facility for unrestricted access and use, the dismantlingand decontamination activities proposed by UCLA must be accomplished.Environmental Impact of the Proposed ActionAll decontamination will be performed by trained personnel in accordancewith previously reviewed precedures and will be overseen by experiencedhealth physics staff. Solid and liquid waste will be removed from the facilityand managed in accordance with NRC requirements. The staff has calculatedthat the collective dose equivalent for the project will be less than 2person-rem.These conclusions were based on the fact that all proposed operations arecarefully planned and controlled, all contaminated components are removed,packaged, and shipped offsite, and that the radiological control proceduresensure that releases of radioactive wastes from the facility are withinthe limits of 10 CFR Part 20 and are as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).Based on the review of the specific proposed activities associated withthe dismantling and decontamination of the UCLA facility, the staff hasdetermined that there will be no significant increase in the amounts ofeffluents that may be released offsite, and no significant increase inindividual or cumulative occupational or population radiation exposure.The staff has also determined that the proposed activities will not resultin any significant non-radiological impacts on air, water, land, or biotain the area.Alternative Use of ResourcesThe only alternative to the proposed dismantling and decontamination activitiesis to maintain the facility as a restricted area. This approach would includemonitoring and reporting for the duration of the safe storage period. However,the University intends to use the area for other academic purposes.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed action based upon the foregoing environmental assessment.We conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant effecton the quality of the human environment.For further details with respect to this proposed action, see the applicationfor Phase II decommissioning dated June 10, 1988, as supplemented.
