But it wasn't expecting the amount of controversy thaterupted internally. The halls and elevators of Lotus'sheadquarters buzzed with discussions. Dozens of employeesshowed up at a meeting scheduled by the human resourcesdepartment to discuss the issue. And employees sent so manymessages to the company's electronic bulletin board, calledSoapbox, that they crashed the electronic mail system.</LP><TEXT>   The ruckus at Lotus, a company full of young,well-educated professionals in one of the nation's moreliberal communities, indicates that opposition to homosexuallife styles is strong in the business world, even incompanies that endorse diversity in their personnel policies.   Some heterosexual employees fear Lotus will becomeattractive to homosexuals. &quot;Unless the world follows Lotus,it will almost certainly, over time, make Lotus increasinglygay,&quot; says a product developer who says he is uncomfortableabout the possibility.   Criticism of the program also comes from people inheterosexual relationships who aren't eligible. Lotus saysthe plan was designed to correct an inequity, becausehomosexuals can't legally marry to obtain benefits whileheterosexuals can. &quot;Every single employee at Lotus now hasthe ability to assure benefits for a partner,&quot; says MargaretBleichman, a programmer who helped design the new spousalequivalent benefits plan.   Other controversies over benefits for homosexual couplesare likely to erupt as more companies deal with the growth innontraditional families. With the Ozzie and Harriet model ofa male breadwinner, a homemaking wife and a few childrendwindling to just 25% of American families, &quot;almost everycompany is questioning the definition of a family,&quot; says DanaFriedman, president of Families and Work Institute, anonprofit research concern in New York.   Many human resources professionals expect that eventuallycompanies will extend benefits to unmarried but committedcouples -- including homosexual couples. For example, PeterHawker, corporate benefits manager at Digital Equipment Corp.in Maynard, Mass., says the computer maker is writing a new&quot;statement of philosophy&quot; on the definition of a family andwill then rewrite benefits policies. &quot;We believe it's up tothe employee to identify who the members of the employee'sfamily are,&quot; he says.   Only a few public and private employers provide healthcare benefits to partners of unmarried employees. In aFebruary study, Bureau of National Affairs, a Washington,D.C., research firm, found 17 civic or corporate healthbenefit plans with domestic-partners coverage.   Most private sector employers say the policy caused littlecontroversy. Not so in some cities. A referendum in SanFrancisco in 1989 overturned a law that allowed couples toregister as domestic partners with the city. Last year,voters reversed themselves, opening the way for the grantingof spousal equivalent benefits to city workers in July. InSeattle, where the Human Rights Department had ruled the citywas violating anti-discrimination laws and had ordered it toprovide domestic partner coverage, opponents unsuccessfullytried to overturn the ruling by referendum.   At Lotus, officials say most employees are enthusiasticabout its new benefit. Under the plan, gay and lesbiancouples are eligible for the same health benefits as marriedheterosexual couples. The partners must sign an affidavitthat they are each other's &quot;sole spousal equivalent andintend to remain so indefinitely,&quot; that they live togetherand that they are responsible for each other's welfare. Lotussays it doesn't plan to change the benefit.   A company spokesman says the lively electronic mail andcompany discussions reflect Lotus's openness to employeeparticipation. Nevertheless, the controversy surprised some.In many ways, Lotus is one of the nation's most &quot;politicallycorrect&quot; companies in its dealings with employees andcontroversial issues. It was early in barring product salesto South Africa (although this week it said it will sellsoftware there). It financed the award-winning &quot;Eyes on thePrize&quot; television series about the civil rights struggle whenmany other corporations backed away. And various groups havelisted it among the nation's best companies to work for.   Mark Aruda, a young marketing specialist who just gotmarried, says jealousy from heterosexuals caused some of thecontroversy. &quot;It's not always cut and dried that you can getmarried. It would have been nice to have those benefitsduring my courtship.&quot; A worker who criticized the plan onSoapbox wrote, &quot;The policy . . . discriminates againstheterosexuals who choose not to marry. If you choose to buyin to the married model, you can get your spouse insured. Ifyou don't buy in, you suffer.&quot;   But others thought leaving out heterosexual couples wasfair. &quot;In the event that homosexual couples are allowed tolegally marry, the policy goes away -- they will be coveredas any married couple is,&quot; wrote one.   Other employees had financial concerns. A productdeveloper calculated that if 100 of Lotus's 2,000 Boston areaworkers take the benefit at a cost of about $2,000 a person,&quot;that's $200,000 that doesn't go into the benefits pool. Itmight incrementally increase the amount I have to pay.&quot;   Russell Campanello, Lotus's vice president, humanrelations, estimates 150 people are eligible. Only eight havesigned up so far, he says. Lotus is self-insured, and itpromises that employees' share of their health costs won'tincrease because of the policy change.   Lotus says it doesn't expect homosexual partners to be anymore costly to insure than married partners. Some corporatebenefits managers initially fear that gay couples will becostly to insure because of the risk of AIDS. But cities thathave had spousal equivalent benefits for a few years, such asBerkeley and Santa Cruz, Calif., say that homosexual couplesare generally younger and don't have costly child-birthexpenses.   Mr. Campanello of Lotus adds that he &quot;collected a lot ofinformation and concluded that long-term, committedhomosexual couples are at no greater or less risk ofcatastrophic illness than married heterosexuals.&quot; He saysAIDS cases, which are generally treated at home, cost anaverage of $50,000 to $70,000 -- comparable to two weeks ofintensive care for cardiac arrest and a fraction of the$200,000 cost of a kidney transplant or long-term cancertreatment.   Moreover, many homosexual partners already have jobs andhealth benefits. And the IRS says that the value of insurancebenefits for unmarried partners is taxable, even thoughinsurance for married partners is tax free. Ms. Bleichman,the Lotus programmer, says that she and her partner decidedagainst taking the benefit because of the tax costs.   One reason companies offer benefits is to attract topemployees, and Lotus says the new benefits, along with itsreputation for embracing diversity, should make itincreasingly attractive. Polly Laurelchild, a Lotuscommunications specialist who pushed the company to adopt theprogram, says, &quot;we got floods of phone calls from people whosaid `we're proud of you. It shows Lotus has moral fiber.'&quot;   Other employees disagree. &quot;I'm insulted that Lotus isgoing to replace the term `spouse' with `spousal equivalent'in all policies,&quot; one wrote to Soapbox. &quot;Lotus is taking itupon itself to recognize same-sex couples as married. I findit to be profoundly immoral.&quot;   A programmer who voiced similar views says he was&quot;strongly encouraged&quot; to take a diversity training seminar.He says the seminar dealt with women and minority issues,&quot;but it's geared mostly toward the right point of view ongays-gayness is goodness.&quot; He says the seminar leaders &quot;arevery shrill&quot; in advocating homosexuality.   Another writer to Soapbox said, &quot;It will be very expensiveto the company, and there could be an increased potential forfraud.&quot; Another said employees might sign up a housematewithout any sexual involvement. But a defender of the policywrote back, &quot;I doubt that many roommates would run the legalrisks. . . . Finally, sexual involvement no more defines acommitted couple than the lack of it. Some married couples donot have sex.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
