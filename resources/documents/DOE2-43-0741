<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-43-0741 </DOCNO><TEXT>A growing number of medical imaging modalities produces images that areinitially calculated and stored as digital information in a computer.For diagnosis, archiving and communication a hardcopy (usually on X-rayfilm) is produced from these data. It is estimated that in 1995 about80% of all imaging procedures will generate digital images. This trendleads to the development of systems, where the X-ray film is not onlyreplaced in his function as a radiation detector, but also in his otherfunctions as the medium for image presentation, image communication andimage archiving. In short, one wants a completely digital picture archivingand communication system (PACS). The rationale behind PACS efforts isto achieve better functionality and to save costs, mainly by reducingthe consumption of expensive X-ray films and the need for storage spacefor film archives. 7 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
