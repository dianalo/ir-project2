South African military officials say the fighting is the worstin 23 years of bush war against the Sout-West Africa People'sOrganization.   Police Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand said 161 guerrillas and 19police had been killed since Saturday in a remote region near theAngolan border. He said 41 policemen and an undetermined number ofguerrillas were wounded.   Du Rand said police, aided by Namibian soldiers, were conducting``follow-up operations right through Ovamboland,'' the border stripwhere the SWAPO guerrillas have major support.   The independent South African Press Association said heavyfighting occurred Monday at Oshikango, a few miles from the border.   South African officials said the fighting was started byguerrillas who crossed the border Saturday from Angola, violating aU.N. accord that is to free Namibia from South African rule.   Under the agreement, all guerrillas are to remain in Angola atleast 100 miles north of Namibia's border until mid-May.   Guerrilla officials and the Angolan government claim thefighters have been in Namibia for some time and fired inself-defense after security forces attacked them.   Villagers in northern towns, most of whom support the rebels,said they believe the guerrillas left Angola to return home and didnot expect a fight because the independence process officially hasbegun.   The villagers said the guerrillas have no newspapers or radiosat their Angolan bush camps, have little contact with seniorguerrilla commanders and probably have little understanding of thepeace process.   South Africa, however, accused the guerrillas of trying toorganize armed bases inside Namibia.   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said: ``I have verylittle doubt that the plan was that they should infiltrate toestablish bases quickly, then they would have liked to claim thatthey have always been there.''   The government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said in aradio editorial issued in Johannesburg today that the guerrillaincursions ``bear all the signs of a planned and well-organizedoperation.''   U.N. officials on Monday permitted 1,500 South African andNamibian troops to leave their bases to help policeman fighting the1,200 guerrillas, South African Col. Japie Dreyer and otherofficers said.   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar saidthe fighting does not mean the peace plan is failing.   A United Nations investigation found that guerrillas had mounteda ``major incursion'' from Angola into Namibia during the weekend,said three Western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity.   The United States urged Pretoria to exercise restraint.Washington also said it was holding urgent consultations with theSoviet Union, Cuba and Angola to prevent the unraveling of thepeace accord.   ``All information available to us indicates that a majorinfiltration of northern Namibia by military forces of theSouth-West Africa People's Organization is occurring,'' said StateDepartment spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler in Washington.   Ms. Tutwiler said the guerrilla organization ``appears to betaking advantage'' of the vacuum created because U.N. peacekeepersstill are deploying to monitor the peace agreement.   Only about 1,000 of the planned 4,650 U.N. troops have beendeployed. ``We have 300 men in the northern part of the area. Youcannot say it is a failure,'' Perez de Cuellar said.   SWAPO, South Africa and Angola said Monday they remain committedto the U.N. plan, which calls for Nov. 1 elections leading toindependence early next year.</TEXT></DOC>
