Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FGRP BTI </CO><IN> TNM INS </IN><TEXT>   Farmers Group Inc. rejected a $4.5 billion hostile takeover attempt by B.A.T Industries PLC, and said it has had discussions with an unnamed third party regarding a possible leveraged buy-out of the company.    The Los Angeles-based insurer disclosed the discussions in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, adding that &quot;exploratory discussions concerning similar or other types of transactions may be held with others.&quot; A spokeswoman for Farmers declined to identify the third party.    Farmers said in the filing that other options it has been considering include a recapitalization or restructuring, the creation of a leveraged employee stock ownership plan, the sale of equity securities to one or more third parties, a stock buy-back, and the declaration of an extraordinary dividend to company shareholders.    Wall Street professionals have said that Farmers was considering options to fend off the advances of Batus Inc., the American operating unit of B.A.T, a London-based tobacco, retailing and financial services concern.    Farmers directors unanimously rejected Batus' $63-a-share tender offer, saying that its financial advisers, First Boston Corp. and Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., found the offer &quot;inadequate.&quot;    The company urged shareholders not to tender, noting that Batus's efforts to gain approval from insurance regulators in several states &quot;would take a substantial amount of time.&quot;    Farmers' rejection had been expected by industry analysts and observers, and it promises to extend the already protracted battle. Batus, based in Louisville, Ky., first approached Farmers in January with a $60-a-share offer, which Farmers directors promptly rejected.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Farmers stock closed at $60 a share, down 75 cents.    In Louisville, Batus said in a statement that &quot;we are disappointed that the Farmers board rejected our offer.&quot; But it said it still is interested in buying Farmers.    Batus said the $63-a-share offer, which Farmers rejected as inadequate, &quot;represents a premium of 47% over the $43 price at which Farmers shares closed on the day before our initial proposal.&quot;    Gerald Lewinsohn, an insurance industry analyst with Merrill Lynch, said that Farmers' discussions of a leveraged buy-out appear &quot;a little odd, given that the cash flow of the management of the company doesn't seem adequate to service the debt of an LBO. But there's always room for creativity.&quot;    In a leveraged buy-out, a company is acquired by a small group of investors, largely with borrowed funds. The debt is repaid with funds generated by the company's operations or through asset sales.    Mr. Lewinsohn said that Farmers' stance so far indicates &quot;they're really going to fight.&quot; But he added, &quot;I don't know if their defenses will be sustained.&quot;    As previously reported, Batus plans to launch a proxy fight to force Farmers management to discuss a takeover and has filed suits to void certain anti-takeover laws that might protect Farmers. Farmers in turn has filed suit to block the planned proxy fight. </TEXT></DOC>
