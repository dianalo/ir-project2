The move comes in the wake of mounting pressure on theFDIC and Fleet from businesses and members of Congress whosay Recoll's hard line on loan collection is hurting NewEngland's struggling economy.</LP><TEXT>   Fleet will pick the assets from about 1,500 Recoll-heldloans worth about $1.4 billion. These are so-called&quot;performing nonperformers,&quot; or loans on which borrowers haveremained current in their payments but are in default fortechnical reasons such as a drop in the value of collateral.   Sen. John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who had pushedfor the action, called it &quot;great news&quot; but said it was &quot;onlya first step.&quot; He proposes that yesterday's unprecedentedarrangement with Fleet be extended to other pools of failedbank loans managed by other institutions as a means ofpreserving jobs and preventing otherwise sound businessesfrom going under after their credit is pulled. Many borrowersfear that if they lose their loans they'll be unable to findnew ones because of tight credit.   &quot;I am convinced that a great many sound borrowers --borrowers who employ thousands of people in this state -- aresubject to liquidation through no fault of their own,&quot; Sen.Kerry said.   &quot;We can save jobs by reforming this process,&quot; he said.   Recoll was created earlier this year to liquidate for theFDIC some 16,000 loans, worth about $5.8 billion. Thegovernment assumed the loans after the failure of the Bank ofNew England in January.   When Fleet bought Bank of New England in July, it took on$14.5 billion of sound assets that remained in the failedbank and agreed to manage an asset pool still with the FDIC.   Fleet said it would pay full book value for the assets itbuys under the new arrangement but would have the option ofreturning them to the FDIC if the loans can't be worked out.   &quot;What many of these businesses need is a little breathingroom,&quot; said Fleet's chairman and chief executive, TerrenceMurray. He said the bank would have far more flexibility thanRecoll in trying to work out the loans and could thus salvagesome loans. And if they work, he added, &quot;we might make aprofit&quot; on some of them.   Still, he cautioned, &quot;that doesn't mean every borrowerwill come away happy. Some of these loans are just too fargone.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
