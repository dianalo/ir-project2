The information on hafnium application as absorbingand construction material in control elements of nuclear reactors isgiven.The development of EU/sub 2/O+HFO/sub 2/ and GD/sub 2/O/sub 3/+HFO/sub2/ compositions and nickel base alloys containing 16-18% HF,1-20%Zn,0.5-15%Smwhich are suggested for automatic control and radiation safety systemsof nuclear reactors is reported. HFB/sub 2/ is named as a neutron absorber.</TEXT></DOC>
