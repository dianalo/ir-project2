(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fifty years after Orson Welles'fictitious Martians invaded Earth, this town commemorated theanniversary Saturday with a parade, a carnival and a bronze reliefto mark the ``landing site.''   Revelers painted themselves green in honor of the 1938 Halloweeneve when the Mercury Theatre of the Air broadcast ``War of theWorlds'' and unwittingly duped up to 1 million Americans intobelieving that the end of the world was at hand.   Howard Koch, who adapted the H.G. Wells novel for the broadcast,was the marshal at Saturday's parade.   He told the crowd that a week before the show he still had notchosen an invasion site, so he bought a gas station map in NewJersey, closed his eyes and picked the hamlet of Grovers Mill. Heliked the name because it had an authentic ring to it.</TEXT></DOC>
