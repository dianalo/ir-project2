In the 1970's, state and federal governmentstook an active interest in geothermal energy in New Mexico. The studiesidentified 21 low-temperature sites in the state with the highest potentialfor commercial development. In 1980, the state initiated the GeothermalCommercialization Program. The program's goal is to promote the use ofgeothermal energy for economic development. The primary target is thesector of the commercial greenhouse industry growing high-value horticulturaland floricultural crops. New Mexico State University (NMSU) has becomethe center of the state's geothermal research program. The NMSU GeothermalGreenhouse Facility, constructed and operated by the New Mexico SolarEnergy Institute, is a 12,000-square-foot, geothermally-heated greenhousethat provides a testing facility for commercial growers considering southernNew Mexico for their operations. By 1985, the state's geothermal greenhouseindustry covered 13 acres. Since the NMSU greenhouses were constructedin 1986, two large greenhouse companies have taken advantage of the facilities.Flores de New Mexico, of Las Cruces, and Masson Southwest, Inc. of Linwood,Kansas, used the facilities for pilot studies of the area. Both havestayed in the area and have expanded. Flores de New Mexico built 10 acresof greenhouses on the NMSU campus and is planning a five-acre expansion,and Masson, Inc. is building a four-acre greenhouse in Radium Springs,NM. Geothermal technology is also being used by three greenhouse businessesin Hidalgo County's Animas Valley, south of Lordsburg. Beall Companyof New Mexico, Inc., Burgett Floral, Inc., and McCant's Greenhouse aretapping into the large thermal reservoir in the southwestern corner ofthe state.</TEXT></DOC>
