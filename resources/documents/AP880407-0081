Shultztoday asked King Fahd to rally Arab support for his Middle Eastpeace plan.   Shultz, who arrived today, also was expected to discuss theSaudis' purchase of long-range Chinese missiles.   There were few public signs that either Jordan or Israel waswilling to accept Shultz's initiative. But Shultz looked to theSaudi king to try to generate support within the Arab world for atwo-step plan for negotiations with Israel, a U.S. official said.   The Saudis, whose oil wealth is used to support Syria, Jordanand the Palestine Liberation Organization, repeatedly have affirmedthat they support a role for the PLO in any peace talks.   The United States has refused to deal with the PLO until itrecognizes Israel's right to exist and renounces terrorism.   After his meeting with Fahd, Shultz was to return to Jordan tomeet again with King Hussein. He met with Hussein Wednesday afterapparently failing to win over Israeli Prime Minister YitzhakShamir.   The State Department confirmed last week Ambassador Hume A.Horan has been withdrawn, six months after he took up his post inRiyadh, the Saudi capital. No clear reason has been cited for hisrecall. But it was widely believed that Horan was not consideredwelcome in Riyadh following his protests over the Chinese missiledeal.   Saudi Arabia stressed that it had not requested his transfer.   The Saudis evidently bought the CSS-2 missiles from China,keeping the United States in the dark, as a hedge against attack byfundamentalist Iran, which has called for the overthrow of theSaudi royal family.   Shultz has expressed concern because the missiles can be fittedwith nuclear warheads. The United States has accepted Saudiassurances the missiles are not nuclear-tipped.   The American official said Horan's troubles with the Saudis werepersonal and not political. He did not explain. The officialbriefed reporters aboard Shultz's plane on condition of anonymity.   A new ambassador, Walter J. Cutler, was expected to be named byPresident Reagan shortly, the official said.   Israel also assured the Reagan administration that it would notlaunch a pre-emptive strike against the missiles.   Israeli leaders have warned that the missile has a range of1,850 miles, enough to reach their country, with which Saudi Arabiaand most of the Arab world is technically in a state of war.   Pro-Israeli U.S. senators have moved to block U.S. arms sales toSaudi Arabia. U.S. officials have said the Saudis bought themissiles in frustration over repeated attempts by Congress to blockAmerican arms sales.   The missile purchase has stirred a new U.S. determination tocarry out a one-year agreement with Western allies to keepintermediate-range rockets out of the hands of Saudi Arabia,Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and other countries in the region.   While Saudi Arabia is not a direct party in the Arab-Israelinegotiations Shultz seeks, the official said the Saudis would beinvited if they wished to attend.   The possible participants are Israel, Jordan, Palestinians,Syria and Lebanon.   There were few public signs that Jordan was willing to embraceShultz's initiative following his apparent failure to win overIsraeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.   Chants of ``Shultz, Shultz go home'' echoed through the JebelHussein refugee camp in Amman early today as 200 Palestiniansstaged an illegal march to protest the visit.   Jordanian newspapers sharply criticized Washington's refusal ofPalestinian demands for an independent state or complete Israeliwithdrawal from lands captured in 1967.   ``He should understand that his peace mission is a flop,'' thedaily Sawt ash-Shaab said in an editorial.   At the halfway point in his second Middle East tour in a month,Shultz told Israel Television on Wednesday he was still committedto making his plan work.   ``In all candor, I am not able to say that it is happening,'' hesaid. ``While we have made some progress, differences have not beensubstantially narrowed.''   Shultz ended his visit to Israel on Wednesday without overcomingShamir's opposition to his call for an international peaceconference or to the concept of surrendering land captured in 1967in return for peace. More than 135 Arabs, one Israeli soldier andone Israeli settler have been killed in four months ofanti-occupation rioting in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Shultz then flew to Egypt for talks with President HosniMubarak, who reasserted his support for the U.S. proposal.</TEXT></DOC>
