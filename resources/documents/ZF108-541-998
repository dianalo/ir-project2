or 6&quot; Silicon wafers for 4M parts, IBM Japan is using 8&quot; wafersthat can carry 300 4Ms, triple the number produced on 5&quot; wafers; while it isnot expected that IBM Japan's production will directly affect the local chipmarket, it may affect price competition as the company substitutes home-grownparts for the ones it buys in.andM;- o -andM;The company regarded as most responsible for bringing Japan into the personalcomputer era through the development of the Atok Japanese keyboard handlingand character conversion software, Just Systems Inc of Tokushima, is to doversions of the Atok system utility and the best-selling IchiTaroo wordprocessing package to a Unix workstation base: Just Systems says that therequest for it to do this came from many sources, including universities,which wanted to be able to use workstations with the same ease as personalcomputers with Japanese language processing support; since Just Systemsreleased Ichitaroo in 1985 cumulative sales have reached 600,000 units anddoing versions of Atok and IchiTaroo to a Unix base will open up a wealth ofapplications to Unix; sales this year of Unix workstations tipped to rise 50%to 130,000 units.andM;- o -andM;Kobe Steel Co has paid $5m for its 8% stake in 2.5&quot; disk drive pioneer,PrairieTek Inc, Longmont, Colorado: Kobe Steel's intention is to supply harddisk drive parts to Prairietek in exchange for becoming its Japanese agent;another Japanese company, Alps Electric Co, is already an investor in theLongmont firm.andM;- o -andM;Canon Inc has introduced a Japanese language version of Hewlett-Packard Co'sNewWave environment, Japanese NewWave Developers Kit Version 2: the price isa little over $1,000.andM;- o -andM;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co is ready to surrender in the rate-cutting war withthe two new interntional carriers, International Digital Communications Ltdand Intermational Telecom Japan, saying that any further rate cuts will becounter-productive: the former monopoly international carrier has reducedrates twice in the last six months, in November and April, but its profitsfell in the year to March for the first time in three years - but it willincrease promotion of its international call interpreting service, after a1.6 times increase in the volume of calls to around 7,000 calls; thetranslation service is managed by the company's KDD Teleserve subsidiary,which was established in 1986.andM;- o -andM;Diversifying machinery company Kubota Corp's computer sales subsidiary,Kubota Computers, is to sell the MIPS Computer Systems Inc RS3230 desktopworkstation in Japan under an exclusive distribution agreement: the machineis claimed to be cost half what comparable 20 MIPS colour machines do, at$7,600 in minimum configuration, $13,260 a for standard one.andM;- o -andM;Delving beyond the headline 10.5% increase in turnover for IBM Japan to$8,300m on which profits fell 4% to $1,225m - explained away by presidentShiina as the result of investment for growth, and depreciation costs, itturns out that 3090 sales were up 10%, sales of the AS/400 rose 20% and salesof the PS/55 Japanese versions of the PS/2 rose 30% - and software businessalso grew 30%, which is a lot better performance than the company achievedelsewhere; the company says that demand for networked implementations wasparticularly strong in the retail and distribution sectors; as for the$2,271m exports, most of this came from the disk drives manufactured at theFujisawa plant, notably the 3.5&quot; drives that are made there for the worldmarket - the company says it turned out over 5m and that the current outputof 10,000 a day is the highest in the world; for the current year, IBM Japansees growth of around 10%.andM;- o -andM;One of Fujitsu Ltd's major manufacturing subsidiaries, Fujitsu YamanashiElectronics, is to invest $195m in a new 160,000 square foot plant to makeGallium Arsenide and high electron mobility transistor chips with occupationdate set for next spring: total sales of Gallium Arsenide chips are expectedto reach $33m in 1991, rising to $78m in 1992; the plant's production of HEMTchips used in converters for satellite broadcast antenna will represent 70%of the world's output; Fujitsu Yamanashi will also take research staff fromFujitsu to bolster its research activities.andM;- o -andM;Trading company Nissho Iwai Co has teamed with Mountain View, Californiasoftware distributor Softsel Computer Products to establish Japan's firston-line personal computer software sales operation: it will run along thesame lines as many on-line personal computer sales services in the US, with alist of the 2,000 most popular MS-DOS and Macintosh packages available overthe Nifty-serve network, which is run jointly by Fujitsu Ltd and Nissho-Iwai,Nifty-serve; orders placed over the network will be transmitted once a day toSoftsel and the products will be delivered to the Japanese customer withintwo to three weeks; payment will be by credit card and the service isintended improve the limited range of software available in Japan, attributedto the high cost of holding stock in Japan's super-pricey cities - this willbe a no-stock operation; and considerable demand is anticipated fromenthusiasts and from researchers.andM;- o -andM;Among the major manufacturers, for the year to March, Fujitsu Ltd recordedcomputer sales of $9,750m, $1,690m of which was exported.andP;  C Corp's computersales were $8,644m, but only $923m went for export - Bull SA and Bull HNdon't buy that many DPS 9000s; Hitachi Ltd did $7,140m in computers, $1,300mof which was exported; Toshiba Corp did $3,341m in computers; the top eightcomputer firms by sales in Japan are Fujitsu; IBM Japan; NEC; Hitachi;Toshiba; Nippon Unisys; Oki Electric Industrial Co and Mitsubishi ElectricCo.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
