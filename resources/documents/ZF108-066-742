 Panelists addressed the legalimplications of electronic information, the marketing of on-line services,the effect of information technology on the Canadian economy, and the role ofgovernment in the on-line business.andM;Bonnie Campbell, Campbell Consulting Ltd., noted a trend towards the in-houseproduction of CD-ROMs.andM;Campbell said two Canadian companies Reteaco and Optim, have recentlyintroduced products that allow companies to produce and master their ownCD-ROMs.andM;In-house CD-ROMs, she said, are often used to store exceptionally large setsof documentation.andP;  Pointing out unusual implementations of CD-ROM technology,she told her audience that &quot;new Mac trucks will soon be equipped with CD-ROMplayers that will include the full service manual for the truck.andM;&quot;Firms such as Northern Telecom are beginning to issue their voluminous setsof technical manuals on CD-ROM and distribute the CD-ROMs to clients,&quot; shesaid.andM;Nancy Miller of Miller, Toller andamp; Evans said that Evans Research studiesindicate on-line searchers in Canada spend half their connect time accessingCanadian-content databases.andP;  This interest in Canadian content was anencouraging statistic for producers of Canadian on-line databases.andM;Rapid changeandM;&quot;Hyperchange and decentralization&quot; were the primary information technologytrends mentioned by John Helliwell, formerly executive editor of PC Week.andM;Hyperchange he described as the belief that the computer business is going tocontinue to change and change rapidly.andP;  Any prediction for the future thatleaves out either of these trends is a prediction you can discount, he noted.andO;His advice on planning for the future: &quot;Expect the future to change longbefore it happens.&quot;andM;Helliwell predicted that the future for on-line services, in theirtraditional role of providing inert data, is bad.andP;  If CD-ROM becomes themedium of choice, he said, on-line becomes the medium of non-choice.andP;  Hepredicted that the brightest future for on-line services belongs to those whoprovide interactive services, such as Compuserve.andM;In a session on expert systems and knowledge bases, Michael Sutton of TheosPhilos Teknikos entertained his audience with diagrams of how Sherlock Holmesused semantic networks to solve crimes.andM;Referring to &quot;object bases&quot; as the next step beyond traditional &quot;databases&quot;,he explained how such systems offer &quot;freedom of access&quot; as opposed to the&quot;precision and recall&quot; of current systems.andP;  Hypermedia, he maintained, willemerge as a primary design element in connecting nodes of information.andM;Keynote speaker Graeme Hughes, from the Information Technology Association ofCanada (ITAC), reported that &quot;Information technology is a 'phantom force' --an invisible force spreading through the economy.&quot;andP;  Referring to hisorganization's recent report, The Enabling Effect, he stressed thatinformation technology is an &quot;enabling technology&quot; and &quot;may be the singlemost important factor in determining winners and losers.&quot;andM;Hughes warned his audience that Canada is lagging behind in seizing theopportunities of information technology, and that it is private industry,rather than government, that must move information technology to theforefront of business management.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
