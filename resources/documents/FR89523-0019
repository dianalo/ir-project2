Although the cause of the accident has not yet been determined,it has become clear that the airplane had numerous fatigue cracks and agreat deal of corrosion. Subsequent inspections conducted by the operatoron the high-cycle airplanes in its fleet revealed that two other airplaneshad extensive fatigue cracking and corrosion. These airplanes were takenout of service. In June 1988, the FAA sponsored a conference on aging airplanes. It becameobvious, because of the huge increase in air travel, the relatively slowpace of new airplane production, and the apparent economic feasibilityof operating older technology airplanes, that older airplanes will continueto be operated rather than be retired. Because of the problems revealedby the accident described above, it was generally agreed that increasedattention needed to be focused on this aging fleet and maintaining itscontinued operational safety. The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America and the Aerospace IndustriesAssociation (AIA) of America committed to identifying and implementingprocedures to ensure continuing structural airworthiness of aging transportcategory airplanes. An Aging Aircraft Task Force, with representativesfrom the aircraft operators, manufacturers, regulatory authorities, andother aviation representatives, was established in August 1988. The objectiveof the Task Force was to sponsor ``Working Groups'' to (1) select servicebulletins, applicable to each airplane model in the transport fleet, tobe recommended for mandatory modification of aging airplanes, (2) developcorrosion-directed inspections and prevention programs, (3) review theadequacy of each operator's structural maintenance program, (4) reviewand update the Supplemental Structural Inspection Documents (SSID), and(5) assess repair quality. The Working Group assigned to review Boeing Model 747 series airplanescompleted its work on Item (1), above, in March 1989. The Working Group's,proposal is contained in Boeing Document Number D6-35999, ``Aging AirplaneService Bulletin Structural Modification Program_Model 747.'' The FAA hasreviewed and approved this Document. The Document references modifications described in 29 service bulletinsand recommends they be incorporated in the applicable Boeing Model 747airplanes. In addition, the Document describes additional modificationswhich will be included in upcoming revisions to those service bulletins.These modifications consist of 8 modifications to the wing, 13 modificationsto the fuselage, 1 modification to the empennage, 4 modifications to thelanding gear, and 5 modifications to the engine strut. They include structuralreinforcement/replacement of skins, stringers, bulkheads, frames, ribs,spars, and other structural members. Completing these modifications willreduce the possibility for major structural failure. Since fatigue cracking and corrosion is likely to exist or develop on otherairplanes of this same type design, an AD is proposed which would requiremodification of Boeing Model 747 series airplanes at their economic designgoal or, in some cases, at a specific time, in accordance with the BoeingDocument previously described. The ``economic design goal'' of an airplane is typically considered tobe the period of service, after which a substantial increase in the maintenancecosts is expected to take place in order to assure continued operationalsafety. The economic design goal for the Boeing Model 747 airplane is 20years for structural problems associated with environmental deterioration,and 20,000 flight cycles for structural problems associated with fatiguedamage. The proposed compliance time for implementation of the mandatory structuralmodification program is upon reaching the applicable economic design goalor within 4 years after the effective date of the AD. This time intervalwas based upon the ability of the manufacturer to provide the parts necessaryfor the modification, and the time necessary to incorporate the modifications.In the interim, safety will be provided by various means currently in placethat are considered satisfactory to detect damage prior to the occurrenceof an unsafe condition. These include operators' on-going basic maintenanceprograms; continuing inspections required by numerous previously issuedAD's; the Supplemental Structural Inspection Document (SSID) program, previouslymandated by AD 84-21-02, Amendment 39-4936 (49 FR 44890; November 13, 1984);the FAA's increased emphasis on surveillance of operators' maintenanceprograms and procedures; and the FAA's participation in programs to physicallyinspect high-time airplanes during scheduled heavy maintenance. There are approximately 680 Model 747 series airplanes of the affecteddesign in the worldwide fleet. It is estimated that 20 airplanes of U.S.registry would be affected by this AD within the initial threshold of 4years. The cost to modify each airplane is estimated to be $2,300,000.This cost includes the price of modification kits, which is $900,000 perairplane, and the estimated number of manhours to accomplish the modifications,which is 35,000 manhours at $40 per manhour. It does not include downtime,planning, set up, familiarization, or tool acquisition costs. Based onthese figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimatedto be $46,000,000 over the 4 year time period. Additional airplanes will be affected as they accumulate time-in-serviceand reach the threshold for modification. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draftevaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket.A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend Part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 39) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
