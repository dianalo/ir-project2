Some companies want proof.   Avis is requiring customers in some areas to provide datedreceipts for gasoline purchases when they turn in rentalcars. Too many renters claimed to have filled tanks when theyhadn't, the company says, though it won't give figures.   Industry officials say fibbing about filling up may not beon the rise, but the travel slump has everyone looking at thebottom line. &quot;We lost $3.25 million systemwide {in 1990} onuncollected gas charges,&quot; says a Thrifty Rent-a-Car Systemspokeswoman. &quot;Avis is five times our size. It's a hugeproblem.&quot; Thrifty doesn't require gas receipts; it billscustomers if the tank isn't filled, but few people pay.   With its plan, Avis aims to cut its administrative costsof $3 to $4 a car to track down errant renters and eliminatethe time and trouble Avis employees devote to the task. Thefill-up problem was most common at certain Avis locations,particularly around airports where gas stations aren't easilyaccessible. The program started in Washington, D.C., in Apriland has been spreading since.   Other rental car companies say Avis's solution is itself aproblem. Hertz gave up a receipt requirement after a six-weektest last fall. &quot;Operationally, it was a headache,&quot; aspokesman says. Budget Rent A Car doesn't require any proof.&quot;We certainly find our customers are forthright,&quot; aspokeswoman says.                                                                                                          Upstart British Carrier   Offers Unusual Perk                                                                                                          FOR trans-Atlantic and Pacific flights, American Airlinespromotes its extraroomy seats, each with its own personalvideo recorder, and boasts about its lobster fajitas andaward-winning wines. On all movie flights, Northwest Airlinesshows a five-minute &quot;Airobics&quot; video of exercises travelerscan do in their seats.   But perhaps the most unusual sky perk is Virgin Atlantic's&quot;beauty therapist.&quot; The seven-year-old carrier, owned byBritish entrepreneur Richard Branson, has a certifiedmasseuse and beautician for first and business classtravelers on its trans-Atlantic flights. The airline creditsMr. Branson with the idea. &quot;He tried to figure what he'dlike,&quot; a spokeswoman says, and he thought: &quot;What about abeautiful woman giving him a massage?&quot;   The therapist, Jane Breeden, schedules complimentaryappointments at the beginning of each flight. She gives20-minute Swedish, pressure-point or Shiatsu massages onscalps, necks and shoulders. She also applies facial wrapsand does manicures, though without nail polish, which is &quot;toonoxious in the cabin,&quot; the spokeswoman says.   Ms. Breeden has time for about 15 passengers on flightsbetween New York or Boston and London, and 23 on LosAngeles-London flights. The airline says most of hercustomers are men because more men than women fly first andbusiness class.   Catching one of her flights is a hit-or-miss affair sinceshe rotates on different flights week to week. To remedythat, Virgin plans to add two more therapists by the end ofJanuary.                                                                                                          Frequent-Flier Programs   May Take Hold in Europe                                                                                                          MOST foreign airlines already have ties to various   U.S. frequent-flier programs. But with deregulation on theway, European carriers may be forced to start their ownprograms to compete for passengers.   The plans at home and abroad aren't likely to compete, atleast not initially. U.S. fliers will still be able to rackup Continental One-Pass miles, for example, if they flyAlitalia round trip from the U.S. But many foreign airlinesdon't give mileage -- or rewards -- for flights thatoriginate outside the U.S.   Only three European carriers have frequent-flier programsup and running: Iberia Air Lines' Iberia Plus, BritishAirways' Air Miles Latitude and Virgin Atlantic's Freeways.Lufthansa may allow individuals into its frequent-flierprogram for corporations, and Alitalia plans to unveil itsown program next year. Other carriers are studying U.S.programs to see whether they will work in Europe. But theprograms aren't, or won't be, open to U.S. residents.   &quot;I believe in the next six months, every European carrierwill have one, as '92 {and deregulation} gets closer,&quot; saysRandy Petersen, editor of the newsletter Frequent. Mr.Petersen says most European carriers have been in touch withhim about how to implement such programs.   Frequent-flier programs haven't taken hold in Europe forseveral reasons, including a host of conflicting rules withinEurope regarding their legality. And with regulated skies,European carriers haven't faced cutthroat competition forpassengers.   Europeans are of two minds about the plans, says AnthonyBacci, director of American Airlines' AAdvantage program. Onthe one hand, &quot;it's something those crazy Americans aredoing, {but} also, `Hey, maybe they've got a good idea.'&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          THE best-dressed people on Alitalia's flights may be theflight attendants, in new olive and amber uniforms designedby Giorgio Armani. . . . Delta Air Lines says it will providein-flight radio broadcasts of live sporting events, news,financial updates and weather from USA Today Sky Radio onmany of its jets, starting early next year. Delta says itwill be the first airline with live radio broadcasts. . . .The cost of new U.S. passports jumped Friday to $65 from $42.Renewals rose to $55 from $35; passports for children under18 rose to $40 from $27.</TEXT></DOC>
