It also warned Britons living in Lebanon to leave, saying theyare under increased threat following Iran's severing of diplomaticties with Britain on Tuesday. Three Britons are held hostage inLebanon.   The foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, announced theexpulsions in the House of Commons. Britain also ordered the closingof the Iranian consulate in Hong Kong, a British colony, and gavethe staff two weeks to leave, Howe said.   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said upto 30 Iranians will be ordered to leave Britain.   Howe's comments came after an Iranian newspaper today said thebreak in British-Iranian ties will adversely affect the Britishhostages in Lebanon. Also today, a group holding two Americanhostages said it has completed plans to kill Rushdie, whose newbook, ``The Satanic Verses,'' led to the break.   Another Iranian newspaper said Tehran must also cut economic tieswith Britain and threaten other Western nations with the same actionunless they suppress ``The Satanic Verses,'' which some sayblasphemes Islam.   Howe, noting Iran has refused to revoke its death sentenceagainst Rushdie, said: ``We have therefore decided on securitygrounds a number of Iranians must be required to leave thiscountry.''   ``We are keeping the activities of other Iranians under veryclose review,'' he added. Howe said the expulsion orders would beissued shortly. There are about 25,000 Iranians in Briton.   One government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthose expelled ``will be people held to have close links with the(Iranian)regime.'' Using his strongest language since thecontroversy began, Howe called the Iranian government a ``deplorableregime.''   Responding to calls by legislators to ban trade with Iran, Howereplied: ``We stand ready to take whatever action may be necessaryin the light of events.''   In Beirut, the pro-Iranian Revolutionary Justice Organizationsaid it has ``completed its preparations to execute the justsentence issued by esteemed cleric and great struggler AyatollahKhomeini against Salman Rushdie.''   Khomeini sentenced Rushdie to death Feb. 14. Rushdie was borninto a Moslem family in India and is a naturalized British citizen.He has been in hiding since the death order.   The statement, delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut, said``the execution'' will be preceeded by attacks on British police.The statement was accompanied by an instant photograph of hostageEdward Austin Tracy, of Burlington, Vt., but it did not threaten thehostages.   The group also holds writer Joseph James Cicippio, 58, of ValleyForge, Pa., who was acting comptroller of the American University ofBeirut when he was abducted.   Iran's Kayhan International newspaper said of the Rushdiecontroversy: ``The event will leave its negative impact on the fateof the British hostages in Lebanon.''   The British hostages are Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, 49;journalist John McCarthy, 32; and Brian Keenan, 38, anEnglish-language teacher at the American University of Beirut. Allare believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems.   The British Embassy in Beirut today advised Britons againsttraveling to Lebanon and advised the estimated 125 already there toleave. The warning was broadcast by Christian-controlled radiostations.   There are 15 hostages, including nine Americans, held in Lebanon.Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, is the hostage held longest. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985and has been held longer than any hostage.   Tehran's Farsi-language Abrar called for an end to economic tieswith Britain just one day after Iran announced the severing ofdiplomatic relations.   Kayhan International and Abrar both warned that Iran's relationswith other Western nations may be cut because of those countries'support of Britain and their withdrawal of envoys from Tehran. Theirreports were carried by Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, whichis monitored in Nicosia.   Iran in 1987 imported $528 million in goods from Britain. Iran'sexports to Britain that year totaled $321 million.   Britain's 11 European Economic Community partners, as well asCanada, Norway and Sweden, recalled their diplomats from Iran afterKhomeini ordered Rushdie killed. Only the Swedish envoys havereturned to Tehran.   A trade ban would prevent European nations from winning lucrativecontracts to help Iran's reconstruction following its eight-year warwith Iraq. The cost of rebuilding has been estimated at up to $500billion.   IRNA quoted Abrar as saying: ``It is now up to the country'spolitical officials to remove the assumption of preserving economicrelations from the minds of London-dwellers, and warn other Westerncountries against the consequences of enmity toward Islam and theIslamic Republic.''   Abrar concluded: ``British colonialism must taste its firstbitter experience of insulting the beliefs of more than 1 billionMoslems in the world.''</TEXT></DOC>
