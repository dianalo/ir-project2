Employees at about 50 factories and at the republic's ports andrailroads agreed to return to work after strike leaders and Estonianofficials set an agenda for negotiations Thursday, Chekatovksy said.   State-run Moscow Radio reported early today that the talks weremeant to ``ease the highly charged political and economic situationin Estonia and calm down ethnic passions.''   The Russian workers walked out to protest a law passed Aug. 8 bythe Estonian parliament that set the Soviet Union's first residencyrequirements for voters and candidates. Russians and othernon-ethnic Estonians, who make up about 40 percent of the republic'spopulation of 1.6 million, complained that about 80,000 of themwould be disenfranchised.   The national Presidium on Wednesday declared the lawunconstitutional in a decision approved by President Mikhail S.Gorbachev.   Chekatovksy said that although the strike might be renewed, ithad accomplished many of its organizers' goals.   ``Moscow and the whole Soviet Union and the world started to payattention to us,'' he said.   Strike leaders on Thursday said they planned to continue thestrike until Estonian leaders agreed to accept the Presidium'sdecision and change the law, but Chekatovsky said strike committeeand factory representatives voted late Thursday to return to work.   The strike ``was starting to work against us,'' he said,referring to the growing economic difficulties it caused in the tinyBaltic republic.   Izvestia, the government daily, on Thursday quoted RailwayMinister Nikolai Konarev as saying the walkout had idled 3,000railcars in Estonia, of which more than 700 were left on railwaylines, blocking dozens of trains from proceeding.   In Tallinn alone, where all stations that load and unload freightwere paralyzed by the walkout, 34 trains carrying perishablefoodstuffs and other goods waited to be discharged Thursday, Konarevsaid.   In another area threatened by nationalist labor unrest, Russianworkers in Moldavia staged a two-hour warning strike Wednesday. Theywere protesting a proposed law that would make Moldavian therepublic's official language.</TEXT></DOC>
