Themeasured diffusion coefficient is 1.13x10/sup -10/ m/sup 2/ s/sup -1/at 300/sup 0/C and 1.23x10/sup -10/ m/sup 2/ s/sup -1/ at 350/sup 0/C.The results are in reasonable agreement with measurements carried outby vacuum extraction analysis. The value obtained for the diffusion coefficientat 350/sup 0/C is lower than a prediction based on measurements at lowertemperatures and may be showing the influence of the break-up of the{beta}-phase, although some effect due to tube-to-tube variability cannotbe discounted. NRA detects a surface deuterium peak which is shown tocorrelate with the bulk deuteride concentration.</TEXT></DOC>
