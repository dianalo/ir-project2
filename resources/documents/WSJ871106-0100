The panel voted 9-6 for a compromise measure that would roll back some deregulation provisions of a 1980 law. Supporters, including electric utilities and coal producers, say the bill would require the Interstate Commerce Commission to protect shippers that are captive to a single railroad.    Carriers had lobbied intensely to derail the bill, which they say could bring back the financial problems that plagued railroads before they were deregulated seven years ago. A Consolidated Rail Corp. spokesman said the bill was the &quot;first step on the road to disaster for the railroad industry.&quot;    But Rep. Frederick Boucher (D., Va.), who proposed the original bill and was one of the proposers of the compromise, said: &quot;The ICC has a sorry record of enforcing captive-shipper protection. The bill will give captive shippers a reasonable opportunity to obtain rate relief before the ICC.&quot;    The legislation would shift to railroads the burden of proving that their rates to captive shippers are reasonable, making it easier for a shipper to challenge a rail rate before the ICC. The bill also would make it easier for captive shippers to gain access to competing railroad lines.    The bill also would require the ICC to review fully sales of railroad lines longer than 500 miles, which could damp formation of regional railroads. The ICC has exempted such sales from full merger scrutiny, which could take nearly three years. Rail labor unions have opposed the new regional lines, which operate without the costly work rules and manning requirements of major railroads.    If the bill is adopted by the full committee, it will face a battle next year on the House floor and in the Senate. The House previously ordered that bills that emerge from committee after last Oct. 15 won't be considered by the full House until 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
