The pact seeks to preserve the natural layer of ozone gasin the stratosphere that shields the planet from the sun'sharmful ultraviolet rays. A group of widely used chemicals,chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, halons and carbontetrachloride, have already destroyed 3% of global ozone.</LP><TEXT>   Today's agreement would commit industrialized nations tobanning the chemicals by the year 2000. Developing countries,with only 15% of world use, have an extra decade to comply.   But the accord is expected to cause turmoil in thechemical business, industry officials say. In place of the $2billion-a-year world market for CFCs and halons, a new marketfor ozone-friendly substitute chemicals will emerge. And thatmarket will favor the chemical giants because they have thebig laboratories and bulging treasuries needed to develop thesubstitutes. Global development costs may exceed $4 billion.   &quot;There's going to be a radical shakeout in the market,&quot;predicts Bridget Paterson, a product manager at Britain'sImperial Chemical Industries PLC. &quot;There won't be 32suppliers anymore in the world; it will be six to 10.&quot;   The most likely survivors in the ozone-friendly market arethe leaders today in CFC production: Du Pont Co., Wilmington,Del., Hoechst AG of West Germany, ICI, Atochem S.A. ofFrance, Allied-Signal Inc., Morristown, N.J., and Japan'sShowa Denko KK. Companies with much smaller operations in therefrigerant market, such as Italy's Montedison S.p.A. andFrance's Rhone-Poulenc S.A., may have difficulty keeping up.   Already, the chemical companies are jockeying for positionin the new markets. At this week's world ozone conference,for instance, several European CFC makers were pushing forlanguage in the accord allowing them to merge their Europeanoperations, something discouraged under an earlierinternational CFC pact.   Without such mergers, said Joachim Von Schweinichen ofMontedison's Montefluos division, the European industry wouldremain fragmented and unable to compete with bigger U.S.rivals. Not surprisingly, U.S. manufacturers were lobbyingagainst the change. The issue wasn't expected to be resolveduntil today.   Public relations is another important tool in the battle.For instance, ICI and Du Pont are vying to be first to begincommercial production of an important ozone-friendlysubstitute, called hydrofluorocarbon 134a or HFC 134a.Officials of both companies boasted they would win the racelate this year or early next year.   The allure for the companies is the potential of biggerprofits, although nobody knows whether the ozone-friendlyproducts will have fatter or slimmer profit margins thanCFCs.   By chemical industry standards, making CFCs is a simple,low-tech business with relatively modest profit margins of10% to 12%. But as the year 2000 deadline for phasing outCFCs approaches, CFC prices may soar. By 2000, &quot;it could belike gold,&quot; says ICI's Ms. Paterson. But she says industrycosts may also be goldplated, as CFC factories run belowplanned capacity. Currently, outside the U.S., where afederal tax on CFCs boosts prices and restrains industryprofits, the most common CFC chemicals sell for #1,000($1743) to #1,500 a metric ton.   Profits on ozone-friendly substitutes are even moreunpredictable, industry executives say. F.A. Tony VogelsbergJr., environmental manager at Du Pont's Freon productsdivision, says CFC substitutes could be more profitable,although prices will be high. And costs also will be steep,he adds, because most of the substitute chemicals require farmore complex production techniques.   Thus, unlike the CFC business where one company'stechnology has been much like another's, technology willdetermine how big each company's profits are, and whichcompanies will survive.</TEXT></DOC>
