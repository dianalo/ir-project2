Grace andamp; Co. posted a $560 million loss for the fourth quarter, reflecting asset write-downs and the expense of corporate staff reductions, and said it plans to shed its agricultural chemical business.    In the quarter, the diversified chemical company said it took a reserve of $369 million for a 40% cut in employees and a $221 million provision for the planned sale of its agricultural chemical operations.    Grace's loss compared with a profit of $44.7 million, or 41 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.    The write-downs in the latest quarter were partially offset by a net gain of $65 million from divesting itself of certain restaurant and retail operations. Sales rose 5.3% to $1.06 billion from about $1 billion.    J. Peter Grace, chairman, president and chief executive officer, called the past year the most turbulent in his 50 years with the company. &quot;The industries in which two of the company's four main businesses operate -- fertilizers and natural resources -- experienced severe depressions that were worse in 1986 than at any time in the history of those industries.&quot; Grace also has interests in specialty chemicals and consumer products.    The company said its agricultural chemical business, which produces nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers, posted a pre-tax loss of $84.1 million in 1986. The $221 million charge reflects the loss anticipated on divestment and the operating losses expected until the divestment is completed.    For the year, the company had a loss of $472.3 million, compared with a profit of $146.9 million, or $2.82 a share, in 1985. Sales from continuing operations for the full year rose 5%, to $3.73 billion.    Grace shares closed yesterday at $59, up $3.125, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
