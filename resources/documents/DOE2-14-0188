<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-14-0188 </DOCNO><TEXT>An investigation of the potential behavior of large amplitude nuclear-coupleddensity-wave oscillations in a boiling water reactor (BWR) was performed.A simplified, nonlinear BWR core model was developed and used to predictthe growth of oscillations as a limit cycle is approached. For high-power/low-flowinitial conditions, large density-wave oscillations could cause periodicpulses in core power. The fuel temperature, which rapidly increases athigh-power conditions and slowly recovers, is considered as the fastvariable in a relaxation oscillation. With an appropriate transformationof the system equations, the approximate limit cycle trajectory can thereforebe determined using singular perturbation analysis.</TEXT></DOC>
