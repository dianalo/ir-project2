SUAREZ</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former soldiers loyal to deposedPresident Ferdinand Marcos ransacked a military armory today butfailed to free soldiers jailed for involvement in past coupattempts, the military said.   Also today, the military said it filed murder and kidnappingcharges against a Swede, a West German and a Filipino of Germandescent who were accused of taking part in a rebel raid in February.   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, chief of the Philippine Constabulary,said the former soldiers fled with 24 stolen M-16 rifles whenguards fired at them as they tried to free some of the 160 people,mostly soldiers, detained at suburban Camp Crame.   He said his troops were ready for the attempted rescue of theprisoners because of intelligence reports earlier that ``Marcosloyalists'' would try to rescue Orlando Dulay, a former assemblymanclose to the former president, and other detainees.   Dulay has been jailed for more than a year on charges ofmasterminding the killing of several followers of President CorazonAquino during the campaign for the February 1986 presidentialelection. Mrs. Aquino was swept into power and Marcos was deposedduring the campaign.   The military, meanwhile, said charges were filed in a Quezoncivil court Friday against the Rev. Klaus Schmidt, 52, a WestGerman Protestant minister; Stellan Hermansson, 30, a Swede whoclaims to be a free-lance journalist; and Antonio Bosch, a Filipinobusinessman of German descent.   The three, arrested Wednesday, were accused of taking part in araid by communist New People's Army guerrillas on a town southeastof Manila in February in which two people were killed and twosoldiers abducted.   Montano linked participants in today's raid on Camp Crame toReynaldo Cabauatan, a pro-Marcos former major involved in a failedcoup attempt in January 1987. Montano based the conclusion on theattire of the raiders, who wore black hoods, fatigue pants, blackt-shirts with ``Black Forest Commando'' insignias and red arm bands.   Military units were placed on alert throughout the nation todaybut officials said the move was not related to the Camp Crameincident. They said it was a routine measure to prevent anydisruption of celebrations on Sunday _the 90th anniversary of thedeclaration of Philippine independence from Spain.   Constabulary spokesman Lt. Col. Cris Maralit said the Camp Crameraid began at 4 a.m. with the renegades riding in a white van and acar that apparently were parked inside the camp the day before.   It was not clear whether the raiders stayed overnight inside thecamp, the constabulary's national headquarters. Maralit said mostlikely they slipped in one by one during the night.   He said the renegades first ransacked the armory of theconstabulary's brass band and proceeded to the jail compound wherethey were spotted by sentries who fired on them.   The renegades immediately withdrew and were engaged in a brieffirefight by soldiers near the camp's gym, Maralit said.   He said an undetermined number of renegades were believed hit inthe exchange. There were no casualties on the government side.   Maralit said one soldier stationed at the raided armory wasbeing questioned for possible links to the raiders.   At least 34 detainees at Camp Crame are accused of involvementin at least five coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino's government.   Soldiers linked with Cabauatan, who remains at large since theJan. 27, 1987 failed coup, also attempted to free soldiers jailedat suburban Fort Bonifacio, the Philippine Army headquarters, inApril 1987.   One of the renegades was killed in the incident and the otherssurrendered after an eight-hour siege. At least 17 inmates, alsofacing coup charges, escaped but eventually surrendered or wererecaptured.</TEXT></DOC>
