In his monthly report, Eiichi Nakao, director-general of the Economic Planning Agency, assured other cabinet ministers at a meeting that the economy still remains healthy, despite this week's announcement of a 1% inflation-adjusted contraction in the April-June quarter from the previous three months.    The agency, in announcing the gross national product statistics Tuesday, said the export-slowing effect of the yen's upturn forced external demand to drag the economy down. The agency and private-sector economists agreed, however, that the decline in GNP, or the total output of goods and services, merely represented a reaction to the robust 2.7% quarter-to-qarter growth in the January-March period.    Mr. Nakao's report also said domestic demand continues to support the economy, and singled out strong personal spending and corporate equipment investment as the main driving force.    September was the 10th consecutive month in which the agency reported that the economy is in an expansionary stage.    According to the report, both manufacturers and nonmanufacturers have been stepping up investment to upgrade production and other equipment in anticipation of better business. This assessment was in line with the findings of a report released Wednesday by Japan Development Bank, a government-run financial institution. It said equipment investment by all industries in the year ending next March will climb 15.7% from the previous fiscal year.    The latest Economic Planning Agency report also noted that many Japanese companies, having overcome the effects of the yen's strength, expect profits to continue to grow.    It also said that personal consumption, the engine of growth accounting for more than 60% of GNP, has been increasing as a result of income growth and that its tone remains strong, despite an unseasonably cool summer this year that would have damped consumer spending.    Housing construction also hovers at high levels, though the pace of growth has slackened, according to the report.    On the country's labor market, the report pointed out that companies are looking for more employees. The ratio of job offers to job seekers, seasonally adjusted, stood at 1.05 in June and 1.09 in July, meaning that there were, respectively, 105 and 109 job offers for every 100 people looking for work. </TEXT></DOC>
