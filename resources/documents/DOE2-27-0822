<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-27-0822 </DOCNO><TEXT>A mass flow fuel injection control system is described for an internalcombustion engine having air intake means supplying combustion air tothe engine, and fuel injector means supplying fuel to the engine. Thecontrol system consists of: air flow velocity sensing means comprisingventuri means in the air intake means producing a pressure drop, andmeans measuring the differential pressure P/sub D/ between the absolutepressure outside of the venturi means and the reduced pressured in theventuri means, and means calculating the air air flow velocity as a functionof P/sub D/; means sensing the mass of the combustion air comprisingmeans measuring the absolute air pressure P/sub A/ outside of the venturimeans and temperature sensor means measuring air temperature T, and thecalculating air mass as a function of P/sub A/ and T; means responsiveto the air flow velocity sensor means and the air mass sensor means andcontrolling the fuel injector means; tachometer means for measuring enginespeed S, and variable resistance attenuator means responsive to the tachometermeans and connected to the air flow velocity sensing means and changingresistance with increasing engine speed such that air flow velocity sensingmeans divides P/sub D/ by a given power of S.</TEXT></DOC>
