The new technology was approved by a 7-0 vote following a publichearing crowded with more than 75 auto industry representatives andenvironmental advocates.   The advanced system, state officials said, would result inquicker repairs of defective parts, leading to lower emissions ofsmog-producing hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide.   Resulting reductions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides wouldamount to more than 100 tons a day apiece statewide, according to anair board staff report.   Almost half the reduction would be in the South Coast Air Basin,which includes Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardinocounties, the area that suffers the most polluted air in the nation.   The dashboard diagnostic system, which air board staff membersestimate could cost manufacturers $45 per vehicle, would have twopurposes: to improve air quality and to help mechanics repairhigh-tech auto equipment designed to monitor and limit noxiousemissions.   Air board engineering studies chief Steve Albu said it would havea ``greater impact on emissions than any other single controlmeasure adopted by the board.''   Among those supporting the new regulation were the South CoastAir Quality Management District, the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, the American Lung Association and the Automobile Club ofSouthern California.   Engineers for major auto makers said they like the idea ofexpanded on-board diagnostics but raised technical questions andrequested more time to devise the detection systems.   ``Due to the need to develop new, unproven technology,considerable lead-time is needed,'' said Suanne K. Thomas, a staffscientist for the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of theUnited States.   She said the association urged that implementation be delayeduntil the 1996 model year and phase-in be extended to the 1998 modelyear.   The manufacturers' group is a Detroit-based industry group thatincludes Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. The state board,however, decided to order the changes in 1994, with full complianceordered by 1996.   ``In the state of California, we have to be aggressive,'' saidJananne Sharpless, board chairman.   Board member John Lagarias said the dashboard system wouldprovide for ``smart warning lights'' as opposed to current ``idiotlights.''   On-board monitor lights the air board ordered on new carsbeginning in 1988 warn drivers they need repairs only when basicemission-related parts such as the fuel system fail to work.   The new system will require improved monitoring of the fuelsystem but also monitor engine misfiring, catalytic converterefficiency and chlorofluorocarbon leaks in air conditioning systems.   The regulation calls for on-board computers to store data thatwould help repairmen identify faulty equipment. It also calls forstandardized computer technology to allow a universal scanning toolso any repair shop can access the data in the vehicle computer.</TEXT></DOC>
