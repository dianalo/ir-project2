The estimated weighted-average margins are shown in the ``Suspensionof Liquidation'' section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Case History</ITAG>Since the notice of initiation on January 24, 1989 (54 FR 3516), the followingevents have occurred. On February 13, 1989, the ITC determined that thereis a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is threatenedwith material injury by reason of imports from Taiwan of SBTS (USITC Pub.No. 2156, February 1989).On February 9 and March 27, 1989, the Department's questionnaire was presentedto Taiwan Nitsuko Co., Ltd. (Taiwan Nitsuko) and Sun Moon Star Inc. (SunMoon Star). These two manufacturers account for a substantial portion ofexports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the periodof investigation (POI).On April 13, 1989, petitioners requested the preliminary determinationbe postponed. On April 27, 1989, in accordance with section 733(c)(i)(A)of the Act, we postponed the preliminary determination until July 26, 1989(54 FR 19211 May 4, 1989).On February 17, March 6, May 16 and May 17, 1989 we received replies tothe questionnaire from Taiwan Nitsuko. On March 3 and May 15, 1989 we receivedreplies to the questionnaire from Sun Moon Star.A number of supplemental and deficiency questionnaires were issued subsequentto May 15, 1989. Supplemental and deficiency responses were received fromthe respondents prior to this preliminary determination.On July 7, 1989, the Department initiated an investigation of Taiwan Nitsukounder the special rule for certain multinational corporations, section773(d) of the Act (the MNC provision). This initiation was based on informationprovided by petitioners in several submissions. We presented sections B(a),B(b), B, and D of the Department's MNC questionnaire to Taiwan Nitsuko.On July 11, 1989, Taiwan Nitsuko requested a one week extension to respondto section B(a) and B(b) of the Department's MNC questionnaire, which wegranted.On July 21, 1989, Taiwan Nitsuko submitted a letter declining to respondto sections B(a), B(b), B, and D of the Department's MNC questionnaire.<ITAG tagnum="84">The MNC Provision</ITAG>As noted above, the petitioners alleged that the MNC provision was applicablewith respect to Taiwan Nitsuko. Similar to the Department's practice withregard to sales below cost investigations, the Department did not automaticallyrequest data relevant to the MNC provision. Instead, the Department requiredpetitioners to present an adequate and timely allegation regarding theapplicability of the MNC provision. An adequate allegation is one thatgives the Department a basis for believing that the following criteriaexist:(1) Merchandise exported to the United States is being produced in facilitieswhich are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by a person, firmor corporation which also owns or controls, directly or indirectly, otherfacilities for the production of such or similar merchandise which ae locatedin another country or countries.(2) The sales of such or similar merchandise by the company concerned inthe home market of the exporting country are nonexistent or inadequateas a basis for comparison with the sales of the merchandise to the UnitedStates.(3) The foreign market value (FMV) of such or similar merchandise producedin one or more of the facilities outside the country of exportation ishigher than the foreign market value of such or similar merchandise producedin the facilities located in the country of exportation.(4) Because the Department bases its fair value comparisions on comparablemerchandise, any observed differences in FMV are not solely attributableto physical differences in merchandise.(5) Any observed differences in value between the FMV of products producedoutside the country of exportation and the FMV of products produced inthe country of exportation are not solely attributable to differences incosts of production, pursuant to the final paragraph of the MNC provision.There are two stages in an MNC investigation. In the first stage, the Departmentmust establish that the five criteria for applying the MNC provision aresatisfied (the same criteria as for initiating an MNC investigation). Inthe second stage, assuming the five criteria are met, the Department mustcalculate FMV by reference to the FMV of such or similar merchandise producedin facilities outside the country of exportation. This FMV must be adjustedfor differences in costs of production (including taxes, labor, materials,and overhead) between the country of exportation and the facilities outsidethe country of exportation.As noted above, the threshold for initiating an MNC investigation was metby petitioners. Consequently, we issued a questionnaire to Taiwan Nitsukoseeking additional data relevant to the MNC provision. However, TaiwanNitsuko declined to respond to this questionnaire. Therefore, as explainedbelow, the Department is using best information available (BIA) for TaiwanNitsuko in accordance with section 776(c) of the ACT.<ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation</ITAG>The POI is July 1, 1988, through December 31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of Customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(HTS), as provided for in section 1201 <T3>et. seq.</T3> of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption onor after this date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item numbers. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience andU.S. Customs Service purposes. The written description remains dispositive.The products covered by this investigation are certain small business telephonesystems and subassemblies thereof, currently classifiable under <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule</T3> item numbers 8517.30.2000, 8517.30.2500,8517.30.3000, 8517.10.0020, 8517.10.0040, 8517.10.0050, 8517.10.0070, 8517.10.0080,8517.90.1000, 8517.90.1500, 8517.90.3000, 8518.30.1000, 8504.40.0004, 8504.40.0008,8504.40.0010, 8517.81.0010, 8517.81.0020, 8517.90.4000, and 8504.40.0015.Prior to January 1, 1989, such merchandise was classifiable under items684.5710, 684.5720, 684.5730, 684.5805, 684.5810, 684.5815, 684.5825, 684.5830,682.6051, and 682.6053 of the <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated</T3> (TSUSA).Certain small business telephone systems and subassemblies thereof aretelephone systems, whether complete or incomplete, assembled or unassembled,with intercom or internal calling capability and total non-blocking portcapacities of between 2 and 256 ports, and discrete subassemblies designedfor use in such systems. A subassembly is ``designed'' for use in a smallbusiness telephone system if it functions to its full capability only whenoperated as part of a small business telephone system. These subassembliesare defined as follows:(1) Telephone sets and consoles, consisting of proprietary, corded telephonesets or consoles. A console has the ability to perform certain functionsincluding: answer all lines in the system; monitor the status of otherphone sets; and transfer calls. The term ``telephone sets and consoles''is defined to include any combination of two or more of the following items,when imported or shipped in the same container, with or without additionalapparatus: housing; hand set; cord (line or hand set); power supply; telephoneset circuit cards; console circuit cards.(2) Control and switching equipment, whether denominated as a key serviceunit, control unit, or cabinet/switch. ``Control and switching equipment''is defined to include the units described in the preceding sentence whichconsist of one or more circuit cards or modules (including backplane circuitcards) and one or more of the following items, when imported or shippedin the same container as the circuit cards or modules, with or withoutadditional apparatus: connectors to accept circuit cards or modules; buildingwiring.(3) Circuit cards and modules, including power supplies. These may be incorporatedinto control and switching equipment or telephone sets and consoles, orthey may be imported or shipped separately. A power supply converts ordivides input power of not more than 2400 watts into output power of notmore than 1800 watts supplying DC power of approximately 5 volts, 24 volts,and 48 volts, as well as 90 volt AC ringing capability.The following merchandise has been excluded from this investigation: (1)nonproprietary industry-standard (``tip/ring'') telephone sets and othersubassemblies that are not specifically designed for use in a covered system,even though a system may be adapted to use such nonproprietary equipmentto provide some system functions; (2) telephone answering machines or facsimilemachines integrated with telephone sets; and (3) adjunct software usedon external data processing equipment.We note that a number of ambiguities existed in the scope language previouslypublished in the Notice of Initiation with regard to the definition ofsubassemblies. We therefore have clarified the language describing thesubassemblies under investigation.In addition, the Department has received a number of inquiries regardingthe inclusion of dual use subassemblies within the scope of this invetigation.The Department defines dual use subassemblies as those subassemblies thatfunction to their full capability when operated as part of a large businesstelephone system as well as a small system. Because dual use subassembliesby definition are not subassemblies ``designed'' for use in small businesstelephone systems, dual use subassemblies are excluded from the scope ofthe investigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Such or Similar Comparisons</ITAG>For all respondent companies, pursuant to section 771(16)(C), we establishedfour categories of ``such or similar'' merchandise consisting of: (a) controland switching equipment, (b) circuit cards and modules, (c) telephone setsand consoles, and (d) complete small business telephone systems.Product comparisons were made using criteria which are ranked in orderof importance. For control and switching equipment we used the followingcriteria:(1) port capacity based on minimum operational configuration,(2) type of central microprocessor, (3) read-only memory (ROM) size. Forcircuit cards and modules we considered: (1) functions, (2) physical appearance.For telephone sets and consoles we considered: (1) number of buttons (regardlessof function) excluding dialpad, (2) number of individual visual indicators.For complete telephone systems, we made comparisons on the basis of thesimilarity of subassemblies, using the criteria described in the precedingsentences.Where there was no identical product in the home or third country marketwith which to compare a product imported into the United States, the mostsimilar product was compared on the basis of the characteristics describedabove. We made adjustments for differences in the physical characteristicsof the merchandise in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act.Consistent with our normal practice, when adjustments proved to be substantial,we used constructed value. In this case, we determined that an adjustmentgreater than 20 percent is substantial.In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of SBTS in thehome market to serve as the basis for calculating FMV, we compared thevolume of home market sales within each such or similar category to thevolume of third country sales within each respective such or similar category,in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.For Sun Moon Star, we determined that there were sufficient home marketsales to unrelated customers for three such or similar categories. Therewere no sales of complete small business telephone systems in the UnitedStates during the POI. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether sales of SBTS from Taiwan to the United States weremade at less than fair value, we compared the United States price to theforeign market value, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``ForeignMarket Value'' sections of this notice.Since Taiwan Nitsuko declined to provide information essential to our investigation,we used the best information available as required by section 776(c) ofthe Act. As best information available, we took the highest margin containedin the petition for products manufactured by Nitsuko Japan for each suchor similar category and averaged these figures to determine the marginfor Taiwan Nitsuko in this investigation. Taiwan Nitsuko declined to respond to the Department's MNC questionnaire.Because the MNC provision calls for the Department to calculate FMV withreference to merchandise produced in facilities outside the country ofexportation, we attemtped to compare the FMV in the petition for merchandiseproduced and sold in Japan with actual United States prices reported byTaiwan Nitsuko, for products produced in Taiwan and sold in the UnitedStates, or Taiwan Nitsuko U.S. sales prices provided in the petition. Sincethere were no sales for Taiwan Nitsuko reported in the petition and wewere unable to find comparable merchandise from Taiwan sold during thePOI, we used the margins calculated in the petition based on a comparisonof the FMV of merchandise produced and sold in Japan and the United Statesprice of merchandise produced in Japan and sold in the United States. Petitionersupplied information indicating that Taiwan Nitsuko and Nitsuko Japan producethe same products for sale in the United States and that these productsare sold at the same prices to the same single customer.For Sun Moon Star Inc., we compared the United States price to the foreignmarket value, as described below.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>Because virtually all sales by Sun Moon Star were made directly to unrelatedparties prior to importation into the United States, we based the UnitedStates price on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of theAct. We calculated purchase price based on packed f.o.b. Taiwan port prices.Gross unit price was based on the contract price plus the exchange rateadjustment as calculated by Sun Moon Star. Sun Moon Star made a furtherupward adjustment to gross unit price to account for early payment on futuresales. We made deductions where appropriate for inland freight and brokerageand handling. We added uncollected duties and value-added tax pursuantto andSection; 353.41(d) (ii) and (iii) of the Department's regulations publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 28, 1989 (54 FR 12742) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR andSection; 353.41).For Taiwan Nitsuko, we used information contained in the petition for UnitedStates price.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value</ITAG>In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue for Sun Moon Star based on home market sales, or constructed value,as appropriate. We calculated foreign market value based on the packed,delivered or ex-works prices to unrelated customers in the home market.We make deductions, where appropriate, for inland freight, discounts, advertisingand rebates. We deducted the home market packing costs from the foreignmarket value and added all U.S. packing costs. We make circumstance ofsale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in credit terms andwarranties. We made adjustments for indirect selling expenses and inventorycarrying costs in the home market to offset commissions paid in the UnitedStates in accordance with andSection; 353.56(b) of the Department's regulations.Where appropriate, we made further adjustments to the home market priceto account for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise,in accordance with andSection; 353.57 of the Department's regulations.We made an upward adjustment to tax-exclusive home market prices for thevalue added tax we computed for the United States price.For those products sold in the United States for which the difference inmerchandise adjustment between the reported home market product and theU.S. product was substantial, we calculated foreign market value basedon constructed value in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. In thiscase we determined that an adjustment greater than 20 percent is substantial.For Taiwan Nitsuko, we used information contained in the petition for FMV.<ITAG tagnum="84">Constructed Value</ITAG>In the situations described above, we calculated the constructed valuein accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. Except where noted below,the Department used the materials, fabrication, and general expenses basedon the respondent's submissions. We added U.S. packing, as reported bythe respondent.The Department analyzed the cost submissions of Sun Moon Star to determinethe sufficiency of such data for the purpose of calculating constructedvalue for the preliminary determination. The Department determined thatthe submission was substantially complete and sufficient and used the submissionfor the preliminary determination. However, adjustments to Sun Moon Star'sdata were made when it appeared from the explanation provided in the responsethat certain costs necessary for the production of the product under investigationwere not included or were not appropriately quantified or valued.For Sun Moon Star, constructed value was calculated on the basis of reportedmaterials and fabrication costs plus general expenses, profit, and importduties. Material cost was adjusted to agree with the supporting detailprovided by the respondent. General expenses exceeded the statutory minimumrequirement of ten percent of materials and fabrication. General expenseswere adjusted to reflect an allocation over cost of goods sold, which isin accordance with the Department's normal methodology. Financial expenseswere adjusted to reflect the interest expenses of the entire Sun Moon StarGroup. Interest income was not used to offset interest expense since theDepartment was unable to determine if the revenue was earned from short-terminvestments related to the current operations of the company. When imputedinventory and/or credit expenses are included in selling expenses, interestexpenses reflected on the company's books is reduced for a portion of theexpenses related to these activities in order to avoid double counting.The offset to interest expense for imputed credit and inventory carryingcosts was calculated using the Sun Moon Star Group nonconsolidated financialstatements. Since the respondent's profit calculation reflected less thaneight percent, the statutory minimum of eight percent was used.We made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differencesin credit terms, warranties, and advertising. We made adjustments for commissionspaid in the United States with indirect selling expenses and inventorycarrying costs in the home market in accordance with andSection; 353.56(a)(2)of the Department's regulations. For fair value comparisons, we made anupward adjustment to constructed value for the value-added tax we computedfor the United States price.<ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion</ITAG>We used the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of sale, inaccordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act, as amended by section 615of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. All currency conversions were madeat the rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in accordancewith andSection; 353.60 of the Department's regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify all informationused in reaching the final determination in this investigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>In accordance with section 773(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the U.S.Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of SBTS from Taiwan,except those produced by Sun Moon Star, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation''section of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>. The U.S. Customs Service shall require a cashdeposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amounts by which theforeign market value of the subject merchandise from Taiwan exceeds theUnited States price as shown below. This suspension of liquidation willremain in effect until further notice.
