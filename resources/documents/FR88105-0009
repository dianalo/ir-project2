The Office has decided to revise its requirementthat, to be recordable, a reproduction of a signed document must be accompaniedby a sworn certification signed by at least one of the persons who executedthe document, or by an authorized representative of that person. Underthe amended regulation, the required sworn certification need only be signedby a party to a document, or by an authorized representative of that person,regardless of whether the person actually signed the original document.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>January 5, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dorothy Schrader, General Counsel,Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Washington, DC 20559. Telephone:(202) 287-8380.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Section 205(a) of title 17 U.S.C. providesfor the recordation in the Copyright Office of any transfer of copyrightownership or other document pertaining to a copyright ``if the documentfiled for recordation bears the actual signature of the person who executedit, or if it is accompanied by a sworn or official certification that itis a true copy of the original, signed document.'' In implementing thisprovision, the Copyright Office adopted a regulation [37 CFR 201.4(c)(1)]requiring that ``[a]ny sworn certification accompanying a reproductionshall be signed by at least one of the persons who executed the document,or by an authorized representative of that person.'' On October 2, 1986(51 FR 35244), the Office published a notice of proposed rulemaking toadvise the public that it was considering the adoption of an amendmentto its regulations to permit the required sworn certification to be signedby a party to a document, regardless of whether that person actually signedthe original document. Interested parties were given until November 3,1986, to comment on the proposed amendment. Comments were received froma representative of the Association of American Publishers, Inc. (AAP)and the law firm of Brylawski, Cleary andamp; Leeds.Both parties commenting on the proposed amendment supported the directiontaken by the Copyright Office, but suggested that the proposed change didnot go far enough. The law firm asserted that, where the original, signeddocument is unavailable, there are many people capable of certifying areproduction as a true copy of the original. These persons would includean assignee or other successor in interest. The commentator urged thatat least the successor in interest to one of the parties to the originalsigned document be permitted to sign the required certification. The AAPalso suggested that the proposed amendment be expanded to cover successorsin interest to one of the original parties. The AAP observed that the proposal,while an improvement on the existing requirement, could lead to difficulties``where recordation is sought by a successor to the publisher (e.g., inthe case of a license, assignment, or business transfer of all or partof the subject matter covered by the document.'' The AAP noted that itis not uncommon that a party to the original document may no longer existor be unavailable.The Copyright Office, after reviewing the comments in light of the statutorypurpose of recordation concludes that it should not record documents onthe basis of copies attested to merely by a successor in interest. TheOffice is concerned about the authenticity of the recordations made pursuantto section 205, and has a responsibility to the public and the judicialsystem to guard against fraud. In cases where several transfers are interposedbetween the initial transaction and the point at which recordation is sought,the reliability of any bare assertion by a successor in interest is diminished.Finally since a successor in interest may submit for recordation the actualsigned document under which such person is claiming an interest in thecopyright, the Copyright Office is not persuaded of the need to reviseits proposal.The Office has been operating under its current regulation on recordationof transfers and other documents for nearly ten years. During this period,the Office has received few complaints concerning its certification requirement.The rule as proposed last year is an important departure from the existingprocedure. The Office will closely monitor the experience under this newcertification requirement to determine whether further amendment is required.The Copyright Office is also making a minor technical amendment to 37 CFR201.4(c)(1). The words ``full-size'' before facsimile reproductions arebeing deleted. The phrase is amended to read: ``a legible photocopy orother legible facsimile reproduction of the signed document.'' This changeis made in order to clarify the meaning of this requirement. ``Full-size''refers to the Copyright Office policy of refusing to accept microform copiesof documents for recordation, not whether a particular reproduction isthe same size as the document reproduced. The Copyright Office is not ina position to make such a determination. It is sufficient for a reproductionof a document to be capable of being read for purposes of examining andcataloging and being reproduced in legible microform copies. As providedin subparagraph (3) of andSection; 201.4(c), to be recordable, a document``must be legible and capable of being reproduced in legible microformcopies.'' Reproductions of documents must also meet this requirement.With respect to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Copyright Office takesthe position that this Act does not apply to Copyright Office rulemaking.This position is explained fully in the ``Supplementary Information'' accompanyingthe proposed rule. See 51 FR 35244. In the event it is later determinedby a court of competent jurisdiction that the Copyright Office is an ``agency''subject to that Act, the Register of Copyrights has determined that thisfinal regulation will have no significant impact on small businesses. Infact the amendment makes it easier to record documents.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 37 CFR Part 201</ITAG>Copyright, Recordation of copyright documents.In consideration of the foregoing, the Copyright Office is amending Part201 of 37 CFR, Chapter II.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 201_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
