<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-82-1101 </DOCNO><TEXT>The protection of property is central in the basic title to property anddemands that expropriation should be made subject to a particularly urgentinterest of the public and that the expropriation aims should be unequivocallydefined by the legislator, to warrant genuine weighing against privateor against other public concerns. Given that this holds, the author feelssection 79 of the Federal German Mining Law to be in contradiction withthe Constitutional Law: The legislator either has not defined the conditionsof admissibility at all or has defined them inappropriately. In thisway, private and other public concerns cannot be properly weighed againstmining interests. In the present case the question of whether the enterprisebenefitted by expropriation is rightfully so is decided by the administration,not the legislator. This undermines the protection of property. Otherareas of law are adversely affected. (orig./HSCH).</TEXT></DOC>
