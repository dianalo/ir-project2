Hundreds of foreign dignitaries, including Prime Minister LyndenPindling of the Bahamas, took part in the day's festivities.Military bands from the U.S., Britain, Scotland, France andVenezuela took part in the afternoon parade.   Prime Minister Eugenia Charles, the Caribbean's first woman primeminister, delivered an emotional Independence Day speech before acrowd of 8,000 people. Often interrupted by applause, the primeminister pledged to improve social and environmental conditions.   ``I declare 1989 the year of housing and the environment,'' saidthe prime minister.   Ms. Charles vowed to continue her fight against governmentcorruption and spoke loudly as she pronounced: ``You, the majorityof Dominicans have said `dealers, dealers' are gone. No matter howvocal they become and no matter what costume they wear, the greedyand lazy will not be allowed to plunder the public purse again.''   The parade also featured contingents from Dominica's policeforce. This nation of 100,000 people has no army, navy or air force.   The anniversary observance began with church services throughoutthe island, the largest and most northern of the Windward Islands,with Guadeloupe to the north and Martinique to the south.   During a morning service at the Roman Catholic Cathedral inRoseau, the capital, Bishop Arnold Bogheart said a theme for the dayshould be solidarity, including ``some form of meaningful unitarystatus'' among the seven English-speaking nations of theOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States.   The island states have been attempting to form a political unionever since the breakup of the West Indies Federation 30 years ago.   Dominica, which has had a stormy political past and is one of theleast developed countries in the Caribbean, is undergoing a majoreconomic reconstruction in a period of political stability.   The island gained independence from Britain on Nov. 3, 1978, andalmost immediately plunged into disorder after the former DominicaLabor Party government of Prime Minister Patrick John was implicatedin an unsuccessful invasion of Barbados led by mercenaries.   John was ousted amid popular disturbances in May 1979, and OliverSeraphine formed an interim government. But Seraphine's governmentalso was beset by scandals.   Shortly after the election of Ms. Charles and her DominicaFreedom Party in July 1980, the country went through a period ofkidnappings, murders and three unsuccessful coup attempts, one ofwhich resulted in the arrest of U.S. and Canadian mercenariesallegedly tied to the Ku Klux Klan.   In addition to political problems, the young nation has been hitby a series of hurricanes, including one in 1979 that destroyed 60percent of its crops and devastated transportation andcommunications.   The 69-year-old Ms. Charles, a conservative who was elected to asecond five-year term in July 1985, was a leading proponent of theU.S.-led invasion of Grenada in October 1983.   Most of Dominica's inhabitants are descendants of African slavesimported by planters in the 18th century. English is the officiallanguage, but most Dominicans speak a French-based creole,reflecting the country's French colonial heritage.</TEXT></DOC>
