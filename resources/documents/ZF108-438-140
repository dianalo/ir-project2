EDITORIALandM;Can Unix survive OSF?andP;  That's the question more than a few independentsoftware vendors are beginning to ask themselves.andM;Two years ago, the big question on every ISV's mind was which Unix it shoulduse to develop applications.andP;  It wasn't easy jumping into a software marketfor what was becoming a pseudo operating system standard.andP;  Unix was in dangerof becoming a generic, meaningless class name for myriad quasi-proprietaryoperating systems, from AIX to Xenix, loosely based on ATandamp;T's System V orBerkeley's system or a combination.andM;The paradigm that the Unix software market looked to was the DOS PC.andP;  Clonemanufacturers were legion, but the software market was neat and orderly.andO;Software came shrink-wrapped: &quot;One size fits all.&quot;andP;  All yearned for the daywhen vendors would fight it out between the Sparc, Mips and 88000architectures, but everyone believed all software was platform-neutral.andM;Then in May of 1988, DEC, IBM, Apollo, HP, Groupe Bull, Nixdorf and Siemensannounced the formation of an independent consortium to provide a standardsoftware environment: OSF.andP;  Jointly, the members would create source code andmake public their software specifications.andP;  The goal was an open environmentthat included application interfaces, advanced systems extensions and a newUnix operating system.andM;Although ATandamp;T and Sun weren't OSF members, many in the computer communityhailed the consortium and its charter to end the balkanization of Unix.andP;  Manythought open systems were the key to the future -- especially those who sawtheir future secure in a wide-open Unix software market, all primed toexplode with an awesome re-emergence of RISC technology.andM;But as we pointed out in an editorial shortly after its formation, the &quot;s&quot; inOSF stands for software, not systems.andP;  And it is just as improbable todaythat these fierce competitors are banding together for purely philanthropicreasons as it was two years ago.andP;  In its first bold and daring move, thecartel stunned many in the industry by standardizing on the Mach kernel fromCarnegie Mellon for OSF/1 and eliminating royalty payments to ATandamp;T.andM;Nonetheless, software doesn't stop at systems.andP;  Now OSF is pursuing itsDistributed Computing Environment, which ranges from remote procedure callson the first tier to a distributed file system on the second, all the way toPC integration services on the third.andP;  And ISVs are discovering that cartelsfix the prices that they will pay for goods as well as the goods that theyproduce.andM;For the ISV who finds that OSF is targeting his market niche, the choice issimple: respond to OSF's request for technology and hope his software will bechosen as the open standard.andP;  For this cooperation, he'll be paid a pittancefor his intellectual endeavors, his proprietary software will be made an openstandard, and he will go down in the annals of computer history as a hero ofthe people.andP;  What's the alternative?andP;  Take a reactionary stance, fight thetide of open systems, and try to sell his software at an honest price.andO;Meanwhile, his competitor's product will be given away as the open standard.andO;In short, OSF is inviting ISVs to play Russian roulette, but with a fullchamber.andM;There does remain one final question.andP;  How far can OSF go before some ISVfiles a lawsuit?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
