In Trying to apply a computer to askthat humans do, we often discover that it doesn't work.andP;  One common problemis that humans are able tod eal with fuzzy concepts, but computers arenot--they need precise representations and it is hard to represent a fuzzyconcept in a precise way.andP;  However, if we look closer at such tasks, we oftendiscover that the weakness actually lies not in the computer but inourselves--that we didn't understand what we were doing in the first place.andM;When faced with a problem of this sort, some people refuse to recognize theconceptual failure.andP;  Instead of seeking a better representation for the task,they thrash away at making the fuzzy scheme work, insisting that there isnothing wrong with the conceptual base.andM;I will illustrate one such problem with a true story.andP;  The central theme isthe fuzzy concept of a racial and ethnic classification, as used by the U.S.andO;government and a horde of other bureaucracies.andP;  These organizations have beencarrying out elaborate statistical computations and making major policydecisions based on this concept for many years with problematical results.andM;I begin with my first encounter with this scheme, some 25 years ago.andM;WHITE FACES IN NEW PLACESandM;In 1963, after living in Lexington, Massachusetts, for seven years, my familyand I moved to the Washington, D.C., area where I helped set up a new officefor Mitre Corporation.andP;  After three days of searching, we bought a house thenunder construction in a pleasant new suburb called Mantua Hills, nearFairfax, Virginia.andP;  I hadn't noticed it during our search, but it soon becameevident that there were nothing but white faces in that area.andP;  In fact, therewere nothing but white faces for miles around.andM;We expected to find some cultural differences and did.andP;  For example, peopledrove much less aggressively than in Massachusetts.andP;  The first time that Idid a Boston-style bluff at a traffic circle, the other cars yielded!andP;  Thistook all the fun out of it and I was embarassed into driving moreconservatively.andM;When I applied for a Virginia driver's license.andP;  I noticed that the secondquestion on the application, just after &quot;Name,&quot; was &quot;Race.&quot;andP;  When filling outforms, I have always made it a practice to omit information that I think isirrelevant.andP;  It seemed to me that race had nothing to do with driving a car,so I left it blank.andM;When I handed the application to the clerk along with the fee, he just lookedat me, marked W in the blank field and threw it on a stack.andP;  I guess he hadlearned that that was the easiest way to dealwith outlanders.andM;It soon became apparent that the second question on all forms in Virginia was&quot;Race,&quot; right after &quot;Name.&quot;andP;  Someone informed me that as far as theCommonwealth of Virginia was concerned, there were just two races: &quot;white&quot;and &quot;colored.&quot;andP;  Included in colored were all dark-skinned people, includingboth kinds of Indians.andP;  I felt uncomfortable with this system, knowing thatit was part of a scheme of legal discrimination that still pervaded the lawsof many states.andP;  For example, it was still illegal in Virginia for a whiteand a colored person to marry.andM;Our contractor was a bit slow in finishing the house.andP;  We knew that our mailwas probably accumulating in the post office, so we put up the mailbox evenbefore the house was finished.andP;  The first day we got just two letters--fromthe American Civil Liberties Union and Martin Luther King's organization,SCLC.andP;  We figured that this was the postman's way of letting us know that hewas on to us.andP;  Sure enough, the next day we got the rest of our accumulatedmail, a large stack.andM;When our kids brought forms home from school, I started putting a C after thesecond question, leaving it to the authorities to figure out whether thatmeant Colored or Caucausian.andP;  I dout that this ploy actually confusedanyone--the entire school was lily white.andM;RACING CLEARANCEandM;About this time, my boss and I and another colleague applied for a specialsecurity clearance that we needed.andP;  Certain clearances can't be named inpublic--it was one of those.andP;  Since I had held an ordinary Top Secretclearance for a number of years and had held the unnamable clearance a shorttime before, I did not anticipate any problems.andM;When I filled out my personal history form, I noticed that question 5 was&quot;Race.&quot;andP;  In the past I had not paid attention to this question; I justthoughtlessly wrote &quot;Caucasian.&quot;andP;  Having been sensitized by my newenvironment, I reexamined the question.andM;All of my known forebears came from Europe, mostly from Bavaria and Bohemia,with a few from England, Ireland, and Scotland.andP;  A glance in the mirror,however, indicated that there was Middle Eastern blood in my veins.andP;  I have asemitic nose and skin that tans so easily that I am often darker than manypeople who pass for Black.andP;  Did I inherit this from a Hebrew, an Arab, aGypsy or perhaps one of the Turks who periodically pillaged Central Europe?andO;Maybe it was from a Blackfoot Indian that an imaginative aunt thinks was inour family tree.andP;  I will probably never know.andM;As an arrogant young computer scientist, I believed that if you can't figureout how to program a decision, the question must be wrong.andP;  I couldn't figureout how to program racial classification, so I concluded that there isn't asuch a thing.andM;I subsequently reviewed some scientific literature that confirmed thisimpression.andP;  &quot;Race&quot; is, at best, a fuzzy concept about typical physicalcharacteristics of certain populations.andP;  At worst, of course, it provides abasis for more contemptible conduct than any concept other than religion.andM;In answer to the race question on the security form, I decided to put&quot;mongrel.&quot;andP;  It would have been slightly less provocative had I said &quot;human,&quot;but I've always enjoyed diddling forms a bit.andM;Shortly after I handed in the form, I received a call from a secretary in thesecurity office of the Defense Communications Agency.andP;  She said that she hadnoticed a typographical error in the fifth question where it said &quot;mongrel.&quot;andO;She asked if I didn't mean &quot;Mongol.&quot;andP;  &quot;No thanks,&quot; I said, &quot;I really meant'mongrel.'&quot;  She ended the conversation rather quickly.andM;A few hours later I received a call from the chief security officer of theD.C.A., whom I happened to know.andP;  &quot;Hey, Les,&quot; he said in a friendly way, &quot;I'dlike to talk to you the next time you're over here.&quot;andP;  I agreed to see himlater that week.andM;When I got there, he tried to talk me out of answering the race question&quot;incorrectly.&quot;andP;  I asked him what he thought the right answer was.andP;  &quot;You know,Caucasian,&quot; he replied.andP;  &quot;Oh, you mean someone from the Caucasus Mountains ofthe U.S.S.R.?&quot;andP;  I asked pointedly.andP;  &quot;No, you know, 'White.'&quot;  &quot;Actually, Idon't know,&quot; I said.andM;We got into a lengthy discussion in which he informed me that as far as theDefense Department was concerned there were five races: Caucasian, Negro,Oriental, American Indian, and Pacific Islander.andP;  I asked him how he wouldclassify someone who was, by his definition, 7/8 Caucasian and 1/8 Negro.andP;  Hesaid he wasn't sure.andP;  I asked how he classified Egyptians and Ethiopians.andP;  Hewasn't sure.andM;I said that I wasn't sure either and that &quot;mongrel&quot; seemed like the bestanswer for me.andP;  He finally agreed to forward my form to the securityauthorities, but warned that I was asking for trouble.andM;A QUESTION OF STABILITYandM;I knew what to expect from a security background investigation: neighbors andformer acquainstances let you know it is going on by asking &quot;What are theytrying to get you for?&quot; and kiddin gyou about what they told theinvestigators.andP;  Within a week after my application for the new clearance wassubmitted, it became apparent that the investigation was already underway andthat the agents were hammering everyone they talked to about my &quot;mentalstability.&quot;andM;Gale, the personnel manager where I worked, was interviewed quite early andcame to me saying, &quot;My God!andP;  They think you're crazy! What did you do, rape apolo pony?&quot;andP;  He also remarked that they had asked him if he knew me sociallyand that he had answered &quot;Yes, we just celebrated Guy Fawkes Day together.&quot;andO;When the investigator wanted to know what Guy Fawkes Day is, he started toexplain the gunpowder plot but thought better of it.andP;  He settled for theexplanation, &quot;It's a British holiday.&quot;andM;An artist friend named Linda, who lived two houses away from us, told my wifethat she had no trouble answering the investigator's questions about mystability.andP;  She said that she recalled our party the week before when we hadformed two teams to play &quot;walk the plank.&quot;andP;  In this game, participants taketurns walking the length of a 2 x 4 set on edge and drinking a small amountof beer.andP;  Anyone who steps off is eliminated and the team with the most totalcrossings after some number of rounds wins.andP;  Linda said that she remembered Iwas one of the more stable participants.andM;I was glad that she had not remembered my instability at an earlier party ofhers when I broke my watch and bruised my ribs in a fall off a skateboard.andO;The embarrassing cause of the accident was that I had run over the bottom ofmy own toga!andM;Meanwhile, the investigation continued full tilt everywhere I had lived.andO;After about three months it stoped and short time later I learned that theclearance had been granted.andP;  The other two people whose investigations werebegun at the same time did not receive their clearances until several monthslater.andM;In comparing notes, it appeared that the investigators did the backgroundchecks on my colleagues in a much more leisurely manner.andP;  We concluded thatmy application had received priority treatment.andP;  The investigators had donetheir best to pin something on me and, having failed, gave me the clearance.andM;The lesson is clear: if you want a clearance in a hurry, put something onyour history form that will make the investigators suspicious, but that isnot damning.andP;  They get so many dull backgrounds to check that they relish thepossibility of actually nailing someone.andP;  By being a bit provocative, youdraw priority attention and get quicker service.andM;After I received the clearance, I expected no further effects from myprovocative answer.andP;  As it turned out, there was an unexpected repercussion ayear later and an unexpected victory the year after that.andP;  The repercussionturned out to be an odd side effect of a new computer application.andM;MONGREL IN A STAR CHAMBERandM;About a year after I had been granted the supplementary security clearance, Ireceived a certified letter directing me to report to the Air Force Office ofSpecial Investigations at Suitland, Maryland very early in the morning acertain day a month later.andP;  To one whose brain seldom functions before 10a.m., this was singularly unappealing trip request.andM;My wife somehow got me up early on the appointed day and I drove a off in myTR-3 with the top down, even though it was a cold winter morning.andP;  I hopedthat the air would stimulate my transition to an awakened state.andM;When I arrived and identified myself, I was immediately ushered into a longnarrow room with venetian blinds on one side turned to block the meagermorning light.andP;  I was seated on one side of a table on which there were twogoose-neck lamps directed into my eyes.andP;  There was no other light in theroom, so I could barely see the three inquisitors who took positions on theopposite side of the table.andM;Someone punched on a tape recorder and the trio began taking turns at pokingintomy past.andP;  They appeared to be trying to convince me that I wasin deeptrouble.andP;  While the pace and tone of their questions were clearly aimed atintimidation, they showed surprisingly little interest in my answers.andP;  Imanaged to stay relaxed, partly because I was not yet fully awake.andM;They asked whether I had any association with a certain professor at SanDiego State College, which I had attended for one year.andP;  The professor hadbeen harrassed by the House Un-American Activities Committee during theMcCarthy Era.andP;  He was an alleged Communist.andP;  I answered that I did not knowhim, but that I might have met him socially since he and my mother were onthe faculty concurrently.andP;  They wanted to know with certainty whether I hadtaken any classes from him.andP;  I said that I had not.andM;They next wanted to know how well I knew Linus Pauling, whom they knew was aprofessor at Caltech when I was a student there.andP;  I acknowledged that he wasmy freshman chemistry professor and that I had visited his home once ortwice.andP;  I did not mention that Pauling's lectures had so inspired me that Idecided to become a chemist.andP;  It was not until I took a sophomore course inphysical chemistry that I realized I wasn't cut out for it.andP;  I recalled thatPauling had been regularly harassed by certain government agencies during theMcCarthy Era because of his leftist &quot;peacenik&quot; views.andP;  He was barred fromoverseas travel on occasion and the harassment continued even after he wonthe Nobel Prize in chemistry, but seemed to diminish after the second one,the Peace Prize.andM;The inquisitors wanted to know how often I got together with one of my uncleswho lived nearby.andP;  I acknowledged that we met occasionally, and that ourfamilies had dined together a short time earlier.andP;  It sounded as though theythought they had something on him.andP;  I knew him to be a very able person witha distinguished career in public service.andP;  He had been City Manager of FortLauderdale and several other cities and had held a number of positions in theState Department.andP;  It occurred to me that they might be planning to nail himfor associating with a known mongrel.andM;The questions continued in this vein for hours without a break.andP;  I keptwaiting for them to bring up a Caltech acquainstance named Bernon Mitchell,who had lived in the same student house as me.andP;  Mitchell had later taken aposition at the National Security Agency, working in a cryptography, thendefected to the Soviet Union with a fellow employee.andP;  They were apparentlycloset gays.andM;In fact, the inquisitors never mentioned Mitchell.andP;  This suggested that theymay not have done a very thorough investigation.andP;  A more likely explanationwas that Mitchell and his boyfriend represented a serious failure of thesecurity clearance establishment--one they would rather not talk about.andM;After about three and a half hours of nonstop questioning I began to wake up.andO;I was also began to get riled over their seemingly endless fishingexpedition.andP;  At this point there was a short pause and a rustling of papers.andO;I sensed that they were finally getting around to the main course.andM;&quot;We note that on your history form you claim to be a mongrel,&quot; said the manin the middle.andP;  &quot;What makes you think you are a mongrel?&quot;andP;  &quot;That seems to bethe best available answer to an ill-defined question,&quot; I responded.andP;  We beganan exchange that was very much like my earlier discussion with the securityofficer in the Defense Communications Agency.andP;  As before, I asked how theyidentified various racial groups and how they classified people who weremixturesof these &quot;races.&quot;andM;The interrogators seemed to be taken aback at my asking them questions.andP;  Theyasked why I was trying to make trouble.andP;  I asked them why they would notanswer my questions.andP;  When no answers were forthcoming, I finally pointed outthat it was clear that they did notknow how to determine the raceof any givenperson, so it was unreasonable for them to expect me to.andM;The interrogators began whispering among themselves.andP;  They had apparentlyplanned to force me to admit my true race and were not prepared for analternative outcome.andP;  Finally, the man in the center spoke up saying, &quot;Areyou willin gto sign a sworn statement about your race?&quot;andP;  Certainly,&quot; I said.andO;They then turned up the lights and called for a stenographer.andM;She appeared with notebook in hand and I dictated a statement: &quot;I declarethat to the best of my knowledge I am a mongrel.&quot;andP;  &quot;Don't you think youshould saymore than that,&quot; said the chief interrogator.andP;  &quot;I think that coversit,&quot; I replied.andP;  The stenographer shrugged and went off to type thestatement.andM;With the main business out of the way, things lightened up--literally.andP;  Theyopened the venetian blinds to let in some sunlight and offered me a cup ofcoffee, which I accepted.andP;  We had some friendly conversation, then I signedthe typed statement, which was duly notarized.andM;PUNCH LINEandM;My former tormentors now seemed slightly apologetic about the whole affair.andO;I asked them what had prompted this investigation.andP;  After some glances backand forth, one of them admitted that they were putting their clearancedatabase on IBM cards and found that there was no punch for &quot;mongrel.&quot;andM;I thought about this for a moment, then asked why they didn't add a newpunch.andP;  &quot;We don't have any programmers here,&quot; was the answer, &quot;We got theprogram from another agency.&quot;andM;I said, &quot;Surely I am not the onlyperson to give a nonstandard answer.andP;  Withall the civil rights activists now in government service, some of them musthave at least refused to answer the race question.&quot;andP;  The atmosphere becamenoticeably chillier as on eof them answered, with clinched teeth, &quot;You're theonly one.andP;  The rest of those people seem to know their race.&quot;andM;I was surprised to learn that nearly everyone believed in the concept ofracial classification.andP;  It appeared that even people who were victims ofdiscrimination acknowledged it as part of their identity.andM;Clearly the security people believed I ahd caused this problem, but I feltthat it was the result of a stupid question and the common programmer'sblunder of creating a categorization that does not include &quot;other as anoption.andM;They apparently found it impractical to obtain the hour or two of aprogrammer's time that would have been needed to fix the computer program, sothey chose instead to work with their standard tools.andP;  This led to anexpenditure of hundreds of man-hours of effort in gathering information totry to intimidate me into changing my answer.andM;Some important political developments occurred during the period between myrapid security clearance and the later inquisition.andP;  Civil rights workersfrom all over the country worked on voter registration in the South.andP;  Threeof them disappeared near Philadelphia, Mississippi, on June 22, 1964 and werelater found to have been murdered by local officials.andM;A federal omnibus civil rights act happened to be signed into law one weeklater.andP;  It banned discrimination in voting, jobs, and public accommodationsand generally removed the last vestiges of legal support for racialdiscrimination at the national level.andM;I never found out how the security investigators coped with the fact that Iremained a mongrel, but in 1966 I discovered that something very good hadhappened: the race question had disappeared from the security clearance form.andO;In fact, this question disappeared from nearly all governmental forms then.andO;I liked to think that I helped that change along.andM;FEELING NAKED WITHOUT CHAINSandM;For a short period in the mid-1960s, just after the race question disappearedfrom the forms, it became socially unacceptable in certain circles to talkabout a person's race, but then an odd thing happened.andP;  Those who had beendiscriminated against for so long began to think of their racial identity assomething to be proud of and those who wished to end discrimination decidedthat they needed to classify people into racial groups in order to be able tostatiscally measure compliance with antidiscrimination laws and to activelyright earlier wrongs.andM;In support of the latter goals, government bureaucrats invented an &quot;ethnic&quot;classification system that identified the minorities that they felt might bediscriminated against.andP;  They never bothered to define their terms because,like the earlier racists, they had only a hazy notion of where the boundarieswere.andP;  Thus, the fuzzy old concept of racial classification that had been atool of racists for so long came to be embraced by their former victims andthose who believed you had to classify everyone and compile statistics tocombat discrimination.andM;Beginning in 1965, I helped John McCarthy organize the the StanfordArtificial Intelligence Laboratory and remained as principal bureaucrat ofthat organization for 15 years.andP;  My first encounter with the newclassification system was in the late 1960s, when I received a form thatcalled for a matrix of numbers to be filled in for thelab, with job levels inone dimension and ethnic and sex classifications running the other way.andP;  Theclassifications made no more sense to me that those used by the armedservices earlier, but being at a place like Stanford gave me access to expertadvice on a wide range of subjects, so I decided to seek help.andM;I happened to know Joshua Lederberg, who had received a Nobel Prize for hiswork in genetics.andP;  This seemed to qualify him as an expert, so I asked himhow he determined the ethnic classes of his staff members.andP;  Josh laughed andsaid, &quot;That classification is nonsensical.andP;  I just let them choose whateverthey would like to be.&quot;andM;It sounded like good advice, but a problem arose when I applied it.andP;  Amongthe listed ethnic classes were &quot;Spanish surname&quot; and &quot;Black,&quot; but one of mysecretaries happened to be black and had a spanish surname.andP;  She felt thatshe should be listed in both places.andP;  I did as she requested, which meantthat the rows and columns of the matrix didn't add up right.andP;  I left it thatway just to see what would happen.andP;  I never heard a word about it.andM;THE ETHNIC EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHESandM;After a few years of having us fill out ethnic matrices, somebody in theStanford administration figured out that they could save a lot of fuss bysimply adding ethnic classifications to their personnel database, so that thecompute could generate all the statistics that the government might want.andO;Furthermore, the rows and columns of computer-synthesized matrices wouldalways add up correctly--truly a conceptual breakthrough!andP;  Thus was born theidea of adding individual ethnic codes to the IBM cards that contained ourpersonal data.andP;  Sound familiar?andM;The Stamford administration managed to avoid one mistake that the DefenseDepartment security folks had made: they didn't ask anyone to classifythemselves, thus bypassing troublemakers like me.andP;  Everyone was secretlyclassified by certain key administrators.andP;  These administrators must havebeen remarkably well-trained, because they did their classifying just bylooking at people--I never found anyone who was interviewed to determinetheir ethnic classification.andM;I later obtained a copy of the instructions for determining new ethnic code.andO;Here is the full text.andP;  ETHNIC CODE Required for all employees.andP;  The codesare:andM;(1) Black, not of Hispanic originandM;(2) Asian or Pacific Islander (persons having origins in any of the originalpeoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, or thePacific Islands)andM;(3) American Indian or Alaskan nativeandM;(4) Hispanic (persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban Central or SouthAmerican or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race)andM;(5) Nonminority (persons having origins in any of the original peples ofEurope, North Africa, or the Middle East.)andM;I learned that this classification scheme came from the fedderal government.andO;I believe that it is still in use throughout the United States today.andM;Interestingly, there were still five categories, just as the security folksclaimed in the early 1960s, but the categories had shifted.andP;  I was glad tosee that the problem with Hispanic blacks had been solved, but there werestill some mysteries.andM;According to the definitions, people from Spain were both code 4 and code 5.andO;Were we to assume that 4 takes precedence over 5?andP;  Not clear.andM;Once again, there was no code for &quot;mongrel&quot; or &quot;undefined&quot; or &quot;mixed&quot; or&quot;other.&quot;andP;  &quot;Nonminorityc is defined as people from certain specific parts ofthe world and so it does not function as the &quot;other&quot; category.andP;  The designersof this system obviously believed that everyone belonged to some uniqueethnic category, but they didn't describe exactly how to put them there.andM;In fact, there were no instructions given on how to classify people who aremixtures of things.andP;  For example, where would I place my three grandchildrenwho are half Yup'ik Eskimo and half whatever we are?andP;  They were born inAlaska, so I guess that they qualify as &quot;Alaskan Native&quot; (Code 3).andM;I believe that the failure of this ethnic code to deal with people of mixedorigins is not accidental.andP;  It is part of a persistent conspiracy in theUnited States to deny that there are such people.andP;  Instead of beingaccurately identified, they are forced to choose membership in one of thetraditional racial groups.andP;  Needless to say, there are no reliable statisticson the number of such people, but it is certainly very large and gettinglarger.andM;&quot;BLACK&quot; AND &quot;WHITE&quot; ARE RELATIVEandM;We know that nearly all of the people in the United States who callthemselves &quot;black&quot; are genetic mixtures of African and European peoples.andO;Because our culture is predominently European, anyone who has detectablyAfrican features is called black, even if they are genetically, say, 7/8European.andP;  If we were a predominently African country, these same peoplewould likely be called &quot;white&quot; because they have detectably Europeanfeatures.andP;  In other words, these racial classifications seem to be maderelative to the norm, which makes them intrinsically subjective and ratherunreliable.andM;I understand that South Africa, which has an African majority and a dominantEuropean culture, distinguishes between Black, White, Asian, and Colored, thelast being the catchall for mongrels.andP;  Although I find their racial policiesabominable, their racial classification system is slightly more logical thanours; of course, it, too, is senseless if you examine it more closely.andM;Sometime after Stanford undertook the secret ethnic classification project, Isaw one of my personnel forms and discovered that I was code 5.andP;  I seriouslyconsidered protesting.andP;  After all, some of my ancestors were Huns, a fiercenomadic tribe of Asian warriors.andP;  In the fifth century A.D., under theleadership of Attila, they swept over most of Asia and Europe as far West asGaul, raping, pillaging, and spreading their genes everywhere.andP;  Thus Iqualify as code 2.andM;On the other hand, based on the best available anthropological evidence, wecan all trace our ancestry back to Africa at an earlier time.andP;  Thus if&quot;Black&quot; means anyone whose ancetors came from sub-Sahara Africa, we allqualify as code 1.andM;While it was clear that logic would be on my side if I made a fuss over myethnic code, I had to consider the potential consequences of such an action.andO;One possibility was that I would have another run-in with the ethnic police.andO;I figured that I could handle that.andP;  On the other hand, I had become olderand, presumably, wiser and did not wish to expend energy on hopelesscrusades.andP;  Since everyone else seemed to believein this absurd scheme.andP;  Ifinally decided to live with the shame of being a code 5 nonminority.andM;WHAT ARE WE DOING HEREandM;&quot;So what?&quot; you may say, &quot;Nobody takes this ethnic stuff seriously anyway.&quot;andO;Wrong!andP;  Ethnic codes determine eligibility fro certain scholarships and whichschools our children are bussed to.andP;  Large employers must exhibit ethnicstatistics within certain ranges in order to avoid charges of discrimination.andO;Under some Affirmative Action programs approved by the courts, people who areidentified as members of certain ethnic groups are given hiring or promotionpreferences, supposedly to rectify past discrimination.andP;  If you own abusiness, your ethniccode determines your eligibility for certain kinds oflow interest loans and may give you preferential access to many kinds ofgovernment contracts.andP;  And so forth.andM;I have made fun of racial and ethnic classification systems not because Idisagree with the goals of those who have created these schemes (even thoughI do disagree in some cases), but because our society as a whole continues totreat these schemes as if they had substance, somehow ignoring the fact thatthey are, and have always been, nonsense.andP;  We continue to build ever moreelaborate bureacratic structures atop this rotten foundation.andM;Suppose we continue building, presumably because it is for a good cause.andP;  Doyou think that these structures will be dismantled once the origional purposehas vanished or has been forgotten?andP;  From what I know of the waybureaucracies work, I am sure that the answer is &quot;No.&quot;andP;  Fighting racism with&quot;benign&quot; racism leads to indefinite racism that will end only when anotherprocess intervenes.andP;  Something will eventually intervene, as I discuss later,but it seems silly to wait that long.andM;PROBLEMS AND ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONSandM;Great progress in reducing racial discrimination has been made during mylifetime.andP;  I grew up in a racist society that had laws prohibiting blacks inthe South from eating in the same restaurants, attending the same schools,using the same restrooms, drinking from the same foundations, riding in thesame part of a bus or train, sitting in the same part of theaters, orentering the same public parks as whites.andP;  I attended public high school inLouisville, Kentucky, where we were segregated three ways: white boys, whitegirls, and colored.andM;Job discrimination pervaded all of the United States, not just the South.andO;Almost the only jobs open to blacks, who were then called &quot;negro&quot; or&quot;colored&quot; or something more derogatory, were as cooks, domestic servants, orbootblacks.andP;  Professional sports were closed to them and few could get jobsin the entertainment industry.andM;Earlier, when I lived in San Diego, some acquaintances who happened to bemembers of a &quot;dangerous&quot; race were rounded up by the government and placed inconcentration camps, though at the time I was not aware of what had happenedto them--my parents told me that they had &quot;moved away.&quot;andP;  Only recent have welearned of atrocities that happened in those camps, such as the elderly manwho went outside the fence to retrieve a ball that had been thrown there byhis grandson and was machine-gunned to death by a guard.andM;We can take some pride in the fact that our government did not systematicallymurder people in our concentration camps, but then neither did the Germans inthe beginning.andP;  I shudder to think what might have happened if our war in thePacific had gone badly.andP;  U.S.andP;  government propaganda had already convincedmost citizens that Japanese were a subhuman species who bred themselves toserve the Japanese national purpose by flying kamikaze missions or otherwiseserving as cannon fodder and that one of our national goals was to &quot;KillJaps!&quot;andM;Some of these prejudicial feelings seem to have resurfaced recently inresponse to Japanese economic success.andP;  Nevertheless, we seem to have madesubstantial progress in eradicating prejudice and discrimination during thelast 40 years.andP;  Still, it is clear that this problem is not solved.andM;My vision of the future is a colorblind society.andP;  I know that we will notreach it in my lifetime because old habits die hard.andP;  In fact, I think thatwe will never entirely escape this problem because of a peculiarity of humannature: wherever there are distinguishable groups of people, tribal instinctscan take root and turn it into an &quot;us versus them&quot; situation.andP;  Thisphenomenon is not just racially based--if you have any doubt, attend a highschool basketball game and observe the fans on both sides.andM;There was a short time in the mid-1960s when I thought we were headed in theright direction.andP;  Essentially all of the legal underpinnings of racialdiscrimination had been knocked out of the law books.andP;  Then certainantidiscrimination forces mobilized, claiming that it was insufficient tosimply outlaw discrimination.andP;  They believed that it was also necessary tomeasure it statistically by classifying everyone.andM;I disagree.andP;  I think that all the important issues can be addressed withoutresorting to the absurd exercise of trying to assign ethnic codes toeveryone.andP;  For example, one way to homogenize school composition is to assignstudents in some area to schools in that area in accordance with a randomnumber generator.andP;  This would achieve racial balance without resorting toclassification foolishness.andM;The most direct way to fight discrimination in housing or employment is tosend a well-qualified minority applicant to a suspect and, if the applicantis refused, send a less well-qualified majority applicant.andP;  If that person isaccepted, repeat the experiment once or twice to be sure, then nail them!andO;This scheme has been teste and it works.andM;BACK TO BASICSandM;Please understand that I do not claim that the concept of race is totallymeaningless.andP;  People from certain parts of the world do bear physicalsimilarities to one another and racial terms are sometimes useful as labelsfor those similarities, provided that we do not pretend that these terms havewell-defined meanings.andP;  Ashley Montagu and others have pointed out that mostpopular racial concepts are, in fact, myths.andP;  What is truly nonsensical is toturn the fuzzy concept of race around and and try to classify all individualsas being members of some particular race.andM;Also, I do not claim that there necessarily have to be logicalinconsistencies in racial and ethnic codes, though all that I have seen todate do exhibit such properties.andP;  Simply including a &quot;mixed blood&quot; or&quot;mongrel&quot; category would solve a lot of problems, but for some reason thatidea does not seem to occur to most people who design these codes.andM;Though many people clearly believe that racial and ethnic classifications aresomehow linked to science, I observe that their relationship to genetics is alot like astrology's link to astronomy.andP;  The analogyis imperfect, however;very few government officials are willing to publicly admit that they plantheir lives around astrology (though some apparently do), but nearly all ofthem publicly plan their programs around ethnic classifications.andP;  Indeed, thegovernment pours millions of dollars each year into reaffirmation of thisbelief and requires that private industry join in the massive delusion.andM;The widespread delusion about racial and ethnic classification has not beenconfined to the nonscientific world, unfortunately.andP;  As Lancelot Hogbenremarked 56 years ago: &quot;Geneticists believe that anthopologists have decidedwhat a race is.andP;  Ethnologists assume that their classifications embodyprinciples which genetic science has proved to be correct.andP;  Politiciansbelieve that their prejudices have the sanction of genetic laws and thefindings of physical anthroplogy to sustain them.&quot;andM;While there often are visible differences between people from areas that arewidely separated, these differences are very small compared with the physicalsimilarities of all humans.andP;  Genetic studies indicate that all modern humansevolved from a single population about 100,000 years ago, or possibly lessthan half that time.andP;  On the evolutionary time scale, this is a very shortperiod.andM;As these people spread out, the genetic compositions of widely separatedgroups moved apart to some degree, but there have always been gradations andmixtures of characteristics in between them; in other words, there are noclear boundaries between groups.andP;  Europeans and Africans are geneticallysomewhat closer to each other than to their cousins in the Far East, butthere are all kinds of variations in between.andM;Some of the geographical variations in human characteristics appear to beenvironmental adaptations.andP;  For example, having a relatively large amount ofmelanin in the skin not only makes it dark but also protects against intensesolar radiation, which reduces the frequency of skin cancer andother skindisorders.andP;  On the other hand, having very fair skin facilitates theabsorbtion of sunight and the production of vitamin D, which inhibits ricketsand other diseases.andP;  Thus, the Nordic complexion is well-suited to life atthe higher latitudes where there is less sunlight available.andP;  Some people'sskin bleaches out if it is not exposed to much sun or becomes very dark if itis.andP;  This adaptation would have been useful to nomadic groups thatperiodically migrated from one zone to the other.andM;Other interpretations of visible differences in people are more speculative.andO;The semitic nose, for example, has a larger moist interior that could beadvantageous when breathing hot, arid air.andP;  The relatively small noses andother features of Far Eastern people could have been an adaptation to anextremely cold environment.andP;  Perhaps their ancestors evolved in one of thenastier parts of Siberia.andM;Some of the visible differences in widely separated groups are certainly notenvironmental adaptations, but are the result of genetic &quot;drift.&quot;andP;  Forexample, a small population with a chance collection of geneticcharacteristics may happen to grow into a very large population thatpropagates those characteristics.andM;HOW DO WE DESCRIBE PEOPLE?andM;In addition to using ethnic classifications tofight discriminations, ethnicterms are also used for visual identification by police and the media, thoughwith different conventions.andP;  While police reports are usually specific (&quot;maleCaucasian, 5 feet 10&quot;), newspapers usually report only departures from theracial norm.andP;  In other words, if the person's race is not mentioned, it ispresumably &quot;white.&quot;andP;  Seldom does either group identify people as being ofmixed blood, even though a very large portion of the people they deal withactually are.andM;While many people in the United States visually match certain racialstereotypes, many do not and the proportion in the latter category isincreasing every year.andP;  People who don't fit any racial stereotypes can causeserious problems for those who try to identify them in racial terms.andP;  Forexample, I know a lady with very dark skin and bright orange-red hair.andP;  Howdo you suppose she should be classified?andP;  I saw some comely ladies inAmsterdam a few years ago with pale skin and bright green hair.andP;  To whichracial group would you say they belong?andM;Obviously, the police and others who use racial terms for identification haveno clearer understanding of these terms than do the bureaucrats.andP;  For themost part, they seem to use racial terms as synoyms for skin color.andP;  Thus, itis reasonable to ask why they don't use a more precise vocabulary thatalready exists: artists' terms for skin color.andP;  The reason seems to be rootedin history; racial terms were adopted for individual identification at a timewhen our entire society was racist, including police and newspaper reporters.andO;Old habits die hard.andM;Fortunately, for those who long for a way out of the classification morass,help is on the way!andM;FUZZY CONCEPT MADE PRECISEandM;Given that human genetic codes are now in the process of being unravelled, itwill soon be possible to accurately classify people into racial groups.andP;  Allwe need to is measure the distance between a givenindividual's genetic codeand those of various racial standards and assign that person to the nearestracial group.andP;  There are several schemes under development for measuringgenetic distance.andP;  One of the more straightforward methods uses an adaptationof Hamming distance.andP;  The basic genetic material, DNA, is composed of stringsof nucleotides, each of which consists of one of four bases: adenine,thymine, guanine, or cytosine.andP;  In computer terms, then, the geneticinformation can be represented as a string of bytes, each having one of fourvaues.andP;  The distance between two such codes can be taken as simply the numberof corresponding positions in which the two codes differ.andM;The word corresponding is a bit tricky.andP;  Considerable analysis may be neededto align elements that have the same or similar functions, given that theremay be gaps or additions in one code or the other.andM;The principal function of DNA is to control the fabrication of proteins usingvarious kinds of RNa as intermediaries, but only about 1 percent of the DNAsequences represent protein formulas.andP;  Some of the remaining materialapparently represents control structures, which determine when the variousfabrication events happen, but there also appears to be a lot of&quot;garbage&quot;--codes that do nothing.andP;  About 10 percent of the material isso-called satellite DNA, which consists of the same sequence concatenatedover and over up to thousands of tims.andP;  Another 20 percent consists of thesame sequence repeated in many scattered places.andP;  The functions of theserepeated sequences, if any, are unknown.andM;If you consider this scheme to be a byte-level metric, there is also aword-level distance measure that can be used.andP;  Genetic mechanisms interpretthe code in three-byte words, called &quot;codons&quot; by geneticists, each of whichspecifies one of 20 amino acids or a &quot;stop&quot; code.andP;  Thus, another plausibledistance measure is simply a count of the number of corresponding codons inwhich there is a difference in the amino acid specified.andP;  Note that each wordcould designate one of 4.sup.3 = 64 actions, but a number of codes yield thesame action, leaving just 21 possibilities.andP;  The designer apparently left noundefined codes for future use.andM;Unfortunately, it will not be practical to routinely analyze individualgenetic codes in their entirety for the forseeable future--the currentpractical limit is to determine a few thousand nucleotide sequences at atime, whereas human DNA contains about 3 billion.andP;  There are plans to map theentire sequence for some individual, but that will be a major undertakingthat could not be done routinely for many people anytime soon.andM;Nevertheless, it is practical to measure genetic distance based oncomparisons of selected genes.andP;  To do this, we will need to select the set tobe used and define corresponding code sequences for the various racialstandards, such as a standard Black, standard White, standard Chinese, etc.andO;Of course, some will want to carry this a step further and define a standardTexan or even a standard South Philadelphian.andM;The process of choosing which races will be &quot;standard&quot; will no doubt generatea lot of heat, but suppose we manage to do it.andP;  Then everyone can beclassified as being a member of the racial group whose standard is closest tohis or her own.andM;With either of the two distance measures discussed earlier or one of theothers that are under development, it will be possible to assign everyoneunambiguously to a racial group except for the rare individuals who happen tobe exactly equidistant from the two closest standards.andP;  To deal with theserare exceptions, we can probably devise some tie-breaking rules.andM;While this marvel of future science will yield exact and unambiguous racialclassifications, such a scheme clearly will not be useful for visualidentification.andP;  In fact, I can't think of anything that it would be goodfor, other than to provide a formalized basis for bigotry.andM;For the purpose of identification, the individual's genetic codes will be farmore useful than any racial classification derived from them.andM;URGE TO MERGEandM;Whether we solve the problem of racial discrimination through education,political action, and law enforcement, human biology will apparently solve itfor us in the long run.andP;  If there are no major influxes of foreignpopulations into the United States, distinguishable racial groups willessentially disappear in this country within a few centuries because of the&quot;urge to merge.&quot;andP;  In other words, the United States seems destined to becomea nation of mongrels.andM;This blending process almost certainly happened in other parts of the worldin the past, producing many of the &quot;homogeneous&quot; modern human populationsseen today.andP;  In the United States, future white supremacists and black poweradvocates must inevitably reconcile themselves to being members of shrinkingminorities.andP;  I predict that as the mongrels become dominant, new rallyingcries will be heard; perhaps, &quot;Beige is beautiful.&quot;andP;  Before that happens,though, they must learn to identify themselves as members of the new breedrather than as members of traditional races.andP;  The U.S.andP;  government currentlydenies them that right.andM;CONCLUSIONSandM;I have argued that all historical and present racial and ethnicclassification systems for individuals are nonsensical, as are the laws,court decisions, computer applications, and bureaucratic superstructures thathave been built on top of them.andM;The attempt to use computers to assist in racial classification tasks hashelped sharpen the issues because computers can't deal with fuzzy concepts.andO;If you try to define an ethnic code that is logically complete, consistent,and determinable for every person using current technology, you find that youcan't.andM;There seems to be a silent conspiracy to deny the existence of mixed racialgroups in the United States.andP;  Most people of mixed race have acquiesced tothis conspiracy and don't even think of themselves in those terms.andP;  Instead,they go along with the idea that they are members of one of the racesrecognized by the government.andP;  In fact, they often identify with atraditional race that represents only a small fraction of their geneticheritage.andM;Apparently, rigorous racial classification will soon be possible throughadvances in genetics and the development of computerized racial stereotypes,though the usefulness of such schemes is suspect.andP;  Thus one answer to thetitle question, &quot;Can computers cope with human races?&quot; is &quot;Not yet, butsoon--but who cares?&quot;andM;Even if we fail to deal effectively with the racial issues, it appears thatthe &quot;urge to merge&quot; will eventually settle this problem for our descendents.andO;It is encouraging to know that nature will handle it if we screw up.andM;Many people have quietly resisted the persistent nonsense of racialclassification by either refusing to answer such questions or by listingthemselves as &quot;human.&quot;andP;  Over the last 25 years, I have consistently answered&quot;mongrel.&quot;andP;  In order to turn back the classifiers, I believe that it will benecessary to form an identifiable movement with a distinctive title.andP;  As longas we're choosing a name, why not identify with the long-term winners?andP;  Ipropose USA Mongrels.andM;I invite others to join in self-declassification, with the hope andexpectation that the bureaucrats and politicians will eventually be forced toquit playing with this issue and will recognize that the United States ofAmerica is a nation of egalitarian mongrels.andP;  I believe that we will all bebetter off.andP;  So will the computers.andM;Finally, computer scientists who encounter problems in adapting humanconcepts to computer use should not assume that the source of such problemsnecessarily lies in the limitations of computers.andP;  There is a realpossibility that the concept itself may be flawed.andM;Acknowledgements.andP;  Thanks to B.
