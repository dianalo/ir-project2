British Petroleum Co. this week said it will withdraw froma $5 billion project to establish a liquefied natural gasindustry in Qatar after concluding that the probablefinancial returns wouldn't be sufficient. That followed lastyear's decision by Royal Dutch/Shell Group to end an accordto provide management services for Qatar's offshore oilindustry, terminating a 40-year involvement in running thefields.</LP><TEXT>   Diplomats said they expect Qatar will increasingly turn toU.S. and French oil concerns to fill the vacuum left by theretreating British concerns.   Texaco Inc. and Mobil Corp. of the U.S. and France's twostate oil companies -- Total-Compagnie Francaise des Petrolesand Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine -- are already indetailed talks with state-owned Qatar General Petroleum Corp.for a new oilfield management accord.   W. Henson Moore, U.S. deputy energy secretary, visitedQatar this month as part of a tour of several Gulf states.Sources said he stressed U.S. interest in taking a greaterrole in Qatar's oil sector.   France has greatly expanded its commercial interests inQatar recently; and Total and Elf have both taken a growingrole in the liquefied natural gas development program, whichhas been under study since the early 1980s.   BP and Shell have effectively terminated the dominant rolethey had held in the Qatari hydrocarbons sector sincedevelopment began in the 1930s. That role partly reflectedBritain's colonial influence in the emirate before Qatargained its independence in 1971.   Qatar's oil industry was nationalized in the 1970s, butQatar kept on the former equity holders to provide servicesfor its oil fields, which produce 400,000 barrels a day ofcrude oil.   Shell provided 25 staff members for Qatar's offshorefields, and BP and other members of the old Iraq PetroleumCo. consortium helped run the onshore fields.   Shell decided to end its service agreement at the end of1991 after Qatar failed to respond to its request for arenewed equity interest in the offshore fields. Internationaloil companies are increasingly reluctant to commit staff andresources overseas without holding some kind of equity, andmost Gulf oil producers are still reluctant to reverse thenationalizations of the 1970s.   After Shell's withdrawal, Qatar decided to end the serviceagreement with the old Iraq Petroleum partners as well andconclude a new accord with a single oil company for both theonshore and offshore fields.   So far, the U.S. and French oil companies have taken thegreatest interest in the new service contract, though theytoo are said to be pressing for equity or production-sharingarrangements. Shell has also indicated it is willing toreturn to Qatar, but only if its longstanding demand forequity is met, industry sources said.   Meanwhile, Qatar is about to embark on the constructionphase of its huge LNG project, which some expect to replaceoil as the emirate's main source of export income.   Qatar plans to process gas from a huge offshore deposit,the North Field, which contains proven gas reserves of around150 trillion cubic feet.   Qatargas, a special company set up in 1984 to organize theproject, will build a four million-metric-ton-a-year LNGplant at Ras Laffan, in the north of the emirate, which willstart exporting gas to Japan toward the end of the 1990s.   The plant alone could cost as much as $2.5 billion, andthere will be extra investment in offshore drilling, thepurchase of tankers and the building of a port at Ras Laffan.   BP now plans to dispose of its 7.5% stake in Qatargas,ending its involvement in the project. The remaining foreignpartners are Total and two Japanese concerns, Mitsui andamp; Co.and Marubeni Corp., each of which holds a 7.5% stake. QatarGeneral Petroleum owns 70%.   BP's withdrawal, which wasn't immediately announced inQatar, probably will cause consternation there because of theproject's high profile, diplomats said. It may also worryAsian customers who are billed as the major end-users of theproject's liquefied natural gas.   Last year, Qatargas signed a long-term contract withJapanese utility Chubu Electric Power Co., which will buy LNGstarting in 1997. Qatar is seeking other Asian buyers for thegas.   BP said it withdrew because the project didn't provideenough financial return and because the company has betterinvestment opportunities elsewhere. Sources said BP's exitmay accelerate French involvement in the whole LNG project.   Last year, Total agreed to carry out upstream developmentof the North Field to supply the gas needed for the LNGplant. Elf agreed to develop another area of the field for aseparate LNG project, for which Elf is hoping to find new gasbuyers in Asia.</TEXT></DOC>
