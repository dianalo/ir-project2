Merseyside police Inspector Bill Dugdale said the protestersentered the immigration office in this northern England port citythis morning, chained and padlocked the main door to keep out staff,then ended their protest.   ``They never got past the foyer, and we had been intent on doingnothing,'' Dugdale said. ``They either got fed up or they thinkthey've achieved their objective. They left the premises of theirown free will.''   The protesters caused no damage and none of them was arrested, hesaid.   On Wednesday, police smashed their way into a church vestry inManchester, 30 miles from Liverpool, and dragged away Sri Lnakanactivist Viraj Mendis, 32.   Mendis, who moved into the church after being issued a deporationorder in 1986, says he fears persecution or death if returned to hisIndian Ocean homeland, which is wracked by ethnic violence betweenguerrillas of the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamilpopulations.   He was taken to a London prison to await deportation Friday. Hislawyer, David Burgess, said he would appeal the deportation in theHigh Court.   ``He was surprisingly spirited but he must be very apprehensiveabout what will happen,'' Burgess told reporters after visitingMendis in the hospital wing of Pentonville Prison.   The government said Mendis would be sent home unless a thirdcountry accepted him. Home Office Minister Timothy Renton said onWednesday that Mendis ``had no well-founded case of persecution inSri Lanka.''   Mendis, who is Sinhalese, claims his life is threatened by hispolitical activism in favor of communism and the Tamil minority.   His removal from the church caused an outcry from his supporters,who said the action violated his ancient right to sanctuary in achurch.   Under English common law, a person accused of committing a crimecould take sanctuary in a church but had to surrender or leave thecountry in 40 days. This right was abolished in 1623, but Mendis'supporters chose the ancient right as his last resort to stay inBritain.</TEXT></DOC>
