Chrysler Corp. was the most notable exception as its car salesfell behind those of Japanese rivals Honda and Toyota last month.   ``We think the industry bottomed in sales in November of 1989and that production bottomed in January of '90,'' analyst DougLaughlin of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. of New York said Thursday.   Laughlin said sales bottomed out in November and have improvedsince then, with a few minor setbacks.   In sales figures reported Wednesday, domestic automakers saidthey sold 2.9 percent more cars and trucks in late March than inthe corresponding period last year.   Analysts and others are quick to point out that drawing aconclusion from a 10-day reporting period can be dangerous becauseit is such a tiny sample of a huge industry.   However, Laughlin and others say they are beginning to wonder ifthe industry is rebounding, especially with other economic factorsfigured in.   ``The strong income growth and job creation and a stable primerate has created a nice underpinning for sales,'' said Scott Merlisof Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. of New York.   But that underlying demand apparently hasn't reached Chrysler'scars, partly because of Honda's and Toyota's U.S. assembly plants.   With imports counted in, Chrysler dealers sold 70,849 cars lastmonth, just less than the 71,086 sold by Honda. Toyota sold 79,320cars, or about nine for every eight sold by Chrysler.   ``They have conceded some market share in cars,'' Laughlin saidof the nation's No. 3 auto maker. ``They are the mosttruck-oriented company in the business.''   Chrysler sold 73,665 trucks last month, 4 percent more than itscars.   ``I don't see much reason for that to change in the next fewmonths,'' said auto analyst David Healy of the brokerageBarclays-BZW in New York. ``Chrysler has been slipping in retailpassenger car market share recently.''   For all of March, Chrysler held 7.6 percent of the market forNorth American built cars, down from 9.4 percent during March 1989.General Motors Corp. held 33.2 percent of the market last month andFord Motor Co. had 20.4 percent, each down 0.3 percentage points.   Chrysler and Ford reported declines in their late March carsales of 23.7 percent and 8.1 percent respectively, while GM posteda 3.9 percent increase.   Sales have been slumping since last October, and executives ofthe Big Three have forecast that the first half of this year wouldremain soft before sales pick up in the second half.   In January, assembly lines nationwide ground to a halttemporarily as automakers took drastic steps to shrink new-carinventories, estimated to be more than 90 selling days, by shuttingoff the flow of vehicles at the source.   The strategy appears to have worked.   At the end of February, according to the weekly industry journalWard's Automotive Reports, new-car inventories stood at 66 days,considered good for early spring.   That level, when combined with what some analysts say is astrengthening demand and a stable economy, could indicate a reboundis on the way.   ``I think fingers are crossed that the worst is behind us,''Laughlin said.   Other analysts, including Healy, were more cautious.   ``I think the best way to look at it is the (sales) numbers forthe full month,'' he said. ``If you do that, not a great deal ishappening.''</TEXT></DOC>
