Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., told agathering of the American Sugar Alliance.   He and Rep. Willis Gradison, R-Ohio, want a 10 percent reductionin the government guaranteed sugar price. They say beet and canefarmers should prepare themselves for changes in world trade thatwill eventually lead to even greater adjustments in the program.   The sugar program is bitterly opposed by manufacturers of candy,baked goods, soft drinks and other sweets because it preventscheaper world-priced sugar from being sold in the United States.   In defense of government sugar support, House Agriculture sugarsubcommittee chairman Jerry Huckaby, D-La., said it keeps pricesstable and predictable for sweets manufacturers. It is necessary tocompete with more heavily subsidized sugar from Europe, he said.   The world market is a ``dump market,'' said Arlan Stangeland,R-Minn. ranking minority member on Huckaby's subcommittee.   Stangeland said sugar producing countries take what they needfor themselves, sell to preferred customers at the highest ratespossible and dump the rest on the world market at low prices, oftensubsidized by their governments.   Downey and Gradison also attacked the program as bad foreignpolicy.   It holds domestic prices at 22 cents a pound, about 9 cents morethan the average world price, by controlling the amount of sugarthat can be imported from sugar producing nations. Many of thecountries are desperately poor but have excellent sugar-growingcapacity.   ``It doesn't make any sense to not allow sugar imports fromcountries we are paying foreign aid,'' said Downey.   He said the United States should allow those countries ``to getout from us infusing them and allow them to do somethingproductive.''   Gradison said the government's import quota program squeezes theeconomies of Caribbean nations, who have a better climate for sugarproduction than the United States.   Downey and Gradison said the Bush administration has shownsupport for their position.   Huckaby said he feared the administration saw the sugar programas something that could be traded away in exchange for concessionsfrom other countries during international trade talks aimed atreducing subsidies worldwide.   He and the other three congressmen all said it was too early topredict the outcome of the international talks, though Huckaby said``I would be amazed if any significant agreement was reached inagriculture.''   The House and Senate are each expected to begin floor debate onthe 1990 farm bill next month.   Huckaby said the House and Senate sugar proposals are similarexcept the House would require the government to allow no less than1.25 million tons of imported sugar in the country each year, andpermit another half million tons in imports through a re-exportprogram involving U.S. refiners.   Downey and Gradison said they'll make the case on the Housefloor that sugar, or any agricultural product, should not betreated so differently as other goods U.S. makers sell abroad.</TEXT></DOC>
