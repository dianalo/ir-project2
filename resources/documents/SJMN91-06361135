He livesin a motel with his 9-year-old sister, Heather, his unemployed father and hismother, a waitress.;   In the meantime, a free private school called theMustard Seed is helping keep dreams alive for Joe and other homeless childrenwho, among other needs, are hungry to learn.;   Housed in twin cottages;   Theschool, housed in tiny twin cottages, has two classrooms, a small library andoffers frequent field trips for its students, ages 4 to 18. Its surroundingsare more homelike than the motel rooms, shelters or cars where the youngsterslive.;   Director Karen Banker, who co-founded Mustard Seed nearly three yearsago, calls her students the &quot;invisible kids&quot; that society forgot.;   &quot;Thething we found when we started was the kids really, really wanted to doschool,&quot; she said. &quot;They wanted to do math and they wanted to do reading. Theyresponded so quickly to having a little structure in their lives.&quot;;   Classsize fluctuates;   The faces change daily, and class size fluctuates with theeconomy.;   Banker believes the school is unique because it relies solely onprivate donations for its $72,000 annual budget and accepts children withoutregard to school district boundaries or residence in a particular shelter.;  The school pays two teachers, one full time, one half time. Most staffers,including Banker, are unpaid.;   &quot;We get a number of volunteers who say eitherthat they've been homeless before or they know they could be,&quot; Banker said.;  Banker, a former special-education teacher, and graphic artist Ellen Reay gottheir idea for starting Mustard Seed when they worked as volunteers at a dayshelter for women and children.;   Startled to learn that many of the childrenwere out of school, they began leading educational activities in a cottageowned by the shelter's parent organization, Loaves andamp; Fishes.;   Enrollmentexpanded;   Enrollment quickly expanded as youngsters returned for schoolingeven after their stay at the shelter was up.;   Mustard Seed opened as afull-fledged private school in February 1989. About 750 youngsters have sincepassed through its doors, staying an average of two to three weeks, and halfthe students have been placed in public schools.;   &quot;We always knew from DayOne that what we wanted to do was right,&quot; said Reay. &quot;We've gotten hundreds ofkids in school. We've turned around lives.&quot;;   Each school day, a Mustard Seedvan picks up students at motels in California's capital city. Recruiting isexpected to start soon at river camps.;   The school collects clothing andraises money for new shoes, alarm clocks and a &quot;graduation gift&quot; of a backpackand new school supplies.;   'Really need to fit in';   &quot;They have to havedecent clothes because if they don't, they're teased,&quot; Banker said. &quot;Thesekids, they feel like they have 'homeless' stamped on their foreheads. Theyreally need to fit in.&quot;;   Brandi Sheets, a 10-year-old who lives in a motel,said other kids teased her at her last school. &quot;Every time I would walk inclass, people would say, &quot;Ooh, Brandi's here -- cootie girl.&quot;;   &quot;I like thisschool because the first time I came here I couldn't read,&quot; she said. &quot;Now Ican read perfectly. I learned to do math and division. It's better than myother school.;   Advice for some adults;   &quot;I see a lot of grown-ups who don'tknow how to read,&quot; Brandi added. &quot;They should come here.&quot;;   Betty Bills, whoteaches first-, second- and third-graders, recalled giving a book to a10-year-old boy who was just learning to read.;   His eyes grew wide, shesaid. Then he hugged her, exclaiming, &quot;I love you, Betty.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Sacramento  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911226  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  706  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, December 26, 199100361135,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
