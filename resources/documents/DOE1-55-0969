Homogeneously broadenedlasers with Fabry-Perot and with positive branch, confocal unstable resonatorswere modeled. Both time-dependent and steady-state analyses of free-runningand injected lasers were performed. Because of deficiencies in the standing-wavesemiclassical and the simple saturable gain models, a new semiclassicaltheory of homogeneously broadened lasers were developed. The theory ispredicted upon the following assumptions: the atoms are two-level, asingle longitudinal mode exists in the cavity, the transverse mode structurecan be adequately modeled by the geometric optics mode, and the laserelectric fields can be described by a pair of counterpropagating planar,cylindrical, or spherical traveling waves with different amplitudes.A general semiclassical theory was first developed, and then specializedto the Fabry-Perot and positive branch, confocal unstable resonator cases.Both the Maxwell-Bloch and rate-equation approximation forms of the theorywere derived. The general theory is sufficiently broad to allow the modelingof the geometric optics mode of any standing-wave resonator configuration.The theory was shown to reduce to the simple saturable gain and standing-wavesemiclassical models in the appropriate limits. The analysis of the injectedlasers was performed with the new semiclassical theory. Both time-dependentand steady-state analyses were performed.</TEXT></DOC>
