Reduced maintenancebudgets and downtime allowances have generated the requirement for predictiveand preventative maintenance programs, typically utilizing extensiveexternal instrumentation. Today, the use of active magnetic bearingsas an integral element of the rotating machinery can provide operationaldata previously unattainable or requiring additional external monitoringdevices. In the following pages a brief overview of the active magneticbearing is presented. Consideration is given to the advantages of anelectronically servo-controlled bearing system and the operational benefitsinherently provided. Finally, integration of the systems monitoring capabilitiesto the facilities equipment monitoring and trending programs are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
