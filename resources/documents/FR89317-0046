Program Description</ITAG>In 1974, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (Pub. L. 93-247,42 U.S.C. 5101, <T3>et seq.</T3>) established in the Department the National Center onChild Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN). NCCAN is located organizationally withinthe Children's Bureau of the Administration for Children, Youth and Familiesin the Office of Human Development Services.Under the Act, the NCCAN carries out, among other activities, the followingresponsibilities:andbullet; Makes grants to States that comply with Federal requirements toimplement State child abuse and neglect prevention and treatment programs.andbullet; Funds public or nonprofit private organizations to carry out research,demonstration, and service improvement programs and projects designed toprevent, identify and treat child abuse and neglect.andbullet; Collects, analyzes, and disseminates information, e.g., compilesand disseminates training materials, prepares an annual summary of recentand ongoing research on child abuse and neglect, and maintains a nationalinformation clearinghouse.andbullet; Assists States and communities in implementing child abuse andneglect programs.andbullet; Coordinates Federal programs, activities, and information, inpart through the Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect and the Inter-AgencyTask Force on Child Abuse and Neglect.Regulations applicable to State and discretionary grants are found at 45CFR Part 1340, with the most recent revision having been published on February6, 1987 (52 FR 3990).Each of the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealthof Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealthof the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the PacificIslands are eligible to apply for State grants. We will refer to thesejurisdictions as ``States'' in this preamble discussion. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. New Provisions </ITAG>The Child Abuse Prevention, Adoption, and Family Services Act of 1988,Pub. L. 100-294, was signed into law on April 25, 1988. Title I of thatAct, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (the Act), was reorganized;new provisions were added; and other changes were made. The amended Actincludes provisions that: andbullet; Increase the public membership and revise the role of the AdvisoryBoard on Child Abuse and Neglect; andbullet; Establish an Inter-Agency Task Force on Child Abuse and Neglectto coordinate Federal efforts with respect to child abuse prevention andtreatment programs; andbullet; Provide authority for the Secretary to extend previous waiversof State eligibility requirements; andbullet; Continue the requirement to establish a national child abuse andneglect data collection and analysis program; andbullet; Authorize discretionary grants in several new areas; andbullet; Increase from three to five years the maximum duration of supportallowable for research grants; andbullet; Continue to require the Secretary to publish NCCAN proposed researchpriorities for comment and also make that requirement applicable to demonstrationpriorities; andbullet; Require NCCAN to establish a formal peer review process for purposesof evaluating applications for grants and contracts; and andbullet; Require the conduct of four new studies, i.e., studies on theincidence of child abuse of handicapped children, the incidence of childabuse in alcoholic families, the legal representation of children in childabuse or neglect cases, and the incidence of child abuse or neglect amongchildren who are members of historically underserved or unserved groups.Based on the changes contained in Pub. L. 100-294, we are proposing tomake technical and conforming changes in 45 CFR Part 1340, the regulationsapplicable to the Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention and Treatment Program.In addition, we are proposing to clarify the fact that the statutory prerequisitesto Federal funding apply to basic State grants under section 8(b) of theAct, but not compliance and education grants under section 8(f). We are issuing these regulations as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)in accordance with section 401 of Pub. L. 100-294, which requires the Secretaryto publish proposed regulations, allow a minimum of 45 days for publiccomment, and publish a final rule. <ITAG tagnum="85">III. Section by Section Discussion of Proposed Technical Amendments</ITAG>We propose to amend the Authority Statement to remove unnecessary referencesto the Act and to cite only the United States Code citation for the Act.We propose a technical change in andSection; 1340.1(a) to remove the words``of 1974, as amended'' in the first sentence to conform to the Act's newtitle, the ``Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act.'' (See section 1of the Act.)In andSection; 1340.2(h), we propose to make two corrections in the definitionof ``State'' to conform with the language in the Act. We have added thewords ``Commonwealth of'' before the words ``Puerto Rico'' and changed``Trust Territories of the Pacific'' to ``Trust Territory of the PacificIslands.'' Currently, the Compact of Free Association (Pub. L. 99-239,amended by Pub. L. 99-658, section 104(c)) limits the amount of formulagrant funding to the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islandsin fiscal year 1989 to twenty-five percent of the amount provided in fiscalyear 1986. The funding for the Republic of Palau continues at the fiscalyear 1986 level. In light of the statutory provision and the current fluidsituation, we have continued to refer to these entities collectively as``the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.''We propose to revise the statement of purpose in andSection; 1340.10 to conformwith the renumbering of the Act and to reflect new language in section8 of the Act. The revised language will reflect the statutory directionthat grants to States are intended to ``develop, strengthen, and carryout'' State child abuse and neglect prevention and treatment programs.We also propose to delete the modifier ``discretionary'' before ``grants''to clarify that requirements must be met by States for them to receivebasic grants.We propose to make a technical change in andSection; 1340.13(a)(2) to insertFebruary 6, 1987, in place of the phrase ``the effective date of theseregulations.''Under the prior legislation, the Secretary had authority to grant waivers,in some circumstances, to States which did not comply with Federal requirements(other than those requirements for disabled infants with life-threateningconditions now in section 8(b)(10) of the Act) but were found to be makinga good faith effort to do so. Pub. L. 100-294 authorized an extension,under certain circumstances, of waivers granted under the prior provision.Specifically, only a State which had been granted a waiver that expiredat the end of fiscal year 1986 may be granted a continuation of that waiver,if the Secretary finds that the State is making a good faith effort tocomply with all requirements. Waivers may be extended through the end offiscal year 1988 or, in the case of a State the legislature of which meetsbiennially, through the end of fiscal year 1989 or the next regularly scheduledsession of such legislature, whichever is earlier. Accordingly, we proposetechnical changes in andSection; 1340.13(c) to reflect the Secretary's authorityto extend waivers of State eligibility requirements. Technical changesare also proposed to conform with the renumbering of the Act which placedState eligibility requirements in section 8(b) of the Act.A technical change is proposed in andSection; 1340.14(a) to conform withthe renumbering of the Act which placed State eligibility requirementsin section 8(b) of the Act.A technical change is proposed to andSection; 1340.15(a) to conform withthe renumbering of the Act which placed State eligibility requirementspertaining to medical neglect in section 8(b)(10) of the Act.A technical change is proposed to andSection; 1340.15(b) to conform withthe renumbering of the Act which placed definitions in section 14 of theAct.In andSection; 1340.15(c)(1), we are proposing to delete the words ``thissection'' and substitute the words ``section 8(b) of the Act.'' This changeis intended to clarify and remove any ambiguity about the requirementsStates must meet in order to receive grants under section 8 of the Act.Our policy is that in order for a State to receive basic State grant fundsunder section 8(b) of the Act, it must meet all the eligibility requirementsspecified in section 8(b) as implemented by Part 1340, including andSection;1340.15. On the other hand, compliance with the section 8(b) requirementsis not a prerequisite for grants under section 8(f). These points wouldbe clarified by the proposed change in andSection; 1340.15(c)(1) and thecorresponding change proposed in andSection; 1340.15(d).Technical changes are proposed to andSection; 1340.15(c)(4) to conform withthe renumbering of the Act which placed State eligibility requirementsin section 8(b) of the Act.We have added an Editorial Note at the beginning of the Appendix to Part1340 as an aid to future reference. The note clarifies the context in whichthe interpretative guidelines were developed and refers the reader to theappropriate sections of the Act, as amended. We have also corrected thecitation to the House Conference Committee Report in item andplusmin;6.Finally, section 12 of the Act requires the Secretary to prescribe regulationsand make such arrangements as may be necessary or appropriate to coordinateprogram related to child abuse and neglect which are assisted by Federalfunds. The Department believes that new regulations are not necessary atthis time to implement this provision. The newly structured Advisory Boardon Child Abuse and Neglect and the Inter-Agency Task Force on Child Abuseand Neglect will be effective mechanisms to ensure program coordination.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Impact Analysis</ITAG>Executive Order 12606: The FamilyExecutive Order 12606 requires Federal agencies, in formulating and implementingpolicies and regulations, to assess the impact on family formation, maintenanceand general well-being. We believe these proposed regulations will serveto strengthen and preserve the family by assisting agencies and organizationsat the State and community levels in their efforts to develop, strengthen,and carry out child abuse and neglect prevention and treatment activities.Executive Order 12291Executive Order 12291 requires that a regulatory impact analysis be preparedfor major rules_defined in the Order as any rule that has an annual effecton the national economy of $100 million or more or certain other specifiedeffects. Nothing in either the statute or the proposed rule is likely tocreate substantial costs. Therefore, the Secretary concludes that thisregulation is not a major rule within the meaning of the Executive Orderbecause it does not have an effect on the economy of $100 million or moreor otherwise meet the threshold criteria.Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. Ch. 6),the Department tries to anticipate and reduce the impact of rules and paperworkrequirements on small businesses. For each rule with a ``significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities,'' an analysis is prepareddescribing the rule's impact on small entities. Small entities are definedin the Regulatory Flexibility Act to include small businesses, small non-profitorganizations, and small governmental entities.The primary impact of these regulations is on the States, which are not``small entitles'' within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.For these reasons, the Secretary certifies that these rules will not havea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511, all Departmentsare required to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview and approval any reporting or recordkeeping requirement inherentin a proposed or final rule. This proposed rule does not contain informationcollection requirements or increase the Federal paperwork burden on thepublic or the private sector.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 1340</ITAG>Child abuse and neglect, Child welfare, Disabled, Family violence, Grantprograms_health, Grant programs_social.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 13.669, ChildAbuse and Neglect Prevention and Treatment)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 25, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Sydney Olson,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Assistant Secretary for Human Development Services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: January 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Don M.
