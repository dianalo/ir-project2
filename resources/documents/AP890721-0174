McCANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The city will hire 350 specialists to teachhandicapped students in a plan that settles a four-year disputebetween the school board and the U.S. Department of Education, itwas announced Friday.   ``This settlement brings to an end what can only be described asthe shameful and disgraceful mistreatment of those children who aremost vulnerable and in need of special care,'' James W. Compton,president of the Chicago Board of Education, said at a newsconference where he was surrounded by 20 handicapped students.   The plan calls for the board to shift money and employees fromcentral and district offices to local schools, said Compton, whowas appointed in a school board shake-up when Mayor Richard M.Daley took office. The plan also creates a new post, interimassociate superintendent, to oversee the services to handicappedstudents.   In the course of the dispute, the school board was threatenedwith the loss of more than $100 million in annual federal aid and$4 million in funds for magnet-schools, which have smaller, moreintensive classes.   The school board allocated $4.4 million of its $365.9 millionspecial-education budget for the settlement, officials said.   Donald Moore, executive director of Designs for Change, aChicago child-advocacy organization, called the plan one of themost significant settlements of its kind in a decade.   ``We think it is excellent,'' he said. ``It is cutting a lot ofcentral office positions and putting that money in the localschools where it is needed.''   The dispute arose in 1984, when the federal agency investigatedthe delivery of services to handicapped students by the ChicagoPublic Schools.   The 15-month probe found that the school system, by failing toevaluate and place handicapped children promptly, was in violationof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.   The law requires that students believed to have mental,emotional or physical disabilities be tested and evaluated within60 days and, if warranted, placed in special-education programs.   About 3,500 Chicago students have not been not evaluated _ abacklog dating to 1983, school officials said Friday. There areabout 41,000 handicapped students in the system, which has about410,000 students.   Last August, an administrative law judge upheld the government'sfinding and ordered that federal money be withheld from Chicagoschools if the system was not brought into compliance.   Moore said the dispute hurt a number of handicapped students.   He said hundreds of parents of handicapped students have come tohis agency seeking help for children who had not received properplacement.   ``When the handicapped child is sitting in a regular classroomand not receiving proper care, they tend to deteriorate,'' he said.   Plans call for the hiring of additional teachers, psychologists,social workers and counselors.   Compton said the school system's special education structurewould be completely reorganized by the start of the fall semester.</TEXT></DOC>
