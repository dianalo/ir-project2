DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bondchief Michael Milken and his brother have pleaded innocent to amassive racketeering and securities fraud indictment but theirlawyers will be back in court next week to settle on bail.   Looking tan and smiling, Milken, 42, dressed in a navy blue,pinstriped suit entered his plea Friday before a standing-room-onlycrowd at federal court in Manhattan.   Outside the courthouse later, dozens of applauding supporters,some wearing hats that read ``Mike Milken We Believe in You,''cheered him and shook his hand as he left without comment.   ``Mr. Milken looks forward to the opportunity to have his storycome out in court where you have due process and the truth willemerge,'' said one of Michael Milken's lawyers, Arthur L. Liman.   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder denied reports that prosecutorsasked it to bar employees from holding a courthouse rally forMilken. But the firm issued a statement sympathetic to Milkensupporters.   ``Some individuals have chosen to express their support for Mikeat this very difficult and emotional time for him,'' Drexel said.`We understand their desire to express their feelings.''   Supporters also rallied for Milken at Drexel's annual high-yieldbond conference being held this week in Beverly Hills, Calif. wherethe Drexel high yield bond department is headquartered.   Also pleading innocent before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood atfederal court in Manhattan was Milken's brother, Lowell, 40. Athird defendant, former Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg was absentdue to a skiing accident and will be arraigned April 25.   All three were named in a 98-count federal securities fraud andracketeering indictment handed up by a grand jury March 29.   Both Milkens were released without bail after Assistant U.S.Attorney John Carroll said prosecutors and defense lawyers ``madesubstantial progress'' during talks to reach an acceptable bond forthe defendants and their assets.   The racketeering charges seek $1.85 billion in forfeitures fromeach of the three defendants, which amounts to their total combinedearnings at Drexel from 1984 to 1987. The government reportedly hadasked the three defendants to post a $1 billion bond to avoidpretrial restraints on their assets.   Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act,assets found by the jury to be the result of racketeeringactivities are subject to forfeiture proceedings and prosecutorscould ask the judge to freeze the Milkens' assets to guaranteetheir availability in the event of a conviction.   Ms. Wood scheduled another court session for Tuesday morning, atCarroll's request, to finalize bond arrangements.   Lowell Milken, dressed in a gray suit, said, ``I plead notguilty'' in a loud firm voice when asked by the judge.   In addition to the potential $1.85 billion in forfeiture, allthree defendants face possible maximum fines of $3.7 billion eachif convicted on either of two racketeering charges.   Prosecutors, however, concede that upon conviction, a judge isunlikely to impose maximum fines or maximum prison sentences, whichwould be 520 years in Michael Milken's case.   Milken, took a leave of absence from his job as head of the junkbond division, where he reportedly made more than $1 billion overfour years, including $550 million in 1987.   The racketeering indictment followed a more than two-yearinvestigation of Wall Street's fifth-largest investment firm thatwas triggered by information supplied by convicted stock speculatorIvan Boesky.   Drexel in December agreed to plead guilty to six felonies andpay a record $650 million to settle securities fraud charges withthe U.S. attorney's office.   The plea deal is conditional on settlement of separate civilinsider trading charges filed by the Securities and ExchangeCommission against Drexel. Sources familiar with the negotiationssaid the agreement could be completed next week.   Milken, though, is challenging the criminal deal on the groundsthat is violates his rights by forcing Drexel to fire him andwithhold his 1988 pay of more than $100 million.</TEXT></DOC>
