In the West Bank town of Hebron, about 30 armed Jewish settlerslocked themselves into two empty Arab-owned buildings they claim areused to stage firebomb attacks on Israelis.   In a nationally televised speech to his right-wing Likud, Shamirvowed:   ``There will be no Palestinian state here. Never.''   Israel was linked to only one people _ the Jews, he said.   ``Aliens, terrorists, PLO men and others are recalled in thatcontext today. But they are brutal, wild, alien invaders in the Landof Israel that belongs to the people of Israel, and only to them.''   Sunday's clashes with soldiers erupted as merchants closed shopsand public transportation halted in the Gaza Strip to protestSaturday's fatal shooting of two Arab teen-agers.   Another youth, Mohammed Jamil Mattar, 17, died Sunday whensoldiers fired on stone throwers in the Shati refugee camp,according to Arab hospital officials.   His death raises to 374 the number of Palestinians killed duringthe 14-month uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bankand Gaza Strip. Fifteen Israelis have died.   In Gaza, soldiers opened fire in three other refugee camps and avillage, wounding 19 Palestinians, hospital officials said. Fourmore Palestinians were reported wounded by troops in a West Bankvillage.   The army confirmed Mattar's death and said it is investigatingthe circumstances. A military spokesman said the army had reports of10 injuries.   The worst violence was in Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, where 11demonstrators were reported shot. The youngest victim was 2-year-oldAhmed Muhaisin, wounded in the left leg with a plastic bullet andreported in stable condition at Ahli Arab hospital.   Muhaisin's mother told Arab reporters the child was playing infront of their home when he was shot.   The army imposed curfews on Jabaliya, Shati and Khan Yunisrefugee camps.   Jewish settlers in Hebron, most of whom live in the center of thePalestinian city, seized two abandoned, Arab-owned buildingsadjacent to the settlement of Beit Ramano.   They moved into the buildings early Sunday, carrying weapons,food and mattresses. They told soldiers they would not leave unlessthe army took over the houses or turned them over to settlers.   The army declared the area a closed military district and sealedoff an adjacent market with barbed wire.   Arabs living nearby said soldiers threw rocks at Arabs anddemanded merchants close their stores.   ``The settlers were singing and dancing in the courtyard,'' saidSadeq Oudeh Shweike, who owns a bakery near the houses. ``One boythrew stones at the settlers and they shot in the air to frightenpeople.''   After several hours of negotiations, the settlers abandoned thearea, saying they were confident the army would set up observationposts on roofs of the houses.   Noam Arnon, spokesman for the 250 Jewish settlers who live inHebron among 90,000 Arabs, said the sit-in was to get across amessage. ``The message is that the government must end politicalrestrictions on the army that stop it from working efficiently andintelligently,'' he said. Jewish settlers want authorities to expelPalestinian leaders and allow troops to shoot more freely.   In a separate incident Sunday, vandals attacked a Jewish cemeteryin Hebron. They razed a small shack containing prayer books andbibles, and threw a burning tire on a cluster of graves belonging tosome of 74 Jews killed by Arabs during 1929 riots in Hebron.   More than 70,000 Jewish settlers live among the 1.7 millionPalestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on land occupied byIsrael since its capture from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 MiddleEast war.   In Jerusalem, police said they arrested 10 ultra-Orthodox Jewssuspected of attempted bombings and arson attacks againstnon-religious Jews.   Tel Aviv police commander Yigal Marcus told Israel radio they aresuspected of placing bombs along the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highwayon Dec. 31, bombings of three newsstands last August, and settingfire to a grocery store in November after the owners ignoredwarnings against selling secular newspapers.   The bombs along the highway did not explode, and none of theother attacks caused casualties.</TEXT></DOC>
