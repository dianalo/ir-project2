(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>ByandM;Chet SchuylerandM;Today's fastest LANs are the 10M-bps Ethernet and 16M-bps Token-Ring, butcoming down the pike are new topologies that will raise the speed limit to100M bps.andM;At least three emerging LAN technologies will attempt to meet the computerindustry's apparently insatiable demand for speed:andM;-- Fiber Data Distribution Interface (FDDI), an ANSI-standard, 100M-bpsoptical-fiber protocol.andP;  Although it has already garnered wide industrysupport, relatively few products are ready for market.andM;-- The Thomas-Conrad Network System (TCNS) from Thomas-Conrad Corp. ofAustin, Texas, another 100M-bps optical-fiber network, is scheduled to bereleased this month.andM;-- Datapoint Corp. of San Antonio is developing a 20M-bps version of ARCnetthat is eight times faster than the company's current 2.5M-bps model.andO;Current plans call for its release in mid-1991.andM;The topologies reflect the diverse approaches of the LAN industry tostandards, officially recognized standards, de facto standards andproprietary single-company solutions.andM;FDDI is the result of years of deliberations by ANSI, a standards-settingbody.andP;  The standards organizations are methodical to the point of appearingglacial, but the end objective is a series of tightly defined standards thatallow vendors to build components that will interoperate with components fromother vendors.andM;The hoped-for result is that vendors can focus on building better, cheaperproducts rather than reworking code or hardware to keep up with othervendors' changes.andM;Although there is no IEEE- or ANSI-sanctioned standard for ARCnet, Datapointand the manufacturers of ARCnet products have shown a remarkable willingnessand capacity to maintain a high degree of interoperability among ARCnetproducts.andM;This informal standard allows dozens of firms to provide interoperable,low-cost ARCnet components.andM;TCNS is a melding of FDDI's 100M-bps speed and ARCnet's simplicity into anentirely proprietary product.andP;  By beating the competition to market with arelatively low-cost 100M-bps LAN solution, Thomas-Conrad is gambling that itcan generate an enthusiastic response to its product.andM;High-Speed ChoiceandM;FDDI is still in its infancy as a network protocol.andP;  But with the alreadyannounced support of IBM, Digital Equipment Corp., ATandamp;T, Hewlett-Packard Co.andO;and literally dozens of other companies delivering or poised to launchproducts, there is little question that FDDI will become the premierhigh-speed LAN topology.andM;Only a handful of products are available now, but that situation will changequickly.andP;  Industry analysts foresee the market growing from $50 to $60million in 1989 to $350 to $500 million by 1993.andM;In December 1988, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) announced an FDDI chipset called SUPERNET.andP;  The majority of FDDI products on the market use the AMDchip set.andP;  Most of the current interest in FDDI is in developing fiberbackbones to support installations of multiple minicomputers, mainframes andLANs.andP;  Interest in individual computer attachments to FDDI has primarilyfocused on engineering workstations.andM;List prices for FDDI cards for Sun workstations range from $5,000 to $10,000.andO;List prices for fully configured Ethernet or Token-Ring-to-FDDI bridges rangefrom $20,000 to $30,000.andM;FDDI components are still too expensive to enjoy widespread use as a LANtopology, but several trends could change that situation by the mid-1990s.andM;The chip set announced by National Semiconductor Corp. in April is morehighly integrated than AMD's and will allow developers to create smaller,cheaper cards, according to National Semiconductor's Karen Parker, strategicprogram manager for FDDI in Atlanta.andM;Parker also predicted that successive design advances by all FDDImanufacturers will bring single-workstation FDDI component prices down tolist prices of $1,000 within two to three years.andM;Although FDDI is not currently a realistic desktop LAN technology,twisted-pair desktop FDDI connections have been proposed by at least twocompanies, Chipcom Corp. of Waltham, Mass., and SynOptics Communications Inc.andO;of Mountain View, Calif.andM;Both firms proposed twisted-pair standards for FDDI in June, which are underreview by the ANSI X3T9.5 committee, which is responsible for the FDDIspecification.andM;Use of twisted-pair connections would not only reduce cabling costs, butwould allow for less expensive, card-level components.andP;  However, theirutility is limited by the requirement for very small distances between wiringclosets and nodes.andM;Meanwhile, FDDI is still a backbone topology, best suited for tying multiplecomputer systems together.andM;Although the lack of any official blessing might cause some potential buyersto hang back, the low cost of the Thomas-Conrad offering could be a powerfulattraction for companies looking for FDDI speeds at more palatable prices.andM;The TCNS network is a proprietary design of Thomas-Conrad that has neitherthe benefits nor bad points of networks from standards-setting organizations.andO;It is, however, closely tied to ARCnet in many ways.andM;TCNS is a token-passing bus topology that's similar to ARCnet, but includessome features taken from FDDI.andP;  Thomas-Conrad has used AMD chip sets toachieve the 100M-bps speeds of FDDI, but has designed the software interfaceof TCNS to mimic ARCnet so closely that the ARCnet drivers now used with the2.5M-bps ARCnet will work with TCNS cards.andM;According to TCNS literature, a user can replace ARCnet cards with TCNScards, fiber cable and hubs, and the system will run without changing anysoftware.andM;Thomas-Conrad offers 8-bit and 16-bit Industry Standard Architecture-bus TCNSadapters for $995 and $1,495, respectively, and Extended Industry StandardArchitecture bus cards for $1,725.andP;  Micro Channel adapters are still indevelopment.andP;  Hubs for connecting up to eight workstations are priced at$2,295.andM;Lightning Throughput?andM;Thomas-Conrad engineers claim to have benchmarked TCNS delivering 16M bps toindividual workstations.andP;  The throughput is limited by the PC bus andsoftware, according to Peter Rauch, director of systems engineering atThomas-Conrad.andM;The one-station throughput rate of 16M bps equals the upper theoretical limitof 16M-bps Token-Ring and leaves TCNS with another 84M bps for other traffic.andM;TCNS is limited by timing constraints to some of the distance limits of2.5M-bps ARCnet: about 20,000 feet (six kilometers) for the network's totalcabling.andP;  TCNS can support a 2,600-foot fiber cable between a station and anactive hub, somewhat more than ARCnet's 2,000-foot limit.andP;  FDDI can support a100-kilometer ring.andM;The speed and low price of TCNS will likely appeal to LAN integrators lookingfor local high-speed connections.andP;  Many sites committed to the FDDI standardmight want to use TCNS on their cable networks as an interim solution untilFDDI components are more widely available and less costly.andM;An ARCnet-compatible protocol operating at eight times the speed of theexisting 2.5M-bps ARCnet will likely inspire a great deal of interest amongARCnet fans hoping to crank up their installations.andM;Datapoint hopes to have the 20M-bps ARCnet chips available by the firstquarter of 1991 and expects component manufacturers to have cards and hubsavailable by the second quarter.andM;ARCnet has proven itself easy to work with and extremely reliable underadverse conditions.andP;  It is also relatively inexpensive.andP;  At 2.5M bps,however, ARCnet cannot keep up with Ethernet and 16M-bps Token-Ring, muchless the faster technologies coming to market.andM;According to Barry Saddler, Datapoint's director of network systemsdevelopment, ARCnet currently uses a 5MHz signal, but only half those cyclesare used for data.andP;  Every other cycle remains quiet.andP;  In addition, existingARCnet is binary: The signal is either high or low.andM;The new 20M-bps ARCnet will continue using the same 5MHz signal, but it willuse all the cycles, not just half.andP;  The signal will quadruple the data in agiven cycle by using the phase and amplitude of the electrical signal's sinewaves to communicate information, rather than the simpler on/off signal ofthe existing ARCnet.andP;  Each cycle will thereby pack 4 bits of data instead ofonly 1.andM;The 20M-bps ARCnet cards will be able to be installed on existing ARCnetnetworks, Saddler said.andP;  The new cards will detect older 2.5M-bps and other20M-bps cards and communicate to those cards at the appropriate speed.andM;&quot;You will not be able to see the full benefit of 20M-bps ARCnet until thenetwork is predominantly made of 20M-bps stations,&quot; Saddler said.andM;Users will have to evaluate their cabling systems as well.andP;  Although thecurrent ARCnet is remarkably tolerant of poor connections, baluns andmarginal wiring, the more complex signals of the 20M-bps version willprobably require wiring that complies closely with the ARCnet specification.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
