The third photon ionizes the krypton atoms. Excitationand ionization yields are theoretically computed employing the standardlaser rate-equations analysis. Measurements are made on both the excitationand ionization yields. The experimental results are in good agreementwith the theoretical predictions of our formulations, as well as withthose of other authors.</TEXT></DOC>
