Speaking to foreign reporters during an hourlong news conferenceat the Foreign Ministry, Najib said Western countries shouldembrace a ``new spirit of detente'' and do their utmost to helpreach a political settlement.   Najib spoke after the United States spurned his government'srepeated calls for direct talks. Washington supplies most of theweapons to Moslem guerrillas fighting to overthrow Najib's Marxistregime.   The United States and its allies say they will not deal with agovernment installed by Moscow.   Najib suggested that more fighting could turn Afghanistan into a``second Lebanon,'' a reference to the sectarian battles that havewrought havoc in Beirut for 14 years.   ``The West must decide who the United States is aligning itselfwith _ a band of cutthroats. Just look at beautiful Jalalabad,''Najib said through a translator.   He said the rebels are firing between 2,000 and 3,000 rocketsevery day into the eastern city 40 miles from the Pakistani border.   In Islamabad, Pakistan, the rebel Afghan News Agency said theguerrillas killed at least 35 soldiers, captured 37, destroyedeight tanks, and captured two others since Sunday in fighting southof Jalalabad.   Pakistani-based guerrillas began attacking the city three weeksafter Soviet forces on Feb. 15 ended nine years of involvement inthe civil war that began after an April 1978 communist coup.   After initial gains by the rebels, the battle for Jalalabadappears to have settled into a stalemate with casualties believedto number in the thousands on both sides.   The capture of Jalalabad would give the insurgents a badlyneeded victory to bolster their predictions that Afghanistan'sMarxist rulers would fall soon after Soviet soldiers left.   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, a fundamentalist faction leader who servesas foreign minister of the guerrillas' self-proclaimed government,called on the Soviet Union also to stop arming the Afghancommunists.   His written statement, distributed Tuesday, said an end toSoviet military aid would ``enable the real representative of theAfghan nation to assume power in order to hold elections of arepresentative government, which will work to normalize futurerelations between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.''   In his remarks, Najib claimed that 65,000 rebels had agreed tostop fighting, but he gave no details.   Soviet forces entered Afghanistan in 1979 to help the communistgovernment battle the rebels. More than 100,000 troops were in thecountry when the Soviets signed a U.N.-sponsored agreement in April1988 to withdraw.</TEXT></DOC>
