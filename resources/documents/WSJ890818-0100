Just add up the people like Bob Knosp.    When Mr. Knosp started producing computerized sign-making systems in his garage three years ago, he never expected that his products would soon be selling well overseas, even though he advertised in a few international trade journals.    In fact, within the past year, more than half of his $500,000 business has come from abroad. He's been surprised by the number of customers from England, Australia and Switzerland seeking out his Bellevue, Wash., company. In some ways, he even prefers doing business with his new European dealers: Unlike their American counterparts, they promote and advertise his product themselves, rather than relying on him to do so.    Untold numbers of small exporters like Mr. Knosp are now a critical, albeit quiet, component of American exports, foreign trade experts say. Because specific statistics on small exporters aren't kept, it's impossible to know exactly how much they contributed to the unexpected jump in U.S. exports, which hit a record $30.91 billion in June, and in the narrowing of the trade deficit, reported yesterday by the U.S. Commerce Dept. Even so, export specialists say there's both indirect and anecdotal evidence to suggest that small exporters constitute a larger part of the export trade than is often supposed, and their portion is growing.    Indeed, small businesses far outnumber large companies in the export arena. A recent Commerce Department study shows that 80% of the 100,000 American exporters in 1987 had shipments totaling less than $25,000 that year. Most of the firms making such limited shipments are probably small companies, surmises Tony Radspieler, an economist with the Commerce Department's foreign-trade division.    What's more, in the manufacturing sector, there's evidence that small companies may account for a larger share of the nation's manufactured exports than once thought. A recent study by the Small Business Administration estimates that manufacturers with fewer than 500 employees accounted for half of the value of U.S.-made goods exported by manufacturers in 1985.    Foreign trade experts say small-business owners are showing increased interest in opportunities overseas. Lawrence Harper, a consultant in Price Waterhouse's international trade group, detects a &quot;heightened awareness&quot; among small-business owners that they should be developing internationally.    He says that much of the small-business interest focuses on the prospects for expanding in Western Europe, anticipating the removal of nearly all trade barriers there in 1992. &quot;That's doing as much for the small exporter as anything else right now,&quot; he says.    In addition, he says, small businesses are seeing prospective clients from Japan, Taiwan and China. He says that wood products are particularly in demand in the Pacific Rim.    Korean-born Jaechul Ahn, a Minneapolis-based exporter of timber products, says he's running rings around his larger American competitors in sales to Korea, Taiwan and Japan. Basswood is particularly hot in Korea right now. He says he's been racking up basswood sales while his larger U.S. competitors have been holding on to their stocks, in hopes prices will rise.    Though he started his company only two years ago, he says he expects to have sales of between $2 million and $3.5 million this year.    Small companies, hankering for their first bits of export business, are calling up trade consultants for advice. Noor Doja, executive director of Minnesota's export finance authority, says the increase in such inquiries has been &quot;dramatic&quot; this year. He estimates that over the past 12 months or so, 200 to 300 businesses with sales of less than $10 million have dipped their toe in international waters for the first time. Those small concerns have accounted for &quot;virtually all&quot; of the companies that have joined the ranks of Minnesota's 1,000 exporters since last year, he adds.    What's driving this interest? Two factors, says Mr. Doja. First, there are the export benefits of the dollar's modest value in comparison to the early Reagan years. Secondly, entrepreneurs view exporting as a way to build profits that will carry them through the seasonal swings in their domestic markets.    Most of the Minnesota activity is coming from the state's major food and packaging industries, computer and software businesses, and medical equipment companies. But, Mr. Doja says, there's also growing interest from more off-beat enterprises, such as a fresh crayfish company in Duluth that ships to Sweden.    &quot;A few years ago, we would have laughed&quot; if a crayfish seller had asked the state for advice on marketing overseas, he says.    Still, there's a possibility that first-time exporters are feeling less adventurous now, than, say, a year ago. Hank Selby, who heads the Richmond, Va., branch of Schenkers International Forwarders Inc., says he had a lot more requests last year to put on trade seminars for small businesses. Export fervor ran high last year after the dollar reached its lowest level against the yen since the late 1940s. He says the slacker interest he sees from would-be, first-time exports these days probably reflects the 20% gain the dollar has shown against the yen since that low point in January 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
