Various cutoffvalues are used for the range of the Coulomb interactions. At very lowfrequency the integrated density of states shows a noninteger exponentwith values ranging from 0.75 to 1.55, depending on the cutoff valuefor the Coulomb interactions. We conclude that the cumulative densitiesof states in those molecules depend more on competing interactions thanon various proposed universal laws.</TEXT></DOC>
