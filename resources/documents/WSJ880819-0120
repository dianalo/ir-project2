The space shuttle Challenger exploded Jan. 28, 1986, when hot gasses escaped from a tiny gap in a faulty booster seal. Seven astronauts were killed and the shuttle fleet has been grounded ever since.    During yesterday's test, engineers drilled holes into the booster and intentionally left off critical adhesives in order to test whether the back-up seals would contain the leaking hot gasses. &quot;It was like a blowtorch&quot; on some of the seals, said Allan McDonald, vice president of space engineering for Morton Thiokol Inc., which makes the solid-rocket boosters for NASA and tests them.    The seals worked despite the intense heat and pressure, capping a poignant day for Mr. McDonald. The evening before the Challenger launch, he had argued furiously against launching because of his fears about the seals, called O-rings. But he was overruled by senior Morton Thiokol officials and NASA. Yesterday, he called the test &quot;the final test&quot; for the redesigned booster. &quot;We got an A-plus,&quot; he added.    Morton Thiokol tested the rocket booster in an arid patch of land in Promontory, Utah. The rocket fired for two minutes and eight seconds, sending up a billowing tower of green-tinged smoke. Shortly after the rocket stopped burning, Mr. McDonald and Mr. Mitchell climbed over it to see how well the rocket performed.    NASA's success yesterday follows by about a week a successful test firing of the shuttle Discovery's main engines, and reduces to a minimum the number of technical challenges facing the agency before it resumes shuttle launches. At Kennedy Space Center yesterday, a NASA spokesman said the workers were ahead of schedule repairing a small steering-rocket fuel line leak. For the first time, NASA is trying to accomplish this repair, which requires cutting into the shuttle, on the launch pad rather than rolling the spacecraft back to its hangar.    If NASA's luck continues and if it can avert a rollback, the space agency stands a reasonable chance of meeting its much-postponed goal of launching the Discovery at the end of September or early October. Still, the agency remained cautious yesterday and wouldn't venture a new target date for the launch. </TEXT></DOC>
