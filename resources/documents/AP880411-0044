On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Average of 225 selectedissues, which shed a modest 20.33 points Friday, gained 175.98points, or 0.65 percent, finishing the day at 26,924.87.   The dollar closed at 125.71 yen, up 0.53 yen from its close of125.18 yen Friday. It had opened the day at 125.80 yen, and tradedbetween 125.68-125.83 yen.   ``People are buying on an optimism based chiefly on the dollar'smovement,'' said Julian Jones, a broker at Vickers da Costa.   He attributed the U.S. currency's positive trend to Wednesday'santicipated meeting of monetary officials of the Group of Sevenmajor economic countries and Thursday's announcement of U.S. tradefigures for February.   The bullish movement is expected to continue for the rest of theday, Jones added.   An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo said thedollar's firmness also reflected last Friday's close in New York,when the dollar closed the week at 125.75 yen.   ``Otherwise, many market participants are taking a wait-and-seeposition prior to an announcement of U.S. trade figures forFebruary,'' he added, speaking on condition of anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
