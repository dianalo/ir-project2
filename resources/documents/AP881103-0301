R. Ross Johnson, president and chief executive officer of RJRNabisco, said in a two-paragraph statement that the management groupand its financial partners, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and SalomonInc., would offer stockholders $84 in cash and $8 worth ofsecurities for each Nabisco share outstanding.   ``This is a full and fair price for stockholders,'' Johnson said.``Our offer will be good for the company, its employees and thecommunities we serve because our management group would bring thecontinuity and knowhow needed to ensure the continued long-termsuccess of the business.''   The management group put RJR Nabisco into ``play'' when itannounced two weeks ago that it was considering a $75-a-share, or$17 billion, offer to take the company private.   Kohlberg Kravis, the nation's leading leveraged buyout firm,quickly followed with a tender offer to shareholders of $90 a share,worth an estimated $20.3 billion.   In a joint statement released shortly after Nabisco's bid wasannounced, Johnson and Kohlberg Kravis said talks about a possiblejoint bid had been terminated, although they left the door open to``further discussions.''   The two camps have talked off and on over the past two weekswithout success.   Speculation that RJR Nabisco's management would unveil a higherbid today had pushed up Nabisco stock $1.12{ a share beforeJohnson's announcement and it rose 37{ cents more to $88 after thestatement was released.   The Wall Street Journal had reported in today's editions that themanagement group was close to topping the Kohlberg Kravis bid.   The Journal said the group had talked with other food companiesand other investors, including Texas financier Robert Bass, aboutjoining in the bid.   In addition, the Journal and the Atlanta Constitution alsoreported that another leveraged buyout firm, Forstman Little andamp; Co.,was considering entering the battle.   The Journal gave no attribution for Forstmann Little's interestin bidding for RJR Nabisco, but said it was understood that theinvestment concern had signed a confidential agreement with RJRNabisco's board allowing it to analyze some confidential financialinformation.   RJR Nabisco's board issued a statement Wednesday inviting otherinterested parties to bid for the nation's 19th-largest industrialconcern, maker of such well-known brands as Winston cigarettes andOreo cookies.   Charles Hugel, who is chairman of the committee of outsidedirectors appointed to review takeover proposals, said the panelbelieved ``this will serve the best interest of all shareholders.''   The financial world had been stunned when RJR Nabisco'smanagement announced it was considering the leveraged buyout, thebiggest corporate transaction of its kind in U.S. history.   In a leveraged buyout, most of the purchase price is borrowedmoney that is repaid with the acquired company's cash flow or assetsales.   The leaders of Kohlberg Kravis reportedly have fought the RJRNabisco battle because they are intent on retaining the firm'spreeminence in leveraged buyouts.   But speculation has arisen that the firm might be under pressureto withdraw from the bidding. Several institutional investors in thefirm's leveraged buyout fund, which would provide a small part ofthe financing, are balking on the grounds that they believe thefirm's approach is hostile, even though it made its offer contingenton getting support from RJR Nabisco's board.</TEXT></DOC>
