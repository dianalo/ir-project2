This temperature rangeincludes regions where the silicates are solid and regions where theyare molten. As such, the program was divided into two phases: the firstphase involves the measurement of the electrical conductivity in themolten state up to 1500/sup 0/C, and the second phase involves the measurementof the electrical conductivity from 300/sup 0/C to the softening pointof the solid phase. This report covers the work carried out in Phase1 of the program. 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
