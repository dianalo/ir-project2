Trouble is, wool hasn't been listed as a strategicmaterial since 1960. Nonetheless, one sheepherder alone --the meatpacking giant Monfort Inc. -- has been collecting asmuch as $478,000 a year in price-support payments forshearing wool from lambs.</LP><TEXT>   To a growing number of lawmakers, such payments as theseexemplify the excesses of a national farm policy they believehas gone dreadfully awry. Few members of Congress are moreunhappy with government farm programs than conservativeRepublican Rep. Dick Armey of Texas and liberal DemocraticRep. Charles Schumer of New York. Though political oddfellows, they have begun building a political coalition inthe House to inject what Rep. Armey calls &quot;perestroika&quot; intoU.S. agriculture.   The wool and mohair program, as they see it, ranks as oneof Washington's more pointless endeavors. Says Rep. Schumer:&quot;It's a subsidy in search of a rationale.&quot; And if they havetheir way, it's a subsidy in danger of a heavy shearing.   Quietly and steadily, Reps. Schumer and Armey have beenrecruiting colleagues, tapping into bipartisan concern aboutrising food prices and growing impatience with perceivedinequities and inefficiencies in the commodity programs. Atthe same time, they are enlisting the support of consumeradvocates, who object to many farm-price supports as &quot;hiddentaxes&quot; on supermarket shoppers, and they are reaching out toenvironmentalists, who fault the farm programs for rewardingoveruse of pesticides and other harmful farming practices.   Once everybody is aboard, the coalition intends to weighin on the farm-bill debate, which has long been dominated bythe Agriculture Committee and a phalanx of lobbyists forcommodity groups. &quot;The vast majority of my constituents arebuying their groceries at the grocery store, not tilling thesoil,&quot; says Mr. Armey, son of a North Dakota farmer. &quot;Thefarm bill {should} be debated by not only people on thesupply side of the market, but by people on the demand sideas well.&quot;   Mr. Schumer, a Harvard-educated lawyer, and Mr. Armey, afree-market economist, make a formidable pair. Both areBudget Committee members, respected as inside players adeptat legislative accommodation. Mr. Armey has mellowed greatlysince his freshman days as a free-market firebrand. On thefarm front, he hopes to repeat his success in brokering anagreement on closing military bases.   The two men cast themselves as farm-program reformers, nothit men. &quot;We aren't trying to kill them,&quot; says Rep. Schumer.&quot;We're trying to fix them.&quot;   Their timing seems right. For one thing, the Farm Belt hasrecovered from the drought of 1988 and economic doldrums ofthe mid-1980s. Equally important, adds Rep. Armey, &quot;We havegotten four or five years away from those emotional movies{about farm foreclosures}.&quot;   What's more, demographic trends are working in thewould-be reformers' favor. The strength of the farm bloc hasbeen waning as the rural population declined. Only 46 of 435congressional districts are now truly agrarian, according toan Agriculture Department study. At the same time, thelongstanding accommodations between rural members andbig-city members, who need rural votes for food stamps andsocial programs, appear to be fraying of late.   Says John White, former chairman of the DemocraticNational Committee: &quot;The reality is that there's a greaterpossibility to change programs than ever before.&quot;   Given federal budget constraints, squabbles amongcommodity groups over their respective slices of a shrinkingsubsidy pie may further weaken some of the old alliances. Afew cracks already are showing in the farm bloc.   &quot;A corn-state guy came up to me the other day and said thepeanut program is the worst,&quot; Mr. Armey says. &quot;He tried topoint me off in that direction.&quot;   He and Mr. Schumer are sounding out like-minded members ofthe Senate about joining forces. But the chances of successthere aren't nearly as bright, if only because every memberrespresents at least some farm interests. Ultimately,everything may depend on how serious the Bush administrationis about holding down farm outlays and making agriculturemore market-oriented.   The Bush administration, in sending Congress a bundle of1990 farm-bill proposals, urged a $1.5 billion cutback incommodity subsidies next year and singled out severalprograms for overhauling. Two prime targets: wool-mohair andpeanuts. The price supports for both have been going up since1985, while corn, wheat and other crops have been takingcuts. The administration favors revamping both programs toput wool-mohair and peanuts on a par with other crops.   The peanut program is regarded by many as particularlyegregious. Because of its high price supports and tight lidon peanut production and imports, American consumers have topay higher prices for U.S. peanuts than foreigners do.   As for the wool and mohair program, it has been operatingin obscurity ever since Congress decided in 1954 that theslide in U.S. wool production had to be halted, mainlybecause the Pentagon needed woolen uniforms. A new GeneralAccounting Office report shows that wool production hascontinued to plummet despite years of incentive payments tosheepherders and ranchers. Last year, the government paid$3.04 for each additional pound of wool produced, $1.66 morethan the average market price.   &quot;What's particularly galling,&quot; says Mr. Schumer, &quot;is mostof them are raising sheep for meat purposes.&quot; A spokeman forMonfort, a ConAgra Inc. subsidiary, says that Monfort sharesits wool payments -- in 1988, they totaled $425,000 -- withranchers who raise lambs for its slaughterhouses.   The GAO report strongly questions the need for furtherpayments in an age of synthetic fibers, and reminds Congressof a legislative lapse: It never decided why mohairproduction should be subsidized at all, or why individualAngora goat ranchers should be paid as much as $300,000 ayear in mohair subsidies. And in an unusual letter toCongress, the agency lists numerous &quot;opportunities forchange&quot; in farm law, including elimination of wool-mohairprice supports.   One of the coalition's legislative planks would outlawpayments of any kind to farmers with incomes of $100,000 ayear or more. Says Rep. Armey: &quot;There's no reason we shouldbe subsidizing individuals who earn more than three times theaverage annual income of a family of four.&quot;   The coalition won't make any concerted move until the 1990farm bill reaches the House floor, probably early thissummer. In the meantime, the strategy is to have a bipartisanteam working on each commodity. New York Democratic Rep.Thomas Downey and Ohio Republican Rep. Willis Gradisonalready are pushing their bill to overhaul the sugarprice-support program.   Says Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Barney Frank: &quot;Some ofthe guys on the Agriculture Committee believe they face theirtoughest year ever.&quot;   ---                 Biggest 1986 Wool Payments*                                                                                                          Monfort Inc., Greeley, Colo. ................. $478,757   Triple E.
