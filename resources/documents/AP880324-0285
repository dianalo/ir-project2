(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists at GTE Corp. say a new laserthat can switch on and off a record 22 billion times per secondmarks a big step in the development of better televisions,computers and video telephones.   The tiny semiconductor laser developed at GTE Laboratories inWaltham, Mass., theoretically would be capable of sending 200 to400 video signals over an optical fiber simultaneously, the companysaid Wednesday.   GTE officials said the breakthrough increased the potential foruse of fiber optics _ now used mainly for carrying voice or data _for carrying video signals as well.   ``Your telephone is going to be a television, a computertelephone and a voice (transmitter) rolled into one,'' said LeslieRiseberg, director of electronics and photronics, the GTE labsdivision that developed the device.   GTE said it increased the laser's speed by decreasing the widthof the light-emitting region. It said the record topped its ownworld record of 18 billion cycles per second set in 1986.   The fibers, which are made of a flexible glass that transmitslight signals, gradually are replacing metal wires intelecommunications. Stronger and longer-lasting than metals,optical fibers also have the virtue of being able to carry far moresignals. But lasers needed to be created so the fibers couldachieve their potential.   The higher the laser speed, the more signals can be sent overthe optical fibers. For example, instead of getting 20 stations oncable television, a TV set could receive perhaps 400 channels at atime.   Riseberg said that in five to 10 years the faster laserdramatically could expand the nightly viewing menu.   ``Instead of there being a scheduled program on cable, we'relooking at technical improvements where you can pick out a videoand have it shown on your fiber,'' Riseberg said. ``Like a videojukebox.''   Optical fibers already connect the central offices of telephoneexchanges. In the future, the hair-thin strands may be be installedhouse-to-house and business-to-business, facilitating videotelephones and computers that converse with each other more rapidlythan they can over current conventional telephone lines with amodem.</TEXT></DOC>
