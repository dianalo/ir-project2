ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA engineers are focusing on a smallmisalignment of fuel tanks and spacecraft on two space shuttles asthey search for the elusive hydrogen leaks that have grounded theshuttle fleet.   The continuing mystery of the leaks is throwing the shuttleschedule into disarray and threatens to postpone at least twomissions this summer, officials said Monday.   Most of the 35 orbiter-tank combinations flown so far have hadsome misalignments, but the two found in the shuttles with theleaks are the largest to date, space flight director William B.Lenoir said.   ``One of the areas we are looking at is the angle of connectionbetween the external tank and the orbiter,'' Lenoir said. ``Ideallyyou think of them to be really aligned (but) it's never perfect,it's always some small degree of misalignment.''   Lenoir said the leak problem _ which shows up while the tank isbeing filled with supercold liquid hydrogen a few hours beforeflight _ must be fixed within a few weeks to keep NASA anywherenear its ambitious flight schedule.   The schedule called for a Columbia launch in May on an astronomymission, Atlantis in July, Columbia again in August and thenDiscovery in October.   The hydrogen leak on Columbia in May and the discovery last weekof a similar leak on Atlantis scrambled that schedule and Lenoirsaid it is unclear now if the agency can recover in time to fly allthe missions this year.   Discovery must go in October to take advantage of a planetaryalignment that occurs only once every two years. The shuttle'scargo is the Ulysses science probe that is to study the sun.   ``We're right on the edge of the point where two flights nolonger fit in the schedule before the launch of Ulysses,'' saidLenoir. Fixing the leak, he said, will have to be quick and simpleto avoid more changes in the NASA launch schedule.   The shuttle orbiter _ the airplane-like vehicle in whichastronauts fly _ is attached to the 154-foot-long fuel tank atthree points, two on the lower end and one on the upper.   Fuel flows from the tank to the orbiter's three engines througha 17-inch pipe that disconnects when the tank is empty and beginsits fall back to Earth.   One of the lower attachment points on Columbia's tank is .160 ofan inch higher than the other and the one on Atlantis is off by.150 of an inch, said shuttle boss Robert L. Crippen.   That small misalignment is well within the tolerance built intothe shuttle system, he said.   But whether that is enough of a deviance to put strain on thefuel line, also near the bottom of the tank, is being studied byone of the four teams NASA has set up to look into the problem.   Lenoir said he hoped to get some answers by Thursday. Parts ofColumbia are being tested in a laboratory. Atlantis was undergoingtests _ with helium substituting for the volatile liquid hydrogen _while still on the launch pad Monday, despite severe thunderstormsand high winds that raked the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.   ``We've been unable to say, `Hey, that's a problem area,'''Lenoir said. ``On the other hand, because of their coincidence weare not stopping there.''   NASA's science chief, Lennard Fisk, sought to put a brighterview on NASA's other headache, the faulty mirror on the $1.5billion Hubble Space Telescope that prevents the accurate focusingthat scientists sought.   ``There are two characteristics of the people who work forNASA,'' he said. ``We're stubborn and we're clever. We're going tomake this thing work.''   NASA is consulting with experts in image processing _ usingtechnology to enhance pictures received from the telescope.   ``There is growing optimism that we will be successful,'' Fisksaid. ``Six months from now, a year from now, I expect you all toooh and ahh over the picture that Hubble is going to produce and ofcourse, compliment the current management of NASA for their successin pulling it off.''</TEXT></DOC>
