Plunging into the final nine weeks of the neck-and-neck race forpresident, Bush turned up the rhetorical heat on Dukakis.   ``How gloomy he is'' about the economy, Bush said.   The vice president said that Dukakis' views on defense were``the standard litany of the liberal left'' and his attitude aboutnew weapons was ``governed by blind negative ideology.''   ``I wouldn't be surprised if he thinks a naval exercise issomething you find in Jane Fonda's workout book,'' Bush said. Ms.Fonda, an actress now best known for producing exercise books andvideotapes, infuriated many people during the Vietnam war bytraveling to Hanoi and posing with North Vietnamese militarypersonnel to dramatize her opposition to U.S. policy in SoutheastAsia.   Highlighting Bush's pro-defense stance, two aircraft carriersrested at anchor across the harbor as the vice president spoke to asun-drenched Labor Day audience of several hundred people outside awholesale fish company.   Bill Lacy, the head of Bush's campaign in California, said thevice president was trailing Dukakis in the state by three to sevenpoints.   Bush's appearance was marred by several dozen noisy protesterscarrying Dukakis-Bentsen signs and chanting, ``Where was George?''and ``Bush and Noriega.'' Employees of the fish company held upcardboard boxes to block the demonstrators from cameramen untilBush campaign aides ordered the shields taken down.   Meanwhile, the Secret Service and police said that a man with astun gun hanging from his belt was taken into custody.   ``Right now it appears there was no danger involved to the vicepresident,'' said Steve Sergek, the special agent in charge of theSan Diego field office of the U.S. Secret Service.   ``The person did nothing to present a harm to either the vicepresident or anyone else there,'' Sergek said.   Bush began the day by touring the Chesapeake Fish Co., a familyowned wholesale fish processing concern whose booming sales areattributed in part to heavy demand from sushi restaurants in thearea.   Later, he traveled to Anaheim, Calif., and gave a Disneylandsend-off to U.S. Olympic athletes headed for the Summer Games inSeoul, South Korea.   ``You're representing a country that is wide open and free as abreeze, where the millionaire has no more vote than the pauper andwhere even school children know the words: `I know my rights,'''Bush said, surrounded by the athletes and Disney characters.   The vice president rounded out the day by attending a holidaypicnic with Los Angeles policemen. ``I mean to win this election,''he declared.   Cheered by the lawmen and their families, Bush called fortougher sentences for criminals, including the death penalty forpeople convicted of killing police officers.   ``I will appoint to the federal bench judges who have a littlemore concern about the victims of crime and a little less concernabout the criminals,'' Bush said.   Bush told the San Diego audience, ``This campaign is about manythings, but if I had to set some priorities, I'd say (it is)foremost about jobs and peace. It's about protecting the gains thatwe've made in jobs and peace and it's about how to make newbreakthroughs in both areas.''   He credited the Reagan-Bush administration with creating 17{million new jobs since the end of the 1981-82 recession and scornedDukakis for the Massachusetts governor's criticism of the economy.   ``All my opponent can do is try to tell the American people howbad everything is,'' Bush said.   On the subject of crime, Bush said Dukakis would turn the clockback to ``the fuzzy old days of liberal thinking'' when theperpetrators of crime, rather than its victims, were viewed withmore compassion.   ``To the people of California, let me put it this way: If youloved Rose Bird, you'll love my opponent. They oppose the deathpenalty, no matter how brutal the crime that's been committed.''   Bush was referring to the State Supreme Court chief justice whowas voted off the bench by California's voters in a campaign thathighlighted Ms. Bird's liberal views on criminal matters.   Bush also lambasted the prison furlough program in Massachusettsand said that ``no more furloughs for people who rape, pillage andplunder in the United States.''   On defense matters, Bush criticized Dukakis for opposing the MXand Midgetman missiles, the Strategic Defense Intiaitive and twonew aircraft carriers.   ``We've got to look at every new idea and every defense systemfrom the point of view of, `will it work, does it make sense and dowe need it to make our country safer?   ``If the answers are `yes,' then at least it warrants our mostserious attention and then sorting out our financial priorities,''Bush said. ``We can't just dismiss every new idea with a breezy,`We already have enough weapons.'''   On pocketbook issues, he said that his primary goal will be toprovide a job to all Americans. Bush pledged anew to resist anymove in Congress to increase federal spending and governmentregulation of business.   ``And when they say I'll raise taxes, I will say no, and they'llpush, and I'll say no again, and they'll push again, and finallyI'll say: `Read my lips _ no new taxes.''   ``Why do you think they call it Taxachusetts?'' Bush said,referring to state tax increases in Massachusetts under Dukakis.   Underscoring the importance of California in the White Housesweepstakes, and its cache of 47 Electoral College votes _ thebiggest prize in the country _ Bush said, ``It's going to be along, tough fight,'' and added: ``California, here I come.''</TEXT></DOC>
