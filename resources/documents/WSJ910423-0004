Climbing into his BMW, the Chamber of Commerce presidentstraps a dagger to the belt of his crisp white robe andrewraps his mauve headscarf. Then, speeding down a spotlesshighway, he brakes at the sight of a dingy office building.&quot;Needs paint,&quot; he says with a frown. Stopping for gasoline,Mr. Sultan instinctively checks the hood -- not for oil, butfor dust. &quot;Our government,&quot; he says, gazing at a nearbycarwash, &quot;is very fussy about appearances.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   So fussy, in fact, that Omanis can be fined for driving adirty car or leaving a building unpainted. Office workers canbe docked for not wearing traditional garb -- a robe andsashlike turban, with daggers de rigueur for officialmeetings. Air conditioners must be concealed with woodenlattices, construction sites and laundry lines must beshielded from view. Muscat even provides drawings for awooden laundry screen that homeowners can build themselves.   Such a passion for the pristine wouldn't seem shocking inScandinavia. But in a region of the world renowned for dust,discord and dubious plumbing, this small Arab nation is ablinding oasis of order.   &quot;It's hard to believe you're in the Middle East,&quot; saysDieter Christensen, a Columbia University ethnomusicologistdoing research in Oman. &quot;People even obey traffic rules. It'seerie.&quot;   It's also, at times, a bit too antiseptic. Touring thenarrow alleys of Muscat's well-swept souk, Mr. Christensenstops to have a silver ring repaired. Without asking, thecraftsman finishes the job by scouring decades of grime fromthe jewelry. &quot;I think it had more character before,&quot; theprofessor says with a sigh.   Life in Muscat, a capital city of 300,000, wasn't alwaysso unsullied. A 19th century Englishman described the tradingport as &quot;ill-built, crowded, not over-clean.&quot; In the 1960s,Muscat remained a walled backwater with only six miles ofpaved roads and a sultan so medieval that he forbade Western&quot;corruptions&quot; such as riding bicycles and wearing sunglasses.   Then, in 1970, the sultan's son, Qaboos bin Said, seizedpower in a bloodless coup and set about modernizing hiskingdom -- and prettifying it. Now, all new structures --even bus shelters -- must incorporate Islamic architecturalfeatures, such as domes and arches. Homes can only be paintedin traditional, pastel colors.   To ensure that his edicts are obeyed, Sultan Qaboos(pronounced like the last car of a train) sometimes tours hisrealm surreptitiously, usually at night, checking roadsidedecorations -- urns of flowers and replicas of oversizedincense burners and coffee pots -- and ordering eyesoresdemolished. &quot;Ugliness of any kind distresses him,&quot; says RalphDaly, a Scotsman who advises the palace on conservation andthe environment.   The British-educated sultan, always sartoriallyresplendent, sometimes in gold-braided cape and tassled,rainbow-colored turban, was unavailable for comment. But Mr.Daly and other acquaintances describe him as a cultured,carefully groomed ruler with a taste for choral music and alove of horses, seashells and flowers.   Unlike other Arab leaders, who dot the landscape withmilitary monuments and portraits of themselves, the50-year-old Omani sultan prefers floodlit waterfallscascading down the seaside cliffs, and sculptures of desertantelope feeding on Muscat's volcanic rock. Muscat appears tohave more roadside benches than Yellowstone. And litterbugs,of course, are harshly punished: a $50 fine on first offense,imprisonment on the second.   Sultan Qaboos, says Mr. Daly, &quot;is that rare Arab leaderwho looks at a landscape as something more than good or badgrazing land.&quot; Though arid, Muscat is lush withfoliage-watered with treated effluent. Appropriately, theWorld Federation of Rose Societies recently named a newlybred flower after the sultan.   The sultan is fortunate in possessing oil wells, and alsoin attracting like-minded officials to carry out his campaignfor clean. Muscat's top health official, Said Amor, pledgesto make Oman &quot;the Singapore of the Middle East.&quot;   The bespectacled inspector knows of what he speaks; hehoneymooned in the Asian nation in 1977 and has been tryingto impose severe Singaporese standards on Muscat ever since.Making his rounds in a fuel-injection Volvo, the healthofficial stops at Muscat's sprawling fish market, whereturbaned anglers once slapped tuna and squid down on a pebblybeach, and sold their catch open-air.   Now, thanks to Mr. Amor, the fish repose in a tidypavilion, shielded from the sun and drenched with tap waterto keep from spoiling. The floor is hosed and swept, anddisinfected at day's end with pine-oil. Khaki-clad inspectorspatrol the market, making sure that fishermen don't revert toold habits.   &quot;We still have some problems with odor,&quot; Mr. Amor says,shaking his head as a fisherman tosses a spoiled sardine fromboat to beach. Mr. Amor's newest scheme: encouragingfishermen to lay their catch on beds of broken ice. &quot;Muchprettier,&quot; he explains. &quot;More hygienic.&quot;   These finer touches seem lost, however, on many fishermen,who continue to slog barefoot through piles of gutted fish,and who have a colorful -- and doubtless unhygienic -- habitof stashing their earnings beneath their turbans, to keep thebills dry.   Otherwise, Muscat has been completely sanitized. Thetraveler in search of Cairo's gritty bustle, or the color andmayhem of Marrakesh, will find this Arab city wanting. Whatbustle exists in Muscat's bazaar is largely devoted tosweeping (twice a day, by an army of street cleaners). ThePortuguese fortresses that flank Muscat's half-moon harborare so well-preserved and finely lighted as to seem morefairytale than real. And the only unwashed surface in sightis the face of the cliff where 19th-century sailors scrawledthe names of visiting ships.   &quot;I'm surprised the Omanis haven't whitewashed that, too,&quot;says a diplomat at a harbor-side embassy. &quot;They hategraffiti.&quot;   If Muscat's shimmer disappoints tourists, few Omanis seemto care. Until the late 1980s, Oman allowed no tourists atall, fearful of the garish commercialism tourism so oftenbreeds. &quot;We don't want Oman to become like Disneyland,&quot;explains Mr. Amor.   There seems little danger of that. Nor did the Gulf war,and an influx of U.S. forces into Muscat, muss Oman's hairtoo much. The sultanate played a crucial role in allowing theU.S. to preposition equipment and use its airstrips. Omaniforces also joined Desert Storm. But the country weatheredthe conflict well out of missile range.   Now, with the war over and with Muscat's beautificationvirtually complete, officials can turn their attention toOman's vast, untidy interior.   In the mountain town of Nakhl, an hour's drive west ofMuscat, the cramped streets are thick with trash, the carsdusty, the mudwalled homes unpainted. But even here, thegovernment is making inroads. &quot;Don't Litter -- Keep Your TownClean]&quot; says a poster beside a schoolyard, where studentsplay soccer with soda cans. On the unpaved road winding fromtown, there are green trash barrels, public toilets, andexperimental date-palm saplings enclosed with protective wiremesh.   &quot;We are getting more like Muscat every day,&quot; says MohamedJaffer, an elementary school principal. Mr. Jaffer evenconfesses, rather sheepishly, that he recently enclosed theair conditioner at his home with the required woodenlatticework. But then, Nakhl's 20,000 people still are someway from becoming city slickers.   &quot;Muscat has hundreds of people picking up trash,&quot; Mr.Jaffer says. &quot;Here, we still depend on goats.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
