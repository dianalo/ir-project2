The Senate is expected to follow suit soon, but the agreement's fate is uncertain because of opposition in Canada.    The House vote was 366-40. The trade agreement, to take effect Jan. 1, would gradually eliminate all tariffs and numerous other trade barriers between the two countries. It would set up a dispute-resolution mechanism and establish negotiations to try to eliminate trade subsidies in both countries.    The Senate Finance Committee approved the legislation yesterday by unanimous voice vote. Senate floor approval is likely in September.    President Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney signed the pact early this year, but it requires approval by Congress and the Canadian Parliament. Last month, the Liberal Party majority in the Canadian Senate decided to block the agreement, which could force Mr. Mulroney to put the issue to the voters. </TEXT></DOC>
