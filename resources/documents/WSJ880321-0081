Trying to peddle his chickens, he attracts a trail of kids as he wanders through the fairgrounds each fall with his rubber chicken, Henrietta, under his arm. What Ronald McDonald is to hamburgers and Aunt Jemima is to syrup, Bo Pilgrim -- like rival poultry pitchman Frank Perdue -- is to chickens. Thanks to the down-home-style commercials for his Pilgrim's Pride Corp., the white-haired chicken man has become a household name in Texas and Southern U.S. markets.    The 59-year-old Mr. Pilgrim, though, doesn't enjoy the same kind of popularity among Pilgrim's Pride stockholders, other chicken producers, or Wall Street.    Some holders were angered by Mr. Pilgrim's agreement, aborted last Thursday, to sell his 80% stake in the company to Tyson Foods Corp., the nation's No. 1 chicken producer, for $9 a share, or $162 million. Pilgrim's stock had risen as high as $7.125 after the offer was announced, but settled to $5, down $1.25, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday. The agreement, which Mr. Pilgrim says Tyson called off, would have left holders, who weren't included in the deal, &quot;high and dry,&quot; one analyst says.    For their part, other chicken producers blame &quot;good ole Bo&quot; for much of the industry over-expansion that left them swimming in red ink. And some Wall Street analysts criticize Mr. Pilgrim for embarking on a poorly timed and expensive push into new markets against well-entrenched chicken producers with deep pockets. Bo Pilgrim's risky strategy, they contend, left the company with heavy debt and plummeting profits that now threaten the chicken producer's survival. &quot;He may be hard-pressed to survive if the cycle stays weak into 1989,&quot; says John McMillin of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.    An optimist, Mr. Pilgrim doesn't think his company is about to crack up. But he longs for the days when producing profits was as easy as producing chickens. After three quarters of declining profits, Pilgrim's, in its first quarter ended Jan. 2, reported a loss before an extraordinary item of about $5.3 million on sales of $98.5 million. After an accounting change, Pilgrim's reported net income was about $4.2 million. The company will probably lose money in the current quarter, says Mr. Pilgrim, chairman and chief executive officer.    Mr. Pilgrim says he's not shopping the company. But his decision to sell his stake illustrates how bad business has become -- and how badly his strategy backfired.    Trying to become a full-line producer, Mr. Pilgrim tripled his advertising budget last year and made an aggressive push into frozen processed chicken, branded fresh chicken for retail meat counters, and the fast-food restaurant business. But other chicken producers, which generally specialize in one or two of those markets, had large positions that proved impregnable.    &quot;It was a strategy that set him apart from the industry. It was more venturesome and higher risk,&quot; says John Bierbusse of A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons. Today, though, Mr. Pilgrim &quot;has probably got no choice but to look for another bidder,&quot; says Prudential-Bache's Mr. McMillin.    Mr. Pilgrim's strategy might have worked if the chicken market hadn't begun to crumble at the same time. About a year ago, skyrocketing growth in production far surpassed consumer demand, and prices plummeted as much as 30% in three months in some markets.    The one strategy for which everyone praises Mr. Pilgrim is his popular promotional advertising campaign. In addition to the commercials, Mr. Pilgrim speaks at about 200 gatherings a year -- from business lunches to Easter egg hunts. And he knows how to add a homey touch: He hand-printed his latest annual stockholders' letter on a brown paper bag.    Mr. Pilgrim's TV debut didn't come easily, though. Until 1981, when his advertising agency talked him into making public appearances and commercials, he had never made a speech or a sales call, says George Arnold, partner of Evans Dallas Inc., which had the account at the time. &quot;He was very shy,&quot; says Mr. Arnold.    All that has changed, however, and today Bo Pilgrim is one of the slickest promoters around, wrapping his sales pitches up with free enterprise, the family and other down-home values. He appears at civic functions in Pittsburg, Texas, where his company is based, and often donates chickens for community fund-raisers.    Mr. Pilgrim started raising chickens in his grandmother's back yard when he was 12. In 1945, at age 17, he and his brother, who died in 1966, bought a farm supply business that sold chicks and feed. They added feed mills and hatcheries and in 1960 opened their first processing plant.    At that time, the company processed about 16,000 chickens a day, and raised 12,000 of them. Today, the company processes about one million chickens a day and raises all of them through contract growers, making Pilgrim's the sixth or seventh largest producer in the country. </TEXT></DOC>
