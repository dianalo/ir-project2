MILLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associted Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>AFABET, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Just south of this neat town built ofrock and adobe are towers of sandstone boulders hundreds of feethigh, where the people take cover during daylight in case ofbombing raids.   ``We cannot stay down there during the day,'' said MariamTeglest, 32, a soldier's widow with three children. ``It is muchtoo dangerous when the planes fly.''   She was speaking of Soviet-built MiG fighter-bombers of theEthiopian air force, which had bombed the town of about 20,000people twice in a few months.   Afabet is one of a dozen or so major towns in Eritrea,Ethiopia's northernmost province, where rebels have fought forindependence since 1961. Rebel forces captured the town inFebruary, early in their biggest offensive of the war.   The conflict began 29 years ago as a small uprising by scatteredguerrilla bands and has grown into a toe-to-toe slugging match byarmies of thousands of soldiers armed with heavy artillery, tanksand other modern weapons.   It is a war the Eritreans appear on the verge of winning,despite the Ethiopian military's total dominance of the sky and itsvast superiority in manpower. The government has a military forceof about 320,000 men, largest in black Africa.   The Eritreans do not divulge the size of their army. TheInternational Institute for Strategic Studies in London says30,000, but some recent visitors to the region believe the truestrength is double that or more.   In three decades, the war has touched almost every part of thisbarren, mountainous province the size of England.   Afabet is tucked into a desert valley that evokes the AmericanSouthwest. Here and elsewhere, people hide by day and work by nightin caves or camouflaged stone buildings and under the spreadingbranches of the ubiquitous African thorn tree.   ``We've created the world's largest underground economy,'' saidHaile Menkerios, a Harvard-educated economist, grinning at his playon words. He is on the Central Committee of the rebel EritreaPeople's Liberation Front.   ``We've learned not to expose ourselves,'' he said, with a sweepof the arm that covered hills dotted with cave mouths and stonehuts almost undiscernible from a few yards.   Eighty miles north of Afabet is Orota, the main rebel base camp.It sprawls through a deep, narrow valley cross-hatched by canyonsand surrounded by rugged peaks so high the sun reaches in for onlya few hours a day.   Enemy planes fly into this maze at great peril.   Orota is a supply and military training base, site of adetention center for thousands of prisoners of war, a civilian andan army hospital, schools for children of soldiers, manufacturingplants and repair shops for trucks, tanks and other militaryvehicles.   The hospitals stretch for three miles down the main valley, toreduce the threat from bombing. Wards and operating theaters arehidden in tents under thorn trees, in caves and in nearly invisiblebuildings hewn from the same sandstone as the surrounding mountains.   ``I think Frank Lloyd Wright would be proud of us,'' saidMenkerios, grinning again at his reference to the architect whobelieved buildings should harmonize with their natural surroundings.   A pharmaceutical factory, hidden in caves, makes everything fromsaline solutions to malaria pills and sanitary pads for women.   One in four rebel soldiers is a woman, many of them commandersin an army with no ranks or sex discrimination.   Everything in Orota is powered by electrical generators, most ofwhich are cranked up only after sundown, when the vast camp stirsto life.   Soviet-made field telephones captured from the Ethiopiansconnect the scattered complex. They look like early Edison models,but they work.   Nearly everything is captured, scavenged, donated or handmade bya people used to getting by on next to nothing. This province onthe Red Sea is one of the poorest in one of the world's poorestnations.   Nothing is thrown away. Artillery shell casings filled with sandand welded together form the supporting pillars of a new school.Disposable hypodermic syringes become light switches. Old tractorand truck tires are turned into wash troughs.   The Eritreans claim that they do not have the support of foreigngovernments and that all their military hardware, from tanks toKalashnikov assault rifles, has been captured from the Ethiopianarmy.   Officials and some diplomats in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital,say the Eritreans have received arms and money from several Arabcountries around the Red Sea that oppose the Soviet-suppliedgovernment of President Mengistu Haile Mariam. Eritrea's populationis split about 50-50 between Moslems and Christians.   A few reporters allowed behind rebel lines in recent months sawnothing but old and often battered Soviet-made military equipment.   Nothing in Orota except the crowded hospitals suggests the hugebattles being waged around Asmara, the Eritrean capital, a 16-hourdrive south over rutted trails even experienced drivers can lose inthe dark.   On a roughly north-south line running nearly 100 miles betweemAsmara and the sea, the rebels are fighting more than a third ofEthiopia's armed forces, mostly conscripted and poorly trainedyoung men.   At the beginning of their February offensive, the rebelssurrounded and cut off Asmara, including an estimated 1 millioncivilians and the government's 120,000-man 2nd Revolutionary Army.   Three times since early April, the 2nd Army pushed eastward inan attempt to recapture its nearest outlet to safety, the Red Seaport of Massawa. Each time, an Eritrean force no more than half thesize stopped it cold.   Reporters who visited Massawa in late April could hear thethunder of artillery and tank barrages day and night at the front40 miles away. The fierce exchanges often made windows rattle.   The rebels claim they killed, wounded or captured 30,000Ethiopian soldiers when they took Massawa in a three-day battle inearly February and have inflicted similar casualties along theGhinda front.   Journalists who have seen the remains of Massawa, been guidednear the front by the rebels and talked with deserters fromMengistu's army believe the numbers are not greatly exaggerated.   Whatever the number of dead and wounded on either side, theEthiopian 2nd Army's inability to break out of Asmara illustratesthe rebels' military prowess.   Most of Mengistu's other forces are occupied far to the south inthe neighboring provinces of Tigre, Wollo and Gonder with anuprising by the smaller Tigre People's Liberation Front.   The Tigreans, known to coordinate military moves with theEritreans, have spent 15 years fighting to overthrow Mengistu andestablish a new national government.   Eritrean fighters and their leaders predict the long war willend in a few months.   ``Come back soon,'' said Asmellash Abraha, who was detached fromother duties to play host to three visting journalists. ``I'll showyou Asmara. I am anxious to see it myself. It's been a long, longtime since I was last there.''</TEXT></DOC>
