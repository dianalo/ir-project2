LOUIS -- There are close friends who have never heard Richard Gephardt yell, never seen him cry. They have sighted him in blue jeans maybe twice in the last decade.    Self-control. That's the steel behind the Huck Finn grin. This presidential candidate is as earnest as an Eagle Scout, upbeat as a Rotarian. But Dick Gephardt always knows exactly where he's going. He calculates the odds. He focuses on results. He doesn't have unguarded moments.    Edward Ruesing, an old friend here, recalls 6 a.m. runs with then-alderman Gephardt in Forest Park. Others in the group might show up in grubby sweatshirts. &quot;But Dick always wore white tennis shorts and a polo shirt. My God! He's very circumspect. He's very conscious of the need to look sober and be sober.&quot;    Albert &quot;Red&quot; Villa, a canny old pol holding court beside a brass spittoon, sums up the clean-scrubbed &quot;kid&quot; who was once his fellow alderman. &quot;Classy. He never let his mouth get out of line.&quot;    Mr. Gephardt's wife Jane notes that critics &quot;call Dick a technocrat. It's not always been easy for him to open up and let people in.&quot;    The innate reserve occasionally cracks. It happened when his son Matthew, then two years old, was fighting for his life with cancer. Nurses kept waking the little boy for tests. Finally something snapped in the father stationed just outside. &quot;If you go in there,&quot; he warned a nurse, &quot;I'm gonna knock you out.&quot;    But that was an aberration. &quot;Dick doesn't get highs and lows like the rest of us,&quot; says Oklahoma Democratic Rep. Mike Synar, a friend and backer. &quot;He's like the star quarterback -- steady. The team knows he's the best hope they've got.&quot;    So the central questions about Dick Gephardt concern not his head but his heart. Not his competence but what, exactly, he'd risk that competence for.    He has pioneered advanced positions on trade, tax revision, arms control and the rural crisis. Yet he has been accused of pandering to interest groups, and his follow-through has been faulty at times. The Bradley-Gephardt proposal was the catalyst for sweeping tax revision in 1986. Yet Mr. Gephardt was a secondary player in the final battles, preoccupied with the Gramm-Rudman budget-cutting fight and his own presidential ambitions.    The early Dick Gephardt addressed anti-abortion groups, told the House that &quot;life . . . begins with conception,&quot; and supported a Human Life constitutional amendment. It played well in his Catholic district. But he abandoned the amendment, while still opposing abortion, as he moved toward his presidential bid.    After nearly 11 years in the House, Mr. Gephardt is a legislator's legislator. &quot;He'd be a natural Speaker,&quot; says Colorado Democratic Sen. Timothy Wirth. A top Reagan adviser calls Mr. Gephardt &quot;one of the few guys in Congress who brings votes to the table.&quot; Backers describe him as the &quot;best listener in Congress.&quot; The question is whether he can go beyond listening -- to lead.    Critics see a man without convictions. &quot;Dick's not a risk-taker,&quot; says former Pennsylvania Rep. Bob Edgar, a liberal Democrat working for candidate Paul Simon. &quot;On a scale of zero to five, he's about zero.&quot;    &quot;A piece of wet soap,&quot; says Kathy Wise, an anti-abortion activist for Missouri Citizens for Life. &quot;You put your finger on him and he just slips over to a new position.&quot;    But 70 House colleagues, people who have seen him perform day in and day out, tell another story. They have endorsed him, and many are actively campaigning for him. They praise his competence. That's a vivid contrast with Gary Hart, who was widely disparaged by colleagues even at the height of his public popularity.    Mike Synar can recall the exact occasion -- a night flight to Washington years ago -- when he decided Dick Gephardt ought to be president. Matt Gephardt had beaten cancer by then. But in the darkened cabin Dick Gephardt talked of the long family ordeal -- of how, anxious to learn anything to help his son, he once sought out a top surgeon, scrubbed up with him, worked beside him for a day and a night.    &quot;Dick's great strength is his ability to bring opposing parties together,&quot; says Rep. Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) &quot;He listens, he keeps on listening. He'd be better at working with Congress than anybody.&quot;    Rep. Gephardt is, at age 46, the embodiment of the cool, post-Watergate politician. His hair never seems ruffled; his tie would no doubt hang straight down in a typhoon. Yet he springs from the gritty, almost tribal world of south St. Louis.    South St. Louis is a web of working-class, Roman Catholic neighborhoods. The Hill is Italian. Dogtown is Irish. (The name isn't a slur on the Irish. Dogtown was built upon land occupied by a living exhibit of dog-eating Pacific islanders during the 1904 world's fair.) But Germans predominate. Scrubby Dutch, they call themselves, from a tradition of scrubbing their sidewalks clean. Dick Gephardt, although himself a Baptist, is Scrubby Dutch.    He's an Eagle Scout who sounds like one. &quot;Everything in life is attitude,&quot; he says as his car glides through a luminous Midwestern twilight. &quot;It's important to be positive about everything you do.&quot;    The squeaky-clean image makes even his old political mentor a bit uneasy. &quot;I've tried to figure out what his weaknesses are,&quot; says retired Missouri Rep. Richard Bolling. &quot;I can't come up with anything. It sort of bothers me, because I don't believe in perfection.&quot;    Mr. Bolling studied Congressman-elect Gephardt in late 1976 the way an investor might weigh a stock. What he liked then was the same quality that makes Mr. Gephardt's detractors suspicious now -- a tendency to change as he went along.    The Bolling philosophy holds that there are only a few fundamental issues that permit no compromise. &quot;On most things there are always about five or six legitimate positions.&quot; More important than precise position, most times, is an ability to grow. To &quot;do something.&quot;    His mentor's advice clearly dovetailed with Mr. Gephardt's own temperamental bent. &quot;He's a consensus politican, not a guerrilla warfare guy,&quot; sums up adviser John Bowles of Connecticut.    A President Gephardt would use Mr. Bolling as a sounding board. Other trusted friends include Edward Ruesing, the old running partner who now heads Downtown St. Louis Inc.; Richard Moe, who was Vice President Walter Mondale's chief of staff; and Missouri Rep. Ike Skelton, with whom he has car-pooled during all his House years.    But old friends would probably count for less in a Gephardt White House than they did under Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. Reaching out for advice comes instinctively to him; making choices comes harder. &quot;If I have a criticism of Dick, it's that it's difficult for him to make that final decision,&quot; says Rep. Synar. &quot;He doesn't want to alienate people.&quot;    Sometimes, in fact, Mr. Gephardt has come perilously close to playing both ends against the middle. In 1984, for example, he was running for the Democratic Caucus chairmanship, the fourth-ranking party leadership position. But at the same time he was listening sympathetically to a group of young Democrats who met regularly to complain about the party's ranking leader, then-Speaker Thomas O'Neill. Some firebrands urged him to run against Tip O'Neill or then-Majority Leader James Wright.    Mr. Gephardt prudently declined -- and apparently went further. &quot;I may have told Tip&quot; about the meetings, he concedes. &quot;All running would have done is make everybody excited, everybody angry,&quot; he says. Instead, Mr. Gephardt relayed the gripes to the Speaker. The Young Turks won some concessions. And Tip O'Neill would become the warmest of Gephardt champions.    The weakness of the accommodationist approach is that some issues, like abortion, simply defy compromise. Mr. Gephardt's attempt at middle ground -- which he calls a change in tactics, not convictions -- has enraged &quot;pro-life&quot; activists without entirely reassuring the &quot;pro-choice&quot; side.    Mr. Gephardt's finest hour came last year, as House Democrats scrambled to forge a unified response to the Gramm-Rudman budget-cutting bill. Recalls Rep. Synar: &quot;He just basically took over.&quot;    The result was a Democratic formula, supported by all party factions, that cushioned social programs while making deeper defense cuts. To put it together, Mr. Gephardt sat in on an eye-glazing 100 or more meetings over two weeks. &quot;It was nonstop,&quot; he says. &quot;It's one of the reasons I get this rap that I dropped the ball on tax reform.&quot;    There is -- at least when Mr. Gephardt talks about the process -- something exciting, almost mystical, about &quot;putting people in a room, keeping 'em in a room, pounding on 'em.&quot; But a president can't get everybody into The Room. Thus the questions: Can Mr. Inside become Mr. Outside? Can Dick Gephardt inspire?    Nobody will try harder than this man, who has already spent 47 days in Iowa this year; who sounds like a clean-cut high school coach, exhorting his team -- the battered U.S.A. -- at half time. (&quot;We're not getting it done! We can do it!&quot;) All that iron discipline can do, he will do.    Asked to sum up her boss, Joyce Aboussie, his Missouri campaign director, recalls the time she plunked down a huge stack of photos before Mr. Gephardt. Her assignment: One autographed photo for each of 65 volunteers. He began: &quot;Dick Gephardt . . . Dick Gephardt. . . .&quot; Eventually he had signed 65.    &quot;You can stop now,&quot; she told him.    &quot;I want to win this thing,&quot; he replied. And he ripped off 20 autographs more.    ---   IN BRIEF   Richard Gephardt   -- 46 YEARS OLD   --MARRIED 21 YEARS, 3 CHILDREN    -- NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAWSCHOOL   -- DEMOCRAT OF MISSOURI   St. Louis Board of Aldermen 1971 to 1976; U.S. congressman 1977 to present; chairman of House Democratic Caucus 1985 to present.
