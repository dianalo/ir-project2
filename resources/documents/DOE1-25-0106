<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-25-0106 </DOCNO><TEXT>A number of experimental high resolution seismic reflection surveys havebeen carried out in the Sydney Basin, using 48 trace IFP recording equipmentwith one millisecond sampling, single detectors per trace and small explosivecharges. Generally the dominant frequency of the reflected pulse is about120 Hz, but it can be as high as 160 Hz under favourable conditions.Wind is the most common source of noise and even low levels can seriouslyreduce signal-to-noise ratios because of the small explosive chargesused. The most successful solution has been to record when the wind noiseis minimal, such as very early in the morning. Although the resolutionobtained is still not sufficient to define small faults, it still providesinformation not easily obtained with other seismic methods. This includesthe resolution of the direction of movement with individual large faults,the determination of the separation between closely spaced faults andchanges in roof conditions. 15 refs., 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
