Flight 1141, carrying 108 people, rolled from side to side andgot no more than 30 feet off the runway before crashing Aug. 31 ontakeoff in a grassy field near the runway.   The airline said Wednesday that the members of the flight crew``are no longer flying with Delta.''   The crew members were fired Tuesday after being called to theDelta chief pilot's office in Dallas, said Capt. Jim Gray, spokesmanfor the Air Line Pilots Association.   Larry Davis, the pilot, and Steven Judd, the flight engineer, hadno comment Wednesday on Delta's announcement, said women answeringtelephones at their Dallas-area homes. No phone listing was foundfor co-pilot Carey Wilson Kirkland Jr.   Delta spokesman Jim Lundy said the airline's investigation wasconducted separately from a National Transportation Safety Boardprobe of the crash. He said Delta expects the NTSB to release itsconclusions in late summer or early fall.   In NTSB hearings in November, the three crew members admittedcertain technical violations of Delta regulations had occurred asthey prepared for takeoff, but said they made all necessarypre-flight preparations.   Attorneys for crash victims said they were glad Delta acceptedblame for the crash but added that doesn't mean their clients' legalaction is finished.   ``It will certainly expedite the cases,'' said Windle Turley, aDallas lawyer representing at least eight passengers who were aboardDelta Flight 1141. ``If a case was going to take 18 months maybe nowit will be done in a year.''</TEXT></DOC>
