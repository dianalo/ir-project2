This privilege is grantedif the Secretary of Commerce finds and advises the Secretary of the Treasurythat the country in which the foreign aircraft is registered allows substantiallyreciprocal privileges to U.S. registered aircraft. Section 10.59(f), CustomsRegulations (19 CFR 10.59(f)), lists those countries whose aircraft havebeen found to be entitled to these privileges.In accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1309(d), the Secretary of Commerce found andconveyed to the Customs Service, effective December 5, 1988, that Turkeywill grant to American operators of U.S. registered aircraft, exemptionfrom customs duties and related taxes on aircraft supplies and equipmentneeded to support commercial aviation flights into an out of Turkey, ina manner that is substantially reciprocal to exemption privileges whichthe United States may provide, under 19 USC andSection;andSection;309 and 317,and under 26 USC 4221, to operators of foreign registered aircraft. Thisdocument amends andSection;10.59(f), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 10.59(f)),by changing the list of countries whose aircraft are exempt from the paymentof Customs duties and internal revenue taxes on supplies and equipmentwithdrawn from Customs or internal revenue custody for use by aircraftto indicate that Turkey has been granted an exemption regarding aircraftsupplies and ground support equipment.Authority to sign an amendment to this section has been delegated to theChief, Regulations and Disclosure Law Branch.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>This document does not meet the criteria for a ``major rule'' as definedin section 1(b) of E.O. 12291.

As Turkey is currently extending exemption privilegesregarding supplies and ground support equipment to United States aircraft,a delayed effective date is not appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of this document was Peter T.
