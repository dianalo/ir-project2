For example, governmentsubsidies to farmers that were unthinkable when agriculturewas a big part of the economy become possible when farmersare few. This law now threatens to undermine the free-tradingsystem that has served the West so well for 40 years.   The problem is a crazy-house of farm subsidies and tradebarriers, especially in the European Community. The U.S.,backed by Australia, Canada and most everyone else, wants toput world agriculture trade on a more sensible, free-marketfooting. The EC countries, especially France and Germany, areresisting. If progress isn't made at this week's Houstonsummit of industrial nations, the issue could scuttle theUruguay Round of trade-opening talks that is supposed to endthis year.</LP><TEXT>   This truly is a case of the many held hostage by the few.By one measure, farming accounted for only 2.7% of theEuropean economy in 1987 but last year cost EC consumers andtaxpayers some $93 billion in subsidy. The result is lakes ofwine, mountains of cheese and other European delights.Jacques Delors, the EC president who may be the world's lastsocialist, nonetheless intends to explain in Houston thatthis can't be changed because European farming is somehowdifferent. If he means economically bizarre, he's right.   The U.S. is also a sinner, to be sure, with subsidies,quotas and &quot;marketing orders&quot; of its own. The U.S.Agriculture Department figures farm subsidy and protectioncost Americans some $38 billion in 1986, or $681 for everynon-farm household. But at least the U.S. wants to point theworld in a more rational direction. Clayton Yeutter, the U.S.Agriculture Secretary, has estimated that the nominal rate ofglobal protection on farm goods has doubled to 40% from themid-1960s. At the same time, tariffs on industrial goods havefallen to less than 6% from 40%.   Something's got to give, and the Aussie-U.S. proposalsaren't even all that radical. Beginning next year, the U.S.wants to convert all non-tariff farm barriers -- quotas,licenses and the like -- into tariffs, and then startlowering tariff rates. This is the same pattern followed forindustrial goods since World War II. Second, the U.S. wantsto phase out all export subsidies and bans -- in other words,to let farmers everywhere play by the same rules. Europe caneven keep its farmers on the dole, so long as its subsidiesstop distorting international trade.   These reforms would be especially helpful for the ThirdWorld, where agriculture remains the major employer. But theU.S. and other industrial countries also consider them aprerequisite to making progress on other trade issues.Failure, said Mr. Yeutter recently, &quot;would likely trigger anescalation of restrictive trade actions and counter-actions-- in short, an agricultural trade war nobody wants, andnobody wins.&quot;   This food fight is also something of a test case ofEuropean economic unity. As Europe becomes one market in1992, it has to decide if it's going to pick trade fightswith everyone else. If Europe wants to establish a new worldof trading &quot;blocs,&quot; protectionists elsewhere will no doubtoblige them. Then European consumers will pay most of all.</TEXT></DOC>
