Internationally,action is being taken to curb, SO{sub 2} and NO/sub X/ emissions frompower plants. In the US, a number of bills have been put before Congressto deal with both issues. The natural gas industry is promoting fuelswitching to gas as a means of reducing pollutant levels, the biggestpotential new market being in power generation, but price fluctuationsin the past may cause utilities to introduce clean coal technologiesinstead. Technologies such as cofiring of natural gas with coal or reburnof coal stack gases using natural gas are also available. There may befederal subsidies for the installation of scrubbers in coal-fired powerplants; these are seen as a threat to natural gas and clean coal technologies.Energy conservation measures could also reduce emissions. Even with conservation,however, natural gas is forecast to double its share of the world energymix in the decades ahead. 1 fig., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
