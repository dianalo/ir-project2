It was launched last Friday.    The satellite, which is undergoing performance tests, was launched from Kourou, French Guiana, by a vehicle of Arianespace S.A., the commercial satellite-launching arm of the European Space Agency. The satellite will be in a controlled drift for several days until it reaches an orbital location assigned by the Federal Communications Commission.    Associated Press, the New York-based cooperative news agency, will use the satellite to distribute its news and information services.    The GTE unit, GTE Spacenet Corp., provides communications services to broadcasters and other corporations and to the U.S. government. Its Stamford, Conn., parent has interests in telecommunications, lighting and precision materials. </TEXT></DOC>
