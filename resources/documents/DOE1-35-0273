A satellite canpass through a field-aligned &quot;Birkeland&quot; current and measure the in-situmagnetic perturbations. Satellite-borne magnetic field experiments mayalso be used to observe characteristics of resonant oscillations of theEarth's magnetic field at ULF frequencies. Examples of such measurementswith magnetic field experiments on the Viking, AMPTE/CCE, and DMSP-F7satellites will be presented. The Viking satellite, launched in February,1986, is Sweden's first satellite and is in a polar orbit with 3.1 R/sube/ apogee. AMPTE/CCE was launched in August, 1984, with satellites fromWest Germany and the United Kingdom, for the purpose of creating artificialcomets in space. It is in an equatorial orbit with a 8.8 R/sub e/ apogee.The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)-F7 satellite waslaunched in October, 1983 into an 800 km circular sun-synchronous orbitin the 0830-2030 magnetic local time plane. Viking and AMPTE/CCE observedharmonic ULF pulsations when they were near the same flux tube, but separatedby about 10 R/sub e/. These unique observations are used to investigatethe characteristics and sources of multiple field line resonances ofAlfven waves. On another occasion, Viking and DMSP-F7 observed similarmagnetic perturbations at widely separated locations. The authors interpretthese perturbations as due to a complicated system of large-scale stableBirkeland currents in the morning sector. This multi-satellite data setis in the early stages of exploration, but already confirms the usefulnessof coordinated multi-position observations of magnetic fields in space.</TEXT></DOC>
