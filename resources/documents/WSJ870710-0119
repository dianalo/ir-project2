Not because there was tear gas in the air, but because there wasn't.    &quot;They are tears of happiness,&quot; said the middle-aged shopkeeper. He was elated because more than 100,000 people had poured into one of Seoul's busiest intersections at midday to honor a university student who died from injuries suffered in a violent demonstration last month -- and because authorities weren't stopping them.    Students had marched unimpeded for nearly three miles with the casket of Lee Han Yol. The only police in sight were traffic cops. That freedom was a first for South Korea. &quot;It's simply amazing,&quot; said the shopkeeper. &quot;This proves we are now a modern nation.&quot;    The death of the student was seized upon as a symbol by almost everyone -- students, other dissidents, the opposition party and even the ruling party. And by the end of the day, his funeral tragically came to symbolize Korea's confrontational politics.    For after three hours of chanting, singing and speeches downtown, the students veered from their plan and marched off to confront the police. The once-jubilant rally ended in a melee of thick tear-gas clouds, rock throwing and chaos.    It was precisely the ending that the dead student's parents had wanted to avoid. They objected to turning their 21-year-old son's funeral into a public protest rally, but it was no longer their decision.    The students made the most of the funeral. At daybreak, chanting marchers in white mourning clothes carried Mr. Lee's coffin from a hospital morgue to the center of Yonsei University. After eulogies, they headed for downtown Seoul.    Riot police were nowhere to be seen. But thousands of people were waiting in front of Seoul's city hall, and they cheered loudly when the bier rolled into view. They cheered again when they heard opposition leaders Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam had arrived. Then they sang songs of patriotism and protest.    &quot;We did it on our own,&quot; said a happy Yonsei student who gave his name as Kim Y.D. &quot;There are no police. We have won another victory.&quot;    But after three hours in the hot sun, the chant turned from the earlier &quot;Peace&quot; to &quot;Let's march to the Blue House,&quot; President Chun Doo Hwan's residence to the north. Nearly 100,000 people set off in that direction.    Halfway up the wide Sejongono Avenue, riot police appeared from side streets and blocked the route. For about 30 minutes, there was pushing and shouting.    And then the tear gas started once again. </TEXT></DOC>
