But in his State of the Union message Tuesday night, President Bushcited the success of the Patriots in calling for the Strategic DefenseInitiative program to be &quot;refocused on providing protection from limitedballistic missile strikes -- whatever their source.&quot;;    The SDI program hashad a number of budget cuts since the Soviet nuclear threat -- which it wasintended to confront -- has waned.;    In the test, the interceptor was fired100 miles into space, where it collided with the mock warhead, destroying itby force of impact rather than an explosive charge, government officials saidTuesday.;    The interceptor is the Pentagon's main hope for destroying enemywarheads in midcourse as they speed through the vacuum of space, not as amissile first takes off or after its warheads re-enter the Earth'satmosphere.;    Although the test was a first for the star wars program, begunby President Reagan in 1983 and initially financed in the fiscal year 1985, asimilar but less advanced test was undertaken in 1984, in a program started bythe Carter administration.;    The new interceptor, known as theExoatmospheric Re-entry Vehicle Interceptor System, or Eris, after the Greekgoddess of strife, is smaller, lighter and &quot;smarter&quot; than the earlierinterceptor.;    More important, it is meant to be a working weapon ratherthan a research tool.;    The Eris interceptor, fired from Meck Island atKwajalein Atoll, flew more than 100 miles into space and collided over theSouth Pacific with the mock warhead from a Minuteman intercontinentalballistic missile launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in SouthernCalifornia.;    &quot;It was an unqualified success,&quot; said the Defense Departmentofficial, who spoke on condition of anonymity and who strongly supports theprogram.;    &quot;This,&quot; he said, &quot;is a very significant step&quot; for the Pentagon'santi-missile program.;    &quot;People are watching television. People are seeingthe devastation from hostile missiles and what the Patriot can do. This Erisdemonstration shows that we have the technology to move forward against agreater threat.&quot;;    John E. Pike, head of space policy for the Federation ofAmerican Scientists, a private group based in Washington that is generallyskeptical about the feasibility of star wars, said the Defense Department wasoverstating the test's importance, even if it proved to be as successful asdescribed.;    &quot;It took them 25 years to get Patriot to work,&quot; he said. &quot;Rightnow, this thing is where Patriot was in the 1970s.&quot;;    Pike said the testnonetheless might aid the political fortunes of the Pentagon's anti-missileprogram.;    &quot;The Patriots and the Scuds have led the star wars people tobelieve they have a new lease on life,&quot; he said. &quot;If they have a good test onEris, they won't let us forget about it.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  WILLIAM J.
