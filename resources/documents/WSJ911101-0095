It has.</LP><TEXT>   Under the weight of surging loan losses, major banks fromOslo to Helsinki are crumbling. Recession, huge write-downsof overvalued real estate portfolios and poor management haveprompted boardroom shake-ups, massive government bailouts anda collapse in confidence.   The latest shock came two weeks ago, when the Norwegiangovernment was forced to take over Christiania Bank. Massivethird-quarter losses had compounded the bank's earliertroubles, wiping out remaining shareholders' funds andleaving the bank effectively busted.   The travails add up to the region's worst banking crisissince World War II. Half a dozen major banks in threeScandinavian countries -- Norway, Sweden and Finland -- arein acute difficulty or have been seized by regulators. Theyinclude Christiania and Norway's Fokus Bank; Finland'sSkopbank and Sweden's state-controlled Nordbanken and itsbiggest savings bank, Foersta Sparbank. Even relativelyhealthy competitors are troubled by their exposure to sickbrethren. The bill to taxpayers so far is staggering -- theequivalent of roughly $6 billion.   Governments and central banks have rushed in to rescue themounting number of banks in critical condition -- fearfulthat an outright failure might shatter internationalconfidence in their financial systems. Meanwhile, thebailouts are slowing the region's recovery from recession.That, in turn, could hurt the ability of Norway, Sweden andFinland to match economic performances of competitorselsewhere in Europe, at a time when the Scandinavian nationsare pushing hard for greater economic integration with theirEuropean Community neighbors.   &quot;When you have three major commercial banks in serioustrouble, the crisis is in some ways more serious than the{U.S.} Sandamp;Ls,&quot; says Simon Adamson, analyst at London's IBCAbank-credit rating agency.   Norway is hardest hit. Private and state-financedbank-guarantee funds have pumped in nearly 20 billionNorwegian kroner (about $3 billion) to keep ailing financialinstitutions afloat. The latest round of state intervention-- including the bailout of Christiania Bank -- will leavevirtually the entire banking industry under state control.And even No. 1 Den norske Bank and a few remainingindependent savings banks are lining up for state handouts.   Yesterday, Den norske Bank reported that for the firstnine months of 1991 its loss widened to 2.33 billion kronerfrom 559 million kroner a year earlier, because of soaringreservations for credit losses and write-downs on properties.The bank also said that to meet tougher capital requirementsthat start next year, it was granted 1.25 billion kroner inpreference capital from the Commercial Banks' Guarantee Fund.Following the cash injection, the bank said it will postponeuntil next year its planned 2 billion-kroner share issue.   Christiana Bank also came out with earnings this week. Thegloomy figures generally confirmed the bank's preliminaryprojections made public two weeks ago. Christiania Bankacknowledged &quot;that {its} equity and preference capital mustbe considered lost&quot; as a result of the third-quarter net lossof 5.7 billion kroner. For the nine months, the bank posted anet loss of 7.33 billion kroner.   Neighboring Sweden and Finland have coughed up theequivalent of billions of dollars to shore up shaky banks.Finland's central bank has invested 11 billion Finnishmarkkaa (about $2.66 billion) in its bailout of ailingSkopbank.   Sweden's 71% state-controlled Nordbanken tapped statecoffers for 5.2 billion Swedish kronor (about $840 million)this autumn when record loan-loss provisions plunged it belowminimum capital-adequacy standards. Sweden's new center-rightgovernment had been eager to privatize the bank, but thelatest losses scared off prospective private investors.   Underscoring the industrywide turmoil, virtually everymajor bank in Norway, Sweden and Finland has installed a newchief executive during the past 18 months.   Most of the blame for the losses can be pinned to therapid deregulation of local marketplaces in recent years.Previously, says Finnish bank regulator Jorma Aranko, &quot;therewas very strict credit rationing and banks could pick andchoose who to give money to.&quot; Loan losses were a tinyfraction of credit outstanding.   But deregulation, says a London-based U.S. investmentbanker, &quot;turned a lot of wild people loose on theScandinavian markets.&quot; As competition opened up, banks havescrambled for business, resulting in price cutting and aneasing of standards for credit risk.   Abolition of tight lending quotas set off a credit boom.Banks' lending soared at annual rates of more than 30% in allof the Scandinavian countries.   During the past 12 months, loan losses and provisions havepiled up almost as fast. &quot;Obviously, bankers underestimatedthe inherent risks in expanding so rapidly,&quot; says FinnHvistendahl, a former chemical engineer now installed aschief executive officer of Norway's Den norske Bank. &quot;If theeconomy works against you, you've got problems.&quot;   Such a downturn hit Norway in 1986, sparked by plungingworld oil prices. Five subsequent years of recession aterelentlessly into banks' reserves, and then decimated corecapital and pushed the entire financial system to thebreaking point.   Sweden, Scandinavia's biggest and most diversifiedeconomy, is in the second year of what economists describe asthe most severe recession since World War II.   Anders Sahlen, director general of Finansinspektionen,Sweden's main banking regulator, estimates that banks' loanlosses and provisions this year will more than double to 25billion Swedish kronor.   Finland is in even worse straits. Economists predictFinland's gross national product will plummet more than 5%this year and probably decline again next year. Major banksare well capitalized, but a long recession could havedevastating effects, banking analysts warn.   The sole exception to the Nordic gloom seems to beDenmark, the only Scandinavian member of the EuropeanCommunity. As an EC member, Denmark deregulated its financialmarkets -- and began taming chronically high inflationthrough disciplined economic policy -- years ahead of itsneighbors farther north.</TEXT></DOC>
