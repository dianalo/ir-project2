DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush said today he will sendCongress ``in the next few days'' his recommendations for payraises for top federal officials, members of Congress and judges.   Bush made the commitment as the private National Commission onPublic Service suggested pay raises for federal officials virtuallyas high as the increases that Congress killed in February.   Neither Bush nor White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwaterindicated what Bush's recommendation would be.   ``This is very timely,'' the president told members of thecommission, which is headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman PaulVolcker. ``In the next few days, I'll be making some very specificproposals.''   Fitzwater reiterated to reporters Bush's view that there shouldbe pay raises for federal executives, judges and members ofCongress, although he said no decisions had been made aboutrecommendations to Capitol Hill.   Fitzwater said that in the meeting, Bush had pointed out that``it was important for the president to speak out and to set a toneand prevent a morale problem in the civil service.'' But thespokesman also said ``I'm not aware of a morale problem.''   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, however, said he considered itunlikely that members of Congress would be willing to consideranother pay raise this year.   ``Will something get done this year? I doubt it,'' said Coelho,D-Calif., in a telephone interview. ``Something needs to be donebut I'm not at all optimistic.''   The private study panel headed by Volcker today recommended payincreases of approximately 50 percent over two years for thesefederal officials.   The pay increases suggested by Volcker's commission roughlyparallel those called for by a congressionally created panel andendorsed by Bush as well as his predecessor, Ronald Reagan.   Those increases were rejected by Congress in the face of intensepublic criticism centering on the proposed pay raise for thelawmakers.   The private commission also recommended that Congress prohibitits members from receiving speaking honoraria and other outsideincome related to their public responsibilities, saying thatotherwise the increase would be more likely to be ``perceived bythe American people as excessive.''   ``Not only does such income create lingering doubts about theneed for an across-the-board increase, but it also underminespublic trust in national institutions,'' the panel said.   The commission, which includes former President Gerald R. Fordand former Vice President Walter F. Mondale among its 36 members,also suggested pay increases for lower-ranking government workers.   It recommended that these raises be phased in and the cost ofthem absorbed through reductions in employment or the eliminationof government programs. The commission recommended that pay forcivil service workers be varied depending on the cost of living indifferent parts of the country.   Volcker said that based on talks with some members of Congress,``I do find some renewal of interest in the subject'' of payincreases.   Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., a member of the commission, said hedetected on Capitol Hill ``a feeling that something needs to bedone in all areas.''   But he said some lawmakers strongly oppose the commission'srecommendation that speaking honoraria for lawmakers be outlawedand that their salaries perhaps be considered separately from thoseof judges and executive branch officials.   ``Don't underestimate a few committed souls,'' Robb said.   Douglas Fraser, former president of the United AutomobileWorkers and a member of the commission, said that organized laborgenerally supports the commission's report, but disagrees with theproposal that pay vary from locality to locality. ``It creates inmany cases gross inequalities,'' Fraser said.   George King, director of public relations for the NationalTreasury Employees Union, said the commission's report ``reallydoesn't address the lower-grade or rank-and-file federalemployees.''   ``It holds out the false hope that pay increases for thesepeople can be absorbed in current agency budgets or throughreductions in force,'' King said.   He said that his organization, which claims to represent 144,000federal workers, seeks annual pay raises of 6 percent, or 3 percentabove inflation, whichever is larger, and advocatesagency-by-agency bargaining.   The commission was formed after a conference held in Washingtonin 1987 by the liberal Brookings Institution and the conservativeAmerican Enterprise Institute.   It reported that the purchasing power of executive, judicial andlegislative salaries has fallen by 35 percent since 1969 andrecommnded that they be restored to the 1969 purchasing powerlevel. This would require an increase of about 50 percent.   The commission recommended that 25 percent of the increase begranted now and the rest by the beginning of the new Congress in1991. If Congress is unable to act on its own salaries, even thoughthey are phased in and accompanied by a ban on speaking fees, thecommission recommended that the president submit separate payraises for judges and senior executives.   If increases for senior political employees are delayed, thepresident and Congress should raise a current limit on top-levelcareer employees even if this means that they make more than thepolitical appointees who are above them, the commission said.</TEXT></DOC>
