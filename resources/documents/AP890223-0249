The Fed, which regulates bank holding companies, including thenation's largest banking firms, said Wednesday that lending inleveraged buyouts, or LBOs, ``is not considered inappropriate solong as it is conducted in a sound and prudent manner.''   However, it cautioned that banking organizations' involvement inLBOs, which have mushroomed over the last year, could have``significant implications for the quality of their asset portfoliosand their overall levels of risk exposure.''   In an LBO, an investment group borrows heavily in order to takeover a company or a division of a company. Often LBOs are proposedby managers seeking to thwart a hostile takeover. The company's newowners either cut costs or sell off pieces of the company to payback loans.   The danger, according to the Federal Reserve memorandum, is thatthe high debt levels ``can place heavy demands on a borrower's cashflow and reduce the borrower's ability to absorb the effects ofunanticipated financial shocks or economic adversity.''   The board said examiners should review a bank's overall exposureto risk by involvement in LBO lending as well as the soundness ofindividual LBO loans.   ``Any significant portfolio risks need to be identified andbrought to the attention of senior management and the directors,''it said.   The Fed also warned that banks which participate by lending moneyin LBOs arranged by other firms should independently evaluate thedeals before advancing any money.   The board's memorandum to examiners, released Wednesday, wasdated Feb. 16. It supersedes LBO guidelines issued in June 1984. Thenew instructions also apply to other so-called highly leveragedtransactions, including stock buybacks financed by high levels ofdebt.   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an arm of theTreasury Department that regulates nationally-chartered banks,issued similar instructions to its regulators in December.   Meanwhile, a half dozen congressional committees are examiningways to curb the buyout boom, but have been unable to agree on anapproach that wouldn't cut tax revenues or have other unintended illeffects.</TEXT></DOC>
