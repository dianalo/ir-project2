The downsizing is part of Eastern's plan for reorganization inthe wake of the strike that idled the Miami-based carrier forseveral months early this year.   Eastern President Phil Bakes said the pay and benefit reductionswere ``something we wanted to avoid,'' but large losses areexpected to continue in the first half of the new year.   The belt-tightening package is expected to save $100 millionnext year for Eastern, which posted a net loss of $185.2 million inthis year's third quarter.   The announcement reflects Eastern's intention to return to itsoriginal reorganization plan cutting its pre-strike operations by athird. In August, dogged by failure to sell the profitable LatinAmerican routes, Eastern had decided to pare operations by only 10percent.   Attrition and early retirement will blunt the effects of thecutbacks, but a number of operational employees will be out of workJan. 31 as Miami operations are reduced from 75 daily flights to 50.   Job cuts also will come July 1 when rival American Airlinesplans to take over the Latin American routes, Eastern Senior VicePresident Tom Matthews told a news conference in Miami.   After months of negotiations, American said Dec. 19 it would buyEastern's Latin American routes and certain other assets fromEastern's parent Texas Air Corp. for $471 million.   Federal officials and the U.S. bankruptcy judge overseeingEastern's Chapter 11 reorganization must approve the deal.   Separately Thursday, Pan Am Corp. said it intends to protest tothe government American's planned purchase of the Latin Americanroutes. Pan Am contends that the route transfer from ailing Easternto the nation's largest airline will hinder competition.   Eastern said pilots, flight attendants and Machinists will notbe affected by the job cuts. The airline has hired thousands ofemployees in those categories, mostly non-union, to replace membersof the striking unions.   But half of Eastern's 20,000 employees _ including management,pilots and flight attendants working at the higher pre-strike wagelevels _ will have their wages reduced by 10 percent to 20 percentfor a year, beginning Jan. 16.   About 850 pilots will see their $72,000-a-year salaries slashedby 20 percent for six months. Half of the cut will be restoredafter six months, and pay will return to normal after a year. About950 newly hired pilots are working for $27,500 a year and will notbe affected.   Flight attendants earning a pre-strike salary of $30,000 a yearalso will take cuts, but those hired under the new wage levels of$15,000 will not.   The wage cuts are subject to union negotiations, Matthews said.Officials of the Air Line Pilots Association were not immediatelyavailable for comment on Eastern's action. Mary Jane Barry, head ofthe Eastern flight attendants union, said she couldn't commentsince contract negotiations are ongoing.   The pilots and flight attendants unions, which walked out insympathy with the Machinists' strike, called off their actions justbefore Thanksgiving but few got their jobs back.   Matthews said he expects the latest round of cuts to be the lastnecessary to achieve the reorganization plan.   Eastern employed about 32,000 before the strike began March 4.The airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection fromcreditors five days later.   Eastern plans to reshape itself at about two-thirds of itspre-strike size with its major hub in Atlanta. Matthews deniedspeculation that Eastern plans eventually to move its headquartersfrom Miami to that city.   Rising fuel prices and the prospect of only modest growth in airtravel in 1990 also were factors in the decision to cut jobs, theairline said.   Also Thursday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland extendeduntil Feb. 12 Friday's deadline for Eastern to submit its revisedreorganization plan. The judge already has given the airlineseveral such extensions.</TEXT></DOC>
