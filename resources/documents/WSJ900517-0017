The most-active July delivery ended with a gain of 0.30cent a pound at $1.1440, after trading as much as one cent apound lower at $1.1310.</LP><TEXT>   Late yesterday, well after the close of trading, theworld's leading copper producer -- Chile's state-owned coppercompany, Codelco -- further reduced its production forecastfor this year to 1.19 million tons of refined copper. Thisprojection is down from its original estimate of 1.29 milliontons at the end of 1989. Since then, there have been severalcuts in Codelco's estimated output for this year. The companysaid numerous production problems have reduced output andincreased costs.   For most of the session yesterday, futures pricescontinued under the recent pressure generated by animprovement of copper supplies and an apparent slowdown inthe U.S. economy, which may result in slower copperconsumption.   Although the soon-to-expire May delivery, which closed at$1.2170 for a gain of 0.40 cent, showed an 0.10 centimprovement in its premium over July, the premium of the cashprice over the three-months' contract in London continued tonarrow.   &quot;The severe tightness of supplies has apparently beenbroken, and the only thing that kept prices from slidingsignificantly was the report that a miners' strike would takeplace Monday in Peru,&quot; said one analyst.   The New York spokesman for Southern Peru Copper Corp. saidthe unions representing workers at the company's Toquepalaand Cuajone mines, and its Ilo smelter, had given notice theywill strike on Monday.   The employees at Southern Peru Copper's threeinstallations on March 12 went on a strike that lasted eightweeks. They returned to work late last week without anagreement in response to a government order. Negotiationsbetween the unions and management have continued since then.   The company's Ilo smelter, which receives concentratesfrom other mines as well as its own two, has an annualproduction of about 280,000 tons of refined copper.   Separately, the Peruvian state-owned mining company,Centromin, is also on strike. The company principally mineszinc, lead and silver, but it produces about 35,000 tons ofcopper.   Economic statistics continue to present aless-than-promising picture for copper. The CommerceDepartment said housing starts in April fell 5.8%, followinga drop of 11.2% in March. Permits for housing starts, alonger-term indicator, were off 8.7% in April following a 5%decline in March.   This was the third consecutive monthly drop in thesestatistics, which, according to one analyst, &quot;represents asolid trend.&quot; Combined with other recent statistics thatindicate a slowing of economic growth, they are a negativefactor for copper, he said.   Another analyst, Fred Demler, metals economist forPaineWebber, New York, noted that there are actually mixedsignals about the economy, and that could be eventuallyfavorable for copper.   &quot;While the economy may be slowing, interest rates havebeen dropping and the stock market is strong,&quot; he said. &quot;Thisindicates that down the road the economy will improve.&quot;   An important factor that soon could make its presencefelt, Mr. Demler said, was that three U.S. copper-producingcompanies, which have a combined production capacity of420,000 tons of refined copper, will have their laboragreements with unions end on June 30.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: The American Petroleum Institute's bullishstatistics this week on U.S. gasoline inventories didn'tcounter the API's extremely bearish figures on crude oilstocks in energy futures trading yesterday. The result: a56-cents-a-barrel plunge in the price of the New YorkMercantile Exchange's June crude oil contract. The APInumbers, released late Tuesday after trading had ended,showed a huge 4.2-million-barrel decline in gasolineinventories for the week ended last Friday. But crude oilinventories rose by more than 4.3 million barrels. Sometraders had expressed hopes that the gasoline number wouldprove more bullish than the crude figure was bearish, butthose hopes didn't pan out. The June crude oil contract endedthe session at $19.03 a barrel, just above thepsychologically important $19 level. June gasoline, whichstarted the trading day higher and then sagged with crude,rebounded at the end of the day to finish 0.66 cents higher.                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Pork belly futures closed up thetwo-cent-a-pound daily limit in response to a weekly reportindicating a tightening of supplies, contrary to analysts'expectations. The report showed a net flow of 199,000 poundsof pork bellies out of warehouses to processors. Manyanalysts had estimated net movement into warehouses, inadvance of an expected seasonal peak in demand this summer,of as much as one million to 1.5 million pounds, said JerryAbbenhaus, an analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons in St. Louis.The warehouse report augurs well for higher belly futuresprices in the weeks ahead, said Charles Levitt, a futuresanalyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in Chicago. One reasonfor the decline of pork belly movement into warehouses isthat many pork bellies are apparently being ground up intotrimmings to be used for hot dogs and sausage, where retaildemand is higher currently than it is for bacon, Mr. Levittsaid. The belly futures market was also poised for a reboundfollowing a week of declining prices, analysts said. Porkbellies for July delivery closed up two cents, at 64.37 centsa pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The rally in porkbelly futures prices spilled over into the live hog pit atthe Merc, where July live hog futures closed up 1.5 cents at63.67 cents a pound.                                                                                                          COCOA: Futures prices rose on continued turmoil in theIvory Coast, the world's leading cocoa producer. The Julycontract ended with a gain of $35 a metric ton to $1,433,after trading as high as $1,485. Signs of division among thearmed forces of the Ivory Coast resulted in renewed tensionthat sparked the price surge in futures, said Sandra Kaul,analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton. Apparently, army recruitsprotesting low pay and poor living conditions commandeeredboth military and civilian vehicles and rioted in thestreets, she said. Regular troops were stationed to guardcommunication centers, she noted, and added that the airport,which early yesterday was held by the recruits, later wastaken over by military police. A French military forcestationed outside Abidjan, the nation's capital, was put onmaximum alert, she said. Another analyst, Judith Ganes, ofMerrill Lynch, observed that, so far, the disturbanceshaven't affected the production or shipments of cocoa.&quot;However, there is the concern that if they last long enoughand spread, they will have an impact on the cocoa market,&quot;she said.</TEXT></DOC>
