These are gigantic malls, three or four times the size of typical suburban malls, that combine shopping with theme-park entertainment. The complexes will be anchored by &quot;hypermarkets&quot; -- warehouse-size combination supermarkets and discount stores geared to repeat high-volume business. The malls will feature department stores and other shops in an amusement-park setting with such diversions as Ferris wheels, skating rinks, miniature golf courses and water rides on indoor lakes stocked with fish.    Some people scoff at such plans, pointing to an existing shopping-mall glut. &quot;I just don't understand a formula that is half tourism and half shopping,&quot; says Allan Pennington, of Pennington Associates, a New York retail consultant. &quot;Besides, we're already over-stored in this country.&quot;    But others disagree, saying the retail concepts Mr. Herscu espouses could redefine U.S. malls, which some say are now virtually indistinguishable from each other.    &quot;He'll either be the new hero in the mall business, or the idea will be a total bust,&quot; says Gilbert Harrison, a managing director of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., who is advising Mr. Herscu and Australia-based Hooker Corp. on the projects. Mr. Herscu is chairman, chief executive officer and controlling stockholder of Hooker, Australia's largest land developer.    Mr. Herscu, 59 years old, tends to sprinkle his conversation with words like &quot;big,&quot; &quot;bigger&quot; and &quot;biggest.&quot; Of his mall plans, he says, &quot;Someone has got to be a pioneer. American malls are 20 to 30 years old now. They're boring. Americans need something new.&quot;    Hooker has broken ground on two of the malls, in Denver and Cincinnati, and is about to begin construction on others in Columbia, S.C., and Tampa, Fla. There also are plans for a 16-acre mall in Atlanta. Earlier this month, Hooker agreed to buy Allied Stores Corp.'s Bonwit Teller chain for $101 million, with plans to expand the number of Bonwit stores to 28 from 13 and use some as mall anchors.    In his Manhattan office, Mr. Herscu tosses a blueprint for the Cincinnati mall onto a table with a flourish with one hand as color brochures spill from the other hand. &quot;They're giants, just colossal!&quot; he says, pointing to the &quot;hypermarket&quot; store that will anchor one end of the complex.    Exuberance comes naturally to Mr. Herscu, who built a mansion in Australia modeled after Tara in &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; a book he says he's read more than 10 times. Mr. Herscu emigrated to Australia at the end of World War II as a destitute Romanian who had spent three years in a Nazi labor camp. Before long, he owned a milk bar in Melbourne.    In Australia, where such self-made men are fiercely admired, his rags-to-riches story is well-known. But the Herscu story has some less-glamorous details, including a guilty plea in 1983 to a charge that an Australian company he ran offered bribes of building materials to a trade union official in exchange for favorable treatment.    That matter resurfaced last summer in Sydney, when Mr. Herscu was part of a venture seeking to build the world's largest gambling casino. The bid ultimately was rejected by the government. In a report on Mr. Herscu's background, the Police Board of New South Wales alluded to the union affair and said, &quot;The conclusion is open that Mr. Herscu, when under pressure, was prepared to bribe people when he considered it was necessary for his company's advantage. In the circumstances, it is the board's view that such a person cannot be considered to be of good reputation, probity and integrity . . . .&quot;    The police board report also mentioned &quot;matters of public knowledge&quot; regarding his alleged association with companies that avoid taxes in so-called &quot;bottom of the harbor&quot; schemes, in which certain documentation is destroyed -- figuratively sent to the &quot;bottom of the harbor.&quot; Mr. Herscu says he relied on financial experts for tax advice and didn't know details.    Of the union bribe charge, Mr. Herscu says, &quot;It was an unfortunate episode. I never had a criminal involvement, and then this appeared.&quot; He won't discuss the casino project except to allow, &quot;This is life.&quot; He is suing New South Wales for breach of contract and the premier for defamation.    Mr. Herscu isn't well-known in the U.S., though more than half of Hooker's operations are now based here. The company has been expanding rapidly into such areas as commercial real estate (it bought Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s commercial real estate business in December), home building and retail stores such as Merksamer Jewelers, a 60-year-old San Francisco-based jewelry chain purchased last June.    In Australia, Mr. Herscu has done well for Hooker's public shareholders. The company's after-tax operating profit rose 56% in 1986. When he took control of more than 40% of Hooker in a 1985 hostile takeover, its shares were selling for $1.85 (Australian) each. The price since has risen to about $3.25.    Mr. Herscu also is chairman of closely held Hersfield Developments Ltd., a developer and manager of shopping malls.    &quot;Herscu was astute in that he was able to find the sites and get the major tenants,&quot; says Barry Glover, who was managing director of Hooker before Mr. Herscu's takeover. &quot;The key element is clearly that he's highly entrepreneurial.&quot;    Shrewd and tough at times, Mr. Herscu is also a chatty storyteller who brags about his three children (who work with him), his charity work and his friends in high places. In Australia, he boasts, &quot;I know some of the biggest, most powerful people in the country.&quot;    Mr. Herscu claims his secret to success is hard work -- 12 to 14 hours a day, seven days a week -- and an innate entrepreneurial instinct. &quot;Either you have it or you haven't,&quot; asserts the rotund, ruddy-faced developer. &quot;I do.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
