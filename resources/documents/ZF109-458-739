says MacKenzie.andO;&quot;It's recognized as a productivity tool essential to helping the departmentmeet its goals and objectives.andP;  We're highly automated and well networked.&quot;andM;The department has approximately 12,000 employees across Canada with nearly4,500 computing devices tied together through a private X.25 packet network.andM;Computing strategyandM;The department's computing strategy is to use IBM technology for large-scaletime-critical applications such as corporate finance and databases, andagricultural relief programs.andM;The department also uses Vax technology from Digital for its scientific,inspection and office automation needs, plus general computing.andM;The department, however, did not want two separate systems and twotechnologies were merged.andP;  This gave rise to what MacKenzie calls &quot;someinteresting challenges&quot; to STM Systems Corp. of Toronto, which runs the IBMequipment and large systems under a facilities management contract.andM;Facilities management is a dedicated processing environment in whichequipment, software, operations, support and host communications are providedand managed on an ongoing basis.andM;One of the challenges faced by STM was in the area of IBM communicationconnectivity and trouble-shooting.andM;IBM, Digital linksandM;&quot;With the variety of IBM, Digital and other components involved,troubled-shooting requires extensive investigation, all under the pressure oftime imposed by users anxious to get through to the mainframe,&quot; saysMacKenzie.andM;Agriculture Canada has 47 Vax minicomputers across Canada, accessed by avariety of devices from word processors and personal computers to terminalssuch as IBM 3270s.andM;Vax technology was chosen originally because of its net working capabilityand because its scientific applications met the needs of the department'sthousands of scientists, from biologists and entomologists to botanists andagronomists.andM;&quot;Most people on the network come in through the Vax systems,&quot; explainsMacKenzie.andP;  &quot;When they want to access the IBM systems they go throughDigital's Systems Network Architecture (SNA) gateways.andP;  From the user level,they usually go through the regional vax centures and then to the IBM system,and back the same way.andP;  It works well, albeit not without problems.andP;  Ourobjective was that no matter what device was involved, users shouldeffectively be able to send a document to anyone else on the network, andthat during the move backwards and forwards there should be no problemencountered by the user,&quot; she adds.andP;  &quot;Most people using differenttechnologies keep them separate, but we wanted one system, not two.andP;  STMresponded to the challenge.andM;&quot;In fact, we've had excellent support from STM in many ways.andP;  Their peoplehave worked closely with us to meet a lot of our challenges.&quot;andP;  AgricultureCanada has 200 applicauons based on Vax technology and 30 systems based onIBM technology.andP;  IBM systems include financial administrative and personnelsystems and various agricultural subsidization plans.andM;Also on the IBM mainframe are systems in support of the department'sconsiderable work in genetic modelling.andM;Genetic modelling evaluates the merit of all dairy cattle, beef cattle andswine in Canada, providing livestock producers with essential informationwhen selecting breeding stock.andM;The production records and pedigree information of all breeding animals inCanada are kept in genetic data banks and, because genetic modelling tracesthe flow of genes as far back as possible, all records from the early 1900sto the present are used in each new evaluation.andM;&quot;Genetic modelling plays an important role in development of the dairyindustry,&quot; notes MacKenzie.andP;  &quot;For instance, it helps provide the industrywith more efficient dairy cows, for instance, cows that can produce more milkfrom the same amount of feed or the same amount of milk with less feed.andP;  Suchcows are in high demand all over the world and Canada exports them to morethan 50 countries.&quot;andM;She adds: &quot;The systems needed for genetic modelling are huge and arecontinuing to increase in size.andP;  The power of the large IBM mainframe becomesvery useful in processing these large numerical models in a timely manner.&quot;andM;The department has 31 research stations across Canada and 20 experimentalfarms and sub-stations.andM;Another part of the department's mandate requiring large computer systems isa huge food inspection program requiring every shipment of food enteringCanada to be inspected at border crossing points.andM;This includes meat, dairy, fruit and vegetables -- every agricultural productwith the exception of fish, which is inspected by Fisheries and OceansCanada.andP;  The inspection program is to protect against such things as diseaseand infestations.andM;Inspections are carried out at more than 100 border crossings and ports ofentry where inspectors enter data on some $6.8 billion worth of agriculturalimports (1987 figures).andP;  Also monitored are shipments between provinces offresh fruit and vegetables.andM;In addition to large, ongoing programs, Agriculture Canada must respondquickly to government initiatives such as the Canadian Crop DroughtAssistance Program for farmers hard hit by the 1988 drought.andM;&quot;Initiatives such as the drought assistance program are time-sensitive andmust often be delivered much more quickly than normal development cyclesallow,&quot; says MacKenzie.andP;  &quot;Fortunately, the Agriculture Canada and STM teamswork closely to plan and co-ordinate requirements.andP;  Performance tuning andcapacity planning are ongoing concerns.andP;  Capacity planning is particularlyimportant but we're well positioned to forecast future growth and areconfident we will continue to meet user needs.&quot;andM;Maurice Simms is senior writer, corporate communications department, STMSystems Corp., in Toronto.andP;  STMprovides information management and systemsintegration services to public and private sector clients.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
