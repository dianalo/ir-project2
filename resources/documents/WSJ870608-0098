Partners at big accounting firms that audit banks are reluctant to discuss such reserves for specific clients. But they admit that the recent move by Citicorp, followed by four others, to boost such reserves is a big incentive for them to get tougher with their other bank clients.    Accounting firms are in somewhat of a no-win situation. One problem is that auditors are hobbled by a lack of specific professional rules for treating such reserves. They can insist that the banks either take more adequate reserves or face a qualified opinion of financial statements, at the risk of friction with bank management and loss of lucrative business. Or they can accept the banks' more favorable valuation of the loans, and risk lawsuits by shareholders for failing to adequately represent the financial condition of the banks in their audits.    John Shank, professor of accounting at Dartmouth College, Hanover, N.H., says the measurement of loan-loss reserves is a &quot;black hole&quot; in both accounting and auditing literature. &quot;Because it is so wishy-washy, when a crisis arises such as Brazil or Mexico failing to pay back or stopping interest payments, the auditors just don't know what to do.&quot;    Nonetheless, because of the decisions of the five banks to create these reserves, the auditors are expected to plow ahead and recognize &quot;the urgencies in the international debt market that make such reserves more of a reality,&quot; one auditor says.    &quot;We'll likely see more increases in reserves against loans to less-developed countries in this quarter,&quot; says William J. Dolan Jr., managing partner who is in charge of bank clients of Chicago-based Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., a major accounting firm.    &quot;We're going to have to consider the recent action of the major players in banking as new input to our auditing decisions,&quot; says Mr. Dolan, who also is chairman of the banking committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.    Some accountants question how outside auditors have so far permitted some banks to initiate whopping reserve increases while not forcing other client banks with similar loan exposure to boost reserves.    &quot;There isn't anything in the good book of GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) that spells out exactly what loan-loss reserves should be,&quot; says Loyd Heath, a professor of accounting at the University of Washington in Seattle. &quot;The banks seem to have the upper hand in setting these reserves and the differences in their policies have the auditors' heads spinning.&quot;    Citicorp, for example, which has $11.7 billion in Latin American loans, has boosted its reserves by $3 billion, citing suspended interest payments by Brazil and Ecuador and sharply limited payments of principal and interest by Peru. Citicorp says its current financial strength allowed it to more realistically value its Third World debt, particularly in Latin America.    In the wake of Citicorp's action, Chase Manhattan Corp., Security Pacific Corp., Norwest Corp. and Bank of Boston Corp. followed suit. But Manufacturers Hanover Corp., with $7.6 billion in such loans, hasn't taken similar action. Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover are clients of Peat Marwick, the biggest world-wide accounting firm.    Asked whether Manufacturers will create such a reserve, a company spokesman said &quot;it is a matter for the board of directors and will be reviewed by the board at its regular monthly meeting on June 16.&quot; He declined further comment.    Thomas F. Keaveney, Peat Marwick's national director of banking, says Citicorp and Manufacturers may decide differently on foreign loan-loss reserves, since the decision is a &quot;judgment call by management.&quot; He adds: &quot;Within broad parameters, auditors can and do challenge bank managements' estimates of loan-loss reserves. But the judgment must first be made by management and then reviewed for reasonableness by the auditor.&quot;    Even a recent study issued by the accountants institute, called &quot;Auditing the Allowances for Credit Losses of Banks,&quot; doesn't give any specific advice on how to reserve for troubled foreign loans; it simply advises the auditor to consult an outside specialist who knows a debtor country's economic, political and social climate. An institute official says the study is aimed at small accounting firms rather than the bigger firms, &quot;which have developed their own guidance for such loans.&quot;    Douglas R. Carmichael, an accounting professor at the City University of New York's Baruch College, says that &quot;how tough a stand auditors are willing to take (on loan-loss reserves) remains to be seen.&quot; He concedes that &quot;it looks funny to the public that some banks recognize losses on foreign debt while others don't, while the auditors stand idly by.&quot;    Banks currently are allowed to include loan-loss reserves in their primary capital, which regulators require them to keep at a certain minimum ratio to assets. But Mr. Carmichael notes that if regulators change their minds about including such reserves in capital, it &quot;could put outside auditors in a double squeeze&quot; over the financial condition of their bank clients. Major banks would then be forced to raise more money to meet capital requirements, even as boosts in loan-loss reserves are eating into profits.    In a proposal made last February by the Federal Reserve Bank, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the question was raised about including loan-loss reserves in primary capital. Five years ago regulators boosted the primary capital requirement to 5 1/2% of bank assets from 5%. Up to now, primary capital has included stockholders' equity, certain permanent debt and preferred issues and the allowance for loan losses, which the regulators would prefer to keep. But a Fed official concedes that if sentiment grows for excluding loan-loss reserves, as is done in other nations, &quot;we'd have to take a serious look at the move.&quot;    James J. McDermott Jr., a senior analyst at Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., a securities firm that specializes in bank stocks, points out that eliminating the reserves would consume major portions of the primary capital of many major banks with foreign loan exposure and limit their ability to make more loans. For example, it would reduce the primary capital of BankAmerica by about 30%, Manufacturers Hanover by about 19%, Mellon Bank by about 20% and Irving Trust by 14%.    &quot;Increasing loan-loss reserves at BankAmerica, together with the effect of this proposal, could eat into the core business of the bank's branches and its Seafirst bank unit in Seattle,&quot; says Mr. McDermott.    A.W. Clausen, BankAmerica's chairman, at a recent news conference after the company's annual meeting in San Francisco, indicated that despite mounting pressure, he won't boost reserves against troubled foreign sovereign debt by anything close to the steps taken by Citicorp and Chase.    A spokesman for Cleveland-based Ernst andamp; Whinney, the auditor for BankAmerica, declines comment on any action planned for BankAmerica or the subject of loan losses for foreign debt in general. &quot;It's too complicated a subject so we'd rather not discuss it,&quot; he says.    Some auditors maintain that the reason banks' judgments are so diverse on foreign-loan reserves is that nations, unlike companies, don't issue financial reports. An accounting rule issued in 1975 &quot;tells us that if the loan loss is known and can be estimated, we would require our client banks to accrue an allowance or reserve for it,&quot; says Kenneth F. Cooper, national director of banking for Touche Ross andamp; Co., a major accounting firm. Touche Ross has 300 banking clients, but none with big Latin American debt exposure.    &quot;But it's difficult for us to separate nationalistic rhetoric from reality when countries in debt speak with so many voices,&quot; says Mr. Cooper, who is a member of the CPA institute's banking committee. Since banks set up a reserve for a &quot;market basket of debt&quot; rather than for specific loans, it's difficult to compare loan exposure from one bank to another, partners at other accounting firms say.    &quot;It will be difficult, if not impossible, to get comparability for these reserves among accounting firms and even among each firm's clients,&quot; says Mr. Carmichael. Accounting firms don't audit quarterly financial statements, but &quot;judgment day&quot; may come when 1987 annual reports of the banks are issued, he says.    &quot;If auditors don't qualify their opinions, rather than give a clean bill of health to banks with big troubled foreign-loan exposure that refuse to set up reserves, then there'll be big reasons for the public to question whether auditors are properly doing their job,&quot; says Mr. Carmichael.    ---              BANKS WITH LARGEST LATIN AMERICAN              LOAN EXPOSURE AND THEIR AUDITORS                  (In billions of dollars)                                  Reserve increase                                  required to cover                     Latin Amer-  25% of Latin loans                     ican loan    and 100% of non- Bank                exposure     performing loans   Auditor Citicorp             $11.7            $0.00*        Peat                                                     Marwick Manufacturers          7.6             2.76         Peat Hanover Corp.
