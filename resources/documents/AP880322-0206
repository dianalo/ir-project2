KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Early Senate ratification of the agreementbanning medium-range nuclear weapons worldwide hit a potentiallymajor roadblock Tuesday with the reopening of a long-festeringconstitutional feud between Congress and the White House over theinterpretation of treaties.   Several members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committeeexpressed dismay at the development. They said it could delayratification of the new Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INFTreaty until after the planned summit meeting later this springbetween President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   On another front, however, the Senate Intelligence Committeereported unanimously that Soviet compliance with the new treaty canbe monitored with ``great certainty.''   But the panel made clear that detecting Soviet efforts to cheaton a future pact making sharp cuts in long-range strategic armswould strain U.S. intelligence capabilites.   The treaty interpretation controversy was raised in testimonybefore the Foreign Relations panel by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.   Nunn said a recent letter from White House Counsel Arthur B.Culvahouse Jr. effectively undercut previous assurances fromSecretary of State George P. Shultz that administration testimonyon the new pact is ``authoritative.''   The dispute stems from the Reagan administration's unilateralre-interpretation last year of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic MissileTreaty with the Soviet Union in order to permit the deployment of a``Star Wars'' missile defense system.   The new Culvahouse letter undercuts the Shultz assurance, Nunntold the committee, by asserting that some administration responsesmay be less authoritative than others.   Culvahouse suggested that the testimony of a secretary of statemay be more authoritative than that of other administrationwitnesses or responses in writing to questions by members ofCongress, Nunn said.   Culvahouse has since issued a second letter asserting that hisoriginal remarks were not inconsistent with the Shultz statement.But Nunn said he finds that unacceptable.   ``It doesn't solve my problem,'' Nunn said. ``It simply assertsthere is no conflict. You can assert anything ... It puts theShultz statement in the trash can, saying that certain testimony isnot to be taken seriously.''   He said the Culvahouse assertion casts doubt on the authority ofseveral administration interpretations on a list of ambiguities intreaty language. That might have to be resolved point by point in atime consuming process on the Senate floor, he said.   Nunn said he believes the controversy must be resolved by thefull Senate and that another letter, even one from the president,would not be acceptable.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said, ``This is the majorstumbling block and could create grave perils if we don't resolveit.'' He predicted that the issue could result in a seriouspartisan split inside the committee and in the Senate.   ``It would be tragic if this treaty was destroyed because we hada procedural dispute with the president,'' said Sen. Brock Adams,D-Wash.   The Intelligence Committee report was presented to the SenateForeign Relations Committee as that panel prepared to consider aseries of amendments to the medium-range missile pact, the finalphase of a two-month process of intense examination.   The treaty was signed by Reagan and Gorbachev on Dec. 8. Iteliminates nuclear-armed missiles with a range of between 300 milesand 3,400 miles in Europe and elsewhere and provides the mostintrusive verification system in arms control history.   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the Foreign Relations chairman,said earlier he hoped the panel could complete its work by the endof the week, sending the treaty to the Senate floor for a voteexpected sometime in April. Vote tallies in both parties predictratification by far more than the required two-thirds or 67 votes.   The Intelligence Committee conducted its own review of treatyprovisions, concentrating on the U.S. capability to monitor Sovietcompliance with a variety of information-collecting techniques,including the use of spy satellites and on-site inspection.   ``The intelligence community will be able to monitor thedrawdown and elimination of declared Soviet missile launchers andassociated equipment with great certainty,'' the panel said in itsfinal report.   But Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the Intelligence panel'schairman, said that effective verification of a future pact cuttingstrategic intercontinental arms by up to 50 percent would require asignificant and expensive bolstering of U.S. intelligencecapabilities.   The committee recommended ``investing more in programs thatwould be most helpful in verifying a START treaty, in preventingtechnological surprise and in supporting U.S. policy and operationsin crises,'' Boren said.   Speaking for the committee, Boren said that because a StrategicArms Reduction or START treaty would not involve a ban on an entireclass of weapons but would rather impose limits on total numbers ofweapons that will make ``the detection of cheating far moredifficult.''   The Intelligence Committee said also that the extensive on-siteinspection requirements of a strategic arms treaty _ with Sovietinspectors given access to some of the most sensitive U.S. militaryfacilities _ could have a significant impact on U.S. intelligenceoperations.   It said that while it has overall confidence in the ability ofthe U.S. to detect Soviet cheating on the INF treaty, ``Sovietcompliance with some of the treaty's provisions will be difficultto verify.''   The panel noted, for example, that a controversy between theCentral Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Afencyover the number of SS-20 missiles in the Soviet arsenal remainsunresolved, with the DIA estimating a larger number.   But it said the treaty's ban on flight testing will ultimatelylimit the utility of any covert SS-20 force.</TEXT></DOC>
