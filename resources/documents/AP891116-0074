Gorbachev'scomments on the subject.   ``He who does not want to make decisions for our people shouldnot try to persuade them the best thing is a division of ourfatherland,'' Kohl said in his first speech to Parliament on EastGermany's historic border openings.   In East Germany, the leader of a political party long alliedwith the ruling Communists but now asserting independence said theCommunists' control of the government will be challenged during aParliament session Friday.   In another development, East Germany's Communist Party dailyNeues Deutschland announced today in a front-page report that itslongtime chief editor had been replaced. The report said the changeoccurred after the staff of the orthodox publication engaged in ``aconfrontation with the past.''   It said editor Herbert Naumann was replaced by WolfgangSpickermann to promote change at the newspaper, until now a forumfor harsh attacks on Western capitalism and even on the reforms ofGorbachev, the Soviet president.   Reunification has become an increasingly important topicfollowing the growing unrest in Communist East Germany that led tothe new government of President Egon Krenz and the decision to openthe nation's borders.   Gorbachev on Wednesday said talk about reunification ``wouldmean interference in the affairs'' of East Germany and West Germany.   But Kohl, who did not mention Gorbachev, said East Germans``must be able to decide for themselves, which path they want tofollow in the future.''   Kohl said West Germany would ``respect every decision made bythe people of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in freeself-determination.''   The chancellor claimed socialism is a ``total failure.'' A dayearlier, Gorbachev insisted the Communist revolution ``was not amistake.''   Kohl pledged to NATO and European Economic Community allies thatWest Germany remains committed to the integration in WesternEurope. Kohl also said ``solution of the German problem and theovercoming of Europe's division are inseparably linked.''   During today's debate in Parliament, former Chancellor WillyBrandt said he doesn't have the impression East Germans wantreunification soon.   ``Apparently they see the question of free elections as thematter of priority,'' said the 75-year-old Social Democrat.   British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd, commenting onreunification during a visit to West Berlin today, said it is notrealistic now. ``It is not actively on the agenda. ... It is notwhat people in the GDR (East Germany) are pressing for,'' Hurd toldreporters at the city's Reichstag building.   Krenz, who is also Communist Party chief, met with leaders ofallied political parties and the new parliamentary speaker,Guenther Maleuda, to discuss the other parties' call for a betterpower-sharing arrangement among the recognized political groups.   The official ADN news agency, reporting on the meeting, said theleadership wants a commission formed to draw all political andpopular movements into the reform process. Maleuda has called forthe creation of a multiparty government.   Manfred Gerlach, head of East Germany's Liberal DemocracticParty, said his country's constitutional guarantee of a ``leadingrole'' for the Communist Party would be challenged at Friday'ssession of the increasingly independent-minded parliament.   It was not known whether a vote on the change would come thesame day.   ``I figure it will pass with a large majority,'' Gerlach said inan interview with West Germany's ARD radio network.   Gerlach predicted free elections as early as next year and thatthe Communists would fail to win a majority.   Hundreds of people, meanwhile, waited on both sides of theBerlin Wall for a possible opening of a border crossing at theBrandenburg Gate. The gate, Berlin's best-known landmark, hassymbolized the division of Germany since the Wall was built in1961. East Berlin has opened 22 border crossings at the Wall sincelifting travel restrictions Thursday and there has been widespeculation that an opening at the gate is next.   In response to East German's move toward reforms, West GermanEconomics Minister Helmut Haussmann has offered massive aid similarto the U.S. Marshall Plan that helped rebuild war-ravaged WesternEurope after the Nazi defeat.   But the offer is conditional on fundamental changes in EastGermany's economic and political systems.   East German officials have spurned the offer, saying they prefertheir own recovery course. They have made it clear that they arenot ready to abandon their centrally-planned economic system.</TEXT></DOC>
