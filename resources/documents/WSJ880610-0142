When such a draft is presented for payment, the U.S. bank either receives notice that the Mexican bank doesn't exist or it receives a replacement sight draft drawn on a second Mexican bank, thus further delaying collection.    A sight draft is a check that is payable &quot;on sight,&quot; or on demand when presented to the bank on which it's drawn. Typically, banks don't question their use as they might a personal check because the bank assumes the funds have been collected in advance by the issuer of the draft.    The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating incidents of the fraud in at least four states -- Ohio, Missouri, Arizona and California -- and an agency spokesman indicated the practice is spreading. In several Midwestern cities, homeowners and small business operators are paying off mortgages and other loans using the worthless drafts.    &quot;This is serious because the financial community is getting flooded with these things,&quot; said Robert Siller, an FBI agent investigating the Ohio incidents. &quot;The losses can mount up.&quot;    Mr. Siller said borrowers are learning about the scheme at &quot;debtors parties&quot; held at hotels in various cities. There, salesmen seek to convince attendees they can pay off their loans immediately by using a Mexican bank draft. For a fee, usually about 15% of the amount of their loans, the debtors are sold a bank draft and told that lenders, by law, must accept the drafts.    In some cases, according to the FBI, the salesmen are members of anti-banking organizations. These groups believe the Federal Reserve System is unconstitutional and they are using the practice as a way to burden the Fed, which they claim is liable for the funds once a U.S. bank accepts the drafts.    Under an apparent technicality in federal banking laws, once a bank accepts such drafts and tries to redeem them, the borrower is off the hook. Furthermore, it is unclear whether banks that have accepted the drafts can legally collect the collateral used to secure the original loans.    In dozens of instances, U.S. banks have agreed to accept the drafts. And, according to Mr. Siller, at least one borrower -- a Sydney, Ohio, farmer -- got the deed back for his farm after paying off his mortgage with such a draft. His bank, which wasn't identified, has filed suit to collect on the debt, but the case is pending.    According to lawsuits filed by several banks, the certified drafts are drawn on Panora Credit Trust and by World Credit Reserve, both of Acapulco, Mexico. Some other banks have received drafts drawn on Central American institutions.    The FBI spokesman said it is still unclear how the salesmen are obtaining drafts from these foreign banking concerns, and whether the foreign banks even exist. And, he added, U.S. borrowers using them have been &quot;unduly&quot; uncooperative.    Huntington Bancshares Inc., which has accepted 10 such drafts from a few thousand dollars to nearly $100,000 according to a spokesman, has brought legal action in each case. However, none of the cases brought by the Columbus, Ohio-based banking concern has been resolved. The Huntington spokesman said the incidents involve small commercial loans and consumer debt.    &quot;This is just a burp in the system,&quot; said Larry Case, a Huntington attorney, who believes banks individually won't be hurt substantially but that it could become a national nuisance. Huntington no longer is accepting the suspect drafts and is sending them back to borrowers when they are mailed.    &quot;Until we get our dollars (from the Mexican bank), our position is that the loan is not satisfied,&quot; Mr. Case said.    The Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland recently issued a letter to its members advising them that &quot;bogus drafts&quot; were being passed in the region, and that the banks should &quot;take care&quot; inspecting them when presented for collection.    The regional bank noted the bogus drafts are often accompanied by a letter forewarning U.S. banks they may not be able to collect funds if they fail to use &quot;proper presentation&quot; under the Uniform Commercial Code. The Cleveland Fed said it doesn't view the letter as a &quot;correct interpretation&quot; of that federal code. </TEXT></DOC>
