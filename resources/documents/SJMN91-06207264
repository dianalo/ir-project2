Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, a leading advocate of thetransplants, said banning the procedure was &quot;a censoring of research,especially when so many people are looking to this research to give them somehope of cure from dreaded diseases.&quot;;    White House opposition to increasingresearch on women's diseases sparked a flood of angry comments by lawmakers onthe House floor Wednesday. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivancalled the provisions &quot;unnecessary&quot; in a June 4 letter to Congress.;    &quot;I askmy colleagues who deem the provisions in the bill unnecessary to considertheir wives, their daughters, their mothers before making this vote,&quot; saidRep. Marilyn Lloyd, D-Tenn., who recently had surgery for breast cancer.;   &quot;Don't tell this member, whose wife has fought eight years against breastcancer, who's lying in a hospital now, that breast cancer research isunnecessary,&quot; said Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn.;    &quot;How . . . could it beobjectionable and unnecessary to try and find a cure for breast cancer,&quot; askedRep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.;    The bill would add $50 million to the federalresearch effort on breast and ovarian cancers, both major causes of deathamong women.;    But in his letter to Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman ofthe House Energy and Commerce Committee, Sullivan said the extra expenditurewas not needed. He said the National Cancer Institute, a branch of theNational Institutes of Health, already is scheduled to spend $295 million forcancer prevention next year, including $70 million for breast cancerresearch.;    The secretary also said that a provision requiring theinstitutes to include women and minorities in most of its experiments is &quot;notrealistic.&quot;;    He wrote that allowing the institutes to issue grants forresearch on improving contraception could allow experiments the administrationopposes, such as work on living human embryos.;    And Sullivan said settingaside $40 million next year to increase research on osteoporosis, a bonedisorder that affects many older women, was not needed because the work isalready being done.;    The administration and conservative lawmakers haveeven stronger objections to the bill's provision expanding the use of fetaltissue to fight diseases.;    Such transplants, used to treat debilitatingillnesses like Parkinson's disease, now are performed using tissue fromabortions performed to save the mother's life or from miscarriages.;   Supporters of the procedure say it has proven promising and could savethousands of lives. They add that the bill contains safeguards that wouldprevent women from having abortions simply to provide tissue to help anotherperson.;    But opponents insist that expanding the frequency of fetal tissuetransplants would increase the number of abortions performed each year.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910725  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  592  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday July 25, 199100207264,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
