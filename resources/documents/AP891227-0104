Parliament convened Wednesday for a three-day session toconsider sweeping economic legislation that was proposed earlierthis month by the Solidarity-led government to transform theeconomy to a market system.   The government hopes by the end of the session that parliamentwill pass wide-ranging laws that aim to reduce the current 900percent inflation rate, make the zloty a convertible currency andreform the bloated state sector.   In addition to the name change, the constitutional amendmentswould remove 19 articles, including one saying the Polish People'sRepublic is a socialist state and another that mandates the leadingrole of the Communist Party in state affairs.   The prewar Republic of Poland was changed to the People'sRepublic of Poland in July 1944 when Soviet-backed Polishcommunists entered the country and proclaimed a Communistgovernment in Poland.   The package also calls for dropping the phrase that says the``Polish People's Republic will strengthen friendship with theSoviet Union and other socialist countries'' as well as removing aclause which refers to the socialist system in the Polish economy.   The amendments were presented first to the Solidarity deputiesby caucus leader Bronislaw Geremek who appealed to the union-backeddeputies to be present for the debate in parliament.   Geremek said an amended Constitution would serve as a temporaryone until a new Constitution could be drafted. The amendments mustreceive a two-thirds majority of the Sejm, as the lower house ofparliament is called, to pass.   The amendments also would create a provision for the formationof new political parties. As it is now worded, the Constitutionallows only the Communist Party, the Democratic Party and thePeasants Party to operate legally.   After the Solidarity-led opposition and Communist authoritiesagreed to partially free elections at talks this spring,union-backed candidates to parliament were forced to organizethemselves as a club rather than a political party because of thewording in the Constitution.</TEXT></DOC>
