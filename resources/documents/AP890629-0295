The investor group, Wings Holdings Inc., issued a statement fromNew York saying that its agent bank, Bankers Trust Co., had receivedcommitments for ``significantly more'' than the amount needed forthe purchase. It said the commitments would be adjusted to producethe required $3.35 billion.   Bankers Trust has agreed to commit $500 million toward an 8-yearloan, while Wings Holdings has pledged $700 million in equity towardbuying the Eagan, Minn.-based airline and related NWA subsidiaries.   Participating lenders are being asked to commit $100 million to$400 million each, said Tom Parisi, senior vice president at BankersTrust.   He said loans would be secured by all of Northwest's assets,consisting largely of more than $3 billion worth of aircraft.   The NWA board of directors last week agreed to sell the companyto Wings Holdings for $121 a share. Checchi's buyout offer to NWAshareholders holds through July 21. NWA and Checchi expect tocomplete the sale by Sept. 18.   Mike Hamilton, an analyst for the investment firm Piper Jaffray andamp;Hopwood, said the Wings Holdings announcement reinforced Checchi'searlier statements that he would have no trouble securing financingfor the deal.   Analyst Kurt Rivard of Dain Bosworth Inc. agreed.   ``This shows there's more than enough money available for them toclose the financing. And the positive thing is that it is bankfinancing rather than junk bonds. It shows Checchi has been able toconvince the lending institutions that there's value there,'' Rivardsaid.   ``It's another hurdle he had to get through and he's through thatone,'' he added.   Inanother development Thursday, the U.S. Department ofTransportation sent a letter to NWA, as expected, asking for moreinformation about the proposed acquisition.   ``Basically, they asked for details on management structure,financial forecasts, and explanation of the debt and equityarrangements,'' Hamilton said.   The request is part of the government's attempt to determine howthe acquisition will affect the airline's ability to operate,Hamilton explained.   ``To my knowledge, the DOT has not given any indication as towhen they'll have a decision on it,'' he added.   NWA stock closed at $115 a share Thursday, down [ on the New YorkStock Exchange for the second straight day.</TEXT></DOC>
