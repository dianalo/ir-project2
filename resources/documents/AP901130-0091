New Mexico climatologist Iben Browning created a furor acrossthe Midwest when he said last summer that there was a 50 percentchance of a strong quake on the NEw Madrid Fault within 48 hours oneither side of Dec. 3.   The fault runs from Cairo, Ill., to Marked Tree, Ark., about 35miles east of Memphis.   Browning's daughter, Evelyn Browning Garriss, has said thatactually the scientist thinks a quake is more likely outside theUnited States - especially in Japan. Ms. Browning says he based hispredictions on his observations of powerful high tides caused bythe alignment of the Earth, moon and sun. He says such forces cantrigger earthquakes.Tokyo, and there has been no outward sign of concern in Japanduring the past week.   The yen fell sharply against the dollar today, but dealersattributed the decline to market players seeking a safe investmentafter the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution to permit theuse of force to drive Iraq from Kuwait.   Kaneo Ogino, a dealer at Goldman Sachs (Japan), said of theearthquake rumors: ``People overseas are overreacting. I don't knowWhy stupid people are talking about an earthquake. We're ignoringthis bloody nuisance.''   Window-rattling earthquakes are common in Japan, and the countryIs obsessed with being properly prepared for the next greattemblor. Buildings and infrastructure are all designed withearthquakes in mind.   The most destructive shock in modern history was the ``GreatKanto Earthquake'' of Sept. 1, 1923, that destroyed a third ofTokyo and most of neighboring Yokohama, killing 140,000 people.Many perished in fires that raged through the largely woodencities.   The intensity of that quake is estimated at 7.9 on the Richterscale.   The strongest recent Japan quake was on March 6, 1984, alsoregistering 7.9 on the Richter scale. It caused only one death andneglibile damage because the epicenter was located deep below thepacific ocean seabed and well offshore.</TEXT></DOC>
