An intermediate court in the southwest China province gave LiangYongzheng the death sentence for selling seven panda skins for300,000 yuan, or $81,000. The other condemned man, He Guanghai,made 30,000 yuan, or $8,100, by selling skins, the agency said.   It said two of Liang's seven accomplices received life in prison.   The men were from Pingwu County, a major habitat of the giantpanda. The animal is native to China and only about 1,000 stillsurvive in the wilds of Sichuan and neighboring Tibet.   The Chinese government has forbidden hunting of the endangeredspecies, and courts in Sichuan have repeatedly called for harshpunishments of people caught killing or selling the animals.   Several offenders have been given life in prison, although thedeath sentence is rare for panda poaching.   The convicted have the right to appeal, but Chinese courtsrarely accept appeals and executions, with a bullet to the back ofthe head, are usually carried out within days of sentencing.</TEXT></DOC>
