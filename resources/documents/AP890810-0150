Mickey Leland and 13 companions were told a U.S.weather satellite picked up two emergency signals, one on Thursdayand one early Friday.   The satellite was passing directly over Ethiopia when it pickedup the second signal, far away from the first signal picked upThursday but still boosting confidence that it came from themissing plane.   The satellite read the second signal as coming at 1 a.m. Friday(6 p.m. EDT Thursday) from about 100 miles north-northwest of AddisAbaba, capital of Ethiopia. When the Texas Democrat's planevanished Monday, it was supposed to be going southwest, directlyopposite from where the new signal was detected.   ``We have greater confidence in this particular signal becausethe satellite was in a better position to make a location,'' saidRussell Koffler of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administrationin Washington.   The second signal was picked up on a different wavelength fromthe earlier one, but Koffler said the missing plane could broadcaston both wavelengths.   ``We are confident we got a good fix. We have more confidence inthis signal than in the one last night,'' said Koffler.   Officials believe the first signal came from 84 miles southeastof Addis Ababa. Both signals were far from the flight path Leland'splane would have taken to reach Fugnido refugee camp for whichLeland, chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, washeaded.   The camp lies 480 miles southwest of Addis Ababa and near theSudanese border.   Koffler said the second signal ``doesn't mean it's from thatparticular plane,'' but noted there would be few such sources fordistress signals in Ethiopia.   The first signal was picked up when the satellite passed overthe edge of Ethiopia's border and search teams set out on foot forthat remote mountain area.   Both signals were relayed from the satellite to a ground stationin India.   Leland took off Monday morning with eight Americans and fiveEthiopians for the Fugnido camp.   The twin-engine Twin Otter aircraft was reported missing Mondayevening.   The satellite picked up the first faint distress signal at 3:42a.m. Thursday (8:42 p.m. EDT Wednesday).   ``It could have been another plane flying over the area and thepilot fingered his microphone and the satellite picked up theblip,'' observed Robert Houdek, charge d'affairs at the U.S.Embassy in Addis Ababa.   James T. Baily, manager of the administration's search andrescue satellite program, said subsequent satellite passes couldnot confirm the signal because of radio interference.   Leland's plane was equipped with an emergency locatortransmitter, a device usually mounted in the tail of an aircraftand activated either automatically by impact or manually.   Two U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules cargo planes arrived Thursdayand spent three hours flying over the path Leland's plane wassupposed to have taken.   A U-2 aircraft also joined the search. U-2s are capable oftaking high-resolution photographs over a broad area and were oncecommonly used for espionage missions.   Four U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopters were expected to arriveFriday.   Four Ethiopian Air Force helicopters were also added, joiningthe U.S. fleet and more than a dozen light planes under thedirection of the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority.   Since Monday, the search has centered on a high, mountainousplateau near the Sudanese border, not far from the Fugnido camp.   There were reports on Monday that peasants heard a light planecircling one or two dirt landing strips in an area 50 miles fromLeland's destination.   ``The feeling is that the reports that we heard of a plane beingheard in that area mean that the pilot may have made a successfulemergency landing,'' said John Guerra of the U.S. Embassy.   ``The possibility is that the congressman's plane got past themost treacherous terrain and they're just sitting someplace waitingto be found.'' He said the group had some water and food, but notmuch. In addition, temperatures in the area can drop to freezing atnight.   On board besides Leland were three members of his staff; afriend; four Americans from the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Agencyfor International Development; and five Ethiopians, including threegovernment officials, the pilot and co-pilot.   Two congressional colleagues, Reps. Gary Ackerman and AlanWheat, flew to Addis Ababa to take part in the search.</TEXT></DOC>
