PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HAYRATAN, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Their faces reddened by the sun andstreaked with dirt, the sons of Russia drove a growling convoy ofarmor to the border of their homeland and the end of theirinvolvement in the Afghan war.   Three days out of the Afghan capital, Kabul, the thread ofmuddied military green on Sunday reached the Amu Darya River, whichmarks the border between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.   ``Of course, we're looking forward to going home,'' saidblue-eyed Andrei Ogarkov of Moscow, poking his head from the turretof a light tank, the seventh in the 65-vehicle convoy. He said hisseven months in Afghanistan were enough.   The convoy ground its way homeward through the Hindu Kushmountains and the Salang Pass, where heavy fighting occurred a weekago between anti-Marxist rebels and the Afghan army backed by Sovietartillery and warplanes.   Soldiers in the convoy said there was no fighting as they madetheir way north but that a few of their fellows were killed andseveral vehicles destroyed in an avalanche.   The Soviet soldiers will cross the border Monday, when anofficial welcoming ceremony is to be held in Termez, a border townin the Soviet republic of Uzbekistan. They bivouacked Sunday nightin Hayratan, along with other returning Soviets, and some said theyexpected wives and family members to greet them when they crossedinto Termez.   On Sunday, Mi-24 helicopters scoured the sand dunes along thehighway as the convoy finished its trip.   As they headed home ahead of the Feb. 15 deadline for withdrawalof all Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan, soldiers expressedambivalence about their nine-year military intervention anduncertainty about the shaky pro-Soviet government they leave behind.   ``The Soviet policy in Afghanistan brought nothing,'' said tankcommander Andrei Yevryolin, speaking to foreign reporters who rodefor an hour atop his tank until the convoy reached Hayratan.   At a military outpost near the northern Afghan city ofMazar-i-Sharif, 30-year-old Capt. Arkady Anonich bluntly answered``No'' when asked if he thought the local people supported thegovernment of President Najib.   He told journalists the Kremlin's decision to send soldiers toAfghanistan in December 1979 had been ``ill-considered.''   ``There should have been another way to settle this conflict,''he said.   Anonich said the Afghan army was weak in technical expertise andsuffered low morale.   Another Soviet army captain, Sergei Ofitserov, said, ``TheAfghans will have to work it out for themselves now. We will onlyget in the way.''   The convoy that reached the border Sunday included tanks, armoredcars, armored personnel carriers and trucks. Some trucks weremissile carriers, but their beds were covered with tarpaulins,making it impossible to tell if they were transporting missiles.   The convoy was part of a mighty armada of Soviet military powerthat has been heading north from Kabul in the past week. Soviet andAfghan officials in Kabul have estimated there are only about 1,000Soviet soldiers left in Afghanistan, including a garrison at thecapital's airport.   The convoy raised a trail of dust and exhaust fumes as it roaredup the main road to Termez, which is already indented by the tracksof hundreds of vehicles that have passed through during the years ofSoviet involvement in Afghanistan.   The column passed destroyed chassis' of jeeps and other militaryvehicles, the refuse of war, and outposts where armored vehicleswere dug into sand dunes to protect the withdrawal route.   As it ground its way toward the border, the convoy passed smallgroups of Afghans who watched silently, knowing that with the RedArmy's departure, the fate of Najib's government was more inquestion than ever.</TEXT></DOC>
