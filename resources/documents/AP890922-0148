WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The rush of ethnic Germans from EasternEurope promises greater wealth, a baby boom, stable taxes and asteady work force to power West Germany's economy, a study releasedFriday predicts.   The government-commissioned study, from the German EconomicsInstitute, warned of short-term problems including higherunemployment and housing shortages but said positive economiceffects should be felt by 1993.   West Germany already enjoys one of the world's most vibranteconomies, and experts now speak of a second ``Wirtschaftswunder'' _the postwar economic miracle that built an industrial giant from therubble of the Third Reich.   Immigrant contributions to the gross national product, a measureof national wealth, could be as high as $79 billion by the year2000, the Cologne-based institute said.   Its nearly 400-page report carefully skirted consideration of howthe picture would change if the two German states were reunited orif the recent stream of refugees were to continue or accelerate.   Government spokesman Hans Klein told reporters that 235,000ethnic Germans from the Soviet Union, Poland and other East blocnations have arrived in West Germany this year _ more than in all of1988. In addition, more than 100,000 East Germans have escaped oremigrated to West Germany.   Because Bonn recognizes East Germans as citizens, they are notcounted as ``immigrants'' with other ethnic Germans arriving fromabroad.   Some government officials predict as many as 500,000 ethnicGermans will arrive by year's end.   Klein described the stream as ``a great and multifaceted gain.''   But he reiterated ``it is not the political goal of thisgovernment that all ethnic Germans from abroad come to us.''   Bonn officials have been pressing East European leaderships towork toward improvements to make life better for ethnic Germansabroad.   While East Germans are a minority among ethnic Germans migratingto West Germany, attention has focused on them because of Hungary'sdecision to open its border with Austria and thereby provide anescape route to the West.   About 18,500 East Germans have fled through Hungary to WestGermany since Sept. 10. At least another 7,000 escaped illegallythrough Hungary in the weeks leading up to the mass release.   The economic report predicted the influx of East Europeans,excluding East Germans, would fall between 2 million and 3.5 millionover the next 10 years.   It said 14 million immigrants, refugees and exiles of Germanorigin have come to West Germany since the end of World War II.   They account for more than a quarter of West Germany's populationof 61 million.   Institute director Otto Vogel said, ``The immigrants bring withthem middle- and long-term improvements for growth and well-being, astronger public financial picture, stabilization of the socialsecurity system, a rejuvenation of the population, urgent relief ofmanual labor shortages and in general a more flexible job market.''</TEXT></DOC>
