Quotron, a unit of Citicorp, said its F/X Trader system,which will be available later this year, is faster and easierto use than other systems. It can, for instance, manage up tosix simultaneous foreign-currency trades on one screen.Systems owned by Reuters and Telerate, a unit of Dow Jones andamp;Co., can handle four transactions simultaneously, thecompanies said.</LP><TEXT>   Quotron noted it has planned for years to expand intoother financial-information services -- such as supplyingdata on foreign currencies and fixed-income instruments.   But it isn't certain whether the market is big enough forall three to prosper, even in a growing business whereforeign-currency trading volume in 1989 averaged $640 billiona day. Reuters said it already handles 40% of that volumethrough the 11,600 terminals it has installed world-widesince introducing its Reuters Monitor Dealing Service in1981.   &quot;Someone will succeed as an alternative provider,&quot; saidReuters spokesman Bob Crooke. &quot;The question is: Who?&quot;   Added Kenneth A. Hines, head of the Quotron F/X Traderproject: &quot;The conventional wisdom is there's definitely roomfor two. I can't comment on whether there's room for three.&quot;   The stakes are high. Reuters said it spent #59.7 million(US$100.3 million) last year on research and development,much of which was devoted to upgrading its foreign-currencytrading service. Dow Jones has said that developingTelerate's system and bringing it to market a year agoaccounted for $51.1 million in losses in 1989.   Mr. Hines said Quotron has invested &quot;nowhere near thatfigure&quot; in its service.</TEXT></DOC>
