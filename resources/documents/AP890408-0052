Officials from the three nations, along with U.S. and Sovietobservers, planned daylong talks at an undisclosed site north ofWindhoek.   Battles between the South African-led security forces and blacknationalist guerrillas occurred for an eighth straight day today,police said.   At least 262 guerrillas of the South-West Africa People'sOrganization and 28 members of the security forces have been killedin the heaviest fighting of the territory's 23-year war, policesaid.   SWAPO officials outside Namibia have disputed the figures andsay many civilians also have been killed.   South Africa called on the guerrillas to surrender by middaytoday or face intensified security-force action, but there was ``noindication whatsoever'' that SWAPO planned to lay down arms as thedeadline passed, police Chief Inspector Derek Brune said.   The South African-installed administrator of the territory,Louis Pienaar, said Friday there was a ``de facto suspension'' ofthe U.N. independence plan because of the widespread fighting nearNamibia's northern border with Angola. He said elections plannedfor November could be affected by the conflict.   Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, said he had informedU.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar about a SouthAfrican decision to activate an unspecified number of additionalsoldiers. A major reason for the move, Botha said, was that someguerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization wereapproaching areas where white farmers lived.   The United Nations has allowed South Africa to move a limitednumber of army troops from their bases to support anti-guerrillapolice units, but Botha said Friday that the security forces ``atthe present level are not able to stem the incursion.''   Botha emphasized that South Africa remained committed toimplementing independence in Namibia and that the U.N. plan had notbeen formally suspended. The U.N. Security Council said Friday itwas satisfied that South Africa still sought to grant independenceto the territory it has ruled since World War I.   After six months of an informal cease-fire, the fighting beganApril 1, the day the U.N. independence plan and a formal cease-firetook effect.   South Africa claims SWAPO has sent more than 1,900 guerrillasinto northern Namibia since April 1 in violation of an accordrequiring the insurgents to remain at bases at least 100 miles awayin Angola.   Col. Herman du Plessis, a territorial army officer, said anadditional 1,300 guerrillas were in southern Angola near theNamibian border and were ``an immediate threat.'' SWAPO leaderscontend most of the guerrillas had been in Namibia for some timeand have no intention of leaving for Angola.   Some U.N. officials have suggested that SWAPO field commandersmistakenly thought their units could return unmolested to Namibiaas of April 1 and set up bases. Several captured guerrillas havesaid they returned to Namibia in search of U.N. personnel andexpected no confrontations with the security forces.   The U.N. has authorized 4,650 troops for Namibia, but less than1,000 have arrived. Of that total, the only forces in the northernbattle areas as of Saturday were about 300 logistical personnel.   SWAPO has been favored to win the most votes in pre-independenceelections planned for November under the U.N. plan.   The way for Namibian independence was cleared in December whenSouth Africa, Angola and Cuba signed an accord calling forwithdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops who have helped Marxist Angolabattle U.S.-backed rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
