Industry Minister Roger Fauroux said the government willpump 4 billion francs into state-owned Bull -- 2 billion thisyear and 2 billion in 1992. Other officials said the money isto help absorb the computer maker's 1990 loss of 6.79 billionfrancs. Bull is projecting another loss for this year.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Fauroux said the state also will give Bull 2.68billion francs in special research aid through 1994, part ofa 14 billion franc program aimed at revamping its unwieldybasic operating systems.   Thomson, which also is state-owned, is to get 1.8 billionfrancs this year to help cover losses at its ailing consumerelectronics division. Thomson officials have said thedivision may not be profitable before 1995. It earlierlaunched a multi-year research effort aimed at developinghigh-definition television, in cooperation with N.V. Philipsand backed by the EC, which the French government also isfunding.   EC officials in Brussels said they don't yet know whetherthey will try to block the capital injections. But Frenchofficials said they are sure EC Competition Commissioner SirLeon Brittan will question the funding. They said Mr. Faurouxmet with Sir Leon a month ago in an effort to convince himthat electronics is a strategic area in which such aid isjustified.   Mr. Fauroux repeated that he wants to avoid letting Bullbecome a &quot;marionette in the hands of the Japanese,&quot; likeBritain's International Computers Ltd., which is 80%-owned byJapan's Fujitsu Ltd. ICL executives, annoyed by thecontinuing French criticism, reacted angrily to the state aidfor Bull.   ICL Chief Executive Peter Bonfield called the aid decision&quot;daft,&quot; warning that Bull could use the money to undercutcompetitors' prices. &quot;All this state aid just distorts tradeeven further,&quot; he said. &quot;If the French state goes on puttingin large amounts of money, they {Bull} are going to be a lossleader&quot; undercutting prices. He said ICL may raise the issuewith Sir Leon and possibly other EC officials.   The Thomson and Bull capital injections already arecontroversial in Brussels, splitting the EC Commission intopro-subsidy and anti-subsidy camps. Sir Leon and IndustrialAffairs Commissioner Martin Bangemann have been outspokenopponents of national subsidies.   &quot;We are against any policy of promoting nationalchampions,&quot; said a spokesman for Mr. Bangemann before thecapital injections were announced, but after the plan hadbecome known.   In theory, EC rules permit governments to inject capitalinto state-owned companies if the investment seems somethinga nongovernment shareholder would do. French officials insistthat this is the case with Thomson and Bull, despite thecompanies' losses.   But last week, Mr. Fauroux gave the newspaper Liberation adifferent view. &quot;No private shareholder would make the effortthat the state will make&quot; for Bull, he said. &quot;It is apolitical investment.&quot;   Mr. Fauroux also announced that France Telecom, thestate-owned telephone company, would help fund the capitalinjections. France Telecom owns a minority stake in bothconcerns, and will participate in proportion to its holdings,officials said. It also will cooperate with the companies inresearch.   France Telecom, which is profitable, tried to resistpumping money into the companies, but was ordered to do so bythe government. In an effort to gain something, FranceTelecom asked to be given control of a new joint venture tocontain Bull's activities in computer-linked corporatetelephone networks. French officials said such a jointventure will be created, but that Bull and France Telecomstill are arguing about whether it will be jointly run, ormajority-owned and controlled by the telephone company.   Officials said Bull would benefit financially from theventure. Bull's investment will consist of its internalnetwork business, which will, in effect, be recapitalized byFrance Telecom. France Telecom hopes to recoup some of thatmoney by charging the venture for its own services, but thatissue is also being debated.   Mr. Fauroux said he still favors finding a non-Frenchpartner for Bull, perhaps in the U.S. or elsewhere in Europe.But he said Bull can't make any major alliances until itsfinancial health improves.</TEXT></DOC>
