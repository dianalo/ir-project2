<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-57-1005 </DOCNO><TEXT>In a retrospective study including 106 patients, where the diagnosis ofthyroiditis had been established on the basis of cytological results,this was correlated with the corresponding clinical findings as wellas radionuclide and clinico-chemical data and subsequently compared withthe final diagnosis according to the definition of thyroiditis as givenby the German Society of Endocrinology. Thyroiditis was predominantlydiagnosed in females, who accounted for 85% of all patients showing thisdisorder. In 71% of these, the disease had occurred at any time duringthe 4th to 6th decade of life. The cytological diagnosis of thyroiditiswas confirmed in 96% by the subsequent comparative evaluations describedhere. For 41% of patients, where the original diagnosis had been derivedfrom cytological findings, no local symptoms like spontaneous and pressure-inducedpain, dysphagia, erythema and edema were reported. The laboratory parametersexamined gave evidence of inflammatory changes in not more than approx.one half of the patients actually affected by thyroiditis. The resultsdescribed here prove that diagnostic puncture is of irrefutable valueon thyroiditis, particularly incases where there are no visible clinicalsigns of the disease. (TRV).</TEXT></DOC>
