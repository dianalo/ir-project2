Hundreds of western wildfires _ most caused by lightning lastweek _ have destroyed 88,600 acres in California, Idaho, Oregon andWashington since Wednesday.   In Idaho's Boise National Forest, three blazes exploded into asingle firestorm overnight Saturday, generating cyclonic winds andoutracing firefighters, destroying 25 buildings in the resorthamlet of Lowman.   The popular Haven Lodge was destroyed, but officials could notsay how many homes or other commercial buildings were lost, saidForest Service spokesman Pat Entwistle. No injuries were reported,Entwistle said.   While crews pushed the flames away from Lowman, Entwistle said,they were bracing late Sunday to withstand another assault by theout-of-control blaze. ``They're expecting it to really whip upagain,'' she said.   National Guard troops were put on traffic-control duty toprevent looting in the town, population 150, about 50 milesnorthwest of Boise.   The Boise National forest blaze, which blackened 10,000 acres oftimber by Sunday, was among more than 400 lightning-caused blazesin central and southern Idaho.   In all, 38,400 acres of forest were charred by the blazes,according to the federal Boise Interagency Fire Center.   Lightning-caused forest and range fires in eastern Oregon forcedevacuation of 20 homes Sunday and of about 30 ranchers Saturdaynight, said Gay Brockus, spokeswoman for the Wallowa-WhitmanNational Forest.   The threatened homes were in the Stices Gulch area, and theranches were around Sutton Creek, both near Baker. A barn wasdestroyed in the Sutton Creek area outside Baker, but ground crewsand air drops of fire-retardant chemicals saved other homes,Brockus said.   In all, lightning-struck Oregon fires that began last week hadburned 27,000 acres of Oregon forest and range. In addition toblazes burning out of control near Baker, there was an uncontrolledfire Sunday in the Malheur National Forest east of the town of JohnDay.   In the foothills of California's Sierra Nevada, some of the2,500 people forced to evacuate over the weekend by a grass andbrush fire were allowed back home Sunday as firefighters tried tocontain the blaze on steep, inaccessible terrain.   The fire, which destroyed seven homes and 16 outbuildings andscorched at least 7,200 acres since Friday, was 60 percentcontained and not an immediate threat to any more houses, said U.S.Forest Service spokesman Mike LeFevre.   It wasn't known when the 1,800 firefighters would be able tocircle the fire above Fresno on the edge of the Sierra NationalForest.   Residents of Auberry and New Auberry were allowed to go homeSunday, more than 24 hours after being forced to flee the advancingflames, LeFevre said. But those forced out of several nearbycommunities were told to stay away.   For some residents of the rolling Sierra foothills, the weekendevacuation was a nightmarish reminder of previous disasters. Wilmaand James Gould were burned out of their Meadow Lakes home 27 yearsago and rebuilt in the same spot.   ``Once in a lifetime is enough. It's frightening. It'sfrightening,'' Wilma Gould said. ``We grabbed a change of clothes,a couple of blankets, our medication and that's all.''   Investigators said people or machinery caused the fire thatbegan Friday but still did not know if it was deliberately set. Twoother fires in the same general area scorched a total of 600 acresof land.   Elsewhere in California, a brush fire in the Cleveland NationalForest southeast of Los Angeles was reported 40 percent containedSunday after burning 4,100 acres of brush and destroying a houseand travel trailer. Its cause was under investigation.   A fire that burned 10,500 acres of brush and destroyed fourhomes near the central coast community of Atascadero, Calif., overthe weekend was fully contained Sunday.   In Washington state, a forest fire in the northern Cascademountains was held to 800 acres Sunday. Firefighters reported theblaze in the Okanogan National Forest 55 percent contained, saidU.S. Forest Service spokesman Greg Thayer.   The fire was thought to be started by lightning on July 14, butwasn't detected until July 23, Thayer said.</TEXT></DOC>
