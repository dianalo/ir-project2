(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Don't Plunge Into CaseandM;Several computer-aided software engineering champions warned an audience ofpotential users to complete some extensive studies of application developmentneeds before distributing tools to users.andM;&quot;That shouldn't come as a surprise,&quot; said Larry Constantine at Caselab '90,held in in Grand Rapids, Mich., and sponsored by the Research andamp; TechnologyInstitute (RTI) of West Michigan and Grand Valley State University.andP;  &quot;Thebest tools in the world do not a master carpenter make.&quot;andM;Fifteen years ago, Constantine helped create the structured design conceptsunder which many of today's &quot;upper-case&quot; technologies are based.andM;But Constantine admitted that he and his cohort, Ed Yourdon, were largelyunsuccessful in selling structured design, programming and, eventually,analysis to a technical public that resisted alternatives to flowchartcreativity.andP;  If structured techniques did gradually gain at least lip servicefrom MIS management, the pencil-and-paper media used for structuredtechniques did not.andP;  Hence the name for Case.andM;&quot;I think the most exciting possibility for Case-driven methodologies is whatthey will be doing to the old methods by obsoleting them not too long fromnow,&quot; Constantine said.andM;&quot;Now the tools are maturing, and they're creating new methods,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;Any time you have a different medium, you get new techniques.andP;  Case is goingfrom the static, like cartooning, to the dynamic, like video.&quot;andM;However, it is essential that MIS officials realize that the process must beimplemented carefully, warned Paul Jorgenson, director of RTI's Case ToolLaboratory.andP;  Jorgenson advises that companies avoid analyzing tools untilthey complete a long-range application development plan.andM;The RTI lab, which offers facilities to try out tools supplied by 19 Casesoftware vendors, cannot replace the need to analyze business requirements orthe company culture, Jorgenson said.andM;Jorgenson suggested that once the analysis is underway, MIS departments canbegin utilizing Case tools for the coding phase.andP;  Due to its history,software development cannot use the traditional engineering phases that beginwith analysis and design and continue through to construction, maintenanceand, finally, restructuring, he said.andM;&quot;But in software engineering, we started in the middle, in the coding[equivalent to the construction] stage,&quot; Jorgenson said.andP;  &quot;Of the whole lifecycle, our people are most comfortable with coding techniques, so why notgive them a tool to help them with what they're already familiar with, a toolto automate what they're already good at?&quot;andM;Jorgensen said MIS can slowly &quot;grow in the usage of tools and in thesophistication of the software process.andP;  They ought to go hand-in-hand.andP;  Toput the process in place, you can use information engineering--structuredanalysis and structured design--and maybe get a really good fourth-generationlanguage with a relational database and start using them at the same time youstart training people on the front end [the upper-case levels of analysis anddesign].&quot;andM;SHARON'S SEVEN PHASESandM;David Sharon, president of Case Associates Inc., an Oregon City, Ore.,andO;consulting firm, broke that process down further.andM;Tool selection, he said, should occur during the fifth phase of a seven-phase&quot;technology transfer program process.&quot;andP;  The first phase calls for &quot;assessingsoftware engineering practices and organization skills.&quot;andP;  That phase shouldbegin after a company defines its business goals, objectives andexpectations, and said Sharon.andM;Sharon estimated that each phase will last between three to six months.andO;Sharon builds overlap into his version of the system life cycle.andP;  Forexample, he said, by the time a company reaches the pilot-project stage after12 to 24 months, the so-called downstream phases have begun to alter the wayupstream phases work.andM;&quot;The people who are having the most problems with Case are the ones whobought tools as a panacea without realizing that Case changes the workflowand infects the culture,&quot; Sharon said.andM;&quot;There are two motivations for getting into Case,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;One is to finda quick fix.andP;  This is subscribed to by people who view the process as aproductivity problem, and they have a higher chance of failing than peoplewho come to Case because they have problems with software quality.&quot;andM;Gene Forte, editor of Case Outlook in Lake Oswego, Ore., added,&quot;Characterizing software development as a problem to be solved is like saying'easting is a problem to be solved'; as though we would want to permanentlyend the process of taking in food.&quot;andM;Clients of both Sharon and Forte utilize the RTI testing facilities.andM;Andrew Topper, president of Foresite Systems, Okemos, Mich., and an associateat the Case Tool Laboratory, agreed that most of those firms that have&quot;implemented Case tools and structured methodologies know that in most casesthe training and support costs far outweigh the software and hardware costsof implementing a Case tool.andM;&quot;When Case tools are used in conjunction with a structured developmentmethodology, they can often reduce development time and effort considerably,&quot;Topper said.andP;  However, &quot;when Case tools are implemented without a supportingmethodology they can provide minimal benefit, and may even prove to be morecostly than non-Case methods of software development,&quot; he added.andM;Tool Test LabandM;Whether or not a company should use exhaustive structured techniques todecide what they want to do and how they want to do it before they take alook at Case tools, the Research andamp; Technology Institute of West Michiganprovides 37 Case tools companies can test on a couple of dozen SunWorkstations for a daily rate of about $1,000.andM;RTI lists 19 tool vendors:andM;* Al Lee andamp;
