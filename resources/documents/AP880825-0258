(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Insilco Corp. said Thursday it accepted a$1.1 billion buyout offer from two Texas oilmen, tossing aside aprevious takeover agreement with a management-led group.   Under the latest arrangement, INR Holdings Inc., headed by CyrilWagner Jr. and Jack E. Brown of Midland, Texas, will pay $31.75 incash for each of Insilco's outstanding 25.6 million shares.Including debt, the deal has an indicated value of about $1.1billion, Insilco said in a statement.   In active trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Insilco closedup $1.12{ a share Thursday to $31.12{.   Two weeks ago, Insilco agreed to a management-led leveragedbuyout with First Boston Corp. But Insilco's board said Thursdaythat it had withdrawn its support of the $29-a-share offer, whichvalued the company at about $950 million.   Dissenting shareholders last week filed lawsuits againstInsilco, charging that management's offer was too low.   In a leveraged buyout a company is acquired largely throughborrowed funds that are repaid through the target company's profitsor asset sales.   Anaylysts had said higher bids would increase the chance a buyerwould have to sell at least some divisions of Insilco to financethe purchase.   Once a leading silver operation known as International SilverCo., Insilco restructured itself into an industrial holding companyand producer of specialty consumer and high technology products.   Several subsidiaries have wide brand-name recognition, includingRolodex desktop equipment, Red Devil paints and Taylor schoolyearbooks.   Insilco reported a flat overall earnings for the first half of1988, $21.7 million, or $1.02 a share, vs. $21.5 million, or $1.02,a year ago. But its profit from ongoing operations increased about11 percent and sales rose almost 21 percent.   Wagner and Brown are engaged in the exploration and productionof oil and natural gas, the operation of gas pipelines, real estatedevelopment and other businesses.   Earlier this year, the pair launched a hostile tender offer forUSG Corp., a Chicago-based building products concern. But Wagnerand Brown terminated their offer in June, a month after they lost abid for six seats on USG's board in a heated proxy contest.   To finance the Insilco acquisition, INR Holdings said it hasobtained commitments totaling $980 million from Wagner, Brown andMerrill Lynch andamp; Co.   The deal received the unanimous endorsement of a specialcommittee of outside directors, Insilco said. INR Holdings willbegin a cash tender offer within five business days of theexecution of a definitive merger agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
