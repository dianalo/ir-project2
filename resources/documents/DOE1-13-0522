They focus on fivepotential areas for extensibility: external data storage, storage management,access methods, abstract data types, and complex objects. Their approachemphasizes extensions written by knowledgeable programmers that are invokedas needed from within the primary database system. The authors show byan example how this method could be used to implement support for complexobjects. Although many questions remain unanswered, extensible relationaldatabase systems are a promising area of research.</TEXT></DOC>
