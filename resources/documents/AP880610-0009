At the same time, aides say, Dukakis is prepared to fend offattacks from Bush on foreign policy issues by reminding voters ofBush's ties to controversial Reagan administration actionsincluding the Iran-Contra affair.   Dukakis, who clinched the Democratic nomination with a sweep ofthe final four primaries Tuesday, says he is eager to debate theRepublican nominee-to-be.   Dukakis will promote his management of the booming Massachusettseconomy and support of universal health care. He also will point tothe Reagan administration's failure to promote affordable-housingprograms, and to the president's veto of a trade bill that requiredadvance notice of plant closings, Dukakis aides say.   On the international front, Bush has tried to depict Dukakis asa novice whose views pose a threat to national security. Aides sayDukakis will try to keep pressure on Bush by criticizing Reagan'spolicies in Central America. Dukakis also will continue to demandthat Bush fully disclose his roles in the Iran-Contra affair andadministration dealings with Panamanian strongman Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega, aides say.   Campaign aides are working on speeches and ads that listDukakis' major campaign themes _ competent management and newleadership for the 1990s _ while seeking to portray Bush as acareer politician without a true legacy.   ``If we're talking about our record, it will remind people thathe doesn't have one,'' Dukakis campaign spokesman Leslie Dach saidin an interview. He suggested that Dukakis will avoid directattacks on Bush but force voters to question the vice president'spositions.   ``If we talk about the tough stands Dukakis has taken, it willremind people that Bush hasn't taken any positions,'' Dach said.   Vital to any Dukakis fall strategy is a relatively smoothresolution of differences with Jesse Jackson and adoption of astrong but general platform that does not create the appearancethat Dukakis is beholden to special interests, the Dukakis campsaid.   Planning for the fall campaign is still in the early stages, butDach said Dukakis may use an approach used by Kansas Sen. Bob Dole,who sought the GOP nomination. The Dole campaign came up with an adthat showed a man walking across a field of snow, but leaving nofootprints.   In speeches, Dole questioned the vice president's record, sayingBush had an impressive resume but few actual accomplishments.   Some Dukakis aides already have adopted Dole's message in theirrhetoric.   ``He can't tell us or won't tell us what his role in thisadministration has been,'' said Dukakis issues adviser ChristopherEdley, a former Carter White House aide. ``He doesn't seem to leaveany footprints.''   Dukakis also plans to counter Bush's effort to portray theMassachusetts governor as a member of the ``liberal elite'' bypointing to Bush's privileged background. Dukakis is the son ofGreek immigrants.   ``I think it is very important to the American people that thenext president be someone who understands their problems and theirconcerns,'' said Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich.   While the Dukakis camp is uneasy over the prospect of conventionfights with rival Democrat Jackson, most Dukakis aides concedethose battles should help dispel Bush's characterization of Dukakisas an ultra-liberal in the mold of Jimmy Carter or George McGovern.   ``Bush's strategy seems to be to go out and attack somebody whoisn't even in the race,'' said Edley.   One issue that could put Dukakis on the defensive is taxes.   Dukakis has refused to rule out new federal taxes as a means ofreducing the federal deficit, while Bush has ruled out a tax hike.Dukakis also will have to sign a new state budget that includessome tax increases.   Recent national polls have suggested Dukakis has a double-digitlead over Bush. But Dukakis aides believe the race will tighten nowthat the primaries are over and voters can focus on the nominees.   Dukakis plans to campaign hard during the summer.   ``We're not going to make the mistake of underestimating GeorgeBush or the Republicans,'' Estrich said. ``They've got some verytalented people and they are going to have a lot of resources.''</TEXT></DOC>
