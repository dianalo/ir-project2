They said the guerrillas want to show they are still a forcedespite deep divisions in the rebel alliance.   The rebels have been battling to capture a provincial capital asa seat for a provisional government since the Soviet Union withdrewits troops in February after nine years of military intervention.   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theoffensive against Khost, 18 miles from the border with Pakistan,appears to be the most organized attack since February.   Naqib Sameer, deputy spokesman at the Foreign Ministry, noted anon-aligned summit conference opens Monday in Yugoslavia, and saidthe rebels ``want to show their power to the non-aligned conference.The opposition groups are trying to cover their previous defeats.''   The diplomats and Sameer said the rebels also want to be draw theattention of the United Nations General Assembly, opening this month.   Diplomatic sources said the government appeared to be havingtrouble recapturing two military posts at Tani, south of Khost,despite heavy use of the warplanes.   Sameer denied that Khost was threatened, saying the posts hadchanged hands a number of times since February.   He said the guerillas used artillery, rockets and machine gunsagainst government positions in the Khost fighting over the previous24 hours. He accused the Pakistani armed forces of supplying supportfrom across the border and claimed Saudi Arabian militiamen werefighting in Afghanistan.   Sameer said the Afghan armed forces were responding withaircraft, artillery and rockets.   Rebel failure to capture Jalalabad, 80 miles east of the capitalcity of Kabul, and recent internal clashes within the rebel allianceprompted questions in the U.S. Congress about further funding forthe rebels.   In place of Jalalabad, Khost, the capital of eastern Paktiaprovince, is considered one of the softer targets because itsproximity to rebel bases in Pakistan makes it easier to organizesupply lines.   In other combat, Sameer said government forces repulsed guerrillafighters in southeastern Kandahar province and around Jalalabad.   The government said the road between Kabul and Jalalabad was openagain. In Kabul, the almost daily rocket attacks since June haveebbed.   Sameer said a rocket hit Kabul on Thursday in the Qali-e-Naharhaneighborhood, killing one civilian and injuring two.   Diplomats said the lull was apparently from the guerrillasconcentrating their firepower on Khost and use of a new missile bythe government.   The government has been using Soviet-designed SCUD ballisticmissiles, with a range of 170 miles, to fire on rebel positions nearJalalabad and Khost from the capital.   A new short-range weapon, perhaps a Soviet rocket known as a Frog7, also is being used by government troops, the diplomats said. TheFrog 7 has a range of about 40 miles.   They said the new rockets, first noticed last week, apparentlyhave extended the security belt around Kabul.   Rocket attacks on Kabul since June have killed more than 300people and injured more than 900.   The rebels have been fighting to overthrow the soviet-supportedMarxist government for more than a decade.</TEXT></DOC>
