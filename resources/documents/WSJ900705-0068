Some 256 Sandamp;Ls thrash in conservatorship, a kind ofno-saver's-land between receivership and going on the block.&quot;It's like a ship with no rudder&quot; staying open pending sale,says Richard White, president of Midwest Federal Savings,Minot, N.D. Resolution Trust Corp. sends a managing agent whooften curtails activity. Generally not allowed: new loans;maturities beyond six months; top rates or ad promotions.That makes it tough to keep even the most loyal customers.&quot;We're not competitive,&quot; sighs Mr. White. Deposits fell 10%to $510 million at Midwest since the end of 1989.</LP><TEXT>   George Bragg, new president of Sooner Federal in Tulsa,Okla., visited every one of the thrift's branches to stemoutflows last year. &quot;I talked with 900 customers,&quot; says Mr.Bragg, who also has had political aspirations. Sooner lost$80 million of its $1.2 billion in deposits. Managers alsofled, but he says the thrift &quot;spread responsibility&quot; and nowhas &quot;a more efficient staff.&quot; RTC, meanwhile, speeds upsales.   RTC figures 60% of the thrifts were &quot;victimized bycriminal activity.&quot;                                                                                                          FIDO'S A FATSO, say pet food companies pushing new &quot;lite&quot;products.   &quot;Lots of cats and dogs sit with their owners and watch TVwhen they used to be out chasing birds,&quot; says ElizabethHodgkins of Hill's Pet Products. To combat an &quot;epidemic ofoverweight,&quot; the Colgate-Palmolive unit offers high-fiber,low-fat &quot;maintenance&quot; pet food as well as prescriptionproducts. Ralston Purina adds Pro Plan Lite for cats on thepaws of Tender Vittles Lite. Purina's Fit andamp; Trim for dogs --its pioneer product -- is still a big seller in the $5.8billion supermarket pet food field.   Snacks are always a problem: one extra-large Milk-Bone has254 calories. Ms. Hodgkins suggests withholding some ofdoggie's canned food, baking it and &quot;cutting it into littlebites&quot; for treats. Wesley Bayles, a Washington, D.C., vet, ismore generous, but he confesses to being overweight himself.&quot;My evaluation of a dog's weight may not be the same as someskinny veterinarian's.&quot; His own black Lab manages to stay atrim 72 pounds on dog food and the odd pizza crust.                                                                                                          FIRST-DAY DOCS lay hands on patients this month. Shouldyou be one?   The academic year begins in teaching hospitals as internsfresh from medical school join newly-advanced residents in achanging-of-the guard. Turnover of the so-called house staffmeans a patient can have one team of doctors on June 30 andanother on July 1 -- provoking anxiety all around. But arecent study led by Dr. Eugene C. Rich of the University ofKentucky College of Medicine, found that quality of caredidn't suffer during the summer months. However, the lengthof hospitalization rose -- and so did the bill.   The report, published in the Journal of the AmericanMedical Association, drew criticism from Dr. Jeffrey L.Kaufman, of Albany (N.Y.) Medical College, for countingreadmissions, death and nursing home placement rather thanmore relevant criteria like quality of written orders orcorrectness of drug dosage. His advice? Ask your doctor ifthe hospital has a transition strategy. If not, &quot;I'd say waita little bit.&quot; If so, &quot;it's perfectly reasonable to go in.&quot;Dr. Sol Sherry, former chief of medicine at Philadelphia'sTemple University Hospital, says overlapping the teams helpsgreatly.   &quot;It's a pressure cooker,&quot; Dr. Sherry says of thetransition. But &quot;we never had a great problem.&quot;                                                                                                          A ROOM WITH A VIEW isn't enough. In New York, HotelMacklowe promises to deliver faxes within minutes while theEmpire Hotel says voice mail assures correct messages forguests. Boston's Lafayette Swissotel rents cellular phones.

HAZARDOUS TO YOUR LOAN: Concern over toxic materialsclouds lending.   Commercial loans and multifamily housing projects havebeen subject to environmental audits for some time. Now, aslists of hazardous substances and potential liabilities growwell beyond asbestos and radon, some lenders feel the homemortgage may be the next big risk. There aren't the typicalbusiness-site hazards, &quot;but more lenders are becoming moresensitive to other kinds of problems,&quot; says Warren Tyler ofState Savings Bank, Columbus, Ohio.   Mr. Tyler, a former state EPA director, predicts lawnchemicals and drinking water are the next potential concerns.Others point to backyard, underground fuel-storage tanks. InMassachusetts, state law says prospective homeowners mustagree to remove lead-based paint from certain surfaces if achild under six will live in a house built before 1978. Butenforcement has been feeble. Part of the problem: budgetcuts.   Chemical Bank's first-stage environmental audit for amultifamily project costs $2,000 to $3,000.
