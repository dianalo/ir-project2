Assistance will be provideonly to the State Health Departments of Colorado, Maryland, and Missourifor continued support of this project. No other applications are solicitedor will be accepted.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> These Cooperative Agreements are authorized under section301(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241(a)) as amended.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number is 13.283.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Background/Objectives</ITAG>In September 1986, CDC awarded Cooperative Agreements to the Colorado,Maryland, and Missouri Departments of Health in support of their stateSCIP projects. The three States have fully staffed multidisciplinary teamsworking on the SCIP project. The States have developed the only state-of-the-artintervention strategies and materials developed from the results of focusgroups sessions conducted to learn from public prenatal clients what ismost helpful to them in quitting and maintaining cessation of smoking.The States have developed and tested the consent and screening forms aswell as the questionnaries and have already obtained local health departments'commitments to participate in the study. The three States have also standardizedprocedures for collecting and shipping urine samples, administering andshipping questionnaries, and editing forms, and they have installed a microcomputerdatabase for tracking patient progress and reporting.The primary focus of the renewal Cooperative Agreement awards will be to:1. Integrate the use of the patient education/counseling methoid withinintervention public prenatal clinics and WIC (Special Supplemental FeedingProgram for Women, Infants, and Children) sites on an ongoing basis usingonly existing staff to support clients' efforts to quit smoking. Theseclinics and sites will use only the data management and biochemical testingprocedures throughout the study period;2. Demonstrate the effectiveness of the smoking cessation/maintenance interventionstrategy in producing changes in the smoking behavior (i.e., quitting)of patients who use publicly-funded prenatal care on a sustained basis;3. Evaluate the effect of smoking on the birthweight of babies of womenusing publicly-funded prenatal care (higher risk patients); and4. Assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention as an integral partof prenatal care.CDC is committed to assisting the States in obtaining the study resultsin order to (1) assess what proportion of prenatal smokers can be helpedto quit smoking and maintain their cessation through intervention; (2)determine what it will cost to integrate cessation/maintenance interventionsinto routine prenatal care on a sustained basis; (3) measure the effectsof smoking cessation on low birthweight for users of public prenatal care,generally higher risk mothers; and (4) evaluate the cost-effectivenessof these efforts.CDC project activities are:A. Provide technical assistance and training to assure that State and localstaff have the appropriate skills and expertise to complete field testingas appropriate, to complete implementation of SCIP, and to evaluate itseffectiveness.B. Provide technical assistance in the development and conduct of training,quality control, process evaluation, data management, analysis, and evaluationto ensure sharing of experience between SCIP project States and sharingof their lessons learned with non-project States. This collaboration willinclude site visits when deemed necessary by the State or CDC.C. Perform laboratory analyses on SCIP urine specimens on behalf of theState and report the results back to them.D. Collaborate in the preparation and dissemination of information concerningthe SCIP project, activities, and results through appropriate presentationsand publications.Recipient activities are:A. Field TestingAs appropriate, complete the evaluation of the field test. Specify modificationsthat are needed in the intervention and data management instruments andprotocols.B. TrainingAs appropriate, conduct refresher training based on field test modificationsfor prenatal care (PNC) clinics and WIC staff that participated in thefield test.C. Quality Control and Process Evaluation1. Establish performance standards for acceptable adherence to the interventionand data management protocols.2. Establish systematic procedures for monitoring adherence to the interventionand data management protocols, and integrate the monitoring proceduresinto normal supervision of staff activities to the extent possible.3. Use monitoring information to assess adherence to protocols during andafter the study period.4. Assure that problems are identified and solved at the local and Statelevels as necessary.5. Monitor potential sources of influence on participants' smoking behaviorthat may stem from PNC or WIC staff, the patients themselves, media, ormembers of the community.D. Data Management1. Use the State patient/forms tracking system to generate reports thatare provided to PNC clinics on a routine basis.2. Ensure that all forms/urine specimens that are supposed to be receivedhave been received and followed up where discrepancies are identified.3. Document the condition of urine specimens upon receipt at the StateLaboratory.E. Analysis and Reporting1. Develop State analysis plan.2. Conduct State analyses.3. Review results with State health department program managers and policymakers.4. Complete analyses.5. Prepare SCIP evaluation (final) report.6. Prepare and disseminate information concerning the SCIP Project, activities,and results through appropriate presentations and publications.<ITAG tagnum="84">Eligible Applicants</ITAG>As stated above, the States of Colorado, Maryland, and Missouri are theonly three States that have the critical factors in place which permitthe SCIP Demonstration and Research Project to be successfully completedwithin the project period. The States have conducted focus groups' sessionswithin populations targeted for intervention to assess what should be mosthelpful in quitting and maintaining cessation. They have already estimatedsmoking prevalence by local health jurisdiction; have calculated samplesize requirements; and have obtained formal agreement from local healthdepartments to participate in the study as either an intervention or controlsite to be determined by randomization. The States have already developedforms and questionnaires to be filled out by PNC patients at enrollment,at the eighth month of pregnancy, and at six weeks postpartum. These formswere developed by the States without review or approval by CDC. However,technical assistance was provided. In addition, they have already developeda computerized database which can provide timely feedback to local healthdepartments regarding the status of the study.<ITAG tagnum="84">Review and Evaluation Criteria</ITAG>The review and evaluation of the renewal applications will be based ontheir merits when considering the following criteria:1. Overall Understanding.2. State Commitment.3. Measurable Objectives.4. Adequacy of Plan and Timetable.5. Acceptable Project Management Structure.6. Effective Problem-Solving Capability.<ITAG tagnum="84">Availability of Funds</ITAG>Approximately $350,000 will be available in Fiscal Year 1988 to fund threeCooperative Agreements, ranging from $100,000 to $150,000, for the firsttwelve months of a two-year project period. It is expected that the CooperativeAgreements will be awarded on September 1, 1988. Continuation awards forthe second year will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress in meetingproject objectives and on the availability of funds. Funds may not be usedto pay for recurrent costs associated with direct service delivery (i.e.,patient counseling and intervention).<ITAG tagnum="84">Application Submission and Deadline</ITAG>1. <T3>Copies:</T3> The original and 2 copies of the application (form PHS5161-1 Rev. 3/86) must be submitted to Ms. Nancy C.
