Portions of Reagan's diary also might be required as evidence,U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell ruled. However, he rejectedNorth's subpoena seeking Bush's testimony in the trial in whichNorth faces 12 criminal charges.   When North, who was indicted last March, walks into the U.S.courthouse near the foot of Capitol Hill, he will become the firstfigure in the Iran-Contra affair to stand trial.   Many of the same witnesses who testified in the nationallytelevised congressional hearings two years ago are expected to becalled by the prosecutors, including former Attorney General EdwinMeese III and North's secretary, Fawn Hall.   At North's side will be Brendan Sullivan, an aggressiveWashington lawyer who also represented North before thecongressional panels investigating the Iran-Contra affair.   At a hearing Friday, the government had sought to quash North'ssubpoenas seeking testimony from both Reagan and Bush as well asrecords from Reagan.   Gesell said North's lawyers have ``made no showing that PresidentBush has any specific information relevant and material to thecharges of the indictment which makes it necessary or appropriate torequire his appearance.''   But ``President Reagan shall remain subject to call on the ...subpoena'' served on him by North in December, Gesell said in athree-page order.   The judge said Reagan wouldn't be called as a witness ``unlessand until'' the court issues another order after giving the JusticeDepartment and Reagan's lawyers an opportunity to list theirobjections at a hearing.   Gesell quashed North's subpoena for Reagan's diary, except forwhat he described as a ``narrow exception.''   The judge said the diary subpoena would be ``subject to renewal''if North's lawyers support a claim that ``President Reagan ordered,directed, requested or, with advance knowledge, condoned any ofNorth's alleged false statements, document-removal or destruction''or other alleged crimes in the affair.   In congressional testimony in 1987, North said he hadauthorization from higher-ups in the administration for all of hisactions.   Gesell said Monday that if North can support a claim ofpresidential authorization for his actions, ``consideration mustthen be given to develop an appropriate production procedure fordetermining whether or not any aspect of such a claim finds supportin the diary and to the need to seek supplementing testimony fromPresident Reagan'' through written questions and answers or othermeans.   Unless North can do better than his broad request for informationfrom the diary, Gesell said, ``President Reagan's knowledge, would,generally speaking, be irrelevant and immaterial in the light of thelimited precise counts that still remain in the case.''   Gesell said Reagan has cooperated with independent counselLawrence Walsh and ``been responsive to requests for documents. Heremains willing to assist.''   Lawyers from Walsh's office were permitted to review typewrittenexcerpts from Reagan's diary a year ago, it was disclosed at ahearing Friday.   North is accused of concealing from Congress in 1985 and 1986 hisefforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras and of falsely tellingthen-Attorney General Meese that the National Security Council hadno role in diverting money from the Iran arms sales to the Contras.   The former Marine and White House aide also is accused ofillegally accepting a $13,800 security system at his home fromco-defendant Richard Secord, converting to his own use at least$4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader Adolfo Calero andconspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue in connection withcharitable contributions supporting the Contras.   Gesell on Jan. 13 dismissed the two central charges againstNorth, conspiracy and theft counts accusing him of illegallydiverting more than $14 million in U.S. Iran arms sale proceeds tothe Nicaraguan rebels.   Those charges were dismissed after a panel of intelligenceexperts in the Reagan administration, citing national securityconcerns, refused to declassify many portions of classifieddocuments that were deemed necessary for the prosecution or defense.   North was indicted last March along with former National SecurityAdviser John Poindexter and arms suppliers Secord and Albert Hakim.In June, Gesell ordered separate trials for them.</TEXT></DOC>
