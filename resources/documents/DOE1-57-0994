<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-57-0994 </DOCNO><TEXT>Mechanical and thermal properties of reinforced glass and glass-ceramiccomposites for structural purposes are discussed in terms of their constituentfibers and matrices. High-modulus fibers yielded high-modulus composites;high-strength fibers yielded high-strength composites. Both glass andglass-ceramic composites are available that maintain their propertiesat elevated temperatures. Properties of graphite/glass composites weremaintained to 500{sup 0}C (930{sup 0}F), while the properties of Nicalon/glassand Nicalon/glass-ceramic composites were maintained to 700{sup 0}C (1290{sup0}F) and 1250{sup 0}C (2300{sup 0}F), respectively. 16 references, 5figures, 2 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
