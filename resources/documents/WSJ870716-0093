The fungicides are mancozeb, maneb, metiram, nabam and zineb. Each degrades into ethylenethiourea, which has been shown to cause tumors, birth defects and thyroid damage in tests on laboratory animals. Special reviews can lead to restrictions on the use of pesticides or, in rare cases, to their outright banning.    According to the EPA, about 18.5 million pounds of these pesticides are used annually in the U.S. The agency said the U.S. makers of the pesticides include Du Pont Co., Wilmington, Del.; Rohm andamp; Haas Co., and Pennwalt Corp., both of Philadelphia; FMC Corp., Chicago; and BASF Corp., Parsippany, N.J., a unit of BASF AG, West Germany.    The EPA had conducted a high-priority study of the risks and benefits of these chemicals in 1977. That study ended in 1982 with a conclusion that there was insufficient evidence of human risks from the chemicals to justify regulatory action.    The agency then required tests that provided added evidence of risk to people handling the chemicals and eating contaminated foods. That, according to Jay Ellenberger of the agency's Special Review Branch, led to the new, intensive risk and benefits assessment. </TEXT></DOC>
