L. 99-576), and the New GIBill Continuation Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-48). These provisions permitapprenticeship and on-job training and correspondence training in the MontgomeryGI Bill. The provisions also prohibit receipt of benefits under two ormore of the education programs administered by VA. This will result ina sharp reduction in benefits to a few veterans.VA finds that good cause exists for making the amendments to andSection;andSection;21.7000(a),21.7040(a), 21.7042(a)(1), 21.7042(b)(1), 21.7042(d)(1), 21.7042(e)(1),and 21.7044(c)(1), like the law which they implement, retroactively effectiveon June 1, 1987. Except for andSection;21.7152, VA finds that good causeexists for making the remainder of these regulations, like the sectionsof the law they implement, retroactively effective on October 28, 1986.To achieve the maximum benefit of the legislation for the affected individuals,it is necessary to implement these provisions of law as soon as possible.A delayed effective date would be contrary statutory design; would complicateadministration of these provisions of law; and might result in denial ofa benefit to a veteran or servicemember who is entitled by law to it, orin the granting of a benefit to a veteran or servicemember who is not entitledto it.VA has determined that these proposed regulations do not contain a majorrule as that term is defined by E.O. 12291, entitled Federal Regulation.The regulations will not have a $100 million annual effect on the economy,and will not cause a major increase in costs or prices for anyone. Theywill have no significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has certified that these proposed regulations,if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the proposedregulations, therefore, are exempt from the initial and final regulatoryflexibility analyses requirements of andSection;andSection;603 and 604.This certification can be made because the regulations affect only individuals.They will have no significant economic impact on small entities, i.e.,small businesses, small private and nonprofit organizations and small governmentaljurisdictions.A Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number has not been assigned forthe program affected by these regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 21</ITAG>Civil rights, Claims, Education, Grant programs_education, Loan programs_education,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Schools, Veterans, Vocationaleducation, Vocational rehabilitation.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: March 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.
