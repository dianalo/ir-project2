The golden goose of takeovers and leveraged buy-outs is generating mammoth profits for takeover speculators and huge fees for investment bankers. But Wall Street pros are fretting that the next megadeal could cripple the game by creating a backlash from politicians and regulators.    &quot;Do I sense fear? Yes,&quot; says Martin Weinstein, who runs Kubera, a New York risk-arbitrage firm. &quot;At some point, there is a rebellion against greed.&quot;    While few professionals expect a government crackdown on takeovers any time soon, the feared backlash is the talk of the Street, and there were rumblings from Washington yesterday that some of those nightmares might come true.    &quot;You had to be Rip van Winkle in the last month not to worry about a backlash,&quot; contends Michael Steinhardt, who runs a New York investment partnership. But he adds: &quot;I don't think there will be any profoundly restrictive legislation.&quot;    The worries are creating some strange situations. As rumors swirled last week about the possibility of a bid for Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., some takeover-stock players and money managers cringed -- even as they scrambled after the stock.    &quot;God, I hope that (the takeover) doesn't happen,&quot; one money manager said. At the rumored $60 a share, a bid for Sears would cost nearly $23 billion. &quot;We're talking about middle America here,&quot; he said. &quot;People wouldn't stand for this.&quot;    Some pros see the problem as a reprise of the age-old tensions between Wall Street and Main Street. But this time, in an odd twist, Main Street is funding many of the takeovers through pension funds' contributions to LBO funds.    The Street's dilemma is painfully obvious. Takeover plays have become virtually the sole engine for an otherwise listless market. Analysts and brokers desperately peddle takeover and restructuring plays to investors to generate commissions; meanwhile, money managers hope to beef up lackluster returns by discovering tomorrow's takeover group.    But even as they reap profits from deal stocks, money managers acknowledge that the corporate debt generated by takeovers and LBOs may be ballooning to dangerous levels. Many pros realize that an economic slowdown could push some highly leveraged companies into bankruptcy.    &quot;There's a tremendous negative case to be made against this,&quot; says Harvey Eisen, president of Integrated Resources Asset Management, a New York money management firm, which has held such deal stocks as Lucky Stores Inc. and Kroger Co. But, he says: &quot;It's really one of the only places you can make money.&quot;    Even some LBO firms are concerned. &quot;Anybody who's got his head screwed on in the right direction has got to say, yes, they're worried&quot; about the recent type and size of deals, says Joseph L. Rice III, president of Clayton andamp; Dubilier, noting that some recent forays by LBO firms are closer to hostile takeover bids than the traditional friendly management deals.    So like a bad child waiting to be punished, Wall Street keeps an eye on Washington. Yesterday, Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) fired a volley against the LBO wave, raising the possibility of closing the loopholes that allow for the deductibility of interest payments used for LBO financing.    Market professionals -- often said to have time horizons measured in hours -- have no trouble remembering October 1987, when Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) offered up a similar proposal. The bill was cited as a trigger for Black Monday. (Takeover stocks fell on yesterday's Dole statement, but quickly rebounded.)    So Wall Street is gazing into its crystal ball, trying to figure out what steps, if any, Washington might take. &quot;I don't think legislation could come before next February,&quot; says Neil J. Weisman, who heads Chilmark Capital Corp. in New York.    The threat of legislation, he adds, could accelerate the pace of deals before year-end.    Robert Willens, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York, calls the proposal to eliminate LBO deductions &quot;politically unpalatable,&quot; citing last year's crash.    One alternative is for the government to make stock-based deals more attractive than LBOs, which are financed largely with debt. Under one plan, dividends paid on stock would be deductible. &quot;I would expect that's the way Congress would go,&quot; Mr. Willens says.    A congressional joint committee on taxation, comprised of staffers from the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, is studying the problem, he says, and is likely to complete that study during the next congressional term.    Timothy G. Dalton Jr., president of Dillon Read Capital Management, argues that it is more likely the takeover binge will end on its own before legislation is enacted. &quot;You have a lot of different parties showing concern for different reasons,&quot; he says, in reference to federal regulators and corporate chief executives, among others. &quot;It would take a lot of prodding to get a meeting of the minds.&quot;    One money manager already is looking past the current merger boom. &quot;The Street is starting to say to itself, 'What are we going to do next year?'&quot; she says. &quot;These major LBOs, major takeovers and massive restructurings: I'm going under the assumption that the majority of these will be completed by the end of the year.&quot; After that, she says, the Street will move on to something else. </TEXT></DOC>
