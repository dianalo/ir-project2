Last year, the SantaClara, Calif., manufacturer lost part of a valued contract to IBM, whichstepped up manufacturing of its own drives and turned to other drive makersas second sources.andM;Such a loss of OEM revenue has been doubled by a cut in retail sales,industry analysts said.andP;  Whereas users and dealers used to install drivesthemselves, many systems manufacturers are now shipping PCs that already havehard drives.andP;  The continued decline in disk prices and the increasedcompetition among PC firms makes the inclusion of a hard drive par for the1989 course.andM;Stick by Strong MakersandM;Because of these factors, the disk-drive industry is being whittled down tojust a few manufacturers.andP;  CORE's Simonds cautions users to choose productsfrom drive makers that show signs of stability.andM;''What we say to users is, 'Not if, but when, your disk fails, are you goingto be able to get it replaced?' '' Simonds said.andP;  ''There aren't a lot of newplayers in the disk-drive industry, and people know who's healthy.andP;  But withmanufacturers competing with each other on price without the margins theyneed to get by, even strong manufacturers are in trouble.''andM;A disk is an expensive item to make, Simonds said.andP;  In this area, as much asany other, you get what you pay for.andM;The tape market may be confusing because of competing technologies, and thedisk market may be falling prey to competition among manufacturers, but thenascent optical industry is driven most by applications, said Dataquest'sDevin.andM;Thus far, three technologies have taken hold of the optical-storage market:compact disk, read-only memory (CD ROM), used mainly as a mass-distributionmedia; WORM, most often used for archival storage; and erasable optical ormagneto-optic (MO), the most likely of the three to become standard storageequipment, according to industry analysts.andM;Capacities for MO drives typically range from 200M to 500M bytes.andP;  The mostpopular drives are ones that can be installed into a storage bay on the frontof the machine, with a removable cartridge on which data is stored.andP;  Industryvisionaries predict that MO drives will be especially useful for collegestudents -- they'll be able to store four years of work on a single cartridgeand carry it with them.andM;Erasable optical media are still too unreliable, though, to cut heavily intothe standard disk-drive market share, according to Devin.andP;  Typically, thedrives are also slow.andP;  It's claimed that the faster fixed hard disks soldtoday have access times of 18 milliseconds, but an erasable disk's accesstime is often 10 times greater.andM;WORM drives are used in applications that require the utmost data integrity.andO;Because data stored on the disks cannot be erased or tampered with, law firmsfind them useful.andP;  Libraries also store data to WORM drives in archivalapplications.andM;CD ROM, which stores as much as 600M bytes of data per disk, is starting tobe used as a publishing tool.andP;  Software publishers such as Microsoft Corp.andO;have introduced CD ROMs that contain reference works and literature.andP;  About100 titles are available on CD ROM, Devin said.andM;Because CD ROM combines the capacity of erasable drives with the archivalreliability of WORM drives, it may represent the future of storage, Devinargues.andP;  ''Someday, when you get a writeable CD, you'll get an interestingproduct,'' he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
