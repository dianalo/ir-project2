(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush and Michael Dukakis todaypointed their campaigns southward after decisive New Hampshirevictories, and Bob Dole promised to counterattack unless the vicepresident stops ``distorting the Dole record.'' Bush denied he haddone anything wrong.   Richard Gephardt, who finished second to Dukakis, said he was inthe race to stay. However, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, third amongDemocrats in New Hampshire after finishing second in Iowa, said hewill have to drop out unless he can win next week in either SouthDakota or Minnesota. Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt said he had``a divided mind'' about whether to continue but that Jesse Jacksonhad already asked for his support if he should drop out.   Dole, the big Republican winner in Iowa last week, said Bush'scomeback victory in New Hampshire was at least partly due to BushTV commercials that Dole said distorted his record.   ``I'm going to try to go out and straighten it out,'' he said atthe Manchester, N.H., airport before flying back to Washington.``I'm not going to run from it. I'm not known for running from afight.''   Bush, who returned to Washington Tuesday night, was reluctant totalk about Dole's accusation. However, when questioned during abrief exchange with reporters today, he replied, ``I think I saidit wasn't true, but I'll be glad to say that.''   ``You all want me to talk about Sen. Dole. I want to talk aboutthe issues,'' Bush said. ``I'm not going to dwell on it, you see, Idon't want to be drawn into something like that.''   Bush added, ``People in New Hampshire like clean campaigns, andthey endorsed me overwhelmingly.''   Tuesday night, Dole had accused Bush of ``lying about myrecord.''   Bush, asked about that in an interview taped for CBS-TV today,said, ``I'm sorry he feels that way.''   Were you lying? Bush was asked.   ``No,'' he answered quietly.   Bush won 38 percent of the Republican vote _ and 11 delegates tothe GOP convention _ in complete returns. Dole had 29 percent ofthe vote and seven delegates. They were followed by Rep. Jack Kempof New York, former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont and formertelevision evangelist Pat Robertson.   Dukakis lived up to expectations by carrying his neighboringstate by 16 percentage points over Rep. Gephardt of Missouri, lastweek's winner in Iowa.   The turnout was a record _ 154,012 Republican voters and 119,041Democrats for a total of 273,053 compared with 261,243 in 1980.This year's figure was estimated to represent a bit less than halfthe state's registered voters.   In other comments today:   _Dukakis, who won by a big margin in a state borderingMassachusetts where he is the governor, said on ABC-TV that he canalso do well in the South, which dominates the Super Tuesdayprimaries on March 8. ``People in the South aren't voting for a ZIPcode; they're voting for the president of the United States,'' hesaid.   _Simon said on NBC-TV he would have to win next week,``otherwise, I'm going to have to withdraw. ... You just can'tcontinue to run second and third.''   _Gephardt said on ABC that whoever remains in the race, hehimself will ``do well because we're connecting with the voters onmy ideas.''   _Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, who beat out former televisionevangelist Pat Robertson and former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont forthird place among the Republicans, said his showing proved hisstanding among the conservatives who form the base for himself, duPont and Robertson.   _Robertson, on the other hand, said, ``This was a small spreadbetween Jack and me.'' He added, ``New England is not my naturalconstituency. ... Going into the South, it's a different ballgame.''   ``On to the South, where we're going to rise again,'' exclaimeda euphoric Bush late Tuesday night. He won a solid victory afterseeing his earlier 20-point lead in the polls melt in New Hampshireafter his embarrassing third-place finish in Iowa behind Dole andRobertson.   For all the attention they got, Granite State voters managed tokeep the presidential races in both parties in turmoil, offeringjust enough support to also-rans to give them an excuse to struggleon toward Super Tuesday, with its enormous 20-state risks andrewards.   Among the Republicans, Kemp finished third with 13 percent, andthree delegates. Du Pont edged out Robertson, 10 percent to 9percent. Du Pont's total was high enough to win two delegates;Robertson got none.   In the delegate totals, after Bush's 61 came Dole with 42, Kempwith 35 and du Pont with two. The winning Republican needs 1,139delegates.   Among the Democrats, after Dukakis, with 36 percent of the voteand nine delegates, came Gephardt with 20 percent and six delegatesand Simon with 17 percent and three delegates.   The other Democratic finishers _ Jackson with 8 percent, Sen.Albert Gore Jr. 7 percent, Babbitt 5 percent and Gary Hart 4percent _ didn't do well enough to pick up any delegates.   In the delegate totals, after Dukakis' 44.5 came Gephardt with39 and Simon with 33. The victorious Democrat needs 2,082 delegatesfor the nomination.   Though he got no delegates, Jackson said he was ``happy becausein Iowa and New Hampshire we proved we could broaden our base.''Asked how he expected to do in the South, he said, ``I expect towin.''   Bush was exultant at his showing. Quoting Mark Twain, he said,``Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.''   Dukakis belittled Gore's regional strategy.   ``Tomorrow, we head South,'' said the Massachusetts governor.``I don't have a Southern strategy,'' he said. ``I don't have aNorthern strategy or a Western strategy. I have an Americanstrategy.''   Six states will vote before Super Tuesday, but it was clearTuesday night that the campaigns were looking ahead to March 8 when20 states on the Democratic side and 16 on the Republican willoffer the biggest one-day delegate prize of the campaign.   Minnesota and South Dakota take the spotlight next. Republicansand Democrats hold caucuses in Minnesota and primaries in SouthDakota next Tuesday.   In the New Hampshire Democratic primary, Gephardt and Simon,fighting for Democratic runner-up, were also in a battle for money.Both campaigns are in financial trouble and needed a second-placefinish to keep contributions coming in.   With a first in Iowa and a second in New Hampshire, Gephardt wasable to claim, ``I'm in good shape.''   South Carolina's Republican primary is Saturday, March 5, threedays before Super Tuesday.   Gore, the Tennessee senator who passed up Iowa and spent lesstime than his rivals in New Hampshire, watched the returns fromHouston, Texas, where he said ``Super Tuesday changes all therules. It's a completely new ballgame.''</TEXT></DOC>
