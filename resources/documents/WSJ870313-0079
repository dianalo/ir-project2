The insurance agency said it will pay off insured depositors in one of the banks, Plaza National Bank, Del Rio, Texas, because there were no bids to acquire the closed institution. Plaza had assets of $34.8 million and held deposits of about $30.4 million in 2,500 accounts, including a total $38,000 in 15 accounts above the $100,000 insurance limit.    First National Bank of Olney, in Olney, Texas, was closed by the comptroller of the currency and will open today as First National Bank of Olney, a newly chartered subsidiary of Olney Bancshares Inc., also based in Olney. First National had assets of $15 million and held deposits of $13.4 million in 2,700 accounts.    Western Bank, El Paso, Texas, was closed by state regulators and will open today as a unit of MBank El Paso, which in turn is a unit of Dallas-based MCorp. Western had assets of $39.7 million and deposits of $39 million in 4,900 accounts.    Expressway Bank, Oklahoma City, was closed by state regulators and will open today as a branch of First Interstate Bank of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, a unit of First Interstate Bancorp., Los Angeles. Expressway had assets of $20.6 million and deposits of $17.6 million in 2,400 accounts.    The FDIC said 15 banks have failed this year in Texas and nine have failed in Oklahoma. </TEXT></DOC>
