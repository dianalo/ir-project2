Just call himthe Johnny Appleseed of the electronic frontier.   The Urbana, Ill., systems analyst is the father of ProjectGutenberg, an ambitious and possibly quixotic scheme to copythe text of 10,000 books into electronic form and distributethem at next to no cost. His target: the 100 millioncomputers he believes will be out there waiting by the turnof the century.</LP><TEXT>   In 44-year-old Mr. Hart's utopia, the classics should beaccessible to anyone at the stroke of a computer key. &quot;I wanta world where this stuff is available,&quot; he says. &quot;Where youcan walk into a public library and get 90% of the informationyou need copied on a disk that you don't have to return.&quot;   His freedom of information campaign inspires a fair amountof skepticism. At a recent speech in New Haven, Conn., he wasasked: &quot;Are you a Communist, or are you just generous?&quot;   For 20 years, Mr. Hart has been typing away in solitaryobscurity, stockpiling books on floppy disks, CD-ROMs,optical disks and the hard drives of the 30-or-so computersthat clutter his 100-year-old brick home in Urbana.   &quot;Until three years ago, you couldn't pay people to takethese books,&quot; he says. &quot;People looked at me like I wascrazy.&quot; At that time, there wasn't a critical mass ofpotential readers connected to his main avenue ofdistribution: Internet, the electronic highway linkingcomputers at universities, government agencies and other biginstitutions around the globe. And downloading something likethe Bible, he explains, chewed up too much disk space.   But as networking and computer memories have mushroomed --more than 500,000 computers are now tied to the Internet --Mr. Hart's idea has drawn fewer hoots of derision. Hismonthly Project Gutenberg newsletter -- with items on newreleases, the codes for obtaining texts, and the like -- goesout to about 10,000 computer addresses, and from there, intothe electronic ether. Unlike most commercial electronic textson the market, he explains, Gutenberg's aren't tied tospecific hardware or software. So besides being free, theycan be read by any machine.   He now has about 1,000 texts in various stages ofplanning, typing, proofing and copyright analysis. So far,two dozen titles -- including &quot;Moby Dick&quot; and &quot;The Song ofHiawatha&quot; -- have been released, at a current rate of one permonth. He plans to double the output every year to meet his2001 goal of 10,000 books.   Production is picking up, thanks to electronictext-scanning devices and a worldwide cadre of about 40volunteers -- mostly scholars, librarians and otherprofessionals -- who help turn printed matter into digitaltext.   Judith Boss, a professor of English at the University ofNebraska in Omaha, learned of Gutenberg through her regularon-line discussions with other academics. (She belongs toelectronic forums on Shakespeare, on writing, and one linkingsome 2,000 humanists.) Dr. Boss spent several dayskeyboarding in the 1667 edition of John Milton's &quot;ParadiseLost&quot; for Project Gutenberg.   Much academic scut work would become immeasurably easierfor those with access to his texts, Mr. Hart says. Textscould be searched to find quotations or key words in, say,&quot;Hamlet.&quot; Special computer programs can analyze and compareelectronic texts to determine, for example, who the author ofan anonymous work might be.   Mr. Hart's gateway to the Internet is a mainframe computerat the University of Illinois campus in Urbana-Champaign.(Although Mr. Hart has no official connection to the school,a professor gives him access to the computer.)   Mr. Hart is an adjunct professor at Illinois BenedictineCollege in Lisle, where his sole responsibility is buildingelectronic libraries. Its campus library is the forerunner ofwhat he'd like to see everywhere: It stores full electronictexts of books that students can download onto disks andkeep.   Often, Mr. Hart's volunteers type up their favorite bookand send it in over the electronic transom. &quot;I got the `Bookof Mormon' just yesterday,&quot; Mr. Hart says. &quot;Somebody sent us`A Comedy of Errors' last year, and now he's doing `TheFederalist Papers' for us.&quot;   Some people, Michael Hart being one of them, &quot;live&quot; on thenetwork, joining a subculture where time and space havelittle meaning. At 2 a.m. he may pad down to his basement andthe bank of six computers that serve as Gutenberg Central.Donning headphones and sinking into an ergonomic chair, hebegins his daily grind: text-scanning, proofreading andmonitoring electronic communiques.   &quot;I get a quarter of a megabyte of e-mail a day,&quot; he says.&quot;Here's one from the guy looking for `King Arthur,'&quot; a volumethat has disappeared into the bowels of a mainframesomewhere. There are also proofreaders' corrections on &quot;Alicein Wonderland,&quot; and a couple of messages for Mary BrandtJensen, who heads the law library at the University of SouthDakota and conducts most of his copyright searches.   Mr. Hart, who restricts himself to works in the publicdomain, is a stickler about copyright. A 1976 change in thelaw extended copyright protection to many books thatotherwise would have entered the public domain. This forcedMr. Hart to abandon some nearly-completed projects, like a40-volume edition of Shakespeare. Not surprisingly, bookpublishers aren't eager to identify which books have enteredthe public domain. &quot;They do everything to make it hard forme,&quot; Mr. Hart says.   He also has tangled with academics. Some, he says, declineto donate electronic texts to Gutenberg because of its policyof unlimited distribution. &quot;A lot of people don't want toteach you what they know,&quot; he sputters. &quot;How can you have anelectronic text of Plato and want to keep it away fromeverybody? It's feudalism]&quot;   But a scholar who works with electronic text complains ofProject Gutenberg's &quot;aimless&quot; quality. He scoffs at &quot;all thegood boys and girls each typing in a poem,&quot; and asks: &quot;Isanybody controlling the quality of the text from a scholarlypoint of view?&quot;   Some librarians, too, have been cool to Gutenberg, arguingthat electronic text is reader-unfriendly and subject totampering. Yet Tom Abbott, who manages off-campus libraryservices for the statewide Community College of Maine, seesdata bases like Gutenberg's as the only solution to theinformation deluge: &quot;We're up to a couple of thousandoriginal books being published each day world-wide, and nolibrary can conceivably collect everything.&quot;   In describing the genesis of Project Gutenberg, Mr. Hartwaxes lyrical. It was 1971, he was a student at theUniversity of Illinois, and through computer-operatorfriends, gained access to its mainframe from midnight to 8a.m. &quot;The old computer rooms had an aura of mystery, churchand magic,&quot; he recalls. &quot;You were a computer god.&quot; But whatto do with all those millions of microseconds ticking away?Fishing around in his backpack, he found a copy of theDeclaration of Independence, began typing, and ProjectGutenberg was born.   He has kept it going on a shoestring ever since, wheedlingfree equipment and computer time, building his own hardware,and living frugally by choice. He doesn't own a car, andrides a bicycle hitched to a cart to tow computers. Recently,he abandoned his torn sweats for coat and tie, though hestill wears sneakers.   Though he has worked at Illinois Benedictine for twoyears, he hasn't yet presented a bill for his time. &quot;I willwhen I need the money,&quot; he says. Consulting work -- buildingcomputers or retrieving clients' lost data from damaged disks-- pays the bills. &quot;I live very low on the hog,&quot; he says.   One day, however, Mr. Hart intends to cash in. &quot;Ten yearsfrom now if I sent out a note asking for $10 from everybodywho has gotten books from Gutenberg,&quot; he says, &quot;I'd like tothink I'd have a big enough pile to go off and do somethingnew.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
