TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An elementary school principal who drafted hisown 11-point peace plan said Tuesday he canceled a trip to Egypt topromote the proposal because Israel barred him from meeting PLOofficials.   Assad Saftawi attracted attention with his plan calling for localPalestinians to negotiate an interim autonomy for the occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip.   The plan brought positive reactions from Israeli officials whosaid it indicated Palestinians from the occupied territories arewilling to start negotiations without the Palestine LiberationOrganization, which Israel designates a terrorist group.   The officials considered it a favorable response to PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir's proposal for elections in the occupiedlands to choose Palestinians to negotiate with Israel aboutself-rule. Talks on the final status would be left until later.   But Saftawi, headmaster of a school in the Gaza Strip's Bureijrefugee camp, told Israeli officials he needed PLO approval.   ``There is no way that my peace plan will be valid unless the PLOlooks at it and agrees on it,'' he said.   ``But the Israelis think that if they let me go and talk to thePLO they will recognize the PLO in a roundabout way.''   Saftawi, 54, said he is canceling his trip to Egypt since themain purpose was to meet PLO officials.   He met Monday with Shmuel Goren, Israel's coordinator for theoccupied territories, and conferred last month with Defense MinisterYitzhak Rabin.   The Rabin meeting was considered significant because of Saftawi'shistory as a pro-PLO activist convicted in 1973 for belonging toYasser Arafat's Fatah faction.   Fatah official Salah Khalaf was quoted Tuesday as criticizingSaftawi's plan. The Kuwait daily Al-Watan quoted Khalaf as saying:``I think we differ with this blueprint because we consider anyseparation between the elections and comprehensive solution to bedesigned to serve Israel's interests.''   An Israeli military official said Goren warned Saftawi he facedprosecution if he violated Israeli laws barring contacts with thePLO.   ``We told him that if he wants to go abroad, he can do it. ... Ifhe disobeys the law, however, he will have to take theconsequences,'' the official said on condition of anonymity.   ``Every Palestinian who asks for permission to meet with PLOofficials gets the same answer,'' he added.   Violators from the occupied territories can be sentenced to up to10 years in jail, said an army spokesman. Israeli violators can getup to three years in prison.   The attorney general's office said Tuesday it is investigatingthree Israeli legislators for meeting with Arafat. Those underinvestigation are Communist Party Members Meir Wilner and TawfikZiad and Abdel Wahab Darousha, an Israeli-Arab from the DemocraticArab Party.</TEXT></DOC>
