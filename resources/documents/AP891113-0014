Shultz,who stunned the Bush administration by announcing he supportslegalizing drugs, says he's treading an unpopular path that nopolitician wants to take, ``not for a minute.''   Many of the leading drug legalization advocates aren't ingovernment posts, but some public officials put their careers onthe line by taking the unpopular stance or by calling for a closelook at the legalization argument long before Shultz stepped intothe controversy.   Thus far, their ventures don't appear to have hurt their careers.   Shultz's pronouncement last month contends the war on drugs isfutile.   ``It seems to me we're not really going to get anywhere until wecan take the criminality out of the drug business and theincentives for criminality out of it,'' he said in a column in TheWall Street Journal, an adaptation of an earlier speech.   ``Frankly, the only way I can think of to accomplish this is tomake it possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated placeat a price that approximates their cost,'' he wrote. ``We need atleast to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization ofdrugs.''   The position drew hoots from White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater.   ``Whoa, he's been out on the West Coast too long, hasn't he? Theguy slips into retirement and right away he starts saying thingsthat are strange,'' Fitzwater said.   National drug control strategy director William J. Bennettcalled legalization ``a dopey idea'' and a ``moral disaster.''   Shultz acknowledged that he was ``shouting into the breeze hereas far as what we're doing now.''   ``No politician wants to say what I just said, not for aminute.''   The most prominent politician currently holding office who hasadvocated some form of legalization is Baltimore Mayor KurtSchmoke, a former prosecutor who wants to change ``attitudes aboutdrug addiction from a crime problem to a public health problem.''   But he's not alone.   Other public officials who have supported legalization, or atleast a civil and in-depth discussion of the possibility, includeHartford, Conn., Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry; Mercer County (N.J.)Executive Bill Mathesius; Columbia (Mo.) Deputy Chief of PoliceCarroll Highbarger; and New York State Sen. Joseph L. Galiber ofthe Bronx.   Their careers haven't collapsed.   Perry, who testified before Congress last year that she supportsSchmoke's views, was just re-elected by a 2-1 margin over herRepublican opponent.   Mathesius, a former federal and county prosecutor, was beingtouted as a possible state attorney general if Rep. James Courter,a Republican, had won the governorship. Courter, however, lost toDemocratic Rep. James J. Florio.   Mathesius, whose county includes Trenton and who next faces thevoters in 1991, said public reaction to his pro-legalization stance``has been running 20-1 in favor, among those who have taken thetime and trouble to write. I was surprised.''   Highbarger was chief of detectives in Columbia when he startedcalling for a study of legalization 1{ years ago. Since then, he'sbeen promoted to deputy chief of the department.   Some legalization advocates say San Jose (Calif.) Police ChiefJoseph McNamara is in their camp, but he denies it.   ``We've had 70 years of glorious failure and we really need tolook for different ways'' to deal with the drug problem, McNamarasaid several years ago. The focus, he said, should be divertedsomewhat from law enforcement to increased prevention and treatmentefforts to reduce demand.   ``I think it's a big jump from being critical to legalization,especially when there are no definitions of what form legalizationwill take,'' McNamara said in an interview.   Bennett and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh have said that lawenforcement alone can't solve the problem. Bush's drug strategyreflects those views in words, but McNamara noted that theappropriations request still devotes the biggest bucks to lawenforcement.   ``If this so-called war flops after three years, I think therewill be some massive changes in public policies ... and they'll beforced to be open to other ideas'' such as legalization, McNamarasaid.   Highbarger says the problem with drug prohibition is that``enforcement is simply not working.''   ``We're pouring money down a rathole,'' he said in an interview.``Drugs get cheaper every year. That tells you how good ourenforcement effort is.''   Highbarger joked that the latest anti-drug program in Columbia _a city of 70,000 in a metropolitan area of 125,000 where crack hasbeen the major problem _ is winter.   ``At 35 degrees and a 35 mph wind, it's harder to stand out onthe street corner selling drugs,'' he said, laughing. ``That's ourcurrent program, and it's working.''</TEXT></DOC>
