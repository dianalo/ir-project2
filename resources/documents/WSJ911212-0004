Keating Jr. will surrender todayto face federal criminal charges stemming from the collapseof Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association, his attorney said.   The lawyer, Stephen C. Neal, said that his client willturn himself in &quot;sometime in the morning, and there will be atwo o'clock bail hearing before a magistrate.&quot; Mr. Neal,reached in his Los Angeles office, said he will ask that Mr.Keating be allowed to remain free on bail pending trial.</LP><TEXT>   A federal grand jury indictment charging the formerAmerican Continental Corp. chairman and four formerassociates with bank fraud and other wrongdoing had beenexpected this week. It was understood that the other fourindividuals also would surrender today.   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office here, which hadconducted a two-year investigation into Mr. Keating'sbusiness affairs, declined to comment yesterday.   The charges against the former thrift operator are likelyto focus on reputedly fraudulent real estate transactionsthat the government contends were designed to drain Lincolnof funds and benefit American Continental, at the time itsPhoenix, Ariz., parent company. People close to theinvestigation have said that the allegations are likely to bewide-ranging.   If that is so, the federal government's case would markthe first time criminal charges going directly to the essenceof thrift-related crime have been brought against Mr.Keating. He was convicted last week by a California statecourt jury on 17 counts of securities fraud, but the chargesin that case concerned misstatements in the sale of AmericanContinental bonds and weren't aimed at any alleged unlawfulmanagement of the Sandamp;L's assets.   The full scope of the anticipated charges remained unclearyesterday. &quot;I haven't seen the indictment yet and theprosecutors haven't described it to me,&quot; said Mr. Neal.   The four former Keating associates also expected tosurrender are Judy Wischer, former American Continentalpresident; Andrew Liggett, its former chief financialofficer; Robert M. Wurzelbacher, Mr. Keating's son-in-law andformer American Continental senior vice president, andCharles H. Keating III, Mr. Keating's son and former companyexecutive vice president.   Lawyers for the four couldn't immediately be reached forcomment.</TEXT></DOC>
