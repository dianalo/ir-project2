Gonzalez, a 47-year-old former labor lawyer, has since led thecountry into an economic boom with policies that upset some of hisown Socialists, labor particularly.   He also has brought Spain into the European Economic Communityand reaffirmed its membership in the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization.   So far it has been a successful road for Gonzalez, who once hadto slip into Spain from France in the trunk of a car because hisparty was outlawed by the authoritarian regime of Gen. FranciscoFranco.   According to private and government polls, the Socialists areexpected to win at least 40 percent of the vote from the country's29.5 million registered voters for their third absolute majority inthe 350-seat lower house of Parliament. They now hold 183 seats.   Polls also indicate little on the right or left can block theSpanish Socialist Workers Party, the official name of Gonzalez'sparty.   The main opposition group, the conservative Popular Party, is indisarray, having struggled in the past two years for coherenceunder three different leaders.   Its current leader and candidate to replace Gonzalez is36-year-old Jose Maria Aznar. He took the reins of the party lessthan two months before Gonzalez, on Aug. 25, issued the call forthis election. The conservatives now hold 91 lower house seats andare campaigning on a platform calling for privatization of stateindustry, sharp cuts in public spending and lower taxes.   Former Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez of the Social DemocraticCenter Party is repeating his 1986 attempt to recapture the office,mainly with a call for the abolition of the 12-month obligatorymilitary service. His party now holds 28 seats in the lower house.   In 1977, two years after Franco's death, the 58-year-old Suarezformed Spain's first democratically elected government in 41 years.   The Socialists' response to Suarez on the military service issueis that they reduced the obligatory service time to the current 12from the 18 months that existed during his administration. TheSocialists also ask how Suarez plans to pay for an all-volunteerarmy.   The United Left coalition under Julio Anguita, the 48-year-oldCommunist and former mayor of Cordoba, is expected to gain up tofive seats more than its current seven by picking up the votes ofSocialists disillusioned with the Gonzalez government, which theyperceive as having shifted towards the center-right.   Their slogan, ``We Are the Alternative,'' is aimed at members ofthe General Workers Union, the country's largest and historicallySocialist labor movement. The union has not called on its rank andfile to vote Socialist this time, claiming that the Gonzalezgovernment has failed to promote an equitable distribution ofSpain's new wealth.   According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment, Spain's per capita gross domestic product rose from$4,192 in 1984 to $7,449 in 1987, the year after Spain joined theEEC and confirmed its membership NATO.   Its annual growth rate of 5 percent is Europe's highest.   In the 1982 campaign, when Gonzalez ran in his first successfulcampaign, his anti-NATO stance and populist style made Westernleaders nervous.   In this campaign, Gonzalez and other Socialist leaders maintainthat opposition parties have failed to come up with seriousplatforms and alternatives.   ``Their exaggerated negativism is a reflection of theirfrustration,'' Gonzalez has said. ``They would be better off ifthey tried to come up with alternatives that would appeal tovoters.''   Another issue that has upset the opposition is Gonzalez's wife,Carmen, who is running for Parliament on the Socialist ticket inCadiz.   Opposition parties have compared her to Eva Peron, who had anexceeding influential role in Argentina as the wife of populistdictator Juan D. Peron, and to Imelda Marcos, the wife of formerPresident Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines.   Gonzalez's only response to those who make the comparisons isthat they lack ``democratic sentiment.''</TEXT></DOC>
