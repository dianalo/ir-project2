Developed by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists, the test is based on evidence that cancer often develops in two stages. First, an &quot;initiator&quot; damages a cell's DNA, priming it to form a tumor. Later, a &quot;promoter&quot; causes further damage and triggers such cells to multiply out of control.    The main laboratory technique now used to screen cancer-causing substances detects only the initiators. The MIT test, however, identifies tumor promoters, such as dioxin, for which there are no widely accepted test-tube detectors, says Sheldon Penman, one of the MIT researchers. The test employs dog kidney cells to &quot;sniff&quot; out the compounds. When a trace amount of dioxin is put in a test tube with the dog kidney cells, they &quot;spread out, become flatter and start moving in a way that they never ordinarily do,&quot; says Mr. Penman.    He adds that the test has faultlessly identified more than a dozen known carcinogenic substances in experiments on its reliability. But he cautions that proving its value will require tests with hundreds of compounds, a process that he estimates would take two years.    Several companies have expressed interest in the test, which MIT recently patented, says Mr. Penman. Eventually, he adds, it may help in the rapid screening of water supplies, industrial products and other substances.    Water Vision   Computers may enable unmanned underwater vehicles to see better.    The aquatic robots, called ROVs, or remotely operated vehicles, are increasingly popular for making repairs on floating oil rigs, for exploring shipwrecks and for other underwater jobs. ROVs usually relay images of their surroundings to human operators via television, sonar and other instruments. But such images often aren't clear, and monitoring the multiple dials and screens involved is like playing several video games at once.    Ken Stewart, a student at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod, working with scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has developed a computerized system that combines data from several ROV sensing devices to display sharper images of underwater scenes on a single screen. &quot;I'm trying to take all of the information a human operator would get and merge it into a three-dimensional model of a scene,&quot; says Mr. Stewart.    The system, for example, might blend sonar data with a TV image to produce a sharper picture than possible with a camera alone. And unlike sonar and TV, the computerized system builds in its memory an image of an underwater scene and gradually sharpens it as more data is collected from sensing instruments.    Recently, Mr. Stewart used a prototype to make images of the U.S.S. Monitor, a sunken Civil War ship. Eventually, the system will simulate changing scenes around ROVs much as computerized flight simulators display changing landscapes for pilot trainees, he adds.    Ocean Energy   Robinson Crusoe could have used one -- a system that taps the ocean's energy to generate electricity and make fresh water.    The system is a variation on &quot;ocean thermal energy conversion,&quot; or OTEC -- an experimental power-generating technology considered attractive during the 1970s oil crisis but which lost favor afterward. Designed by scientists with Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago and the Solar Energy Research Institute in Golden, Colo., the new system is generating renewed interest in OTEC among island communities in tropical areas.    In a typical OTEC system, warm water near the surface of the ocean heats ammonia in a chamber at low pressure. The ammonia boils, making steam that drives an electric generator. Cold sea water drawn from half-a-mile down is used to condense the steam for recycling. OTEC systems' operating costs are nominal, but their building costs are higher than those of conventional alternatives.    The new variation on the idea may be more economically attractive because in addition to generating power, it distills fresh water from ocean water, via some fancy plumbing. A small prototype in Hawaii makes six gallons of drinking water a minute, says Anthony Thomas, an Argonne engineer. A scaled up version to produce electricity and water for a city of 20,000 might cost about $60 million, he adds.    &quot;The technological ingredients are there&quot; for such a system, he says. &quot;A lot of islands that need both water and power are looking very hard at this, but raising the money for it hasn't happened yet.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
