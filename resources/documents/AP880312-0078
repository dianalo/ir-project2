Reshat Dzhemilev, who was jailed for three years because he onceasked Saudi Arabia to aid the cause of his people, said Moscow'smove would affect only a small number of his people _ and onlythose who toe the Communist Party line.   ``It's a campaign to deceive the public, to create theappearance of action,'' Dzhemilev said in a telephone interview.   The Tatars were deported in 1944 from Crimea, a peninsula in theUkrainian republic that extends into the Black Sea.   A government official told a commission in the Central Asianrepublic of Uzbekistan on March 5 that Crimean Tatars who are ``themost virtuous and well-proven in work and social life'' would beallowed to return to Crimea, the newspaper Pravda Vostoka reported.   The newspaper, in its March 6 edition, said the State LaborCommittee would decide which Crimean Tatars are eligible forresettlement on the basis of recommendations from laborcollectives, and commissions of Crimean Tatars.   Dzhemilev said he did not believe the Crimean Tatars whoattended the commission meeting in the Uzbek capital of Tashkentfaithfully expressed the wishes of most of his people.   Pravda Vostok said the commission was made up of republic-levelrepresentatives of Crimean Tatars and that the meeting also wasattended by officials of regional commissions.   ``Two hundred families maybe will be allowed to move there, butthat will not solve the problem,'' said Dzhemilev, a leader in theCrimean Tatar effort who lives in Tashkent but spoke during a visitto Moscow. ``It's just supposed to distract attention.''   The newspaper indicated that the Crimean Tatars would be allowedto resettle ``as conditions are created'' primarily in stepperegions of the Crimea. It hinted that resettlement will be limitedin the areas on the Black Sea that have become popular resorts.   The Crimean Tatars, who number from 250,000 to 350,000, areamong the more than 100 national groups in the Soviet Union. Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said that ensuring national unitywhile granting ethnic groups cultural and linguistic rights is``the most vital, fundamental issue of our society.''   The Crimean Tatars have been fighting for the right to return totheir ancestral homeland ever since they were driven away. In May1944, soon after Soviet troops liberated the Crimea from NaziGermany, all the Crimean Tatars were charged with betraying theircountry and forcibly deported.   They were shipped in sealed freight cars to the eastern regionsof the Soviet Union, with most winding up in reservations inUzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenia and Kirgizia. Thousands diedduring deportation.   The war crimes charges leveled against them were dropped in 1967but the Tatars were not allowed to return permanently to the Crimea.   The Crimean Tatars stage demonstrations regularly to press theircause, the most recent being a rally March 5 outside a Moscowhotel. Police broke up the protest and detained 15 of the 20demonstrators, dissidents reported.   The government set up a national commission headed by PresidentAndrei A. Gromyko to consider the Crimean Tatars' demands, and onFeb. 3 it endorsed steps to promote the group's culture.
