The following summary also contains a listof submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appeal</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Eugene S. Post, 8/22/88, KFA-0203</T3>Eugene S. Post (Appellant) filed an Appeal from a denial by the AssistantManager for Administration, Cavannah River Operations Office of a Requestfor Information which he had submitted under the Freedom of InformationAct. In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that the material at issue_thenames and applications of unsuccessful applicants for two DOE positions,the names of the successful applicants on the applicant evaluation worksheets,and the DOE evaluator's names_were properly withheld under Exemptions 5and 6. However, the DOE ordered the Assistant Manager to indicate to theAppellant which of the scores on the worksheet were those of the successfulapplicants. The most important issue considered in the Decision and Orderinvolved the balancing of the public interest in releasing this materialwith the applicants' privacy interests.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Exception</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Le Paul Oil Company, 8/16/88, KEE-0160</T3>Le Paul Oil Company (Le Paul) filed a Statement of Objections to the ProposedDecision and Order (PDO) tentatively denying the firm's Application forException from the requirement to file Form EIA-782B, entitled, ``Resellers'/Retailers'Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering the firm's Objections,the DOE found that Le Paul provided cruicial information to the nationas a certainty firm and did not have a burden significantly different fromother reporting firms. Accordingly, the firm's application for exceptionrelief was denied.<ITAG tagnum="84">Refund Applications</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Aminoil U.S.A. Inc., MGU Development Company, 8/22/88, RF139-95</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by MGU Development Company. The firm is seeking funds made availableby Aminoil U.S.A., Inc., in a consent order with the Department of Energy.The procedures set forth to distribute the Aminoil funds contain a presumptionthat spot purchasers of Aminoil products were not injured by the allegedovercharges. Because MGU made only sporadic purchases from Aminoil, theDepartment requested that MGU rebut the spot purchaser presumption. Thefirm was unable to do so and, therefore, its claim was denied.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Aminoil U.S.A., Inc./Pennington LP Gas Company, 8/26/88, RF139-89</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by Pennington LP Gas Company (Pennington), a retailer/reseller ofpropane covered by a Consent Order that the DOE entered into with AminoilU.S.A., Inc. Pennington claimed that it was entitled to a refund in excessof the volumetric amount because it was disproportionately overchargedas a result of improper freight charges. We concluded that no refund abovethe volumetric level is warranted in this proceeding. Based on the documentationsubmitted by Pennington substantiating that during the consent order periodit maintained banks of unrecovered costs and purchase cost data that wascompared with publicly available industry pricing data, we determined thatPennington suffered significant injury and that a refund of the full volumetricamount is appropriate. The total refund approved in this Decision is $297,550,representing $169,009.22 in principal and $128,540.78 in accrued interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Dorchester Gas Corporation/Southwest Gas  Equipment  Co.  G.E.  Stahl,8/23/88, RF253-43, RF253-50</T3>Southwest Gas Equipment Co. and G.E. Stahl each filed an Application forRefund in the Dorchester Gas Corporation refund proceeding. Their submissionsestablished that they were regular purchasers of propane produced and suppliedby Dorchester during the consent order period. Although their volumetricrefund share exceeded $5,000, they elected to receive a refund under theadministrative presumption rule. The DOE therefore granted each of thema refund of $5,000 plus accrued interest without requiring a proof of injury.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Dorchester Gas Corporation/Turpin Oil Company, 8/26/88, RF253-443</T3>Turpin Oil Company filed an application for Refund in the Dorchester GasCorporation refund proceeding. Turpin purchased propane produced by Dorchesterfrom Phillips Petroleum Company during the consent order period. As anindirect purchaser, it is eligible for a refund to the extent that thedirect purchaser passed through the alleged overcharges to its customers.In a Decision and Order issued to Phillips, the DOE granted Phillips arefund equal to 20.4358 percent of its volumetric share. <T3>Dorchester Gas Corp./Phillips Petroleum Co.</T3>, 16 DOE 85,400 (1987).Thus, the remaining 79.5642 percent of Phillips volumetric share is availablefor distribution to its downstream purchasers. On this basis, the DOE grantedTurpin a refund of $3,823 plus interest, which equals its purchase volumemultiplied by the applicable percentage of its volumetric share.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Everett R. Kneeland, et al., 8/24/88, RF272-14363, et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying thirteen Applications for Refundfiled in connection with the Subpart V crude oil refund proceedings. Eachapplicant was either a reseller or retailer during the period August 19,1973 through January 27, 1981. Because none of the applicants demonstratedthat they were injured due to the crude oil overcharges, they were ineligiblefor a crude oil refund.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Fitts Farms, Inc., 8/26/88, RF272-12570</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order in which it determined that Fitts Farms,Inc. had inadvertently been granted two refunds in the Subpart V CrudeOil refund proceedings. Accordingly, the DOE rescinded the refund grantedto Fitts Farm in <T3>Kenneth D. Sheru,</T3> 17 DOE andpara; 85,705 (1988), and ordered theController's Office of the DOE not to distribute Fitts Farms' refund.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Getty  Oil  Company/Garvin  J.  Sloan, 8/22/88, RF 265-1963</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by a firm that operated as a consignee agent of Getty motor gasolineduring the consent order period. We determined that the applicant demonstratedthat it experienced a decline in its market share for motor gasoline andwas, therefore, injured as a result of Getty's uncompetitive prices. Thetotal refund approved in this Decision is $10,279 representing $5,019 inprincipal and $5,260 in accrued interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Getty Oil Company/Lawrence E. Collier, 8/22/88, RF265-2716</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by a firm that operated as a consignee agent of Getty motor gasolineduring the consent order period. We determined that the applicant demonstratedthat it experienced a decline in its market share for motor gasoline andwas, therefore, injured as a result of Getty's uncompetitive prices. Thetotal refund approved in this Decision is $2,277, representing $1,112 inprincipal and $1,165 in accrued interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Getty Oil Company Truckers Inn, Inc., Seward Propane, 8/25/88, RF265-2725,RF265-2726, RF265-2742</T3>Truckers Inn, Inc. and Seward Propane Company filed Applications for Refundin which the applicants sought a portion of the fund obtained by the DOEthrough a Consent Order entered into with Getty Oil Company. The applicantssubmitted information indicating the volumes of Getty gasoline, middledistillate or propane purchased during the consent order period. Utilizingthe procedures outlined in <T3>Getty Oil Corp</T3>., 15 DOE andpara; 85,064 (1968), the applicants electedto use the presumptive levels of injury, forty percent for gasoline, fiftypercent for middle distillate and sixty percent for propane. The totalamount of the refund approved in the Decision and Order is $42,943.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Getty Oil Company/Weiler Oil Company, 8/23/88, RF265-0930, RF265-0931</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning two Applications for Refundfiled by a firm that operated as a consignee agent of Getty motor gasolineduring the consent order period. We determined that the applicant demonstratedthat it experienced a decline in its market share for motor gasoline/middledistillates and was, therefore, injured as a result of Getty's uncompetitiveprices. The total refund approved in this Decision is $1,126, representing$550 in principal and $576 in accrued interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Gulf Oil Corporation/Birmingham Auto Service, 8/22/88, RF40-279</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by Birmingham Auto Service. The firm is seeking funds made availableby Gulf Oil Corporation in a consent order with the Department of Energy.The procedures set forth to distribute the Gulf funds state that an applicantmust certify that it would not have been required to pass through to itscustomers a cost reduction equal to that of the refund requested. The firmhas made this certification and has provided a monthly purchase volumeschedule in support of its claim of less than $5,000 in principal. Afterreviewing the application and supporting data, the DOE has concluded thatBirmingham should receive a refund of $1,386, representing $1,064 in principaland $322 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Jack Griggs, Inc., et al</T3>., <T3>8/25/88, RF272-27828, et al</T3>.DOE issued a Decision and Order and denying twelve Applications for Refundfiled in connection with the Subpart V crude oil refund proceedings. Eachapplicant was either a reseller or a retailer during the period August19, 1973 through January 27, 1981. Because none of the applicants demonstratedthat they were injured due to the crude oil overcharges, they were ineligiblefor a crude oil refund.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mack-Miller Candle Co., Inc</T3>., <T3>8/26/88</T3>, RF272-12571The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a refund from crude oil overchargefunds to Mack-Miller Candle Co., Inc. based on its purchases of residualfuel oil and paraffin during the period August 19, 1973 through January27, 1981. Mack-Miller used the products in its manufacturing of ecclesiasticalcandles. The DOE found that the applicant had provided sufficient evidenceof the volume of refined petroleum products that it purchased during theperiod August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981. The DOE also found thatparaffin is an eligible product upon which a crude oil refund claim maybe based. As an end-user of petroleum products, the applicant was presumedto have been injured as a result of the crude oil overcharges. The refundgranted was $533.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Marathon Petroleum Co./Bassett Oil andamp; Equipment Co., 8/23/88, RF250-2454,RF250-2455</T3>Bassett Oil and Equipment Company filed an Application for Refund in theMarathon Petroleum Co. refund proceeding. During the Marathon consent orderperiod, Bassett purchased and resold gasoline supplied by Marathon. TheDOE found Bassett sustained competitive disadvantage as a result of Marathon'salleged overcharges. On the basis of the claimant's purchase volume, theDOE granted Bassett a refund of $7,936 plus $1,190 accured interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Marathon Petroleum Co./Brink's Incorporated, 8/26/88, RF250-2746</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by Brink's, Incorporated, an end-user of motor gasoline covered bya consent order that the DOE entered into with Marathon Petroleum Company.The Applicant's claim was estimated and based, in part, on indirect purchases.The DOE found the Applicant's estimation method to be reasonable and, sincenone of the applicant's indirect purchases came from firm that demonstratedthe specific extent of its own injury, the DOE included the indirect purchasesin the Applicant's allocable share. As an end-user, the Applicant was presumedinjured by Marathon's alleged overcharges. The refund approved in thisDecision is $274 in principal and $50 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Marathon Petroleum Co./Savings Oil Co., 8/25/88, RF250-2, RF250-3</T3>Savings Oil Company filed a Motion for Reconsideration of a Decision andOrder that the OHA issued on January 29, 1988. In that Decision, the DOEfound that the firm had a negative cost bank at the end of 1979, indicatingthat it was able to recover all of the product purchase costs incurredprior to January 1, 1980. The DOE therefore limited refunds to Savingsto the products that the firm purcahsed from Marathon after December 31,1979. In its Motion for Reconsideration, Savings stated that it erroneouslyfailed to accumulate its unrecouped product costs on a quarterly basis.It corrected the error and established that it had a cumulative bankedcosts at the end of each quarter greater than its refund claim. The firmalso established that it sustained competitive injury as a result of Marathon'salleged overcharges. The DOE therefore granted Savings a refund of $13,652plus interest, which, when added to the amount of refund granted in theJanuary 19, 1988 Decision, is equal to the firm's volumetric share in theMarathon refund pool.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Marathon Petroleum Company/W.E. Jersey andamp; Sons, Inc., 8/23/88, RF250-1286</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refundfiled by a purchaser of products covered by a consent order that the agencyentered into with Marathon Petroleum Company. The Applicant purchased someproduct directly from Marathon, but purchased the remainder from FlemingBrothers Oil Company. The DOE determined that the Applicant's indirectpurchases should be considered under the standards for direct purchasesbecause Fleming never demonstrated a specific level of overcharge absorption.The Applicant's total refund request was smaller than the $5,000 smallclaims refund amount. The refund approved in this Decision is $430 in principaland $78 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp., C.L. Wellington, Inc., Ridgeway Petroleum, Inc., 8/26/88,RF225-9618, RF225-9619, RF225-9620, RF225-9621, RF225-11046, RF225-9729,RF225-9730, RF225-9731</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting Applications for Refund filedby C.L. Wellington, Inc. and Ridgeway Petroleum, Inc. in the Mobil OilCorp. special refund proceeding. <T3>Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985). Each applicant attemptedto rebut the level-of-distribution presumptions for its purchases of Mobilmotor gasoline. In support of its claim, each applicant submitted costbanks that it approximated from firm-wide annual revenue data. The DOEconcluded that such cost banks were an inadequate basis for rebutting thelevel-of-distribution presumptions. In the Mobil proceeding, however, anapplicant that fails in its attempt to rebut the level-of-distributionpresumptions is still eligible for refund under them. Accordingly, C.L.Wellington was granted a refund of $4,574, representing $3,663 in principal$911 in interest, and Ridgeway Petroleum was granted a refund of $9,409,representing $7,535 in principal and $1,874 in interest. The total amountof refunds approved in the Decision was $13,983, representing $11,198 inprincipal and $2,785 in interest.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./John's Mobil, Chan Hi Kim, 8/24/88, RF225-4518, RF225-4519,RF225-4869</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order in the Mobil Oil Corp. special refundproceeding concerning two applications filed by John's Mobil (John's) andChan Hi Kim (Kim). Both applicants filed incomplete refund applicationsin the Mobil proceeding. DOE made numerous requests for additional informationfrom both firms, but neither responded. Because John's and Kim failed tosubmit information required by the Mobil refund procedures, the two applicationswere denied. <T3>Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985).<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./Koch Refining Company, Commonwealth Propane Company,8/23/88, RF225-7030, RF225-7031, RF225-10002</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order in the Mobil Oil Corp. special refundproceeding concerning two refund applications filed by Koch Refining Company(Koch) and Commonwealth Propane Company (Commonwealth). Both applicantssubmitted purchase volume schedules showing sporadic and varied purchases.DOE tentatively concluded that both firms had purchased on the spot marketand requested documentation from each to rebut the spot purchaser presumption.Neither firm was able to submit the necessary documentation. Accordingly,both claims were denied. <T3>Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara;85,339 (1985).<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Mobil Oil Corp./St. Louis Fuel andamp; Supply Co., 8/22/88. RF225-10145</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order in the Mobil Oil Corp. special refundproceeding concerning a refund applications filed by St Louis Fuel andamp;Supply Co., Inc., (St. Louis), a reseller of Mobil middle distillates duringthe Mobil consent order period. St Louis' claim exceeded the $5,000 smallclaims presumption of injury level. Rather than submit documentation todemonstrate injury. St. Louis elected to limit its claim to $5,000. TheDOE found that St. Louis was eligible to receive a total refund of $6,244($5,000 in principal plus $1,244 in interest) in accordance with the proceduresoutlined in <T3>Mobil Oil Corp.,</T3> 13 DOE andpara;85,339 (1985).<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>National Car Rental, the Hertz Corp., Ryder Truck Rental, Inc., 8/25/88,RF272-15443, RF272-42811, RF272-73139</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying three applications refund filedin connection with Subpart V crude oil refund proceedings. Each Applicantwas a car rental and/or leasing agency during the period August 19, 1973through January 27, 1981. The Applicants were considered resellers forthe purposes of the crude oil Subpart V refund proceedings. Because noneof the Applicants demonstrated that they were injured due to crude oilovercharges, they were ineligible for a crude oil refund.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Northern Service Centers Corp., et al., 8/23/88, RF272-43276, et al.</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying eight Applications for Refundfiled in connection with Supart V crude oil refund proceedings. Each Applicantwas a reseller or retailer during the period August 19, 1973 through January27, 1981. Because none of the applicants demonstrated that they were injureddue to the crude oil overcharges, they were ineligible for a crude oilrefund.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Royal Crown of Angelo, Inc., et al., Coca-Cola Bottling Company ofLos Angeles, Mid-South Bottling Company, 8/25/88, RF272-162, et al., RF272-288RF272-329</T3>Seventeen domestic bottling companies filed Applications for Refund, basedupon their purchases of a refined petroleum products during the periodAugust 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981. The Applicants requested refundsfrom the crude oil monies currently available for disbursement by the Officeof Hearings and Appeals (OHA) pursuant to OHA's authority under 10 CFRPart 205, Subpart V. On October 15, 1987, a group of thirty States andtwo Territories of the United States (collectively ``the States'') filedconsolidated States' Objections and Motions for Discovery in two of therefund proceedings, involving Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angles (CCLA)and Mid-South Bottling Co. (Mid-South), in which the States opposed thereceipt of any refund by those two firms and sought discovery of informationin support of their opposition. In considering the Applications of thebottlers and the States' Objections and Motions for Discovery, the DOEdetermined that: (1) The seventeen bottlers were presumptively entitledto refunds as industrial and end-users of petroleum products outside ofthe petroleum industry and each applicant had certified the volume of petroleumproducts which it purchased during the price control period; (2) the stateshad failed to rebut the presumption of eligibility on the basis of theStates' Objections with regard to CCLA and Mid-South; and (3) the Stateshad failed to show that discovery with regard to the CCLA and Mid-SouthApplications was appropriate or that any additional information shouldbe required of those firms. Accordingly, the Applications for Refund ofthe seventeen bottlers were granted, and the States' Objections and Motionsfor Discovery were dismissed.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Schlegel Tennessee, Inc., 8/26/88, RF272-7751</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and order granting a refund from crude oil overchargefunds to Schlegal Tennessee, Inc., a producer and supplier of rubber weatherstripping for autombiles. The DOE found that the applicant had providedsufficient evidence of the volume of refined petroleum products that itpurchased during the period August 19, 1973, through January 27, 1981.The DOE also found that ``process oil'', a thin oil which is mixed withpolymer and carbon black to form synthetic rubber, and ``dust stop oil'',a lubricant and cleaning agent used in rubber mills, are eligible productsupon which a crude oil refund claim may be based. However, the DOE determinedthat ``polymer' is not an eligible product since it is not directly refinedfrom crude oil. Schlegel was determined to be an end-user of the productsinvolved and was, therefore, found injured based upon the end-user presumptionof injury. The refund granted in this Decision is $555.<ITAG tagnum="84">Crude Oil End-Users</ITAG>The Office of Hearings and Appeals granted crude oil overcharge refundsto end-user applicants in the following Decisions and Orders:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,tp0,i1,s220,xls56,8,7,7</C> <H1>Name</H1><H1>Case No.</H1><H1>Date</H1><H1>Number of applicants</H1><H1>Total refund</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">A.A.
