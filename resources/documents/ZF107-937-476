Laboratory in Toronto developed twoof the CIM products, the Open Systems Interconnection/Manufacturing MessagingServices for OS/2 and VM environments, and the Realtime Plant ManagementIntegrated System that monitors and controls plant systems specifically inthe process industries.andM;DEC demonstrated new data management tools.andP;  Included were concurrentengineering, integrated engineering/manufacturing, and expert systems, aswell as the Vax DEC/MAP 3.0 industrial networking products.andM;Hewlett-Packard made a splash with new X Window-based graphics terminals thatwere developed, and will be manufactured, supported and marketed worldwidefrom Hewlett-Packard (Canada) Ltd.'s Panacom Automation Division based inWaterloo, Ont.andP;  The HP 700/X family consists of a comprehensive set ofnetwork-based graphics terminals based on MIT's X Window System.andM;Silicon Graphics Inc. announced VideoCreator, an integrated video outputsolution that allows users to record computer-generated images from Iris 4Dworkstations directly onto standard video tape and disk recorders.andM;Unisys CAD/CAM Inc., announced the immediate availability of its GeometricModeling Software 2.4 on the Sun SPARCstation, as well as a marketingassociate agreement with Intercim Corp.andP;  Under the agreement, Intercim willlicense its Factory Data Manager to Unisys customers.andM;John White, president of Texas Instruments Information Technology Group,perhaps best summarized the mode of the computer firms when he urgedmanufacturing and processing industries worldwide to &quot;harness the power&quot; ofinformation technology and automation.andM;&quot;As the 1990s unfold, early exploitation of new, intelligent automation andinformation technologies will become more and more decisive in themanufacturing competitiveness of both domestic and global companies,&quot; hesaid.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
