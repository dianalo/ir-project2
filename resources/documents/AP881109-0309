The original so-called ``Brain'' computer virus was traced to acomputer store in Lahore, Pakistan.   ``It probably hasn't cost us much except a few days ofpeople-time to clean up these disks, but it probably cost thestudents a good bit of frustration,'' said Michael Walters, directorof research and instructional computing services at the university'smain campus.   Some students have reported losing data, but Walters said heknows of no one who has lost an entire term paper or other largequantity of work. Reports of the virus were still coming in fromstudents late Tuesday.   The virus first announced itself at the university early lastweek on the screen of one of the 150 personal computers the businessdepartment has for students and faculty, Walters said. It has notspread to larger computers at the school, he said.   A computer virus is a string of coded commands hidden in usefulprograms or software. Like a biological virus, it uses its host toreproduce, replicating itself into other programs used on the samecomputer or into computers to which it is connected.   Since the affected university computers were isolated from eachother and the outside world, the virus' spread was limited, Walterssaid. Last week, a sophisticated virus spread along a computernetwork used by universities and defense contractors and eventuallyaffected an estimated 6,000 computers nationwide.   A virus can do damage in several ways: by keeping a computer sobusy with commands so that its operation becomes sluggish, ashappened with last week's virus; by using up memory; or by erasingdata.   Walters said the virus at the Houston school flashed thismessage, with misspellings, to students who tried to use infectedprograms: ``Welcome to the dungeon. Copyright 1968 Brain andamp; Amjads,PVT, LTD. Virus shoe record V9.0. Dedicated to the dynamic memory ofmillions of virus who are no longer with us today _ Thank Goodness.BEWARE OF THE VIRUS. This program is catching. Program follows afterthese messeges.''   The original ``Brain'' virus appeared in May at colleges andbusinesses along the East Coast. It flashed the ``Welcome to theDungeon'' message, but added ``Contact us for vaccination,'' andgave the names, address and phone number of two brothers who run acomputer store in Lahore, Pakistan.   Walters said the Houston version of the virus says nothing aboutany vaccine, and the ``V9.0'' in its message suggests it may be amodified version.</TEXT></DOC>
