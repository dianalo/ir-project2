Douglas Hunt, of the National Institute of Standards andTechnology, said that ``I think the review activity is moving verywell. We're very optimistic.''   Hunt said scrutiny of the plans, being carried out by a jointteam of specialists from the institute and the Pentagon's NationalSecurity Agency, had started Tuesday.   ``We're still receiving some plans. Most of them have come in _most of the agencies have sent their submissions. And we areproceeding with the review,'' he said.   Hunt said he did not yet have a count of the specific number ofcomputer security plans submitted so far, but said it was ``in thethousands.''   Drafting, review and implementation of new security plans forcomputers handling sensitive but unclassified data were among steps_ including improved training programs for computer users _ mandatedunder the Computer Security Act signed into law last year byPresident Reagan.   The legislation came in the wake of increased concern overvulnerability of government computer systems to so-called computerviruses and other threats.   In a report released last September, the General AccountingOffice, an arm of Congress, said federal agencies at that time hadidentified 53,443 computer systems _ an estimated 52,000 of themwithin the Defense Department _ containing sensitive data.   However, Hunt said he did not expect the number of security planssubmitted for review to reach that high because agencies are beingpermitted to group together similar computer systems under a singleplan.   He said the team reviewing the plans now includes 16 specialistsand was expected to peak this spring at about 30 people. Theinstitute is spending about $1.5 million on the effort, he said.   ``We are planning on completing the review at the latest by theend of May. Then we will be wrapping up with a final report,summaries and stuff in June,'' Hunt said.</TEXT></DOC>
