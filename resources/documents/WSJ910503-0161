The bill would allow judges to dismiss RICO lawsuitsbefore they come to trial if they don't involve &quot;egregiouscriminal conduct.&quot; Approved unanimously by the Houseintellectual property and judicial administrationsubcommittee, the legislation is virtually identical to ameasure that cleared the House Judiciary committee last fall.That bill never came to a floor vote in the House.</LP><TEXT>   Congress for several years has been attempting to alterRICO, which allows litigants to receive triple damages fromorganizations shown to engage in a pattern of illegalactivity. Many businesses have been sued under RICO duringthe past decade, prompting them to argue the law should beamended so it can be used only against groups connected toorganized crime.   But all previous attempts to change RICO have failed inthe face of opposition from prosecutors, citizen advocacygroups, and others who claim that RICO is a useful deterrentagainst white-collar crime.   The Bush administration was neutral on last year's bill,but there are signs it now is lining up against this year'sversion, at least as it is currently written. The JusticeDepartment recently voiced concern that the new measure mightpose an obstacle to suits brought by the federal governmentand asked to be exempted from the bill's proposed&quot;gatekeeper&quot; test. In addition, the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp. said the new bill might increase its costs in bankfraud cases.   Rep. Bill Hughes (D., N.J.), who heads the subcommitteeand sponsored the bill, said RICO is a &quot;formidable andeffective tool for law enforcement&quot; but in its present formrisks being ruled unconstitutional in court.   But Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.) said the proposedgatekeeper provision is so vague that it could become the&quot;subject of litigation for the next several years.&quot; He saidhe would offer a substitute to the bill when it reaches theJudiciary committee spelling out specific types of lawsuitsto be excluded from RICO lawsuits.   No RICO legislation has been introduced in the Senate thisyear. A spokesman for Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), whosponsored a previous RICO bill, said the senator is unlikelyto pursue the matter because its chances of clearing Congressare &quot;even worse&quot; this year than last year.</TEXT></DOC>
