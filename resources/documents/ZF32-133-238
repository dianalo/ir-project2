ShererandM;Operating environment vendors GeoWorks Inc. and Quarterdeck Office Systemsare negotiating a way to combine their technologies, officials at bothcompanies confirmed.andM;The two sides have met to discuss how GeoWorks' PC/GEOS can use Quarterdeck'sDesqview technology for multitasking DOS applications.andP;  PC/GEOS, a graphicalenvironment, can multitask specially written PC/GEOS applications, but canrun only one DOS application at a time.andP;  PC/GEOS is sold as GeoWorksEnsemble, a set of integrated applications.andM;&quot;They provide the capability to multitask multiple DOS applications, andwe're bringing in a new graphical environment,&quot; said Brian Dougherty, CEO ofGeoWorks, in Berkeley, Calif.andP;  &quot;It's a natural fit for us to support theirtechnology and let people multitask their DOS applications.&quot;andM;Quarterdeck is interested in helping GeoWorks use Desqview applicationprogramming interface (API) calls, which would enable multiple DOSapplications to be launched from within GeoWorks Ensemble if the user alsohas a copy of Desqview, said Gary Saxer, Quarterdeck's vice president oftechnical services, in Santa Monica, Calif.andM;&quot;I've told them it's possible that they could use features built intoDesqview now to launch multiple andlsqb;DOSandrsqb; applications and control thoseapplications from GeoWorks itself,&quot; he said.andM;However, Saxer downplayed the possibility of building the Desqviewenvironment itself, rather than just the API calls, into GeoWorks Ensemble.andO;&quot;It doesn't require any special relationship with Quarterdeck,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Inour company, you first work on the technical details.andP;  If the technicaldetails work out right, then you start talking about the price and themarketing.&quot;andM;GeoWorks is also moving ahead on short-term projects.andP;  This month, thecompany plans to release GeoWorks Ensemble 1.2, Dougherty said.andM;The upgrade, which automatically will be sent free to registered users, willinclude drivers for PostScript printers, a spelling checker, the ability tocopy and print over a network, and international time, date and monetaryformats.andM;Dougherty also confirmed that GeoWorks is building a spreadsheet intoGeoWorks Ensemble 2.0, which the firm plans to ship later this year.andP;  The newversion will include Back andamp; Forth, a DOS task switcher from ProgressiveSolutions Inc.andP;  This technology will let Ensemble users cut and paste text aswell as switch between GeoWorks and multiple DOS applications, but theapplications will not continue processing in the background.andM;GeoWorks, a private firm funded by venture capital, can be reached at (415)644-0883.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
