The president feels vindicated, advisers say. The rise in public support for Contra aid, apparently inspired by North's remarks, &quot;was an unexpected silver lining to this incredible cloud,&quot; says a person close to the first family. White House officials feel they also can now turn full attention to the Bork nomination fight, arms-control efforts and budget issues.    Aides consider plans for Reagan to speak out on Iran-Contra issues in speeches and press conferences, but he may wait until the hearings end. Splits remain over how far to go in the Contra-aid drive and in responding to the hearings. Conservatives complain Chief of Staff Baker and his aides haven't been tough enough on either matter.    The White House still faces embarrassing questions about why Reagan knew so little, plus testimony by Meese, Shultz and other top officials.    SLUGGISH GROWTH remains the byword for the economy.    The second-quarter growth rate, to be reported next week, will be less than half the 4.8% first-quarter rate, an administration economist predicts. Many private economists are even more bearish. Consumer spending, business investment and housing remain weak. Most economists expect the economy to continue to plod along.    Fed member Wayne Angell insists that economic growth is &quot;doing pretty well.&quot; But White House chief economist Beryl Sprinkel worries that the Fed may keep money growth too low. Martha Seger, the lone Fed member to push a looser policy at the central bank's May meeting, apparently agrees. &quot;What I said in May looks pretty good today,&quot; she says.    UNEASY ALLIANCE: Strains grow between NATO nations.    The U.S. and many Europeans oppose Canada's plans to end its commitment to send troops to Norway in a crisis. West Germany continues to differ with the U.S. on the the use of short-range missile systems. One reason for such strains, a Pentagon NATO specialist argues, is &quot;the administration isn't being as forceful as it should be in the alliance.&quot;    U.S. basing accords that expire in 1988 are jeopardized along NATO's southern flank. Spain wants U.S. fighter jets out of a base near Madrid. Turkey, riled by a 40% cut in U.S. aid, suspends ratification of a new base pact. Greek leader Papandreou repeatedly has threatened to end the U.S. basing agreement there.    One positive for the U.S.: Other NATO countries may be spurred to spend more money on defense.    GLASS HOUSE? Reagan administration foreign-policy strategists were incredulous when Oliver North assailed Congress for leaks. They say he was renowned for selective leaking of information that might help his causes. &quot;Ollie,&quot; says one top national-security official, &quot;was the biggest leaker in this administration.&quot;    MEESE FIRES BACK at critics. His aides mail fact sheets to editors disputing some of North's testimony about the attorney general's role in the Iran-Contra affair. Meese and congressional supporters also label charges about his handling of personal finances as partisan. But even some Reaganites complain about Meese's slowness in finding a new FBI chief.    BUSH CONDEMNS alleged efforts to set up a self-standing covert organization outside the laws governing the CIA. North testified that the late CIA chief Casey supported such a move. Bush says he wouldn't have condoned such action when he was the agency's director: &quot;I wouldn't want to be part of that.&quot;    ONE ON ONE: Dukakis and Gephardt agree to debate trade and economic issues in an Iowa forum this summer. The two increasingly see themselves as the prime rivals for the Democratic nomination. Gephardt strategists want to take the gloss off the Dukakis campaign; Dukakis will try to paint Gephardt policies as protectionist.    BIDEN'S BID shows gains, but critical campaign tests loom.    He moves up to the middle of the Democratic presidential pack in a national poll, builds support among Iowa activists and raises a hefty $3.2 million so far. But slow progress in New Hampshire sparks a staff shake-up there. And he fails to dazzle in joint appearances. &quot;Joe's reputation as a dynamic speaker built up expectations so much that he had to excel; he didn't,&quot; one Biden backer laments.    Advisers fret that the fight over the Bork nomination will &quot;completely overwhelm&quot; Biden's campaign and steal time from money-raising. Biden's preparation to preside over the September confirmation hearing will limit his campaigning to weekends. He will try to make a splash by laying out the case against Bork in Senate speeches, probably next week.    Pollster Pat Caddell reemerges as the top Biden campaign decision-maker. His strategies win praise, but his abrasiveness antagonizes many supporters.    MINOR MEMOS: Covert campaign? North talks privately to friends about running for president. A T-shirt seen at the Iran-Contra hearings proclaims, &quot;I'm a 'North' American.&quot; . . . Anti-Bork statements by liberals are dubbed &quot;Bork chops.&quot; . . . To get Congress's attention, corn growers send lawmakers a pro-sugar-import-quota plea printed on 2-by-4 boards. </TEXT></DOC>
