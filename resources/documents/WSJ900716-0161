Cattle bawl, ropes twirl,cowboys yip and hoot.   Suddenly, a giant tour bus lumbers into this cowboy idyll.The bus pulls up to the corral and stops with a loud hiss ofair brakes. Eleven Japanese men in business suits file offand furiously begin snapping pictures. The cowboys strikeposes. They're used to this drill. After all, these guys mayact like tourists, but they're the real bosses of the Lazy 8.</LP><TEXT>   Or, at least, that's been the case since Zenchiku Ltd.,Japan's largest beef purveyor, bought the 77,000-acre spreadtwo years ago. The visitors are mostly senior officers fromJapanese banks and pension funds -- &quot;big investors&quot; inZenchiku, says John Morse, 49, who runs the ranch.   As the businessmen step gingerly around cow pies, Mr.Morse bustles about, lining up his cowhands for the camerasand extolling the ranch's assets through an interpreter. Theguests grin and bow. But from the back of the pack comes amutter, in perfect English, &quot;This ought to be good. We surepaid top dollar to get it.&quot;   Indeed they did. But for $12.6 million, Zenchiku got aboothold deep in the heart of the Old West. Just down theroad lies Bannock, once the capital of the Montana Territory.Virginia City, fabled ghost town, lies a rifle shot further.   Given the Japanese fascination with almost anything havingto do with cowboys, it was probably only a matter of timebefore they showed up here. Zenchiku's purchase of the Lazy 8set off a stampede by Japanese investors, who have spentnearly $100 million on beef-processing facilities in the U.S.Now hardly a week goes by, says John Barrows, publisher ofthe Dillon Tribune, when rumors don't fly that some Japanesebuyer has picked up another feedlot or packing house.Zenchiku is one of the few to have tried ranching, though.   With Japan getting ready to dismantle its rigid quotas onbeef imports next spring, that nation's food giants sense abonanza on the range. Historically, Japan's 120 millionconsumers have spurned red meat; the average Japanese eatssix times as much fish as beef. But the Japanese arebeginning to develop a healthy appetite for hamburgers andsteaks.   Zenchiku's experiment here has drawn intense interest, notjust from big U.S. and Japanese food companies but also fromfolks here in Beaverhead County (population 8,000 people,90,000 cattle). &quot;People are wondering whether we're going tobe the Honda of the livestock industry,&quot; says Mr. Morse.   Not Honda, exactly, but the Lazy 8 is no Ponderosa,either. Just inside the ranchhouse door a row of slippers isneatly laid out for the visitors from Japan. Mr. Morse ushershis guests into the sprawling living room, which sportsWestern and Oriental art and a 60-mile view of the BitterrootMountains. The bar dispenses Japanese beer and saki. AJapanese garden just outside the front door is raked daily.   Kazuhiru Soma, a 26-year-old Zenchiku marketing trainee,mingles with the visitors, speaking Japanese. Zenchiku senthim and a co-worker here to learn the cowboy trade from theground up -- literally, as it turned out. Mr. Soma, who has ablack belt in karate, says the first time he went to wrestlea calf to the ground to be branded, he tried judo. &quot;I figuredit works on people, why not cows?&quot; Mr. Soma ended up in thedirt. The calf scampered away.   To win the two-year assignment, Mr. Soma had to write anessay for his corporate superiors explaining why he wanted togo to Montana. He'd grown up in a Tokyo suburb and hadn'tridden a horse until he arrived here, so he based his essayon Westerns he watched as a youngster.   In his new Stetson, scuffed boots and saucer-size beltbuckle, Mr. Soma certainly looks the part of the cowboy. Hedrives a shiny Ford Bronco with a bumper sticker that says&quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; -- in Japanese. But old habits die hard.When he makes a new acquaintance, he whips out a businesscard from a jeans pocket.   Mr. Soma and Tommy Fukutomi, Zenchiku's other importedcowboy, call Mr. Morse &quot;Sacho&quot; -- sort of the Japaneseequivalent of &quot;Top Dog.&quot; When they are finished talking tohim, they bow and back out of the room. &quot;It's the Japaneseway of showing respect,&quot; Mr. Morse says.   Zenchiku has replaced the traditional ranch hierarchy,where orders flowed from the ranch house to the bunk house,with Japanese-style consensus management. Each week, the Lazy8 cowpunchers mosey into a barn for what Mr. Morse calls &quot;anopen forum discussion.&quot; The cowboys talk about &quot;calvinggoals&quot; and &quot;fundamental principles&quot; with Ed Fryer, theranch's 39-year-old foreman.   &quot;We try to combine everybody's experience to reach ourgoals,&quot; says Mr. Fryer, a tall, lean man in faded Levis, whosounds somewhat more like a manager of a Toyota plant than acow boss.   Some of the changes have drawn a cool reception from thehands. When Zenchiku decided each of the ranch's 2,800 headof cattle had to sport an ear tag with its computer IDnumber, the cowboys balked. &quot;The men had practical problemsfrom a workload standpoint,&quot; Mr. Fryer explains.   Management and cowhands eventually talked things out. Butthe new emphasis on togetherness may have spooked somecowboys, traditionally loners. About half the ranch's workforce has departed since Zenchiku's arrival. The rest, saysMr. Fryer, &quot;seem to have evolved to our style of doingthings.&quot;   Zenchiku has triggered some local xenophobia. When thecompany bought the Lazy 8, the Tribune ran a letter from anangry woman accusing the company of &quot;taking over our ranchingbusiness.&quot; Mr. Barrows's predecessor published a cartoonshowing a pair of cows with Japanese flags branded on theirrumps asking if they had to moo in Japanese. &quot;There are justtoo many World War II memories hanging around for some peopleto be comfortable about this,&quot; says Sonja Williams, curatorof the Beaverhead County Museum.   Mr. Morse sought to defuse local hostility by deliveringan &quot;annual report&quot; on the ranch last fall at Western MontanaState College here. About 130 people showed up, more thanturned out for the governor on his last visit. Zenchiku isalso careful to buy local, including about $200,000 in farmmachinery from a Dillon tractor dealer. &quot;People keep score,&quot;Mr. Morse says.   In any event, Zenchiku seems to be on target with itsmajor goals -- better productivity and raising a strain ofbeef that will tickle the Japanese palate. The company feedsits cattle a special mixture of barley, corn and sorghum inan effort to achieve redder meat with bright, white fat.Japanese consumers think the yellow-tinged fat generallyfound in U.S. beef smells bad when cooked, Mr. Morse says.Each animal is tracked on the ranch computer from birth tothe slaughterhouse. Zenchiku's hands visit packers to makesure each animal is cut and trimmed to Japanesespecifications.   The payoff for such rigid ranching can be enormous.Japanese consumers don't flinch at spending $50 a pound forJapanese-raised &quot;Waygu&quot; beef. Zenchiku is shooting for thechoice-to-prime niche, which goes for about $20 a pound inJapan.   Meanwhile, Mr. Morse is pondering a new role for the Lazy8: as an executive retreat. He envisions Japanese businessmenjetting here, donning cowboy duds and sitting arounddiscussing weighty issues with top U.S. officials. Some 250Japanese have already visited the ranch, usually on their wayto Las Vegas. Today's group will be off to Colorado for golfin the morning, after a barbeque dinner of homegrown steak --and rice.   &quot;We're a stop on the tour,&quot; says Mr. Morse, readying astack of horseshoes and ties bearing the Lazy 8 brand for hisguests. &quot;This is every Japanese businessman's fantasy.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
