The National Opposition Union also promised legal title topeasants given land under Sandinista agrarian reforms andcompensation for those whose land was confiscated.   It pledges several improved social programs but does not mentionthe tough measures any Nicaraguan government would need to take tohalt inflation and increase production.   A coalition ``Government of National Salvation'' would institutean austerity budget, the platform says without detailing specifics.   President Daniel Ortega's Sandinista government already is takingsome measures. In January, it fired 30,000 public employees, cut itsbudget by more than 40 percent and slashed investments to combatinflation that topped 33,000 percent last year.   But the Sandinistas have failed to create a climate of confidencein the private sector to encourage production. Confiscating land aspunishment for political opposition is among Sandinista measuresthat have antagonized private business and lowered production.   That is one area marked for change by the coalition, which spansa broad spectrum of ideologies range from communist to conservative.   Its platform envisions less state control of the domestic andexport markets, more foreign investment and a freeing of the economy.   It also mentions in several places its intent to separate thearmed forces from politics and reduce the size of the 200,000-strongarmy _ the largest in Central America.   The coalition said it will announce its candidates for presidentand vice president next week. Coalition members still must decidethe procedure for choosing the candidates.   Likeliest choices for their presidential candidate are VioletaBarrios de Chamorro, whose family owns the opposition newspaper LaPrensa; businessman Enrique Bolanos Geyer, and Independent LiberalParty leader Virgilio Godoy.</TEXT></DOC>
