Background</ITAG>Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1977 to address the major healthproblems posed by the States' failures to attain the National Ambient AirQuality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria pollutants. Congress required Statesto revise their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to provide for attainmentof the standards by December 31, 1982, and to submit the revised plansto USEPA by January 1, 1979. Provisions for an extension to December 31,1987, were available if a State could demonstrate that, despite the implementationof all reasonably available control measures, the December 31, 1982, attainmentdeadline could not be met for ozone and/or carbon monoxide (CO). (See Section172(a)). In return for this extension, Congress required the States tosubmit additional air pollution control measures in their 1979 SIP revisions(Section 172(b)(11)). One such additional measure was a commitment to implementan I/M program on an expeditious schedule.To ensure that Federal funds do not further contribute to the already seriousair pollution problems, and to encourage State cooperation, Congress alsoadopted Section 176(a). Section 176(a) of the Act prohibits the Administratorof USEPA and the Secretary of Transportation from awarding certain Federalassistance funds under certain circumstances. These circumstances includewhere: (1) an area has not attained a primary ambient air quality standard;(2) transportation control measures are necessary to attain that primaryambient air quality standard; and (3) the USEPA Administrator determinesthat the State has failed to submit, and is not making reasonable effortsto submit, a plan which considers each of the elements of Section 172 ofthe Act, including the requirement for I/M. On April 10, 1980 (45 FR 24692),after prior notice and public comment, USEPA and the Department of Transportation(DOT) published final policies and procedures for imposing funding restrictionsunder Section 176(a).In the case of Illinois, in June 1979 the State of Illinois submitted its1979 ozone and CO plan for the Chicago area.\1\<NOTE/> As part of this plan, Illinois requested an extension ofthe ozone attainment deadline to 1987 for Cook, Lake, Kane, and DuPageCounties. USEPA approved this request on February 21, 1980 (45 FR 11472).The State subsequently implemented an I/M program on May 1, 1986.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The original Illinois ozone nonattainment counties forthe Chicago area consisted of all of Air Quality Control Region 67, i.e.,Cook, DuPage, Grundy, Kane, Kankakee, Kendall, Lake, McHenry, and WillCounties. See 43 FR 8962 (March 3, 1978), and 43 FR 45993 (October 5, 1978).On May 16, 1983 (48 FR 21947), USEPA redesignated Grundy, Kankakee, Kendall,McHenry and Will counties to attainment. On June 6, 1988 (53 FR 20722),USEPA proposed to redesignate Grundy, Kendall, McHenry, and Will Countiesto nonattainment for ozone under the provisions of the Mitchell-Conte Amendmentof December 22, 1987, (while renewing the ozone nonattainment designationsof Cook, DuPage, Kane, and Lake Counties). This proposal was based on theconcept that all portions of a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area(CMSA) contribute to an ozone problem, and all of these Illinois countiesare within the chicago CMSA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Illinois' I/M program is a contrator operated, centralizednetwork of testing facilities for gasoline powered vehicles and trucksregistered in all of Cook County, the eastern third of Lake County andthe eastern half of DuPage County. Vehicles are tested for hydrocarbonand CO emissions. A probe is inserted into the vehicle tailpipe and theexhaust is analyzed for emissions. If the vehicle passes the test, andannual sticker is issued that indicates compliance with the law. If thevehicle fails to pass the test, the vehicle owner is required to make necessaryrepairs and submit the vehicle for a retest. If the vehicle is unable topass the retest, a 1 year waiver is available under certain conditions.<ITAG tagnum="28">Enforcement of the program is accomplished through a combination ofcomputerized matching and sticker enforcement. The primary enforcementmechanism is the suspension of the drivers' licenses of vehicle ownersand suspension of the vehicles' registrations. The suspensions are madeautomatically by a computer system which tracks vehicles required to betested and actual test data. Motorists are also subject to fines basedon operating a vehicle with an expired or missing sticker.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">USEPA's evaluation of the State's I/M program is contained in technicalsupport documents dated June 6, 1986, February 18, 1987, October 20, 1987,and June 5, 1989. These documents are available from the Region V Officelisted above. On April 24, 1989 (54 FR 16372), USEPA proposed to approvethe Illinois I/M program as meeting current USEPA policy requirements for1982 ozone SIP approval. USEPA will take final action on this program ina future FEDERAL REGISTER notice.</ITAG>The December 31, 1987, ozone attainment deadline has now passed, and theChicago area still has not attained the ozone NAAQS. Because the State'sozone SIP did not provide for attainment of the NAAQS by that date or anynear-term date thereafter, on October 17, 1988, USEPA announced in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> its disapproval of the Chicago portion of theIllinois Ozone SIP (53 FR 40415). On January 18, 1989, the United StatesDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin ordered USEPA to promulgateFederal Implementation Plans (FIPs) for this area and for northwesternIndiana within 14 months, or by March 18, 1990.\3\<NOTE/> In a July 11, 1989 (54 FR 29063), Advance Notice of ProposedRulemaking (ANPR), USEPA gave advance notice of several elements of theFIPs. Among those elements were the emissions inventory for the area andthe required degree of emission reduction to attain and maintain the ozoneNAAQS. Mobile sources account for approximately 50 percent of the Illinoisvolatile organic compound (VOC) emissions inventory. Further, USEPA statedthat it believes a 72 percent reduction in VOC emissions from 1988 levelsis necessary to bring the area into attainment of the ozone NAAQS <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ In April 1987 the State of Wisconsin filed a suit underSection 304 of the Act in the United States District Court for the EasternDistrict of Wisconsin against Lee M. Thomas, then USEPA Administrator (CivilAction No. 87-C-395, now <T3>Wisconsin v. Reilly</T3>). Two counts of the complaint alleged thatUSEPA had failed to perform a non-discretionary duty to approve or disapprovethe greater Chicago area ozone SIPs of Illinois and Indiana. Two othercounts requested the Court to order USEPA to develop FIPs for the northeasternIllinois and northwestern Indiana portions of the Chicago-Gary-Lake County(IL), IL-IN-WI Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) within6 months. The complaint also sought an injuction compelling USEPA to imposeand enforce a moratorium on the construction and modification of majorstationary sources in the Illinois and Indiana portions of the CMSA. Whilethe litigation was in progress, USEPA published final disapprovals of theozone SIP for Illinois on October 17, 1988, and for Indiana on November18, 1988, thereby making the construction moratorium effective as to VOCsources in both areas. The Court, on January 18, 1989, ordered USEPA todevelop FIPs for the Illinois and Indiana portions of the Chicago areawithin 14 months. USEPA is in the process of developing such FIPs.USEPA has been evaluating available control measures necessary to bringthe Chicago area into attainment of the ozone primary NAAQS. Obviously,transportation control measures will be a necessary component of any plandesigned to obtain a 72 percent emission reduction and assure attainmentand maintenance of the ozone standard in the Chicago area. Additionally,USEPA believes that enhancement of the current I/M program is an availableand essential element of any attainment plan for the Chicago area,\4\<NOTE/> and hence is a critical component of the ``reasonable efforts''Illinois must make under Section 176(a) to avoid the imposition of Federalhighway funding restrictions for the nonattainment counties of Cook, Lake,Kane, and DuPage. Enhancement of the I/M program is a control measure USEPAhas identified at the current time as a critical component of ``reasonableefforts''.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ An appropriate level of performance which could be achievedthrough changes to the I/M program would be that which is equivalent inperformance (but not necessarily identical) to an enhanced I/M programcontaining the following features:<ITAG tagnum="28">_centralized biennial inspection;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">_20 model years of passenger cars and light trucks;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">_20 percent stringency for pre-1981 vehicles;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">_idle tests;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">_207(b) emission standards for 1981 and newer vehicles</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">_catalyst, inlet, and lead deposit inspections on 1981 and newer vehicles;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">_five percent waiver on the emission short test.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The computer model Mobile 4 must be used to show equivalency in performanceto the above design by using national or local inputs of tampering/misfuelingrates, vehicle type mix, average speed, etc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Possible enhancements Illinois could implement to achieve the levelof performance of the above enhanced I/M program design would be to requirethe inspection of the gas cap, fuel inlet restrictor, and catalytic converter.If the fuel inlet restrictor test is failed the catalytic converter mustbe replaced. In addition to this enhancement, the geographic coverage ofthe I/M program could be expanded or other program changes such as reducingthe waiver rate could be made to achieve the performance standard. Allof these measures have been successfully implemented in other I/M program;therefore, USEPA considers them available for implementation. Any programdesign, that USEPA determines is equivalent in performance level to theenhanced I/M program outlined above would be acceptable.</ITAG>USEPA has been required by the Court to develop a plan to bring the Chicagoarea into attainment of the health based ozone NAAQS. In addition, underthe Act, the State of Illinois is under a continuing obligation to createits own plan. USEPA believes it is reasonable and necessary for the Stateof Illinois to implement enhancements to its I/M program at this time.The level of enhancements Illinois should implement has already been implementedin Wisconsin's I/M program, and the State of Indiana has enacted legislationrequiring the implementation of the enhancements beginning in January 1990.In the Chicago area, continuing violations of the ozone NAAQS are occurring,transportation control measures will be necessary in any plan designedto achieve attainment and maintenance of the ozone standard, and Illinoishas failed to submit an I/M program commensurate with the severity of theozone problem in the Chicago area, which is a critical component of the``reasonable efforts'' Illinois must make under Section 176(a). Thus, thecriteria listed under Section 176(a) have been met, and for this reasonUSEPA is proposing imposition of Federal highway funding restrictions inCook, Lake, Kane, and DuPage Counties.On August 4, 1989, USEPA notified the State and the Federal Highway Administration(FHWA) that the USEPA/DOT procedures for imposing the funding limitationsunder Section 176(a) were being initiated.\5\<NOTE/> These letters inititated the 30-day consultation period outlinedin the April 10, 1980 (45 FR 24692), <T4>Federal Register</T4> guideline for the Section 176(a) process. Ifthe State enacts and implements adequate enhancements to it I/M programwhich achieve a level of performance equivalent to the enhanced I/M programdesign cited above, then USEPA would not impose sanctions for this reason.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The USEPA Region V Regional Administrator, Valdas V. Adamkus,notified the FHWA Regional Administrator, Herbert R. Teets, and the Governorof Illinois, by letters, that the State of Illinois had failed to submitan ozone attainment plan which considers each element of Section 172 ofthe Act.The consultation period ended September 4, 1989. A description of all furthercorrespondence and meetings which have occurred after August 4, 1989, follows.In an August 31, 1989, letter to the Regional Administrator, Illinois requesteda consultation meeting. On September 26, 1989, a consultation meeting washeld. Representative from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency(IEPA), the Illinois Department of Transportation, the Regional and DistrictOffices of FHWA, USEPA's Office of Mobile Sources, and Region V of USEPAwere present.During the meeting, Region V discussed the rationale for pursuing Federalhighway funding restrictions in Illinois. Representatives from the Stateof Illinois posed several questions related to enhancement of the State'sI/M program and expressed their view on various enhancements. The Staterepresentatives pointed out that they wuld have to obtain direction andauthorization from the legislature before any enhancements could be implemented.The representatives indicated their intent to provide more informationregarding specific enhancements at a future time.USEPA discussed the procedures which would be followed regarding impositionof Federal highway funding restrictions. USEPA informed the State thatit would proceed with the process to propose the imposition of fundingrestrictions and would hold a public hearing regarding the proposed action.USEPA also notified the State that the State legislature would have anopportunity to enact measures to enhance the I/M program before a finaldecision is made on whether to impose the funding restrictions.On October 6, 1989, IEPA submitted several enhanced I/M program alternativesfor review by USEPA. These alternatives were intended to meet USEPA's performancestandard for enhanced I/M. The submittal included possible enhanced I/Mscenarios, the MOBILE 4 printouts from which the vehicle emission rateswere derived, and a discussion of the input parameters used by IEPA inthe model runs. IEPA committed to develop a formal enhanced I/M proposalby October 30, 1989, based on USEPA's response.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Proposed Findings and Actions</ITAG>One available measure that USEPA has identified which Illinois could implementto help bring the area into attainment of the ozone NAAQS is to enhancethe existing I/M program. Because USEPA believes that the State of Illinoishas not used reasonable efforts to submit all measures necessary to attainand maintain the ozone NAAQS in the Chicago area,\6\<NOTE/> USEPA proposes to impose Federal highway funding restrictionsin Cook, Lake, Kane, and DuPage Counties under Section 176(a) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ On October 17, 1988, USEPA disapproved the Chicago portionof the Illinois Ozone SIP (53 FR 40415).During the public comment period, USEPA will consider any comments on thisissue. If Illinois fails to remedy this situation before USEPA takes finalaction, the resulting funding limitations become effective on the datethat the final rulemaking is published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Upon final rulemaking, the Secretary of Transportationwill not approve any projects or award any grants in Cook, Lake, Kane,and DuPage Counties under Title 23 of the United States Code, except forsafety, mass transit, or transportation improvement projects related toair quality improvement or maintenance.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Opportunity for Public Hearing</ITAG>USEPA will schedule a public hearing on its proposed actions regardingFederal highway funding restrictions in the future. A notice of this publichearing will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Request for Public Comment</ITAG>Interested parties are invited to comment on all aspects of the proposedfindings including USEPA's proposed action to impose Federal highway fundingrestrictions. USEPA will consider all testimony received at the publichearings. Additionally, USEPA is keeping the public comment period openfor 30 days after the public hearing date, to provide an opportunity forsubmission of rebuttal information and supplementary information.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Regulatory Impact</ITAG>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 <T3>et seq</T3>., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysisassessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. Under5 U.S.C. 605(b), this requirement may be waived if the Agency certifiesthat the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, smallnot-for-profit enterprises, and governmental entities with jurisdictionsover populations of less than 50,000.If USEPA takes final action and finds that the State has failed to submit,and is not making reasonable efforts to submit, a SIP that considers eachof the elements required by Section 172, certain highway construction fundsunder Title 23 of the United States Code will be withheld. Thus, some smallentities may be affected by final USEPA action.USEPA cannot reliably predict the impact of Clean Air Act restrictionsunder Section 176(a) because of the exemptions authorized for certain highwayprojects. Careful review and evaluation of each project is necessary todetermine whether or not a project is exempt. Consequently, USEPA is makingno quantified assessment of the potential economic impact on small entitiesthat may result from today's proposal.Furthermore, although USEPA believes that a final action might have someimpact on small entities this impact cannot affect the Agency's actions.Under the Clean Air Act, the imposition of the funding restrictions inSection 176(a) is automatic and mandatory whenever the USEPA determinesthat a State has not submitted, or is not making reasonable efforts tosubmit, a SIP which considers each of the elements of Section 172.Under Executive Order 12291, today's action is not ``Major.'' It has beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Anycomments from OMB to USEPA, and any USEPA response, are available for publicinspection at the USEPA Region V office listed above.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Environmental Protection, Hydrocarbons,Intergovernmental relations, Ozone.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Valdas V.
