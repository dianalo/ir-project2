The source, who spoke on condition he not be identified, saidCommander Enrique Bermudez told the rebels about the decisionduring visits Friday to their camps on the Honduran side of theborder with Nicaragua. Bermudez is the chief military leader of therebels, known as Contras.   Radio Liberacion, the Contras' radio station, broadcast onMonday a message from Bermudez that said: ``The rebels will notlaunch any attack against the Sandinistas until February 1990. Wewill not look for combat but will permanently be on the defensive.   ``The rebel army will be preserved intact, on the defense andwatching for the Sandinistas to fulfill their promise of greaterdemocracy for Nicaragua.''   Nicaragua's left-wing government has declared monthly unilateralcease-fires since the expiration of a temporary truce the two sidessigned in March 1988. The truce was to lay the groundwork for apermanent peace but talks collapsed last September.   In February, five Central American presidents agreed to come upwith a plan by mid-May to disband the Contras. Nicaragua, in turn,agreed to elections in February and to take other steps towarddemocratic reforms.   The message broadcast by Radio Liberacion quoted Bermudez assaying: ``The weapons of the freedom fighters constitute the onlyguarantee that the Nicaraguan people have to pressure theSandinistas into fulfilling their promise of introducing democracyto Nicaragua.   ``For that reason, our troops will remain intact and alert, butwill not participate in actions of destruction or attacks againstSandinista military positions.   ``We reaffirm our desire to achieve democracy and freedom forour country through peaceful means, but we reaffirm also ourdecision to achieve these desires through weapons if the peacefulmeans fail.''   Bermudez reportedly left for Miami on Friday.   The rebel source also said Juan Ramon Vivas Romero, known asCommander Quiche, had temporarily stepped down as head of theContras' chiefs of staff because of pain from an old combat wound.The source said Israel Galeano, known as Commander Franklin,replaced Vivas Romero.   Fighting in the 7-year-old war has diminished to sporadicskirmishes since U.S. military aid to the Contras ended in February1988.   It is estimated that about 11,000 rebels and members of theirfamilies are living in camps in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border.   The rebel source said Bermudez told the Contras about abipartisan agreement between Congress and the Bush administrationto provide about $45 million in non-military aid to the rebelsthrough February 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
