Norman, a Prime vice president, said Douglas E. Smith, president of the real-estate limited partnership, and John W. Perkinson, vice president and chief financial officer, will pursue interests in long-term real-estate purchase and investment.

No successor to Mr. Smith has been named, Mr. Norman said. Mr. Smith, 35, and Mr. Perkinson, 29, weren't immediately available for comment.
