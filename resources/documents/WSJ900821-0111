An announcement about the options placement, whicheventually could be valued at as much as $3 billion to theSeattle aerospace manufacturer, is expected to be madeTuesday in Tokyo. Conversion of the five options, meanwhile,is valued at about $650 million.</LP><TEXT>   Combined with orders placed during 1988 and 1989 but notyet filled, All Nippon now has booked 43 Boeing 747-400s. Ofthat total, Boeing said, 26 are currently counted as firm.Options are important because, while they don't add toBoeing's official backlog, they seal a carrier's deliveryposition.   All Nippon, which has been known until recently primarilyas a domestic airline, is in need of planes to expand itsinternational routes. Japan's second largest airline, it nowconnects Japan to 14 destinations in North America, Europe,Asia and Australia, and intends to start flights to Paris inOctober, and to New York next March. By 1995, the companyaims to double the percentage of international flights fromits present 18%.   All Nippon's decision follows a string of large orders forBoeing from Asia in recent months, spotlighting how airtravel in the Pacific Rim continues to boom, even as signs ofweakness have developed in the U.S. market. In June, thecompany received orders for 23 747-400s by Korean Airlines,totaling $4.8 billion. It also has a $2 billion order fromChina's Civil Aviation Administration and a $3.1 billionorder for 747-400s from Japan Air Lines.   Japan's carriers have been increasing competition toprovide international flights recently. Although Japan AirLines was for many years the only one with the right to flyinternational routes, government deregulation in 1985encouraged other airlines to provide services abroad. Inaddition, the soaring number of Japanese tourists recentlyhas strengthened the demand for overseas flights.   Adding to its fleet of 747-400s, which would carry about350 passengers in All Nippon's three-class seatingarrangement, is therefore seen as a necessary move for theairline. Should All Nippon go on to purchase the planes, itwill also lower the average age of its aircraft to less thanseven years from the present 7.8 years. Delivery of theplanes, which will be powered by General Electric Co.engines, could begin in 1995.   The planes ordered earlier will be delivered starting nextweek.   In addition to the 747-400s, All Nippon is also shoppingaround for about 300 other wide-body planes, and is lookingat models made by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and AirbusIndustrie.   In the year ended March 31, All Nippon posted operatingrevenue of $4.3 billion, up 16.4% from the previous year. Netincome rose 3% to $95 million.</TEXT></DOC>
