No money changed hands, and no regulatory approvals were needed.andO;Now, with 800 copies sold since March and 25,000 in use, Wade estimates, shewants to move forward and establish a joint venture which could collectdollars and ultimately send some back to Nantucket in the US.andP;  She iscurrently talking to a number of prospective Soviet partners.andP;  Experience hastaught Wade some interesting lessons.andP;  For example, don't translate yoursoftware completely.andP;  This may be a temporary rule, and for development toolsonly: The quality of the translations is generally so poor - and translationsof technical terms so nonstandard  - that programmers prefer the originalEnglish, she says.andP;  (This bespeaks a market for the conistency provided bymachine-assisted translation.) On the other hand, some degree of localizationis necessary, if only to prevent pirated or simply grey-market copies, soldfor rubles or cheap dollar prices on the Soviet market, from flowing backinto Western markets.andP;  Wade is using much the same strategies in CentralEurope, selling through Videoton and Ecosoft in Hungary (500 copies so far),and just starting up in Poland and Bulgaria.andP;  Currency convertibility is lessof an issue there, but reasonable pricing and the presence of local supportare just as important in encouraging users to become buyers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
