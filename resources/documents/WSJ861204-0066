The commission voted 5-0 to require that costs of certain Canadian natural gas imports be billed in the same way as domestic gas. Commissioners struck down two-thirds of the fixed fees that Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America charges its customers for access to its Canadian gas, regardless of the amount they purchase.    The ruling left the pipeline company free to put the costs into its commodity charge that varies according to the volume sold, a move that would probably reduce Canadian gas sales. The commission, recognizing that such large fixed charges aren't allowed for domestic gas, reasoned that the rules for Canadian and U.S. gas sales should be the same.    U.S. natural gas producers complain that the large fixed fees have kept down the incremental price of Canadian gas, enabling it to undersell domestic gas. Many of the Canadian gas sales come under longstanding contracts under which U.S. pipelines must pay for much of the gas even if they can't use it. Thus, the pipelines accept the pricing structure that increases Canadian sales.    The cost structure has given an &quot;unfair competitive advantage&quot; to Canadian gas, said Robert Platt, natural gas counsel for the Independent Petroleum Association of America.    The ruling applies directly only to Natural Gas Pipeline, an Occidental Petroleum Corp. unit, but is expected to set a broad precedent for pricing Canadian gas. Mr. Platt predicted that it would put pressure on the Canadian gas industry to further lower its prices to compete with U.S. gas. This, he said, should reduce costs to consumers in northern U.S. regions accessible to the increasing imports of Canadian gas. Last year, he said, 5.2% of U.S. gas consumed came from Canada.    The FERC also voted 5-0 to deny petitions that it reconsider its order to raise the ceiling price for most price-controlled, low-cost gas to above current market levels, but the commission did make small changes in the order. The rule is expected to go into effect Dec. 18. </TEXT></DOC>
