In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective the registration statement covering the securities to be issued by Chemical to shareholders of Texas Commerce at the time of the merger.    When the merger between the two banks was announced Dec. 15, its value was estimated at about $1.19 billion. Based on December figures, the transaction would create the nation's fourth-largest banking company.    The combination between Chemical and Texas Commerce will create a bank holding company with assets of about $80 billion and equity capital of about $4 billion. The merger is expected to be completed before the end of June, subject to shareholder approval.    Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of Texas Commerce stock will be exchanged for $7 in cash; 0.09 of a share of Chemical common stock; one share of a new series of Chemical adjustable rate preferred stock with a stated value of $12 each; and one share of a new Chemical Class B common stock. Currently, there are about 33.3 million Texas Commerce common shares outstanding.    Texas Commerce will seek approval at its annual meeting in Houston April 24. Chemical will seek approval at its meeting in New York April 28.    Separately, Chemical's senior debt ratings were lowered to double-A-minus from double-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. The ratings on the banks' subordinated debt also was lowered, to single-A-plus from double-A-minus, by Sandamp;P. About $1.2 billion of long-term debt was affected. The issues were removed from Creditwatch, where they had been placed Dec. 22.    Sandamp;P said the downgrades reflected Chemical's relatively large exposure to Latin American borrowers, continued high levels of nonperforming assets and its pending merger with Texas Commerce. </TEXT></DOC>
