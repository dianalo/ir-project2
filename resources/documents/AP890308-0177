President Bush has said he would veto legislation raising theminimum above $4.25 an hour and told GOP leaders Wednesday that, inthe words of press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, his proposal ``isfair and firm and his last offer.''   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, the labor committee chairman, said he washopeful ``we can reach a compromise that is fairer to the workingpoor and that President Bush will sign.''   Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, said the full Senate couldconsider the measure next week. ``We're all set to go to the floorright away,'' he said. ``I think we'll have strong support.''   The minimum wage, now $3.35 an hour, has not been raised in eightyears.   Kennedy said he is ``glad to listen'' to Republican calls for asub-minimum wage, but only if it is coupled with specificrequirements for training and education.   Kennedy predicted a veto would be overridden.   ``We're going to get this legislation achieved,'' he said. ``Ifit's the judgment that (Bush will) veto it, we'll override it,''Kennedy told reporters after the meeting.   The committee approved the $1.30 increase on an 11-5 vote, withRepublican Sens. David Durenberger of Minnesota and James Jeffordsof Vermont voting with the panel's nine Democrats. The approval cameafter Democrats, joined by Durenberger, rejected the White Houseproposal to raise the hourly minimum 30 cents each year for threeyears, to $4.25.   The House subcommittee on labor standards has scheduled aThursday meeting to draft legislation similar to Kennedy's bill.Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education andLabor Committee, plans to have the full panel consider the $4.65 anhour minimum wage, which he has said he strongly supports.   Bush's proposal, long opposed by Democrats and organized labor,would establish a ``training wage'' of $3.35 an hour, the currentminimum for all workers, and allow employers to pay newly hiredworkers at that rate for their first six months on the job.   While opposition to the sub-miminum wage has softened, Kennedysaid Wednesday that such a category would have to be sharply limitedfrom what the administration wants.   ``I'm not going to see the corruption of the minimum wage byusing the words `training wage' to throw older workers out of workand displace those who want to work 40 hours a week,'' Kennedy said.   ``I'm open to listening, to having the educational componentsoutlined,'' he added. ``There was nothing in the administrationproposal that had an educational component.''   He said such a plan would also have to be limited to first-timeworkers and be for a shorter duration than six months.   Kennedy, while noting the administration's threatened veto,agreed that Bush's call for an increase in the minimum wage hadboosted chances that some increase will soon be approved.   ``This administration has been more forthcoming than the previouseight years,'' the senator said.   The committee approved three amendments to the bill Kennedyintroduced.   The first mirrors a provision in the White House plan to raisethe level at which small businesses are exempted from minimum wageprovisions from gross annual sales of $362,000 to $500,000.   Another proposal, also supported by Bush, would raise from 40percent to 50 percent the so-called tip credit. Employers areallowed to count a certain percentage of tips toward the reportedsalaries of workers covered by the minimum wage.   The committee also accepted a proposal to extend federal minimumwage standards to Puerto Rico.</TEXT></DOC>
