A pre-project was worked out for this project,which shows the boundary conditions and possibilities in detail. Thesystem for generating electricity, district heat and drinking water forthe island of Heligoland is to minimize the use of primary energy, accordingto the results of the pre-project, by sensible optimization of the generation,storage and combination of electricity, district heating ad drinkingwater, by using the regenerative heat sources of the wind and the heatof the sea water.</TEXT></DOC>
