The service announced a month ago it had selected GeneralDynamics over another team consisting of the McDonnell DouglasCorp. and the Martin Marietta Corp. to build the so-called MediumLaunch Vehicle II.   Following that decision, negotiations were opened to finalize acontract and that has now been done, the Air Force added.   The service plans to purchase 11 of the new booster rockets overthe next few years. The first-phase contract covers research anddevelopment expenses along with construction and launch servicesfor the first two boosters.   Over the life of the program, each of the new boosters ``willcost less than $40 million a copy and save the taxpayer hundreds ofmillions of dollars in the process,'' said Air Force SecretaryEdward C. ``Pete'' Aldridge.   ``That's the result of competition.''   The MLV II is part of an ambitious acceleration of umannedrocket programs started by the Pentagon after the loss of theshuttle Challenger. The General Dynamics booster, designed tohandle payloads in the 6,000-pound class, will be a variant of theoft-used Atlas Centaur launcher dubbed the Atlas II.</TEXT></DOC>
