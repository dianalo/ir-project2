William Sessions, in his first news conference since taking over as director of the bureau last week, also said that the FBI has launched an internal investigation to determine why agents failed to uncover previous marijuana use by federal Appeals Court Judge Douglas Ginsburg. FBI officials suspect that some of the 100 or so individuals interviewed about Judge Ginsburg's background -- but never placed under oath -- may have forgotten or withheld important facts from the bureau.    &quot;I don't think you are entitled to lie to a federal investigator,&quot; Mr. Sessions told reporters, without identifying any of the individuals interviewed. In the wake of the furor over Judge Ginsburg's failed nomination to the Supreme Court, the FBI chief added, &quot;It may be that (nominees) should be&quot; interviewed under oath themselves and asked directly about drug abuse.    The White House gave the FBI five days to conduct a background check on Mr. Ginsburg. The process usually takes about 25 days.    Taking a generally hard line on the drug issue, Mr. Sessions also said he believes that any illegal use of marijuana or other narcotics by an FBI agent or a prospective agent -- regardless of how long ago it occurred -- probably should disqualify that person from working for the bureau.    On other matters, Mr. Sessions disclosed that he intends to launch an internal FBI investigation soon to determine whether former White House aides or others improperly influenced or interfered with bureau officials as part of the Iran-Contra affair.    And, despite the prospect of FBI budget cuts mandated under the Gramm-Rudman law, Mr. Sessions indicated that he foresees increased FBI management attention and investigative resources devoted to bank-fraud cases. </TEXT></DOC>
