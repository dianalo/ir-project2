(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The parents of Baby M have failed to reachan out-of-court settlement on surrogate mother Mary BethWhitehead-Gould's visitation rights, sending the matter back tocourt, it was announced Friday.   Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween on Friday set a hearing forMarch 28 to determine the terms under which Mrs. BethWhitehead-Gould may visit the child she bore under a $10,000contract and lost in the landmark court battle.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould is allowed to visit the child for two hoursevery Tuesday pending Sween's decision.   The state Supreme Court on Feb. 3 banned surrogate motherhoodfor pay, voided the $10,000 contract, and reinstated her right tovisit the baby, now legally called Melissa Stern.   The court said a Superior Court judge must decide the conditionsfor visitation if Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and the child's father,William Stern, failed to reach an agreement.   ``We did talk and it did not work. We cannot settle the case,''said Gary N. Skoloff, an attorney for the Sterns. He declined todisclose the positions of both sides.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorney, Harold J. Cassidy, said in astatement Friday night the Sterns had not negotiated with thechild's best interest in mind.   ``It is in the best interest of Melissa that she have theopportunity to know and love and respect her mother,'' he said.``Until Mr. and Mrs. Stern learn to accept this simple fact, therecannot be further discussions.''   The Baby M case began when the Sterns signed a contract withMrs. Whitehead-Gould for her to be artificially inseminated withStern's sperm and bear them a child.   After the child was born, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould decided shecouldn't give up the baby. The Sterns sued to get the child back.   On March 31 Superior Court Judge Harvey R. Sorkow upheld thecontract, terminated Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's right to the baby,awarded custody to the Sterns and let Stern's wife, Elizabeth,adopt the baby.   The Supreme Court, in its 7-0 ruling, overturned all but thecustody decision.</TEXT></DOC>
