Dozens of lawyers who handle free-press cases gathered tocelebrate -- complete with a multi-tiered, chocolate birthdaycake -- the 200th anniversary of the First Amendment, whichwas ratified with the rest of the Bill of Rights in December1791.</LP><TEXT>   Yet at a daylong conference that was the focal point ofthe commemoration, there was an undercurrent that wasanything but celebratory. The message was a warning that thegolden age of the First Amendment may be over.   &quot;The press has done extraordinarily well in the SupremeCourt in the last six decades,&quot; said Timothy Dyk, aWashington lawyer, &quot;but now things don't look as good. . . .There is reason to fear that this is not going to continue.&quot;   The principal cause of concern is two cases the SupremeCourt is expected to decide before it recesses in late June.One poses the question whether, in a libel lawsuit, the FirstAmendment protects use of false or altered quotations by thenews media. The other involves whether the First Amendmentprotects the news media against lawsuits for breach ofcontract for breaking promises of confidentiality to newssources.   Some people at the conference said the news media andtheir lawyers bear at least partial blame for the expectedweakening of First Amendment protections because they failedto take responsibility in court for mistakes or poorjudgment.   The news media failed to demonstrate &quot;a willingness to becontrite&quot; in the Supreme Court, said Floyd Abrams, a New Yorklawyer. &quot;If the press has values it cares about,&quot; he argued,&quot;it better articulate those values in court, lest it beperceived as having no values at all.&quot;   Not everyone agreed. &quot;There are limits to the benefits ofself-flagellation,&quot; Mr. Dyk said.   A more humble attitude still might help the media in thepending lawsuit by Minneapolis political consultant Dan Cohenagainst the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch and theMinneapolis Star andamp; Tribune -- published, respectively, byKnight Ridder Inc., and Cowles Media Co. Mr. Cohen sued forbreach of contract after the newspapers named him as thesource of negative information about a political candidatedespite reporters' promises to treat him as an anonymoussource. Mr. Cohen's case went to trial and he won $450,000,but the Minnesota Supreme Court threw out the award.   News media lawyers have based their defense on the FirstAmendment and procedural issues. But nowhere, Mr. Abramsobserved, have they said that &quot;what the Minnesota papers didwas wrong.&quot;   Questions about the media's strategy also are raised inthe other pending case, filed by psychiatrist Jeffrey Massonagainst the New Yorker magazine and author Janet Malcolm. Healleges that she doctored or fabricated quotations in amagazine profile and subsequent book that damaged hisreputation. A federal judge summarily rejected Mr. Masson'slegal claims before trial, on the theory that any changes inthe quotations were reasonable and were protected by theFirst Amendment. A federal appeals court upheld the pretrialdismissal.   Mr. Abrams said news media lawyers should have arguedfirst that &quot;if Ms. Malcolm had done what they say she did,she should be condemned.&quot; Instead, they simply argued for theprotection of the First Amendment, without acknowledgingethical concerns.   The New Yorker case raises another question about themedia's legal strategy. Alex Kozinski, a federal appealscourt judge from Pasadena, Calif., who dissented in the case,said during last week's conference that the press is tooquick to move for dismissal of lawsuits against it beforegoing to trial.   News media lawyers often seek dismissal to avoid theexpense of a trial. But when a case is dismissed beforetrial, the appellate court later must accept the facts asalleged by the plaintiff, and the news media can't fullydevelop what may be a favorable factual record.   In the New Yorker case, for instance, Ms. Malcolm deniesmaking up or changing quotes, but the Supreme Court mustassume that she did and decide whether the First Amendmentprotects her. Regardless of the outcome, the New Yorker,which won at the trial and appellate levels, probably wouldhave been happy to forgo its day in the Supreme Court.</TEXT></DOC>
