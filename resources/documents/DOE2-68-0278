Spectra werecollected in constant final state (CFS) mode for electron kinetic energiesranging from 2 eV to 90 eV. The use of CFS mode allowed the electronescape length to remain constant during individual spectra. The electronescape length for the reaction layer as a function of kinetic energywas then determined by monitoring the intensity of the bulk silicon signal.Thus, by analyzing the proportions of each silicon fluoride species observedin the individual CFS spectra as a function of the electron escape depthin the reaction layer, the distribution of the silicon fluoride speciesin the layer was obtained. The distribution determined placed SiF atthe interface between the reaction layer and the bulk silicon, and theremaining species, SiF/sub 2/, SiF/sub 3/ and SiF/sub 4/, successivelylayered on top. This observation leads to a model for the structure ofthe reaction layer.</TEXT></DOC>
