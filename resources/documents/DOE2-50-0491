In the riser partof the reactor, pulsations and microwhirls are produced in order to hinderthe coalescence of the microbubbles and to increase the rate of exchangebetween gas and liquid. The reactor comprises a downcomer part, the sectionof which is many times smaller than the one of the riser part. In theupper part, a subsurface aerator is arranged, and in the riser part thereare provided corrugated-pipe or similar obstacles for producing pulsationsand microwhirls. The reactor further comprises a heat exchanger as wellas an adjusting control device. The water outlet comprises an outgassingdevice. If necessary, an agitator may be included. With such a processit is possible to reduce the volume of the construction and the expenditureof energy, while the entered oxygen power is enhanced many times anda maximum utilization of the oxygen is obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
