These tendencies surfaced most recently in the letters, phone callsand hand gestures inspired by a column earlier this month that detailed onetown's extraordinary efforts to bag speeders.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  READERS WEIGH TWIN EVILS OF PHOTO-RADAR,SPEEDING  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Streetwise  </MEMO><TEXT>     The city of Campbell uses a photo-radar machine in the back of a Jeep toclick pictures of speeders while a community service officer sits in front andrecords license numbers. The officer and the speeder don't meet right away --instead, the speeder is mailed a ticket and a notice that more or less says&quot;Gotcha.&quot;;    Not surprisingly, not everyone is crazy about the high-techsnare. But, the mail on this one indicates that the world can be divided intotwo camps -- speeders and those who hate them.; I, TOO, WAS a victim of thephoto radar detector. . . . I feel they are a bunch of hypocrites, when inreality they are using their badge only to generate revenue . . . To Chief(James A.) Cost and the merchants of Campbell, your extreme method ofgenerating revenue gives me a paranoid feeling when entering Campbell, and Ihave decided to take my business outside of Campbell.;    Dangerous Don Boehm;Los Gatos;    Don, may I call you Dangerous? I don't blame you for beingangry, but the Campbell P.D. insists it doesn't make oodles of money on thephoto radar machine. In the program's first year, the city racked up $56,263in fines. But $42,889 of that went to the private company that administers theprogram, leaving the city with $13,374. Still, your boycott of Campbell seemsan appropriate protest. Just don't be too hasty traveling through the city onyour way to shops in other towns.; IT SMACKS OF George Orwell's 1984. The wayyou wrote it, the tone of it, to me tended to glamorize it. Maybe I shouldtake a picture of myself writing a check and send it to them.;    RobertRussell; West Valley College math teacher;  Might be worth a try, or maybe youcould break out the old video camera and take pictures of the police takingpictures of speeders. Naw. That would be moving from George Orwell to FranzKafka.; LET ME INTRODUCE you to Miller Avenue, the most traffic-violated andabused residential street in Saratoga. . . . I estimate that over half of thevehicles exceed the speed limit by 10 or more mph. If you would like to make afirsthand observation of the &quot;Miller Speedway,&quot; please let me know. I willcool a six-pack of your designated favorite, and we can sit on my front porchand watch the traffic whiz by.;    Elmer G. Szanto; Saratoga;    Sgt. KenKahn, spokesman for the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department, said a squadcar will be sent to Miller Avenue to discourage and ticket speeders pronto. Hesuggests that those who live in areas patrolled by the sheriff's departmentcall if they have similar problems.;    Oh, and mine's Henry Weinhard's.;SHELLEY AVENUE is a narrow street, and I can't begin to tell you how fast theycome through here. You might as well turn it north and south and put it on(Highway) 17 and have another lane. We have complained and complained andcomplained.;    Lenore Perrett; Campbell;    Lt. Dave Gullo, who heads thetraffic division in Campbell, says keep complaining and complaining andcomplaining. He says patrol cars have gone out to spook speeders on Shelleyand that the department is trying.;    His number, by the way, is (408)866-2177.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mike Cassidy column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910818  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  670  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday August 18, 199100231083,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
