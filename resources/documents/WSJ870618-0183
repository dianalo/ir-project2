You answer my thesis about President Reagan's responsibility for violating the congressional ban on funds for the Contras as though I had argued that Congress may use its power over the purse to strip individuals of their constitutional rights or presidents of their constitutional prerogatives, including a president's prerogative to exercise his veto or advocate his policies. I argued no such thing.    Article I of the Constitution -- which gives Congress the power to raise money, support armies and declare war, and which bars expenditures without congressional appropriation -- clearly authorizes Congress to prevent the executive branch from raising and deploying funds directly or indirectly to wage war in Nicaragua. Of course Congress cannot constitutionally gag the president by preventing him from expressing his view that private and foreign groups should support such a war on their own. No one suggests that Congress could cut off the president's salary if he spends his time, or wields his pen, in urging that support. But there is all the difference in the world between simply advocating such aid and deploying a CIA-NSC network of operatives to raise the money and channel it to White House-designated targets of opportunity.    When Henry II asked in the presence of his henchmen, &quot;Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?&quot; he was engaged in more than abstract advocacy. The Iran-Contra hearings already suggest -- and independent counsel Lawrence Walsh may be able to prove -- that Ronald Reagan or George Bush did even more than ask, in the presence of covert operatives, &quot;Will no one rid us of these meddlesome Sandinistas?&quot; If they either set such a scheme in motion or deliberately winked while admirals and lieutenant colonels did the dirty work with the help of wealthy friends, foreign and domestic, then holding the president or vice president accountable through indictment or impeachment proceedings would be a far cry from using the power of the purse to &quot;unseparate the powers,&quot; as your editorial states. Enforcing the rules against criminal conspiracy upon the highest officeholders in the land would, in these circumstances, do no more than remind the nation that no one is above the law.    Your editorial concludes by invoking the &quot;real world {of} politics&quot; to deny the plausibility of impeachment. I do not question that judgment. All I question is the wisdom of reading a Teflon-president clause into the Constitution. In its bicentennial year, our founding document deserves a more honest reading than that.    Laurence H. Tribe   Tyler Professor of Constitutional Law    Harvard University Law School   Cambridge, Mass.   ---   In leading the impeachment charge I believe Prof. Tribe, though a constitutional scholar, subordinates his knowledge of constitutional tradition to his own political views. Constitutional tradition affords presidents wide latitude to formulate and implement foreign policy, especially as it relates to what a president conceives as a matter affecting national security. After all, we trust him with exclusive authority to use nuclear weapons in our security interest as well as send the armed forces to war as our commander in chief -- matters far more serious than keeping the Contras viable between votes of a fickle Congress to support them militarily.    The Founders conveyed extraordinary powers to the president's office and strictly limited the avenues of intrusion by the other branches. Among them are the ability to override any judicial action with a pardon (a power that extends so far as to permit intervention to halt the workings of the judicial system before indictment -- e.g., the Nixon pardon) and separate and distinct authority over the armed forces, the institution embodying the greatest potential threat to our liberties.    Through these powers the president is certainly above the law, as that phrase is commonly understood. And the power of Congress to intrude surely does not extend to being able to dictate to the executive, simply because it approves the budget legislation that pays his salary.    We cannot have a functioning presidency if those who disagree with policy decisions made -- perhaps erroneously but in good faith -- threaten criminal action against the president's staff (and indeed, the president himself). That is what elections are for. It is especially disturbing to see the argument for such an unprecedented intrusion into the prerogatives of the president based upon a tortured reading of Congress's power of the purse.    John A. McMullen   Lecturer in Business Strategy   Harvard University Law School   Cambridge, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
