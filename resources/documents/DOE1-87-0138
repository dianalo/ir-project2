<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-87-0138 </DOCNO><TEXT>A study of microscopic fluctuations of density n-tilde and potential PHI-tildein the scrape-off layer has been performed. The frequency spectra ofn-tilde and PHI-tilde show a strongly turbulent character, as observedin many tokamaks. The fluctuation levels of n-tilde/n and ePHI-tilde/kT/sube/ are consistent with predictions based on non-linear collisional driftwave models. The line average density and heating power dependences ofn-tilde/n and ePHI-tilde/kT/sub e/ are studied in two types of currentlessplasma, namely electron cyclotron resonance heating plasmas and neutralbeam injection heating plasmas. Their parametric dependences are comparedwith the trends of the energy confinement time. Finite beta effects onePHI-tilde/sub f//kT/sub e/ and n-tilde/n are also discussed.
