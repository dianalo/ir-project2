LEVI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Argentine citizen who was arrested byMexican authorities after he identified the body of Israelicounterterrorism expert Amiram Nir has been released, ArgentineEmbassy sources said Wednesday.   The sources said on condition of anonymity that immigrationauthorities released Pedro Curchet this week after he proved hisidentity and showed he was in the country legally.   Nir, 38, died Nov. 30 when a small private plane he chartered inthe western Mexican town of Uruapan crashed on a flight to MexicoCity.   Nir, an adviser on counterterrorism to two Israeli primeministers until 1987, was linked to the Iran-Contra affair andformer National Security staffer Col. Oliver North.   Associates in Uruapan said Nir was negotiating to buy avocadosfor export to Europe and Israel and that Curchet was an official ofan avocado exporting company called Eupasa.   Curchet was one of the people who identified Nir's body on Dec.1, and he was detained on suspicion that he was engaged in businessactivities in Mexico without a work permit.   ``We were informed Tuesday that he had been freed. Apparently, hecould not produce personal documents at the time he was detained. Hesaid he had given them to a lawyer who was getting him workingpapers,'' one source said.   ``And, apparently, the lawyer came forth and produced hispassport and he was freed,'' the source said.   The sources said Curchet was not in contact with the ArgentineEmbassy before his arrest, although Argentine nationals in Mexicoare required to register at the embassy.   The sources said the embassy also did not know Curchet's age,hometown, or other personal details. Curchet could not be locatedWednesday, although his luggage was still being held by a hotel inUruapan, about 200 miles west of Mexico City.   A secretary for the Mexican Interior Ministry's press office saidnobody was available for comment.   Nir made several trips to Europe and Iran in arranging for thesecret sale of weapons to Iran in exchange for the release of U.S.hostages in Lebanon, and U.S. officials had been seeking him fortestimony in the Iran-Contra case.   Nir used his own name in business dealings in Uruapan but gavethe assumed name of Pat Weber when he rented the plane.   Mexican authorities said a preliminary investigation blamed thecrash on mechanical failure.   An airline employee who had hitched a ride on the flight alsodied.   The pilot and Adriana Stanton, 25, a Canadian citizen who workedfor Eupasa, were seriously injured but were reported in goodcondition after undergoing operations Wednesday. Stanton apparentlyalso used an assumed name for the charter flight.   Nir, son of Holocaust survivors, was buried Tuesday at a suburbanTel Aviv cemetery in Israel. Hundreds of people, including Cabinetministers and former colleagues, attended the funeral.   Also on Tuesday, the Long Island newspaper Newsday quotedintelligence sources as saying Nir kept in contact with U.S.intelligence officials until his death.   The Newsday report said Nir may have been involved in a largeshipment of Israeli weapons that arrived in the Gulf of Mexico portof Veracruz last week to bolster Mexico's drug fighting forces.   On Monday, an informed Israeli source told The Associated Pressthat Nir was a licensed Israeli arms dealer, but former colleaguesand friends said there was no evidence Nir ever used the license.   One friend said Nir was tired of arms dealing after theIran-Contra affair and went into the fruit and vegetable importingbusiness with a base in London.</TEXT></DOC>
