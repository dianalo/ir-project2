By a vote of 98-1, the Senate endorsed the costly stealth bomberif it meets flight testing standards and demonstrates that it canperform its mission of evading radar detection and penetrate Sovietair space.   Bush administration officials have expressed hope that theSenate vote on the bomber in the president's $295 billion defensebudget would serve as a counterbalance to expected votes in theHouse cutting the program.   The House takes up the issue Wednesday when it considersamendments to eliminate or severly limit the program.   In crafting its defense blueprint, the House cut $1.8 billionfrom the $4.9 billion Bush had proposed for Star Wars, formallyknown as the Strategic Defense Initiative. Lawmakers approved anamendment to cut $700 million from the program in addition to the$1.1 billion the House Armed Services Committee had trimmed fromthe program.   The vote was 248-175, with 214 Democrats and 34 Republicansvoting for the reduction.   ``We serve notice on the administration to bring this futuristicprogram down into the world of budget reality,'' Rep. John M.Spratt, Jr., D-S.C., declared just before the House reduced fundsfor the anti-missile shield.   After reducing SDI spending, the House overwhelmingly approvedusing $150 million of the Star Wars money for such items ashelicopters, artillery rockets and Army ammunition, and $300million for cleanup of nuclear defense facilities.   Members also approved spending $450 million in the fiscal yearbeginning Oct. 1, the 1990 year, and $600 million in fiscal 1991for military drug interdiction.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, on Capitol Hill for a meetingwith Senate Republicans, said the House decision on Star Wars``seriously undermines the program.''   ``I'm confident the Senate will do better. I'm confident we willcome out of the Senate with our program basically intact, includingthe Strategic Defense Initiative and the B-2 bomber,'' said Cheney,a former congressman from Wyoming.   Cheney's prediction for the Senate was largely on target aslawmakers approved a modest cut of $300 million in the $4.7 billionrequested by Bush for the B-2 in the new fiscal year.   The Senate restrictions, sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Sen. JohnWarner of Virginia, the panel's ranking GOP member, was intended toinsure that the B-2 perform as advertised before a decision is madeto build a full fleet of 132 planes.   Echoing administration officials, Nunn said, ``What we want todo is put great fear in them (the Soviets), ... great pause as towhat we would do and what we are capable of doing after they havelaunched a first strike.''   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., voted against the amendment. Sen.Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, is hospitalized and did not vote.   The Senate also voted 99-0 to increase by $1.9 billion in thenew fiscal year, and by $2.1 billion in the following year, thefunds available to provide modern combat gear and weapons for thetroops of the National Guard and military reserve forces.   In a 98-1 roll call, the Senate also approved a Nunn-Warneramendment aimed at improving the effectiveness of small infantryunits through the development of improved weapons and equipment.Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., voted no.   Cheney's concerns about the House held true as member rejectedan amendment to accept the defense secretary's procurement budget.The vote, largely along party lines, was 278-143.   Prior to the final Star Wars vote, the House rejected an evendeeper cut in the anti-missile shield as well as an amendment thatwould have restored all but $300 million to the administration'srequest.   The ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee,Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, agreed that conventional forcesneed more money, ``but the problem is we're taking it from thewrong source.''   ``There comes a point when you keep dipping out of thisparticular program you're going to kill it,'' he said.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked if Bush would vetoany bill that cuts money for Star Wars, told reporters: ``We're along way from considering vetoes. ... We're talking now aboutwinning, not about vetoes.''   Republican Rep. John Rowland of Connecticut attributed theadministration's defeat on Star Wars to the emphasis it has placedon lobbying for the B-2 stealth bomber.   ``They focused hard on this issue,'' Rowland said, referring tothe bomber. ``They got creamed on SDI.''   Lawmakers have expressed ``sticker shock'' at the B-2 program'scost estimates _ $23 billion already invested, eventually a totalof $70 billion for 132 planes or $530 million per copy.   The House Armed Services Committee voted for deep cuts in theprogram, slashing $800 million from the Bush request, and is toconsider measures to terminate the program or place strict limitson further spending.   By voice vote Tuesday, the Senate approved an amendmentrequiring the Pentagon to report to Congress by December onalternatives to a 132-bomber force. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,D-Mass., in introducing the measure, said, ``132 is not magic; wemust examine a smaller force.''   The Bush administration, meanwhile, reiterated its argument thatelimination of the B-2 would force the United States to revise itsposition in strategic arms reduction talks with the Soviet Union.   National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, in a letter toWarner, said, ``It is important that we do not send the wrongsignal to the Soviets regarding U.S. resolve to maintain a strong,viable triad'' of air, land and sea forces.</TEXT></DOC>
