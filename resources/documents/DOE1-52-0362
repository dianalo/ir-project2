The first extends in an E-W direction along the coastline andis succeeded landward by a second ridge which is older and rests on pre-Pleistocenedeposits. The first (more seaward) ridge is composed mainly of ooidswith subordinate proportions of peloids, shell fragments and quartz grains(oolitic limestone ridge). The second ridge is also chiefly composedof ooids but quartz grains and skeletal fragments are much more abundantthan in the first ridge (quartz-oolitic limestone ridge). Subaerial cementationwas observed in the oolitic limestone ridge, but it is better developedin the quartz-oolitic limestone ridge where the sparry calcite cementincreases in crystal size and fills most of the intergranular pores.Some micritic peloids have been almost completely recrystallized to sparrycalcite and all the grains are covered by fringes of sparry calcite cement.The oolitic limestone ridge is correlated with the younger and olderoolitic limestones of Al-Khiran area, and the quartz-oolitic limestonecorrelates with the quartz-oolitic sandstone and oolitic quartzose sandstoneof Al-Khiran. The oolitic deposits of Al-Doha area are diageneticallyimmature and this can be attributed to insufficiency of meteoric waterrequired to complete the diagenetic development of the deposits. 27 references.</TEXT></DOC>
