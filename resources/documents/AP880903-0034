(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's most powerful unmannedrocket failed to lift a secret military satellite into the properorbit, effectively rendering it useless, according to a sourceclose to the space program.   Engineers were trying to determine whether they could salvagethe satellite launched atop a 16-story Titan 34D Friday morning,the source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said late Fridaynight.   However, the source was not hopeful anything could be done toplace it in the correct orbit.   A civilian expert has said the booster carried a satellite thatcould eavesdrop on Soviet military and diplomatic communications.   A successful launch would have been the third in a row for theTitan 34D, which was grounded for 18 months after two explosions.   Lt. Col. Ron Rand, director of public affairs at the EasternSpace and Missile Center here, said the Air Force had a policy ofnot commenting on the results of military space launches.   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Maj. William O'Connell said heknew of no problem with the launch.   The three-stage Titan 34D roared away from its launch pad hereat 8:05 a.m Friday.   The booster's third stage ignited correctly, putting thesatellite in a highly elliptical orbit ranging from 100 miles to22,300 miles above the Earth, the source said.   But the rocket failed to re-ignite, which would have put thepayload in a geosynchronous, or stationery, orbit 22,330 miles overthe Equator, said the source.   A military reconnaissance satellite would be useless unless itwas in a geosynchronous orbit.   The Air Force, following its practice of recent years, did notannounce the launch in advance, but issued a statement afterward.   John E. Pike, a space policy expert for the Washington-basedFederation of American Scientists, said last month the payloadwould be a satellite designed to monitor Soviet missile tests andmonitor radio, telephone, radar and other electronic military anddiplomatic communications.   He said the satellite carried an antenna built to unfold to thesize of a baseball field.   The launch was the third for the Titan 34D, which will remainthe nation's most powerful unmanned rocket until an upgradedversion, the Titan 4, makes its launch debut later this year, alsowith a military satellite. Both are made by Martin Marietta Corp.in Denver.   A Titan 34D carrying a reconnaissance satellite was launchedsuccessfully last October from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.Another blasted away from Cape Canaveral a month later and placedinto orbit a satellite to provide warning of a hostile missileattack.   Before the October launch, the Titan 34D had been grounded for18 months following two straight explosions of the rocket.   ``These two launches (from Canaveral) and last October's launch(from Vandenberg) illustrate the success of America's return to amore robust space-launch capability,'' the Air Force said in itspost-launch statement.   During the long Titan 34D grounding, the Air Force was unable tolift heavy military satellites into orbit because the only otheravailable carrier, the manned space shuttle, was grounded becauseof the Challenger explosion in January 1986.   That led to a critical backlog of military payloads waiting toget into space. To help break that logjam, the Air Force is backingdevelopment of Titan 4, Titan 2 and Delta 2 rocket systems. Theywill make their first launches either late this year or early nextyear, and are expected to see considerable use over several years.</TEXT></DOC>
