The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkU.S. grade of crude oil, fell 71 cents a barrel on the New YorkMercantile Exchange, closing the day at $20.61. Other contractmonths closed as much as 79 cents lower.   Analysts said a report shortly after midday EDT that somemembers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries wereboosting production to take advantage of rising crude pricestriggered a sell-off.   Ed Ryan, energy analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said themarket had been ``nervously quiet'' until then.   ``When the statement came from OPEC that it was increasing itsproduction, that triggered profit-taking,'' Ryan said.   OPEC is believed to be producing about 20.5 million barrels aday, 2 million above its self-imposed quota. Since it establishedthe quota last November to boost world oil prices, crude priceshave risen more than 60 percent.   Many investors also were jittery in the absence of newinformation about the resumption of North Sea oil production afterlast week's gas explosion.   News of the accident on Tuesday sent crude prices soaring morethan $3 a barrel to a three-year high. The accident disrupted theflow of Brent crude through a major pipeline, which affected theproduction of at least 500,000 barrel.   The North Sea disruption compounded fears of an already tightgasoline supply situation at the onset of the driving season.Analysts said a decision Friday by the Environmental ProtectionAgency giving Massachusetts until June to impose new higher octaneregulations also helped soften prices.   In addition, they said that rumors circulating in the marketabout possible foreign gasoline supplies also contributed to thedecline.   ``We heard that new deliveries are coming in from LatinAmerica,'' said John Hill, an energy broker with Merrill LynchEnergy Futures. ``Gasoline that would normally go to Europe iscoming here because prices are so high here.''   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasolinefor May delivery dropped 1.93 cents to 72.23 cents a gallon, withmost other contracts down 2 cents. Heating oil for May slid 1.82cents to 51.81 cents a gallon, with other contracts 2 cents lower.</TEXT></DOC>
