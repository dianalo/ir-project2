Since May 26, when Bulgaria started the deportations, the numberof arrivals has reached 16,297, the foreign ministry said today.Tent cities are being erected in a hurry.   ``As if they (the Bulgarians) are trying to test the strength andpower of the Turkish state, they are sending wave after wave ofpeople to the border,'' Cabinet minister Ercument Konukman toldreporters.   Publicly, Premier Turgut Ozal has said Turkey will accept alldeported ethnic Turks. But officials say Turkey's resources will beseverely strained if the forced exodus from Bulgaria continues.   The present wave of immigration comes at a time when Turkey ishard pressed with other refugee problems.   In August, 50,000 Kurds fleeing Iraqi attacks crossed the borderinto Turkey. About 35,000 of them remain, housed in tent cities andcrowded apartment buildings in southeastern Turkey.   According to official estimates, Turkey is also home to 600,000Iranians who fled the Islamic revolution or the war with Iraq andsettled in Turkish cities, principally Istanbul.   Bulgaria began deporting ethnic Turks after unrest in thenortheastern and southern regions last month. Many deported ledresistance to a forced assimilation campaign that began in 1983 andincludes changing ethnic Turks Moslem names to Slavic ones.   Also under the campaign, Sofia barred the public use of theTurkish language and practice of Islamic religious rites.   Deportees said police attacked ethnic Turks at late Maydemonstrations against the campaign with dogs and clubs, killingabout 40 people.   Turkey has proposed negotiations with Bulgaria to hammer out animmigration agreement that would allow ethnic Turks to dispose oftheir property and bring out liquid assets. Deportees have said theywere not allowed to take with them more than a suitcase.   Bulgaria claims the Moslem minority numbers 780,000 while Turkishofficials put it at 2.5 million in the total population of 9 million.   Through defections and immigration agreements, 380,00 ethnicTurks have come to Turkey since 1925.</TEXT></DOC>
