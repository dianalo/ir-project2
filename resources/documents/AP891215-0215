Sakharov, who sacrificed position for principle,disdained his persecutors and became a universal symbol of theunquenchable human spirit.   The 68-year-old Soviet scientist and humanist died Thursdaynight of an apparent heart attack in his Moscow apartment.   On Friday morning, the Soviet Congress stood in a minute ofsilent mourning for a fellow member, who first was a national herofor building the hydrogen bomb, then reviled for insisting on humanfreedom, and finally released from internal exile by Mikhail S.Gorbachev in 1986.   One legislator called him a man ``such as maybe appears once ina hundred years.''   President Gorbachev, with whom Sakharov had severalconfrontations, said he ``was a man of conviction and sincerity. Hewas not some sort of political intriguer. He was a person who hadhis own ideas, his own convictions which he expressed openly anddirectly. This doesn't mean I agreed with him, although on manythings we did agree.''   President Bush said: ``All of us who knew him will never forgethis courage and devotion to freedom. In the darkest hours of hisstruggle for human rights in the Soviet Union, he embodied all thatis good and decent in the human spirit.''   To Margaret Thatcher, prime minister of Britain, Sakharov was``a remarkable person. There was this fantastic courage, and amongthe scientific people there was a tremendous capacity for originalthought.   ``It did not stop with the science, but went into freedom,liberty, politics and culture. He worked so hard for everythingthat is coming to pass in the Soviet Union. He was one of those whowould always say the truth must be found and was never afraid ofstating that and letting everyone know.''   ``It is just sad he will not be preeminent in the freer futureof the Soviet Union.''   Lech Walesa, leader of Poland's Solidarity trade union and afellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said Sakharov's death was ``agreat loss for reform. ... It is very bad that God's sentences aresuch. We needed this man.''   In a telegram to Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner, he said: ``Thewave of reforms that he has fought for flows over all EasternEurope today.''   Vaclav Havel, the human rights activist who appears close tobecoming the new president of Czechoslovakia, said Sakharov's workwas ``one of the cornerstones of the future European home andworldwide understanding.''   ``A towering figure of his time'' was how U.N. Secretary-GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar described Sakharov. ``His life spanned aperiod of immense complexity and change in the history of hiscountry,'' Perez de Cuellar said.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, Polish Prime MinisterTadeusz Mazowiecki, Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson of Sweden andRuud Lubbers, the Dutch premier, were among the many leaders whosent telegrams or praised Sakharov.   President Francois Mitterrand of France sent a message to Mrs.Sakharov saying her husband knew ``better than anyone else ... howto reconcile scientific discipline with humanist values. He leavesthe memory of a rouser of conscience and indefatigable defender ofhuman dignity.''   Aase Lionaes, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee thatawarded Sakharov the Peace Prize in 1975, said he ``fell in thestruggle for democratic reforms. His death represents a great loss,especially at a time with hopes of a positive development in theSoviet Union and in all Eastern Europe.''   Norwegian painter Victor Sparre, an old friend, called Sakharov``the greatest reconciler of our century. He gave his life forother people's freedom.''   ``We have lost our moral compass,'' said Roald Sagdeyev, formerhead of the Soviet space program, who worked with Sakharov in theCongress of People's Deputies and the Soviet Academy of Sciences.   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel said: ``We are pained bythe loss of the great fighter for human rights, for the rights ofSoviet Jews and prisoners of Zion. Andrei Sakharov will always beremembered as the man who deserves great appreciation by the Jewishpeople.''   Natan Sharansky, who spent nine years in Soviet labor camps andimmigrated to Israel in 1986, said: ``Sakharov had tremendousinfluence ... among dissidents, among free people in the SovietUnion, and ... by his own personal example helped change the wholeclimate in the Soviet Union.''   Marie Staunton, director of the human rights group AmnestyInternational, said Sakharov ``represented a whole generation ofpeople ... in what seemed at that time a hopeless situation.Everybody looked up to him, his death is really the end of an era.''   In Beijing, however, China's official media Saturday carriedonly one-sentence reports of Sakharov's death without mentioninghis role as the Soviet Union's leading dissident.   Earlier this week, in protests over the 1989 Nobel Peace Prizeawarded to Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, the Chinesepress also criticized Sakharov's receiving the prize in 1975.</TEXT></DOC>
