But a wide grin creases his features now as he shuffles through a foot of fresh snow and four baying hounds to chuck a snowball at a snarling mountain lion perched in a short pine one leap away.    For 23 years, almost all his working life, Mr. Paque (pronounced puh-KAY) has made his living behind his pack of hounds, primarily running down and killing black bears to minimize timber damage. As the sole remaining professional hunter for a timber-company group, he has a life style as primitive as the old frontier, and often as violent.    Benefits abound. The 52-year-old Mr. Paque goes to work along old trails that are often shrouded in the bewitching beauty of silent dark pines heavy with fresh snow. The air is fresh. Deer, grouse and other wildlife abound. The job is exciting and Mr. Paque loves it. He also is good at it. By his own count, he has bagged 2,300 bears, 550 bobcats and 73 mountain lions, or cougars, over the years.    But &quot;Bernie's days as a professional hunter are numbered,&quot; says his boss, Ralph Flowers. For one thing, black bears, his main quarry, aren't in surplus in the Northwest anymore, so are no longer hunted year-round without limits. Also, instead of killing bears to curtail springtime tree damage, Washington timber companies are more and more using an experimental feeding program. And to hunt down those bears that nevertheless remain destructive, the authorities are increasingly giving special permits to sport hunters, leaving less work for professional hunters like Mr. Paque.    The thought of abandoning his work depresses Mr. Paque. &quot;I've had a lot of fun,&quot; he says. To bridge the change, he is trying to build a livelihood out of guiding sport hunters; that mountain lion he just chucked a snowball at is &quot;reserved&quot; for a client. But there is no certainty that Mr. Paque can convert an obsolescent occupation into a modern means of support.    When Mr. Paque first became a professional hunter at the age of 28, bears were so numerous near his home in Clallam Bay, Wash., that &quot;if you fell down and your gun went off, chances are you'd hit a bear,&quot; he says in a rare overstatement.    He didn't plan a career of running hounds. He had &quot;picked brush&quot; for florists and taken two years of wildlife biology in college before dropping out to work in a flour mill. He had trained a few hounds and was hunting bears solely for sport when he was hired for his present job in 1964 by the timber-company group, the Washington Forest Protection Association.    His success in the '60s as a bear hunter because of his skill with dogs became a Northwest legend. &quot;Those dogs were like a machine,&quot; recalls his boss, Mr. Flowers. &quot;When they hit a bear track, that bear was dead.&quot; Mr. Flowers is supervisor of animal-damage control for the protection association.    Mr. Paque made $275 a month and $15 a bear tail at first and enough later to support a wife and two sons. In his best year, including some money made guiding, he made $20,000, taking as many as nine bears in one day. But it was grueling work, especially before he had telemetry collars to find lost or injured dogs. &quot;Bear hunting is hard on wives,&quot; says Karen Sanderlin, his present mother-in-law. &quot;A man stays out all night and comes home and says, 'I slept in the woods waiting for my dogs.' She says, 'Sure.'&quot;    And the job, or perhaps his enthusiasm for it, did partly cost him his marriage of nine years. His present marriage to Robin, a lively woman of 33, is obviously a happy one, but his work worries her. &quot;It used to be that when he came in covered with blood, I'd insist on knowing what happened,&quot; she says. &quot;Then I'd find out he was crawling through the brush and shot a bear at three feet.&quot; She shudders and adds, &quot;I don't ask anymore.&quot;    Mr. Paque, who carries only a revolver, defends such tactics. &quot;When my dogs corner a mean, rank-smelling boar bear, they've got to know I'm going to back them up. And sometimes that means crawling into the bushes to shake hands with that bear.&quot; Once, he recalls, as he raised his .44-caliber revolver, a bear crunched down on the gun -- and on his hand, immobilizing it. He had to wrestle free to pull the trigger.    His transition to guiding hunters hasn't gone smoothly. &quot;Bernie worries about clients not getting game -- he works hard for them,&quot; observes Frank Sanderlin, Mrs. Paque's stepfather, a 235-pound lumberjack.    Mr. Paque collects his $1,750 fee for a six-day mountain-lion hunt whether the hunter gets anything or not. The seven-foot, 135-pound mountain lion in that short pine has been treed for 28 hours waiting for the client, who is overdue from Alaska. Finally, the client arrives and, before moving on to other game, shoots the cougar.    Some hunters, Mr. Paque concedes, would reject such a setup as unsporting. &quot;It depends on the client,&quot; he says, &quot;but few hunters would pass up a full-grown tom like this one.&quot;    Probably Mr. Paque's biggest hurdle to success at guiding is his lack of business instinct. &quot;Bernie's totally honest, and that's fine,&quot; Mr. Flowers says, &quot;but he's too easygoing. Some clients take advantage of him.&quot;    Bears are more numerous than mountain lions, and Mr. Paque guarantees a bear hunter a bear for a $600 fee. But sometimes, after the dogs have cornered a bear some distance away, the client will say the guarantee isn't fulfilled because he is physically unable to climb the rough terrain to shoot the animal. In one case, Mr. Paque says, he treed three bears for a client over three days, providing food and a room -- and didn't collect a fee. &quot;It's disappointing,&quot; he says.    While mountain lions are magnificent animals with powerful bodies, long claws and awesome teeth, Mr. Paque considers them &quot;sissies.&quot; His real love is chasing black bears. &quot;You get in a tree with a bear and he's liable to climb down and whip you,&quot; he says. &quot;Their personalities vary so much you can't tell what one will do.&quot;    That is dramatically demonstrated on a recent fall morning as he guides a bear hunt with this reporter as his client. It is an hour before dawn and Mr. Paque's pickup is chugging slowly along an old timber road. Atop the truck, chained to the hood on a rug, two &quot;strike dogs&quot; -- whose job is to find the first track of the quarry -- sniff the air for a whiff of a bear that has crossed the path. Four more hounds -- the &quot;chase pack&quot; -- whine with excitement in a cage in the truck bed.    A couple of miles away, Mr. Sanderlin drives along another timber road in his truck, which also carries strike dogs and a chase pack. Intermittently, the two compare notes by CB radio.    Suddenly, the two strike hounds on Mr. Paque's truck begin baying wildly and he unchains them. When they race off squalling on a hot trail, he flips open the cage door and the four hounds leap from the truck in full cry.    But this bear is a &quot;runner,&quot; and the five-mile chase leads into an Indian reservation, off limits to whites. Mr. Paque spends the rest of the day following the faint beep of his telemetry wand to recover the scattered hounds.    But his spirits are high. &quot;Tomorrow we hunt the A-team. We've even got the fabulous four,&quot; he says, referring to his fastest and most fearless hounds, which have been resting. As it turns out, their talents are needed. Shortly after dawn, two strike dogs, trying to work out a cold track, cross the fresh trail of another bear and catch up with it after a short chase.    Listening intently to the wild baying of the two dogs, Mr. Paque concludes: &quot;We've got a mean one. He prefers to fight it out with the dogs rather than climb a tree.&quot; He releases four more hounds, which quickly join the battle.    As the hunters approach, the 200-pound male bear slips away unseen in the thick underbrush. The six hounds, squalling and snapping, bring it to bay again a half-mile away in a heavily timbered valley, but it moves as the running men near.    Finally, the bear errs, turning to charge the dogs 50 yards from the hunting party. Two quick slugs from a rifle and the hunt is over.    &quot;Hunting with friends, two rigs and CB radios is fun,&quot; Mr. Paque says. &quot;But when I'm chasing through the woods, just me and the bear and the dogs, now that's a bear hunt.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
