No public comments adverse to EPA's decision were received bythe end of the comment period on May 24, 1989. Therefore, final authorizationfor Minnesota will be effective on June 23, 1989.The April 24, 1989, notice on page 16362, in the first column, inadvertentlyincluded a July 15, 1985, interim status rule amendment, ``Permit Life,''covering 40 Code of Federal Regulations andSection;andSection;270.10 (a), (c),(e); 270.30(j)(2); and 270.70 (a), (c), (d), (e), (f) (50 FR 28702-28755).While the State originally applied for authorization of this amendment,it has since determiend that additional rulemaking would be necessary.Therefore, this notice serves to correct the April 24, 1989, notice byomitting from final authorization the above interim status amendment. TheState will seek authorization for this specific amendment in a future application.EPA also wants to clarify that the State is receiving authorization forcertain minor corrections to some of the rules listed in the April 24,1989, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. Those corrections are as follows: PartB Information Requirements for Disposal Facilities, as amended September9, 1987, (52 FR 33936); Liability Coverage, as amended November 18, 1987,(52 FR 44314-44321); Listing of Spent Solvents, as amended January 21,1986, (51 FR 2702); Small Quantity Generators, as amended October 1, 1986,(51 FR 55190-55194); and, Liquids in Landfills, as amended May 28, 1986,(51 FR 19176).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Effective date:</T2> Final authorization for Minnesota will be effectiveon June 23, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>For further information contact:</T2> Christine Klemme, United StatesEnvironmental Protection Agency, Waste Management Division, Region V, 230South Dearborn, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 886-3715.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Valdas V.
