Exhibiting a sense of timing that could hardly have been more inappropriate if Fidel Castro had planned it himself, the senator's committee narrowly voted to withdraw U.S. military aid from Nicaragua's anti-communist guerrillas. This came at a time when Nicaragua's democratic neighbors, led by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, had just mustered the courage to take a tougher stand toward the heavily armed, Soviet-backed military regime in Managua.    After the vote, the Foreign Relations chairman had the nerve to go before the National Women's Democratic Club in Washington to complain that U.S. foreign policy is in &quot;disarray.&quot; That is indeed true, but not because of any lack of administration coherence. Rather, a small group in Congress totally out of step with the national consensus takes every opportunity to undermine U.S. policy.    The president's goal in Central America has been clearly and repeatedly enunciated: to prevent Nicaragua from becoming another major Soviet military base in this hemisphere. Any legislator who claims he doesn't understand that is either blowing smoke or has been asleep six years. Either one should disqualify him from foreign policy oversight.    The U.S. is applying both military and diplomatic pressure on Managua. Military pressure is exercised through aid, approved last year by Congress, to anti-communist forces. They are fighting a largely conscripted army equipped and trained by Soviet, Cuban and East European military officers. The anti-communists have not done badly, even when their enemies in Congress have succeeded in denying them U.S. aid. But time is not on their side. More Soviet helicopter gunships pour into the country, a new military airfield in the northeast corner moves closer to completion and Soviet-refined police-state measures, such as informers and block committees, are giving the military junta a tighter grip on the Nicaraguan people.    U.S. diplomatic efforts are especially vulnerable to Capitol Hill clumsiness. Nicaragua's democratic neighbors have every reason to be fearful. El Salvador has been under continuous attack from Castro-supported guerrillas for nearly a decade. Honduras already has been invaded at least twice by the Nicaraguan army. Costa Rica, up until Nicaragua became a serious threat, had no military at all, and what it has now is fairly minimal. Yet, with the backing of U.S. diplomats, Costa Rican President Arias recently won agreement for a regional &quot;summit&quot; meeting at Esquipulas, Guatemala, at which it was intended to present Nicaragua's president, Daniel Ortega, with a kind of ultimatum. His neighbors would demand removal of his foreign advisers and fulfillment of his regime's 1979 promise of a pluralistic system.    As Costa Rican political scientist Jaime Daremblum wrote on the page opposite last Friday, such ultimatums will not, in and of themselves, topple the Managuan communists. That is especially true now that Guatemala, under pressure from the Mexican left, is showing signs of cold feet. But the initiative has importance anyway because of its potential for organizing democratic countries in Central America into a united front against a new source of tyranny.    But how could any such effort carry weight with the communists without unequivocal U.S.(backing? And why would anyone in Central America, friend or foe, take any U.S. role seriously when it is being undermined back in Washington by Claiborne Pell and his friends? Indeed, the senator's speech to the Democratic women gives the impression that he thinks the anti-communists, not the communists, are the villains. He called them &quot;our terrorists,&quot; a gross insult to a brave group of fighting men and women who want nothing more than to avoid a totalitarian future.    Sen. Pell, after jerking the rug out from under these people, would put all his chips on the &quot;Contadora&quot; process. The Contadora process has become a joke. In all the years of Contadora &quot;peace&quot; talks, the main accomplishment has been to provide the Sandinistas with a diversion while they pursue their military build-up. Mexico's left, one of the main sponsors of Contadora, no doubt will be happy to see that process continue so long as it succeeds so well at gulling American legislators and European statesmen.    U.S. policy in Central America is indeed in disarray. The blame for that rests with Senator Pell and like-minded senators and congressmen. It is hard at this point to assess what the eventual cost will be. But be certain that it won't be low. </TEXT></DOC>
