A procedure is described using digital subtractionangiography which largely eliminates both factors. The measured intravasculariodine concentration is close to the true value throughout the entireintensifier field and quantitative evaluation is independent of localfactors. The reduction of the artifacts improves diagnostic certaintyduring visual evaluation also.</TEXT></DOC>
