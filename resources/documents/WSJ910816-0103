Before becoming a judge, he was the assistant U.S.attorney who led the government's assault to collect backtaxes from Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. And in 1988 theyoung prosecutor won a $1 billion tax settlement for thegovernment in Texaco Inc.'s bankruptcy-court reorganization.</LP><TEXT>   Now, three weeks after being sworn in as a federalbankruptcy-court judge in Manhattan, the soft-spoken JudgeGarrity is presiding over the far-reaching, scandal-riddencase of BCCI. Still waiting for his name to be painted on thedoor to his chambers, Judge Garrity has become the pivotalfigure in BCCI liquidators' efforts to bar U.S. officialsfrom seizing the company's assets.   From the bench, Judge Garrity has taken a methodical, ifplodding, approach to the complicated case brought by BCCI'sforeign-court appointed liquidators. While seeminglysympathetic to the liquidators' goal of a global solution tothe case, he has taken pains to give the objecting partiesample opportunity to speak up. At a hearing last week, heseemed to be taking roll call as he polled each opponent ofthe liquidators' efforts before ruling.   Judge Garrity's steady, earnest style during the six-hourhearing seemed to calm the passions that the BCCI liquidatorshad evoked. At the end of the hearing, all the sides agreedto extend for eight weeks a restraining order sought by theliquidators.   &quot;Perhaps it is the kind of challenge that quickly teststhe mettle of a judge,&quot; said Arthur Olick, a partner atAnderson Kill Olick andamp; Oshinsky, where Judge Garrity went towork after law school in 1980. &quot;I'm confident he'll meet thechallenge and become one of our best judicial leaders.&quot;   Judge Garrity was selected for the bankruptcy judge'spost, a $115,092-a-year job, from 40 applicants earlier thisyear. &quot;It wasn't a particularly close call,&quot; said StevenFlanders, circuit executive of the Second U.S. Circuit Courtof Appeals in Manhattan. &quot;He was universally recommended bythe bankruptcy judges.&quot; Unlike federal district judges,bankruptcy-court judges are appointed to a 14-year term bythe federal appeals court in which they serve.   &quot;Jimmy&quot; Garrity, born in Teaneck, N.J., comes from afamily that friends say prides itself on public service. Hisfather, a lawyer in Manhattan, often serves as a trustee orexaminer in bankruptcy cases and recently retired as anadjunct professor of law at St. John's University. JudgeGarrity's uncle, U.S. Judge W. Arthur Garrity, ordered Bostonto desegregate its schools in 1974 in a fight over busing,and his grandfather was a federal magistrate judge inMassachusetts.   Friends and former colleagues say Judge Garrity isindefatigible, a college soccer and lacrosse star who stillstays in shape. Judge Garrity, who comes from a family ofnine children, was married last year.   Judge Garrity graduated with a bachelor's degree ineconomics from College of the Holy Cross in 1977 and thenreceived his law degree in 1980 from St. John's University,where he won an award for excellence in admiralty law. Whilepracticing at Anderson Kill, he followed his father'sfootsteps and got a master's degree in taxation from New YorkUniversity.   Mr. Olick said Judge Garrity was a success during his sixyears at Anderson Kill, where he represented debtors andcreditors in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law cases. But Mr. Olickencouraged the young lawyer to join the U.S. attorney'soffice, where Mr. Olick had served as chief of the civildivision 15 years before.   Through his work at the U.S. attorney's office, JudgeGarrity became a familiar face in bankruptcy court. FromOctober 1986 until last November, he was the government'slead attorney in 1,500 bankruptcy-court cases, appearingbefore the court's judges almost every day for five years.   &quot;The bankruptcy judges before whom he appeared uniformlyraved about his performance in court,&quot; said Benito Romano,former acting U.S. attorney and Judge Garrity's ex-boss. From1988 until he left the U.S. attorney's office this year, hewas chief of the civil division's tax unit.   Harvey Miller, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York lawfirm of Weil, Gotshal andamp; Manges, said Judge Garrity filled hisrole at the U.S. attorney's office &quot;in a way that wasrefreshing. . . . He looked for solutions, rather thansaying, `We're the government and we make the rules.' &quot; Mr.Miller, who represented Texaco in its bankruptcy case and nowis representing a creditor of BCCI, said Judge Garrity &quot;hasgone through the crucible&quot; as the government's lawyer inseveral high-profile cases.   But the BCCI case, filed under a bankruptcy law thatprotects a company's assets in the U.S. while it is beingliquidated abroad, will take Judge Garrity into someuncharted territory. The case pits bankruptcy laws againstbanking regulations, and U.S. regulators against the effortsof foreign courts -- all before a backdrop of internationalintrigue and political scandal.   &quot;The banking statutes and bankruptcy statutes don'tharmonize, they collide,&quot; said Hugh Ray, a bankruptcyattorney at the Houston law firm of Andrews andamp; Kurth. &quot;Thereare no clear precedents in this area. . . . He's going to bemaking law more than he's going to be interpreting it.&quot;   Judge Garrity declined to be interviewed. But in hisapplication for the judge's spot, he said that an internshipwith a bankruptcy judge during his third year of law school&quot;taught me that bankruptcy practice is as diverse as it isdynamic and convinced me to make a career in the practice ofbankruptcy law.&quot;   &quot;I think this is something he's ready for,&quot; said Mr.Romano, referring to the BCCI matter. &quot;It will be achallenge, but it is something that would be a challenge forany judge. He keeps a cool head, and he'll maintain control.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
