(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   If fallen evangelist Jimmy Swaggartfails to quickly reverse his defiance and accept a year-long bar onpreaching and television appearances demanded by the Assemblies ofGod, the church will move to dismiss him, officials say.   Swaggart, whose worldwide ministry is scrambling to overcomefinancial problems, has said he will defy the church order andpreach again on May 22, only three months after he confessed tounspecified sins.   A rift between the church's leaders over how to disciplineSwaggart was settled Friday when the Louisiana District Councilannounced it would not contest stern sanctions ordered by theAssemblies' General Presbytery.   The church's General Presbytery, meeting at its nationalheadquarters in Springfield, Mo., on Tuesday banned Swaggart fromthe pulpit for at least a year for ``moral failure'' thatreportedly included hiring a prostitute to pose nude.   On Friday, Louisiana church officials said they would go alongwith the order despite their own recommendation that Swaggart bebarred from preaching for only three months.   ``I would hope he would see the wisdom of submitting himself tothe judgment of his brothers because there is a strong desire ...to be helpful to the man,'' said the Rev. Thomas Zimmerman, theAssemblies' retired general superintendent.   On Feb. 21, Swaggart tearfully confessed to unspecified sins andstepped down from the pulpit.   On Wednesday, he announced through his attorney that he wouldreturn to the pulpit May 22 _ the end of the three-month suspensionrecommended by the state council _ in defiance of the nationalleadership.   ``What was said at the Wednesday press conference still holds,''Swaggart spokesman Gus Weill said Friday. ``Reverend Swaggart isstill planning to return to the pulpit May 22 and we're stillexamining the rights to appeal.''   Church bylaws, however, do not allow ministers to appealrehabilitation decisions, said Juleen Turnage, a spokeswoman at theAssemblies' national headquarters.   ``If they haven't heard from him (Swaggart) in a few days, areasonable period of time, they'll assume he is rejecting theiroffer. In that case, they would move immediately to dismiss him,''she said.   The national office expected to hear from Swaggart on Monday,Mrs. Turnage said.   Swaggart's ministry is not controlled by the Assemblies of God.Officials have said the credentials of the organization's ministersare the only direct link with the Assemblies, the nation's largestPentecostal denomination.   Bill Treeby, Swaggart's lawyer, said lack of denominationcredentials would not affect the ministry's operations.   Television appears to be the lifeline for Swaggart's ministry,which includes worldwide missionary and hospital programs, a Biblecollege and a worship center that seats 5,000.   Ratings from the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed Swaggart's averageviewership dropped from more than 1 million households in November1986 to 860,000 homes a year later as he lost his position as themost-watched TV preacher.   Swaggart's ministry conducted a telethon in mid-March in whichthe evangelist's wife Frances and son Donnie warned that manyprograms faced cancellation. Ministry officials have refused toreveal how much money was raised through the telethon.   The March issue of the ministry's magazine, The Evangelist, saidthe organization faced a $14.7 million deficit through February,before the sex scandal surfaced. The magazine's April edition wasabout half the size of those published in previous months.   The ministry's bank account was overdrawn by $2 million,Swaggart said in a March 19 appeal for funds sent to supporters.   The organization recently mortgaged more than 100 acres ofproperty to cover a suspended connstruction project and to secure a$20 million line of credit.   Swaggart's ministry has contributed between $10.3 million and$11.4 million annually over the past three years to the Assemblies'foreign missions program, Turnage said.   ``There have been indications that a number of people sendingmoney to individual organizations ... will now send through thechurch where there is accountability and they know what the moneyis used for,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
