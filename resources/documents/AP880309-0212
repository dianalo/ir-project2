In Budapest, Hungary, a PLO official said the bus attack was notaimed at taking hostages but at entering the Dimona nuclearfacility in Israel's Negev desert.   Three Israeli civilians were killed in the Monday hijacking,which was later claimed by the Palestine Liberation Organization.   The three guerrillas were killed when Israeli police stormed thebus, which was filled with workers headed to the Dimona plant.   The military command confirmed that Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, thearmy chief of staff, was investigating the hijacking, but itrefused to provide any details.   Before commandeering the bus, the guerrillas managed to seize acar containing four unarmed army officers, drive past policesetting up a roadblock, keep ahead of a police van during aneight-mile chase, shoot at passing cars and hijack the bus whilepolice looked on helplessly.   Shomron said Monday that if the officers had been armed, theymight have prevented the attack. Their commander, Col. ZeevZachrin, sentenced each of the officers to 35 days in jail forignoring orders to carry their weapons outside the base.   The daily Davar reported that Shomron was considering orderingall officers to carry their weapons at all times anywhere in Israel.   Police Minister Chaim Bar Lev defended police conduct in thehijacking. The Israeli news agency Itim quoted him as sayingofficers chasing the guerrillas could not fire at will becausethere were passenger cars on the highway.   The daily Haaretz said the police, who carried Israeli-made Uzisubmachine guns, were outgunned by the guerrillas who used KarlGustav and Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifles which have a longerrange.   The police managed to shoot a hole in the tire of the seizedcar, Haaretz reported. The police parked their van 20 yards awayfrom the abandoned car and rushed for cover while the guerrillaskept firing in all directions.   Nearby, the driver of a bus carrying workers to the nuclearplant heard the shooting and opened his doors to let the passengersget away. Police stopped shooting as the passengers rushed out,Haaretz reported.   The guerrillas took over the bus, where 11 passengers remainedtrapped. Survivors later testified the guerrillas killed at leasttwo of the hostages. The army is still investigating whether policeor guerrillas shot the third victim.   Hekmat Zaid, chief of the PLO mission in Budapest, toldreporters Wednesday, ``The aim of the Palestinian commando action... was not to take hostages, the plan of the PLO's armed men wasto enter the strictly guarded complex by overpowering the bus thatcarried the workers of the Dimona nuclear center.''   Zaid said the attack was ``only aimed against workers in amilitary establishment, an action against the Israeli enemy,''adding ``the fact is Israel refuses international supervision overits Negev nuclear station.''   ``We will increase our military action against Israel,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
