Autoradiography with{alpha}-sensitive nuclear emulsions was utilized for determining radioctivitydistributions and for localizing radioactive minerals, in combinationwith microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, PIXE and eletron microprobe analysisfor its identification. Mineralized gneisse and feldspatic rock, thetwo principal samples studied, show distinct differences in radioactivedistribution patterns, however the main carriers for U and Th seem tobe the same. Microanalysis shows that elements are associated with Si,Ca, Fe and Al an some trace elements like Y, Zr, Ti, etc. U and Th aredistributed uniformly in feldspatic rock and inhomogeneously in mineralizedgneisse, indicating that the zonary structure of the radioactive cristals,frequently observed in gneisse, could be due to variable U:Th ratios.Chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction datas and microscopic studies indicatesthat the principal carrier for radioactivity in the rocks of Espinharasis a silicate mineral of U and Th, probably situaded in the series oftransition: Coffinite -andgt; uraninite, thorogummite -andgt; thorianite. Someadditional experiments about leachability of uranium with diluted sulfuricacid are reported, which confirm the different nature of radioactivitydistribution in feldspatic and gneissic rocks.</TEXT></DOC>
