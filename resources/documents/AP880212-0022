No one was injured and damage to the two ships was described aslight.   But the administration immediately lodged a strong protest withthe Soviet ambassador here, saying the vessels had done nothingprovocative and were operating in accord with international law.   ``As Secretary of State (George P.) Shultz said just a week ago,we are prepared to deal with the best and worst of Sovietbehavior,'' said Rudolph Boone, a State Department spokesman.   ``We intend to continue exercising our rights underinternational law. The Soviets are obligated to comply with theirinternational commitments.''   Navy officials said during a Pentagon briefing there was noquestion that the cruiser USS Yorktown and destroyer USS Caron hadbeen struck deliberately by a Soviet frigate and a smaller coastalpatrol boat, respectively.   The Soviet warships broadcast a warning beforehand, saying theywere authorized ``to strike your ship with one of ours,'' saidCapt. Gerry Flynn, a top aide to the chief of naval operations.   The two Soviet ships then closed almost simultaneously on theAmerican vessels, ``which were, as we would say in the Navy,shouldered out of the way,'' Flynn added.   The Yorktown and Caron maintained their course and speed despitethe bumping, eventually steaming farther from the Soviet coast,Flynn said.   ``The latest report I have now is that both ships are operatingroutinely in the Black Sea as planned,'' he said.   Flynn and other Pentagon officials said they could not recall asimilar incident of deliberate bumping during operations in theBlack Sea. The Soviets strongly protested a similar deployment bythe same two ships in March 1986, but did nothing at the time tophysically interfere with their passage.   The Soviet Union claimed Friday the U.S. Navy ships violated itsborder, ignored warnings ``and dangerously maneuvered in Sovietterritorial waters.''   ``It was a routine passage and we were doing nothing provocativeat all ...,'' Flynn countered. ``We view (this) with considerableconcern.''   According to Cmdr. Richard Schiff, a Navy lawyer who appearedwith Flynn, the Yorktown and Caron were operating off the Crimeanpeninsula in what the Navy calls its ``assertion of rights''program _ an effort to periodically steam through contested watersto emphasize freedom of navigation on the high seas.   Unlike the United States, which claims a three-mile territoriallimit, the Soviet Union claims a 12-mile limit along its coast,Schiff explained. The United States will accept such a claim, butany country claiming 12 miles ``must allow for innocent passage bythe ships of all nations,'' he said.   The Soviet Union tries to insist that foreign ships stick tospecified sea lanes when making an innocent passage, something ithas no right to do, the lawyer said.   ``So what our ships were doing there was exercising that rightof innocent passage,'' Schiff said. He noted that Sovietintelligence-gathering ships routinely operate within five miles ofthe U.S. coastline.   According to the Pentagon, Friday's incident began with theYorktown and Caron steaming eastward, parallel to each other andabout three miles apart, past the Crimean peninsula. The Caron wasabout seven miles off the shoreline and the Yorktown about 10.   The two ships had been shadowed by three Soviet vessels andSoviet reconnaissance aircraft ever since entering the Black Seathrough the Turkish Straits on Wednesday.   At about 11 a.m. local time Friday _ or 3 a.m. EST _ Flynn saidthe Soviets broadcast the following warning to the U.S. ships:``Soviet ships have orders to prevent violation of territorialwaters. I am authorized to strike your ship with one of ours.''   The Caron responded: ``I am engaged in innocent passage,consistent with international law.''   When neither the Caron or Yorktown changed course, aKrivak-class frigate moved up on the Yorktown and a Mirka-classpatrol vessel moved on the Caron, ``grazing'' the left sides of theeach, Flynn said.   American naval forays into the Black Sea _ each of which must beapproved by the president _ are normally ordered at least once ayear for two reasons, said Pentagon officials who asked not to benamed.   The Navy ships are expected to monitor Soviet militaryoperations, frequently employing electronic listening gear, and toassert the right of U.S. warships to navigate through those waters.   The Soviet Union considers the Black Sea as its own ``lake'' _even though it is only one of several nations bordering the sea'swaters _ and maintains a large naval fleet there.   According to Boone, Undersecretary of State Michael Armacostcalled in Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin Friday morning to ``lodgea strong protest.''   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, who is scheduled to meetwith his Soviet counterpart next month, also intends to protest theRussian action, Boone said.</TEXT></DOC>
