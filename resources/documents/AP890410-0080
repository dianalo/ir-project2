The decision by North and his defense lawyers was probablypredetermined by the nature of the charges against the formerMarine lieutenant colonel and his proven abilities as a witness.   ``Because of his centrality to the entire case ... Ollie North,you almost might say, really could not not testify because of whohe is and what he is'' said Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorneyin the nation's capital.   A charismatic speaker whose voice often cracked during emotionalpoints in his story, North won a wide national following when hetestified for six days in 1987 during televised congressionalhearings on the Iran-Contra affair. He appeared as a sympatheticand forceful defender of his actions.   Eliciting that sympathy from the jury which will decide his fateis a crucial task for the defense. North was probably the bestwitness to make his case that he was acting with the full supportand authority of his superiors, including President Reagan.   ``I felt like a pawn in a chess game being played by giants,''he told the jury, explaining why he felt a duty to lie to Congressabout secret U.S. military aid to the Nicaraguan Contras at a timewhich such aid was illegal.   North said he didn't think it was wrong to lie because he wasconcealing activities that ``I was told, could not, should not berevealed.''   But after telling his side for three days from witness stand,North faced the obvious risks Monday as associate independentcounsel John W. Keker began cross-examination.   Weighing the gains versus the losses that a skilled prosecutorcan exact on cross-examination is the dilemma all defense attorneysface in a criminal trial.   The defendant must answer all questions put to him, and askilled prosecutor could bring out damaging admissions from adefendant. Cross-examination can thus give the prosecution anopportunity to shore up weak parts of its case by adding to proofnot available from other sources.   ``The normal rule is you do not want your client to testify. Aclient can hurt himself more than he can help himself,'' saidWashington defense lawyer E. Lawrence Barcella.   But Barcella said the rule ``is filled with exceptions'' thatmay well include the North case.   ``A lot of times a call whether or not to take that risk isbased upon how you are doing by the end of the government's case... and your gut feeling as to how risky it is for this defendantto take the stand,'' said Randall J. Turk, another Washingtondefense lawyer.   Turk faced that dilemma when he helped defend former White Houseaide Michael K. Deaver, who was convicted of lying under oath abouthis lobbying activities. Deaver did not testify at his trial.   Nor did Lyn Nofziger, a former White House aide convicted ofethics-law violations who was represented by Barcella.   But in some white-collar criminal cases, ``sometimes it'sobvious you have to call the defendant,'' Turk says.   ``So much of what's going on in a white-collar crime case arequestions of a person's honesty and integrity,'' Turk said.``Usually the cases involve the gray area between something that isclearly right and clearly wrong.''   ``The real issue in the cases is the intent of the defendant,''Turk said. ``The jury is usually very interested in hearing fromthe defendant so they can make an assessment.''   Barcella said one factor is often whether a defense can be builtfrom other witnesses.   ``In this particular case, there isn't anybody who can reallyexplain it as well as he can,'' said Barcella. ``There are a numberof counts he can't really get anybody else to help him with.''   These include a charge North accepted installation of a $13,800security fence outside his Great Falls, Va., home in violation of alaw that bars federal employees from accepting gratuities.   North told jurors that he sought help from arms-dealer RichardV. Secord when federal officials declined to give his familyprotection in 1986 after a terrorist group targeted him as an enemy.   ``The bottom line of the discussion was that `there isn't a lotwe can do for you; you are too junior,''' North told jurors.   ``I intended to pay for it,'' he said, but acknowledged, ``I didnot.''   While Barcella said he found North ``a very persuasive andconvincing witness'' before Congress, the courtroom setting is verydifferent.   On Capitol Hill, Barcella said, ``nobody really took control ofNorth and shut him down'' when he gave rambling answers.   ``Once he started looking like a fairly sympathetic figure, forpolitical reasons, none of the congressmen or senators reallywanted to jump in his face,'' Barcella said.   That won't be the case at his trial, which is under the tightcontrol of U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.   ``Judge Gesell controls the courtroom,'' Barcella said. ``Thejury isn't going to hold against the government what Judge Geselldoes to control Oliver North.''</TEXT><NOTE>____</NOTE><NOTE>EDITORS' NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   James Rowley, who followed the Iran-Contrainvestigation at the U.S. Courthouse from 1987 to 1989, covers theJustice Department for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
