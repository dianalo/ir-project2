(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eating breakfast may be good for one'shealth, but using a photo of a snoozing President Reagan to makethe point is risky business, a fast food chain learned.   Full-page ads featuring the photo were pulled from fivenewspapers this week after the Burgerville chain received dozens ofcalls from people who thought they made fun of Reagan, said PatKlinger, vice president of Burgerville USA's parent company,Holland Inc.   The ads depicted the president with his eyes closed and wearingheadphones. The picture, obtained from NBC-TV, was taken whenReagan was attending a meeting at Bonn, West Germany.   ``You can usually tell when someone skips breakfast,'' said theads, which extolled the nutritional benefits of a breakfast likethose available at Burgerville.   Twenty-five calls was all it took, said Klinger, who yanked thead after a one-day run in the Columbian in Vancouver, the Oregonianin Portland, the Salem, Ore., Statesman-Journal and the Dalles,Ore., Chronicle.   Klinger managed to stop the ad before it ran in the weeklyMonmouth, Ore., Sun-Enterprise.   Burgerville, with 31 outlets in Oregon and Washington, oftenuses eye-catching advertisements to compete with nationalrestaurant chains, but Klinger said there were limits to theattention he hoped to draw.   ``We're not in the business of offending or upsetting people,''he said. ``The ad became something we didn't intend. It became apolitical ad and we pulled it.''   Ron Rasmussen was one of those newspaper readers who got upset.   ``I was so mad, I could've spit bullets,'' said the former ClarkCounty Republican chairman. ``It was extremely discourteous to ourpresident to put that ad in. I'm 58, and I could fall asleep in ameeting.''</TEXT></DOC>
