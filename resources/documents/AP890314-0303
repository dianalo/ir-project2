Automakers said they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of31,090 during the March 1-10 period this year, compared with a dailyrate of 36,493 a year earlier.   Car sales were down by 18.5 percent during the early March periodcompared with last year and truck sales were down 8 percent. Each ofthe Big Three reported declines in domestic car sales rates, withChrysler Corp. sales dropping 35.9 percent, Ford Motor Co. falling21.4 percent and General Motors Corp. declining 13.4 percent.   Analysts speculated that sales were dampened by comparison withstrong results in the year-earlier period and by rising interestrates that may finally be slowing consumer spending.   ``That has to cut into the family's disposable income and maybethey're thinking maybe let the old buggy do longer,'' said analystMary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. of New York.   Interest rates have been rising in recent months, partly becauseof a credit squeeze engineered by the Federal Reserve to sloweconomic activity and thus curb inflation. The prime lending rate _the bank lending rate used as a benchmark for many types of consumerloans _ is 11.5 percent, compared with 8.5 percent a year earlier.   Analysts said automakers were waiting for traditionally goodearly spring buying to start. March and April sales traditionallyhave reduced automakers' inventories, which are hovering around the80-day level.   According to Ward's Automotive Reports, the combined inventoryamong the U.S.-based automakers is at its highest level in 19 months.   Each of the Big Three recently boosted incentive offers in aneffort to stimulate sales and GM temporarily has halted productionat two plants to reduce inventory.   For the year through March 10, car and light truck sales by theU.S.-based makers were down 6.9 percent from last year's pace,falling to a daily rate of 33,838 vehicles from 36,330 last year.Car sales were down 9.7 percent and truck sales were down by 1.7percent.   Chrysler sold cars at a daily rate of 2,471 in early March thisyear, down from the 3,852 daily rate in the year-earlier period.Chrysler's car sales were down 21.4 percent on a year-to-yearcomparison.   Chrysler's light trucks sales were 8.5 percent lower for theperiod and up 3.5 percent for the year.   Ford said its car sales during early March fell to a daily rateof 6,012 in 1989 from a 7,651 rate during the period last year. Forthe year, Ford's car sales were 3.3 percent lower than last year'srate.   Ford truck sales were down 20.6 percent in early March from thesame period last year and were off 3.5 percent for the year to date.
