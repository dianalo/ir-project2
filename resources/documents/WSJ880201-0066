After two days of deliberations, the jury deadlocked at 7-to-5. Because the judge in the case instructed jurors not to discuss it, it wasn't known which side the majority favored.    But legal specialists said that if the plaintiffs couldn't win a clear victory in this case, there could be little hope of a verdict against a tobacco company in any of the other 125 or so tobacco liability suits brought by sick smokers or their families. The Mississippi case had been viewed as the strongest brought by a plaintiff in litigation against tobacco companies.    Such litigation, said Victor Schwartz, a Washington, D.C., specialist in product-liability law, &quot;is a patient on life support.&quot;    Securities analysts said the mistrial could continue to fuel support for tobacco company stock prices, although they also said other litigation against the companies will weigh on investor thinking this year.    On Friday, as rumors of the jury deadlock spread, some tobacco company stocks rallied. RJR Nabisco Inc. closed at $47.125, up $2.125 a share, and Philip Morris Cos. at $86.75, up $3.625 a share. But American Brands fell by $1.125 a share to $46.75.    The case against American Tobacco was brought by the family of Nathan Horton, a building contractor who died a year ago of inoperable lung cancer. Mr. Horton had smoked two packs of cigarettes a day since he was a teenager. His favorite brand was Pall Mall, made by American Tobacco, a unit of Old Greenwich Conn.-based American Brands.    American Tobacco denied responsibility for Mr. Horton's death. Smoking is a matter of personal choice, its lawyers told the jury, and smokers are fully aware of the risks associated with the habit.    Don Barrett, the Hortons' lawyer, vowed Friday to try the case again before another jury. &quot;We'll be back,&quot; he said. &quot;We're saddened and disappointed, but this case isn't over yet. We will file immediately for a new trial.&quot; Still, he said, trying the case again &quot;would be like giving birth to the same baby twice.&quot;    Anti-smoking forces had high hopes for the Horton case. Mississippi state law is more favorable to plaintiffs than in most other states. Under its so-called comparative-negligence law, the jury could have awarded damages to the Horton family even if it had found the tobacco company bore only one percent of the responsibility for Mr. Horton's death.    &quot;You guys couldn't even convince nine people that we were just one percent at fault,&quot; James Upshaw, a lawyer for American Tobacco, shouted during a heated confrontation with an anti-smoking activist on the lawn of the courthouse after the mistrial was declared. &quot;This was a case you said you couldn't lose. Well, admit it. You guys just lost.&quot;    Other litigation against tobacco companies continues this week. Today, trial is scheduled to begin in a case brought against three tobacco companies by the family of Rose Cipollone. Mrs. Cipollone, of Little Ferry, N.J., died at age 58 from lung cancer allegedly caused by smoking. Although pretrial rulings have narrowed the scope of the suit, once seen as a strong one for anti-tobacco litigators, evidence introduced in the trial could prove damaging to tobacco companies.    ---   Alix M.
