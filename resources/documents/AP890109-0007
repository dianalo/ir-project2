Fund experts see a possibility that James M. Baker III,designated as secretary of state by President-elect Bush, willsingle out favored countries as trading partners instead ofpromoting U.S. trade with the whole world.   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, whosemembers include the governments of the major industrial countries,says farm subsidies cost consumers and taxpayers $185 billion a yearbetween 1984 and 1986. The biggest costs are in the United States,western Europe and Japan.   The IMF report cites a speech last year by Baker, then secretaryof the treasury. Baker spoke of what the U.S. government would do ifthere were a failure of the trade talks now being held byrepresentatives of 96 countries.   ``We might be willing to explore a `market liberalization club'approach, through mini-lateral arrangements or a series of bilateralagreements,'' Bush was quoted as saying.   Bilateral agreements are like the new one between the UnitedStates and Canada, freeing up trade between two countries buttending to freeze out others. A similar deal with Israel was madeearlier last year. A ``mini-lateral'' arrangement includes not justtwo but a group of countries, like the 12 in the European EconomicCommunity.   Groups of this kind encourage trade among members at the expenseof those outside the club.   The report was written before last month's meeting in Montreal ofrepresentatives from the 96 governments. They agreed on how tonegotiate 11 different kinds of trade issues in the remaining twoyears of talks. But they failed to agree on four others, includingagriculture.   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter insisted that othergovernments, especially the Europeans, promise to join in along-term phase-out of subsidies before he would talk about cuttingthem in the immediate future. Bush has picked Yeutter as hissecretary of agriculture.   On Thursday Alan Holmer, Yeutter's deputy as traderepresentative, said he was optimistic about agreement being reachedon farm issues by April, a new deadline set at Montreal. Butnegotiations are being soured by a fight between the Europeancommunity and the Reagan administration over the hormones that U.S.farmers use to make their cattle grow faster.   Last Sunday the community, which tries to keep its own farmersfrom using hormones, banned imports of U.S. beef and veal worth over$100 million a year. The Reagan administration retaliated withincreases of 100 percent in import duties on such items as Danishhams and sun-dried tomatoes from Italy, a measure designed to makethem too expensive for Americans to want to buy. The Europeans arethreatening a counter-reprisal and U.S. officials say they have alist ready should that happen.   A truce is in effect at least until Jan. 23, when ministers offoreign affairs from the 12 countries are due to meet in Brussels.Bush will have been inaugurated three days earlier and the newadministration may have some ideas for getting the talks back on therails. Yeutter is to be replaced as trade representative by CarlaHills.   The report published by the International Monetary Fund is called``Issues and Developments in International Trade Policy.'' It waswritten by a team under Margaret Kelly, an Australian who heads thefund's Trade and Payments Division.   The fund is owned by 151 countries, with the United Statesholding the biggest block of votes.</TEXT></DOC>
