SullivanandM;Two networking companies hope to spur the movement of high-speed FDDI LANstoward the desktop this week when they propose a standard for running100M-bps networks over twisted-pair wiring.andM;At the American National Standards Institute meeting in Wichita, Kan.,andO;SynOptics Communications Inc. and Chipcom Corp. will present separateadaptations of 100M-bps Fiber Distributed Data Interface technology designedto run over the widely installed twisted-pair wiring.andP;  Currently, FDDInetworks require fiber-optic cabling, for which installation and hardware aremore costly.andM;The new technology could accelerate the use of FDDI by lowering the cost ofboth the media and the PC network hardware, said Steve Diamond, marketingmanager for SynOptics in Mountain View, Calif.andM;Market researchers at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., estimatethe cost for installing an FDDI network at $11,650 per node, including LANadapter, hub, cabling and connector.andP;  Officials at Chipcom, of Southboro,Mass., expect that cost to drop to about $2,000 once products that usetwisted-pair connections are available -- possibly in as few as nine months.andM;Both firms' technology involves replacing the fiber-optic transceiver used instandard FDDI networks with a twisted-pair transceiver that uses FDDI'stoken-passing protocol and supports its 100M-bps transmission speed.andO;SynOptics is proposing the technology for shielded twisted-pair, whileChipcom says its offering will also work with inexpensive unshieldedtwisted-pair.andM;Using twisted-pair wire with FDDI has several potential drawbacks, analystssaid.andP;  Fiber is more robust, provides greater security and allows distancesof up to 2 kilometers between hubs, said Dave Perro, an industry analyst withmarket researcher Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, Calif.andM;Shielded twisted-pair can transmit over distances of up to 100 meters, whileunshielded twisted-pair spans up to 50 meters.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
