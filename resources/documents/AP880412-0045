(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The first state law in the nation to banthe sale of cheap handguns known as Saturday Night Specials clearedthe General Assembly and was sent to the governor, who has promisedto sign it.   Despite a fierce lobbying effort by the National RifleAssociation, the bill was passed Monday night with support from topstate officials and Sarah Brady, wife of James Brady, PresidentReagan's press secretary.   Mrs. Brady told legislators at an earlier hearing that a $29handgun that would be banned under the Maryland law was used byJohn Hinckley in his 1981 assassination attempt that wounded thepresident and left husband partially disabled.   Democratic House Speaker R. Clayton Mitchell said the 95-41 votein the House of Delegates a few hours before the 1988 legislativesession ended ``seems to be a first, a giant step forward.''   ``I'm hoping Congress will look at what Maryland did,'' saidAttorney General J. Joseph Curran.``That's where this action isneeded.   ``It's been a long time but unfortunately it seems like as thelist of victims grows'' it becomes easier to pass gun controllegislation, he said.   Gov. William Donald Schaefer, who helped move the bill throughthe legislature, said he will sign it into law unless he finds someunexpected legal flaws.   NRA lobbyists gave up their fight after watching the bill sailthrough the Senate on a 35-10 vote Saturday, but Charles H.Cunningham, state liaison for the association, said he will be backto renew the fight next year.   ``I just hope it's not a trend-setting thing where a lot ofstates start setting up boards,'' Cunningham said after the Senatevote.   The bill directs the governor to create a state Handgun RosterBoard headed by the state police superintendent. The nine-memberboard will prepare a list of guns that can be sold in Maryland andwill be required to withhold approval of:   _Guns that are inaccurate, poorly made, easily concealed andmanufactured of cheap materials, characteristics common to theSaturday Night Specials said to be used by drug pushers and othersmall-time criminals.   _Guns made mostly of plastic or ceramic materials that can't bereadily detected by security systems at airports and publicbuildings.   _Guns in which the manufacturer's serial number has beenobliterated or altered.   The bill prohibits manufacturers, dealers and privateindividuals from selling any guns not on the list, and providesfines from $2,500 to $10,000 for violations. It will only beillegal to sell the weapons, not to own them.   ``We shifted the burden of proof. We put the onus on gunmerchants to justify their guns,'' said state Sen. Howard Denis,Republican.   Four states, Illinois, Hawaii, South Carolina and Minnesota,have laws that ban guns based on the melting point of the metal,according to the lobbying group Handgun Control Inc. Guns withlower melting points are of poorer quality and thus cheaper.   However, both the NRA and Handgun Control agreed that no statehas a law regulating guns on the basis of inaccuracy, ease ofconcealment, plastic or ceramic construction or the othercharacteristics addressed by the Maryland law.   ``Clearly, this is going to add some impetus to other statesconsidering gun control laws. This is an example we'll be taking toother states,'' said Michael Beard, executive director of theNational Coalition to Ban Handguns.   The ban on sale of Saturday Night Specials won't take effectuntil Jan. 1, 1990. The board will be required to prepare a list ofapproved guns by July 1, 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
