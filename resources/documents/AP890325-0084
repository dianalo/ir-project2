LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   IBM's decision to advise employees to stay offU.S. airlines because of a hijack warning will be examined verycarefully by other companies, the head of Britain's largestbusiness organization said Saturday.   International Business Machines Corp., the U.S. computer giant,said Friday it had notified employees to avoid traveling on U.S.air carriers from Europe and the Middle East until the end of Aprilbecause of a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration warning of apossible hijacking in Europe.   ``When IBM decides there is something to be concerned about,other companies will look at it very carefully _ as they should,because IBM has an enviable management record,'' said John Banham,director general of the Confederation of British Industry, whichrepresents 250,000 businesses.   Banham said companies that had a lot of employees travelingaround the world would have to make their own decisions on whetherto take similar action.   ``It's worth remembering that IBM must have more people in theair at any one time than almost any other company, so they have aparticularly acute problem,'' he said.   IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., employs nearly 164,000 peopleoutside the United States.   Michael Mates, chairman of the House of Commons select committeeon defense and a member of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher'sgoverning Conservative Party, said the IBM decision could have aworldwide ``snowball effect.''   Mates said he could not blame IBM management because the warninghad been made public and the company might have been open to legalaction in the United States if it had not taken precautions toprotect its staff.   ``But, of course, the consequences of a firm of this size takingaction like this could have a snowball effect all around theworld,'' he said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.   News of the hijack warning was first reported in Britain's DailyExpress newspaper. The FAA then confirmed Thursday it had issued asecurity bulletin to airports and carriers on March 16 about ``thepossibility of a hijacking of a U.S. airliner in Western Europe.''   Mates said publicizing warnings to airlines opened the door to``every nutcase in the world'' to telephone an airline with athreat.   At Britain's airports, travelers faced delays of up to fourhours because of stringent security checks and air trafficrestrictions, but many flights were taking off less than an hourbehind schedule.   ``People appear to be turning up an extra half-hour early and Ican't see as many portable cassette recorders, which should speedthings up,'' said Gatwick Airport duty manager John Lyons.   Investigators have said the bomb that blew up Pan Am flight 103over Lockerbie, Scotland Dec. 21 was concealed in a radio-cassetterecorder. All 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 were killed alongwith 11 people on the ground.</TEXT></DOC>
