Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok said the recently createdCommittee for the Defense of Democracy was barred from ``performingany activities or acts whatsoever.''   Police, meanwhile, issued a separate order banning a Sundayrally in Cape Town that was to mark National Detainees Day.   Tutu, who heads the Committee for the Defense of Democracy andwho planned to attend the rally, said clergymen instead would holda church service at St. George's Cathedral in Cape Town. Similarchurch services are scheduled in four other cities.   ``We are dealing with a vicious government that will nottolerate any opposition to its evil and immoral policies,'' Tututold a news conference. ``They have banned a committee even beforeit has started operating.''   Tutu's group was set up following the government's Feb. 24crackdown on black-led opposition groups. In that crackdown, thegovernment banned 18 anti-apartheid organizations fromparticipating in politics.   The Committee for the Defense of Democracy is led by severalchurch leaders, including Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel PeacePrize, and Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance ofReformed Churches. The clergymen said the group would attempt totake over some the activities previously carried out by therestricted organizations.   However, Vlok's latest order places the same restrictions onTutu's group as the other anti-apartheid groups.   ``Certain clergy are becoming more and more involved inpreaching revolution instead of the true Christian message,'' Vloksaid in a statement.   Vlok accused church leaders of promoting the aims of theoutlawed African National Congress, which wages a bombing andsabotage campaign in a bid to overthrow the white-led government.   He cited a March 1 broadcast by ANC's Radio Freedom which calledfor the church in South Africa to take a more active role inopposing the government.   ``The ANC is currently waging a desperate attempt to extend therevolutionary onslaught and is aiming this attack more and more atthe churches and the whites,'' Vlok said.   ``The church (should) direct itself to the spiritual area andthe government can rely on its prayers to solve the difficultpolitical problems in the country,'' Vlok added.   Tutu's group helped arrange Sunday rallies at five sites acrossthe country to mark National Detainees Day. However, policeSaturday banned the Cape Town ceremony, where Tutu and Boesak wereto appear.   Police spokesman L.J. Haasbroek said he had no information onthe status of the four remaining rallies.   Clergymen indicated earlier this week they may defy any attemptby authorities to stop them.   Saturday's clampdown is the latest in a series of toughgovernment actions aimed at political opponents in recent weeks. Inaddition to banning political activity by 18 groups, the governmenthas imposed restrictions on individual activists and introducedlegislation to prohibit foreign funding of political activity.   In a related development, the Black Sash, an anti-apartheidgroup made up of white women, estimated Saturday that 1,500activists remain in detention without charge.   Black Sash, which has not been directly affected by the recentcrackdowns, said it would continue ``to defend those who arevoiceless and incarcerated.''   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge forvarying lengths of time during the 21-month-old state of emergency.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
