Ultrasound is widely used for medical imaging because itis safe, non-invasive and inexpensive. By measuring soundwaves bouncing off internal tissue, the devices generatemovie-like pictures, such as a fetus floating in a womb. Butultrasound can't detect organ damage or tumors becausepictures are too fuzzy.   Until now, doctors have been frustrated by the lack of&quot;contrast agents&quot; for ultrasound, dyes that are injected intothe bloodstream and &quot;light up&quot; tissue. Radiologists often usethem to sharpen images generated by computed tomography,magnetic resonance imaging and X-rays.   Molecular Biosystems of San Diego believes it has solvedthe problem with Albunex, microspheres of air wrapped inalbumin, a protein that naturally moves through blood.Albunex is based on a finding about 20 years ago that airbubbles that slipped into the bloodstream kicked back astrong sound-wave signal. Since then, scientists havestruggled to package bubbles tiny enough to reach distantorgans, yet sturdy enough to survive the trip through thebloodstream and especially the pounding heart.   In recent tests, Albunex helped produce ultrasoundpictures of blood blocked by clogged arteries and identifiedheart muscle damaged from a heart attack. The company isseeking U.S. approval for widescale use.   Meanwhile, Michael Violente at the University of Rochesterhas produced bubbicles, air-filled balls of an iodine-likesubstance smaller than red blood cells. In animal tests,injected bubbicles produced images of blood moving throughthe liver, suggesting that ultrasound may be able to detectchanges in blood flow typical of tiny tumors.                                                                                                          Vitamin C May Lessen   Hazards of X-Rays                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE may protect against potential damge fromanti-cancer radiation therapy, a researcher says.   Some scientists have argued for years that vitamin C canneutralize radicals, toxic chemicals released by cells inreaction to a variety of stimuli such as restricted bloodflow or radiation exposure. Because there's little evidenceto support this notion, a researcher at University ofMedicine and Dentistry in New Jersey recently tested the ideausing orange juice, low-dose radiation from medical X-raysand mice.   Dandamundi Rao, director of radiation research, measureddamage to the rodents' sperm caused by exposure to radiationlevels of less than one rad, about the amount produced by achest X-ray. In several experiments, Dr. Rao found that spermcells in mice given orange juice or vitamin C injectionssuffered half as much damage when exposed to the radiation assperm cells in mice that didn't get vitamin C in any form.   Dr. Rao says he believes drinking orange juice prior togetting X-rayed would be beneficial, but he acknowledges thatmuch research needs to be done to determine whether what hefound in mice is true for people.                                                                                                          Anti-Cancer Liposomes   May Make a Comeback                                                                                                          SCIENTISTS hope stealth technology will salvage adiscovery and boost some cancer therapies' effectiveness.   About a decade ago, several teams of scientists hailedliposomes as a way to decrease toxicity and increase potencyof existing medicines, especially anticancer drugs. Liposomesare microscopic pouch-like cells that the scientists formedfrom a solution of water and fats, such as egg yolks. Thescientists believed drugs trapped in fatty shells couldharmlessly slip through the gut, bombarding targets, such astumors, after the fat degraded.   Several publicly traded companies were formed in the early1980s to exploit the discovery. But hope faded when testsshowed the liposomes were destroyed by the body's immunesystem. A few years ago, researchers at Liposome Technologyof Menlo Park, Calif., decided to take a cue from stealthbombers that evade radar detection. The scientists cloakedlipsosomes outer surfaces with polyethylene glycol, whichformed a fuzzy water-filled coat that disguises theencapsulated drug.   In rodent tests last year, Eric Mayhew of Roswell ParkMemorial Institute, Buffalo, N.Y., found stealth liposomescontaining a cancer drug stopped the growth of colon tumorsbetter than the drug or liposomes alone. In recent months,doctors at Haddasah Medical Center in Israel found in testswith a handful of patients that the stealth liposomes coulddeliver a heftier payload of doxorubicin to a tumor site thancould normally be administered.   &quot;The big test is whether getting higher doses to the tumorproduces a clinical benefit,&quot; says Jeffrey Casdin, anOppenheimer andamp; Co. analyst. Those findings may come in thenext few months.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          DERMATOLOGISTS at the University of Pittsburgh say a drugbeing tested to prevent organ-transplant ejections may alsobe useful against psoriasis, a rash-like skin ailment.Psoriasis is caused by an overactive immune system, and thedrug, FK-506, reduces organ rejection by dampening the body'simmune reaction. In nine patients with severe psoriasis, thedrug significantly reduced symptoms in several weeks, theresearchers said. . . . Mapping electrical impulses from thebrain can detect drug abusers, say researchers at theUniversity of Texas Health Center in San Antonio. Theresearchers say a device they developed to analyze thebrain's electrical impulses identified a specific electricalsignal from 57 of 60 drug abusers.</TEXT></DOC>
