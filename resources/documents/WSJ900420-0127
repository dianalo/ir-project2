Led by a politically savvy, well-connected chairman, theagency is favored to succeed, a move that would usher in anew age in how the financial markets are regulated.</LP><TEXT>   The takeover target is the politically vulnerableCommodity Futures Trading Commission, or at least itsfastest-growing operation, regulation of thefinancial-futures markets. And the voters in this contestaren't shareholders, but members of Congress.   &quot;I really think the pressure is for doing something,&quot; saysSlade Gorton (R., Wash.), a member of the Senate AgricultureCommittee, which oversees the CFTC.   Like many corporations preyed upon by raiders, thewoebegone Commodity Futures Trading Com- mission is castingabout for the right defensive strategy to pursue. &quot;All ofthis is proceeding very rapidly,&quot; laments CFTC member FowlerWest.   Indeed, the CFTC suddenly finds itself with far lesssupport on Capitol Hill than it has had in the past. Whilethe CFTC tries to stand tough, its erstwhile backers inCongress -- and their campaign contributors in the Chicagofutures markets -- are privately discussing compromisesolutions that could result in switching much of the CFTC'sjurisdiction to the SEC. That's a drastic turnabout from justtwo years ago, when a proposal to transfer financial-futuresregulation to the SEC was fiercely opposed by the Chicagomarkets.   Now the positions are reversed: With the Chicago exchangesweakened by scandal, the CFTC looks ripe for a takeover. Andthe SEC holds a far stronger hand than it did in the past.   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden argues that jurisdiction overthe two markets needs to be unified in order to crack down onfraud and to have the U.S. speak with a stronger regulatoryvoice internationally. Most importantly, he has the backingof Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and his right-hand man,Robert Glauber. &quot;We don't need more regulation,&quot;Undersecretary Glauber told senators recently. &quot;But we doneed to move toward more unified regulation.&quot;   The Bush administration's backing was the signal for whichmany in Congress were waiting. &quot;I don't think we canunderestimate the power of Brady in forging ahead with amerger,&quot; says Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of theHouse finance subcommittee, and a longtime critic of thesplit between regulation of the stock markets by the SEC andthe regulation of stock futures by the CFTC.   Much more than in the past, Congress seems ready to move.After years of steadfastly blocking change, members of thetwo agriculture committees, which oversee the futuresmarkets, suddenly are trying to meet the SEC halfway. That'spartly because they are worried about being blamed foranother crash in the markets, and partly because they arebeginning to believe that a change in jurisdiction isinevitable, and they want to cut the best deal possible.   Sen. Gorton is proposing to shift oversight of financialfutures to the SEC from CFTC, leaving the futures regulatorto oversee the trading of traditional commodities, such aswheat, soybeans, and pork bellies. On the House side, Reps.Dan Glickman (D., Kan.) and Dennis Eckart (D., Ohio) havegone a step further, offering to merge the two agencies intoan overarching superagency. Securities committees in bothhouses have started holding hearings on the issue.   Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy andCommerce Committee, who has been silent on the issue, thisweek asked Treasury Secretary Brady to submit proposals byMay 4. While the Michigan Democrat didn't offer an opinion inhis letter, he has in the past likened stock-index futures to&quot;cockroaches.&quot; A Treasury official said the administrationwill respond with a proposal &quot;built around the option ofmoving index futures over to the SEC. This is a problem thatwon't go away until it gets resolved.&quot;   Still, hostile takeovers are never done deals untilcompleted, and this isn't any exception. Congress can beexceedingly slow to move, and the futures markets have yet tofire all their shots. &quot;The futures industry folks are a lotmore organized than the securities side,&quot; says Bradley Belt,a Republican aide to the Senate Banking Committee.   Adds SEC member Mary Schapiro: &quot;It may not go anywherethis year. If nothing happens this year, I don't know whatkind of momentum there will be next year. If you're changingthe status quo you need a lot of momentum.&quot;   But backers of the SEC's bid claim that momentum is withthem. They point to last October's stock-market plunge, whichshowed investors and regulators that the historic October1987 crash wasn't an isolated incident. Even usually stoicAlan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, told senators lastmonth that he was &quot;shaken&quot; by the second drop. Moreover, lastyear the two largest exchanges regulated by the CFTC wererocked by 48 indictments stemming from an undercover federalinvestigation of widespread trading fraud. That led CFTCcritics to wonder just what the watchdog was watching.   Additional pressure is coming from Wall Street, where thesecurities industry is in the throes of a depression.Investment in stocks has dwindled in recent years, andvolatility allegedly caused by the futures markets isincreasingly being blamed.   The dispute sounds technical, but a lot rides on it. Itcenters on commodity products called stock-index futures.Used mostly by institutional investors to control risk, indexfutures allow investors to bet on the direction of a group ofstocks without buying or selling the actual shares. Indexfutures correlate directly to stocks traded in New York, butare traded on the Chicago futures exchanges.   What makes them controversial is that they are used inprogram trading-strategies that use computers to trade ablizzard of stocks and futures. Program trading has beenblamed for accelerating both stock-market crashes. Becausethe cost of buying a basket of stocks through futures ischeaper than through stocks, critics of futures contend thatthe products create unusual gyrations in the stock market.   That argument infuriates CFTC Chairwoman Wendy Gramm, whocontends that economic studies never have proved a linkbetween futures and volatility. Moreover, she believes thatremoving index futures from the CFTC's purview would deeplyweaken an agency that would still be charged with overseeingagricultural products. (Her views are echoed by her husband,GOP Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, who sits on the Senate BankingCommittee, which oversees the SEC.)   &quot;No problems have been identified that would be fixed byshifting jurisdiction,&quot; Mrs. Gramm argues.   Still, compromise talks are under way, though not betweenthe two agencies, where the relationship is cooling. Thediscussions on Capitol Hill focus on raising the cost ofbuying the futures contracts, bringing those costs closer towhere they are in the stock market. Other, more technicalchanges also are being offered to the SEC's backers.   But many on Capitol Hill don't see the issue dissolvingeven if a compromise is reached. &quot;When the opportunitypresents itself, there are individuals who want to takeadvantage of it from a political standpoint,&quot; says Rep. GlennEnglish, head of the House subcommittee that oversees theCFTC. &quot;The reasons may change from time to time but it's thesame old tune.   &quot;This,&quot; the Oklahoma Democrat concludes, &quot;is simply aquestion of turf, simply power.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
