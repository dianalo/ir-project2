 These modules make Office Works particularly appealing tobuyers who want to help their group members communicate and coordinate theiractivities better.andM;PC Week tested Office Works 1.1 on a Novell NetWare SFT 2.15 LAN running overEthernet.andP;  Although it does not advance the state of the art for groupware,Office Works is a solid, reliable package that is very easy to learn and use.andM;PC Weeks also tested a beta copy of Office Works version 2.0, which wasscheduled for release March 15.andP;  (See story, Page 81.)andM;Both versions use the same well-documented installation program to move theOffice Works files onto a server.andP;  The person installing the software thenmust create an Office Works ID for each user.andP;  Unlike some stand-alone E-mailprograms, such as Da Vinci Systems Corp.'s eMail, Office Works can't createits own user IDs from existing network user I-Ds, a feature that would speedsetup on large LANs.andM;As with most LAN applications, there's more to administering Office Worksthan just setting it up.andP;  Key functions include maintaining user and groupIDs, handling the E-mail message database, and producing reports on messagetraffic.andM;Administering these features requires a variety of privileges; there aresystem, name and address, telephone and message privileges.andP;  Managers candelegate administrative functions by splitting those privileges among severalpeople.andM;The administrator is also responsible for maintaining Office Works' outsidelinks.andP;  Office Works can send faxes through a gateway PAC over any of thethree models of Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc.'s JT Fax boards, and it canuse a modem to send Telex messages via Western Union Corp.'s EasyLinkservice.andP;  PC Week used Office Works' fax gateway feature to successfully sendfaxes via a gateway PC that contained a Hayes' JT Fax 9600B board.andM;Despite these connections to the rest of the world, version 1.1 does not letusers on two different Office Works installations exchange messages.andP;  Eventwo copies of the product on different servers on the same LAN cannotcommunicate.andM;All Office Works users on a LAN who want to communicate with one another mustrun the program from the same server.andP;  (Version 2.0 removes thisrestriction.)andM;For users working from the same server, however, Office Works is easy tolearn and use.andP;  Good on-line tutorial and on-line help facilities aid usersin quickly getting Office Works up and running.andP;  The documentation isgenerally good, although more examples would be more helpful.andM;Logging in is fairly standard; the user just supplies a user ID and password.andO;The Office Works main screen uses textual point-and-shoot menus that are easyto navigate.andP;  Mouse support would be an improvement, as users must nowtraverse the menus with the keyboard arrow keys (version 2.0 will not remedythis situation.)andM;The main menu, which runs along the top of the screen, offers nine choices.andO;Five give access to the product's main modules.andP;  The others let users performadministrative functions, run the tutorial, set configuration parameters andexit.andM;The most important module, E-mail, offers features much like those of mostE-mail systems: Users can compose, read send, file, print and forwardmessages, and reply to messages.andP;  The product gives users all the basicfeatures they need to exchange messages easily.andM;Every mail message contains three parts: the Office Works user ID or IDs ofone or more recipients, a subject and the actual text of the message.andP;  Userscan either enter recipient user IDs directly or choose them from a list.andO;Office Works provides a very basic editor for entering and editing messagetext.andM;Users can add single or multiple DOS files as an attachment to a message.andO;Users can even specify a program that Office Works should run on eachattachment.andP;  With this feature, a user can, for example, send a filecontaining a picture and instruct Office Works to run ZSoft Corp.'s PCPaintbrush on that file.andP;  When the recipient asks to look at the message,Office Works starts PC Paintbrush automatically on the picture file.andM;Other common E-mail features include return receipts, which indicate to thesender that the message has been read; the ability to read in message textfrom ASCII files; and the ability to send messages to a group of users.andM;Despite its many mail features, Office Works does lack some of thecapabilities of a stand-alone E-mail package.andP;  Unlike Da Vinci's or cc:MailInc.'s E-mail programs, for example, Office Works does not support aliases ormailing lists.andP;  Users can send mail to the administrator-defined groups, butthose groups exist primarily to control access within Office Works to suchthings as document records.andP;  For most users, however, these E-mail omissionswill be only minor annoyances.andM;Office Works doesn't actually send its E-mail messages anywhere.andP;  Instead, itstores then in a central database on the server.andP;  Office Works manages thisdatabase with a specially modified run-time version of DataFlex, Data Access'database.andP;  Each new message goes into the database, and every recipient of amessage reads the same entry in the database.andP;  The entry stays in thedatabase until all of the recipients delete the message.andM;Office Works does not encrypt this message database.andP;  For reasons of securityit instead relies on the fact that the lines of text in messages do notappear sequentially in the database.andP;  To read another user's messages, aperson would have to know enough about DataFlex's storage structures and thedefinition of the E-mail message database to assemble lines of a message intoa coherent whole.andM;The other Office Works module is its calendar system.andP;  Compared withstand-alone calendar systems, this module is reasonably complete but not anindustry leader.andP;  Each user has a private calendar that contains appointmentsand reminders.andP;  The user enters the start and end times for all events, andas many as 12 lines of explanatory text per event.andM;Office Works then puts each event in the appropriate date and time on thecalendar.andP;  Users can see their appointments for a day, week or month, eitherin text form or as a bar chart.andM;Schedules Group MeetingsandM;The greatest strength of Office Works' calendar module is its ability to helpusers schedule group meetings.andP;  The first step is to create a calendar evenand identify all the participants.andP;  Next, the meeting planner either choosesa specific meeting time or gives a general time range and lets Office Workspick the time when the greatest number of participants are free.andM;A graph then shows the planner which users have conflicts with differentpotential meeting times.andP;  The planner next can choose a final time and date;Office Works will add the appropriate entry to each participant's calendar.andO;An RSVP feature can automatically send an E-mail message about the meeting tothe participants and collect their responses.andM;Office Works' E-mail facility is also tied to another main module, telephonemessages.andP;  The on-line telephone message pads are basically E-mail messagetemplates that offer such familiar telephone memo fields as &quot;Returned yourcall&quot; and &quot;Please call.&quot;andM;Office Works helps users keep track of their contacts beyond the LAN with itsnames-and-addresses module.andP;  This module is basically a shared phone bookthat resides in a DataFlex database.andP;  Each phone-book entry can containinformation on both the contact and the company.andP;  The phone-book databasestores a single record for each person or company, but many users can sharethose records.andM;The least useful of all the major modules is document control.andP;  Office Worksdoes not actually store documents.andP;  Instead, it keeps only information aboutdocuments--such as author, subject and the DOS file name of the actualldocument--in a central DataFlex database.andM;While Office Works uses DataFlex databases in all of its modules, users canwork with almost all of those databases only from within Office Works.andP;  Thelone exception is the names-and-addresses database, which users can importand export via Office Works options.andM;Office Works provides all of these services at a price similar to that ofmany LAN E-mail packages and less than that of most groupware products.andP;  Asix-user license costs $495; an unlimited-user license costs $1,395.andM;Data Access Corp. is based in Miami and can be contacted at (800) 451-3539 or(305) 238-0012.andM;Getting a HandleandM;On What Is andandM;Isn't GroupwareandM;The label &quot;groupware&quot; appears with such frequency these days that it'shelpful to determine how to tell what's groupware and what's not.andM;Perhaps the best definition of groupware is software that helps a group ofpeople work together.andP;  That definition, however, is not very useful whendeciding which products are groupware and which are not.andP;  A better way is toexamine the major characteristics that most groupware packages share.andM;Because groupware programs aim to help people work together, those packagesmust let those people communicate.andP;  The first feature that groupwarerequires, therefore, is a physical connection between the machines of thepeople in the group.andP;  For microcomputer-based groupware, this connectiontypically is a LAN.andM;A LAN, however, is not groupware in and of itself.andP;  A groupware product mustuse the LAN's basic communications features to help members of the groupshare and manage information.andP;  The most obvious groupware tool for this jobis E-mail.andM;Like many other groupware packages, Data Access Corp.'s Office Works hasE-mail as its central feature.andP;  Its phone-message system, for example, isjust a front end to its E-mail, and its group-scheduling component usesE-mail to tell people when a meeting is to occur.andM;Document SharingandM;E-mail is not, of course, the only way to share information.andP;  Another tool isgroup filing.andP;  For some groupware packages, the filing system is little morethan a simplified interface to the LAN server's file system.andP;  Others, such asForComment, from Broderbund Software, let group members share and comment ona single document.andM;Most groupware also helps groups share and manage activities.andP;  To-do lists,calendars and schedules are common.andM;These tools are also available as standalone products, but groupwaretypically takes them a step further.andP;  A manager might, for example, want tocall a meeting of the group.andP;  A groupware product can show the managerpotential schedule conflicts, place the final meeting time on the schedulesof everyone in the group, and send E-mail messages to tell everyone about themeeting and to remind them as the time draws closer.andM;In trying to define groupware, it's also useful to note that similarproducts, such as Digital Equipment Corp.'s all-In-1 and Data General Corp.'sCEO, have been available on minicomputers for years.andP;  The biggest differencesbetween the PC-based groupware products and those on larger systems is thatthe PC products run on LANs rather than on a central host.andP;  Indeed, thegreatest advantage of LAN-based groupware may well be that it gives mini andmainframe users a way to move to PCs without surrendering some of thefeatures that initially attracted them to time-sharing systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
