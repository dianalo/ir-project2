On another line is Robert Strauss, the former Democratic chairman. On the third is Michael Dukakis.    At the center of all this, in an office littered with last week's newspapers and the odd political memorandum, is Susan Estrich, the Massachusetts governor's 35-year-old campaign manager. Now, with Mr. Dukakis only a week away from winning his party's nomination, Ms. Estrich is also at the center of the political world. She is a Harvard Law School professor who has been tested in the arena of partisan politics, a pathfinder for women in one of the last male preserves, a manager who inspires deep loyalty among her allies and bitter resentment among her foes. This product of the breezy suburbs of Boston's North Shore, says Common Cause president Fred Wertheimer, combines &quot;the intellectual skills of a Supreme Court justice and the political skills of a Chicago ward heeler.&quot;    Ms. Estrich took over the Dukakis campaign at the moment of its greatest peril. She replaced John Sasso, who resigned in the furor over a campaign video that prompted plagiarism charges against Sen. Joseph Biden and eventually drove the Delaware Democrat from the presidential race.    She still hasn't acquired the easy personal relationship that Mr. Sasso had with the governor. But she was one of the four confidants with the candidate when he made the critical decision to choose Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen to be his vice presidential running mate.    Like her candidate, Ms. Estrich is deliberate, cautious, cerebral and, above all, disciplined. Mr. Dukakis's campaign in the winter and spring months mirrored both the candidate and the manager: no sizzle, no soaring emotions, no risks. There wasn't any one clever maneuver, any one brilliant stroke, any one dash of campaign virtuosity -- simply the relentless determination to lay out a national organization, raise more money than anyone else and avoid carelessness.    Ms. Estrich was drawn into politics in her teens, doing volunteer work in a special election that sent Democrat Michael Harrington to Congress in 1969. That contest, portrayed at the time as a referendum on President Nixon's conduct of the Vietnam War, was a formative experience for her. &quot;You could walk around, give out leaflets, talk to people and win,&quot; she says now. &quot;It seemed so great. But it was years until one of my candidates won again.&quot;    But in those years she grafted practical political experience onto an impressive academic resume. In Sen. Edward Kennedy's 1980 challenge to President Carter, Ms. Estrich served as deputy issues director, debated Newark Mayor Kenneth Gibson on television, organized Rabbis for Kennedy and sometimes drove the press bus. With Ronald Brown, now Jesse Jackson's closest adviser, she traveled around the country talking to convention delegations and then, in the general election, organized transportation, telephone banks and volunteers for Mr. Carter.    Four years later, she was executive director of the Democratic platform committee, managing tough foreign-policy negotiations in an atmosphere of enormous tension between Jewish groups and followers of Mr. Jackson. &quot;She took the burning issue of the spring and made sure it didn't become an explosive issue at the convention,&quot; says former Rep. John Cavanaugh of Nebraska, who was Sen. Gary Hart's delegate to the platform committee.    &quot;Susan,&quot; says Kate Stith, a Yale Law School professor and longtime friend, &quot;plays by the boys' rules.&quot;    And yet the Susan Estrich who seems so formidable also sometimes seems so vulnerable. When she was younger she sought to blunt the stigma of being a smart girl -- &quot;She was always serious, never goofy, acting like a grown-up even when she was a kid,&quot; says Carol Lunder Rubinstein, a classmate from Glover School in Marblehead, Mass. -- by becoming a baton twirler. When she was rejected by Radcliffe College, she worried about &quot;not being good enough.&quot;    She was good enough, of course. Merrick Garland, whom she beat out to become president of the law review, says it was obvious in the early months of law school that she was the hardest-driving and best-organized student in her class, often willing to work until four in the morning. If Mr. Dukakis wins the election, Ms. Estrich -- who is married to former Mondale speech writer Martin Kaplan, now vice president, motion-picture production, for Walt Disney Pictures Inc. -- would be in line for a high position. Eventually, some suggest, she could even be the first Democratic woman appointed to the Supreme Court.    Even so, she has never seemed to lose a touch of insecurity. Even as the winning Democratic campaign manager, recipient of scores of accolades this spring, she often sought to diminish the role played by Mr. Sasso in laying the groundwork for the Dukakis drive. In a Los Angeles Times profile of her that caused a furor in political circles, she spoke disparagingly of &quot;the twits of the press,&quot; and was quoted as using the word &quot;I&quot; seven times in one paragraph, including the statement, &quot;I am in charge.&quot;    Her critics complain that she sees sexism where it doesn't exist, and dislikes being challenged. And it remains to be seen whether she can handle the downturns that inevitably will occur between now and the general election in November; for instance, the Dukakis campaign bungled getting advance word to Jesse Jackson that he wouldn't be on the ticket.    In general, however, such miscues have been rare on Ms. Estrich's watch, and she says she is prepared for whatever comes her way. &quot;Being first at doing things gives you a lot of publicity,&quot; she says, &quot;but you're also watched a little more carefully.&quot;    That means a little more pressure, too. &quot;The last thing I want to do is to make it more difficult for the next woman,&quot; she says, adding that she expects several women will be running presidential campaigns before the century is out. &quot;Some women will do very well and some won't, but that doesn't say anything about whether women can do it.&quot;    Ms. Estrich, who wrote a book on rape law based in part on her own rape, was independent from factional law-school politics and scholarship. In the law as in politics, her perspective is practical, not ideological, and this committed Democrat traces part of her interest in government to a summer she spent in the White House Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention during the Nixon administration.    &quot;She's flexible, not an ideologue,&quot; says Ms. Stith. &quot;She's more interested in figuring out what she can achieve than trying to visualize an ideal world.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
