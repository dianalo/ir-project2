The nuclear states are allowed to decay with proton orneutron ejection. The discussion is focused on the analysis of the radialbehavior of transition densities in terms of their microscopic structure.The role of RPA ground state correlations is clarified. The surface propertiesof resonant nuclear states extracted from photonuclear and (e,e'x) reactionsat low momentum transfer are confronted with the full radial dependenceof the resonant structure shown in charge transition densities.</TEXT></DOC>
