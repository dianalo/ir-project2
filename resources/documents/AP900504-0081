Both countries claim the mountainous region, which is splitbetween them along a contested frontier where Indian and Pakistanitroops face each other. The dispute flared into war in 1948 and1965.   On Thursday, a powerful right-wing Indian political party urgedIndia's army to attack the alleged bases in Pakistan to ``clean outthe terrorists.''
