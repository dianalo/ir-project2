(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Members of the raunchy rap group 2Live Crew became ``martyrs for the First Amendment'' when they werearrested on obscenity charges after a concert, their lawyer says.   Band leader Luther ``Luke Skyywalker'' Campbell and Chris``Fresh Kid Ice'' Wongwon were arrested by more than a dozensheriff's detectives early Sunday.   They were charged with singing lyrics from theirplatinum-selling album, which was ruled obscene by a federal judgein Fort Lauderdale.   ``If we had to do it again, we'd do it again,'' Wongwon saidbefore the Miami rappers took the stage in Phoenix on Sunday night.   ``We were arrested for playing to adults,'' he said. He addedthat Broward County (Fla.) Sheriff Nick Navarro has a racial biasagainst their music.   ``It's a black company, it's a black group,'' he said.   Campbell, 29, and Wongwon, 26, were freed without bail after twohours in jail. The misdemeanor carries up to a year in jail and a$1,000 fine.   The other band members, Mark ``Brother Marquis'' Ross and David``Mr. Mixx'' Hobbs, left Hollywood's Club Futura in a separate carand were not stopped. Navarro said arrest warrants would be issuedfor them today.   ``They could have rapped anything up to and including `WhiteChristmas,''' said sheriff's spokesman Al Gordon. ``As long as theydidn't sing anything from `As Nasty As They Wanna Be,' ... theywould not have been arrested.''   The rappers' attorney, Bruce Rogow, said the judge's ruling,Friday's arrest of a Fort Lauderdale record store owner who soldthe album to undercover agents, and the arrests of band membersshow Navarro and other anti-obscenity crusaders are ``out ofcontrol.''   ``Now everybody's rallying around the First Amendment and,incidentally, around 2 Live Crew,'' Rogow said. ``It's made themmartyrs for the First Amendment.''   The arrests gave 2 Live Crew publicity it would not otherwisehave received, he said.   ``There was a lot of sex _ real sex, nude dancing, prostitution_ going on in Broward County last night,'' Rogow said. ``Thecriminals must have a had a field day. This is nothing more thantalking dirty.''   In Phoenix Sunday night, the band sang two ``clean'' songs at aconcert with seven other bands. Concert organizers said the rapperswere asked not to perform the X-rated versions.   The band refused to go along with a similar request at theiradults-only concert Sunday in Hollywood, where they screamedprofanities along with a wildly gyrating audience of about 400.   Undercover detectives documented the band's performance, whichincluded repeated insults against Navarro.   ``We didn't want to create any commotion in there, so I toldthem to let them get out of there and arrest them away from thepremises,'' said Navarro.   Deputies pulled over Campbell and Wongwon's car several blocksfrom the club.   Rogow said he believes U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez'sruling Wednesday did not make it illegal to sing the songs in asetting like Club Futura.</TEXT></DOC>
