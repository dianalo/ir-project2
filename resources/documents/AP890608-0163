KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   El Salvador's air force improperly sold$100,000 worth of fuel provided by the United States to air crewsresupplying the Nicaraguan Contras in an effort set up by OliverNorth, the General Accounting Office told Congress Thursday.   Assistant Comptroller General Frank C. Conahan testified that thetransfer of the fuel ``violated agreements between the United Statesand El Salvador stipulating that title or possession ofU.S.-supplied defense items or services cannot be transferredwithout prior U.S. government consent.''   Conahan said pilots under contract to the Contra resupplyoperation run by former Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord boughtfuel on at least 63 occasions in 1986 from tanks on the militaryside of Ilopango Air Base. He said U.S.-supplied fuel was providedon 32 of those occasions.   Conahan testified on behalf of the GAO, an investigatory arm ofCongress, before the Senate Appropriations Foreign Operationssubcommittee.   Felix Rodriquez, a private individual supporting the Contraeffort, had, at the request of National Security Council officialOliver North, set up an operations center at the Ilopango base touse air drops inside Nicaragua to resuply the Contras.   Conahan said that from April to September 1986 the Salvadoran airforce old 61,107 gallons of the U.S.-provided fuel to the Contraresupply enterprise.   ``We found no evidence that the Salvadoran government requestedor obtained U.S. consent for the Salvadoran air force to transfermilitary aid program funded fuel to the Contra supply operation,''Conahan said.   Nor, he said, was evidence found that any U.S. personnel knew ofthe sales.   But he said a ``substantial violation'' of the 1986 salesagreement with El Salvador may have occurred because the transferstook place at a time when the United States was barred by law fromusing aid funds to support military or paramilitary operations ofthe Contras.   Conahan said it was also learned that the Salvadoran air forcesold nearly a million gallons of aviation fuel worth some $580,000to U.S. military and contract aircraft delivering non-lethal aid tothe Contras.   He said the GAO accepted as ``reasonable'' the explanation thatthose transfers were not improper because the U.S. governmentprovided the fuel in the first place and because it was transferredto U.S. entities.   But Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the ForeignOperations subcommittee, said it would seem ``unique'' that theUnited States put itself in the position of first giving away thefuel, then paying for it.   ``You could well say we were paying for it twice,'' he said.   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who initiated the investigation, saidthe GAO had ``uncovered the first documented case of a transfer ofU.S. foreign aid dollars to the Contra resupply network.''   Additionally, he said, when sales to other ``third-party''aircraft are taken into account, ``the Salvadoran air force received$800,000 in cash for fuel it received free under the U.S. foreignaid program.''   Michael Kozak, acting assistant secretary for state forInter-American Affairs, acknowleged that the sales and transfers didtake place.   But he said the department does not believe the violation to be``substantial,'' given the fact that the United States gave ElSalvador $230 million worth of aviation fuel in 1986 and 1987.   ``Furthermore, it does not appear that the transferred fuelsustained the Nicaraguan resistance resupply operations over anextended period of time, nor does it appear that this was supportthat the resistance could not have purchased from any commercialfacility,'' he said.   Kozak said a ``lack of understanding'' on the part of groundpersonnel at Ilopango as to which fuel required U.S. permissionbefore it could be transferred ``seems to have been the main, if notthe most important, factor in this unauthorized diversion.''   H. Diehl McKalip, operations director of the Defense SecurityAssistance Agency, said that because of a concern that assistancefunds might have been or might be ``converted into unrestrictedcash,'' regulations have been issued to assure that any future fundsgenerated from fuel transfers be deposited in a special holdingaccount.   Prior to the change, he said, $801,519 was paid directly to theSalvadoran air force. Since the change, $973,543 has been creditedto the holding account, McKalip said.</TEXT></DOC>
