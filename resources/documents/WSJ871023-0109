But U.S. officials are reacting cautiously to the report because the Norwegian police authorities who issued it offered no conclusive evidence that either U.S. companies, or several European machine-tool manufacturers they also implicated, actually violated the allied embargo on such shipments. The export-control rules are set by the Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom.    The Norwegian report identified six Italian, French, British and West German companies as apparent violators, but it didn't name any U.S. companies. The report simply said that information concerning the U.S. companies &quot;has been conveyed to American authorities.&quot;    Paul Freedenberg, acting undersecretary of commerce for export administration, said he still hasn't received such information. But his aides said the department will conduct a &quot;full and sweeping investigation&quot; if the information warrants it.    The Norwegian report aroused some suspicions in other European capitals that Oslo was &quot;finger-pointing&quot; to stave off the threat of U.S. legislative sanctions against the Norwegian arms maker, Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk AS. The Norwegian police claimed to have uncovered numerous other possible violations of Cocom rules while investigating Kongsberg's admitted infractions.    The report also provoked an outraged denial from a British machine-tool maker, KTM Ltd. Michael Bright, chairman of the Sussex, England, company, acknowledged that his company shipped two machine tools to China, as the report said. But he denied an assertion in the report that the shipments &quot;may also be in violation of Cocom regulations.&quot; Mr. Bright said those KMT machines fell within Cocom's standards for permissible shipments to the Soviet bloc.    Congressional and administration sources on Wednesday mistakenly said the KTM machines were shipped to the Soviet Union. Cocom restrictions apply to China as well as the Soviet bloc.    U.S. officials conceded that the Norwegian report is inconclusive. They said interpretations vary about whether many of the machine-tool shipments cited in the report would be permissible under Cocom rules. While the shipments might not be allowed under the U.S. reading of the rules, many European countries follow less stringent interpretations.    Moreover, Norwegian Ambassador Kjell Eliassen told reporters here that the police findings indicate only a possible &quot;contravention of Cocom rules&quot; on the part of the companies. &quot;We don't know whether those firms got the necessary licenses from their governments,&quot; he said. To be in effective breach of Cocom rules, a company would have to falsify export documents to ship banned items or completely bypass licensing authorities.    Still, the U.S. sought to turn the Norwegian disclosures to its advantage. &quot;There's now no alternative for the allies but to hold a high-level Cocom meeting to secure commitments for stronger enforcement,&quot; Mr. Freedenberg said. Mr. Freedenberg was in Paris with a number of other senior administration officials trying to get Cocom members to strengthen their licensing staffs and to stiffen jail terms and administrative penalties for violators.    One probable source for Norway's suspicions about U.S. infractions is Bernard Green, a former Kongsberg employee who, with two other former Kongsberg employees, faces charges relating to the firm's infractions. Mr. Green said Kongsberg technicians spotted a VAX 780, a large computer made by Digital Equipment Corp., at Volgodonsk, where the Soviet Union maintains a factory for making nuclear power-plant parts.    Digital, a Maynard, Mass., company that manufactures the powerful computer, denied having shipped such a machine to the Soviet bloc. It said it has sold lower-power models in conformity with Cocom rules during the detente period.    The National Machine Tool Builders Association, a U.S. industry group, said the Commerce Department enforces export-control rules so strictly that it would be nearly impossible for its members to ship a banned machine to a Soviet location. &quot;Besides, we only have 1% of the entire bloc market,&quot; said James Mack, the association's spokesman.    The other European companies mentioned in the Norwegian report either dismissed its allegations or couldn't be reached for comment. Manfred Hanning, a board member of Schiess AG in Duesseldorf, West Germany, said the report's claim that Schiess shipped 32 machines to the Soviet Union in probable violation of Cocom rules is &quot;with absolute certainty not true.&quot;    Mr. Hanning insisted that all Schiess shipments to the Soviet bloc have gone through the proper licensing authorities. He said it's a &quot;puzzle&quot; why anyone should link the company to illicit exports. Officials at two other West Germany companies cited in the report, O. Donerries G.m.b.H., and Donauwerke G.m.b.H., couldn't be contacted. </TEXT></DOC>
