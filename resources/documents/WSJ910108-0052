A federal appeals court in New York sanctioned such alegal action last July, upholding the right of a formershareholder of Viacom International Inc. to sue ConistonPartners and other partnerships for more than $11 millionallegedly gained from short-swing trading of Viacom stock in1986.</LP><TEXT>   Federal law prohibits a company's directors, officers andprincipal shareholders -- those holding more than 10% of thesecurities -- from taking advantage of inside corporateknowledge by making &quot;short-swing&quot; profits. Short-swingprofits are defined as those from buying and selling thecompany's securities within a six-month period. The law givesa shareholder the right to sue in behalf of the corporationto require that short-swing profits be returned to thecompany.   Yesterday, the high court said it will decide whether suchsuits may be filed by former shareholders who gave up theirstock as part of a corporate merger.   The 1934 Securities Exchange Act says such a lawsuit maybe filed by an &quot;owner&quot; of the company's shares. TheSecurities and Exchange Commission filed a brief in theappeals court arguing that the law should be interpreted toallow lawsuits by shareholders who gave up their interest ina company because of a takeover or merger. The SEC willconsider on Thursday a somewhat narrower proposed rule toallow such lawsuits by former shareholders if they went tocourt before giving up their stock in a merger.   If the Supreme Court interprets the law narrowly to saythat such lawsuits may only be filed by current shareholders,that would undermine the SEC's position.   The question of who may file such lawsuits is of interestto investment companies that were caught up in the mergerfever of the 1980s, and to shareholders whose interests wereaffected by corporate takeovers. But these interests arerelatively small, according to Harvey Pitt, a Washingtonsecurities lawyer. &quot;This is a narrower case than the courthas been taking recently in the securities field,&quot; says Mr.Pitt.   The lawsuit was filed by Ira Mendell, who owned stock inViacom International, and sued the Coniston Partners,Coniston's general partner, the firm of Gollust, Tierney andamp;Oliver, and others who were considered principal shareholderslegally because they owned more than a 10% interest inViacom.   After the lawsuit was filed, Viacom International wasbought by an Arsenal Holdings Inc. unit. Shareholders weregiven shares in Arsenal Holdings, which then changed its nameto Viacom Inc. and became the parent of Viacom International.   In response to the lawsuit, the defendants argued that theshareholders no longer held shares in Viacom Internationaland couldn't sue over short-swing profits in ViacomInternational.   In November 1988, a federal district court in New Yorkaccepted that argument and dismissed the lawsuit. But theappeals court reinstated the lawsuit, urging a &quot;pragmatic&quot;view of securities law. (Gollust vs. Mendell)                                                                                                          Football Antitrust Case                                                                                                          The justices let stand a ruling that National FootballLeague players can't challenge, on antitrust grounds, leaguerestrictions on free agents that have remained in effect evenafter the players' collective bargaining agreement expired in1987.   A federal appeals court in St. Louis ruled in November1989 that an exemption from antitrust laws for most laboragreements remained in effect even after the NFL contractexpired because the labor relationship continued between theplayers association and the team owners. The players filedthe lawsuit against the free agency rules in 1987 at theconclusion of a strike that ended with the players returningto work without a contract. (Powell vs. National FootballLeague)                                                                                                          Lawyer Free Speech                                                                                                          The high court agreed to review the legality of staterestrictions on public comments by lawyers about pendingcriminal cases. The justices will hear the appeal of a LasVegas lawyer, Dominic Gentile, who was privately reprimandedby a Nevada attorney disciplinary board for holding a newsconference to discuss his client's indictment in 1988. Mr.Gentile alleged police misconduct in the charging of hisclient with larceny, racketeering and drug trafficking. Theclient was acquitted six months later.   Nevada rules of conduct for lawyers, like those of manystates, prohibit making public statements that mightprejudice the trial. The rules say that in criminal cases,public statements about the credibility of witnesses,suspects or defendants should be avoided.   The Nevada Supreme Court upheld the reprimand of Mr.Gentile. In his high court appeal, Mr. Gentile argues thatthe restrictions on public statements by lawyers violate theFirst Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. Lawyers forMr. Gentile argue that there must be evidence that a lawyer'scomments present a real threat to a defendant's fair trialbefore they can be prohibited, and that such rules can't betoo broad or vague. (Gentile vs. State Bar of Nevada)                                                                                                          Federal Agency Rules                                                                                                          The justices agreed to review the authority of federalagencies to adopt, without public notice or hearings,practical rules to implement programs authorized by Congress.   Last April, a federal appeals court here struck down rulesissued without public notice by the Federal AviationAdministration to carry out a law that allowed the agency toimpose civil penalties of as much as $50,000 on airlines forsafety violations. The appeals court said the rules weresubstantive in nature, requiring public notice and comment,rather than procedural, which an agency may issue withoutpublic input. The FAA rules were challenged by the majorairlines' trade group, the Air Transport Association ofAmerica.   Although the FAA has now issued new rules after receivingpublic comments, the Justice Department said the appealscourt decision could interfere with rule-making by otheragencies. (Department of Transportation vs. Air TransportAssociation)                                                                                                          Sunbelt Savings Appeal                                                                                                          The high court refused to hear a challenge to the actionof federal regulators in 1988 declaring Sunbelt SavingsAssociation of Texas insolvent and reorganizing it. Thechallenge was filed by individuals and a land-developmentcompany that had filed suits against Sunbelt Savings beforethe government action. Sunbelt assets were transferred to anew thrift, Sunbelt Savings FSB. (Gulley vs. Sunbelt Savings)                                                                                                          Redrawing Boundaries                                                                                                          The U.S. Supreme Court denied a Los Angeles County Boardof Supervisors petition to review lower court rulings thatthe county discriminated against Hispanics when redrawingdistrict boundaries after the 1980 census.   The high court's action clears the way for a specialelection on Jan. 22, using new district lines designed tohelp elect a Hispanic to the county's five-member governingboard.   &quot;This is a day of great historic importance andcelebration for Latinos and all residents of Los AngelesCounty,&quot; said an American Civil Liberties Union attorney.   ---   Kevin G.
