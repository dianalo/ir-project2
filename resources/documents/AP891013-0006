Police here could not confirm the abduction.   In Bern, Switzerland on Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesmanClemens Birrer said the woman, whom he refused to identify, waskidnapped by gunmen in northern Lebanon on Sunday.   A reliable Lebanon security source, speaking on condition ofanonymity, identified the woman as Astrid Fischer, 31, and said shewas was released in Tripoli this afternoon.   The source said gunmen kidnapped Ms. Fischer from a house in thevillage of Koubbaa, 31 miles north of Beirut, on Sunday. Birrer hadsaid the kidnapping occurred in Tripoli, which is 50 miles north ofBeirut.   The source refused to identify the kidnappers but said thewoman, a flight attendant with Swissair, was ``interrogated inconnection with her activities and stay in Lebanon.''   He refused to elaborate.   The abduction would be the third of a Swiss national in Lebanonin a week. The two previous kidnappings were linked to the case ofa Shiite Moslem militant serving a life sentence in Switzerland forhijacking a jet.   When asked about the latest reported kidnapping, Tripoli policechief Col. Nabil Zein said today: ``I have no information at allabout this kidnapping. We have neither a notification nor acomplaint about such a kidnapping.''   ``I read the report from Bern in the papers this morning,'' hetold The Associated Press when contacted by telephone.   Birrer said the woman's parents asked authorities not topublicize the case. He told reporters of the kidnapping after beingasked about unattributed news reports of it.   ``There is no sign of a political background to thiskidnapping,'' he added.   Switzerland asked Syria, which controls much of northernLebanon, to help find the woman, he said.   In all, 19 Westerners are missing in Lebanon, including eightAmericans. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Shiite Moslems loyal to Iran are thought to be holding most ofthe hostages.   On Oct. 6, two Swiss Red Cross workers, Elio Erriquez andEmmanual Christen, were abducted in southern Lebanon. No groupclaimed responsibility for the kidnappings, and no demands havebeen made.   Later that day, a PLO spokesman blamed radical Palestinianguerrillas led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal for thoseabductions and linked them to a Shiite Moslem militant, MohammedHariri. He is serving a life sentence in Switzerland for hijackingan Air Afrique jetliner in 1987 and killing a French passenger.   Lebanese police also blamed Abu Nidal's group for the Oct. 6abductions. The Abu Nidal organization denied involvement.   Birrer said he did not believe there was any connection betweenthe kidnappings Oct. 6 and that reported Thursday.   All Swiss Red Cross personnel were withdrawn from Lebanonfollowing the kidnapping in November of Peter Winkler, a reliefworker in Sidon. Winkler was released a month later, and the Swisscontingent returned after receiving assurances from all sides inLebanon that humanitarian workers would not be targeted forkidnappings.</TEXT></DOC>
