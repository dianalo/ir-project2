As president-elect, George Bush has moved away from the kind ofappointments that gave the U.N. post to Daniel Patrick Moynihan,Andrew Young, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Bush himself _ all members ofthe president's Cabinet.   On Dec. 7, Bush named Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador toIsrael, to replace Vernon A. Walters, a former deputy director ofthe CIA.   Some former ambassadors made it clear they reported to thepresident himself, not the State Department. But Pickering, unlikehis predecessors, will not be in the Cabinet and will report to theassistant secretary of state for international organizations.   Bush's said his choice ``symbolizes the importance I place on theUnited Nations, as well as the Foreign Service.''   Pickering is the first career diplomat to get the posting sinceCharles Yost was appointed in 1969. They are the only two careerofficers to hold the position since it was established 43 years ago.   Ambassadors have included Henry Cabot Lodge, Adlai Stevenson,Arthur Goldberg, George Ball, John Scali and William Scranton.   Although U.S.-U.N. relations have been strained during theeight-year Reagan administration, Bush has said the global situation``makes the U.N. a more positive arena for constructive U.S. actionthan it has been in recent years, offering greater opportunity forvigorous U.S. leadership in dealing with critical global problems.''   The choice of Pickering reflects the new importance the UnitedStates accords the 159-member organization, which this year scoredsuccesses from Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf to southern Africa.   U.S. relations with the United Nations evolved from a love affairto estrangement in the 1960s and 70s when the Soviet Bloc anddeveloping nations united to denounce the ``imperialist West.''   Today, however, is an era of good feelings, respect for the worldbody and no more name-calling. Improved U.S.-Soviet ties make theUnited Nations an increasingly effective vehicle for tacklinginternational problems.   Pickering, 57, has served as ambassador in Jordan and hisexperience gives him extra credibility on the Middle East issue,which figures prominently on the U.N. agenda.   The Cabinet status for U.N. ambassador originated with Lodge, aformer presidential candidate who served from 1953 to 1960. Sincethen no U.N. envoy, except Yost, settled for less in prestige,salary and access to the president.   But few observers see Pickering's posting as a downgrading of theposition.   Ed Luck, president of the U.N. Association of the United States,a pro-U.N. group, said it signifies ``a return to normalcy'' and acommitment to use the United Nations to carry out foreign policyobjectives.   ``He won't just give speeches defending our honor andprinciples,'' he told The Associated Press.   In the past, he said, ``there frequently has been some tension''between the U.N. envoy and the administration, State Department orCongress.   Ms. Kirkpatrick was known for her combative speeches whichfrequently pointed out the hypocrisy of some totalitarian regimescriticizing the United States.   Mark Franz, policy analyst at the conservative HeritageFoundation, which frequently criticizes the world body, saidPickering's appointment shows ``that Mr. Bush will be in charge.U.N. policy will not be made by an individual, charismatic person ...</TEXT></DOC>
