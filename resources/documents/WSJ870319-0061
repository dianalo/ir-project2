At a first round of congressional hearings beginning today, the department plans to spell out strong concerns that the position of court-appointed independent counsel may violate the separation-of-powers doctrine. But while providing more detail than in the past about such flaws, administration officials say the department will stop short of flatly saying that the entire law is unconstitutional.    The law in question is the 1978 Ethics in Government Act, which allows the Justice Department to seek counsels to independently prosecute allegations of wrongdoing by high-level federal officials.    The administration apparently hopes to prod Congress to correct any constitutional conflicts in the law without being blamed for undercutting current investigations, such as those involving former White House aide Michael Deaver and the Iran-Contra arms-sale scandal. The law is scheduled to expire in January unless Congress extends it.    But Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.), chairman of a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee that will handle extension of the law, says the constitutional questions aren't the real issue. He says the Justice Department has been &quot;covertly . . . undermining&quot; the law &quot;by misapplying its provisions and stretching beyond Congress's will the department's decision-making authority.&quot;    Sen. Levin says the department has improperly combined two separate stages of investigation. The law requires the two stages as part of the process of deciding whether an independent counsel should be appointed.    In the first stage, the attorney general reviews whether he has received allegations that are specific and from a credible source. If so, the second step gives the attorney general as long as 90 days for a &quot;preliminary investigation,&quot; after which he must report to a special court, either requesting an independent counsel or explaining why one isn't needed. Sen. Levin contends that the department has combined these two steps, hoping to wrap up matters more quickly and avoid reporting to the court in some cases.    Another problem, Sen. Levin contends, is that the department uses the wrong legal standard in deciding whether to ask a court to appoint an independent counsel, making it less likely that the attorney general will request such an appointment. Sen. Levin says the law requires the Justice Department to determine only whether there are &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; to believe further investigation is warranted, but that the department has narrowed that to &quot;whether there is a reasonable prospect of conviction.&quot;    Interest in constitutional questions pertaining to the law has increased because of lawsuits filed separately by Mr. Deaver and by Lt. Col. Oliver North, a former national security aide involved in the Iran-Contra affair. Both lawsuits have been dismissed as premature by federal judges, and the Justice Department, which had requested independent counsels in both cases, has avoided taking any position on the law's constitutionality.    However, lawyers for Mr. Deaver, who was indicted on perjury charges yesterday, said they would raise the constitutional issues again by seeking dismissal of the charges.    The congressional hearings give the administration a chance to air its longstanding, sometimes vehement complaints about the constitutionality of the law. But officials said Attorney General Edwin Meese wants to avoid, at least for now, taking a definitive position. &quot;We will take a firm position on the constitutionality . . . when that's necessary in court, but not before,&quot; said one administration official. &quot;If Congress wants to work with us to have a more defensible law, we're ready to cooperate.&quot;    On the House side, Rep. Peter Rodino (D., N.J.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is a leader of a bipartisan coalition defending the constitutionality of the law and urging that it be expanded to cover additional White House and Justice Department officials.    &quot;It's not in anybody's interest to have these constitutional issues raised,&quot; in the midst of the Iran-Contra investigation and other probes, according to Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.), a Judiciary Committee member. </TEXT></DOC>
