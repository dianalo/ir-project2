The new products are aimed at strengthening Digital in the marketfor powerful workstations used by engineers, scientists anddesigners. Digital is the nation's second largest computer makerbehind International Business Machines Corp.   Reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, simplifies thecircuitry of a computer's central processor and offers cost savings.But it is a new thrust for Digital, which until this year built allits machines around its proprietary VAX architecture.   Among the Maynard-based company's new offerings is its DECstation2100, a workstation using a RISC microprocessor made by MIPSComputer Co. of Sunnyvale, Calif., and the Unix operating systemdeveloped by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.   Digital said the machine, with a price tag starting at $7,950, isthe industry's lowest-priced color, RISC-based, Unix workstation.   Digital also announced several new entries in its VAX line, ledby the VAX 6400, which it said is up to 85 percent more powerfulthan its previous high-end machine, the VAX 8840.   A new version of the VMS operating system software for VAXmachines was also introduced. Digital said it would more than doublethe number of computers that can be clustered in a VAX network, from42 to 96.</TEXT></DOC>
