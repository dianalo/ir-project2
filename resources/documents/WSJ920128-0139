Giving consumers an incentive to keep down costs is theone sure-fire way to see that it happens. And the best way toaccomplish that is to see that they are spending their ownmoney. We'd see medical costs fall if consumers hadincentives to treat their medical spending the way they treatspending for any other good.</LP><TEXT>   Here's how it would work: Employers would give eachemployee an annual allowance of, say, $3,000 or so forroutine health care for him and his family -- checkups, sorethroats, sprained ankles, etc. That allowance would go into afund -- call it a medical IRA. If the employee spent less hisallowance in a given year, he could keep it. (More on thatlater.) To protect the employee against the cost of medicalbills above his annual allowance, the employer would continueto buy insurance.   Let's look at how this would work in anaverage-cost-of-living city, such as Peoria, Ill.; Scranton,Pa.; Cincinnati; or Denver.   Currently, an employer in such cities pays an average$4,500 insurance premium to cover an employee and his family;the deductible typically is $100 to $250. The premium for apolicy with a $3,000 deductible, by contrast, would be about$1,500. The employer could then deposit the approximately$3,000 difference in premiums into his employee's medicalcare savings account. The employee would use the money in theaccount to pay for the first $3,000 in annual health carecosts for any family member, with the rest covered byinsurance. Putting real money in the employee's medical-caresavings account effectively deals with his natural fear ofbig deductibles, because he will have employer-provided moneysitting right there in the account to cover the deductible.   The following year, the employee would get an additional$3,000 or so to put into the medical care savings account,and $3,000 or so the year after that -- $9,000 in threeyears; $15,000 in five years.   The medical care savings account would be especiallyhelpful to the financially stressed employee. Today, evenrelatively small deductibles can create a hardship for, say,a divorced woman who is trying to raise two or threechildren. Insurance doesn't pay until she has paid thedeductible first out of after-tax income. With the medicalcare savings account, she'll have money right there withwhich to pay for the first dollar of care. The objective isto have her spend wisely throughout the year, not to causeher hardships when she has to take her children to the doctorin the early part of the year.   For the single employee whose annual account deposit ishalf as much, or for the new employee who in the first fewmonths on the job would not have enough savings in theaccount to cover the deductible, a variety of don't-be-afraidsafeguards could be included. It would be a small matter tooffer employees interest-free loans until the savings hadaccumulated.   One of the arguments for national health insurance is,&quot;What will I do if I lose my job and then don't haveinsurance?&quot; If medical care savings accounts were in generaluse, there would be tax-free money in the accounts to payinsurance premiums between jobs. Half of the uninsured remainuninsured four months or less and only 15% are uninsured foras long as two years. If I lose my job, or if I am out onstrike, there would be money in the medical care savingsaccount to continue my insurance.   Employers could implement such a program today withoutwaiting for the government to make it possible. But they'renot doing so -- because current law makes the money taxdeductible only if spent by the employer. (Some employers nowoffer plans that are something like this, but funds not spentby year's end revert to the employer. The result is that theincentive is for the employee to make sure that the money isspent before the end of the year, adding pressure forever-higher health spending.)   It will take only a fairly simple modification to the taxlaw to let any money the employee has not consumed on medicalcare accumulate tax-free in a medical IRA. No new federalbureaucracy would be needed. Since employers are alreadyspending this money tax-free on insurance premiums, the moneyretained in employee medical IRAs would be tax-neutral.   Such a change in the tax law would be a godsend for smallemployers and their workers. Small employer groups -- evenassociations of small employers -- often must pay prohibitivepremiums because of high claim costs. Examples of familypremiums in this category are $7,920 in Des Moines, Iowa;$9,643 in Chicago; and $8,238 in Washington.   As premiums have escalated, the healthier groups havegradually dropped out of the insurance pool. The ones whohave stayed are the high users. Moderate utilizers haveeither decided to go bare or, in the case of one firm I knowof, the owner-partners have left the group and boughtindividual high-deductible policies on their own. For thesefirms, group insurance is no longer a rational purchase.   To bring health care costs under control, insurance has tobecome a good-sense product again. The combination of themedical care savings account and high-deductible insurancewould bring these costs back into line, and would even bringmany employers back into the insurance system.   As with any IRA, an employee would be allowed to make anearly withdrawal for a nonmedical purpose (a housedownpayment, for instance). The employee would have to pay a10% withdrawal penalty, and the money would become taxableincome. Those taxes are revenue-positive. And, from theemployee's standpoint, the money wouldn't have been there atall without the medical IRA. At age 59 1/2, the employeecould begin to draw income from the medical IRA, at whichtime the resulting income would become taxable and could beused for any purpose.   Wouldn't that be great?   ---   Mr. Rooney is chairman of Golden Rule Insurance Co.
