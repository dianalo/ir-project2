One out of 10 women in the 18-to-34 age range plans toremain childless, according to the survey, while 13% expectto have one child. Nearly half plan to have two children, and30% expect to have three or more.   Many women who expect a large family already have one. Ofthe 7.3 million who say they expect three or more children,nearly half already have at least three. Few of these womenexpect to add to their clans. Among women with three or morechildren, only 12% plan to have another child.   At the other end of the spectrum, 22% of the 10.3 millionwomen in the 18-to-34 age group who currently have nochildren expect to remain childless. Eleven percent ofchildless women plan to have one child, 51% expect two, and17% say they expect to have three or more children.   Some women appear to temper their plans after the arrivalof a first child. Among the 5.3 million women with one child,40% expect to have another, and 39% plan to end up with threeor more. Twenty percent say they are content with the onethey have.   Most of the 5.3 million women who have two children planto stop there. But 21% of this group plans to add one or morechildren.                                                                                                          Moonlighting Serenade   Lures Many Workers                                                                                                          MOONLIGHTING remains at historically high levels.   As of May, 7.2 million Americans, or 6.2% of all employedpeople, were working at more than one job, according to asurvey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was the samepercentage as in 1989 but higher than the 5.4% level of 1985and the 4.9% figure for 1980.   Men are more likely than women to hold more than one job,by 6.4% to 5.9%. But moonlighting by women has surged inrecent years. In 1991, women made up 44% of multiplejobholders, up from 16% in 1970.   Moonlighting is most common among those 35 to 44 yearsold, with 7.2% of men and 6.6% of women in that age rangeholding more than one job. Married men are more likely thanother men to moonlight, at 6.7%. In contrast, married womenare less likely than average to have more than one job(5.0%), while widowed, divorced, and separated women have ahigh rate of moonlighting, at 7.4%.   Most moonlighters have one full-time and one part-timejob. But 23% have two part-time jobs, and 4% hold down twofull-time jobs.   The most common reason for holding more than one job is topay the bills, cited by 31% of those moonlighting. Eighteenpercent say they are trying to pay debts or save for thefuture, 16% say they enjoy their second job, and 8% say theyare gaining experience or building up a business.   Eight percent of moonlighters say they are working anextra job to get money for something special, while 5% saythey are doing so to help out a friend or relative.                                                                                                          Labor-Force Growth   Expected to Ease                                                                                                          GROWTH of the U.S. labor force will slow over the next 15years, but the nation will still add 26 million workers.   According to projections from the Bureau of LaborStatistics, labor-force growth will average 1.3% a year from1990 to 2005, down from 1.9% annually for the past 15 years.Even so, the work force will grow to 151 million people from125 million last year.   Men's rate of participation in the work force is expectedto ease to 75% in 2005 from 76% in 1990. In 1975, 78% of menage 16 and older worked.   Hispanic men are the most likely to work now and areexpected to maintain that standing, with a participation rateof 82% in 2005, compared with 76% for white men, 75% forAsians and 70% for blacks.   Women's work force participation rates will continue torise, to 63% in 2005 from 58% last year and 46% in 1975.Women will make up 47% of the work force in 2005.   In 1990, black women were the most likely to be working,with a rate of 58%, but white women may have the highest rateby 2005, projected at 64%, compared with 62% for blacks, 59%for Asians and 58% for Hispanics.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          EIGHT of the 10 occupations with the greatest projectedjob growth between 1990 and 2005 generally require a highschool education or less, according to the Bureau of LaborStatistics. Over the next 15 years, the bureau projects, theU.S. will need an additional 2.6 million retail salespeople,cashiers, janitors/maids and waiters and waitresses. It willneed only 1.2 million more lawyers, doctors, engineers andwriters/artists/entertainers. . . . Only 45% of Americans ofvoting age said they voted in the 1990 congressionalelections, a recent Census Bureau survey shows. This is downfrom 46% in 1986 but up slightly from 44.7% in 1974.Voter-registration rates also fell between 1986 and 1990, to62.2% from 64.3%. . . . Thirty-five percent of three- andfour-year-old children are enrolled in nursery school,according to an October 1989 Census Bureau survey. Forchildren in households with incomes of $40,000 or more (manyof which include two working parents), the share is 53%.</TEXT></DOC>
