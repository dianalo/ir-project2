It is the latest example of mushythinking about the nature of individual rights in ademocratic society.   Prof. Etzioni assumes, without scrutiny, an oppositionbetween individual rights and what he calls &quot;the commongood.&quot; In his academic world, individual rights are in onecircle and &quot;the common good,&quot; which he nowhere defines, is inanother, entirely &quot;distinct&quot; circle. This imaginary constructallows him to assume a zero-sum game: When claims ofindividual rights are granted, he implies, it is at theexpense of &quot;the common good.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But those who founded this country saw it differently. Forthem, individual rights were part of the common good, notseparate from it and certainly not opposed to it. Indeed, forthe early Americans, individual rights were not only part ofthe common good, they were the highest good. In their view,the primary purpose of government, the reason why agovernment was formed in the first instance, was to secureindividual liberty. Prof. Etzioni's notion that the commongood stands in opposition to individual rights would havestruck the original citizens of this country as bizarre.   This misconception leads the professor to severalmistakes.   For example, he asserts that &quot;individual rights have beenconstrued too widely, to the point they hobble the legitimatework of the police. . . .&quot; He cites no examples. Perhaps hemeans the Fifth Amendment, which recently resulted in thereversal of Oliver North's conviction. Or perhaps he meansthe First Amendment, which was instrumental in reversing LynNofziger's conviction. Maybe he means the Miranda warning orthe exclusionary rule, except that a recent American BarAssociation survey of police chiefs, district attorneys andother law-enforcement officials revealed that theoverwhelming majority of them believe that such rights arenot an impediment to law enforcement. That's police chiefstalking, not the American Civil Liberties Union. Prof.Etzioni seems as out of touch with modern law enforcement aswith the Constitution.   Another example: He decries the fact that the ACLU opposestesting train engineers and pilots for drug abuse. In fact,we support performance testing and have advocated itpublicly. What we oppose is random urine testing, in partbecause it is an intrusive procedure that demonstrablyviolates the rights of many innocent people, but also becauseit doesn't work: Urine testing is incapable of detectingcurrent impairment. Performance testing, on the other hand,does a superb job of detecting current impairment withoutviolating anyone's rights. Yet Prof. Etzioni blurs all thisand prefers to imagine an opposition between individualrights and public safety that need not exist. Ironically,this leads him to support a form of testing that is notnearly as effective in protecting public safety. So anxiousis he to argue against individual rights that he is blind tothis fact.   It is ironic indeed that at a time when the early Americanidea of individual rights as the highest purpose ofgovernment is reasserting itself all over the world -- in theSoviet Union and elsewhere -- Prof. Etzioni would choose torevive in this country the profoundly dangerous and statistnotion that individual rights and the common good occupydistinct and oppositional spheres.   If this be communitarianism, who needs it?   Ira Glasser   Executive Director   American Civil Liberties Union   New York   ---   I found myself in basic agreement with the aims of Mr.Etzioni's article. However, I also found the article odd inthat it ends by pointing to the reasons why its proposals areunrealistic. Mr. Etzioni hopes to &quot;restore the {sic}community's moral and civic order.&quot; The way to do this, heargues, is not through state-imposed remedies, but&quot;recognition in a town meeting&quot; or &quot;a story in the localpaper,&quot; both of which will &quot;make most people want to `behave'. . .&quot;   This smacks of a Norman Rockwell America that no longerexists and, perhaps, never did. More Americans live infaceless apartment buildings, condos and housing tracts thanin towns where rustic but decent folk gather regularly tospeak their minds. And what if your local paper is the MiamiHerald? Mr. Etzioni himself notes that American society is&quot;highly mobile, media-penetrated and pluralistic. . . .&quot;Indeed, it is becoming more so all the time: Workers must gowhere the jobs are; big media is big business; nonwhite,non-Europeans will make up a larger and larger percentage ofthe American public. Any sense of community, however it maybe achieved, will have to live in the midst of these facts.
