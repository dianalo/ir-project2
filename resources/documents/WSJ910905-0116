We seem to beliving in an age where every feeling outside of completebliss is abnormal, where every pain, ache, or concern becomesa syndrome, and where those people or events causing aparticular disturbance are infringing on our right to life,liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   I was an engineering-manufacturing executive for 40 years.In retrospect, there were far, far more stressful days thanunstressful days. But it never occurred to me to quit becauseof stress.</LP><TEXT>   It goes deeper than that. Those I worked with, whoexperienced the same stress I did, never discussed thesubject. We really didn't even know we were under stress; wejust had a job to do and we did it. We did talk about ulcers,but that's about as much as we knew. We used to joke that ourjob was to give ulcers, not get them. Perhaps laughing wasour way of relieving stress.   Modern medicine is wonderful -- not for the diseases it iscuring, but for the diseases it is discovering. Work-inducedstress syndrome is one of them. Perhaps medical research isidentifying these new &quot;syndromes&quot; to replace the diseasesthat no longer occur. After all, if many of the diseases wereto disappear, physicians would become unemployed -- and knowwhat real stress is.   Pardon me if I scoff at those who think about quittingtheir jobs because of stress. One of the reasons it is calledwork is because it is difficult and stressful. Otherwise, itwould be called play. I can't think of any meaningful jobthat brings a sense of accomplishment that does not producestress. Perhaps an artist or composer working quietly in hisor her studio isn't feeling stress, but I have my doubts. Ispend my retirement writing and, believe me, it is stressful.   Anyone in the working world who has a non-stress jobdoesn't have a real job. I don't mean to imply that workshould not be enjoyable, rewarding, fulfilling, and even alittle fun. But work and stress go together, like love andmarriage -- which also produce their share of stress. I wishthe third of Americans who are ready to quit their jobsbecause of stress would do so immediately. Then the thousandsof unemployed people out there, who are tired of the stressof unemployment, can join the ranks of the employed who arethankful for stress and a paycheck.   ---   Mr. Gittler, of Oberlin, Ohio, writes and lectures, withsweaty palms, on management issues.</TEXT></DOC>
