Swede Jan Stening, 44, and Norwegian William Jorgensen, 58, whowere freed by their abductors Tuesday night, made the comments at apacked news conference at a hotel in Christian east Beirut.   ``We were very well treated during the whole period ofcaptivity,'' said Stening. Jorgensen said Stening was speaking for``both of us.''   Stening said neither of them had any idea about the identity oftheir captors, their motives or their demands.   ``All our guards were masked,'' Stening said. ``We changedlocations seven or eight times. We never knew where we were held atany time.''   ``We were held together ... Both of us were blindfolded at thebeginning for an hour or so but then the blindfolds were removedand we were allowed to talk freely to each other,'' Stening said.``We were moved from one location to another at night and in thetrunks of the cars,'' Stening added.   He said their captors ``interrogated us in a polite manner,asking such questions as the names of countries we worked at andthe kind of jobs we had.''   After the news conference, the former hostages left Lebanon in aU.N. helicopter from Christian east Beirut for Larnaca, Cyprus.They then departed Larnaca for Zurich, Switzerland, aboard aregular Swissair flight for their journey home.   Stening said four gunmen kidnapped them near south Lebanon'sprovincial capital of Sidon as they were driving in a U.N. car fromtheir base in the southern port of Tyre to Beirut on Feb. 5.   Asked whether either one could tell if the kidnappers werePalestinians or Lebanese, judging by their accent, Stening said inEnglish: ``No. We haven't the slightest idea. I don't know Arabic.''   The two worked for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which caresfor 280,000 Palestinian refugees in Lebanon.   Jorgensen said ``yes'' when asked whether he would be willing toreturn to work for the agency in Sidon after their ordeal.   John Fennessey of Ireland,the agency's acting director, toldreporters at the news conference that the two former captives``wish to join their families as soon as possible and we're goingto fulfill that'' request.   The first word about the release came in a handwritten Arabicstatement delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut late Tuesday.   It was accompanied by a picture showing the two men. It saidafter they were ``proved innocent, they were released.''   The statement did not say what they had been accused of, but inearlier statements the group claimed the men were involved with theintelligence service of an unidentified foreign power. U.N.officials blamed the abductions on Palestinians acting individuallyfor personal, not political, motives.   The kidnappers of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, whowas abducted in south Lebanon Feb. 17, said in a statement releasedTuesday they would put him on trial. They accused Higgins ofworking for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, which claimedHiggins' abduction, said Israel's crackdown on anti-occupationPalestinian riots in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the MiddleEast trip of U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz ``make usmore determined to try this criminal, Higgins.''   Both the United Nations and the United States have denied thatHiggins, who served with the U.N. peacekeeping force in southLebanon, was a CIA spy.   Reporters in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, said the twoScandinavians were turned over by their abductors at 8 p.m. Tuesdayto Palestine Liberation Organization representative Salah Salah.   They were then driven to Beirut by the militia of leftist SunniMoslem leader Mustafa Saad, who controlled the city since the 1975outbreak of the Lebanese civil war.   Higgins, 43, was abducted near south Lebanon's ancient port ofTyre. He heads a 76-man U.N. observer group that monitors truceviolations on the Lebanon-Israel border under a 1949 armisticeagreement.   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth is believed to bemade up of pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems. It previously claimedresponsibility for kidnapping 12 Lebanese Jews in west Beirut andsaid it killed eight of them.   In all, 23 foreigners are missing after being kidnapped inLebanon since March 1985. They are nine Americans, four Frenchmen,three Britons, two West Germans, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indianand two unidentified men.   Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
