BirnbaumStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate voted to reinvigorate the Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting law as part of a measure that would extend the federal borrowing limit through May 1989.    The bill's approval raises the possibility that across-the-board budget cuts could take effect as early as this fall under a new Gramm-Rudman law. It also could remove the contentious debt-ceiling debate from 1988 election-year politics.    The Senate action isn't final, however, and it isn't clear whether the legislation can be completed by the end of the week, when Congress is expected to leave town for a month's vacation and the current debt ceiling expires.    The current debt ceiling of $2.32 trillion expires at 12:01 a.m. Friday, and the Senate bill would extend it through May 1989 at the level of $2.8 trillion. Unless the debt ceiling is extended, the U.S. is in danger of defaulting on its obligations at midmonth.    The new Gramm-Rudman measure was approved on a 71-21 vote Friday as an amendment to a bill extending the federal borrowing limit. The debt-ceiling bill was passed by a 54-31 vote.    The House hasn't approved its own revisions of the Gramm-Rudman law. What's more, the House-passed borrowing bill would extend the debt ceiling only through September 1988. House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) said he expects to take the Senate-passed measure directly to a House-Senate conference this week and to negotiate a reconciled version of Gramm-Rudman and a debt-ceiling extension.    Still, lawmakers questioned whether such a reconciled bill could be produced in just one week. Some suggested that a short-term extension of the debt ceiling, at least into September, would be needed to keep the government out of default through Congress's August recess.    House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) put the odds of completing a reconciled Gramm-Rudman and debt-ceiling extension prior to the recess at &quot;50-50.&quot; Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas), an author of the Gramm-Rudman law, said final action this week would be &quot;difficult and challenging, but not impossible.&quot;    Many lawmakers are insisting that some sort of fail-safe, deficit-trimming plan such as Gramm-Rudman be put into place before they vote to give the government long-term authority to take on any more debt. The budget deficit is projected to grow to $181 billion next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, from $155 billion in the current fiscal year.    The current Gramm-Rudman law is largely ineffective because a central component enforcing across-the-board spending cuts was struck down by the Supreme Court last year. In addition, its deficit goal of $108 billion for fiscal 1988 has been rejected as politically impossible by both Republicans and Democrats.    The Senate's Gramm-Rudman amendment would impose an automatic spending cut of about $31 billion from projected levels, taken equally from military and nonmilitary programs, unless Congress and the president agree on a deficit-reduction package of that size for fiscal 1988. The deficit reduction in fiscal 1989 would be, at most, $36 billion.    Several anti-poverty programs would be exempt from the cutbacks, and military personnel would get smaller cuts or be exempt. The president also could request from Congress protection from cuts for high-priority military programs. There also is built into the plan a cushion of $10 billion each year, by which the deficit targets could be missed without triggering the across-the-board cuts.    In the Senate bill, the constitutional problems that caused the Supreme Court to strike down Gramm-Rudman were addressed by enhancing the executive branch's participation in the spending cuts.    The House, however, is likely to have a different view of the best Gramm-Rudman law. Rep. Wright said House Democrats would insist, for example, on giving the White House's Office of Management and Budget less authority in determining the size of the Gramm-Rudman cuts than in the Senate-passed measure.    Democrats are pushing for steeper automatic cuts than are the traditionally more fiscally conservative Republicans. The White House and its allies are worried that too large a cutback across the board would hit the president's cherished military programs hardest.    The Senate's Gramm-Rudman proposal was a compromise that resembled an earlier Republican-sponsored idea. On Friday, the Senate rejected a measure sponsored by Sen. Bennett Johnston (D., La.) that would have required more deficit reduction and limited the cushion to $5 billion. The strongly Democratic House has been discussing requiring a minimum of $36 billion in deficit reductions each year, which is harsher than the Senate-passed plan.    The framers of the Gramm-Rudman measure hope the across-the-board cutbacks won't ever happen. Rather, they want to use the threat of automatic cuts to force the Republican president and the Democratic-controlled Congress to come to terms on a compromise deficit-reduction package.    So far this year, Congress and President Reagan have been at loggerheads over a budget compromise. Democrats are insisting on a significant tax increase, which the president has opposed. Gramm-Rudman cutbacks are likely to cut deeply into military spending, which the president would like to protect. </TEXT></DOC>
