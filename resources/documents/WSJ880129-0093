Port City Bank had assets of about $59.7 million when it was closed by the Texas banking commissioner. Its $59.3 million in deposits and its two offices were sold to Channelview Bank, Channelview, Texas, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The FDIC advanced $23.7 million in cash, and assets with a book value of $36.1 million, to Channelview.    The FDIC decided to liquidate the other failed bank, Houston Commerce Bank, after receiving no bids to buy it. Payment to insured depositors will begin tomorrow at the latest, regulators said.    Houston Commerce had assets of $40 million and deposits of $36.6 million. About $337,000 in deposits was uninsured. Owners of these deposits will share proportionately with the FDIC in proceeds of liquidating the failed bank's assets. </TEXT></DOC>
