Haynes told the conference that ``too many of our students noware from the `Now Generation.'   ``They want everything right now. They don't want to pay for it.They don't want to work for it. They just want. That's going tokill us ... unless we correct it.''   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said black institutions nowgraduate 40 percent of all black Americans receiving baccalaureatedegrees.   ``Black colleges have produced tens of thousands of outstandingminority teachers over the years, and can help to develop newprograms for effective teaching in America's culturally andethnically diverse classrooms,'' said Cavazos.   A 1988 Education Department survey of faculties in highereducation institutions found that whites accounted for 89 percentof the 489,164 fulltime regular faculty members and 90 percent ofthe 175,589 part-time regular faculty members.   Asians comprised 4 percent of the fulltime faculty, blacks 3percent, Hispanics 2 percent, and American Indians 1 percent.   The Agriculture Department, meanwhile, said an agreement wassigned with Southern University and Aandamp;M College, Baton Rouge, La.,as part of a campaign to attract more black students to USDAcareers.   Officials said the department's Agricultural Marketing Servicewill oversee about $500,000 in appropriated and private funds nextfiscal year for teaching, research and recruitment of blackgraduates of Southern University.   Deputy Secretary Jack C. Parnell said USDA will hire about 600interns this summer from the 16 historically black land-grantuniversities chartered under the 1890 Morrill Act and from TuskegeeUniversity in Alabama.</TEXT></DOC>
