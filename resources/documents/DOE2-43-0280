Attention is given to signal processing for enhanced opticaltime domain reflectometry, fiber-optic sensors based on resonating mechanicalstructures, photoacoustic oscillator sensors, a fiber-optic white lightbirefringent temperature sensor, a dual-wavelength approach to interferometricsensing, optical waveguide immunosensors, an evanescent wave fiber-opticsensor, a refractometer with inherent turbidity measurement, a fluorescence-baseddissolved oxygen sensor, and a fiber-optic polarization-state controller.</TEXT></DOC>
