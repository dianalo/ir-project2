The advance may lead to new ways to reduce spoilage of fruits and vegetables and thus to get fresher produce to consumers.    The new-found gene produces an enzyme that triggers the production of ethylene, the naturally occurring chemical that ripens fruits and vegetables. It may be possible to block the gene, and thus to halt or slow the ripening of a fruit or vegetable while it is on the plant and in shipment. The produce could be ripened later -- even at the supermarket, for example -- by applying ethylene externally.    In a report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Takahide Sato and Athanasios Theologis said the gene produces an enzyme, called ACC synthase, that triggers the production of the chemical 1-aminocyclopropane-1, which is abbreviated ACC. ACC, in turn, controls the production of ethylene.    To prove their findings, the scientists inserted the gene for ACC synthase into a bacterium and a yeast and found that the two micro-organisms produced ethylene, which they normally don't produce. This, they said, &quot;confirmed the biological activity&quot; of the gene.    The isolation of the mechanism that controls ripening has enormous implications for the agriculture industry. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, about half the produce harvested in the U.S. for sale fresh is lost to spoilage. To prevent such losses, tomatoes and bananas, for instance, are currently picked green, and ripening later is hastened with ethylene. But the early harvest doesn't prevent ripening of the produce, which thus gets damaged during shipment.    The researchers, from the USDA Research Service at Albany, Calif., say that if produce can be prevented from ripening altogether until it reaches the supermarket shelf, much of the loss to spoilage can also be prevented. &quot;By controlling the expression of the gene {for ethylene production} we can grow bananas that simply won't be capable of ripening by themselves,&quot; said Joseph Varner, professor of biology at Washington University in St. Louis, who has been following the work of the USDA scientists.    The researchers said it would be possible to genetically engineer plants to inhibit production of ethylene in their fruits. They emphasized, however, that their research is &quot;preliminary&quot; and that isolation of the gene is only one of many steps toward reducing perishability. They also said that for fruit or vegetables ripened on command, such other factors as taste, texture and aroma also need to be considered. </TEXT></DOC>
