The Moessbauer spectra of samples, heat treated at1000 deg C in hydrogen atmosphere, show a gradual reduction process ofhematite. The main phase of sample aged for 1 h is magnetite, while alpha-ironand some silicates and wustite type oxide can be detected in sample agedfor 3 hs. Further aging of sample results in dissolution of alloyingelements (Si, Al) present in the samples. This process starts even insamples aged at 1000 deg C for 4 hs, but it is more expressed in mineralsheat treated at 1200 or 1300 deg C, when all paramagnetic phases disappeared.(author) 12 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
