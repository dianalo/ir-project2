(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, whoaccused ousted PTL leader Jim Bakker of sexual misconduct, is beinginvestigated by the Assemblies of God church amid reports ofsimilar allegations.   The denomination's 13-member Executive Presbytery met withSwaggart at its headquarters here for nearly 10 hours Thursday ``todiscuss matters that could affect his credentials with thechurch,'' church spokeswoman Juleen Turnage said Friday.   Mrs. Turnage would not give details of the investigation, butsaid it is a ``critical situation'' and that Swaggart iscooperating. The Assemblies of God last year stripped Bakker of hiscredentials.   ABC's ``Nightline,'' citing sources it did not identify,reported early today that church officials at the meeting wereshown photographs purported to show Swaggart and a known prostitutegoing into and out of a motel room.   One unidentified church official told ABC the photos were opento interpretation.   Swaggart did not deny to church officials that he had been witha prostitute, ABC reported. ABC said New Orleans preacher MarvinGorman was believed to have provided the photos to church officials.   The Assemblies of God defrocked Gorman in 1986 for ``immoralityand conduct unbecoming to a minister,'' an unidentified churchofficial told The Washington Post.   CBS News reported Friday that the probe involved allegations ofsexual misconduct, and the Post quoted unidentified sources intoday's editions as saying the investigation involved charges ofadultery.   The Assemblies of God did not comment on the nature of itsinvestigation. Swaggart spokeswoman Barbara Klein said late Friday:``At this point, we don't have a statement.''   Bakker, who was stripped of his credentials as a minister in thechurch following allegations of homosexuality and an extramaritalsexual encounter in 1980 with Jessica Hahn, said Friday night thatthe reports about Swaggart were ``most confusing and hurtful.''   ``I'm shocked,'' he added. ``What we've gone through no one onearth should have to go through.''   Swaggart, 52, is president of a TV ministry worth an estimated$140 million a year. It is based in Baton Rouge, La., andbroadcasts to 143 countries.   Swaggart, interviewed at the Baton Rouge airport upon his returnfrom Springfield, was asked about the nature of the meeting withchurch officials.   ``You'll have to call them and ask them,'' he replied.   When asked about the report of the pictures, he said, ``Call ourattorney if you like.''   Last September, Gorman filed a $90 million suit accusingSwaggart and others of plotting to ruin his TV ministry with falsereports of adulterous affairs. A judge dismissed the suit, sayingit was a religious dispute that didn't belong in court.   Shortly afterward, Gorman's organization, Marvin GormanMinistries, filed for bankruptcy reorganization, claiming debts ofmore than $2 million. He is pastor of the Metropolitan ChristianLife Church in Metairie, La., outside New Orleans.   Calls to Gorman's church in New Orleans went unanswered, andthere is no telephone listing under Gorman's name there.   Swaggart, a Pentecostal minister, has come under scrutinyrecently on several fronts.   In June, a court battle over the tax-exempt status of a Texasradio station belonging to the ministry forced the evangelicalempire to release details of its finances and led to allegationsSwaggart has kept contributions for his personal use.   When Bakker stepped down from PTL last March, he accused a rivalgroup of trying to take over the $172 million TV ministry byexposing his involvement in a sex-and-money scandal. Swaggart wasalleged to be a member of that rival group, but denied thataccusation. Bakker later retracted the charge.   Swaggart, a high-school dropout, is the cousin of singer JerryLee Lewis. He and his wife, Frances, have a son, Donnie. Inaddition to the television ministry, Swaggart has put out more than50 gospel albums and runs one of the largest non-profit mail ordermerchandise businesses in the country.</TEXT></DOC>
