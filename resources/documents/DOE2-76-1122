SREL researchers also makenumerous presentations at professional meetings and symposia, and atcolleges and universities. SREL research concepts, techniques, and findingsare presented to the general public through presentations at local civicand educational organizations and by publishing articles in popular magazinesand newspapers. One of the highlights of this year is the constructionof an addition to the SREL environmental chemistry laboratory. Locatedat the HWCTR facility, the 2400 square foot addition will allow SRELresearchers to conduct research not easily done here now. Research atSREL is conducted by three primary research divisions: the Division ofBiogeochemical Ecology, the Division of Stress and the Division of WetlandsEcology. The biogeochemical Ecology Division researchers strive to understandthe biogeochemical cycling of various contaminants in the environment.The Stress and Wildlife group focuses on the study of natural populationsand communities of animals, with special emphasis on the influence ofhuman-caused disturbances. The Wetlands Ecology group focuses on thestudy of biological community development and the factors that affectthis development in natural and disturbed wetlands. Research is addressedby the research staff of each division in an interactive and collaborativemanner.</TEXT></DOC>
