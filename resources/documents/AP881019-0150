At least 130 people were killed in the airline's 16th majoraccident since it was formed 26 years ago to handle domestictraffic and short flights to neighboring countries.   The worst previous accident for the airlines was in 1976, when aCaravelle aircraft exploded at Bombay airport while landing.Ninety-five people were killed in the crash, blamed on leaking fuelpipes.   In 1973, 49 people died when a Boeing 737 made a crash landingshort of the runway at New Delhi airport.   Indian Airlines is owned by the government, as is Air-India,which operates only on international routes.   Wednesday's crash comes 12 years after the last fatal accidenton the airlines, but some recent reports have criticized safetymeasures.   In June, the pilot of an Indian Airlines plane forgot to lowerthe landing gear before landing at New Delhi. The aircraftslithered along the runway on its belly but no one was hurt.   India Today newsmagazine said in its latest issue that safetymeasures were ignored on Indian Airlines flights and that pilots``exhibited a cavalier disregard for their own and passengers'lives.''   ``Mandatory safety-related procedures are often reduced to apaper exercise,'' the magazine said. ``Doctors who conductpre-flight alcohol tests on pilots sign stacks of reports _ thepilot just fills his name, date and flight number.''   The airline refused comment.   In September 1986, the pilot of an Indian Airlines Airbusaborted takeoff at Madras airport after the nose of the aircraftwas already in the air. Newspaper reports said heavy concentrationsof alcohol were found in the blood of the pilot, the co-pilot andthe engineer of the plane.   Indian Airlines is the largest regional airline in South Asia.It operates flights to 73 airports in India and nine in neighboringcountries.</TEXT></DOC>
