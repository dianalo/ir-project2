De Maiziere scheduled his visit this week _ his first to Americaas leader of East Germany's first democratically elected government_ to speak to Jewish leaders in New York. He will leave Thursday andreturn on June 12.   Bush and de Maiziere likely will discuss the strategic future ofa united Germany. The two German states are to combine theireconomies on July 2, but the global role of a united Germany has yetto be resolved.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is scheduled to meet Bush atthe White House on Friday to discuss the summit and Germanunification, said Detlef Peters, press attache at the West Germanconsulate in New York. Kohl is to deliver the commencement addressat Harvard University on Thursday.   Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev failed to resolvetheir differences over German unification at a weekend summit inWashington, but said they discussed new ways of approaching thequestion.   West Germany spearheads NATO and East Germany is part of theSoviet-led Warsaw Pact. Bush and West German leaders want a unitedGermany to be in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Gorbachevstrongly opposes this.   However, Gorbachev said he and Bush agreed that Germans had theright to decide whether a united Germany should be in NATO, anapparent softening of Gorbachev's stand, a U.S. official said inWashington.   De Maiziere has generally sided with the West and said a unitedGermany could be a NATO member. But he says the military alliancemust be altered to reflect the political changes in the East blocand wants an eventual new European security system.</TEXT></DOC>
