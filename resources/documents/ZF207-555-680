Valletta, STAMIS program executiveofficer.andM;The House committee report said a 1992 renewal of the Army StandardInformation Management Systems (ASIMS), the hardware platform on which someSTAMIS systems run, might cause software development and upgrades to beincompatible.andM;But Valleta said he believes the committee was misinformed because it frozework on 26 software systems that &quot;do not operate in the ASIMS environment.&quot;andM;Brig.andP;  Gen.andP;  Jack Pellicci, commander of the Army's Personnel InformationSystems Command, disagreed with a move to drop all funding for the StandardInstallation Division Personnel System 3 (SIDPERS-3) and the Total ArmyPersonnel Systems (TAPSYS).andM;In the TAPSYS project, contractor Advanced Technology Inc. of Reston, Va.,andO;provides applications on a per-request basis for the Total Army PersonnelDatabase (TAPDB).andP;  The committee agreed with a recent General AccountingOffice finding that the Army awarded the contract to one of the highestbidders although four other companies could do the job.andM;But Pellicci said the Army worked almost five-years to combine databaseswithin the TAP-DB and the contractor was not the highest bidder.andP;  &quot;Weexplained it to the [House Appropriations Committee], and I don't understandwhy their language says what it does,&quot; he said.andM;Pellicci also disagreed with the committee's recommendation that all fundingfor SIDPERS-3 be denied because the program had skirted required MajorAutomated Information Systems Review Council approval.andP;  Both Pellicci andofficials involved in the National Guard's Reserver Component AutomationSystems (RCAS) expressed misgivings about the committee's contention thatSIDPERS-3 might duplicate RCAS functions.andM;Rear Adm.andP;  Paul Tobin, the Navy's senior information resources managementofficial, said severe cuts to Navy ADP could pose serious problems for Navysystems.andM;Of the committee's decision to deny funding to the computer-aideddesign/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM 2) program, Tobin said thecommittee misunderstood the purpose of the funds.andM;The committee decided to eliminate the $19 million request because theestimated contract award date has been delayed until fiscal 1991.andP;  But themoney was intended for individual CAD/CAM procurements.andM;Navy activities can make CAD purchases before CAD/CAM 2 is awarded &quot;as longas they go through the proper Navy channels, but those purchases need to bebudgeted,&quot; Tobin said.andM;The Air Force's Depot Maintenance Management Information System (DMMIS) andReliability and Maintainability Information System were cut by $20 millionand $3.4 million respectively because they lacked approval from the MAISRC.andO;The two systems are the major components of the $12 billion Air Forcelogistics modernization program.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
