But whatwe seek is good quality.''   The tiny, oil-rich Persian Gulf state, which borders theIran-Iraq war zone and is seeking to upgrade its air defenses, hasbeen attacked and threatened by the fundamentalist regime ofAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, which accuses it of aiding Iraq.   Sabah's statement coincided with a report that Kuwait wasdrawing $5.5 billion from its petrodollar reserves to buy newweapons.   He added: ``Kuwait's policy is based on the diversification ofweaponry sources regardless of the manufacturing country.''   Kuwait bought Strela anti-aircraft missiles from the SovietUnion in 1984 after Congress blocked the sale of U.S.-made Stingeranti-aircraft missiles.   Congress has blocked other plans by the administration to selladvanced fighter jets, missiles and other hardware to Arabcountries on the grounds they could be used against Israel.   Congress is expected to decide next month whether to approve orreject the $2 billion sale.   The sale of the F-18, the United States' most sophisticatedfighter-bomber, would be the first to an Arab country. Only Canada,Australia and Spain have purchased the aircraft.</TEXT></DOC>
