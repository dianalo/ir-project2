Deutsche Airbus, which holds 37.9% of the European plane-making consortium, is seeking aid estimated at the equivalent of between $990 million and $1.5 billion.    Even though several multibillion-dollar sales of the new Airbus A320 have been announced this year, the U.S. dollar's decline against the German mark and strong competition from Boeing Corp. of the U.S. have reduced Deutsche Airbus's earnings. In addition, revenue from sales of the older A300 and A310 models will decrease over the next several years, and cash flow from sales of the A320 won't begin until 1988.    A letter from Deutsche Airbus to the Economics Ministry said financing for current production has become so tight that delays in aircraft deliveries or late payments from customers next year could lead to a default, according to newspaper reports. The letter also reportedly ruled out any chance for significant private participation in the consortium through next year.    Dornier G.m.b.H., a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, has been weighing participation in the consortium but hasn't been willing to provide financing without federal subsidies. </TEXT></DOC>
