Wholesale home heating oil prices pulledback.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for thebenchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, West Texas Intermediate,increased 29 cents to settle at $21.51 per 42-gallon barrel. Thecontract had gained 93 cents in the two previous sessions.   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,unleaded gasoline for May delivery spurted 1.78 cents to 73.86cents a gallon, after rising 2.06 cents and 1.21 cents on Mondayand Friday, respectively.   The near-month crude and gasoline contracts are now trading atthe highest levels since January 1986.   May wholesale home heating oil, which rose 0.85 cent Monday,skidded 1 cent and settled at 52.76 cents a gallon.   Several considerations motivated energy brokers to buy Tuesday,said Mary L. Haskins, a vice president at Drexel Burnham LambertInc.   Traders bought partly to adjust their holdings before the Maycrude contract expires on Thursday. A widespread expectation thatweekly industry statistics due late Tuesday would show asignificant reduction in petroleum stocks also encouraged buying asdid a report that output from an oil platform in the North Sea wasdisrupted due to a leak.   Continuing speculation that supplies will be unusually tightthis spring and summer has lent a bullish tone to the energymarkets lately, particularly in the past three weeks since an Exxonoil tanker accidentally spilled 10 million gallons of oil inValdez, Alaska.</TEXT></DOC>
