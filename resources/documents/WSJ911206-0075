The charges against the former thrift operator, who wasconvicted by a statecourt jury here Wednesday on 17 felonycounts of California securities fraud, are likely to focus ona handful of reputedly sham real estate transactions that thegovernment contends he masterminded while serving as chairmanof American Continental Corp., these people said.</LP><TEXT>   They said the indictment is likely to include allegationsthat Mr. Keating violated the Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations Act and other federal laws while heengaged in a scheme to puff up profits at his Phoenix, Ariz.,company and its former Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Associationunit in California.   The federal government is likely to allege that Mr.Keating and key insiders between 1986 and 1988 set up five toseven fraudulent land transactions, in which real estateprojects were purchased by straw buyers at inflated prices,enabling the insiders to post phony profits from the deals.   The likely allegations also involve the use by Keatinginsiders of these illusory profits as the basis for divertingcash from their federally insured thrift, either throughLincoln-backed loans or by direct funding of other landdeals. At the time, Lincoln had a tax-sharing agreement withits parent company that enabled American Continental to drawcash from the thrift if Lincoln appeared on paper to beprofitable.   &quot;The purpose of the fraudulent land transactions was topermit hocus-pocus accounting to make Lincoln and ACC showprofits,&quot; said one person close to the investigation. &quot;It wasall done for the purpose of {providing} cash flow {for} ACC,which in turn {allowed} cash flow {to} the Keating family,&quot;this person added.   Federal regulators disallowed the taxsharing agreement, aprincipal source of revenue for American Continental, inSeptember 1988. In April 1989, the company filed for federalbankruptcy-law protection, and the thrift was seized byregulators soon after.   Mr. Keating's lawyer, Stephen C. Neal, said he hasn't been&quot;informed as to the substance&quot; of the expected charges.However, he said, &quot;I would expect that there would be federalindictments of some people in the very near future, and Ifully expect that Charles Keating Jr. would be among thoseindicted.&quot;   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles,which has been investigating Mr. Keating's business deals fortwo years as part of a joint task force with the FederalBureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, theResolution Trust Corp. and other agencies, had no commentyesterday.   While it isn't yet clear precisely which deals will be thesubject of the anticipated indictment, nor their total value,the collapse of Lincoln has been estimated to cost taxpayers$2.6 billion, making it the most expensive thrift failureever.   Along with Mr. Keating, the other likely indictees includeformer American Continental President Judy Wischer; itsformer chief financial officer, Andrew Liggett; Mr. Keating'sson-in-law and former American Continental senior vicepresident, Robert M. Wurzelbacher; and Mr. Keating's son andformer American Continental executive vice president, CharlesH. Keating III.   Abbe Lowell, Ms. Wischer's lawyer, said, &quot;There will be noevidence against Judy Wischer in any federal case as it wasshown that there wasn't in the state case.&quot; Peter Rosen, alawyer for Mr. Liggett, declined to comment yesterday. MarkBeck, who represents Mr. Wurzelbacher, also declined tocomment. Mr. Neal, who has represented both Keatings in thepast, declined to say whether anyone apart from the elder Mr.Keating is likely to face charges.   The federal government's case goes to the heart of manysimilar allegations in the collapse of thrift institutionsacross the country. By contrast, the criminal proceedings inCalifornia centered on a narrow set of charges that weren'tdirectly related to savings and loan fraud. In that case, Mr.Keating was found guilty of making false statements in thesale of American Continental bonds.   The 68-year-old businessman, who has been free on bailsince September 1990, faces a possible prison sentence of upto 10 years. Mr. Neal has said he plans to appeal the jury'sverdict.   The expected federal indictment and possible long stateprison term aren't the only troubles facing Mr. Keating. Aspreviously reported, the Securities and Exchange Commissionhas approved bringing civil charges against him, and theOffice of Thrift Supervision is seeking $130 million from himand several former associates.   In addition, American Continental bondholders have filed acivil lawsuit to recover some $250 million they claim to havelost. Trial in that case, which has been combined with acivil RICO and fraud action brought by the RTC, is scheduledto begin as early as February in federal court in Tucson,Ariz.</TEXT></DOC>
