Poindexter's lawyers say his high-profile testimony compelled byCongress hopelessly compromised the government's case against theirclient.   However, prosecutors Dan Webb and Howard Pearl said in courtMonday that they were busy with their careers during Poindexter'snationally televised appearances in July 1987.   ``I could not tell you if you held a gun to my head one singlefact'' about Poindexter's testimony, said at a pre-trial hearingcalled by U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene to consider adefense motion that the indictment against Poindexter be dismissed.   Webb, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago, said he was awarePoindexter was a high-ranking Reagan administration official butdidn't know he was the national security adviser.   Pearl said he was ``absolutely sure'' he never watched theIran-Contra hearings because he was tied up at the U.S. attorney'soffice in Chicago handling a criminal investigation of sportsagents.   Both prosecutors, hired within the past few months to handle thePoindexter prosecution, acknowledged they must have seen newsaccounts of the hearings.   Greene took the matter under advisement. Oliver North isscheduled to testify when the pre-trial hearing resumes Dec. 12.   A 1972 Supreme Court ruling bars prosecutors from making any useof a defendant's testimony compelled under a grant of immunity.Poindexter testified under such a grant of immunity about a 1985arms shipment to Iran.   Poindexter is charged with one count of conspiracy, two countsof obstructing Congress and two counts of making false statementsin the Iran-Contra scandal. His trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 22.   He is accused of trying to cover up North's involvement in thesecret Contra resupply effort and of trying to hide the fact thatReagan administration officials knew about a 1985 shipment of Hawkmissiles to Iran at the time it happened. The Hawks shipment wasassisted by the CIA without a signed presidential finding asrequired by law.   Webb, who was in private law practice during the congressionalIran-Contra hearings, said he recalled questions raised in the newsmedia about ``whether President Reagan had ordered subordinates tolie or obstruct Congress.''   Webb said he also remembered questions about ``whether thepresident was involved in arms to Iran for hostages'' and``generally whether the president knew of the diversion of fundsfrom the Iran effort to the Contra aid effort.''</TEXT></DOC>
