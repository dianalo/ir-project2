WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Michael Dukakis today praised theReagan administration as ``growing'' but accused Vice PresidentGeorge Bush of avoiding public stances on major foreign policyissues.   ``I don't think Bush's positions are clear on much ofanything,'' Dukakis declared.   He asserted that President Reagan has moved closer to Dukakis'own positions on crucial issues such as relations with the SovietUnion while Bush has not. Dukakis cited the Persian Gulf, theregional conflict in Southern Africa and the strategic armsreduction talks.   ``It's an administration that's growing. ... Frankly they'recoming a lot closer to where I am'' on such issues, Dukakis said.   ``The INF (intermediate nuclear forces) treaty and Reagan'sapproach to the summit demonstrate a willingness on his part toexplore closer relations with the Soviet Union. It's to his credit.   ``Here's an administration that five years ago was talking `evilempire,''' he said, referring to the words Reagan once used todescribe the Soviets, ``and now the president is walking arm-in-armwith Gorbachev in Red Square.''   Dukakis made the comments to reporters aboard his charteredcampaign jet as he flew to Cincinnati, where he was participatingin the final day of meetings of the National Governors'Association. The Democratic presidential nominee is in his thirdterm as governor of Massachusetts.   While Dukakis offered some praise for Reagan on foreign-policyissues, he leveled a new blast at Bush, the vice president andexpected GOP presidential nominee on those same issues. He saidBush's foreign-policy positions were unclear on all but ``thisendless fiasco in Central America,'' where Bush supports aid to theContra rebels in Nicaragua and Dukakis opposes it.   ``I don't know. Do you know where he stands?'' Dukakis said toreporters. ``I don't think anybody knows where he is on thesethings. ... The only thing he's done is to express some doubt onU.S.-Soviet relations.''   Dukakis attended to his governor's office duties Monday. But ata Statehouse news conference, he faced repeated questioning aboutBush's renewed assault in which the vice president described him asa ``stealth candidate'' who has ignored issues and concealed hisliberalism.   ``I think the way I'm going to win the presidency is not byresponding every day to what some speechwriter has put in front ofMr. Bush,'' Dukakis said. ``It's going to be by defining myself, myparty, my values, this country, its future, and the kind of societyI think all Americans want.''   But pressed by reporters, Dukakis offered a response anyway.   ``George Bush has some of the highest negatives ever recorded inthe history of American politics, and I think one of the reasonsfor it is people have seen his campaign as an essentially negativecampaign,'' Dukakis said.   Dukakis, who has enjoyed big leads in recent polls, said voterswere looking for positive expressions of what a candidate plannedto do as president _ and suggested Bush has not been doing that.   ``I don't think they're interested in a daily diet of this kindof thing, and it's one of the reasons, at least at this point, theRepublican campaign seems to be in trouble,'' he said.   Dukakis planned to campaign in Northeastern states Thursday andFriday before spending the weekend vacationing on Cape Cod with hiswife Kitty.   The campaign was preparing for next week's Republican NationalConvention in New Orleans, where Dukakis is expected to be theobject of criticism and derision. Dukakis aides were suggestingthey expected to see much of Dukakis' double-digit lead over Bushin recent polls evaporate in the week of Republican exposure.   But Dukakis, following the lead of Bush, planned to head out ona four-day campaign swing nex week beginning Wednesday, the thirdday of the GOP convention. Bush broke with the tradition of notcampaigning during the rival's convention week by venturing outduring the Democratic convention three weeks ago.   At his news conference, Dukakis recalled an 8-year-old blastthat Bush leveled at Ronald Reagan, before Bush joined Reagan onthe 1980 GOP ticket, as the governor's response to Bush's charge helacked foreign policy experience.   ``He made the same comment about the Republican candidate forthe presidency in 1980, and he's now trying to succeed him. So whatcan I say?'' Dukakis said.   His aides distributed copies of a 1980 newspaper story thatquoted Bush as saying of Reagan: ``We cannot take a chance onanother president who has absolutely no experience in foreignaffairs.''</TEXT></DOC>
