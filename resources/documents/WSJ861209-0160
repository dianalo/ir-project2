Donovan wrote of the &quot;Lost Politeness&quot; he encountered from a telephone receptionist when he returned a business phone call.    Unfortunately, in many offices, receptionist is an entry-level job. Very often the receptionist is just beginning to learn the nature of the company's business, and has even less knowledge of the functions of the various departments. This is the cause of the runaround that we get when we call a company that is new to us and we don't have the name of a specific individual.    Many executives have perceived this, and a substantial number behave boorishly to receptionists. If the unfortunate employee has fielded a half-dozen such hostile callers during a typical morning, it's small wonder that she or he might be a bit surly.    Because the typical receptionist is often the lowest-paid employee in the office, she cannot afford to dress as well as the secretaries in their remote offices beyond the front desk, who are seldom seen by the public. The receptionist might even be nursing a case of resentment.    A receptionist often gives a caller or visitor the first impression of a company. Many people consider it a reflection of management. It seems to me sensible to utilize the talents of a secretary who has been with the company long enough to have sufficient knowledge of the business and organizational structure so that she can be helpful to potential customers or clients. Such a person can also be depended upon to appear neat and well-groomed, and to behave courteously. The person at the front desk could be an important asset to the company.    Anna C.
