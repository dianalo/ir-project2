The two-day conference of the 10-nation organization, whichincludes the seven Soviet bloc countries, Cuba, Mongolia andVietnam, is the first after last month's ouster of Romaniandictator Nicolae Ceausescu and the decline of Communist powerelsewhere in Europe.   Founded in 1949, COMECON _ the Council for Mutual EconomicAssistance _ aimed to ensure the Marxist members' economic growthso they could match or even outshine the West.   But 41 years later, COMECON, largely because of the unwieldinessof central planning and the absence of profit-basedenterpreneurship and vision, needs a radical overhaul or it willcrumble.   Critics say COMECON is nowadays nothing more than a means forits member states to survive the free-market evils of anincreasin7lE competitive world economic system.   The bloc isn't held together by Socialist solidarity, they say,but by Eastern Europoai countries' inability to earn enough hardcurrency to buy energy and raw materials from anywhere but theSoviet Union.   Czechoslovakia and Romania have now closed ranks with Hungary'sreformers and Poland's Solidarity-led government, which have calledfor an end to trade based on fixed quotas and prices, barter and anon'chnvertible currency _ the Soviet ruble.   ``COMECON is an obsolete organization. It has never worked anddoesn't work now,'' Romania's interim Premier Petre Roman saidMonday. ``COMECON must adjust and change if it is to continue.''Roman is to lead the Romanian delegation in Sofia.   Czechoslovakia's new Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus warned lastThursday that his country would unilaterally cancel its COMECONcommitments if radical changes weren't made to the non-convertiblepayments system.   According to Hungary's Deputy Premier Peter Medgyessy, COMECON,``organized under the myth of friendship and brotherhood, is nolonger capable of serving either the developoment of its members orthe integration of the Central and Eastern european region.''   In an interview published Monday with the Hungarian governmentdaily Magyar Hirlap, Medgyessy said COMECON was born and has been apreserved as a result of a divided Europe.   Its archaic system ``has removed its members from the tide ofthe world economy,'' he was quoted as saying.   Hungary, in an attempt to slash its trade surplus with theSoviet Union, announced last week it would cut its exports to theSoviet Union by 20 percent.   Medgyessy said barter of Soviet energy for Eastern Europeangoods and farm produce at pre-negotiated prices paralyzedcompetition, slowed technological advances and caused consumergoods shortages in some member states.   Hungary has already proposed to trade with the Soviets on adollar basis, rather than on a ruble-only basis.   Czechoslovakia and Poland last week already decided to establishbilateral trade agreements and link their currencies, the korunaand zloty, bypassing the ruble.   Hungary envisages an initial integration of Polish, Czechoslovakand Hungarian economies within the bloc because they are similar insize and economic development.   Medgyessy said free trade agreements should lead to joint tradepolicies, free flow of labor and capital, the harmonization offinancial systems and the creation of a fully convertible currencyunit.   Similar steps are being taken by the European EconomicCommunity, which plans to unite 12 Western economies in a singleEuropean market after 1992.   Although COMECON and the EC established official relations in1988, Brussels still doesn't recognize the Moscow-basedorganization as its equal because COMECON has no lawmaking bodylike the Community's European Parliament, empowered to adopt policyfor member states.   Meanwhile, COMECON secretary Vyacheslav Sychov said the tradingbloc should push for more freedom for individual members to tradeoutside COMECON and for it to seek closer relations with the EC.</TEXT></DOC>
