MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For Gov. Michael Dukakis, it was a good openingday's work at the Democratic National Convention _ a ``no deal''deal with Jesse Jackson.   Dukakis coped with his only major convention problem withoutyielding on points his Democratic ticket cannot afford to concede,and without the sort of confrontation that could have alienatedJackson's largely black constituency.   Indeed, his Peachtree Street summit meeting may have solved aproblem for Jackson, too, by providing the defeated presidentialcandidate with a graceful exit after his certain loss in the rollcall that will nominate Dukakis on Wednesday night.   Jackson came away from a session that lasted nearly three hourson Monday saying that he intends to work for the ticket, that hewants to be supportive and complementary.   He, Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who is getting thevice presidential nomination Jackson also wanted, appeared togetherand said all the proper things.   They talked about teamwork, a better relationship,understanding, trust _ and very few specifics. ``There is no dealand there is no fine print,'' said Dukakis. ``That is not the wayyou win elections.''   Not with Republicans watching for concessions that would enablethem to say that Dukakis had buckled under to the Jackson wing.   ``Who is going to be the coach?'' asked Ed Rollins, former WhiteHouse political adviser and now a GOP ``truth squad'' observer inAtlanta. ``Is Jesse Jackson going to call the shots?'' Rollins saidthat would turn off a lot of voters.   Dukakis said in advance that he would be calling the Democraticplays. He did on Monday, with gestures and concessions to reassurethe Jackson wing. He conceded nothing of major significance.   Party sources say the two camps reached an agreement on platformdisputes, under which Jackson will withdraw 10 of the 13 minorityplatform planks that were to be debated tonight.   Dukakis will ask his delegates to vote down his rival's call forhigher taxes on the wealthy and no first use of nuclear weapons.Jackson's call for a Palestinian homeland will be debated, and isexpected to be withdrawn without a vote, the sources said.   Jackson's major convention address also is scheduled tonight.   There was another gesture in Dukakis' telephoned invitation toJackson to the peace summit before, not after, the challenger's owncandidacy has ended. Jackson isn't endorsing the ticket because hestill is running against it. He said he's still looking for amiracle, and that when it doesn't happen, his campaign will passover into a new phase.   That phase will get financial and staff help from the victors.Jackson will have chartered airplanes for campaign missions in thefall.   He got the same thing four years ago from the campaign of formerVice President Walter F. Mondale.   Dukakis hinted at a role for Jackson in a future Democraticadministration, calling him a great leader ``and we hope in Januarypart of the American government.'' But campaign chairman PaulBrountas said there was no agreement on a role for Jackson or hispeople in a Dukakis transition or administration. He said thatwould flow from natural evolution in a cooperative, winningcampaign.   Jackson's camp was promised a bigger role on the DemocraticNational Committee, but at the bottom, not the top. When 25at-large members are appointed on Friday, Jackson supporters willget about a dozen seats.   But they will not have one of their own installed as chairman orco-chairman to replace or to share authority with chairman PaulKirk. There will apparently be a new, top level voter registrationposition to be filled by a Jackson ally.   Dukakis representatives had agreed in advance to Jackson demandson another front _ changes in the way Democratic nominatingdelegates are elected. The Jackson-backed revisions, approved bythe convention Monday night without dissent, have the effect ofrequiring that delegates be awarded more closely in proportion tothe popular vote in primary elections.   In addition, the rules cut back sharply on the number ofconvention seats set aside for party leaders and officeholders, andleft uncommitted by the primary process. The idea was to create anindependent bloc of office-holding delegates. The assumption wasthat they would align with the candidate most likely to win thegeneral election.   The 643 super delegates at this convention are for Dukakis, 10to 1. At the next convention there will be 394.   ``We negotiated new rules for 1992,'' said Jackson.   That makes no practical difference to Dukakis. If he wins onNov. 8, he will be up for renomination, and it will be no contest.If he loses, the 1992 field will belong to other candidates.   One of them, surely, would be Jesse Jackson.</TEXT><TEXT>   _   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Walter R. Mears, executive editor of TheAssociated Press, has covered national politics for 25 years.</TEXT></DOC>
