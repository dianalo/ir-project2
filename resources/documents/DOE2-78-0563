An historical overview indicatessignificant growth in exports to the USA since 1960, and Canadian gasis getting a bigger share of that country's market. Over 90% of theseexports leave Canada through four major export points. Prices of thisgas are comparable to domestic prices and are competitive in the Americanmarket. In a discussion of the future of gas exports, a number of factorsare proposed as favoring Canadian gas as continuing to be an integralpart of the gas supply situation in the USA. These factors include decliningreserves and deliverability in the USA, increased environmental awarenessof the desirability of gas as a fuel, pipeline proposals in the USA whichinclude Canadian gas as a supply source, and changing regulations withrespect to gas marketing. Constraints to increasing Canadian exportsare also outlined, including the size of the Canadian resource base,Canadian domestic demand, export pipeline capacity, and price competition.5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
