These uncertainties concernfuture load growth; the performance and lifetimes of existing generatingplants; and the costs, lead times, and performance of new demand andsupply resources. Conservation programs can both provide cost-effectiveresources and reduce uncertainties. Programs that improve the energy-efficiencyof new residential, commercial, and industrial buildings reduce uncertaintyabout the effects of economic growth on load growth. Different typesof programs aimed at new buildings affect differently the uncertaintiesassociated with consumer decisions concerning the technical efficienciesof new buildings. For example, standards that require new buildings touse less than a certain amount of electricity per unit floor area reduceuncertainty related to decision making by the builders and owners ofnew buildings. Rebates that help pay for efficiency improvements havea much smaller effect than do standards on these decision-making uncertainties.Considering the uncertainties associated with both economic growth andconsumer behavior also shows that standards reduce uncertainties morethan do rebates. 24 refs., 17 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
