Prices for petroleum futures and contracts for refined productshad soared on Thursday as traders reacted to reports that theScotland rig explosion would affect about 12 percent of total NorthSea production, or as much as 300,000 barrels of oil per day.   In addition, there was concern that the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting countries might call an emergency meeting todiscuss overproduction among some of its members.   ``I think they over-reacted to the effects of the platform fireand they realized it really didn't mean that much ... and the gainswere given back,'' said James R. Steele, an energy analsyt withRefco Inc. ``I think the market also realized there wasn't going tobe an emergency meeting.''   As a result, he said, Friday's trading was highlighted byprofit-taking and a general correction from Thursday's overboughtcondition.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for Augustdelivery of West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 37 cents to$15.46 per 42-gallon barrel after closing 47 cents higher onThursday. The contract had traded well above $16 during thatsession.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, home heating oilfell 0.90 cent to 43.39 cents a gallon.   Unleaded gasoline rose 0.05 cent to 53.17 cents a gallon.Analysts attributed the slight rise to reports of strong seasonaldemand.</TEXT></DOC>
