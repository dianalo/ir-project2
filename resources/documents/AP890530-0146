STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The leftist West Berlin mayor whogoverns with the help of an anti-NATO party was noticeably absentfrom the guest list at Tuesday's state dinner for President Bush.   While Mayor Walter Momper has said Bush would be welcome tovisit his city, some of Momper's partners in his coalitiongovernment don't feel the same _ and they said so in a statementless than two months ago.   While Momper was being snubbed at Tuesday night's feast, thecity's former conservative mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, was prominenton the guest list. He joined 150 business, political and culturalleaders for a gourmet meal of turbot and creamed asparagus at anelegant 18th-century villa in Bonn.   Momper spent the night in communist East Berlin attending aconcert by the famed Berlin Philharmonic under the direction ofMetropolitan Opera conductor James Levine.   West Berlin legally remains under the control of World War IIAllies France, Britain and the United States, although day-to-dayadministration is left to the Germans.   The three Allies maintain military forces in the city, locateddeep inside communist East German territory. U.S. officialsroutinely stress their commitment to guaranteeing West Berlin'ssecurity and its links to the West.   West Berlin officials said they were stunned that Momper was notinvited and charged that the government had snubbed the entire cityby inviting Diepgen instead.   Diepgen is a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ChristianDemocratic party, but he lost power after the Berlin elections inJanuary.   Momper, a Social Democrat, heads a coalition government thatincludes the far-left environmentalist Alternative List party. TheAlternative List in April said it would oppose a Bush visit to WestBerlin during his current European swing, although Momper assertedthe president would be welcome.   Hans-Jochen Vogel, who heads the leftist Social DemocraticParty, said he was ``amazed'' that Diepgen was invited and notMomper.   Momper told reporters in West Berlin that the decision was``alienating and incredibly impolite.''   Vogel, who was invited to the dinner, said he planned to deliver``heartfelt greetings'' from Momper to Bush and suggest to thepresident that he meet another time with Momper.   West German television showed Bush greeting Diepgen with a broadsmile and a handshake at a reception before the dinner.   Bush told reporters after arriving in Bonn that he would addressthe status of Berlin during a speech in the city of Mainz onWednesday.   Then-President Ronald Reagan, during a visit to Berlin in 1987,proposed a wide-ranging plan to ease tensions in the divided cityand revitalize it into an international magnet for trade andsporting events.   Government spokesman Ulrich Strempel said Momper was not invitedto the banquet because of limited seating arrangements at thebanquet hall.   Strempel said many politicians were not invited to make room forrepresentatives from politics, industry and the arts.</TEXT></DOC>
