Nevertheless, in view of the Commission's experience inoverseeing these systems, the Commission believes that it is appropriateto reassess some of the assumptions underlying its approach in this area.Several commentators have criticized the Commission's current policy ofaddressing these matters through staff no-action letters.\6\<NOTE/> Specifically, these commentators have suggested that suchan approach could provide an unfair competitive advantage for systems operatingpursuant to a staff no-action position in relation to registered securitiesexchanges or associations offering competing products and services.\7\<NOTE/> In addition, several of the same commentators raised concernsthat the use of such relief did not provide them with the notice and commentprocedures required in Commission rulemaking.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See</T3> letters from: Walter E.

Moreover, the Commission recognizes that many proprietarytrading systems are becoming increasingly complex. The Commission is concernedthat the imposition of regulatory conditions in a no-action approach tosystems linked to foreign markets may be inadequate to ensure the viabilityand quality of intergovernment and intermarket surveillance and enforcementenhancements, such as international information sharing arrangements. Moreover,there have been instances in which operators of certain trading systemshave failed to request no-action positions.In light of the commentators' concerns and the Commission's experiencein administering the current no-action approach, the Commission has determinedto reexamine its procedures. The Commission, therefore, is proposing Rule15c2-10, which would provide a direct regulatory scheme for proprietarytrading systems.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>Over the past twenty years, the Commission has explored ways to respondto the activities of proprietary trading systems. In 1969, Instinet beganoperating a computer/communications network to be used by professionalinvestors to effect large block trades.\9\<NOTE/> In response, at that time, the Commission proposed Rule 15c2-10to require such an automated trading and information system to file withthe Commission a plan describing the system, setting forth its rules, andproviding for adequate recordkeeping.\10\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Instinet currently is a subsidiary of Reuters HoldingsPLC, a London-based news and financial data company. As originally operated,the Instinet system allowed subscribers to enter offers to buy and sellsecurities, as well as acceptances of such offers and counteroffers. Allinformation was entered into the system anonymously through code numbers.Although the Instinet customer base primarily was institutional, Instinetmade its services available to anyone who was ``financially responsible'',including broker-dealers. Any security could be traded through the system,and there were no market makers, floor brokers, or other traditional ``exchange-type''participants. Instinet continues to allow its participants to accept ``live''orders, and, in addition, has expanded its system to initiate a ``crossingnetwork'' in which buy and sell orders for portfolios of securities arematched with one another. <T3>See infra</T3> n. 15.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 8661 (August 4, 1969),34 FR 12952, regarding Proposed Rule 15c2-10.Instead of adopting the proposed rule, however, the Commission determinedthat Instinet could be appropriately regulated as a broker-dealer. TheCommission determined that: (1) Instinet, unlike registered exchanges,operated on a for-profit basis with no members; (2) Instinet had no ``exchange-type''market participants, such as market makers or floor brokers; (3) customersfurnished all quotes and orders themselves, through the Instinet facilities;and (4) Instinet did not seem to fit within the statutory scheme contemplatedfor exchanges.Rule 15c2-10 was withdrawn in 1975, when the Commission adopted Rule 11Ab2-1,providing for the registration of securities information processors (``SIPs'').The Commission believed that Rule 15c2-10 was no longer necessary in lightof the regulatory scheme provided by the 1975 Amendments.\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 11673 (September 23, 1975),40 FR 45422. After Instinet's registration as a broker-dealer, the Commissiondetermined to regulate certain automated trading and information systemsas facilities of either an exchange or an association. For example, in1978, the Commission examined the status of the Cincinnati Stock Exchange's(``CSE'') National Securities Trading System (``NSTS''). The CSE arguedthat NSTS should be treated as a facility of an exchange, in part, so thatit could trade listed securities without concerns regarding off-board tradingrestrictions. The Commission approved operation of the NSTS, and determinedthat exchange off-board trading restrictions would not prohibit users ofthe NSTS from trading multiple-listed stocks, and, thus determined to treatthe system as a facility of an exchange. Similarly, in 1981, the Commissiontreated the Computer Assisted Execution System (``CAES'') of the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') as an NASD facility,therefore obviating the need for duplicative registration.In the early 1980s the Commission responded to the expanding number ofautomated trading systems operating in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') marketby reviewing its actions with respect to such systems. On October 4, 1984,the Commission concurred in the staff's recommendation that the Divisioninform the sponsors of automated OTC execution systems that the Divisionwould consider granting no-action positions with regard to the Act's definitionof the term ``exchange''.\12\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Section 3(a)(1) of the Act defines the term ``exchange''as:<ITAG tagnum="28">Any organization, association or group of persons, whether incorporatedor unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market placeor facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securitiesor for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonlyperformed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood, andincludes the market place and the market facilities maintained by suchexchange.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">For a discussion of the intended scope of this definition as sketchedin the legislative history of the Act, </ITAG><T3>see</T3> the April 17, 1934 Report of the Senate Committee on Bankingand Currency (``1934 Report''), S. Rep. No. 792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 14,<T3>infra</T3> note 29.Subsequently, on August 8, 1986, the Commission discussed the staff's no-actionpositions regarding the non-registration as exchanges of certain proprietarytrading systems, including the planned Security Pacific system for thetrading of options on government securities. While it determined not toobject to the Division's advising Security Pacific of its determinationto grant a no-action position with respect to Security Pacific's operationof the system, the Commission also recognized the limitations of the no-actionapproach and directed the Division to prepare for Commission considerationa release proposing for comment a rule to regulate proprietary tradingsystems.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Current Systems</ITAG>The staff has granted no-action positions to eleven proprietary tradingsystems.\13\<NOTE/> The systems include several automated execution systems fortrading common stocks, and trading and information systems for common stocks,limited partnership interests, and municipal bonds.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Ten of the eleven systems are sponsored by either: (1)broker-dealers registered pursuant to section 15(b) of the Act (``registeredbroker-dealers'') or section 15C of the Act (``government securities broker-dealers'');(2) entities affiliated with registered broker-dealers; or (3) entitiesin the process of registering as broker-dealers under section 15(b). Theeleventh system was proposed to be operated by Security Pacific, a nationalbank subject to supervision by the Comptroller of the Currency. As noted<T3>infra</T3>, Security Pacific sold its system to RMJ Securities (a registeredgovernment securities broker) in December 1987; a subsidiary of SecurityPacific now serves as the facilities manager of the registered clearingagent of the RMJ system. As a consequence, investors and intermediariesusing the services of these systems benefit from the panoply of protectionsthat accrue from broker-dealer and government securities dealer registrationunder the Act or from oversight by the Comptroller of the Currency.Three of the trading systems for common stocks that have received no-actiontreatment from the Commission facilitate the trading of both exchange-listedand OTC stocks. For example, the Instinet system provides market informationand order routing and execution services to foreign and domestic institutions,broker-dealers, specialists, and market makers.\1\\4\<NOTE/> The system also permits institutional and broker-dealer negotiation,as well as execution of large blocks and smaller trades.\1\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ Prior to October 19, 1987, the Instinet system hasthe capacity, through a network of exchange specialists and OTC marketmakers, automatically to execute market orders of up to 1,000 shares ofexchange-listed and OTC equity securities. On October 19, 1987, Instinentdiscontinued the automatic execution feature because of complaints frommarket makers about the increased exposure to loss precipitated by automaticexecutions during the market break. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ <T3>See </T3>Instinet no-action letter, <T3>supra</T3> note 3. Since this no-action letter was granted, Instinethas begun to open as early as 3:00 a.m. est (<T3>see</T3> letter from Murray L. Finebaum, President, Instinet, to RichardG. Ketchum, dated May 29 1987), instituted a ``Crossing Network'' allowingthe execution of orders for groups of stocks, and included a small groupof American Depository Receipts not authorized for quotation on the NASDAuthomated Quotations system (``non-NASDAQ stocks'') in its system. Another system, POSIT (Portfolio System for Institutional Trading), sponsoredby Jefferies and Company, Inc. (``Jefco''), a registered broker-dealer,permits the trading of portfolios of exchange-listed and OTC securitiesby institutional customers with substantial securities portfolios, <T3>e.g., </T3>mutual funds, insurance companies, commercial banks andpension funds.\1\\6\<NOTE/> The system permits its subscribers to post an indicationof interest to be matched on a confidential basis against other ordersin the system. After reviewing the matched order to determine whether theorder should be executed as matched, Jefco either executes the order orcontacts the subscribers to seek a modification of the order. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ <T3>See</T3> POSIT no-action letter, <T3>supra </T3>note 3. Finally, the staff issued a non-action letter to Exchange Services, a broker-dealerthat sponsored a system to facilitate trading in NYSE-listed and NASDAQissues. \1\\7\<NOTE/> The proposed system would have permitted its retail customersto obtain quotes when the primary markets were closed, <T3>e.g., </T3>evenings and weekends, and to enter agency orders into thesystem. The system then would have matched the order with others in thesystem and executed it, if a match was found, or stored the order untilthe markets reopened, if the customer had so chosen. The system never operated.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ <T3>See </T3>Exchange Services no-action letter, <T3>supra</T3> note 3. An additional three systems that have received no-action treatmeant facilitiesthe trading of OTC secutities listed on NASDAQ.\1\\8\<NOTE/> With some variations distinguishing them, INside, sponsoredby Troster Singer Corp., Tran, sponsored by Transaction Services, a subsidiaryof Gruntal, Inc., and the Customer Order Protection System (``COPS'') sponsoredby Bandamp;K Securities, Inc., permit subscribing broker-dealers to obtainautomated execution at the inside NASDAQ price for orders up to specifiedsize limits.\1\\9\<NOTE/> Of the three, only INside and Tran remain in operation.\2\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ In a development related to the operation of automatedexecution systems for OTC securities, NASD Market Services, Inc. (``MSI'')commenced operation of its Advanced Computerized Execution System (``ACES,).ACES, acting through MSI as its facilities manager, allows individual marketmarkers to automate their internal execution functions and to manage theirinventory. ACES provides a variety of capabilities to subscribers, includingautomated execution, maintenance of a limit order file, intraday tradecorrections and maintenance and control of traders' positions in individualsecurities. With MSI maintaining the necessary computer switches and transmissionlines, each subscriber markets its unique version of ACES to order entryfirms. <T3>See</T3> letter from Frank Wilson, Executive Vice President and GeneralCounsel, NASD, to Richard G. Ketchum, dated May 12, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ <T3>See </T3> no-action letter issued to: (1) Troster, Singer; (2) TransactionServices; and (3) Bandamp;K Securities, Inc., <T3>Supra</T3> note 3. Primarily, the distinctions are based on the sizeof the orders accepted for automatic execution. For example, Inside acceptsfor automatic execution orders of varying sizes, depending upon the liquidityof a particular issue; Inside also limits orders to those issues in whichits sponsor and any other invited market maker makes a market. Tran's ordersize depends upon the selling price of the issue, <T3>i.e., </T3>order sizes of up to 1,000 shares are permitted for issuesselling above one dollar while orders up to 2,000 shares are permittedfor issues selling at less than one dollar. COPS would have accepted eitherprincipal or agency orders of up to 1,099 shares; retail agency orderstook precedence over principal or market maker orders. COPS also includedan open limit order book available to all participants; however, participantswere not able to identify another subscriber's order. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ The Division also recently isued a no-action letterto Petruzzi and Associates (``PA''), a partnership operating as a broker-dealer,which proposes to trade NYSE-listed stocks, bonds and warrants. Althoughit will not disseminate quotatons for securities, PA will permit its customers,who are intended to be small, individual investors, to place orders withPA for NYSE-listed securities; those orders will be filled from the inventoryof a fund managed by PA or with which PA has a contractual relationship.The price for the securities will be the NYSE closing price for the applicablesecurity on the day that the order is placed. The system has not yet commencedoperations. Four organizations receiving no-action letters sponsor or sponsored proprietarytrading systems for non-equity securities.\21\<NOTE/> Of particular note, the staff extended no-action positionsto the proposed Security Pacific system for trading options on governmentsecurities, and to its successor as owner and operator of the system, RMJSecurities Corporation (``RMJ Securities'').\22\<NOTE/> Security Pacific developed a quotation and settlement systemfor put and call options on U.S. Treasury securities. Security Pacific,however, never began operating the system; although Security Pacific receivedthe necessary approval to operate the system from the Federal Reserve Board,banking legislation \23\<NOTE/> imposed a moratorium until March 1, 1988, on expansion bycommercial banks into securities, real estate, and insurance activities.The moratorium applied to the Security Pacific system.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ <T3>See </T3>no-action letters issued to: (1) Adler; (2) NAPEX; (3) SecurityPacific; and (4) RMJ, <T3>supra </T3>note 3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ <T3>See </T3>Security Pacific and RMJ no-action letters, <T3>supra </T3>note 3.

Section 201(b)(2)(C), 101 Stat. 581-82, 584 (Aug.10, 1987).On December 1, 1987, Security Pacific sold the system to RMJ Securities.The sale conveyed to RMJ Securities ownership of the computer software,other proprietary rights associated with the system, and the right to actas the exclusive operator of the system.\24\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ <T3>See</T3> letter from Robert A. McTamaney, Carter, Ledyard andamp; Milburn,counsel for RMJ Securities, to Brandon Becker, dated February 4, 1988 (requestfor staff no-action position) (``RMJ no-action request'').The system as operated by RMJ Securities is made up of: (1) a newly-formedDelaware corporation [Delta Government Options Corp. (``Delta'')], whichissues the options contracts and provides clearing services to participants;\25\<NOTE/> and (2) a brokerage subsidiary of RMJ Securities Corp. [RMJOptions Trading Corp. (``RMJ Options'')]. The RMJ system is designed, throughthe interaction of these components, to permit broker-dealers, banks, andother institutions to trade non-standardized options on U.S. Treasury bills,notes, and bonds with one another, on either an anonymous or fully-disclosedbasis.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ On July 29, 1988, Delta filed with the Commission anapplication for registration as a clearing agency pursuant to Section 17Aof the Act, and an accompanying request for exemption from several of thesubstantive requirements of that Section. Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 25956 (July 29, 1988), 53 FR 29536. That application was subsequentlyamended by Delta on October 7, 1988. Securities Exchange Act Release No.26172 (October 12, 1988), 53 FR 40816. The Commission on January 12, 1989,granted Delta temporary registration as a clearing agency for a periodof three years. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26450 (January 12,1989), 53 FR 2010. (For a further discussion of the clearing services providedby Delta, <T3>see </T3>that release).In addition to its function as clearing agent for the system, Delta alsoissues the options traded through the system and establishes margin requirementsand trading and position limits for participants. RMJ Options disseminatesbid and ask quotations on the options through a computerized communicationsnetwork; at the discretion of the participants, RMJ Options either: (1)Executes the trade at the quoted price on an anonymous basis, or (2) permitsthe participants to negotiate the trade directly with one another, on afully disclosed basis. Further, RMJ Options generates trade reports fortransactions executed through the system, calculates margin and premiumsdue from participants in light of the positions they have taken, and instructsDelta's facilities manager, Security Pacific National Trust Co. (``SPNTCO'')as to whether, and in what amounts, funds are due to be paid. Finally,Delta (acting through its agent SPNTCO) and RMJ Options arrest any transactionthat fails to match, breaches a trading or position limit, or has beenentered by a defaulted participant.\26\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ By letters, dated February 4, 1988 and June 17, 1988,RMJ Securities requested that the staff issue a no-action letter similarto the ones issued to Security Pacific in 1985 and 1986, regarding non-registrationof the RMJ system as a national securities exchange pursuant to Section3(a)(1) and 6 of the Act.

The Need for Regulation</ITAG>The Commission long has recognized that there must be some practical limitationson entities encompassed within the broad definition of the term ``exchange''.\2\\7\<NOTE/> Nonetheless, the definition of the term ``exchange'' in section3(a)(1) of the Act presents interpretative questions because of the phrase``facilities [\2\\8\<NOTE/>] for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities.''Read broadly, this phrase would incorporate many of the activities of OTCmarket makers \2\\9\<NOTE/> and brokers' brokers for government and municipal securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ <T3>Supra </T3>note 14. In a general analysis of the bill, the 1934 Reportstated that most of the definitions (including that for ``exchange'') are``self-explanatory.'' S. Rep. No. 792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. 14. On the otherhand, the many actual references to stock exchanges in the legislativehistory of the Act are to those specific entities that existed at the timeand Congress did not appear to anticipate any type of new, yet unrecognizableform of an exchange. Instead, Congress referred to exchanges ``as thatterm is generally understood.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ There is little background for the definition of theterm ``facility.'' Section 3(a)(2) of the Act states:<ITAG tagnum="28">The term ``facility'' when used with respect to an exchange includesits premises, tangible or intangible property whether on the premises ornot, any right to the use of such premises or property or any service thereoffor the purpose of effecting or reporting a transaction on an exchange(including, among other things, any system of communication to or fromthe exchange, by ticker or otherwise, maintained by or with the consentof the exchange), and any right of the exchange to the use of any propertyor services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The definition of the term has not changed since it was originallyadopted and is very similar to the originally-proposed version.

Purchasesand sales are certainly made there and by the use of its facilities. Ina broad sense it is itself a board or market place. Yet we feel certainthat the Congress cannot intend the absurd result that every little over-the-counterdealer's place of business is itself to be an ``exchange'' for all purposesof the act.</ITAG>Brokers' brokers for government and municipal securities traditionallyhave brought buyers and sellers together by disseminating, through videodisplay systems installed in dealers' offices, the prices and sizes oforders at which primary dealers are willing to trade and the prices andorder sizes of the most recently completed transactions. A primary dealer,having decided to effect a trade at a particular price and order size,instructs the blind broker to execute the trade with the contra party.Trades are executed by the blind broker on an anonymous basis_<T3>i.e., </T3>without the disclosure to either dealer of the identityof the contra party at the time of the trade. Although such systems aredesigned to facilitate the execution of orders, Congress gave no indicationin enacting the Government Securities Act of 1986 \3\\0\<NOTE/> that it intended to subject brokers' brokers to exchangeregistration requirements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\ Pub L. No. 99-571 (September 3, 1986).The Commission believes that the proprietary systems that have developedto-date are distinguishable in function from exchange markets. These proprietarysystems offer to participants the capacity to execute automatically transactionsbased on derivative pricing and also offer the opportunity to advertisepurchasing and selling interest. These systems have not, however, evolvedinto interdealer quotation or transaction mechanisms in which participantsenter two-sided quotations on a regular or continuous basis, thus ensuringa liquid marketplace.The Commission also notes that an overly expansive interpretation of exchangeregistration would impose substantial burdens on existing proprietary tradingsystems. Specifically, application of the statutory fair representationstandard set forth in section 6(b)(3) of the Act to proprietary systemscould act as a barrier to entry for those systems.Moreover, exchange registration would raise substantial questions regardingthe ability of institutions to participate in existing proprietary systems.\3\\1\<NOTE/> In light of the functional differences between existing proprietarysystems and exchange marketplaces and the potential burdens on competitionwhich might arise, the Commission believes at this time that the existingproprietary systems are not required to register as exchanges.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\ An argument can be made that section 6(f)(1) of theAct permits such institutional participation in existing proprietary tradingsystems. It is not clear, however, whether interpreting section 6(f)(1)as permitting institutional participation comports with Congress' intent,set forth in section 3(a)(3)(A) of the Act, to limit membership in an exchangeto registered broker-dealers. In any event, it is clear that the Commission,under section 6(f)(1), could not compel compliance with the systems' regulationsby non-registered institutions that execute transactions solely throughbrokerage services offered by those systems.The Commission believes that subjecting proprietary trading systems toexchange registration pursuant to Section 6 would substantially deter developmentof innovative trading systems.\3\\2\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that it is desirable for certaintrading and quotation systems to be operated as proprietary businesses,rather than as self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'')\3\\3\<NOTE/> so long as each system is subject to an appropriate levelof Commission oversight.\3\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\2\ Moreover, several of the systems that will be subjectto the Rule, <T3>e.g., </T3>the RMJ, Instinet, and POSIT systems, are designed to servelarge institutional investors rather than small retail customers. Becausethese large institutions have far greater capacity to assess and avoidtrading risk than do small retail investors, the Commission is satisfiedthat the purpose of the Act in applying the incremental protections affordedby exchange registration would not be served by their application to thesesystems.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\3\ The Commission emphasizes that this view is based onthe present configuration and trading volumes of those systems.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\4\ The Commission notes that SRO registration might provideregistered entities certain advantages over nonregistered trading systems.For example, only SROs are participants in the Intermarket Trading Systemand the Consolidated Tape Association (``CTA''). While Instinet has a contractallowing it to report trades through CTA, it has no share in revenues orvotes on CTA matters. The options SROs are able to use registration anddisclosure materials tailored specifically for standardized options, whilenon-registered entities must utilize conventional registration forms. Moreover,the antitrust protection accorded exchanges also may be considered a benefitof registration, although this immunity brings with it, and indeed is premisedupon, Commission regulation and oversight. Of course, any entity that feltits operation was unduly hampered for these reasons could avail itselfof those advantages by seeking exchange registration rather than operatingas a proprietary system.The Commission believes, however, that some form of oversight of theseproprietary trading systems is necessary. In particular, the Commissionis concerned with surveillance of these systems as trading volume has increased,\35\<NOTE/> and as the systems have become more sophisticated and havebegun to operate on an international basis.\36\<NOTE/> It is appropriate for the Commission to ascertain that foreignentities participating in the systems are financially responsible and thatsurveillance information can be obtained regarding trading in such systems.\37\<NOTE/> Regulation could also ensure that these systems have sufficientcapacity so that they do not cease to function in periods of unusual volume.Further, given the potential for expansion of these proprietary tradingsystems, it may be important that the Commission have an opportunity toreview and approve or disapprove the rules that govern the operation ofthese systems. Finally, particularly as proprietary trading systems growin size and importance, the question of access to those systems on termsthat are fair and non-discriminatory becomes increasingly significant.\38\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ For example, in 1987, the average monthly trading volumein Instinet (aggregated for all its systems) was approximately 120 millionshares. The average monthly trading volume in Troster Singer's Inside systemswas approximately 184 million shares.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ In this connection, the Commission has required, as aprerequisite to international linkages established by the SROs, comprehensivesurveillance information sharing agreements or undertakings. Although theproprietary systems have not as yet established linkages with foreign markets,such linkages could occur in the near future, and the Commission has noarrangements for their oversight. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ Domestically, activity occurring through these tradingsystems does not go unscrutinized. The NASD examines a member's activitiesin various trading systems just as it does any member's other OTC tradingactivities. The exchanges also conduct surveillance of their specialists'trading activity occurring through Instinet.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ Although the activities of most of these systems wouldconstitute broker or dealer activities under sections 3(a)(4) and 3(a)(5)of the Act and would require registration as a broker-dealer under section15(b) of the Act, as a municipal securities broker or a government securitiesdealer under section 15C, and thus would trigger the incremental protectionsafforded by those provisions, proposed Rule 15c2-10 could ensure that systemscapacity is adequate, and that access is not unfairly denied. Registrationas a broker-dealer subjects the registrant to requirements to maintainadequate net capital (Rule 15c3-1 under the Act) and to provide for theprotection of customers' securities and funds (Rule 15c3-3 under the Act).Broker-dealer registration, however, may limit the Commission's oversightof the actual organizational nature of the systems, including regulationof such burdens on competition as entry criteria for order-entry firmsand market makers. The broker-dealer regulatory framework also would notapply to essential areas such as terms of execution, the routing of indicationsof interest and the handling of system errors or failures.Proprietary trading systems increasingly are assuming new functions (suchas Instinet's and POSIT's crossing features) and providing new tradingand quotation mechanisms. The systems also are expanding to include a growinguniverse of securities, such as the options to be traded on the RMJ systemand the foreign securities traded on Instinet. In light of these developments,the Commission believes that it is important for sponsors of these systemsto accept clear responsibility for enforcing compliance by their participantswith the securities laws.The regulatory conditions imposed in the no-action approach rely on theepisodic reporting of trading and product innovations and limit the availabilityto the Commission of the information it needs to monitor these systems.In its no-action letters, the Division informed operators of automatedsystems that it would not recommend Commission enforcement action if theydid not register their systems as exchanges.\3\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\9\ The Division also advised the operators of severalsystems that the Division's no-action position applies to nonregistrationof their systems as clearing agencies. <T3>See</T3> Instinet, NAPEX, and Adler no-action letters, <T3>supra</T3> note 3. Moreover, the staff extended a no-action positionto Instinet regarding its nonregistration as a national securities association.Instinet no-action letter, <T3>supra</T3> note 3.The no-action posture was conditioned on the Division's being promptlyinformed of any material operational changes. In addition, so that theCommission could be kept advised of changing market conditions, the systemoperators also were required to provide certain quarterly data.\4\\0\<NOTE/> The purpose of this data was to permit the staff to monitoractivity in the trading and information systems, as well as the rules thesesystems developed regarding executions in the systems and quotation dissemination;however, the staff does not believe it has enough regular information todo so effectively.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\0\ As a general matter, the staff requested that eachapplicant provide on a quarterly basis data on: (1) The number and identityof subscribers in the system; (2) the applicants or subscribers who havebeen denied participation or have withdrawn, and the reasons why; (3) thenumber of money defaults or failures to deliver; (4) the system's response,if any; (5) the cost to the company of satisfying such defaults; and (6)the estimated cost to subscribers of any defaults not satisfied by thesystem. The Division also requested trading volume data and informationconcerning the kinds of securities (<T3>e.g., </T3>common stock) traded through the system and current copiesof any rules, regulations or similar documents and any contracts that participantsare required to sign. Finally, the system operator was to provide the staffwith thirty days' notice of any contemplated material changes in the operationof its system.Finally, the Commission believes that, given the potentially significantimpact of these systems on the OTC trading of securities, it is appropriatefor public investors to have notice and an opportunity to comment on thetrading systems themselves and on significant changes to those systemsproposed by the sponsors of the systems. Such opportunity for comment,which is not available under the no-action approach but which would beprovided under the proposed Rule,\41\<NOTE/> will assist the Commission in ensuring that the systems operatein a manner consistent with the purposes of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\1\ <T3>See</T3> sections c(2)(i) and d (3) and (4) of the proposed Rule, <T3>infra</T3> at 52-53, 55-56.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Description of the Proposed Rule</ITAG>For the reasons discussed above, the Commission is proposing Rule 15c2-10(``Rule'') to require identification of trading and information facilities.The Rule is inteded to permit proprietary trading systems to operate effectivelywhile at the same time subjecting those systems to Commission scrutinyin order to assess whether the systems operate in a manner consistent withthe fundamental purposes of the Act_the protection of investors and themaintenance of fair and orderly markets.The proposed Rule would require each operator of a trading and informationsystem \4\\2\<NOTE/> to submit to the Commission a plan covering the system. TheCommission would publish and review the plan, and, if the Commission determinedthat it met the requirements of the Rule, it would declare the plan effective.Under the Commission's proposal, a broker or dealer or municipal securitiesdealer or government securities dealer would be prohibited form sponsoringor entering an indication of interest, quotation, or order to purchaseor sell a security in the trading system unless the plan had been declaredeffective.\4\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\2\ The rule would define specifically the term ``tradingsystem.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\3\ Should the Commission adopt the Rule, the Divisionwould continue to provide no-action relief with respect to registrationas an exchange for proprietary trading systems in appropriate circumstances,and prior no-action positions would not be withdrawn. The Rule would, ofcourse, apply to operators of all trading systems that receive or havereceived no-action treatment form the staff.A. Systems Covered by the RuleThe Rule would encompass any system that provides for the disseminationoutside the sponsor \4\\4\<NOTE/> and its affiliates of indications of interest, quotations,or orders to purchase of sell securities and that provides procedures forexecuting or settling transactions in such securities.\4\\5\<NOTE/> The proposed Rule, however, excludes the following threetypes of trading and information facilities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\4\ The Rule specifically would define a ``sponsor'' asa person who organizes, operates, administers or otherwise controls, directlyor indirectly, a trading system.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\5\ Thus, a system that only disseminates information anddoes not provide any execution or settlement procedures would not be subjectto the Rule. Procedures for executing or settling transactions would includeany rules, guidelines or facilities for either order entry and executionor the clearing and settling of trades.First, the Rule would not apply to a system in which the sponsor is a brokeror dealer that limits use of the system to its own retail customers. TheCommission believes that a system in which all transactions are executedby the broker or dealer for itself or its customers does no more than automatethe internal execution functions traditionally engaged in by an integratedbroker-dealer.\4\\6\<NOTE/> For example, many firms operate proprietary automatic executionsystems for NASDAQ securities. These internal systems route orders fromthe branch office of a retail firm to the firm's traders. The system thenexecutes the order automatically at the NASDAQ inside quotation (<T3>i.e., </T3>the highest bid price or the lowest asked price) and reportsthe execution to the trader, the branch office, back office clearing, andfor National Market System (``NMS'') securities, to the NASD.\4\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\6\ The Commission requests comment on the appropriatebreadth of this exemption; specifically, whether the exemption should berewritten to apply to systems that automate the internal order routingand execution capacities of the sponsoring broker-dealer, and that providetheir customers with access to those services.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\7\ In the case of a proprietary trading system that linksthe facilities of an introducing broker-dealer to those of a clearing broker-dealer,and that permits orders entered by customers of the introducing firm tobe executed through the system and cleared through the facilities of theclearing firm, both the introducing firm and the clearing firm would bedeemed one broker-dealer for purposes of this exemption. Accordingly, theproprietary trading system linking the two firms would fall within theexception to the Rule.Second, the Rule also would not apply to certain systems currently operatingsolely as brokers' brokers \4\\8\<NOTE/> for non-equity securities. A brokers' broker trading systemwould be defined as any system that, with respect to non-equity securitiesincluding, but not limited to, government and municipal securities, onlycollects and disseminates without any identification of the responsiblefirm, quotations or indications of interest to brokers and dealers andprovides: (1) The means for executing transactions based on such indicationsof interest or quotations, or (2) the means for executing, as principal,the contemporaneous purchase and offsetting sale or sale and offsettingpurchase from or to other brokers, dealers, and municipal and governmentsecurities dealers.\4\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\8\ A brokers' broker, which operates chiefly in the governmentand municipal securities markets, collects and disseminates buy and sellinterests from and to its customers by receiving indications of interestfrom dealers and communicating them by telephone or rebroadcasting suchinterest over its proprietary system. In effect, a system operated by abrokers' broker permits dealers to advertise anonymously their tradinginterests.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\9\ A system, such as the system proposed to be operatedby RMJ Securities, that provides clearing and settling as well as blindbrokerage services to participants, would not fall within this exclusion.Similarly, systems such as the RMJ system, which permits participants tosubmit quotations and trade directly with one another on a fully disclosedbasis, and the POSIT system, in which customers may specify how much informationabout their orders may be revealed to other participants in POSIT, wouldfall outside this exclusion.Finally, the Rule would not cover a trading and information facility operatedby a registered national securities exchange or association, such as theNew York Stock Exchange's ``Designated Order Turnaround'' system or theNASD's Small Order Execution System. Such a facility already is regulatedthrough the Commission's review of the rules of each registered nationalsecurities exchange or association.\5\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\0\ Self-regulatory organizations are generally requiredto file with the Commission, pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under the Act, changesto ``any material aspect of the facilities'' of the self-regulatory organizations.B.Contents of the Plan and Initial SubmissionThe Rule would require system sponsors to submit as part of the plan thefollowing information regarding the system:(1) The name and address of the plan sponsor and a description of the sponsor'sorganization, including any subsidiary or other affiliate involved withthe operation of the system.(2) The securities, or types of securities,\5\\1\<NOTE/> that may be traded on or through the system.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\1\ For example, a system operator could specify in itsfiling that the system is available for trading in such categories as listedstocks, or NASDAQ stocks, or both. The operator would not need to nameeach security and would be required to amend the filing only if a new typeof security were included in the system.(3) A description of the method of the operation of the system, includingthe procedures governing the execution and, if applicable, clearance andsettlement of transactions and the entry of indications of interest, quotationsand orders. The operator should include in this description the types oftransactions that can be executed and the specific parameters for eachtype of transaction.(4) The terms and conditions under which persons will be granted or deniedaccess to the system as participants or subscribers. The sponsor shouldinclude the specific procedures and standards to govern such grant or denialof access.\5\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\2\ Denial of access here would encompass a refusal bythe sponsor to enter into the contractual relationship with a person necessaryto allow that person to use the system. Such denials of access would bereviewable by the Commission under paragraph (e) of the proposed Rule,which incorporates the procedural provisions set forth in Rule 11Aa3-2under the Act.(5) A description of the system's requirements regarding the financialsoundness and integrity of participants and subscribers.(6) A description of the staffing, systems, and procedures in place tosupervise the system for compliance by participants and subscribers withthe terms and conditions of the plan and the federal securities laws andrules and regulations thereunder.(7) A description of procedures that will be followed in the event of anoperational failure.(8) An agreement to keep, preserve, and make available to the Commissionon request, all records made or received by it in the course of its business,including financial statements and data regarding indications of interest,quotations, orders, and trades in the system. The plan shall provide thatthe system operator shall keep all such documents for at least five years,the first two years in an easily accessible place.(9) An agreement to submit to the Commission annually, and to furnish promptlyat any time upon request, data regarding indications of interests, quotations,orders, and trades in the system, and copies of the above-enumerated records.(10) An agreement to report to the Commission any information receivedby the sponsor providing the sponsor reasonable grounds to suspect thata participant or subscriber may have violated the federal securities laws.(11) An agreement to supervise the system to ensure compliance with theplan and the federal securities laws.\53\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ Where, as in the case of five of the six systems currentlyin operation, the sponsor of the system plan is a registered broker-dealer,that sponsor is subject to the oversight of the appropriate self-regulatoryorganization, as defined under section 3(a)(26) of the Act. The existenceof Commission supervision pursuant to the proposed Rule in no way replacesthe oversight responsibilities of those self-regulatory organizations.(12) An agreement to notify the Commission in writing immediately shouldthe system cease its operations.(13) If any entity would hold or safeguard subscriber funds on a regularbasis, a description of the procedures and controls that will be implementedto ensure the safety of those funds, and an agreement to submit to theCommission annual audited financial statements as a condition to the effectivenessof the plan.\54\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ Such an entity may be required to register as a broker-dealerand clearing agency under sections 15 and 17A, respectively, of the Act.(14) An agreement to permit examinations, by representatives of the Commission,of the sponsor and of the trading system operated by the sponsor.(15) A description of all other material aspects of the system, its facilities,operations, and financial condition.Should a sponsor fail to comply with any of the provisions or agreementscontained in the plan, the Commission, after appropriate notice and hearing,may rescind the effectiveness of the trading system plan if it finds thatthe sponsor's failure to comply is inconsistent with the public interest,the protection of investors, and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets,or the removal of impediments to, and perfection of the mechanisms of,a national market system for securities and a national system for the clearanceand settlement of securities transactions. In this connection, the Ruleauthorizes the Commission to conduct examinations of the sponsor and ofthe trading system operated by the sponsor, including an examination ofall books and records maintained pursuant to the Rule.Under the Rule, with respect to approval of a trading system plan, theCommission would use the procedures provided in paragraphs (c) (1) and(2) of Rule 11Aa3-2 under the Act,\55\<NOTE/> which generally apply to national market system plans. Theseprocedures require the Commission to publish notice of the filing of atrading system plan and the terms of the substance of the plan and provideinterested persons an opportunity to submit written comments. Within 120days of the publication of notice of the filing of the plan, or within180 days of such date should the Commission find a longer period to beappropriate and publish its reasons for so finding, the Commission wouldapprove the plan if it determined that: (1) The sponsor and system areorganized and have the capacity to comply and to enforce compliance byparticipants and subscribers with the terms and conditions of the plan;\56\<NOTE/> (2) the plan is necessary or appropriate in the public interest,for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderlymarkets and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a nationalmarket system for securities and a national system for the clearance andsettlement of securities transactions; (3) the plan does not impose a burdenon competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act andrules thereunder. Under the Rule, the Commission also could impose suchterms and conditions as it deemed necessary and appropriate, in accordancewith the above approval standards.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ 17 CFR 240.11Aa3-2 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ This generally will require a showing of the capacityto monitor trading and quotation dissemination in the system, and to ensureat a minimum compliance with the requirements of the sponsor's contract.In addition, this may require information-sharing agreements with U.S.SROs as well as any foreign SROs or governments where the system may beoperating. Furthermore, the Commission would have the authority pursuantto the proposed Rule to inspect any system to ensure its continuing abilityto ensure compliance with this requirement.C. Plan Amendments Requirements analogous to those of section 19 of the Act and Rule 19b-4thereunder would apply to plan amendments. A system sponsor would submitto the Commission any amendment to an effective plan, accompanied by aconcise general statement of the basis and purpose of a plan amendment.\5\\7\<NOTE/> The amendment would ordinarily take effect thirty days afterfiling with the Commission,\5\\8\<NOTE/> unless the Commission approves the plan amendment beforethe expiration of the thirty-day period upon a good cause finding.\5\\9\<NOTE/> Moreover, a plan amendment may take effect immediately uponfiling with the Commission if the amendment meets the standard for immediateeffectiveness of proposed rule changes filed by SROs as set forth in section19(b)(3)(A) of the Act.\6\\0\<NOTE/> Within thirty days of the submission, the Commission by ordermay defer the effectiveness of any amendment (whether pending or effectiveon filing) upon a Commission finding of good cause, if the Commission determinesthat such deferral of effectiveness is necessary or appropriate in thepublic interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtheranceof the purposes of the Act. If the Commission defers effectiveness, itmust publish notice of the plan amendment. In addition, if the Commissiondetermines not to defer effectiveness, but determines that public commenton a plan amendment would be appropriate, the Commission may publish noticeof the plan amendment. Within thirty days of the publication of noticeof the filing of the plan amendment (and notice where applicable, of adetermination to defer effectiveness of the rule filing), or a longer periodas to which the system sponsor consented or as the Commission designatedup to 120 days if it found such longer period to be appropriate and publishedits reasons for so finding, the Commission would by order; (1) Approvethe plan amendment if it appears to the Commission that the plan amendmentis consistent with the requiremets of the Act and the rules applicableto the trading system plan or (2) permanently disapprove (or abrogate inthe case of an amendment that was either effective on filing or had takeneffect prior to thirty days after filing) the plan amendment if it appearsto the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the publicinterest, for the protection of investors, or othwrwise in furtheranceof the purposes of the Act. Unless the Commmission orders otherwise, Commissionaction abrogating an amendment would not affect the validity or force ofthe amendment during the period it was in effect. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\7\ Unlike procedures under section 19(b)(1), the Commissionwould, upon the filing of the plan amendment, ``publish notice thereoftogether with the terms of substance of the [plan amendment] or a descriptionof the subjects and issues involved,'' and provide interested persons anopportunity to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning such[plan amendment]'' only where it finds that public comment is necessaryor appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\8\ The proposal that an amendment take effect thirty daysafter filing varies from the standard procedures of section 19 of the Act,but the Commission believes that such variance would be desirable to accomodatethe needs of proprietary trading systems to remain flexible in developingadditional capabilities. Should certain trading systems in the future growto a size and importance equivalent to existing trading markets, the Commissionwould review the appropriateness of this provision. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\9\ The ``good cause'' standard for accelerated effectivenessis based on section 19(b)(2)(B) of the Act, which governs the acceleratedeffectivenes of proposed rule changes by SROs. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\0\ Under section 19(b)(3)(A), a proposed rule change iseffective upon filing with the Commission if it is designated by the SROas: (1) constituting a stated policy, practice, or interpretation withrespect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an existing ruleof the SRO; (2) establishing or changing a fee or other charge imposedby the SRO; or (3) concerning solely the administration of the SRO. Finally, the Commission itself also could promulgate by rule an amendmentto an effective trading system plan should it determine that the amendmentwere necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protectionof investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and to removeimpediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a national market system forsecurities and national system for the clearance and settlement of securitiestransactions.\61\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ <T3>See </T3>Section 19(c) of the Act, which provides that the Commissionmay abrogate, add to, or delete from the rules of SROs upon notice to theappropriate SRO, publication of the proposed change to the SROs rules,and the provision of an opportunity for oral presentation of views regardingthe proposed change.D. Appeals The Commission would have the discretion, pursuant to section (e) of theRule, to entertain appeals concerning the implementation or operation ofan effective plan, including appeals concerning prohibitions or limitations,in the same manner and subject to the same standards as described in Rule11Aa3-2(e) under the Act. E. Exemptions The Commission would be able to exempt from the requirements of the Ruleany person, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions,if the Commission determines that the exemption is consistent with thepublic interest, the protection of investors, the maintenance of fair andorderly markets and the removal of impediments to and perfection of themechanisms of a national market system for securities and a national systemfor the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. F. Rescission After appropriate notice and hearing, pursuant to subsection (g) of theproposed rule, the Commission could rescind the effectiveness of a tradingsystem plan if it determined that: (1) the sponsor of a plan, without reasonablejustification or excuse, had failed to comply or to enforce complianceby participants, subscribers, or customers with the terms, conditions,and agreements of its effective trading system plan; and (2) Such failure was inconsistent with the public interest, the protectionof investors, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, and the removalof impediments to and perfection of the mechanisms of a national marketsystem for securities and a national system for the clearance and settlementof securities transactions. G. Rule 3a12-7 The Commission also proposes amendments to Rule 3a12-7 under the Act \62\<NOTE/> to state that put and call options on U.S. government securitieswould not be exempt from the provisions of sections 15(c)(2), 11A, and17A of the Act and the rules thereunder. Therefore the words ``except forsections 15(c)(2), 11A, and 17A'' would be added after ``shall be exemptfrom all provisions of the Act.'' The intended effect of this amendmentwould be to require that government securities options systems, such asthe system planned by RMJ, comply with the proposed rule if it is adopted,and to clarify that entities that meet the definition of ``clearing agency''set forth in the Act and that clear transactions in options on governmentsecurities executed through proprietary trading systems, may be subjectto the clearing agency registration requirements of section 17A of theAct. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\ Rule 3a12-7 states: <ITAG tagnum="28">Any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege traded exclusively otherwisethan on a national securities exchange and for which quotations are notdisseminated through an automated quotation system of a registered securitiesassociation, which relates to any securities which are direct obligationsof, or obligations guaranteed as to principal or interest by, the UnitedStates or securities issued or guaranteed by a corporation in which theUnited States has a direct or indirect interest as shall be designatedfor exemption by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to section 3(a)(12)of the Act, shall be exempt from all provisions of the Act which by theirterms do not apply to any ``exempt security'' or ``exempt securities,''provided that the securities underlying such put, call, straddle, optionor privilege represent an obligation equal to or exceeding $250,000 principalamount. </ITAG>H. Statutory Authority The Rule would be promulgated under sections 2, 3, 11A, 15(c), 17, 17Aand 23(a) of the Act. The Rule is designed to prohibit and prevent fraudulentand deceptive practices, including fictitious quotations, that could occurin the systems subject to the rule absent Commission oversight.\63\<NOTE/> In addition, the Rule is designed to create greater equalityof regulatory treatment as between exchange systems and proprietary tradingsystems.\64\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\63\ <T3>See</T3> sections 15(c)(1) and (2).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\64\ <T3>See </T3>section 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii), in which Congress stated, ``It isin the public interest and appropriate for the protection of investorsand the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to assure . . . fair competitionamong brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchangemarkets and markets other than exchange markets.'' <T3>See also </T3>section 11A(c)(1)(F), in which Congress directed theCommission to prescribe such rules and regulations to ``assure equal regulationof all markets for qualified securities and all exchange members, brokers,and dealers effecting transactions in such securities.'' VI. Request forComments The Commission requests comment on the costs and benefits of the proposedrule, as well as the consistency of the rule's approach with the policiesunderlying the Act. In that regard, commentators are invited to addressthe issue whether proprietary trading systems might be more appropriatelyregulated by imposing on system sponsors, pursuant to the Commission'srulemaking authority over broker-dealers, enhanced recordkeeping and reportingrequirements and ensuring Commission access to records.\65\<NOTE/> Such an approach could require that system sponsors adhereto financial responsibility criteria applicable to registered broker-dealersgenerally, or could add criteria relating specifically to broker-dealersmaintaing a proprietary trading system. The rules also could require thatsponsors conduct surveillance of trading in the system and otherwise supervisesystem participants. Comment is specifically invited on (1) whether thisapproach would be more appropriate in light of the policies of the Actthan would a regulatory scheme comparable to statutory oversight of self-regulatoryorganizations, including Commission plan approval and rule supplementationpowers; and (2) whether this approach would reduce regulatory burdens onthe systems and increase market efficiency. Commentators also are invitedto address the appropriateness of adopting a ``standards'' approach, inwhich the proposed Rule would set forth standards under which plans andplan amendments will be approved, rather than delineate general categoriesof information those plans and plan amendments should contain.\66\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\ As noted <T3>supra </T3>n. 13, each of the trading systems currently in operationis sponsored by either: (1) a broker-dealer registered pursuant to section15(b) of the Act (a ``registered broker-dealer'') or section 15C of theAct (a ``government securities broker-dealer''); (2) an entity affiliatedwith a registered broker-dealer; or (3) an entity in the process of registeringas a broker-dealer under section 15(b). Thus, all current sponsors (ortheir affiliates) will be subject to the requirements, encompassed in Rules17a-3, 17a-4, and 17a-5 under the Act (or, with respect to government securitiesbroker-dealers, andSection;andSection;404.2, 404.3 and 405.2 of the TreasuryRegulations, 17 CFR Ch. IV), to keep and preserve records reflecting dataon transactions effected and accounts held by the broker-dealer, and tosubmit monthly and quarterly reports to the Commission. ``Enhanced'' recordkeepingrequirements could include a requirement, similar to the one found in theRule as currently proposed, that system sponsors make available to theCommission, on request, every document made or received by the sponsorin the course of its operation of the system [<T3>see </T3>Proposed Rule, section c(viii)]. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\ The Commission could perhaps use, as a model for sucha standards-based approach, Release No. 16900, published in 1980 to assistclearing agencies in modifying their rules to comply with the specificrequirements of the Act. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16900 (June17, 1980), 45 FR 41920 (``Standards Released''). For example, the StandardsRelease provides that, in order to ensure that clearing agencies adequatelysafeguard securities and funds and provide prompt and accurate clearanceand settlement of securities transactions pursuant to Section 17A(b)(3)(A)of the Act, those clearing agencies should, <T3>inter alia, </T3>perform periodic risk assessments, establish auditedcommittees of their boards of directors, set up internal audit departments,and furnish audit financial statements annually to participants. <T3>See also, </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20221 (September23, 1983), 48 FR 5167.Finally, the Commission requests comment on whether it should set forthstandards for exempting, pursuant to Section 5 of the Act, certain tradingsystems from the requirements of exchange registration. In that regard,the Commission recognizes that, over time, there may evolve trading systemsthat, because of the display of regular or continuous two-sided quotationsor because they exhibit other traditional characteristics of an exchange,may fall within the definition of the term ``exchange'' under the Act.Nevertheless, the application of each requirement set forth in section6 of the Act to these systems arguably may continue to be inappropriate.Accordingly, the Commission requests comment on whether it should articulatestandards for the granting of exemptions from exchange registration requirements.Section 5 of the Act requires that all United States exchanges either registerwith the Commission as national securities exchanges or obtain a Commissionexemption from that registration. An exemption may be granted if the Commissiondetermines that, ``by reason of the limited volume of transactions effectedon such exchange, it is not practicable and not necessary or appropriatein the public interest or for the protection of investors'' to requiresuch registration. The legislative history of the Act does not discussthe factors the Commission should consider in determining whether registrationis not practicable and not necessary or appropriate by reason of ``limitedvolume.''\6\\7\<NOTE/> Further, in the seven instances in which the Commission hasgranted section 5 exemptions to stock exchanges on other than a temporarybasis, the Commission's exemptive orders have not delineated the factorsconsidered in reaching the determination that the ``limited volume'' criterionhas been satisfied. Rather, tracking the language of section 5, those ordersrecite the Commission's conclusion that registration was ``not practicableand not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protectionof investors'' in light of the limited volume of transactions effectedon the exempted exchanges.\6\\8\<NOTE/> [Prior to enactment of the Act, five of the exchanges thatreceived exemptions in 1935 and 1936 submitted the following informationto the Senate:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\7\ S. Rep. No. 792, to accompany S. 3420, at 6 (April17, 1934) (``[t]he Commission * * * is empowered to exempt from registrationsmall exchanges where the volume of transactions is not sufficient to invitethe abuses prevalent on the large markets'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\8\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 416, November 14, 1935(exempting the Honolulu and Minneapolis-St. Paul Stock Exchanges and theMilwaukee Grain and Stock Exchange); 432, December 2, 1935 (exempting theRichmond and Wheeling Stock Exchanges); 472, February 3, 1936 (exemptingthe Colorado Springs Stock Exchange); and 589, April 10, 1976 (exemptingthe Seattle Stock Exchange).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s30,10,r30</C> <H1>Exchanges</H1><H1>Volume in Shares (1932)</H1><H1>Market Value of Shares Listed (1933)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Colorado Springs Stock Exchange <D>52,519 </D><D>$5.6 million.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Milwaukee Grain andamp; Stock Exchange <D>143,305 </D><D>$113.6 million.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Minneapolis-St. Paul Stock Exchange <D>323,062 </D><D>$84 million.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Richmond Stock Exchange <D>14,014 </D><D>not available.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Seattle Stock Exchange <D>15,393 </D><D>$29.3 million.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">New York Stock Exchange <D>425,234,294 </D><D>$22.2 billion</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(Figures extracted from <T3>Hearings on Stock Exchange Practices Before the Subcommittee on Bankingand Currency, Senate Banking Committee</T3> 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 17at 7852-56 (1934))</ITAG>Specifically, the Commission requests comment on whether it should interpretthe term ``limited volume'' in Section 5 of the Act to take into accountall, or a combination of, the following characteristics, among others thatmight be suggested by the commentators:(1) The dollar volume and/or number of transactions done through the system,expressed as a percentage of all trading done in the market of which thatparticular system is a part;(2) The number and characteristics of participants or subscribers permittedto trade in the system; and(3) The characteristics of the instruments traded, or transactions allowed,in the system.Of course, the Commission could, as it has in the past, impose conditionson such exemptions if they are granted. For example, in prior exemptiveorders the Commission has imposed on exempted exchanges recordkeeping andreporting requirements, and requirements to comply and to enforce compliancewith the Act.\6\\9\<NOTE/> Similarly, future exemptions could be conditioned on theexempted exchanges being required to file plans and plan amendments withthe Commission, and to submit to: (1) Commission review of action takenby the exchanges denying access to the system to current or prospectivemembers, and (2) Commission jurisdiction to amend the rules of the exchangeif the public interest so requires. In view of the range of alternativesopen to the Commission, the Commission solicits comment on the proper regulationof exchanges exempted pursuant to section 5 of the Act. As a related matter,the Commission requests suggestions and comments on any other possiblemethod of regulation or oversight of the trading and information systems.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\69\<T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 416, November 14,1935, at 1-2 (exempting the Honolulu and Minneapolis-St. Paul Stock Exchangesand the Milwaukee Grain and Stock Exchange).<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Summary of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis(``IRFA'') pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act\70\<NOTE/> regarding proposed Rule 15c2-10. The IRFA states that althougha minimal number of broker-dealers operating trading systems would be coveredby the Rule (and an even smaller number would be deemed small entities),the Commission determined to prepare the IRFA because the exact numberof small entities that could be affected by the Rule is unknown. The IRFAstates that the proposed Rule would ensure that proprietary trading systemsoperate effectively and in a manner consistent with the fundamental purposesof the Act. The IRFA also sets forth the concerns with the current regulatoryapproach, and discusses possible alternatives to the proposed Rule forthe regulation of small entities.
