Battles between South African-led security forces and guerrillasof the South-West Africa People's Organization raged again today,military officials said. They said South African warplanes havebeen used for the first time.   South Africa, Angola and Cuba planned emergency talks Saturdayaimed at preserving the U.N.-sponsored plan for Namibia'sindependence. U.S. and Soviet obeserves were expected to attend themeeting.   Anton Lubowski, one of SWAPO's few white members, told a newconference that the head of the U.N. operation in Namibia,Finland's Martti Ahtisaari, should be replaced immediately.   ``They (U.N. officials) are coming with exactly the samearguments as South Africa that the guerrillas must be disarmed,''Lubowski said. ``What kind of objectivity is that?   ``It is clear they are working with the South Africans and arein the South Africans' pocket,'' said Lubowski, a Windhoek attorney.   Lubowski belongs to SWAPO's legal political wing and is a memberof the organization's secretariat, its administrative arm. SWAPO'stop leaders and the outlawed guerrilla operation are based abroad.   At least 259 SWAPO guerrillas and 25 security force members havebeen killed since gun battles broke out Saturday, when a cease-firewas supposed to have taken effect, police officials said. They said78 security force members and an undetermined number of SWAPOfighters have been injured.   South African Col. Japie Dreyer, briefing journalists at amilitary base in the northern town of Oshakati, said four SouthAfrican Impala jet fighters were called into action Thursday forthe first time this week. The jets fired on SWAPO positions,killing 17 people, he said. Dreyer said the guerrillas lacked radioequipment and there was little chance they could be instructed toretreat or surrender, as South Africa has demanded.   South Africa claims SWAPO has sent more than 1,500 guerrillasinto northern Namibia in violation of an accord requiring theinsurgents to remain at bases at least 100 miles away in Angola.   SWAPO leaders contend the guerrillas have been in Namibia forsome time and have no intention of leaving for Angola.   However, Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, whosecountry has hosted the guerrillas for 23 years, criticized SWAPOleaders for the incursion into Namibia.   ``I regret the SWAPO leadership was not able to exercise totalcontrol over its guerrillas at the critical moment of the start of(U.N.) Resolution 435, by stopping anyone crossing theAngolan-Namibian frontier,'' dos Santos said Thursday in Luanda.   Some U.N. and other officials have suggested SWAPO fieldcommanders mistakenly thought their units could return unmolestedto Namibia as of April 1 and set up bases. Several capturedguerrillas say they returned to Namibia in search of U.N. personneland didn't expect to fight with security forces.   Members of the six Frontline states, a southern Africa regionalbloc, have offered to send troops to reinforce the U.N. forces, theAngolan state news agency ANGOP reported today. There was no wordfrom the United Nations.   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia for 74 years, hasthreatened to suspend the U.N. independence plan for that countryif the crisis is not resolved. But South Africa's foreign minister,Pik Botha, said Thursday that South Africa remained committed tothe plan.   He said South Africa was receiving an unprecedented degree ofinternational support and was likely to benefit by being sparedfurther economic sanctions. SWAPO's international image had beenweakened, he said.   The South African Council of Churches, led by prominentanti-apartheid clergymen, said Thursday that ``the carnage of thelast few days'' could have been prevented if the United Nations haddenied South Africa's request to let its forces leave their basesto combat the guerrillas. The church council said the credibilityof the U.N. peacekeeping force was now in doubt.   Cedric Thornberry, second-in-command of the U.N. contingent,said the United Nations hoped to have its first infantry battalionsin the northern battle areas by early next week. On Wednesday, theUnited Nations accepted a U.S. offer to airlift a battalion ofabout 850 Finnish soldiers to Namibia.   The United Nations has authorized 4,650 troops for the Namibiaoperation, but only 921 have arrived. The only forces in the northare 300 logistical personnel.</TEXT></DOC>
