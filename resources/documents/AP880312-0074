Young girls were lured away from school by women who told themtheir mothers were ill and offered to take them home, thegovernment-owned Dainik Bangla and other newspapers reported.   A senior police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,said hundreds of women had been smuggled across the border inrecent years.   ``Most of these women land up in brothels, either in India or inPakistan,'' he said.   In some cases, people have paid smugglers who promised them anescape from Bangladesh's grinding poverty, according to newspapers.The smugglers, known as ``manpower agents,'' promise jobs asservants and manual laborers in prosperous Middle Eastern nations.   Often the victims end up as nothing more than slaves inhouseholds or on farms.   Maj. Noor, a battalion commander of the Bangladesh Rifles borderguards, said a new alert was declared Monday at the border betweenBangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal in an effort to stopthe smuggling.   ``We have recovered at least 80 women and children and someaccompanying men since the latest crackdown started on March 7,''Noor said when contacted by telephone at border town of Rajshahi.   He said the group included 28 women, 31 children and 29 men.   Dhaka newspapers said 200 women and children had been rescuedfrom the smugglers and 15 men had been charged with humantrafficking since Jan. 1.   The latest reported interception occurred Friday when six women,16 men and one child were caught in the border towns of Sahebnagarand Bidirpur, the Dainik Bangla and Daily Itefaq newspapers said.Two of the men were arrested on charges of trafficking in humanlives.   By piecing together sketchy reports in Dhaka newspapers the pastthree days, a picture emerges of how the traffickers operate:   Eleven-year-old Najma Akthar was playing with friends at theirschoolyard last week in Munshiganj, just outside Dhaka, when amiddle-aged woman approached her.   The woman said Najma's mother was seriously ill. Puzzled andworried, the sixth-grader left the playground with the woman in arickshaw.   Three days later, she and eight women who also had been luredaway on false pretenses were in Bidirpur, 90 miles northwest ofDhaka. Border police rescued them before they could be taken acrossthe frontier.   Others paid for what they thought would be passports to betterlives.   Bangladesh, with 105 million people, is one of the world's mostdensely populated nations. The per capital annual income is about$150.   ``I sold my jewelry to pay the man who promised me a job inPakistan,'' Dainik Bangla quoted Josna Rani Sarkar as saying.   The 25-year-old woman, whose husband had deserted her, was oneof those found by border guards this week.   Mrs. Sarkar and other women were quoted as saying they paidbetween $100 and $200 for the journey.   A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,said the government was investigating local press reports that atleast 10,000 Bangladeshis had been jailed abroad for using falsepassports and other papers.   The Dainik Bangla, a Bengali-language newspaper, said lastOctober that police suspect some children have been smuggled out ofBangladesh for more macabre purposes.   The newspaper said there were unconfirmed reports that childrenhad been taken across the Indian border to West Bengal and killedso their skeletons could be sold for medical studies.   Bangladeshi officials have declined to comment on this report.   Similar reports of Indian children being killed in 1984 surfacedin the Indian state of Bihar. Headless bodies were found in ariver, and a box of children's skulls was later discovered at arailway station in Patna, Bihar's capital.</TEXT></DOC>
