While other companies have also been setting up phonesthat offer facsimile services, ATandamp;T's new pay phones willoffer a full-color computer screen and even devices to aidthe handicapped. Mounted on walls or kiosks like ATandamp;T'scurrent charge-card phones, they will represent the mostsweeping change in ATandamp;T pay phones since the introduction ofcoin-operated booth models in 1908.</LP><TEXT>   ATandamp;T said its current pay phones are installed in 85 ofthe country's 100 biggest airports, nine of the 10 largesthotel chains and most major convention centers. By the end ofnext year all of these phones will be replaced by the newphone, which ATandamp;T calls the Public Phone 2000, according toDennis Corrigan, ATandamp;T's national public phone manager. Hewouldn't divulge the exact number of card phones the companyoperates or how much it plans to spend on the upgrade.   ATandamp;T's plan is certain to raise the stakes in the highlycompetitive $13 billion calling-card arena. ATandamp;T has beenbattling its rivals, MCI Communications Corp. and US SprintCommunications Co., a unit of United Telecommunications Inc.,to keep its customers by adding services. Neither MCI norSprint offers long-distance charging services via phones likethe Public Phone 2000. And neither of these carriers has thethousands of special public card phones that ATandamp;T operates,notes Jerry Lucas, president of TeleStrategies Inc., aMcLean, Va., telecommunications consulting firm.   &quot;The business traveler is what the carriers are goingfor,&quot; says Mr. Lucas. &quot;They want to put their card in yourwallet. And eventually it will be a smart card, giving youaccess to numerous information services. ATandamp;T has alwaysenvisioned moving into the enhanced services arena beyondlong-distance.&quot;   ATandamp;T's new Public Phone 2000 is equipped with a datascreen for reading and editing text and outlets that willaccept laptop computers and portable fax machines. Inaddition, Mr. Corrigan said 30% of the new phones it installswill have a personal-computer-style keyboard attached,allowing callers to enter text and send it to a distantcomputer through the phone line. Most of the phones withkeyboards will be installed in sit-down booths, he said.   Such a high-tech phone would seem to be a magnet forvandals, but Mr. Corrigan said ATandamp;T isn't too concernedbecause the phones &quot;will be in lobbies where there are plentyof security people,&quot; and the keyboard is housed in heavymetal and secured by large bolts that are accessible onlyfrom inside the phone.   As with current ATandamp;T phones, callers will be able to useATandamp;T cards or other credit cards to charge calls on thePublic Phone 2000 -- but with the new phones they will simplybe able to insert their card in a slot instead of punching ina charge number.   The new phone, which was designed by ATandamp;T BellLaboratories, is also hearing-aid compatible (a blue grommeton the phone's cord identifies it as such) and the keyboardcan be used as a special TDD (Telecommunications Device forthe Deaf) at no extra charge, ATandamp;T said.   ATandamp;T said it has tested the phones at Newark Airport inNew Jersey and John F. Kennedy Airport in New York and plansto install the phones before the end of the year inDallas/Fort Worth International Airport, OrlandoInternational Airport and San Francisco InternationalAirport. The rest of its current pay phones will be replacedduring 1992.   ATandamp;T has tried setting up business centers -- offices fortravelers -- in some parts of the country with lacklustersuccess. But Mr. Corrigan said &quot;there is no correlationbetween the new phone and the business centers. . . . Thoseare handled by a different business&quot; inside ATandamp;T.   Mr. Corrigan noted that ATandamp;T is awaiting FederalCommunications Commission approval to offer businesstravelers a variety of information services. These includetravel and financial services, and the company has alreadycome up with a weather information service that would beoffered first. For 75 cents ATandamp;T will provide information onweather in the state from which the customer is calling. Fora national service ATandamp;T will charge 95 cents a call.   Customers will be able to plug in their laptops and sendmessages through ATandamp;T EasyLink electronic-mail services orother data services; use special ATandamp;T operators to act asforeign language interpreters; and record one-minute messagesin their own voice for delivery to any phone within one week.   But some customers may find using the special keyboard abit expensive. ATandamp;T plans to charge a rental fee of $2.50 forthe first 10 minutes and $1 for each additional 10 minutes.&quot;Our people didn't find the keyboard charge expensive,&quot; saidMr. Corrigan. &quot;You can read a lot of electronic mail in 10minutes.&quot; And deaf customers can use the keyboard for nothingby dialing a special code when they call in.</TEXT></DOC>
