The varietyof output patterns were observed by weighting on the fiber as well asby bending it after passing a He-Ne laser through a fiber bundle. Thisvariety influenced the matching loss considerably. Then, the effect offormer is larger than the latter, which is caused by the micro bending.And also, the spread of pulse width by weighting is connected with thespread of output pattern. The spread of pulse width was about 3ns atthe most in a 2.3 m length of fiber bundle.</TEXT></DOC>
