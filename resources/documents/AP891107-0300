Sorte, a Drexel executive vicepresident. ``This is a cyclical business.''   Drexel said its new high-yield index will track the performanceof about 700 junk bond issues, or about two-thirds of the $200billion in outstanding junk bonds. It replaces a narrower junk bondindex that monitored 110 issues.   The new index, which Drexel said is the result of months ofresearch, should provide a much broader and clearer picture of theprices of junk-bond issues, which often are difficult to track dueto the thin trading in this market.   Unlike high-yield indexes compiled by some other investmenthouses, Drexel's index will track actual price changes of all thebonds it follows. The prices will be provided by traders who dealin these issues. The so-called matrix indexes compiled by someother Wall Street companies use the prices of a few benchmark bondsto calculate the overall market's performance.   The monthly Drexel index tracks total return on junk bonds,which includes any price changes plus interest payments.   Drexel said the growth of the junk bond market in recent yearsprompted it to devise the new index, which includes the newervariations in high-yield bonds, such as deferred-interest bonds,interest-reset bonds and zero coupon bonds.   High-yield bonds are those rated below investment grade by thecredit rating agencies. They typically are issued by smallcompanies or those lacking a credit history. They also are used toraise money for leveraged buyouts, in which a group buying acompany pledges as collateral the company's assets.   Since they carry a higher risk of default than investment-gradebonds, junk bonds yield more interest.   While saying reports of the death of the junk bond market arepremature, Sorte told reporters the leveraged buyout business thatfueled the issuance of high-yield debt should remain slow for theforeseeable future.   The LBO market was sent in a tailspin when several large, highlypublicized deals began to come apart earlier this year. Somejunk-bond issuers, such as Canadian retailer Campeau Corp. and MervGriffin's Resorts International, said they would have troublepaying interest on their junk bonds, raising questions about theviability of the high-yield market.   Sorte said two factors have crimped the LBO business: The costof raising funds has risen, due to the junk bond troubles, andinvestors in these deals are demanding that they involve less debt.</TEXT></DOC>
