Oil analysts generally attributed the higher prices to technical factors and to indications that petroleum markets appear to be absorbing the increased supplies from OPEC.    North Sea and Middle East crudes were flat to slightly lower on European spot markets. But prices of crude oil as well as petroleum products strengthened in U.S. futures trading.    The futures price of West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery broke through some important technical levels in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange to settle at $18.83 a barrel, up 19 cents. November and December crude contracts rose even more -- 24 cents and 23 cents a barrel, respectively.    Gasoline futures prices also were higher, although heating oil was by far the stronger fuel. Unleaded gasoline for September delivery increased 0.39 cent to settle at 55 cents a gallon. September heating oil was up 0.94 cent to 53.11 cents a gallon.    Few market participants were surprised by the higher fuels prices. Traders noted that gasoline recently has been on a rebound and that the big season for heating oil is just around the corner. &quot;The products are the real story right now, but it looks like crude is following the products,&quot; said Eric Bolling of Edge Trading Corp.    Oil analysts have been watching for some buildup in world oil inventories as a result of OPEC's increased production to around 22 million barrels a day this month, the highest level for the year. But so far no big oil surplus is showing up.    According to Oil Afloat, which tracks movements of oil tankers world-wide, there has, in fact, been a sharp fall in stocks of oil at sea after the second quarter's buildup. &quot;What this means for the supply-demand position is that on-land stock movements need some discounting for the changes which are going on out of sight, at sea,&quot; the British-based publication reports.    Inventories on land are beginning to rise some, but not abnormally so. An increase of 2.1 million barrels in U.S. crude oil stocks to 337.316 million barrels last week, as reported by the American Petroleum Institute, had been expected and resulted in little alarm in the oil markets.    &quot;Stocks are showing that the market is reasonably in balance,&quot; said Lawrence Goldstein, executive vice president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Hog prices dropped sharply as traders appeared to focus once again on the crowded conditions in U.S. hog lots. Keeping their sights down on the farm contrasted with the international outlook powering Tuesday's rally, when speculators ran October hog-futures prices up 1.05 cents a pound on the belief that the Bush administration might ship frozen pork bellies to Poland. The National Pork Producers Council is promoting the exports as a way to support U.S. hog prices and help Poland's consumers. U.S. supplies of frozen pork bellies, which are used to make bacon, hit their highest levels in 18 years this summer. With the immediate outlook for such pork aid having dimmed, sellers knocked October hog-futures prices down .90 cent to 40.77 cents a pound. Pork belly futures closed mixed.    COPPER: Futures prices recovered a little from Tuesday's tumble of more than seven cents. The December contract was up 1.85 cents a pound to $1.256. A news service report that Chilean copper miners had voted to strike and a drop in visible stocks influenced the rebound, but one analyst said: &quot;The market looks tenuous, as if it still hasn't really recovered from the impact of Tuesday's plunge.&quot; The news service report said miners at the Chile Copper Corp.'s Salvador mine had voted to strike as of tomorrow. The mine produces 100,000 tons of refined copper annually, an analyst said. Later, it was reported that union and copper company officials were talking in an effort to prevent the strike. Michael Frawley, metals trader at PaineWebber, said little impact on the market from the strike was anticipated because it wasn't expected to last long. &quot;Copper futures at the moment are struggling from being overbought and the subsequent technical liquidation,&quot; he said. He also noted that today was the first day in which notices to deliver copper against the September position will be issued. &quot;These are momentary depressants which could cause some additional weakness over the short term, but the market's fundamentals are still constructive. World-wide stocks are low, and there continue to be production and labor problems, which could be price-supportive over the long-term,&quot; Mr. Frawley said.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased as the dollar strengthened. December delivery gold was off $1.70 an ounce to $367.60. December silver declined one cent an ounce to $5.21. October platinum was down 40 cents an ounce to $479.20. One analyst observed that the open interest -- the number of contracts that remain to be nullified by an opposite trade or fulfilled by delivery of the commodity -- in gold declined. That meant, he said, Tuesday's price advance was caused mostly by traders buying back contracts they'd previously sold short in anticipation of price declines. &quot;That isn't good for the market,&quot; he said. He also noted that December silver eased to a fresh life-of-contract low for the fourth consecutive session. There continued to be a lack of demand for bullion, which is one reason why precious metals haven't been able to mount and sustain any gains, he said. Another analyst, Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals Advisors Canada, of Toronto, agreed there was very little in the market at the moment to attract traders to precious metals. For one thing, he noted, the more active equity markets were drawing away investment funds. &quot;If precious metals don't have a post-Labor Day pickup, when activity usually increases, a vacuum could develop under the market that could cause prices to fall. If the market can't rally, traders won't want to hold on to their positions,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
