At a meeting late Wednesday at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, about 300 Chinese students shouted down a Chineseconsular official who came from New York to explain the policy,said two Chinese sources speaking on condition of anonymity.   ``It was democracy in action,'' one source said.   The letter, which appeared in Chinese-language newspapers acrossthe United States on Tuesday and Wednesday, said the policy wouldhurt China's drive to modernize its economy.   ``The recent unreasonable changes in the policies on overseasstudy are fundamentally in conflict with the declared nationalpolicy of reform and open door,'' read the letter, which wastranslated by The Associated Press.   The policy will also force many Chinese students in America toreturn to China before obtaining their degrees, the letter said.   The document was accompanied by the names and phone numbers of21 Chinese students and a request for student supporters to addtheir names to the list. By early today, more than 800 students haddone so, Pei said.   Currently, about 40,000 Chinese students are studying abroad,27,000 of them in the United States. Last year, 8,000 students cameto the United States from the People's Republic of China.   Under the new policy, only 600 Chinese would be sent to America,according to Chinese news reports, an official document seen in NewYork and Chinese students who quoted government officials.   Time limits on students studying abroad would also be imposed,said the document, which was obtained from Chinese sources. Thatrule could be particularly difficult for many Chinese, who needtime to master a foreign language before studying their specialty.   A spokesman at China's embassy in Washington acknowledgedWednesday that fewer students would be sent abroad, but deniedthere has been a policy change.   At the MIT meeting, the unidentified consular official confirmedthat a time limit had been placed on studies, the sources said.``He said we have two years to do a masters (degree) and four orfive to get our Ph.D.,'' one source said.   The policy is the result of a struggle between Chinese PremierLi Peng and Communist Party Chairman Zhao Ziyang, said BostonUniversity history professor Merle Goldman.   Zhao backs an ``open-door policy'' and increasingly liberaleconomic reform. Li, a Soviet-educated engineer, wants to limitChina's contact with the West, and is concerned that Chinesestudents studying abroad are becoming too Westernized, Ms. Goldmansaid.   When Chinese students come home, she said, ``they are alreadyinfected by the political values of the United States. They absorbWestern political ideas and that could be troublesome for theChinese state.''   At MIT, the official told students that China has felt the needfor more control over its students since January 1987, when morethan 1,000 Chinese nationals in America signed an open letter toBeijing opposing conservative policies in their homeland, thesources said.   At that point a Chinese student jumped up and yelled, ``Control?What do you mean by control. What kind of word is that?'' thesources said.   Zhang Longxi, a 40-year-old doctoral candidate at Harvard, saidhe did not see the letter as a political statement.   ``It is a bread-and-butter issue for me,'' he said. ``I needtime to study comparative literature.''   ``We are only asking that the right to study and complete ourdegrees be restored to us,'' Pei said.</TEXT></DOC>
