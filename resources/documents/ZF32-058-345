Information Resources Management Service.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>HERSHEY, Pa.andP;  -- To protect the valuable microcomputer procurement toolafforded by indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts, GeneralServices Administration officials said they will monitor IDIQ buys closelyand enforce order limitations.andM;&quot;It's a matter of using it the right way,&quot; said Francis A. McDonough,assistant commissioner of GSA's IRM Service.andP;  &quot;Our role is to ensure thatthere is a vehicle to move large amounts of technology quickly at goodprices.andP;  The best way is to roll them over quickly.&quot;andM;McDonough and other IRMS officials who spoke this month at IRMS' annualconference here credited IDIQ deals with helping to reduce the average age offederal ADPE and improving the federal employee-to-micro ratio.andM;Massive requirements contracts such as the Air Force's $600 million DesktopIII procurement and the Treasury Department's $400 million DepartmentalMicrocomputer Acquisition Contract II have enabled agencies to buy hundredsof thousands of micros, but GSA officials evidently are concerned aboutpotential abuses.andM;McDonough said IRMS will be reluctant to approve any major mico requirementscontracts for more than three years.andP;  Some exemptions might be granted, butan agency must demonstrate a unique need for a longer contract, McDonoughsaid.andM;&quot;We'll approve of a contract provided it meets the agency's needs, but itmust reflect the fast turnaround in products,&quot; McDonough said.andP;  &quot;We thinkupgrades grades are an important part of every contract, but we worry aboutit in years five, six and seven when we're dealing with almost a disposablecommodity.andP;  At some point it no longer works.&quot;andM;Multimillion-dollar requirements contracts also have been hampered byprotests and poor vendor performance, McDonough noted.andP;  DMAC II, forinstance, took Treasury nearly four years from conception to the finalcontract award.andM;Because of problems that have plagued large micro buys, members of Congresshave expressed concern about lengthy contracts in which agencies end uppaying too much for outdated technology.andM;Rep.andP;  John Conyers Jr.andP;  (D-Mich.) recently introduced legislation that wouldbar agencies from using existing contracts to buy more or different computerequipment than was specified in the original contract solicitation.andM;Although not aimed directly at requirements contracts.andP;  Conyers' bill, HR3161, would prohibit agencies from making substantial modifications toexisting contracts, including IDIQ pacts.andM;Most requirements contracts include refreshment clauses that permit upgrades.andO;Conyers' bill, however, would make it more difficult to obtain certain ADPproducts, like micros, using such provisions.andM;&quot;We have a lot of problems with indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity inADP, particularly in PC-type buys where the life span of the technology is 18months and agencies enter into five and 10-year contracts like DMAC,&quot; saidone congressional staff member.andP;  &quot;By the time it gets signed all the productsare obsolete, and the vendor is given the ability to use refreshment clausesand offer products that are totally dissimilar from what the agency signedfor.&quot;andM;Some industry analysts, interviewed after the IRMS conference, said hugerequirements contracts have changed the way agencies build systems, and notalways for the best.andM;Some agencies are using the contracts to buy the hardware and software beforehiring systems integrators to design the overall system, said Bob Dornan, aGCN columnist and vice president of Federal Sources Inc., a McLean, Va.,andO;research and consulting firm.andM;&quot;It used to be mostly for buying IBM-compatible disk drives and tape drives.andO;But that was before PCs,&quot; Dornan said.andP;  &quot;Now it has substantially changed thework for systems integrators.andP;  Agencies say, come in and design this system,but here are the building blocks we want you to use.&quot;andM;IRMS has issued a guide on using requirements contracts to ward offcontracting abuses.andP;  But GSA officials said they still are worried that ifCongress imposes extreme limits, agencies may not have any options formeeting their micro needs.andM;Micro OptionsandM;IRMS' Multiple-Award Schedule program had been a viable alternative.andP;  Butboth the micro and large systems schedules are undergoing a completeoverhaul, and there is no guarantiee agencies will be able to buy comparableamounts of ADPE, McDonough said.andM;Additionally, Conyers has another procurement bill, HR 3162, in the hopper torequire agencies to negotiate prices for schedule buys worth more than $1,000.andM;In the late 1980s, GSA considered a substantial increase in the schedulebuying limit, which is not at $25,000.andP;  But the agency was unable to work outthe details and gain final approval.andM;&quot;We missed a chance for a $300,000 maximum order limit, and now we're behindthe power curve,&quot; McDonough said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
