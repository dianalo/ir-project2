The market for initial publicofferings (IPOs) has been particularly ripe in 1991, doublingto more than $2 billion. But what does it take, both withinventure finance and in the making of public policy, toadvance even that far?   Grant Heidrich heads the &quot;life sciences&quot; practices atMayfield Fund, a leading venture-capital firm in this seedbednear San Francisco. For Mayfield's industry, biotech accountsfor a growing share of a shrinking pool. Venture-capitaldisbursements overall are less than half their peak 1987level, more in line with a decade ago. Firms that have stayedalive say the shakeout means a return to normalcy, whileothers paint a darker picture. Undeniably, bio has felt thefalloff.</LP><TEXT>   Nonetheless, seed money is available, says Mr. Heidrich:&quot;When some great guy or a team walks in the door and says Ihave a terrific idea, there'll be people all over them.&quot; Abigger bio hurdle is second-stage financing; clinical testsand regulatory rigmarole require big chunks of patientcapital.   The tax code is now unfriendly toward this process becausecapital gains are treated as ordinary income (with noallowance for losses or inflation) and because limitedpartnerships for research and development also &quot;werebasically legislated out&quot; in 1986, he says. Depreciationrules and interest rates figure as well.   And, it's harder to get human as well as dollar capital.&quot;The cost of attracting people into entrepreneurial venturesis probably as high as it's ever been,&quot; Mr. Heidrich says.   The birthplace of new technologies is usually at auniversity or publicly funded research lab, he says.Mayfield's team visits 20 to 30 schools a month, and plumbsthe scientific literature, patents and rumor mill. But bioresearchers are less product-oriented than their counterpartsin electronics, he finds. &quot;I don't think they have arealistic sense of going through scientific curiosity andobservation, or a patent or a technical concept, to what ittakes to get it into a human being if it's therapeutic.&quot;   Economic incentives do play a role. And some object,arguing that findings might be falsified in pursuit of gain.The National Institutes of Health (at $5 billion a year, theprimary funding agency) in 1989 promulgated strict curbs oncommercial &quot;conflicts.&quot; If that &quot;had been the policy 15 yearsago, there would be no biotechnology industry today,&quot; saysMr. Heidrich. The idea was dropped.   Meanwhile, a &quot;holier than thou&quot; congressional hunt forimproprieties &quot;dragged a lot of people in front of committeesand scared the hell out of them&quot; and &quot;had a chilling effecton the venture business,&quot; he continues. But to him it's&quot;purely a political issue&quot; -- peer review is too good andprofessional stature too important to invite actualwidespread scientific abuse.   Recently, Rep. John Dingell's tribunal has seized onseemingly extraordinary &quot;indirect-cost&quot; reimbursement ratescharged by institutions such as Mayfield's neighbor andpartner, Stanford University. This is the percentage added ontop of research contracts, such that $100,000 in servicesmight cost $70,000 more to cover facilities and morequestionable &quot;overhead.&quot;   Mr. Heidrich demurs, &quot;These rates are being cut back sofar that I believe it will affect the integrity of researchand science that are going on in various institutions, notjust Stanford. You can argue whether flowers should beincluded or whether a yacht should be included -- all thenice inflammatory things that catch the headlines -- but ifyou add those things, they pale in comparison to {legitimate}costs.&quot;   Established drug companies, though increasingly engaged injoint activities with start-ups, leave a void for venturecapital to fill, he says. &quot;The pharmaceutical industry breedssuch conservatism, because the amount of capital it takes . .. is so high, and it takes so long, that just the normalcareer development of those {executives}, the risks they'retrained to take or to avoid, are very different.&quot;   He contrasts that approach with the computer industry,where a product can be brought on line faster. But othersmaintain this is changing. As technology shortens the(pre-clinical) development periods for new treatments, sayfrom 10 years to three, corporations become more willing tocarry this load and recruit academics away from crowdedcampus labs.   When considering a therapeutics venture, Mayfield looksfor the potential to &quot;partner-off&quot; for cost sharing. &quot;Youhave to have a core technology,&quot; he says, &quot;that is plentybroad so that you've got lots of products you can build intoa portfolio.&quot; Some can then be sold to help nurture a&quot;proprietary asset&quot; for market.   Mr. Heidrich is chairman of one of Mayfield's babies,Cellular Transplants. It seeks to deliver drugs for chronicillness into the body via living cells (from animals, notfetuses, he says). The aim is to mimic the body's naturalprocesses and to minimize the hassle and dosage levels oftraditional injections. The challenge is to resist rejectionof the implant by the immune system of the recipient.   After a year's survey, the company decided to licenseresearch at Washington University in St. Louis, a leader infighting diabetes, and Brown University, which is big onartificial organs and neurological problems.   Mayfield raised $12 million to get rolling in early 1989,and now seeks an additional $15 million in privateplacements, with an IPO to follow. Rhode Island subsidized abase in Providence, near Brown. A physician versed inregulatory issues was brought in as CEO, and Mr. Heidrichpredicts, &quot;We will be in a human clinical trial a year fromnow with treatment for Parkinson's Disease, not far behindthat for long-term chronic diabetes.&quot;   Whereas Cellular Transplants was conceived to expandpatient treatments, with the ultimate bill unknown, Mr.Heidrich says the next biotech wave is &quot;cost-controltechnology, because that's all that's going to be reimbursed&quot;by third-party payers. Stock prices are beginning to reflectthis.   The strong IPO market this year has alleviated some of thefinancial strain on some recent start-ups, and likely enticedthe next round of seed money. (Mr. Heidrich credits aclarifying of patent law, notwithstanding recent newsworthyconflicts, for boosting investor confidence.) But even in ahot climate, venture capitalists can never be sure ofvolatile equity markets. A prominent Mayfield electronicsoffspring, MIPS Computer Systems, has been wracked after asuccessful debut.   So, although new companies might appreciate their ownglobal potential, they will continue to look to a Merck, or aRoche, or to the Far East for alliances. Sometimes the sourcein Japan might surprise Americans: Kirin Beer, for instance,whose fermentation processes link it with life sciences.   All might agree, it's a heady field.</TEXT></DOC>
