Police said 17 people were killed and 49 wounded inhouse-to-house fighting in south Beirut, a warren of narrow alleys,tin-roofed huts and concrete-block apartments that covers 16 squaremiles next to the Beirut airport.   That raised the casualty toll kept by police to 296 killed and1,000 wounded since fighting began May 6 between Hezbollah, theradical group allied with Iran, and the mainline Amal militiasupported by Syria.   In Christian east Beirut, the right-wing Phalange of PresidentAmin Gemayel and the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia,clashed during the night. The militias are rivals for control ofthe capital's Christian sector.   Police said the fight started after Lebanese Forces gunmenwounded Nabil Kahhaleh, Phalange commander in the Sin el-Fildistrict. Police said one person was killed and four were wounded.   Hezbollah, whose name means Party of God, controls 95 percent ofsouth Beirut, where most of the 18 foreigners missing in Lebanonare believed held by Shiite factions linked to the militia. NineAmericans are among the captives.   A police spokesman said Hezbollah fighters ``stormed throughAmal positions'' in the Ghobeiry neighborhood behind a fiercehowitzer and mortar barrage.   He said Amal withdrew into the Shiyah district on the northernedge of the slums. ``Hezbollah now controls the southern andwestern flanks of Shiyah and its gunners are pounding Amal's supplylines on the northern edge,'' said the spokesman, whose name cannotbe used because of regulations.   Syria's soldiers patrol west Beirut and it has 25,000 menstationed in eastern and northern Lebanon.   It deployed 7,500 troops, 100 tanks and 400 armored vehicles onthe southern, western and northern edges of the slums May 15 afterHezbollah had seized most of the slums.   Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who is Lebanon's acting primeminister, has urged Syria to act ``without delay'' to end thefighting.   Amal conceded defeat in Ghobeiry and claimed Palestinianguerrillas from Fatah, the main army of Yasser Arafat's PalestineLiberation Organization, were helping Hezbollah.   The PLO controls Bourj el-Barajneh, a refugee enclave in theShiite slums.   An Amal statement said: ``Hezbollah has managed to achieve somegains in Ghobeiry.''   It said the Hezbollah assault was coordinated by senior officersof the militia and Fatah, and Iranian Revolutionary Guards sentfrom their base in eastern Lebanon. Fatah denied helping Hezbollah.   T-54 tanks and truck-mounted rocket launchers manned by Amalfighters poured fire from Shiyah into Hezbollah territory.   No clear word on the fate of the hostages has emerged since thefight for the Shiite slums began.   Ad-Diyar, a Christian daily newspaper, said two Americancaptives were being held at the Iranian Embassy in Moslem westBeirut. The report did not identify the hosages and could not beverified independently.   Last week, Iranian officials denied reports that some hostageswere held in the basement of the embassy.   The report in Ad-Diyar said Hezbollah ``brought a doctor fromwest Beirut to the southern suburbs to check on a hostage who issuffering from a lung disease.'' It did not elaborate.   A statement Tuesday purporting to be from the pro-IranianIslamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, said the captives would bekilled unless their governments opened direct negotiations with thekidnappers. There was no way to verify the authenticity of thestatement issued in the Bekaa Valley of east Lebanon.   Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press, is the hostage held longest. He was kidnappedMarch 16, 1985.   Fighting in the slums instensified Monday after Syria rejectedan Iranian proposal for a joint peace-keeping force in the slums.   Brig. Gen. Ali Hammoud, chief of Syrian military intelligence inBeirut, said the Iranian proposal was ``out of the question.''   President Hafez Assad of Syria is the main power broker inLebanon after 13 years of civil war, and Iran's main Arab ally inits 7{-year-old war with Iraq.   Despite their alliance, Syria and Iran are involved in astruggle through surrogates for influence with the 1.2 millionShiites, the largest sect in Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
