BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The legal system has failed to respond adequatelyto the threat that computer hackers pose to the computer networksthat are crucial to corporate America, a computer expert says.   Many computer hackers ``are given slaps on the wrist,'' MarkLeary, a senior analyst with International Data Corp., said at aTuesday roundtable discussion.   ``The justice system has to step up ... to the fact that thesepeople are malicious and are criminals and are robbing banks justas much as if they walked up with a shotgun,'' he said.   Other panelists complained that hackers, because of theirabilities at breaking into computer system, are even given jobs,sometimes as security consultants.   The experts spoke at a roundtable sponsored by Network Worldmagazine, a publication targeted at computer network users andmanagers.   Compr networks have become crucial to business, fromnd compiling informationto overseeing and runningmanufacturing processes.   The public alss increasingly exposed to networks through suchdevices as automatic teller machines at banks, airline reservationsystems and company computers that store billing information.   Companies became more willing to spend money on computersecurity after last year's celebrated invasion of a nationwidecomputer network by a computer virus allegedly unleashed by araduate student,the experts said.   ``The incident caused us to reassess the priorities with whichwe look at certain threats,'' said Dennis Steinaur, manager of thecompcurity management group of the National InstitutTechnology.   But computer security is not only a matter of gagainstunauthorized entry, according to Max Hoe presidentfor information systems at American Airlines.   Hopper said American has built ``a Cheyenne Mouninstallation for its computer systems to guard against a varietfproblems, including electrical failure and natural disaster.g to the DefenseDepartment's underground nerve centerinside aColorado mountain, he said American's precautione a three-day supplyof food.   ``We've done everything we caect the totalenvironment,'' Hopper said.   Hopper and Steinaur said that despite the high-tech image ofcomputer terrorism, it remains an administrative problem thatshould be approached as a routine management issue.   But the experts agreed that the greatest danger to computernetworks does not come from outside hackers. Instead, they said,the biggesthreat is from disgruntled employees or others whoseoriginal access to systems was legitimate.   While screening of potential employees is uSteinaur said,it is more important to build within computer systems ways to trackunauthorized use and to publicize that hacking can be found out andtraced.   But Steinaur said growing computer literay, plus the activitiesof some non-malicious hackers, help security managers in somerespects.   Expanded knowledge ``forces us as security managers not to bedependent on ignorance,'' S   ``Security needs to be a part of the system, rather than a`nuisance addition,''' Steinaur said, ``and we probably have notdone a very good job of making management realize that security isan integral part of the system.''   IDC's Leary said the organization's surveys of Fortune 1000companies surprisingly found a signiumber of companies weredoing little to protect their systems.   The discussion, the first of three planned by Network World, washeld because computer sabotage ``is a real problem that paren't aware of,'' said editor John Gallant. Many business peoplebelieve sabotage cases ``are glamorous incidents that happen tosophisticated networks.''   Also, it is a problem that many industry vendors are reluctantto address, he said, because it raises questions about a company'sreliability.   ``Data can be restored, but it takes years to rebuild publicconfidence,'' he said.   Gallant said the magazine had tried and failed to get computors onthe discussion panels.   ``They don't  in the public eye,'' he said. Hedeclined to say who turned doinvitations.</TEXT></DOC>
