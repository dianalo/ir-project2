Westinghouse, which beat out Martin Marietta Corp. for thecontract, will replace the Du Pont Co. as operator of the plant. DuPont, which built the plant and operated it for more than 30 years,announced last fall it would not renew its contract when it expiresnext April.   Joseph Salgado, acting deputy energy secretary, said bothWestinghouse and Martin Marietta offered ``high-caliber proposals''for the operating and management of the plant.   ``The selection process resulted in the choice of the singleproposer which I believe will operate SRP in the best interest ofthis nation,'' Salgado said. ``Westinghouse has considerableexperience in operating national defense facilities for thedepartment.''   Westinghouse, which currently operates six Department of Energynuclear facilities, will begin operations at the Savannah RiverPlant on Nov. 1, working alongside Du Pont officials during afive-month transition period.   Du Pont employees currently working at the plant will beguaranteed continued employment with Westinghouse under terms ofthe contract, according to DOE spokeswoman Chris Sankey.   ``We are extremely excited and very pleased at our selection,''said John C. Marous, chairman and chief executive officer ofWestinghouse. ``We are committed to total quality of all phases ofoperation at the Savannah River Plant.''   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, said the selection of Westinghouse ``and a timelytransition will help to ensure that operations at Savannah Riverare conducted in a safe and efficient manner.''   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said Westinghouse officials haveassured him that they will operate the plant ``with the highestlevel of quality and productivity'' and will comply with all``state-of-the-art environmental practices.   ``In addition, Westinghouse has agreed to work for animprovement in the quality of life in the surrounding communitiesand to use the university structure in the state to assist inresearch and development at the Savannah River Plant,'' Thurmondsaid.   Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., whose district includes the giantplant near Aiken, S.C., and the Georgia border, said he was``tremendously impressed'' with Westinghouse officials duringmeetings prior to the awarding of the contract.   ``There is no doubt in my mind about their commitment to thesafe operation of SRP and their ability to ensure that localcitizens and the environment are not harmed by SRP operations,''Derrick said.   Energy Secretary John Herrington last month recommended theSavannah River Plant as the site for construction of a new``state-of-the-art'' nuclear reactor to produce all the tritiumneeded for the nation's nuclear weapons program. He alsorecommended constructon of a smaller nuclear reactor to produceweapons materials in Idaho.   The new reactors eventually would replace three aging reactorsat SRP and one at the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washingtonstate. The three SRP reactors all currently are shut down formaintenance or safety reasons, and the Hanford reactor was placedon ``cold standby'' earlier this year.   Westinghouse has submitted a proposal to DOE to design and buildthe new production reactor at SRP, but Ms. Sankey, the DOEspokeswoman, said the award of a contract for that project probablywon't occur before next spring at the earliest.</TEXT></DOC>
