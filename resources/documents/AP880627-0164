She said the ``greenhouse effect,'' in which manmade pollutiontrapped in the atmosphere is warming up the planet's surface,presents humanity with a crucial question:   ``Will we devote our abilities, our energy, and our efforts tofurther short-term material well-being, or will we commit ourselvesto enhancing life on planet Earth?''   Addressing more than 300 scientists from 40 countries,Brundtland called for a new ``holistic'' ethic in which economicgrowth and environmental protection go hand-in-hand around theworld.   She is chairwoman of the U.N. World Commission on Environmentand Development, whose report last year, ``Our Common Future,'' washailed as a landmark.   Brundtland said rich nations have a special responsibility.   ``We have been playing lethal games with vital life-supportsystems,'' the prime minister told participants in the Canadiangovernment-sponsored World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere.   ``For too long have we used the atmosphere, soil and water asthe ultimate sink of our industrial excesses.''   Her five-part plan calls for transfer of modern, low-pollutingtechnology to Third World countries now, so they won't repeat thesame mistakes made by industrialized nations.   The plan also urges a standstill in energy use by the year 2000,followed by efforts to reduce production and consumption levels,and therefore pollution.   Other points include more worldwide research on renewable energysources and climatic change, and consideration of a globalconvention on atmospheric protection.   The meeting was inspired by the Brundtland Commission's reportand was convened amidst the worst drought for 50 years across theNorth American farm belt.   But scientists said they were reluctant to connect the droughtwith the long-term greenhouse effect caused by emissions of carbondioxide, nitrous oxide, ozone and methane. Most of the gases arebyproducts from burning coal, gas, oil and wood.   ``The 1970s and 1980s have produced summer warming andincreasing incidence of severe drought,'' said Kenneth Hare,chairman of Canada's Climate Program Planning Board.   ``It's possibly the greenhouse effect at work, but our modelsare not accurate enough to say it is,'' he added. ``However,summers like this may well become more frequent and more extensivein the future.''   Hare said concentration of the greenhouse gases will double inthe first half of the 21st century, raising average temperatures byup to 7 degrees, causing sea levels to rise and regional climatesto alter.   With less moisture available, he said, ``winter wheat may wellbe the standard crop of the future in the Canadian prairies insteadof the spring wheat we grow now.''   Hare said nations should prohibit chemical compounds responsiblefor the toxic gases and negotiate an international energy protocolthat would encourage hydroelectric power and re-examine the role ofnuclear energy.   Robert T. Watson, chief of the Upper Atmosphere Research Programat the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, saidcombating the greenhouse effect will be much more complex thattackling ozone depletion.   Twenty-four nations signed the 1987 Montreal Protocol onprotecting the Earth's ozone layer by restrictingchlorofluorocarbons, the chemicals used in aerosol sprays,insulation, refrigerators and industrial cleaning. The ozone layerprotects the Earth from the sun's most harmful ultraviolet rays.   But Watson said the buildup of methane gas in the atmosphere,closely entwined with many industrial processes, is more mysterious.   In opening the conference, Canada's Prime Minister BrianMulroney offered to act as host for a U.N. World Conference onSustainable Development in 1992.   Mulroney also urged participants to start working on aninternational ``law of the air'' that would discourage airpollution in the way the International Law of the Sea controls theoceans.   But Watson said it was premature to start work on such aninternational covenant, since researchers have much more to learn.   ``It's quite clear that energy conservation is a good idea. Theless energy we burn, the less CO2 (carbon dioxide) will go into theatmosphere. But how you translate that into international policy isanother matter,'' Watson said.</TEXT></DOC>
