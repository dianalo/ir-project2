First it must be disassembled, says Lt. Gen. Frank Camm, aretired Army nuclear weapons planner who managed nuclearweapons production in the 1970s. The process is regularlyperformed in small rooms with movable walls at Pantex Plant,a government-owned facility located 20 miles east ofAmarillo, Texas.</LP><TEXT>   The heart of most weapons is a plutonium core or &quot;pit,&quot; ametal ball that must be compressed to create the nuclearexplosion. The plutonium is compressed by a carefully timedignition of a sphere of conventional explosives wrappedaround it.   Most nuclear weapons are designed so the plutonium can'texplode without the proper electronic codes, but during thedisassembly process the conventional explosives can go off.&quot;We designed the process so that if one of these things goesflap bang, the people around it may get hurt, but outside theroom it would be safe,&quot; explains Gen. Camm.   However, if plutonium is near a conventional explosion, itbecomes a poisonous gas that causes lung cancer, so elaborateventilation systems must be maintained. &quot;The technology isnow to the point where we may be able to do a lot of this byremote control,&quot; Gen. Camm says. He believes Soviet nuclearweapons are a lot cruder than U.S. arms, and that may makethem easier to disassemble.   The next problem is what to do with the plutonium, anunstable metal that remains radioactive and toxic forthousands of years. There are a variety of ways to destroyplutonium, all time-consuming. It can be mixed with uraniumoxide and used as fuel in nuclear power plants. But theplants then create tons of poisonous waste, containing moreplutonium, which must be safely stored.   Soviet scientists have suggested that nuclear weaponscontaining plutonium can be destroyed by underground nuclearexplosions at their Arctic test site, Novaya Zemlya. That'sno solution at all, says Theodore B. Taylor, a formerdesigner of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons. &quot;You can make amess that way, but it won't destroy the plutonium,&quot; he says.&quot;It will just be distributed underground somewhere,&quot; perhapsto migrate into ground water.   Rather than guard plutonium storage sites forever, U.S.and Soviet scientists may eventually be driven to a solutionthat is, quite literally, far out, says Mr. Taylor: &quot;The moreI think about it, the more I think we should be givingserious study to the possibility of loading this materialinto a space ship and firing it into the sun.&quot;   (See related article: &quot;Arms Control: The Risk Now Posed Bythe Soviet `Nukes' Is One of Management --- The Red Army Hasto Move, Destroy or Store Weapons While Preventing Theft ---Evacuating a German Bunker&quot; -- WSJ Nov. 20, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
