The House Energy and Commerce Committee, on a voice vote withoutdissent, sent the measure to the full House, where even itsstrongest critics say approval is likely.   A similar measure has been introduced but not yet act on in theSenate.   The legislation would complete a price decontrol process thatbegan in 1978 with the Natural Gas Policy Act, which removed pricelimits on certain kinds of gas while also establishing two dozencategories of gas, each with a ceiling price.   About one-third of U.S. natural gas currently is subject tofederal price controls.   The House bill, sponsored by Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., wouldlift the remaining price controls as supply contracts expire or arerenegotiated, with all such limits to be removed by Jan. 1, 1993.Controls would be ended immediately for gas not subject to acontract on the date of the legislation's enactment.   Past efforts by the gas industry to win price-controllegislation foundered on fears that prices paid by the 48 millionhouseholds using natural gas would increase.   Such concerns have faded. The collapse of oil prices in 1986,coupled with the effects of moves by the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission to liberalize the gas industry, led to falling gasprices, excess supplies and greatly increased competition.   ``I think gas prices are going to fall'' if full decontrol isenacted, said Rep. Billy Tauzin, D-La. Any price movements areexpected to be small because most of the controlled gas alreadysells at prices below the federally set ceilings.   Industry officials contend that ending federal price regulationwill stimulate production and use of natural gas without leading tohigher consumer bills.   ``For consumers this will mean supply and demand, not arcanegovernment regulations, will set natural gas prices with the leastexpensive gas being produced first,'' Nicholas J. Bush, presidentof the Natural Gas Supply Association, said after the Housecommittee vote. His group represents gas producers.   Some consumer organizations oppose the House decontrol bill,although they acknowledge that lifting the price limits is notlikely to mean higher consumer bills. Their main objection is thatthe legislation ignores other, more significant, gas issues thatare having the effect of inflating home heating bills.   ``This bill does nothing for consumers,'' said Edwin S.Rothschild, assistant director of the Citizen-Labor EnergyCoalition.   Rothschild and other consumer advocates say Congress should betackling such related issues as the ``take-or-pay'' problem that isforcing consumers to help pay the cost of voiding high-pricedsupply contracts taken by pipelines in the late 1970s when, unliketoday, supplies were tight and prices were rising.   The Bush administration strongly supports gas decontrol, andWatkins has said a liberalized gas industry is part of his overallstrategy for strengthening the nation's energy base and reversingthe trend toward higher energy imports.   The decontrol move comes at a time of growing political andcommercial support for expanding the use of natural gas, whichcurrently accounts for about one-quarter of the country's energysupply. Gas is gaining popularity in part because it is consideredmore environmentally benign than oil and other fossil fuels.   A Senate bill, for example, calls for spending $100 million overthree years to finance demonstration projects that use natural gasfor mass transit and training programs for conversion of gasolineand diesel-fueled vehicles to run on natural gas.   The House panel also approved legislation to create anindependent, 11-member commission to recommend to President Bushand the Congress a comprehensive approach to cleaning up toxic andradioactive wastes at the Energy Department's nuclear weaponsplants. Energy Secretary James D. Watkins opposes that bill.</TEXT></DOC>
