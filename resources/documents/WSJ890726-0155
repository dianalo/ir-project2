Nearly 3,300 judges nationwide have decided that they, too, need malpractice insurance.    &quot;Judges are sued far more often than the public would believe,&quot; says Kent Batty, court administrator for the state courts in Wayne County, Mich. &quot;And for the past few years, there's been a mounting concern over liability.&quot;    Judge Phillip J. Roth of the Oregon Supreme Court says, &quot;Judges realize now that one moment they can be on the bench and the next, they're in the pit being defended.&quot; Judge Roth, chairman of the Judicial Immunity Committee of the American Bar Association, says at least 800 suits are filed against judges each year.    On the average, between 250 and 300 insurance claims are filed by judges each year, says Frank Bolen, a partner at Herbert L. Jamison andamp; Co., the West Orange, N.J., insurance broker that handles judicial liability policies for National Union Fire Insurance Co., the nation's largest supplier. About 3,000 state judges and 300 federal judges have policies now, he says. (There are many more state judges than federal judges in the country.)    Until the mid-1980s, not a judge in the land would have considered buying malpractice insurance. Under common law, English judges were guaranteed absolute immunity from litigation related to their judicial duties -- and the immunity extended to the New World.    &quot;The traditional rule recognizes that judges operate in a glass bowl and protects them by making the glass unbreakable,&quot; wrote Judge Roth in a recent article, &quot;The Erosion of Judicial Immunity.&quot; Absolute immunity was considered necessary to insulate judges from vexatious litigants. For years, suits against judges were &quot;extremely rare,&quot; the judge says.    In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld judicial immunity in a case in which a judge had granted a mother's petition for her daughter's sterilization. After marrying, the daughter sued the judge, claiming a denial of due process. In essence, the court ruled that judicial independence was more important than the civil rights of the plaintiff. The case, as it turns out, was the high-water mark for judicial immunity. In May 1984, the nation's highest court seemed to alter course.    That year, the court ruled in favor of two plaintiffs who claimed that a state judge in Virginia had violated their constitutional rights by incarcerating them while they awaited trial for nonjailable offenses. The court upheld an injunction against the judge's action and instructed the judge to pay the plaintiffs' attorney fees under a federal statute.    That decision, says Judge Roth, &quot;opened the door to litigation. It hit judges right where they sit.&quot;    The Virginia judge ended up paying more than $30,000 in legal fees to the plaintiff. The judge was not insured, although she could have been: In 1981, Complete Equity Markets Inc. in Wheeling, Ill., had begun offering policies to judges.    Then in 1984, National Union joined the market. Its policy for state judges -- the biggest clients -- costs $800 a year for a $1 million policy with no deductible. &quot;The judges are covered for acts, errors or omissions in the performance of professional duties,&quot; Mr. Bolen says.    The policy covers the client's legal expenses in all cases unless the judge pleads guilty to a criminal act or it is proven that he or she intentionally committed a crime. It also covers damages and the payment of plaintiffs' attorneys fees in negligence cases related to the judge's duties. Federal judges have similar coverage under a different program.    In 1984, state judges filed 46 claims with Mr. Bolen's firm, he says. In 1985, the number soared to 185 claims. Now it has leveled off at 250 a year. Mr. Bolen says that a large part of the claims are frivolous &quot;harassment suits,&quot; although some do go to trial. Currently, he says, a case is pending in which the judge's legal fees have already passed $100,000 and could go to $300,000.    Though most judges take out individual policies, some state judges have group coverage paid for by the state. The states include Ohio, Vermont, South Dakota and Rhode Island, according to Judge Roth. Though Michigan has no group coverage, Mr. Batty, the state court administrator, says all 64 judges in Wayne County have been covered for four years by individual policies bought by the state.    The number of federal judges showing interest in the program is growing. &quot;The cost of this insurance is relatively cheap for what you get,&quot; says U.S. District Judge Frank A. Kaufman of Baltimore.    Mr. Bolen stresses that his firm doesn't believe in advertising its judicial malpractice coverage. &quot;If everyone looks at judges and knows they're covered,&quot; he says, &quot;there's a likelihood of more suits.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
