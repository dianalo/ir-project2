SQUID containig different S-c-S point contacts as the weak linkare compared with various theoretical models. The formulae followingfrom the RSJ model with weak and strong damping and the microscopic treatmentof quantum effects in S-c-S junctions are analysed. It is concluded thatonly the latter theory provides a quantitative agreement with the experimentalvalues.</TEXT></DOC>
