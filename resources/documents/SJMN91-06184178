Thecity's environmental consultant says rapid algae growth is good for the fishhabitat because it helps aerate the water, said operations manager DickMcKinney.;    &quot;I don't know of any actual pollution or septic leak in theriver,&quot; McKinney said. &quot;In past tests, no one found any contamination.&quot;;   Dead salmon, steelhead;  Lazarotti is worried because days after thefreshwater sport fishing season opened last fall, fishermen pulled ahalf-dozen dead salmon and steelhead out of the lower part of the river. Hesaid a test of the water at the mouth of the river found the oxygen levelswere too low to sustain fish life.;    To boost oxygen in the river, fishermenbroke open a sandbar at the river's mouth to allow ocean water to mix in.;   &quot;After we dug open the sandbar, a dozen or more dead salmon and steelhead werepicked up in the river,&quot; Lazarotti said. &quot;Then large schools of salmon wouldcome to the mouth of the river, and then turn away and go back to sea.&quot;;   Freshwater breeders;  Fishermen say the fact the salmon and steelhead wererepelled from the river is especially distressing because both species breedin fresh water. Salmon and steelhead are hatched in fresh water and spend mostof their first year in coastal rivers and streams before migrating into theocean. After several years in salt water, the fish return to their nativestreams to spawn.;    While steelhead trout can return to the ocean afterbreeding, salmon die shortly after spawning. Fishery experts are unsurewhether salmon are genetically programmed to die shortly after reaching sexualmaturity or whether they can survive if they are prevented from spawning.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TERRI MORGAN, Special to the Mercury News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910702  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  358  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday July 2, 199100184178,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
