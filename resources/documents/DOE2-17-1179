<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-17-1179 </DOCNO><TEXT>The efficiency of oxygen vacancy defect creation in samples of amorphousSiO/sub 2/ subjected to ultraviolet laser or ionizing particle radiation(energetic H/sup +/ ions) has been measured as a function of sample temperatureduring irradiation. For the case of laser radiation (E/sub photon/ {approx_equal}5 eV) we find that vacancy centers are only created when the irradiationtemperature is above 150 K. The efficiency of peroxy radical defect creationobserved after post irradiation annealing is consistent with the behaviourof the oxygen vacancy creation efficiency. In samples with energeticprotons, the opposite behaviour is observed and one finds that defectcreation is enhanced as the implantation temperature is lowered. Possiblephysical mechanisms controlling the defect creation efficiency as a functionof sample temperature and radiation are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
