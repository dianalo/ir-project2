The objective of thisprogram is to address automation of distribution as a total system, ratherthan automation of individual features. This work is geared towards developinga compatible, modular automation system to benefit gas utilities. Thesystem must have an open architecture so that any manufacturer can produceequipment that will be compatible with all other system components. Thereare approximately 30 capabilities that the laboratory system will ultimatelydemonstrate, and 10 are now functional. These include: gas meter reading,bill calculation and printing, multiple rate billing, tamper detection,electronic reconfiguration, global commands, remote city gate stationcontrol, district meter reading, cathodic protection potential reading,and automatic differential pressure reading.</TEXT></DOC>
