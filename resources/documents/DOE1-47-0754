<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-47-0754 </DOCNO><TEXT>The spectral characteristics and flow structural response of the combustorswirling flowfield subject to downstream boundary disturbance are investigated.Two types of disturbance are imposed at the downstream boundary. Theyare downstream contraction and asymmetric disturbance. Three naturalfrequencies are noted in different regions of the swirling flowfield.Downstream contraction usually causes compression of the central recirculationzone into two side-lobes, increases the PVC's (precession vortex core)fundamental frequency and decreases its oscillation energy. For asymmetricdisturbance, such as the passing of the turbine blades, the PVC's fundamentalfrequency is not altered below certain critical disturbance amplitudeand the precession energy drops tremendously. In addition, the precessionenergy is enlarged as the excitation frequency approaches the PVC's fundamentalfrequency. 12 references.</TEXT></DOC>
