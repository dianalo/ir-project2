By measuring the changesin compressional (P)- and shear (S)-wave attenuation and velocity underuniaxial and triaxial testing conditions, their effectiveness for distinguishingchanges in applied load and structural failure of the sample can be observed.The velocity and attenuation values were used in further calculationssuch as ratios of P-wave to S-wave attenuation and velocity values, dynamicelastic constants, normalized velocities, and attenuation coefficientsto reveal any trends that may exist upon loading and failure. The behaviourof both P-wave and S-wave attenuation and velocity considered togetherdefine distinct and consistent phases of load change and failure underuniaxial and triaxial testing conditions. The S-wave attenuation andvelocity are more sensitive than those of the P-wave to changes in axialload and the initial development of microfractures within the samplepreceding structural failure. The attenuation and velocity ratio curvesand the dynamic elastic constant curves are not very sensitive to changesin load, but are responsive to structural failure of the coal sample.The attenuation coefficient and normalized velocity curves revealed thesame trends observable in the original velocity and attenuation curves.18 refs., 11 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
