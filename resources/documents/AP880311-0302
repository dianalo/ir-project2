Friday sued Shearson Lehman HuttonInc. and British investor Brian Beazer, accusing them of violatingsecurities laws in trying to acquire the Pittsburgh-based chemicalsand construction company.   Koppers said it was attempting to break up ``an ongoing illegalscheme ... to acquire control of Koppers in blatant violation ofthe disclosure requirements'' of securities laws.   Koppers asked the court to block the Shearson and aBeazer-controlled investor group from acquiring any more of thecompany's stock and to award damages over the alleged manipulationof the stock.   BNS Partners on March 3 offered $45 per common share and $107.75per preferred share, or $1.26 billion for shares it did not alreadycontrol. The offer is scheduled to expire March 30.   BNS is a general partnership, 49 percent owned by BrightAggregates Inc., of Dallas, itself a unit of Beazer PLC. TheBritish company is chaired by Beazer.   ``Shearson proposed making a tender offer for Koppers to ...Beazer. Shearson was and remains the driving force behind theoffer, and it controls the offer,'' Koppers said.   Shearson officials did not immediately return telephone callsfor comment. ``Despite the fact that Shearson has combined with anEnglish predator to dismember an American company, it holds itselfout to the public as assisting businesses in protecting againsttakeovers,'' the suit said.   The lawsuit claims that the terms of the takeover financing areso vague that is questionable.   ``BNS does not have adequate funding to complete the offer andhas obtained only a self-styled commitment for only about one-thirdof the amount that it will require,'' the suit said.   Koppers claims the offer is misleading in light of Beazer'ssubsequent comments on plans to sell Koppers' chemical and buildingproducts businesses, which together account for 40 percent ofannual sales.   ``Koppers stockholders are being misled as to the value of thestock they are being asked to tender,'' the suit said.</TEXT></DOC>
