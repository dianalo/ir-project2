The samemight now be said for the Paris bourse.   Shares of France-based Societe Nationale Elf Aquitainehave long been low-priced, relative to intrinsic value and tothe level of other major oil companies. But since Aug. 3, theday after Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, Elf's shares, as quotedin Paris, have plunged 27% to 263 French francs ($51.73). Inthe U.S., where American depositary receipts for Elf tradeover the counter, Elf trades at about $26 an ADR, with eachADR representing one-half share.</LP><TEXT>   As it may be said that the only thing less predictablethan the Mideast war is the price of oil that will resultfrom it, shares of any oil company can be deemed aspeculation. But Elf's shares are trading so low that, foranyone willing to make a few modest assumptions -- say, thatthe war will eventually end, and that when it does, the sunwill continue to rise much as it has before -- Elf's shareslook undeniably cheap.   &quot;By virtually any yardstick, Elf's shares representremarkably good value,&quot; according to Bernard Picchi ofSalomon Brothers. Susan Graham of Merrill Lynch calls Elf&quot;the forgotten oil company.&quot; Morgan Stanley's conclusion maybe stated in one word, &quot;buy.&quot;   With a bit more than 2.5 billion barrels of reserves inoil and natural gas equivalents, Elf is big league by anymeasure. Ranked by reserves, it stood ninth among the world'spublicly traded companies at the end of 1989, ahead of Unocaland trailing Texaco.   Yet its stock is trading at a mere six and a half timesestimated 1990 earnings of about $8 a share. This compareswith a price-earnings multiple of 12.4, according to SalomonBrothers, for the eight largest oil companies: RoyalDutch/Shell, Exxon, British Petroleum, Amoco, Mobil, Chevron,Atlantic Richfield and Texaco.   Elf's shares, further, are trading at merely 2.7 timescash flow; its eight big sisters trade at a price-cash flowmultiple of 5.0.   There would seem to be no good reason for Elf's lowvaluation. Though it is 56%-owned by the French government,in other respects it resembles the more familiar U.S. oilcompanies. Elf is fully integrated, and, as with many U.S.companies, it has spent dearly to modernize and cut outexcess capacity in refining and marketing. It is diversifiedwith chemicals, which provided 36% of operating profit in the1990 first half, and with smaller businesses inpharmaceuticals and beauty products (including lines such asOscar de la Renta and Nina Ricci).   Also -- and this isn't common to oil majors -- it hasmanaged, through a better-than-average exploration record andaggressive acquisitions, to increase both production andreserves in recent years. And Elf, which derives abouttwo-thirds of its oil production from West Africa and most ofits gas from the North Sea and France, seems set to continuespending heavily on finding and developing reserves.Production should thus be reasonably stable.   Its chemical business has expanded quickly, owing in partto its 1989 acquisition of Philadelphia-based Pennwalt Corp.The recession in the U.S., and perhaps elsewhere in Europe,could slow this business in 1991. But Elf's balance sheet isstrong; debt is only about 24% of total capital. Overall, Mr.Picchi's view at Salomon, that &quot;no sensible quantativeargument can be made against Elf,&quot; holds up.   Elf's stock suffers, he says, for reasons having little todo with substance. Its ADRs are traded over the counter onthe so-called pink sheets generally inhabited by stockswithout much following. Trading is thin, and retail brokeragecommissions run to as much as 50 cents an ADR. Perhapsinvestors here -- and even in Britain -- are turned off bythe whiff of an apparently obscure company.   Yet Elf, which says it has the largest total stock-marketvalue of any company in France, and which is increasinglyturning to markets outside France to market its oil, ishardly obscure in any substantive sense. What's more, Elfsays it plans to seek a New York Stock Exchange listing forits ADRs this year. Mr. Picchi recommends that investorspurchase shares &quot;now, before U.S. investors become morefamiliar&quot; with them.   John Wellemeyer of Morgan Stanley notes that &quot;the mostcritical variables for Elf's earnings&quot; are future oil prices.As these prices are unpredictable, profit forecasts are ofdubious value. But this hardly matters. Given any reasonable,or even a somewhat unreasonable, variation in oil prices,with Elf's shares at current prices, the odds are tilted inthe investor's favor.   ---   Elf Aquitaine Shares   Weekly closings (in French francs)   Business: Oil and gas, chemicals                                                                                                          Year ended Dec. 31, 1989:   Revenue: $24.88 billion   Net income: $1.13 billion; or $5.26 a share                                                                                                          Shares outstanding: 245.5 million                                                                                                          Note: All figures are in U.S. dollars using 1989conversion rate</TEXT></DOC>
