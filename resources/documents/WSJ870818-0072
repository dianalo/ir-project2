That's what the latest annual statistics on U.S. households suggest.    For the first time since the mid-1960s, the growth in non-family households -- mainly singles -- came to a virtual halt this year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's latest Current Population Survey. In the 1970s, the number of such households soared 77.7%, five times the rise in family households.    &quot;It's pretty amazing,&quot; says Peter Francese, president of American Demographics magazine. &quot;Most demographic trends don't disappear that quickly.&quot;    One year's statistic doesn't always portend a trend, and young adults are still much more likely to live alone today than they were a generation ago. Still, the rise in single-member households has been slowing since the early 1980s, when there was a recession. That's when many newly jobless young adults moved back with Mom and Dad.    Demographers cite several theories for the singles standstill. Andrew Cherlin, a professor of sociology at Johns Hopkins University, believes more young adults are living at home after school and before they marry to save money and get established in a career. Census Bureau figures support that view, showing that the percentage of people 18-to-24 years old living with their parents increased to 52.6% in 1986 from 48.4% in 1980.    &quot;I asked a cousin whose children are finishing college how she would enjoy being an 'empty-nester,'&quot; Mr. Cherlin says. &quot;She smiled ruefully and said, 'They're all coming back home.'&quot;    The plateau in the number of non-family households -- about 25 million of the 89.5 million total U.S. households -- also may reflect the shrinking ranks of young adults, who are more likely to live alone. The number of people 18-to-24 years old has declined about 10% since 1980.    Furthermore, Arlene Saluter, a Census Bureau specialist in marriage and family statistics, suspects the cost of living -- especially high housing costs -- has climbed above the ability of many young adults to manage without getting married to another wage earner or living with parents. Indeed, that population is the only age group to experience a drop in income since 1980. The median household income of the 15-to-24-year-old group declined 9.5% to $15,300 in 1986 from $16,900 in 1980, after adjusting for inflation.    At the same time that fewer people are deciding to live alone, more people are getting married -- further diminishing the relative statistical importance of the living-alone crowd. In fact, married couples made up nearly 60% of new households formed in the past year, up from 35% the year earlier and just 12% in 1983-1984 period.    Mr. Francese attributes the rise in the number of marriages to the fact that Americans born in 1957 -- the peak post-war baby-boom year -- are turning 30. &quot;As people get older, they tend to marry and settle down,&quot; he says.    Last year, the median age of women getting married -- 23.1 years -- was the highest since the Census Bureau began compiling such data in the late 1800s. (The previous high was 22 years, in the 1890s). For men, the median age for marrying was 25.7 in 1986, still slightly below the peak 25.9 years in 1900.    Whatever the reasons, the shift away from non-family households may affect the economy in numerous ways. Demand for rental apartments may fall, for instance. &quot;It suggests a shift away from rental units, such as one-bedroom apartments to owner-occupied dwellings,&quot; says William Serow, an economics professor and associate director of Florida State University's Center for Population Studies.    Meanwhile, restaurants may see less business as young adults living with their parents opt for more home-cooked meals. And Ms. Saluter suggests that young adults staying at home actually will have more spending money for consumer goods. &quot;I know I'd have a lot more money if I lived with my mother,&quot; she says.    ---    Households in Change   Married couples as a percentage of all new households     1986-87                 60%    1985-86                 35%    1984-85                 19%    1983-84                 12%   Source: American Demographics</TEXT></DOC>
