This studyinvolves the development of SODAR experimental and quality assurancetechniques as well as a methodology for determining the stability classof each sensed height level and, subsequently, the mixing height itself.Mixing height results and the relevant predictive regression model arepresented for Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.</TEXT></DOC>
