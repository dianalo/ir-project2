They are not grants or loans from the U.S. Treasury, norare they to be added to Israel's annual foreign aid package from the UnitedStates.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ISRAEL DESERVES LOAN GUARANTEE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Commentary; Jeffrey Y. Santis is Peninsula coordinator of the SanFrancisco-based Jewish Community Relations Council, which represents 60 BayArea Jewish congregations and organizations.  </MEMO><TEXT>     All Israel is requesting of the United States is to guarantee, or co-sign,these loans which would allow Jerusalem to borrow from private banks atfavorable interest rates and for terms of up to 30 years rather than a maximumof only seven years.;   Israel would then borrow $2 billion a year for fiveyears to help in the resettling of hundreds of thousands of Jews who arefleeing growing uncertainties in the dissolving Soviet Union and dangerouscircumstances in Ethiopia.;   The costs of absorbing the nearly one millionexpected new immigrants is staggering. Some $50 billion will be needed forsome 12,000 new classrooms for 300,000 new students, for 260,000 homes, fornew roads, for new water and sewage systems, and for about 360,000 new jobs.;  Israelis themselves are readily bearing the overwhelming bulk of the costs.Already taxed at 46 percent, they face the possibility of increased personaland sales taxes and a certain drop in their standard of living. World Jewryhas contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to the resettlement projectand American Jewry, through its community institutions, has even guaranteedsome $900 million in loans intended for the new immigrants. But even all thisisn't enough and that is why Israel must borrow additional funds.;   The coststo American taxpayers will be minimal and there is little risk involved.First, according to the Bank of America, Israel is one of only two countrieswhich has a perfect repayment record. Second, Israel has offered to pay allthe bookkeeping costs on the amount the United States would co-sign.Additionally the loan guarantees will help generate an expansion of Israel'seconomy, some 20 percent in the next three years, and a variety of Americanindustries will profit from this.;   For instance, America's housing industry,now in a recession, is already greatly benefiting from Israel's need forprefabricated homes. This, in turn, is boosting America's merchant marinewhich ships the prefabs to Israel.;   Unfortunately, the Bush administrationhas decided to ask Israel once again to delay its request for the loanguarantees for four months despite strong congressional support for grantingIsrael the guarantees now. The first delay was six months ago in February atthe end of the gulf war. Israel complied with this request despite 41 IraqiScud missile attacks without retaliating and even though Egypt was forgivensome $7 billion in debts owed directly to U.S. taxpayers.;   Some haveasserted that no threat exists against the 2.5 million Jews in what's left ofthe Soviet Union and a delay in granting the guarantees poses no danger. Butthis is a gross misperception. In the last two years anti-Semitic assaultsthroughout the Soviet Union have increased.;   The Soviet Union is a tinderboxof ethnic hatreds which could erupt into street violence, civil war, orinter-republic wars. After all, independence doesn't necessarily meandemocracy, and the emerging republics are vulnerable to nationalistic passionswhich in the past have proven deadly for Jews.;   The Bush administration doesdeserve a great deal of praise for managing to arrange a peace conference nextmonth between Israel and the Arab states.;   Ironically, the Arabs have nevermade a moratorium in West Bank settlements a requirement for theirparticipation in the peace talks.;   Arab governments probably will now beprompted to make the loan guarantees and the settlements a major issue. Theyare likely to interpret the president's stand to mean they needn't beforthcoming and could stake out a harder line since Israel alone will bereceiving heavy American pressure.;   While it is appropriate to expect theUnited States to place pressure on all parties as negotiations progress, thetying of a humanitarian issue to a political one prior to the talks onlyweakens Washington's ability to act as an impartial arbitrator.;   Loanguarantees are a must. The urgency of the situation for Soviet Jews, andremaining Ethiopian Jews, requires nothing less.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JEFFREY Y.
