 The new version is the fourth operating system platform-and thefirst non-PC hardware platform-for the popular desktop publishing program.andM;The Macintosh version of Ventura Publisher 3.0 is functionally equivalent tothe Pc versions, but it fully complies with the Mac user interface.andP;  Like therecently released Windows version, it eliminates the modules of the originalversion in favor of all actions from pull-down menus.andM;Xerox said it expects to release a finished product in the fourth quarter ofthis year.andM;We were not able to see the Mac product before going to press, but Xeroxindicated that several new features commonly found on Macintosh programswould be incorporated:andM;* A spelling checker (based on a Houghton Mifflin dictionary).andM;* Undo-redo of a previous action.andM;* Movable dialog boxes.andM;* Apply/cancel to experiment with style changes without leaving the dialogbox.andM;Level playing field.andP;  The port to the Macintosh is part of Ventura's newthrust to offer Ventura Publisher on all major desktop platforms.andM;The porting effort has accelerated since the Ventura organization was spunoff as a separate business unit led by Larry Gerhard.andP;  Gerhard, the formerCEO of Decision Data, took the helm last October.andP;  A month later, at Comdex,Xerox announced Ventura Publisher Triumph Series, a software package thatcombined Ventura Publisher 2.0, the Professional Extension and the NetworkServer into one package.andP;  The Triumph Series was announced for DOS Gem,Windows and OS/2 environments.andM;The new labeling is the Gold Series, which includes the Macintosh version.andO;All versions are now given the version 3.0 label to indicate the level offunctionality.andM;Version 3.0 is reportedly faster than its predecessors, but otherwise doesnot add significant new features, aside from the few mentioned above.andM;AN of the 3.0 versions for PCs are priced at $895, regardless of theenvironment.andP;  The Mac version, however, is $795.andP;  This is a considerable cutfrom the unbundled price of all of the modules in the past.andM;Perhaps more important than the pricing, though, is Ventura's decision tosolidify all of its code into one product.andP;  After announcing that the threePc versions would be available by mid-1990, Gerhard set a goal for thecompany to establish a level playing ground for its Publisher software acrossall desktop platforms in 1990.andP;  All of the Ventura Publisher versions are tooffer identical functionality, regardlcss of their platform.andM;This strategic move will enable Xerox to keep all of its customers at thesame software level, which should help Ventura's support staff.andP;  It shouldalso help refine its marketing message  single solution, multiple platforms)and reduce the confusion regarding product development.andM;Ventura now appears close to meeting this goal.andP;  The status of the fouriterations of Ventura Publisher--now called version 3-is as follows:andM;* DOS Gem-shipped in june.andM;* Windows 3.0-shipped last week.andM;* Os/2-September 1990.andM;* Macintosh-planned shipments by the end of 1990.andM;As we reported in April, Xerox has also since bought out the original Venturafounders to gain complete control over the product.andP;  It has abandoned most ofits other desktop software products to focus specifically on VenturaPublisher.andP;  It now appears ready to grab aggressively an increasing share ofthe desktop publishing market.andM;The Sun portandM;Separately, Ventura announced last month that it is in the process of portingversion 3 of its Ventura Publisher software to Sun Microsystems workstations.andO;The Sun version will offer the same functionality as the Mac and Pc versionsthat are being completed this year.andP;  Ventura expects to complete the Sunversion in the latter half of 1991.andM;Announcing a product more than a year in advance of its introduction--andwell before it can be demonstrated to the public-sets a new record forpurposeful vaporware.andP;  Ventura asserts that its customers have been askingfor a single solution across all of their platforms.andP;  Apparently, one of theplatforms customers are asking for is Unix.andM;In the Unix market, Ventura may face stiff competition.andP;  Frame and Interleafhave offered their publishing software on all of the leading workstations forsome time, and both claim tens of thousands of users.andP;  Rather than wait untilits product is ready to show, Gerhard wanted to make a strategic statementthat would let potential customers know that Ventura intends to play in theUnix market.andM;How the Unix version will differ from Mac or Pc ones is not clear.andP;  Venturaannounced that the user interface for the product will be Sun's Open Look,but beyond that it was not able to make definitive product statements.andP;  Weexpect that it will support TCP/IP networks and will be faster onhigher-performance machines, but it's too early to comment in detail.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
