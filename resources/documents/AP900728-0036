There is no way thecommunity can absorb it,'' said Dade County Manager Joaquin Avino.More than 120,000 Cubans fled to Florida over a five-month periodin 1980.   Miami area leaders say they would need help in resettlingrefugees as well as federal controls on the numbers of visas toavoid another chaotic exodus.   ``One can hardly oppose the free emigration from Cuba of peoplewho are seeking freedom,'' said Miami's Cuban-born mayor, XavierSuarez.   ``We need the usual safeguards and guarantees so we wouldn't getpeople from jails. There should be a plan with people going toother parts of the country, and not all people into one community.''   Asylum-seekers packed the Peruvian Embassy in Havana in 1980,prompting the boatlift from the Cuban port of Mariel. A ragtagarmada of Cuban-Americans sailed across the Florida Straitsbelieving they were picking up relatives, friends and politicalprisoners, but some were forced to return with convicted criminalsand vagrants.   Today, most experts agree that fewer than 10 percent of the``Marielitos'' were criminals. About 2,600 are still in federalcustody, 173 were returned to Cuba and an estimated 4,000 are invarious state and local prisons.   In a speech Thursday on the 37th anniversary of the beginning ofthe Cuban revolution, Castro invited the United States and othernations to issue entrance visas and send boats to pick up refugees.   In a sarcastic tone, Castro dared ``the Yankees'' if ``they wantto receive these poor, persecuted citizens, let them send the boatsand the visas.''   Cuban exiles in Miami said they believed the speech was solelyintended to embarrass the United States.   ``Fidel knows that the U.S. is in no position to issue tens ofthousands of visas. What Castro is trying to tell Cubans is, `Ifyou want to leave then leave, but they don't want you there,'''said Tomas Regalado, news director at WAQF-AM, a Spanish-languageradio station.   Under a 1984 agreement for orderly emigration, Cubans wishing toleave for the United States can go to the U.S. diplomatic missionin Havana and apply for visas. Last year, 10,046 Cubans wereallowed to come here as immigrants, the Immigration andNaturalization Service said.   INS spokesman Verne Jervis said the agency has a contingencyplan for a Mariel-type refugee surge, and a change in the Cubanrefugee flow might require a revision of the plan.   ``But at the moment there is no reason to believe a boatliftsituation is imminent,'' he said.   Coast Guard spokesman Alastair Worden said there were no reportsFriday of Cuban-Americans launching vessels to the island.   So far this year, 216 Cuban refugees have been found this yearin boats and home-made vessels floating toward Florida, saidWorden. Last year, 390 Cubans were rescued by the Coast Guard.</TEXT></DOC>
