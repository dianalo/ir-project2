This study was therefore concernedwith just identifying and evaluating policy options that are feasiblewithin the socio-economic and political context of the Busan metropolitanarea and, in particular, how the criteria of efficiency and equity canbest be achieved by implementing transit policy alternatives. In theabsence of long-run major public investment in urban transportation,the criteria of both efficiency and equity can only be furthered throughmanagerial strategies applied within a systematic evaluative framework.By emphasizing the planning, operational, and managerial considerationsof fixed-route bus transit in Busan, it has been acknowledged that efficientand equitable public transportation can be provided through a varietyof social, economic, political, and institutional arrangements that arepossible to apply from a policy viewpoint in the immediate future.</TEXT></DOC>
