(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President-elect George Bush, afterpicking a ``take-charge kind of guy'' as his chief of staff, saidtoday he intends fill out his economic team and then turn tonational security posts.   Bush, here for a private meeting with several governors, toldreporters he planned to ``flesh out the economic side of the house,I think, and then start working on national security.''   Asked if that meant he was preparing to name Richard Darman, hislongtime economic aide, as director of the Office of Management andBudget, Bush laughed but said nothing.   After the morning meeting, Bush was flying back to Washington fora Capitol Hill lunch with the speaker of the House, Jim Wright.   As the day began, New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, publicly pickedby Bush Thursday as his next chief of staff, told a televisioninterviewer that the president-elect would communicate directly withCongress ``to begin the kind of interaction that's necessary'' toaddress the federal budget deficit.   ``I think Congress and the president are going to workaggressively and quickly to deal with that issue,'' Sununu said onABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''   Bush said his meeting with 18 governors and governors-elect wasintended ``to send an early signal to the governors and the statesof my interests in working with the governors, Democrats andRepublicans alike.''   He also said he wants to meet with the governors early to discussthe environment and education.   There was unusual turmoil in the Bush ranks Thursday when thepresient-elect announced his selection of Sununu as chief of staffand endorsed Lee Atwater, his wily campaign manager, as the nextchairman of the Republican Party.   Craig L. Fuller, Bush's vice presidential chief of staff for fouryears and co-director of the transition, called The Associated Pressbeforehand to reveal that having been passed over for chief ofstaff, he would quit working for Bush as of Jan. 20.   Fuller said he informed Bush before the election that the onlypost he would accept in the new administration was chief of staff.He said he harbored no ill will toward Sununu.   Sources close to Bush said Fuller had been offered several plums,including transportation secretary and head of the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration, but had turned them down.   In choosing the conservative, blunt-spoken Sununu and Atwater, abare-knuckled campaign strategist, Bush may have been indicating toDemocrats who control Congress that he is prepared to play politicalhardball.   But he sounded a different note at his news conference, saying heexpects Sununu ``to build a constructive relationship'' withCongress. He also called Sununu ``a take-charge kind of guy'' withthe experience to work with his former colleagues in the statehouses.   Bush, who previously announced his choice of James A. Baker IIIas secretary of state and Nicholas F. Brady as a holdover treasurysecretary, said he expects to announce a director for the Office ofManagement and Budget soon.   Transition sources have said that post is likely to go to Darman,while Stanford University economist Michael J. Boskin is likely tobe chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.   Bush has had to contend with a succession of economic bad newssince his election. The stock market has fallen and the dollar hasdeclined in value, with many analysts questioning Bush's ability orresolve to cut the nation's massive trade and budget deficits.   Bush aides hope fast action in naming his economic team willbolster confidence in the president-elect.   Brady, asked on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show if the behavior of stockprices and the dollar's value indicate a lack of confidence inBush's ability to overcome the deficit, replied, ``I just disagree.   ``The Bush deficit-reduction plan, which is called a flexiblefreeze, will work. I think we have to give the vice president alittle time to put his team together. I'm confident that things willwork out just fine.''   But Sununu, in his interview, said he feels that there is ``alittle bit of nervousness out there.''   Bush said the OMB job ``is important and I want to get oureconomic team in place. ... Most people would agree we've moved veryfast so far. But I will go forward with the economic team.''   Bush, who had a breakfast meeting Thursday with British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher and lunch with President Reagan, alsoheld a private chat with former Texas Sen. John Tower, who isrumored to be a leading candidate for secretary of defense.   Bush defended Sununu, an Arab-American, for his refusal to sign aproclamation two years ago condemning a 1975 United Nationsresolution that equated Zionism with racism. Sununu was the onlygovernor to balk at signing such a proclamation.   Bush said Sununu was ``well within his prerogative'' to not wantto meddle in foreign policy as a governor. ``Everybody knows myposition on it, that I think that (U.N.) resolution is outrageous''and should be repealed, Bush said. He also pointed to Sununu's rolein drafting the 1988 Republican platform, which called for arescission of that U.N. Resolution 3379.   Sununu told reporters, ``I have no problem saying that that(resolution) ought to be repudiated.''   Sununu, 49, is an engineer by training and a former TuftsUniversity professor, with no previous experience in Washington.Asked about his reputation for having a short fuse, Sununu joked,``I'm a pussycat.''   He said his main task will be to serve as ``an honest broker''and present Bush with ``as much information'' as possible about thedecisions he must make.   Sununu said today that ``if I can blend into the woodwork while(Bush) gets the visibility, that's the way it should be done.''   Bush said Atwater's job will be ``winning elections'' for the GOP.   ``He's No. 1 and he knows the party apparatus from top tobottom,'' said Bush. Atwater, 37, is certain to get the job Jan. 18when the Republican National Committee meets to choose a successorto Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., who is stepping down after six years.</TEXT></DOC>
