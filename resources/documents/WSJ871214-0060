There are already signs of dissension within the alliance over the course that arms-control negotiations should now take. Moreover, many Western politicians and diplomats fear that the public's euphoria over last week's treaty banning land-based, intermediate-range nuclear forces will make it more difficult for the West to take a tough stance in other negotiations.    Another worry is how NATO's 16 members will get the money to carry out plans to modernize Europe's remaining nuclear forces at a time when many voters and politicians believe a new era of arms reductions is at hand. The plans call for NATO to deploy an improved version of its remaining nuclear missile, the Lance, and invest more heavily in so-called dual-purpose aircraft-fighters and bombers that can carry nuclear bombs and missiles.    &quot;No one underestimates the continuing problem of gaining public support for nuclear defense,&quot; says Alton G. Keel Jr., the U.S. ambassador to NATO. &quot;It will be compounded by an era of fiscal austerity.&quot;    Growing strains within the alliance became apparent last week at the end of a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels. West Germany raised the touchy issue of what to do with the short-range nuclear missiles, bombs and artillery shells that will remain after the intermediate-range weapons are removed.    West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher pressed for the start of negotiations on short-range weapons, most of which are in his country. The move was rejected as most members approved a resolution confining NATO's immediate efforts to strategic arms talks, conventional arms control and a potential treaty banning chemical weapons.    While Mr. Genscher played down the disagreement after the closed session, Jean-Bernard Raimond, France's foreign minister, said the issue was an &quot;unavoidable&quot; problem that NATO will have to wrestle with &quot;for months and years.&quot; NATO, he said, should &quot;not go headlong for shorter-range talks&quot; because it could remove the West's remaining land-based nuclear deterrent.    In France, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac warned Europe not to succumb to divisive pressures in the wake of the superpower summit and nuclear-arms pact. He said that &quot;different priorities&quot; among allies in Western Europe about defense could have a &quot;centrifugal effect&quot; of pulling them apart. He pledged that France would respond to an attack on West Germany, perhaps with France's medium-range &quot;prestrategic&quot; nuclear weapons. &quot;There won't be a battle for Germany without a battle for France,&quot; he said.    Nevertheless, France's priorities are markedly different from those of West Germany. Above all, it wants to maintain its own independent nuclear force, which it knows would be politically nearly impossible if all other nuclear weapons were withdrawn from Europe. French officials favor 50% cuts in U.S. and Soviet strategic missiles, as that would make France's missiles that much more important, although not important enough to be included in any agreement, they reason.    The French are worried, however, because the summit didn't seem to address cuts in conventional and chemical weapons, which to them stand out even more starkly in the Soviet bloc's favor after the intermediate-forces agreement. The bigger the imbalance, and the smaller the U.S. role in Europe, the more France will be expected to defend West Germany, a task it doesn't want to perform alone.    According to its agenda, NATO's immediate goal is to support the U.S. in negotiating a strategic-arms limitation treaty involving ocean-spanning missiles and bombers. One potential breakthrough during last week's summit is a new possibility of including the submarine-launched cruise missile in such an accord.    Attaining a global treaty banning chemical weapons is NATO's second objective, but the obstacles are enormous. Chemical-weapons production facilities look exactly like small commercial chemical plants, making inspection difficult, if not impossible. Gerald Frost, director of London's Institute for European Defense and Strategic Studies, worries that the current euphoria could push the West into signing a chemical ban that would not prevent cheating. &quot;I feel that things are moving much too fast,&quot; he says.    The third NATO goal, finding a way to reduce conventional armaments, is the subject of elaborate studies in France and West Germany on how to reduce the offensive power of Warsaw Pact land forces. This would involve deep, lopsided cuts in tanks, combat helicopters, heavy artillery and such things as portable bridging equipment that permit an army to seize and hold territory.    Complex as the NATO agenda may be, there are signs that some of the details may have to give way to political momentum. Among the most ebullient participants at the NATO meeting was U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, who told reporters that the talks between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had made &quot;a tremendous amount of progress&quot; in the strategic arms-control area. &quot;You really can see the shape, now, of that treaty,&quot; he said. Mr. Shultz is touring capitals in northern Europe this week to explain the results of the summit.    In West Germany, the momentum appears to be on the side of Foreign Minister Genscher, an outspoken advocate of arms reduction. &quot;The big domestic winner from the summit is not {Chancellor Helmut} Kohl and not the opposition Social Democrats but Mr. Genscher,&quot; says Uwe Nerlich, a German expert on security issues. With public opinion now so strongly in favor of disarmament, Mr. Nerlich expects the new defense minister succeeding Manfred Woerner will either be an &quot;arms controller or too weak to be a counterweight to Genscher.&quot; Mr. Woerner, a Genscher adversary, Friday was named to succeed Lord Carrington as the general secretary of NATO.    While Mr. Genscher attempted to get NATO to bargain for equal levels with the Warsaw Pact in short-range nuclear missiles, other West German officials worry that a majority of their voters might support a Soviet proposal to remove all such weapons. &quot;The pressure to accept it would be so strong in Germany that I don't see how the government could resist,&quot; says Juergen Todenhoefer, a member of the West German parliament and a defense expert.    The enthusiasm is evidently building on the other side of the Berlin Wall. After meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in East Berlin, Warsaw Pact leaders approved a statement calling for the &quot;banning and scrapping of nuclear weapons,&quot; the end of nuclear testing and reductions in conventional forces.    &quot;Whoever is ahead should cut back,&quot; Wolfgang Meyer, a spokesman for the East German Foreign Ministry, told reporters. </TEXT></DOC>
