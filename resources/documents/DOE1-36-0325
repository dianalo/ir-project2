These terminations are calledoptrodes (optical electrodes), and a group of optrodes are presentlyunder development for the in-vivo and in-vitro identification and quantificationof species of interest to the clinician. The current development includespH, carbon dioxide, potassium, and anti-cancer drugs. 6 refs., 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
