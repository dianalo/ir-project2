The first part involved studyof the system which, when described by the ethylene-naphthalene phasediagram, is a region consisting of solid naphthalene dissolved in supercriticalethylene. Deuterium spin-lattice relaxation times, T{sub 1}s, of d{sub8}-naphthalene in this region were taken along an isotherm of 15{degree}Cand from ethylene pressures of 120 to 1000 bar. This isotherm, alongwith 30 and 45{degree}C isotherms taken earlier, completes our T{sub1} study of this system. In addition, we measured diffusion coefficientsof d{sub 8}-naphthalene at 45{degree}C from ethylene pressures of 300to 1000 bar. The second part of our study involved investigation of theliquid naphthalene-supercritical ethylene region of the phase diagram.</TEXT></DOC>
