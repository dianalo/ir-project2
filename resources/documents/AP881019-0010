The effort has become a race against time complicated by thewind, bitter cold and shifting ice. The young California graywhales early Tuesday were tired. At least one may have pneumonia.Their barnacle-encrusted snouts were worn raw from grating on thejagged ice surrounding their tiny breathing holes.   At Prudhoe Bay, some 200 miles to the southeast, an ArmyNational Guard Skycrane helicopter was rigged to hook onto a185-ton icebreaking hovercraft barge owned by VECO Inc. for thetricky journey across the desolate Arctic Ocean to reach the whales.   But late Tuesday, the trip was put on hold until Wednesdaymorning. The journey was delayed when the barge became stuck in theice, then for refueling before the barge was moved a short distancelate Tuesday.   Col. Tom Carroll of the Alaska Army National Guard, said thebarge was pulled from the dock but it moved slowly.   Mike Haller, a National Guard spokesman, said crews would workthrough the night to lighten the barge by removing fuel.   ``We're looking at seeing if it makes things a littlesmoother,'' he said. ``We'll go after it again at first lighttomorrow.''   The whales, whose length ranges from 24 to 30 feet, becametrapped nearly two weeks ago while migrating south to warmerwaters. They were hemmed in by new ice 18 miles northeast of thisInupiat Eskimo village. The whales are in shallow water only a fewhundred feet offshore.   The trip from Prudhoe Bay to Point Barrow is expected to take25-40 hours and crews must be careful, authorities said. If the towcable were to snap and wrap in the helicopter rotors it could bedisastrous.   President Reagan telephoned the commander of the operation tooffer his support, telling him that Americans' ``hearts are withyou and our prayers are also with you.''   ``I just wanted to tell you that everybody down here, theirhearts are with you and our prayers are also with you,'' Reagantold Carroll.   Marvin King, VECO chief of operations at Prudhoe Bay, said thebarge was ready to go Tuesday, but would not budge. Workers freedthe barge later Tuesday.   The helicopter cannot lift the barge, said Haller. The Skycranescan only lift about 22,500 pounds, but when the barge is on its aircushion, the aircraft will be towing only about 18,000 pounds, hesaid.   The barge pulverizes ice with a combination of its weight andthe vibration from its engines.   The effort had been scheduled to begin Monday, but was delayedwhen it was discovered the barge needed repairs.   A National Weather Service analysis of the ice in the PointBarrow area Monday provided little hope for the animals.   A satellite photo shows the nearest open water is 200 miles tothe west, in the Chukchi Sea, he said. The next ice analysis wasscheduled for Wednesday.   Last week, the ice around the whales' breathing holes was sothin that biologists did not dare walk on it. By early Tuesday, theice was 18-24 inches thick. The California gray whales, despitetheir size and mass, have shown no inclination to bull their waythrough the ice pack.   Haller said authorities were aware of the analysis but weregoing ahead with the attempt. ``We're committed to this,'' Hallersaid. ``We're going to go ahead and see what happens.''   As the world watched and waited, biologists and North Sloperesidents worked with chainsaws to keep the whales' small breathingholes open. One of the holes is 24-by-20 feet; the other, 24-by-10.   Biologists said they were overwhelmed by the interest shown inthe trapped whales. The drama has prompted scores of calls frompeople with ideas to free the animals. They ranged from usingexplosives or dropping bowling balls to break the ice to nettingthe animals for transport elsewhere.   ``Every year, probably dozens of grays drown or are crushed bythe ice, but nobody ever knows about it,'' said North Slopebiologist Craig George.   To underscore his point, 20 miles offshore, the flipper of abowhead whale is frozen in the ice and has attracted more than ahalf-dozen foraging polar bears. Biologists said they weresurprised the bears had not found the stranded gray whales. Thescientists have begun carrying shotguns onto the ice, just in casethe bears get lucky.   Nobody was sure how long the whales could last. They have beenswimming against a current since they were trapped. Exhaustioncould kill them, but food is not a likely problem, biologists said.   The gray whales feed on the bottom, stirring up organisms thatthey filter through finger-like projections called baleen. ``Theseguys are kind of the vacuum cleaners of the whale family,'' Georgesaid. ``But all members of the great whale family have the abilityto fast for long periods.''   He said the whales had just completed their summer feedingperiod and should have started their ordeal in peak condition. Graywhales usually do not feed much as they migrate south, he said.   The whales were spotted because they were trapped relativelyclose to shore and biologists stationed in the area were alerted.   The population of endangered California gray whales numbersabout 20,000 and has been growing at an annual average of 2.5percent for the past decade, authorities said.   The whales spend their winters in the warm waters off Mexico andSouthern California.</TEXT></DOC>
