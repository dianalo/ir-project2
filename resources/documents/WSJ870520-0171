Someone stand up and take charge! There is definitely a problem and the airline industry is just playing with people's lives.    More than a year and half ago I tried to raise the issue of airline safety. In fact, Congress reacted with hearings and there was a short public outcry. But once again we have slipped into complacency and the safety of the public is at stake.    I ask: What will it take, another disaster like Delta Flight 191 in which my wife died? I know the personal anguish and outrage an airline crash can cause. Let's stop arguing and blaming each other.    First, the whole airline community should sit down and realize we have a problem and accept the fact that everyone has to work together to fix it. Second, attack the problem, remembering that we are dealing with people's lives. Third, implement a bold, new safety plan that will increase the level of flying safety.    I urge everyone in the airline community to sit down and get on with it. No one else should suffer like I am.    Brian Sulmonetti   Boca Raton, Fla.</TEXT></DOC>
