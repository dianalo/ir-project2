The aphorism that a prosecutor can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich certainly held here. Is this all there is? After spending 14 months and more than $4 million, there is nothing that wasn't discussed ad nauseam this summer before a red-faced congressional committee abruptly halted its hearings.    The main charge is &quot;conspiracy to defraud the U.S.&quot; Let's take a poll: Do you feel more defrauded by Ollie North, or by Congress and this special prosecutor? Mr. Walsh assured that he wasn't charging anyone with violating the vague Boland amendments. Yet the &quot;defraud&quot; charges depend on the claim that these amendments prohibited help for the Contras by National Security Council staffers. The defense lawyers will have a high old time citing the legislative history and the constitutional prerogatives of the executive branch in foreign policy to show that the Bolands didn't apply.    He also charged the foursome with &quot;embezzling, stealing and converting&quot; government property when they sent profits from the Iran arms sales to help the Contras. The idea was to have the U.S. sell weapons to intermediaries -- Israel and Mr. Secord's &quot;commercial cutout&quot; -- who then sold them at a markup to the Iranians. Mr. Walsh says the U.S. was entitled to the profit on the resale. The defendants might want to ask the commander in chief for a deposition on this issue. On Wednesday, President Reagan denied any laws were broken, that &quot;all I know was that we got the purchase price we asked for.&quot;    Then there are the really junk charges -- down to &quot;wire fraud.&quot; Lt. Col. North and Mr. Poindexter are charged with obstruction of justice; but files were gone before any criminal investigation began. Lt. Col. North is charged with conspiring to violate the tax laws by using a charity to raise money for the Contras; the IRS and Justice say this was no crime. Mr. Walsh says Lt. Col. North took $4,300 in traveler's checks; he testified that this was to reimburse him for operational bills he paid from his own pocket. About all that's left is the $13,000 security system Mr. Secord installed to protect the North home from Abu Nidal terrorists but that Mr. Walsh dismisses as an illegal &quot;gratuity.&quot;    To compound the frivolousness of the charges, at no point does Mr. Walsh even try to prove mens rea, the evil-intent requirement for any crime. Each of the accused testified that he believed his actions were authorized by the President. Does loyal service now establish venality?    Mr. Walsh now must turn to his own defense. The Supreme Court will decide whether to uphold Judge Laurence Silberman's invalidation of independent counsels on grounds they are loose cannons. If it does, Mr. Walsh probably will have to go home. He didn't accept an appointment inside Justice until months into his investigation, which taints the whole enterprise. Then there is the problem of the immunity Congress granted several witnesses. Mr. Walsh will try to prove he got the evidence independently, a notoriously difficult task.    Any trial soon would become high comedy. Brendan Sullivan, no potted plant, would hale Edward Boland and Jim Wright to the stand to explain their view of the Boland amendments. President Reagan could be called for rebuttal. The Marine Corps would have to explain why a private citizen had to put up the fence at the North home. Somehow, we doubt this ever will go to trial.    These charges should help clarify what this entire Iran-Contra investigation has been all about -- politics. David Jacobsen, one of the released hostages, put it most clearly yesterday when he said how angry he is that Ollie North &quot;is being held hostage by a foreign policy dispute between the President and Congress.&quot;    The investigation is over and produced nothing new. President Reagan has the chance to do the right thing by these accused while also making sure future Presidents don't have to put up with a Congress criminalizing policy differences. These four shouldn't have to beg President Reagan for his pardon. </TEXT></DOC>
