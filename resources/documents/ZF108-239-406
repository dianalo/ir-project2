Strathclyde sees demographyand technological opportunities as the other challenges.andP;  He believes thatnew technology can increase productivity and competitiveness, and offer moreflexible employment.andP;  However, he stresses that there are no short cuts to ahighly competent workforce.andP;  It can only be achieved through education andtraining.andP;  New technology, says Strathclyde, offers flexible approaches totraining that will create a highly skilled workforce for tomorrow.andP;  All ofwhich was being said shortly after the Great Exhibition in 1851, byeducational reformers such as Huxley at the turn of the century, and aconstant theme-song of governments throughout the twentieth century.andO;Strathclyde rightly commended IBM on its training intiatives, but concludedby reminding all present that it is the consumer we answer to in the end.andM;Datapoint submits to Metropole exile to declareandM;war on IBM over System/36 user baseandM;Consumer choice has undoubtedly loomed large in the IBM mind of late,specifically in the guise of a company called Datapoint Corp. It is one of asheaf of companies that weren't allowed to exhibit at IBM'90, but it decidedto set up shop next door at the Birmingham Metropole.andP;  According to RodneyBarnes, Datapoint UK's general manager of marketing, he received nothing inwriting from IBM, but was told that the companies' interests seemed to becompetitive, and Datapoint wouldn't be welcome at the largest IBM user show.andO;To be fair, that's perfectly understandable since Datapoint is targeting atleast 10% of IBM's System 36 replacement market with its Vista 36 offering(CI No 1,369).andP;  The company says that of 300 System 36 users surveyed, 40%would consider alternatives to IBM when they need to upgrade, and accordingto Dataquest, there are 6,000 users in the UK.andP;  The company claims that Vista36 can provide six times the performance of a System 36 for 60% the cost ofan AS/400.andP;  Datapoint says that the five year cost of an IBM System 36 for 16usersuser system with two 400Mb tape streamers and 12Mb of memory is #89,880.andO;That's #74,900 for the system, plus #14,980 for five years' maintenance.andP;  TheDatapoint offering, including 16 8088-based mono stations is #47,278, plusfive years of software and hardware maintenance at #17,712, total #64,990,37% less on the initial price, and 27.5% over five years.andP;  The system usesCalifornia Software's Baby 36 software which replicates the System 36environment, and runs on Datapoint's 80386-based DP7800 machines,manufactured in San Antonio, Texas.andP;  Network servers support between 15 and200 users, and additional features include support for MS-DOS, Oracle, Unix,SNA or OSI communications, electronic mail, and telex.andP;  The components arenetworked on the Arcnet local area network, and information exchange ishandled by the NetBIOS-compatible Datalan.andP;  Datapoint says that the increasein performance is obtained by shifting the application programming executionto individual workstations, and by using the central processor for fileaccess, security, and overall management.andP;  The network can grow either byadding new processor boards, by adding network processors, or by adding moredisks.andP;  New applications can be developed in C, Cobol, or SQL using Oracle'srelational database.andP;  Datapoint denies that Vista 36 is a one-offopportunistic attempt to capitalise on a temporary gap in the market.andP;  Thecompany has been active in local area networks and mid-range computer systemsfor over 20 years.andP;  Its other activities include automatic call distributionand distributed data processing.andP;  A $300m company, Datapoint has subsidiariesand a distributor network across Europe and the Middle East.andP;  The UKcontributes $55m to worldwide turnover, and Europe constitutes 70%.andP;  AsherEdelman, he of Storehouse notoriety, is chairman, and holds between 11% and13% of Datapoint's shares.andP;  The president is Michael Michigami, formerly withUnited Technology Computers.andP;  Datapoint forecasts that 50% of Vista 36 saleswill be via value-added resellers, and the company has signed up GlynwedInternational Group as its first.andP;  The initial system is to be installed atGlynwed Metal Services in Walsall.andP;  Rather ironically, Glynwed Computing Ltd,also part of Glynwed International, was exhibiting at IBM'90.andP;  It distributesIBM's AIX offerings, including the new RS/6000 range when it's available.andP;  -andO;Janice McGinn</TEXT></DOC>
