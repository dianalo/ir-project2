The upward turn in the Index of Leading Economic Indicatorsallowed the index to steer clear of the traditional signal of aforthcoming recession _ three declines in a row.   The index, designed to foretell economic activity six to ninemonths into the future, had dropped a revised 0.6 percent in Marchand 0.3 percent in February.   Analysts said April's upturn, which had been widely anticipated,was consistent with the view that while the economy is slowing,there still is enough strength left to power the record peacetimeexpansion through its seventh year.   ``It wasn't a good bet, it isn't a good bet and it's not goingto be a good bet in the fall that a recession is about to occur,''economist James Annable of First National Bank of Chicago said inanticipation of today's report.   Last month's increase in the index was the biggest rise since asimilar 0.8 percent jump in January.   Using the three-month rule of thumb for predicting recessions,the index has correctly forecast all eight economic downturns thathave occured since 1948, but it also has flashed false recessionsignals on five other occasions.   Most recently, the index declined five times in a row in themonths surrounding the October 1987 stock market crash, from whichthe economy emerged unscathed.   In April, eight of the 11 forward-looking business statisticsthat make up the composite index pointed upward, led by an increasein manufacturers' orders for consumer goods.   Other indicators making positive contributions were: risingbuilding permits; a longer average work week; higher stock prices;a decrease in initial claims for jobless benefits; slower vendordeliveries, signaling stronger demand; a gain in orders for newplants and equipment; and an increase in manufacturers' unfilledorders.   Three indicators pointed downward: a drop in an index measuringconsumer confidence; a contraction in the money supply; and fallingprices for sensitive materials, indicating slower demand.   The various changes left the index at 145.7 percent of its 1982base of 100. The index has advanced 1.3 percent over the past sixmonths, compared with a 1.7 percent increase over the previoussix-month period.   Annable said recent reports on the economy's performanceindicate that growth will slow to a more sustainable level and``suggest this economy is in better shape for growth than even weoptimists thought.''   Pessimists, too, are rethinking their views.   Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. inChicago, has been forecasting a mild recession by year's end butnow concedes ``the odds are by no means convincing, even to me.''   ``The evidence is coming in the side of a soft landing _continued but subdued growth,'' Dederick said.   That is just what the Federal Reserve has been trying toproduce. In March 1988, the central bank began pushing up interestrates in an effort to slow growth just enough to restrain inflationwithout toppling the country into a recession.   Dederick said an upturn in the index ``doesn't mean that weshould be looking for the economy to go roaring off but it doesweaken the case that the slowdown is going to develop intorecession proportions.''   The government reported last week that the economy expanded at amoderate 4.3 percent annual rate during the first three months ofthe year, but the growth in the gross national product was alackluster 1.8 percent when a statistical bounceback from lastyear's drought is removed.   That compares with GNP growth of 3.9 percent for all of 1988.   Still, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the latest GNPreport indicates that ``Fed policy over the past year appears to besucceeding in steering the economy to a more moderate, butsustainable, growth path.''   Irwin Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover TrustCo. in New York said that even with an upturn in the leading index,``the economy is still pretty weak.''   A rebound in the index ``doesn't take away from the notion thatthe economy is slowing down, but it does not imply a recession anytime soon,'' Kellner said in advance of today's report.</TEXT></DOC>
