Because stock trading no longer takes place on the exchange'sfloor but is now done via telephones and computers, the morningexplosion in a restroom near the exchange-floor viewing gallerydidn't disrupt business at the Stock Exchange's modern tower in theheart of the City of London.   ``If the purpose of this callous act was to bring the City(financial district) to a halt, they have failed singularly,'' saidAndrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange. ``Our systemsand services have functioned perfectly, and trading has continuedas normal.''   Like other recent bombing incidents in Britain, this blast waslinked to the Irish Republican Army's campaign against British rulein Northern Ireland.   Earlier attacks have been largely directed at police, army andgovernment targets. The IRA, however, espouses a socialist futurefor a united Ireland, and stock exchanges are considered an obvioustarget for foes of capitalism.   Exchanges employ entrance guards, bouncers and metal detactorsto protect themselves from attack.   Despite the explosion, prices rose. The Financial Times-StockExchange 100-share index was up 12.8 points, or 0.5 percent, at2,400.1 at the close. Trading was active.   Options trading was disrupted for the day, however. Although theexchange building is now largely deserted, the ground-level tradingfloor still houses the London Traded Options Market. Options arethe right to buy or sell shares at a fixed price before a specificdate.   Since Britain's huge deregulation nearly four years ago _ knownas the Big Bang _ traders no longer physically congregate in oneplace. Rather, designated investment firms make markets indifferent stocks and bonds via an electronic market run withcomputers.   The exchange requires the 25 equities market makers to quoteprices continuously through the official trading day, which runsfrom 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. London time. Trading also is allowed totake place outside official hours.   The market makers' prices appear on the exchange's computerizedprice quotations system, SEAQ International, which buyers andsellers can view on video display terminals.   On the New York and Tokyo stock exchanges, trading physicallytakes place on the floor, conducted by market makers known asspecialists.   The London market is Europe's biggest and forms part of theso-called ``Golden Triangle'' with New York and Tokyo.   There are more than 2,500 British and overseas companies listedon London's Stock Exchange. Average daily trading in domesticstocks is worth about $1.5 billion.   Formally called the International Stock Exchange of the UnitedKingdom and the Republic of Ireland Ltd., it employs nearly 2,600people who develop trading rules, list companies, recordtransactions and operate information systems.   The tower, one of 14 buildings the exchange occupies, opened in1973. Located in Broad Street, it is next to the Bank of Englandand across from the grand, columned Royal Exchange, which housesthe London International Financial Futures Exchange.   The London exchange has been studying what it should do with allits empty floor space. The options market plans to move out.</TEXT></DOC>
