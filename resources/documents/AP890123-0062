The court, without comment, rejected arguments by state officialsthat the protective-custody inmates were not entitled to the sameprograms, services and living conditions as inmates in the generalprison population.   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last July that theunequal treatment afforded those in protective custody violatedconstitutional rights.   ``Bad prisons are not inevitable,'' the appeals court said inrejecting arguments by officials that they were protecting securityat Stateville.   The appeals court also ordered further trial hearings todetermine what damages the protective-custody inmates are owed.   Illinois officials ``have failed to convince us that the cutbackof essential programs and services for protective-custody inmates atStateville has a legitimate rational basis,'' the appeals court said.   It noted that the inmates were segregated from the general prisonpopulation at the maximum-security institution to protect them, notto punish them.   The protective-custody inmates were not allowed to take part incommunal worship services or classroom religious instruction; theiraccess to the library was strictly limited; vocational andeducational programs designed to rehabilitate prisoners were notavailable to them; they said their food was inferior and they had toeat all meals in their cells; and they were allowed only 75 minutesof dayroom or yard recreation every other day.   The appeals court said those inmates suffered inferior treatmentbecause prison officials had no desire to make improvements.   The 7th Circuit court also upheld the appointment of a specialmaster to oversee improvements ordered by a federal trial judge.   Appointment of a master is appropriate because of the many``instances of administrative recalcitrance,'' the appeals courtsaid.   Officials from Kansas and Indiana joined in urging the justicesto throw out the 7th Circuit court ruling   The case is Lane vs. Williams, 88-899.</TEXT></DOC>
