<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-76-0680 </DOCNO><TEXT>A system for controlling the ignition timing of an internal combustionengine having a microprocessor and an ignition timing control deviceis described comprising: first sensing means for sensing operating conditionsof the engine at steady state and for producing an engine operating conditionsignal; second sensing means for sensing the acceleration of the engineand for producing an acceleration signal; a knock sensor for sensingengine knock and for producing a knock signal; first means responsiveto the engine operating condition signal and knock signal for producinga first ignition timing correcting signal representing an ignition timingcorrecting quantity at a time for deciding the ignition timing and forproducing a basic ignition timing based on the first ignition timingcorrecting signal; and second means responsive to the acceleration signaland the knock signal for obtaining from a table a second ignition timingcorrecting signal representing an ignition timing correcting quantityfor correcting the basic ignition timing decided by the first ignitiontiming correcting signal.</TEXT></DOC>
