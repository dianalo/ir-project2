On September 5, 1989, we presented a questionnaireto the Government of Thailand (GOT) in Washington, DC, concerning petitioner'sallegations. On October 11, 1989, after granting an extension, we receivedresponses from the GOT and from the three respondent companies, Awaji SangyoCo., Ltd. (AST), Thai Benkan Co., Ltd. (TBC), and TTU Industrial Corp.,Ltd. (TTU). On October 19, 1989, we issued a supplemental/deficiency questionnaireto the GOT and the respondent companies, and received responses on October25, 1989. We issued an additional questionnaire to the respondent companieson October 25, 1989, for which responses are due November 1, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the HarmonizedTariff Schedule (HTS), and all merchandise entered or withdrawn from warehousefor consumption on or after that date is now classified solely accordingto the appropriate HTS item number. The Department is providing both theappropriate Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA) itemnumber and the appropriate HTS item number with its product descriptionsfor convenience and Customs purposes. The Department's written descriptionof the product under investigation remains dispositive as to the scopeof the products covered by this investigation.The product covered by this investigation is carbon steel butt-weld pipefittings, having an inside diameter of less than 360 millimeters (fourteeninches), imported in either finished or unfinished form. These formed orforged pipe fittings are used to join sections in piping systems whereconditions require permanent, welded connections, as distinguished fromfittings based on other fastening methods (<T3>e.g.,</T3> threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). The product is classifiedunder HTS subheading 7307.93.30 and was formerly classifiable under TSUSAitem 610.88.00.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG>Consistent with our practice in preliminary determinations, when a responseto an allegation denies the existence of a program, receipt of benefitsunder a program, or eligibility of a company or industry under a program,and the Department has no persuasive evidence showing that the responseis incorrect, we accept the response for purposes of the preliminary determination.All such responses, however, are subject to verification. If the responsecannot be supported at verification, and the program is otherwise countervailable,the program will be considered a bounty or grant in the final determination.For purposes of this preliminary determination, the period for which weare measuring bounties or grants (``the review period'') is calendar year1988, which corresponds to the fiscal year of all three respondent companies.Based upon our analysis of the petition and the responses to our questionnaires,we preliminarily determine the following:I. Programs Preliminarily Determined To Confer Bounties or GrantsWe preliminarily determine that bounties or grants are being provided tomanufacturers, producers, or exporters in Thailand of pipe fittings underthe following programs:<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Short-Term Loans Provided Under the Export Packing Credits Program</ITAG>Export packing credits (EPCs) are short-term loans used for either pre-shipmentor post-shipment financing. Exporters apply to commercial banks for EPCs.The commercial banks, in turn, must submit an application for approvalto the Bank of Thailand (BOT). Under the ``Regulations Governing the Purchaseof Promissory Notes Arising from Exports'' (B. E. 2528), effective January2, 1986, the BOT repurchases promissory notes issued by creditworthy exportersthrough commercial banks. To qualify for the repurchase arrangement, promissorynotes must be supported by a letter of credit, sales contract, purchaseorder, usance bill or warehouse receipt. The notes are available for upto 180 days, and interest is paid on the due date of the loan rather thanthe date of receipt.The BOT charges an interest rate of five percent per annum to commercialbanks on repurchased packing credits issued in connection with exportsof goods specified in categories one and two of the ``Notification of theBoard of Investment No. 40/2521.'' The commercial banks are permitted tocharge exporters no more than seven percent per annum for the purchaseof such notes.On the due date of the loan, the BOT debits the commercial bank's accountfor the principal amount and the interest charged the commercial bank.If the terms of the loan are not met, the BOT charges the commercial banka penalty, retroactive to the first day of the loan.Similarly, on the due date of the loan, the commercial bank debits theexporter's account for the principal amount and the maximum of seven percentinterest charged the exporter. If the exporter has not met the terms ofthe loan, the commercial bank passes on the penalty charge over the termof the loan.The penalty is refunded to the commercial bank by the BOT and by the commercialbank to the exporter if the company can prove shipment of the goods tookplace within 60 days after the due date (in the case of pre-shipment loans),or the foreign currency was received within 60 days after the due date(in the case of post-shipment loans). Otherwise, the penalty is not refunded.The purpose of the penalty charge is to ensure that companies take outEPC loans only to finance actual export sales.On October 1, 1988, the GOT issued new regulations that coexisted withthe prior regulations until December 31, 1988. On January 1, 1989, thenew regulations completely replaced the former ones. Until January 1, 1989,exporters could still receive EPC loans under the terms of the programdescribed above. Under the new regulations, the maximum rate commercialbanks can charge exporters was raised from seven to ten percent. In addition,the BOT now rediscounts only up to 50 percent of the loan amount, whereasunder the previous program the BOT could rediscount the full value of theloan.According to the responses, TBC and TTU received EPC loans on which interestwas paid during the review period. Because only exporters are eligiblefor these loans, we determine that they are countervailable to the extentthat they are provided at preferential rates.As the benchmark for short-term loans, it is our practice to use the predominantform of short-term financing or a national average commercial interestrate. In the absence of a predominant form of short-term financing in theThai economy, we are using the weighted-average interest rate charged bycommercial banks on domestic loans, bills and overdrafts during 1988, and,where loans were issued in 1987, the weighted-average interest rate ofthe same composition for 1987. This is the benchmark that we have appliedin all previous Thai cases, most recently in Final Affirmative CountervailingDuty Determination and Partial Countervailing Duty Order: Ball Bearingsand Parts Thereof from Thailand; Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determinations:Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Ball or Tapered Roller Bearings) andParts Thereof from Thailand, (54 FR 19130, May 3, 1989) (Bearings).Comparing the weighted-average interest rates for 1987 and 1988, as reportedin the GOT response, to the rate charged on EPCs, as reported in the companyresponses, we find that the rate on EPCs is preferential and, therefore,confers a bounty or grant on exports of pipe fittings.To calculate the benefit from the EPC loans on which interest was paidduring the review period, we followed the short-term loan methodology whichhas been applied consistently in our past determinations (see, for example,Bearings) and which is described in more detail in the Subsidies Appendixattached to the notice of Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat-Rolled Productsfrom Argentina: Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination andCountervailing Duty Order (49 FR 18006, April 26, 1984); see also, <T3>Alhambra Foundry </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>626 F. Supp. 402 (CIT, 1985).We compared the amount of interest actually paid during the review periodto the amount that would have been paid at the benchmark rate. Becausethe responses specified which EPC loans were tied to exports to the UnitedStates, we calculated the amount of interest that would have been paidon such loans at the benchmark rate and subtracted the amount of interestthat was actually paid. We then divided the result by the respondents'exports to the United States during the review period to obtain an estimatednet bounty or grant of 0.14 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3>.TTU has argued that, in addition to subtracting the interest actually paidfrom the interest that would have been paid at the benchmark rate, we shouldalso subtract an interest cost to the company associated with penalty paymentswhich were subsequently refunded. TTU argues that because it had to foregouse of these funds, the company had to borrow money and, therefore, incurredincreased financing costs. TTU has calculated the increase in its financingcosts by using the national average benchmark described above. We are notsubtracting the cost due to subsequently refunded penalty payments forpurposes of our preliminary determination because we are not convincedthat TTU's calculation is appropriate. We are seeking more informationand will continue to examine this issue for purposes of our final determination.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Tax Certificates for Exports</ITAG>The GOT issues to exporters tax certificates which are freely transferableand which constitute a rebate of indirect taxes and import duties usedto produce exports. This rebate program is provided for in the ``Tax andDuty Compensation of Exported Goods Produced in the Kingdom Act'' (Taxand Duty Act). The rebate rates under the Tax and Duty Act are computedon the basis of an Input/Output (I/O) study published in 1980, based on1975 data, and updated in 1985 using 1980 data.Using the I/O study, the Thai Ministry of Finance computes the value oftotal inputs (both imports and local purchases) used in a discrete rangeof sector-specific products at ex-factory prices. It also calculates theimport duties and indirect taxes on each input. The Ministry then calculatestwo rebate rates. The ``A'' rate includes both import duties and indirecttaxes. The ``B'' rate includes only indirect domestic taxes. The ``B''rate is claimed when firms participate in Thailand's customs duty drawbackprogram or duty exemption program on imported raw materials, or when firmsdo not use imported materials in their production process. New rebate rates,announced on February 5, 1986, were computed using the study publishedin 1985. Since 1986, the ``A'' rate applicable to exports of pipe fittingshas been 8.11 percent and the ``B'' rate has been 4.98 percent. The ``A''or ``B'' rate, as appropriate, is then applied to the FOB value of theexport to determine the amount of rebate that will be provided.Under the Tax and Duty Act, the rebates are paid to companies through taxcertificates which can be used to pay other tax liabilities. These taxcertificates can also be transferred to other companies which can use themto pay their tax liabilities.According to the responses, only TTU actually received tax certificatesduring the review period.However, all three respondent companies earned the ``B'' rate on exportsmade during the review period. Therefore, we have preliminarily determinedthat each company used this program during the review period. We also preliminarilydetermine that, because this program is available only to exporters, itis countervailable to the extent that it confers an overrebate of indirecttaxes.To determine whether an indirect tax rebate system confers an overrebateand, therefore a bounty or grant, we must apply the following analysis.First, we examine whether the system is intended to operate as a rebateof both indirect taxes and import duties. Next, we analyze whether thegovernment properly ascertained the level of the rebate. This includesa review of a sample from the I/O study used by the Government to quantifythe rebate. We analyze the documentation supporting the study to determinethe accuracy of the sample on input coefficients, the import prices andrates of duty on imported inputs, the ratio of imported inputs to domesticallyproduced inputs (when, for a given imported input, there is also domesticproduction of the input), and the exchange rates used to convert importprices denominated in a foreign currency to the local currency. Finally,we review whether the rebate schedules are revised periodically in orderto determine whether the rebate amount reasonably reflects the amount ofduty and indirect taxes paid.When the study upon which the indirect tax and import duty rebate systemis based is shown to bear a reasonable relation to the actual indirecttax rebate incidence, the Department will consider that the system doesnot confer a bounty or grant unless the amount rebated for duties and indirecttaxes on physically incorporated inputs exceeds the fixed amount set forthin the rebate schedule for the exported product. When the system rebatesduties and indirect taxes on both physically incorpated and non-physicallyincorporated inputs, we find a bounty or grant exists to the extent thatthe fixed rebate exceeds the allowable rebate on physically incorporatedinputs.In the Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and CountervailingDuty Order: Certain Apparel from Thailand (50 FR 9818, 9820, March 12,1985), we examined Thailand's rebate system under the Tax and Duty Act.We found that the program was intended to rebate indirect taxes and importduties and that the rebate rates had been reasonably calculated. However,to the extent that the program rebates indirect taxes and import dutieson non-physically incorporated inputs, we found that the remissions areexcessive. In subsequent investigations involving products from Thailand,the most recent of which was Bearings, we undertook the analysis describedabove and reiterated that these rebates are countervailable only to theextent that the remissions are excessive. In the present investigation,we will verify whether rebates under this program continue to reasonablyreflect the incidence of indirect taxes and import duties on inputs.For purposes of our preliminary determination, to determine whether, andthe extent to which, the tax certificates confer an excessive remissionof indirect taxes, we calculated the indirect taxes and import duties paidon physically incorporated inputs according to the most recent I/O table.We divided the tax incidence on all items physically incorporated intoall products classified in the secondary steel products sector, which includescarbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings, by the value of all domesticallyproduced finished goods in this sector. Given that the aggregated dataused in the I/O study is broken down only by sector, and that each sectorcovers many individual products, it is impossible to isolate the valueof domestically produced pipe fittings.Although the methodology described above is a deviation from that usedin previous investigations involving products from Thailand (see, for example,Bearings), we believe that it more accurately reflects the amount of allowablerebate. Furthermore, unlike previous investigations in which respondentseither failed to provide a comprehensive list of all items physically incorporatedinto the sector, or failed to provide such information prior to verification,respondents in the present investigation have provided the necessary informationin a timely manner.We recognize that, by using the tax incidence on all physically incorporatedinputs into secondary steel products, we may be including the tax incidenceon inputs used in the production of pipe fittings but not physically incorporatedinto pipe fittings. We have determined, however, that for purposes of thispreliminary determination the inclusion of this tax incidence providesthe most accurate measure of the allowable rebate percentage for secondarysteel products and, as such, the most reasonable calculation of the allowablepercentage for pipe fittings. However, because this is a significant changein methodology with respect to this program, we will continue to examinethis issue for purposes of our final determination.The value of all domestically produced finished goods, as shown in theI/O tables, is an ex-factory value. However, because the rebate is appliedto the FOB value of a company's exports, we had to adjust the ex-factoryvalue to reflect an FOB value. We did this by dividing the wholesale marginand transportation costs for all domestically produced finished goods inthe sector, including exports, by the ex-factory value and then multiplyingthe ex-factory value by this ratio. We added the result to the ex-factoryvalue in order to obtain the FOB-adjusted value.In order to obtain the allowable rebate rate, we divided the tax incidenceon all items physically incorporated into secondary steel sector productsby the FOB-adjusted value of all domestically produced finished goods inthe secondary steel sector. We then compared the authorized rebate rateof 4.98 percent, which is based on both physically and non-physically incorporatedinputs, to the allowable rebate rate and found that there is an excessiveremission of indirect taxes to exporters of pipe fittings. The differencebetween the two rebate rates equals the net overrebate. On this basis,we calculated an estimated net bounty or grant of 0.94 <T3>ad valorem.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">C. Tax and Duty Exemptions Under Section 28 of the Investment PromotionAct</ITAG>The Investment Promotion Act (IPA) of 1977 provides incentives for investmentto promote development of the Thai economy. Administered by the Board ofInvestment, the IPA authorizes, among other incentives, the exemption ofimport duties and certain taxes with respect to qualifying projects. Section28 provides for exemption from payment of import duties and business taxeson machinery. All three respondent companies received exemptions undersection 28 that became effective during the review period. According tothe responses, all three respondent companies are required to export acertain percentage of their output as a condition for receipt of benefitsunder this program.Because benefits to the respondent companies under this program are contingentupon their export performance, we preliminarily determine that it is countervailable.We divided the total amount of exemptions received by respondents duringthe review period by the respondents' total export sales during the reviewperiod. On this basis, we calculated an estimated net bounty or grant of1.77 <T3>ad valorem.</T3>II. Programs Preliminarily Determined Not to Confer Bounties or GrantsWe preliminarily determine that bounties or grants are not being providedto manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Thailand of pipe fittingsunder the following program:<ITAG tagnum="81">IPA Section 36(1)</ITAG>Section 36(1) of the IPA authorizes exemptions from import duties and businesstaxes on ``raw and necessary materials.'' All three respondent companiesreceived exemptions under this section of the IPA during the review period.According to the responses, all exemptions were received for items physicallyincorporated into exported goods.III. Programs Preliminarily Determined Not To Be UsedWe preliminarily determine that the following programs were not used bymanufacturers, producers, or exporters in Thailand of pipe fittings duringthe review period:<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Electricity Discounts for Exporters</ITAG>The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, the Metropolitan ElectricityAuthority, and the Provincial Electricity Authority provide discounts onelectricity rates charged to producers of export products. According tothe responses, this program provides discounts of 20 percent of the costof electricity consumed to produce exports. Any producer that consumeselectricity in manufacturing products that are eligible to receive taxcertificates for exports is eligible for the electricity discount. Oncea producer has qualified for the electricity discount and has completedan export transaction involving eligible products, it may apply to theelectricity authority from which it receives its electricity bill. Theauthority then calculates the amount of the discount and credits a deductionon a subsequent electricity bill. According to the responses, none of therespondents received benefits under this program during the review period.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Rediscount of Industrial Bills</ITAG>The BOT authorizes rediscounts for short-term promissory notes arisingfrom industrial activity. The BOT's ``Regulations Governing the Rediscountof Promissory Notes Arising from Industrial Undertakings'' permit commercialbanks to rediscount short-term promissory notes for industrial purchases.Commercial banks may charge their industrial customers a maximum of sevenpercent per annum, while the rate charged to commercial banks by the BOTis five percent per annum. According to the responses, none of the respondentsparticipated in this program during the review period.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. International Trade Promotion Fund</ITAG>This fund is used to finance export promotion activities, such as marketingresearch and trade fairs. According to the responses, none of the respondentsapplied for, or received, benefits under this program during the reviewperiod.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Export Processing Zones</ITAG>Under the Industrial Estates Authority of Thailand Act, firms located indesignated export processing zones and industrial estates receive tax andimport duty exemptions on: (1) Machinery used for factory constructionand operation; (2) goods imported for use in the production of exports;(3) items produced for export; and (4) items imported for re-export. Accordingto the responses, none of the respondents have facilities located in government-sponsoredexport processing zones or industrial estates.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Additional Incentives Under the IPA</ITAG>Petitioner alleges that the following incentives are available to manufacturers,producers and exporters of pipe fittings:andbullet; <T3>Section 31</T3> of the IPA provides a three-to-eight year exemptionfrom payment of corporate income tax on profits derived from promoted activities,as well as deductions from net profits for losses incurred during the taxexemption period.andbullet; <T3>Section 33</T3> of the IPA provides a five-year tax exemption for goodwilland royalty payments.andbullet; <T3>Section 34</T3> provides an additional deduction from taxable incomefor dividends paid on promoted activities.andbullet; <T3>Section 36(2)</T3> provides an exemption of import duties and businesstaxes on items imported for re-export.andbullet; <T3>Section 36(3)</T3> provides an exemption of export duties and businesstaxes on products produced or assembled by promoted firms.andbullet; <T3>Section 36(4)</T3> provides a deduction from assessable income of anamount equal to five percent of the increased income over the previousyear derived from exports.According to the responses, none of the respondent companies received benefitsunder any of these sections of the IPA during the review period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>In accordance with section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the informationused in making our final determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>In accordance with section 703(d) of the Act, we are directing the U.S.Customs Service to suspend liquidation on all entries of pipe fittingsfrom Thailand which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after the date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and to require a cash deposit or bond for eachsuch entry equal to 2.85 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3> This suspension will remain in effect until furthernotice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment</ITAG>In accordance with 19 CFR 355.38 of the Department's regulations publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 27, 1988 (54 FR 52306, to be codifiedat 19 CFR andSection;355.38), we will hold a public hearing, if requested,to afford interested parties an opportunity to comment on this preliminarydetermination on December 15, 1989 at 10:30 a.m., at the U.S. Departmentof Commerce, Room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington,DC 20230.
