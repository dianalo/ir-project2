Falling oil prices &quot;conjured up visions of subdued inflation and gave both the bond and stock markets a shot in the arm,&quot; said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.    Early in the day, bond prices drifted slightly lower but they quickly reversed direction as oil prices slumped. Some actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds wound up with gains of about three-quarters of a point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount.    That brought their total gains over the past three days to about 3 1/4 points, or $32.50 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the latest 30-year Treasury bonds has fallen to 9 1/8% from nearly 9 1/2% late Friday.    Until recently, the dollar's prolonged drop against other major currencies had prompted many investment managers to expect higher interest rates. They reasoned that a lower dollar eventually would translate into higher inflation and discourage foreign investors from buying dollar-denominated securities    Though numerous analysts still share those concerns, thesudden collapse of oil prices has dominated investorattention lately, particularly because oil specialists arepredicting further sharp declines this winter.   &quot;The lower dollar hasn't led to a pickup in inflation, at least not yet,&quot; said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank. &quot;If oil prices drop further or remain about where they are now, that implies less inflationary pressure for next year.&quot;    The size of this week's bond rally provided another reminder of how much the U.S. interest-rate outlook can hinge on developments within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The oil cartel is widely perceived to be hampered by intense internal bickering that analysts say is likely to continue. OPEC's price and production agreement announced earlier this week was generally greeted with derision. So were comments by oil ministers that they won't cheat any more on price or production quotas.    Nevertheless, some analysts contend that investors may be exaggerating the importance of the oil news.    &quot;I think the bond markets are paying undue attention to the oil price situation and are ignoring other factors which could be potentially inflationary,&quot; Mr. Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover said. Among these factors, he said, are the dollar's continued decline as well as the high rate of capacity utilization in the U.S. economy.    The Federal Reserve Board reported earlier this week that the nation's factories, utilities and mines operated at 81.7% of capacity in November. That was the highest level in more than three years and was up from 81.5% in October. For factories alone, the operating rate was the highest since 1980. The higher capacity-utilization rate reflects growing strength in the industrial sector.    The stock market's huge decline may prompt consumers to cut back on spending, leading to slower economic growth early next year. But most analysts in several recent surveys remain confident that the economy will escape a recession next year.    &quot;Autumn's plunge in stock prices has forced the economics profession to rethink 1988 economic prospects,&quot; said an article in a Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. publication released yesterday. The article in the Morgan Economic Quarterly said &quot;a majority&quot; of forecasters have lowered both their economic growth and inflation projections for the coming year, while a few have predicted a recession.    But Morgan Guaranty economists disagree. The bank hasn't changed its precrash outlook &quot;materially&quot; since Oct. 19. A continuation of &quot;moderate&quot; economic growth &quot;still seems the most likely prospect,&quot; the Morgan publication said. By &quot;moderate,&quot; the article said it means &quot;close to the 3% trend of the past three years,&quot; after adjusting for inflation. &quot;That is so despite a high probability of some weakening of consumer spending from what otherwise would have prevailed.&quot;    &quot;Without question, the stock market's plunge has injected new uncertainties into the economic outlook,&quot; the Morgan publication said. &quot;But, in light of the strong trade sector, deterioration on the inflation front seems the greater worry for 1988 than does the possibility of recession.&quot;    Yesterday, though, inflation fears eased as oil prices tumbled. The bond rally also reflected growing speculation that Congress may adjourn without increasing the nation's borrowing limit or authorizing the Treasury to issue more long-term bonds.    Bond traders also were encouraged by a large decline in the closely watched interest rate on federal funds, which are reserves that banks lend each other overnight. The funds rate, which averaged about 6 1/2% Tuesday and around 6 3/4% Monday, dropped to 3% at one point late yesterday.    But traders noted that yesterday was the final day of a two-week accounting period, in which banks must settle their reserve positions with the Federal Reserve. The funds rate often gyrates wildly on such days. For example, on Dec. 2, the funds rate ranged from 3% to 11%.    The Treasury's latest 30-year bonds were quoted late yesterday at a price of 97 10/32 to yield 9.14%. That compared with late Tuesday's price of 96 18/32, to yield 9.21%. The government's latest 10-year notes were quoted late yesterday at 99 3/32 to yield 9.01%, compared with Tuesday's close of 98 26/32 with a yield of 9.05%.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds advanced 7.86 points yesterday to 1232.62. That was close to its high for the day of 1235.07. The low was 1216.95.    Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills edged lower. The latest three-month bill rate dipped to 5.93% bid from 5.94% Tuesday, while the latest six-month bill rate declined to 6.39% bid from 6.42%.    Corporate bond prices also rallied yesterday, and several large new debt issues were offered to investors.    Among these were $100 million issue of McDonnell Douglas Corp. notes due in five years. These 9 3/8% notes were offered by underwriters yesterday at a price of 99.812 to yield 9.422%. That was 0.85 of a percentage point above the rate on five-year Treasury notes, according to Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, the lead underwriter. The notes, which are noncallable for three years, are rated single-A-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and single-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    In the high-yield, high-risk &quot;junk&quot; bond market, prices of Western Union Corp. bonds rose especially sharply yesterday. Traders pointed to the company's decision, announced Tuesday, to sweeten once again the terms of its restructuring plan. Some Western Union issues soared between three and six points.    Western Union said yesterday the Securities and Exchange Commission had declared effective its registration statement covering $500 million of 16 1/2% senior secured reset notes due in 1992. The notes were priced at 99.50, according to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the sole underwriter.    The annual interest rate will be reset in February 1988 and June 1989. Western Union said that reset rate will be the greater of the rate in effect immediately prior to the resetting, or the rate that will result in giving the notes a market value at the time of 101% of their principal amount. A Drexel spokesman said the notes are rated Caa by Moody's and triple-C-plus by Sandamp;P.    Elsewhere in the credit markets, underwriters led by Merrill Lynch offered $200 million issue of notes by the province of Nova Scotia. The 9 5/8% notes, due Jan. 1, 1995, were priced yesterday at par. The 9 5/8% yield was three-quarters of a percentage point above the rate on seven-year Treasury notes. The Nova Scotia notes are noncallable and are rated single-A-2 by Moody's and single-A-minus by Sandamp;P.    In the municipal bond sector, a large new issue by the Intermountain Power Agency was repriced by underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. The issue totals about $358.1 million of revenue refunding bonds. Under the new scale, yields range from 7.40% on bonds due in 1998 to 9.25% on bonds due in 2020. Previously, yields ranged from 7.50% in 1998 to 9.30% in 2020.    Separately, Baltimore County, Md., postponed plans to sell about $163.5 million of general obligation bonds, according to investment bankers here. Earlier this week, underwriters led by Citicorp Investment Bank had tentatively priced the bonds to yield from 5.75% in 1990 to 7.79% in 2017. </TEXT></DOC>
