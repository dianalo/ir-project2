The stock and cash transaction has an indicated value of about $277.6 million.    But one of the creditors, Energy Service Co., which itself has proposed to acquire Gearhart, insisted that it doesn't want sweetened terms but instead still seeks to acquire the ailing company, either on Ensco's own or as part of a group.    Dallas-based Halliburton and Fort Worth, Texas-based Gearhart, both oil-service companies, stressed that despite the definitive agreement, many hurdles remain to complete the merger, including a federal antitrust review and agreement by the creditors.    Although the lenders haven't yet agreed to the terms, &quot;it's in striking distance,&quot; said Robert Bailey, Gearhart's chief financial officer. In addition to the problem raised by Ensco, he said, the absence of a lead lender makes negotiations more difficult.    While Mr. Bailey said the latest meeting with debt holders was positive, he added, &quot;There's always someone who says 'no' and says, 'I want green stamps, too.'&quot;    Ensco, an oil-service company in Houston, just yesterday said it increased its holdings of Gearhart senior subordinated notes to $66.7 million from $29.5 million, giving it a controlling position of that class of debt.    Gearhart has a total of about $445 million of debt outstanding. Before Halliburton and Gearhart signed the letter of intent, Ensco proposed to acquire Gearhart in a complex transaction valued at $258.8 million.    &quot;Ensco stands ready to reopen (merger) discussions with Gearhart,&quot; an Ensco spokesman said. Ensco, he said, acquired Gearhart debt as a &quot;strategic move to participate in the restructuring of Gearhart.&quot;    The total indicated value of Halliburton's offer is the same under the definitive agreement, even though the terms were changed slightly. Holders of Gearhart's about 41 million common shares and 1986 and 1987 convertible preferred would receive 0.02917 share of Halliburton common for each Gearhart share, down from 0.03575 Halliburton share under the letter of intent.    Under the proposal to creditors, holders of Gearhart debt and redeemable preferred stock will still receive $230 million, plus additional Halliburton shares.    Halliburton rose 87.5 cents to $32.375 a share, and Gearhart fell 6.25 cents to 87.5 cents a share, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Ensco fell 12.5 cents to $2.75 a share in American Stock Exchange composite trading.    Both Halliburton and Gearhart said they have complied with Justice Department requests for additional documents for its review of potential antitrust problems. Most of the oil-field service operations of Gearhart and Halliburton coincide. In many of the areas of overlap, Schlumberger Ltd. dominates the business, with as much as two-thirds of the market in some cases.    Gearhart argues that a stronger, merged company will actually increase competition. Without a merger, Gearhart's Mr. Bailey said, &quot;in all probability (Gearhart) will end up in bankruptcy, and coming out of bankruptcy you're usually just a shadow of your former self.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
