(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Scales, Thomas; Switz, Richard; Willis, Jack.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>THE PRICE IS RIGHTandM;To the Editor:andM;I read with interest the Executive Briefing in the May 22 issue.andP;  I amsurprised that the Microsoft 900 service is not more popular at a price of $2per hour.andP;  I would certainly take advantage of the service at that price, butprobably will not at a price of $2 per minute.andM;Thomas ScalesandM;Product Development ManagerandM;Policy Management Systems Corp.andM;Blythewood, S.C.andM;ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALLandM;To the Editor:andM;Your recent poll on LIM EMS 4.0-compatible boards (April 23) did not mentionthe difference between hardware and software compatibility as it relates tothe LIM specification.andP;  Specifically, the Everex RAM 3000 board is nothardware-compatible with version 4.0; it seems to work only with version 3.2of the specification.andM;Quoting from James Forney's book entitled &quot;MS-DOS Beyond 640K: Working withExtended and Expanded Memory&quot;: &quot;Possibly the best way to understand thedifference between 3.2 and 4.0 is that 3.2 was good for data.andP;  The 4.0specification is good for running both code and data.&quot; This meanshardware-incompatible boards will be useless for running multitasking andother programs which try to move code from the 640K domain.andM;Richard SwitzandM;ConsultantandM;El Segundo, Calif.andM;CRANKY CALLERandM;To the Editor:andM;I read Matt Kramer's column on calling number identification (April 23) withsome interest.andP;  It struck me as quite sane.andP;  I read Henry Lustig's inaneletter in reply (May 28) and blew my top.andM;I have three major problems with the knee-jerk supporters of CNID:andM;First, they seem to think they are the public, instead of just part of it.andO;Sure, Mr. Lustig pays for his phone.andP;  So do I. So does the telemarketing firmthat annoys us both.andP;  I'm sure it pays a lot more for its phone service thaneither of us do.andP;  By the implicit logic of Mr. Lustig's argument, that shouldallow the telemarketing firm to do anything it wishes with its phones.andP;  Ijust hang up on telemarketers I do not want to talk to.andP;  It has neveroccurred to me to try and run them out of business.andP;  I have always assumedthey provide a useful service to some segment of the public, or they wouldnot stay in business.andM;Second, the CNID supporters seem unable to grasp that there are groups withlegitimate reasons not to have their phone numbers sent out with every call.andO;Besides battered women and children, these include every police department,social services organization, radio and television station, newspaper andmost government agencies.andP;  I think they have a valid argument for not wantingto give away their private numbers.andP;  Mr. Lustig's suggestion that those &quot;whofeel they stand to lose by [his] knowing they call need not do so&quot; makesabout as much sense as my suggesting that if he does not want them to call heshouldn't have a phone.andM;Third, I have not figured out what people like Mr. Lustig plan to do with allthe phone numbers they are going to get.andP;  Are they going to turn them over tothe police and demand prosecution of every &quot;greasy fingered low-IQ creature&quot;that annoys them?andM;Finally, the lines about &quot;anti-tech social tinkerers&quot; and being &quot;concernedabout the rights of criminals and fringe groups&quot; made me gag.andP;  If Hitler hadhad computers, one can almost hear the same lines being levied against Jewswho argued against having to register with the government's computerizedpersonnel tracking system.andM;Jack WillisandM;Colorado Springs, Colo.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
