LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Only a handful of bystanders watched as actorJames Spader strode out of Ed's Sandwich Shop, tossed his scarfover his right shoulder and turned around to do it over again andagain and again.   Hollywood comes to midtown St. Louis.   If it weren't for the fact that the street was blocked off forthe cameras, the sight hardly would have stopped traffic.   ``It's not like we're setting houses on fire,'' said SpookyStevens, the publicist for the movie ``White Palace,'' starringSpader and Susan Sarandon. ``After 20 minutes of standing out hereand freezing to death, they'll go home.'' Sure enough, most peopledidn't stay long, but then St. Louisans have gotten used to havingthe ``White Palace'' crew around town.   In fact, movie-making has become more and more routine allacross Missouri in recent years, thanks in part to the efforts ofthe Missouri Film Commission and the St. Louis Film Partnership,both just a few years old.   The commission was formed in 1985 as a program of the state'sDepartment of Economic Development. The partnership was started twoyears later. It is funded by the St. Louis County Economic Council,the city of St. Louis, the St. Louis Convention and VisitorsCommission, the Regional Commerce and Growth Association and theRegional Cultural and Performing Arts Development Commission.   The two groups have jumped headfirst into a worldwide tussle formovie dollars, competing with more established film commissions inother states, cities and even foreign countries. All try to woofilmmakers with slick catalogs, location scouting and experttechnical help.   Still, even though 42 states have film offices and activelycompete for business, California remains the film leader of theUnited States, with New York close at its heels.   Though not always cheaper, it's easier to make a movie outsideCalifornia. One-stop, state-controlled film offices are preferredto California's patchwork approach, where local governments issuepermits with fluctuating fees and have requirements that are 70years old.      And the long-held belief that Hollywood could re-create anythingfrom the Tara plantation in ``Gone With the Wind'' to the Las VegasStrip in ``One From the Heart'' has been abandoned by filmmakerswho want greater realism.   ``It's very stale to shoot in the same place,'' said KateArnold, production coordinator for the Missouri Film Commission.``Authenticity is important these days.''   It's important for the cities and states that land the films,too. During the first year of its existence, the film commissionhelped bring in $4.1 million to the state's economy. Last year, thefilm industry meant $16.5 million to Missouri.   ``On-location filming is a growing industry that brings dollarsand jobs to the state,'' said Gary Gonder, manager of thecommission. ``These major projects also put the spotlight onMissouri, which helps our state industrial recruitment efforts,too.''   Since May, four features have been filmed in the state:   _ ``White Palace,'' based on St. Louisan Glenn Savan's firstnovel about a yuppie St. Louis advertising executive who, after thedeath of his young wife, becomes obsessed with a lusty, older womanwho works in a fast-food restaurant. All but three days are beingfilmed in and around St. Louis, and the movie is expected to bereleased in the fall of 1990.   _ ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge,'' starring Paul Newman and JoanneWoodward and filmed around Kansas City. Based on two novels, ``Mrs.Bridge'' and ``Mr. Bridge'' by Evan S. Connell, the story spans 40years in the lives of a quintessential American couple in KansasCity. Shooting is completed, and the movie is expected to bereleased next summer. Arnold said that while Newman was filming inKansas City, the makers of Cordon Negro champagne spent more than$1 million there to film a commercial with him.   _ ``Miss Missouri,'' a French production filmed in Kansas Cityand surrounding communities. The story is about a former MissMissouri who travels to Europe and falls in love with a Frenchman.Afraid he will discover that she had been married before and has achild, she flees and returns to her home. The shooting iscompleted, and the movie is scheduled to premiere at the CannesFilm Festival next spring.   _ ``Detour,'' an independent production directed by KansasCitian Wade Williams and filmed mostly in Kansas City. It's a newversion of a 1945 movie about a man who picks up a hitchhiker andgets involved in murder. The shooting is scheduled to be completedin December.   What sold the movie moguls on Missouri?   In the case of ``White Palace,'' a big reason was the desire tocapture the real flavor of St. Louis, where the story takes place.``Why try to import natural flavor when you have it right here?''said Stevens.   The efforts of the two film commissions paid off, too, she said.   But sometimes winning the hearts of a movie producer doesn't goso smoothly.   The makers of ``Parenthood,'' a story supposedly set in St.Louis, opted to forfeit realism for warm weather and shoot inOrlando, Fla. But then again, ``Escape From New York'' was shot inSt. Louis, not New York.   Janis Rockwell-Strong, executive director of the St. Louis FilmPartnership, set about luring the producers of ``White Palace'' toSt. Louis months before their cameras rolled into town. When sheheard that the movie rights to the book had been bought, shestarted firing off letters.   ``I said I'm from St. Louis, this is a book from St. Louis and Iwant you to know we're interested,'' Rockwell-Strong said.   Over the following months, Rockwell-Strong took dozens ofpictures of various St. Louis neighborhoods and sent them off tothe producers. Then she took them around town when they came tolook for themselves.   ``I rented the van and we showed them St. Louis,''Rockwell-Strong said. ``We showed them the various looks.''   It worked. Filming began Oct. 25.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PM Thurs Dec. 28</NOTE></DOC>
