BIGELOW</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 37-ton Hercules cargo plane, salvaged fromAntarctic ice and snow more than 16 years after it crashed, is setto arrive in California this week, officials said Tuesday.   ``The airplane is just in the final stages of rework at Air NewZealand in Christchurch,'' U.S. Navy Cmdr. Keith Armstrong said bytelephone from Point Mugu Naval Air Station, about 50 milesnorthwest of downtown Los Angeles.   The huge, once-icebound LC-130 Hercules is expected to arriveFriday at the Navy's Antarctic Development Squadron 6, the``Puckered Penguins,'' who fly support missions for the NationalScience Foundation in Antarctica.   So far, about $4.2 million has been spent to excavate the planeand overhaul it, said Guy Guthridge, a National Science Foundationspokesman in Washington.   An additional $2.8 million still must be spent to install newelectronic equipment at Cherry Point, N.C., Guthridge added. Butthat's cheaper than the $35 million price tag for a replacementplane.   The aircraft is specifically designed and equipped to operate inpolar climates, including the use of one-ton, teflon-coated``wheel-skis'' needed to break the grip of ice on takeoff.   ``We left the plane there in '71 because we simply had nocapability in place to go back to a remote location in extremelycold weather and retrieve it,'' Guthridge said.   The Hercules was one of seven owned by the foundation, and itsloss ``affected our ability to install science projects in thefield, which really is the payoff of our program,'' Guthridge said.   Over a 42-day period the cargo plane was dug from the snow thathad buried all but the top 3 feet of the plane's 38-foot high tailand it flew out on Jan. 10, 1988.   Much of the time since then was spent in Christchurch, NewZealand, where it was inspected and renovated before it is returnedto the United States, Guthridge said.   ``A lot of people were worried that the stresses induced by theaircraft being covered in snow would damage the air frame,''Guthridge said.   But the salvage crew was surprised to find that the below-zeroclimate, with air too frigid to carry moisture, had preserved theLockheed aircraft amazingly well, said Joe Dabney, a spokesman forthe manufacturer in Marietta, Ga.   ``It was in effect just frozen, with no deterioration in thestructure,'' Dabney said.   Lockheed engineers found many of the hydraulic systems were stillworking, the electronics still worked, there still was air in thetires and fuel in the tanks, Dabney said.   The Hercules was abandoned in December 1971 at a remote site,about 700 miles from McMurdo Sound, after supplying fuel and othersupplies to a scientific team measuring snow accumulation on theEast Antarctic Plateau.   The field team, part of a joint American, French and Sovieteffort, was in a rugged area of high winds and snow accumulation,said Winifred Reuning, National Science Foundation spokeswoman.   The pilot was forced to abort on takeoff after a jetmalfunctioned, Ms. Reuning said.   The pilot managed a crash landing, damaging the front landing skiand nose of the aircraft. But the crew and several French scientistswho were aboard walked away without injury.</TEXT></DOC>
