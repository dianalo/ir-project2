This measure is constructed to take a single valuein starting from the area under a recall-precision graph for a rankedoutput and to distinguish meaningful ranking with a positive value between0 and 1 from meaningless ranking with a negative value. It is clarifiedtoo that the measure must be useful in practice to evaluate the rankingperformance made by various ranking function models and to choose thebest ranking models among them.</TEXT></DOC>
