In a report on Tuesday, the NASD Regulatory Review Task Forcesaid many brokerage firms already had so-called Chinese wallprocedures designed to keep sensitive information from leaking froma firm's mergers and acquisition staff to its trading staff.   But the report said neither the Securities and ExchangeCommission nor self-regulatory organizations such as the NASD,which operates the over-the-counter stock market, have establishedstandards for Chinese wall procedures.   Regulators must do a better job of making sure the informationbarriers are effective, said the task force, which began work ayear ago and was headed by A.A. Sommer Jr., a securities lawyer andformer SEC commissioner.   It also recommended:   _requiring firms to more expeditiously announce news that couldaffect the price of their stocks, thus cutting down on theopportunity for illicit trading.   _improving NASD computer programs designed to detect unusualstock trading.   _abolishing limits on NASD fines for insider trading.   _making disciplinary records of brokers more readily availableto the public.   _passing legislation making it easier to restrict re-entry intothe securities business of brokers found guilty of seriousmisconduct.</TEXT></DOC>
