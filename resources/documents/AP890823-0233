Jones, 26, was the first person convicted in the nearlythree-year-old federal probe and her case had indirect links to theprosecution of former Drexel financier Michael Milken, who isaccused of racketeering and fraud.   A federal jury in March found Jones guilty on five counts ofperjury and two counts of obstruction of justice for lying to afederal grand jury in January 1988 in an investigation of tradinginvolving Drexel.   Jones plans to appeal the verdict.   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand dismissed arguments by Jones'lawyer that a prison term would cause greater psychological harm forthe one-time teen-age runaway, saying mental treatment would a partof her sentence.   The judge said Jones was aware she was breaking the law and saidher crimes ``pose a grave danger to law enforcement.''   ``There was a very conscious and deliberate decision which shemade to lie,'' Sand said. ``No one contends she did not know she waslying.''   Jones, who left home at age 14, climbed to a $100,000-a-year jobas an assistant bond trader in Drexel's high-yield junk bonddepartment in Beverly Hills, Calif.   In three appearances before the federal grand jury, Jones saidshe did not recall any discussions about stock ``parking'' incontacts with Princeton-Newport Partners LP, a defunct investmentfirm whose principals were convicted of securities fraud last month.   Jones worked for former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg, who wasconvicted in the Princeton-Newport case and faces other charges. AtJones' trial, prosecutors showed that transactions she handledconstituted parking, which involves concealing the true ownership ofstock.   Newberg reported directly to Milken, who has been indicted on 98counts of racketeering and securities fraud. Some of the charges inthe Princeton-Newport case overlap counts in Milken's indictment.   Jones' attorney, Daniel H. Bookin, argued that Jones had``substantially reduced mental capacity'' when she was questionedduring the Drexel investigation and that a jail term would beharmful to her. He cited a psychiatrist's report to bolster hisdefense.   Bookin said Jones had suffered a difficult life and Drexel became``the family she never had'' when ``she was thrust into the largestand most bitterly contested white-collar criminal investigation inhistory.''   But the government urged a sentence above the possible minimum 10to 16 months, on grounds that Jones' perjury severely impeded thegovernment's Drexel investigation.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Hansen said said Jones was offerednumerous chances to alter her grand jury testimony and cooperatewith prosecutors but did not.   The government said in court papers that Jones also gave about``150 demonstrably false answers'' about professional and personalmatters on the witness stand during her trial.   Sand said, ``Whether Bruce Newberg or others at Drexel werefamily or quasi-family or occupied some other sheltering ornurturing role in Miss Jones' life, it does not overcome the factthat there was a very conscious and deliberate decision which shemade to lie ... and to persist in a pattern of lying.''   New federal sentencing guidelines recommend a sentence of 18 to24 months imprisonment for the severity of the perjury theprosecution indicated Jones had committed. Federal law provided amaximum possible penalty of up to 35 years and a $1.75 million finefor the seven felony counts.   Sand ordered her to serve 18 months in a minimum security women'sprison in Phoenix, Ariz., where he said she would have access tomental health therapy.   Sand also ordered 2{ years of supervised work release withcontinued mental health treatment. Jones was fined $25,000 plus thecost of her incarceration and supervised release, for a total of$51,531.50.   The judge said he would rule Sept. 13 whether to allow Jones toremain free on bond pending an appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
