A quick and accurate device for re-aligning guide rails which considerablyreduces the amount of down-time needed for this procedure, cutting downsignificantly on production losses, has now been designed and manufacturedwithin the Mine Hoisting Technology Programme of the CSIR's Divisionof Materials Science and Technology. The technique makes use of a setof beams which can survey the alignment of all guide rails of a shaftcompartment during a single pass through the shaft. 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
