Many investment strategists now expect higher interest rates soon.    Government statistics showing unexpectedly strong economic growth aroused renewed inflation fears and sent Treasury bonds into their sharpest one-day tailspin in about 4 1/2 months. Further signs of economic strength and higher inflation emerge from a survey of corporate purchasing managers, released this morning.    Hopes for a credit-easing move by the Federal Reserve have vanished. Some analysts even predict tighter credit after the elections, especially if the dollar drops in the foreign-exchange markets. Even if the Fed doesn't tighten, bond traders say a huge wave of Treasury borrowing this week will intensify pressures for higher borrowing costs.    The government's employment report Friday &quot;makes it clear that the economy is not falling over the brink,&quot; says Steven G. Einhorn, a partner at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and co-chairman of the investment policy committee. Those figures, coupled with continued concern about the dollar, &quot;will discourage people from assuming that we're on the doorstep of a Fed easing. And without a Fed easing, we would expect a gradual rise in rates that should act to collar the stock market.&quot;    Prices of benchmark Treasury bonds tumbled by nearly two points, or almost $20 for each $1,000 face amount, last Friday. The previous day, some issues had reached their highest levels since mid-April amid speculation that the employment numbers would show economic sluggishness.    Instead, the Labor Department reported strong gains in business hiring and a drop in the civilian unemployment rate. Bond traders were especially startled by the department's report that nonfarm payrolls expanded by 323,000 last month, following a revised gain of 304,000 in September. The civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.3% from 5.4%, matching a rate in June that was the lowest in 14 years.    &quot;This report is clear-cut. What it shows very clearly is that while the economy isn't booming, it also isn't slowing enough to prevent an acceleration of inflation,&quot; says Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank.    &quot;As long as the Fed faces a possibility of slightly accelerating inflation, it will lean more toward raising rates than it will toward lowering rates,&quot; Mr. Fine says. &quot;My instinct is they (bond yields) will rise some more.&quot;    Another factor likely to lead to higher rates is the recent wave of corporate takeovers and buy-out proposals. &quot;Previous episodes of heavy merger and buy-out activity have produced surging short-term business credit, especially from banks,&quot; according to a Salomon Brothers Inc. report. &quot;Generally, money market rates were also forced higher.&quot;    Takeovers already may be driving up some short-term rates. For example, the federal funds rate has been averaging around 8 3/8% lately, up from 8 1/8%. The rise in the funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight, &quot;can be partly ascribed to greater precautionary demands for reserves&quot; by banks, the Salomon analysts conclude.    &quot;Perhaps bank money managers are attempting to increase their access to day-to-day financing sources in preparation for large needs ahead,&quot; the Salomon analysts say. &quot;Whether the immediate pressure on funds dissipates, however, this factor is likely to re-emerge when the recently announced restructurings reach the financing stage later this year.&quot;    These pressures come at a time when the government is planning to sell a large volume of new debt. The Treasury will sell about $9.5 billion of three-year notes tomorrow, $9.5 billion of 10-year notes Wednesday, and $11 billion of 37-day cash management bills Thursday.    All this borrowing will be in addition to the government's regular weekly auction today of short-term bills. The government also is expected to sell $9 billion of 30-year Treasury bonds late this month or early in December.    Several money managers are shunning long-term bonds because they can get nearly the same returns on shorter-term issues that have much less volatility.    For example, 30-year Treasury bonds late Friday were yielding 8.91%, only 0.40 percentage point above the yield on three-year Treasury notes. That spread is down from 0.44 percentage point Thursday and 0.59 percentage point about three months earlier.    Nevertheless, some bond managers say any increase in yields probably won't last long. They argue that investors overreacted to the employment report, that the economy isn't growing as rapidly as it was earlier this year, and that inflation will remain subdued.    Also, Treasury bonds are likely to remain popular with investors seeking a safe haven from all the turbulence in the industrial corporate bond market lately, several bond analysts predict. Prices of many industrial bonds have fallen sharply because of huge buy-out and corporate restructuring proposals that would lead to the creation of mountains of new debt, undermining the value of existing bonds.    Still, the employment report Friday jolted bond managers and analysts. &quot;For fixed-income markets, the report is an unambiguous negative, across the board in all fixed-income securities,&quot; concludes Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. Economic Advisors Inc.    It also is a negative for stocks, according to Mr. Sinai, because it &quot;suggests a scenario of too much growth, too high inflation, higher interest rates, and ultimately a slowdown and perhaps a recession.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Bond prices plummeted immediately after the government released a report showing the economy is considerably stronger than had been expected.    Treasury bonds finished the day very close to their lowest levels of the session. The government's benchmark 30-year issue fell to 102 1/4, a decline of 1 7/8 points, or $18.75 for each $1,000 face amount. That was the largest one-day setback since June 16.    The 30-year bonds finished the week yielding 8.91%. That was up from 8.74% Thursday.    Among other active issues, the government's benchmark 10-year notes tumbled to 102 19/32 from 103 29/32. The yield rose to 8.84% from 8.65%.    The new three-year Treasury notes to be auctioned tomorrow were quoted late Friday in when-issued trading at 8.51%, up from 8.30% Thursday.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 18.62 points to 1256.51. That was the largest drop since Aug. 10, when it fell by exactly the same amount. On June 16, it fell by 18.74 points. The index ended the day just above its low for the session of 1255.19. The high was 1264.03.    The total return on the bonds in the index now stands at 8.51%. Total return includes both price changes and total interest income.    Ginnie Maes and other mortgage-backed issues also fell, but less so than Treasury issues. Active issues were down 1/2 to 3/4 point. Municipal bond prices declined by about the same amount. The volume of new municipal issues this week is expected to be significantly smaller than in the past several weeks.    Corporate bond prices declined by 1/4 to 1 1/4 points in light trading. Investors are continuing to avoid industrial issues because of fears that there will be another wave of large takeovers before the Reagan administration leaves office. Takeover specialists believe that the next administration may not feel as friendly toward megadeals as this administration has felt. </TEXT></DOC>
