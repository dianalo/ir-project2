But he blamed Congress for not doing more tostrengthen the banking system.   The presidential signature sets in motion a series of banklaw changes that will require regulators to increaseregulation as bank capital declines and curb the government'sability to prop up sick banks. The changes will be phased inbetween now and 1995.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, the law allows the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp. to borrow about $70 billion from the Treasury toreplenish the depleted Bank Insurance Fund and pay the costsof resolving bank failures.   The banking industry is supposed to pay back the loans,with interest, so that taxpayers won't have to bail out thebank fund, as they currently are bailing out the fund thatprotects savings-and-loan deposits. Bankers worry that theirinsurance premium, currently 23 cents per $100 of domesticdeposits, will rise quickly under the new law, curbingprofits and hampering their ability to lend.   Last spring, the administration issued a far-reachingproposal to modernize bank laws by allowing banks to branchnationwide, affiliate with securities and insurance firms andbecome part of financial-services conglomerates owned bycommercial companies. The goal was to allow banks to boostprofits and diversify their risk, but Congress rejected mostof the proposals.   As a result, the new law &quot;does nothing to restore thecompetitiveness of the banking industry,&quot; Mr. Bush said in astatement. &quot;While it demands that banks increase capital andpay higher deposit insurance premiums, it gives no additionaltools to banks to meet these demands. This short-sightedcongressional response to the problems we face increasestaxpayer exposure to bank losses,&quot; he said.   In his statement, the president said the administration isprepared to work for &quot;comprehensive reform&quot; next year, butbanking legislation, which is becoming increasinglypoliticized, faces little prospect of passage in an electionyear.   Meanwhile, House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez(D., Texas) warned that the administration is risking morebank failures by advocating &quot;go-easy policies for bankregulation.&quot; Rep. Gonzalez used the release of a committeestudy on the January failure of the Bank of New England toaccuse the administration of urging bank regulators tolighten up to &quot;reduce the political heat from the creditcrunch and the sagging national economy.&quot; A Treasuryspokeswoman called the comments &quot;ridiculous.&quot;   Earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady andother administration officials met with about 500 bankexaminers and asked them to follow examination proceduresthat encourage banks to make sound loans and to help troubledborrowers work out their problems.   The banking panel's report on the events leading up to thefailure of the Bank of New England, which will cost the FDICabout $2.5 billion, follows earlier government summaries ofthe managerial and regulatory lapses that allowed the bank'sproblems to grow.   &quot;As the report on the Bank of New England establishes,credit problems cannot be solved by bad loans and weakregulation,&quot; Mr. Gonzalez said in a statement.</TEXT></DOC>
