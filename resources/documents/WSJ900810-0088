At Northwest, the fuel staff went intoa crisis mode the night before Iraq invaded Kuwait.   All that day, they had watched the price volatility on twocomputer screens that provide up-to-the-minute price changes.By 8 p.m., things were looking grim. &quot;We went home that nightsaying we may be in big trouble,&quot; says R.

Because airlines are alsoparticularly vulnerable to recession, the industry can bedoubly hurt if rising energy prices also lead to an economicslowdown.   Helane Becker, airline analyst at Lehman Brothers,believes the crisis &quot;puts into jeopardy the very survival offinancially weak carriers,&quot; such as Pan Am Corp.'s PanAmerican World Airways, Eastern Airlines and Trans WorldAirlines. Those airlines say they're taking aggressive actionto weather the storm. But it's clear that carriers with olderfleets -- such as Northwest, Pan Am and TWA -- will be hithard.   Some older planes might be parked, and others might besold sooner than expected. But the market for the old planesjust got a lot softer, which creates a whole different seriesof problems for several carriers, such as UAL Corp.   TWA and Pan Am were barely hobbling along anyway. NWAInc., parent of Northwest Airlines, has been stretching tomake debt payments following a leveraged buy-out. The two NewYork shuttles -- both up for sale -- were having troublefinding buyers. And the proposed acquisition of UAL alreadyappeared in jeopardy.   All those problems now are worse. Consider Northwest. WhenAlfred A. Checchi was negotiating with banks to finance thebuy-out of the company last year, he projected that fuelprices would average about 70.2 cents a gallon for this year.But the price has been well above that even before thecrisis.   Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner has invited theheads of U.S. airlines to meet with him next week. &quot;I'mconcerned about the effect of rising airline fuel costs bothon the financial position of the industry and on thetraveling public,&quot; he told them.   Airline executives have already been holding emergencymeetings to figure out what to do. Northwest proposed an $8surcharge on tickets and other airlines said they'd raisefares by as much as 10%. Yesterday, carriers amended that:The new plan is to raise fares 5.3% as of next Wednesday.   TWA is considering budget cuts of up to 25% in somedepartments, but owner Carl Icahn says those have been in theworks for some time. America West Airlines is mulling plansto shelve the purchase of a fifth Boeing 747-200.   But price increases during a time of lax demand couldcreate new problems.   Carriers also are laying plans to re-emphasize fuel-savingprocedures used before when oil prices have skyrocketed.These include shutting down engines while waiting to takeoff, flying slower at cruising altitude, climbing morequickly to higher altitudes and extending flaps and landinggear later on descent.   Airlines buy their jet fuel as they need it, rather thanunder long-term contracts. They haven't yet figured out waysto safely hedge oil purchases in the futures markets. Theresult: Price rises have an immediate effect on a carrier'sbottom line.   &quot;An airline can start out at 8 a.m. with a delivery offuel that costs 60 cents a gallon. Then at 10 o'clock, therefiner can notify them that price per gallon of the deliveryscheduled for the next day is 75 cents,&quot; says George James,president of Airline Economics Inc., an industry consultingfirm.   And that's exactly what's been happening. Delta Air Linessays the per gallon price of its fuel has changed by at leastone cent every day since the crisis began last week. Priceshave gone from about 57.8 cents a gallon last month to asmuch as 80 cents a gallon this week -- an increase of 38%.Northwest says it is projecting that fuel may rise to as muchas 86 cents.   A mere one cent per gallon increase in the price of jetfuel adds $160 million to the industry's annual expenses.   Depending upon how long the crisis lasts, airlines alsocould face fuel-shortage problems. There have already beenseveral small crises. Last Friday, Northwest became concernedabout its Hong Kong service after Kuwait Petroleum Corp., oneof two fuel suppliers to the base, informed the carrier thatit would no longer be making deliveries. After severaltelephone calls, Northwest was able to get another supplierto cover the shortfall and Northwest flights out of Hong Kongwon't be affected.   But says Mr. Van Der Wege, &quot;We're watching the market andnational news reports literally minute-by-minute forunexpected developments.&quot;   Another difficult task for an international carrier likePan Am is keeping its numerous bases world-wide informed ofprice changes. Since fuel costs vary from airport to airport,Pan Am tries to buy as much fuel as possible at the locationswhere it's cheapest.   Traffic has been slow across the industry, and any furthererosion would hurt financially troubled carriers the most.Eastern is struggling to woo customers back since it filedfor Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection in March 1989. PanAm and TWA rely on trans-Atlantic business, much of itdiscounted travel; because those routes depend heavily onvacationers, they're unusually sensitive to price increasesand bad economic times.   &quot;We're on the razor's edge,&quot; says Kent Scott, the pilots'union leader at TWA.   Midway Airlines, which has been wielding its budget knifefor months, says it will consider a hiring freeze, amongother things, if the fuel situation worsens. &quot;We're sort ofat the mercy of world events,&quot; says Alfred Altschul, chieffinancial officer at Midway.   The surge in fuel prices has accelerated the company'scost-cutting campaign, he says. The day of the Iraqiinvasion, the company's fuel purchasers and revenue managershuddled late into the evening. &quot;What I did immediately wasreassess the company's expenses. We're looking at whetherwe're purchasing efficiently, where our overall head countstands, what flights we fly -- everything,&quot; says Mr.Altschul.   Aircraft built in the last decade are 30% more fuelefficient, on average, than the previous generation's. Forinstance, Airbus Industrie's twin-engine A-320 burns 5,200pounds of jet fuel an hour, while the Boeing 727, whichcarries roughly the same number of passengers, burns 6,600pounds an hour because of its three engines.   Northwest and TWA both depend heavily on aging DC-9s andBoeing 727s, while Pan Am has a large fleet of older,gas-guzzling 747 jumbo jets. TWA doesn't take delivery ofmore fuel-efficient Airbus Industrie A-330s until 1995. TheTrump Shuttle also depends largely on an older fleet ofBoeing 727s.   Ultimately, some of those planes might be parked, alongwith some of UAL's McDonnell Douglas DC-8s, which pose thesame cost problem.   Industry observers also expect to see airlines retireolder, fuel-inefficient planes more quickly than planned.Early this year, for example, amid high fuel prices, USAirGroup Inc. told Wall Street analysts it had identified about70 planes as retirement candidates because they cost too muchto run.   Even before the current crisis, Pan Am was planning tophase out some of its older 747s in favor of morefuel-efficient Airbus A-310s and A-300s, which are alreadydoing a large part of Pan Am's overseas flying. The companymay speed up the phase-out if the fuel crisis worsens.   At UAL, events in the Middle East promise, at best, toprolong the company's exhausting employee buy-out effort.Faced with an Aug. 9 financing deadline, Gerald Greenwald,head of the buy-out group, was forced to acknowledge to UAL'sboard this week that no banks would commit to financing the$4.38 billion plan with so much uncertainty in the economy.   The group received a 60-day extension to the deadline inorder to evaluate the crisis and continue working with banks.But the outlook is far from encouraging. In recent days, UALstock has settled at about $101 a share, its lowest level inyears, making it virtually impossible for banks to justifyfinancing the employees' $201 a share buy-out proposal.   Although the buy-out group figured a near-term recessioninto its five-year business plan for the airline, the group'sadvisers say it would have been virtually impossible topredict such a steep, swift rise in fuel prices. Last year,United spent $1.35 billion on fuel. The current run-up inprices could add $150 million to $400 million to that bill,according to industry analysts.   The unions were counting on using aircraft sale-leasebackarrangements to generate cash to pare down their bank debt.The leasing market has been soft for months. With the jump infuel prices, it is unlikely United would be able to get goodenough prices for its planes, especially the older 727s,737s, and 747s, which make up the bulk of its fleet.   Northwest also could find itself in a bind. An investorgroup led by Mr. Checchi took the airline private last yearin a $3.65 billion buy-out. Northwest still has $1.8 billionin debt to pay back.   The airline was counting on selling most of its planes toleasing companies to generate cash. But the leasing marketnosedived after the airline had sold only 17 of its planes.   When the crisis broke last week, Northwest pricing andfinance executives spent hours on the phone with refiners andoil industry analysts, trying to come up with new fuel costprojections. By Friday, the company was estimating additionalfuel costs of $180 million this year.   Even with a fare increase, Northwest &quot;will never recoverthe money we've lost in just the past few days&quot; from theprice rises, a spokesman says. Passengers have alreadypurchased 75% of tickets for flights booked in August, and30% of the tickets for September flights, all at lower,pre-crisis fares.   What's more, Northwest can do little to increase its fareson its Japanese routes, which generate a fifth of itsrevenues, since those fares are set by bilateral treaties.   Analysts who follow the industry now predict that carrierswill lose money this year as a result of the Iraqi invasion.Until recently, Airline Economics was forecasting a $400million to $500 million industry profit. Now it projects theindustry will record a deficit of $1 billion, which would bethe largest loss the industry has suffered since deregulationin 1978.   A major concern for airlines is whether a fare increasewill do more damage than good. Demand appeared to beslackening already. The most optimistic estimates projectthat traffic will increase a mere 1.5% in the second half ofthe year. Ms. Becker, the analyst at Lehman Brothers, saysshe believes that the fare increases &quot;might not stick&quot;because ticket bookings for the rest of the year &quot;don't lookstrong.&quot;   Travel agents also are shaking their heads at what couldbe steep fare increases. &quot;This won't be well-received.Everybody is looking for the bottom-line, best deal,&quot; saysErnestine Judkins, an agent at Amarillo Consolidated Travelin Texas. &quot;They'll just drive or stay home.&quot;   In recent days, some airlines appeared to be using thethreat of higher ticket prices to buoy sagging advancebookings. Citing fuel price uncertainty, Delta issued astatement Wednesday urging that &quot;travelers who can confirmtheir plans might be well advised to make their reservationsand purchase tickets now.&quot;   Airlines may have slacked off a bit on fuel conservationefforts in recent years. The elaborate fuel conservationprocedures initiated after the fuel crises of the '70s &quot;gotde-emphasized&quot; as petroleum prices dropped, says Capt. LarryRankin, a Pan Am pilot.   That may change quickly. Northwest flight dispatchers, whocompute the fuel amounts for each flight, are to gather withNorthwest executives over the next few days to devise newmethods of conserving fuel.   Certain government procedures and an overburdened airtraffic system also haven't been conducive to saving fuel.Increasingly, the Federal Aviation Administration is forcingaircraft to fly in holding patterns over airports for longerperiods before they land because there aren't enoughcontrollers to handle the planes.   Carriers also used to keep their aircraft parked at thegate until just before taking off. But the TransportationDepartment, in its monthly report card on carriers' ontimeperformance, now counts a flight as late if it leaves thegate more than 15 minutes after its scheduled departure time.   So crews leave the gate -- only to spend time sitting onthe taxiway with at least one engine running, guzzling fuel.   ---              The Skies are Unfriendly                                                                                                          Market share based on revenue passenger miles, as of June1990.
