Part of a broad rail industry effort to shed workers and compete with trucks, the program could &quot;substantially change&quot; shop worker furlough procedures industrywide, CSX said.    The Jacksonville, Fla., unit said if the program is adopted by labor unions, CSX would offer a $50,000 severance payment to those who represent about 15% of its work force assigned to repairing diesel locomotives. In addition, furloughed repair shop workers 57 years and older would be entitled to medical and life insurance coverage.    The program would help CSX realize its goal, announced last July, to slash its railroad work force by 8,200 from 40,000. Under that plan, CSX would offer payments of between $30,000 and $50,000 for most categories of railroad workers entitled to job protection; locomotive engineers would be entitled to separation payments of $75,000.    CSX said railroads traditionally have taken the position that shop workers who lose their jobs aren't entitled to job protection, such as is available to crew members who operate freight trains and can receive wages for as long as six years after being laid off under certain conditions. &quot;There are forms of protection for a large number of railroad workers,&quot; but job protection for shop crafts has been a matter of dispute between rail management and labor, said John Sweeney, a senior vice president of CSX Transportation. Mr. Sweeney said CSX would offer the severance payments to furloughed shop workers as &quot;a gesture of fairness&quot; to win labor support to its work force reductions and to avoid the possibility of lengthy arbitration.    &quot;We're not out to have confrontations,&quot; Mr. Sweeney said. &quot;We're out to have amicable settlements.&quot;    CSX said three shop craft unions have approved the separation program and negotiations are continuing with representatives of two other unions.    Some analysts questioned whether other railroads would adopt CSX's program to offer severance payments to furloughed shop workers. &quot;CSX has shown a willingness to be more generous than any other railroad in separation programs because its rail labor costs are higher,&quot; said Jeffrey Stone, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co. </TEXT></DOC>
