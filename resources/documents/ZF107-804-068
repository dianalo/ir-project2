Matthiesen Gainesville, FloridaandM;None of the articles or reviews in the September 12 issue on graphicalinterfaces mentioned a fact of critical importance to some PC users:graphical interfaces (GUIs) are virtually unusable by the blind.andM;Until recently, personal computers were an unalloyed blessing to the visuallyimpaired.andP;  Braille and speech interfaces to spreadsheets, word processors,and communications packages allowed the visually impaired an unprecedentedaccess to jobs, while electronic mail systems, publications on compact diskor on-line databases, and optical scanners combined with optical characterrecognition (OCR) software provided the means by which they could readwritten material that previously had to be braille-encoded or recordedverbally.andM;Widespread adoption of GUIs, however, could easily herald a return to the badold days.andP;  Screen readers, either braille-or speech-based, do not interpretgraphic characters, making icons essentially invisible.andP;  The screen cluttercaused by multiple windows can also render screen readers useless.andM;Furthermore, OCR software does not offer a practical solution to theseproblems.andP;  As your reviewer noted, the GUIs themselves require a heftyhardware platform to provide adequate response time.andP;  Imagine therequirements to not only run the graphical interface but also translate itsscreens into a textual format, all within a reasonable time!andM;This situation has not escaped notice.andP;  Congress, in its 508 bill, prohibitsthe U.S.andP;  Government from purchasing computer technology that cannot beadapted to the needs of handicapped workers.andP;  A machine or application thatis totally dependent on a graphical interface could not be legally purchasedby any agency of the government.andM;GUIs unarguably provide a superior interface for many users.andP;  Developers,however, should remember to provide alternatives for those who want or needthem.andM;Michael E. Darnell Orlando, FloridaandM;I know that graphical interfaces are the wave of the future and a wonderfuldevelopment chock-full of promise, but I'll be damned if I'll call them&quot;gooeys&quot; or any other such foolishness.andP;  Please get someone to work rightaway on finding a more suitable term.andP;  Just not Dvorak.andM;You will let us know what you come up with, won't you?andM;Fredrick Earl Upchurch Gastonia, North CarolinaandM;NEVER SAY NEVERandM;I found your comment &quot;PC Magazine will continue to cover the 286 market, butwewwon't award Editor's Choices because we can't recommend that you buy anyof them&quot; (&quot;286s: No Frills, Few Thrills,&quot; PC Magazine, September 12, 1989)insulting and presumptuous.andM;As a reader, consumer, and user, my task is to balance my needs against mydollars.andP;  As computer journalists, your task is to provide reliableinformation about PCs.andP;  According to your magazine, 40 percent of PC buyersfeel that a 286 is the machine of choice.andP;  Remember, customers are stillbuying 8086s and 8088s, happily sacrificing overrated PC power for dollars.andM;Please continue to select an Editor's Choice for each major category ofequipment (XTs, 286s, 386s, and so on), and leave the buying to us.andM;William J. Klenke Leavenworth, KansasandM;&quot;The best 286 computer you can buy is a 386SX&quot;?andP;  Has one of the clonemanufacturers finally gotten to you?andP;  No, I know: Intel must be putting themuscle on you to push the new chips.andP;  Your comparison of 21 286 computers inthe September 12 issue had good data, but you seem to have made some prettyunfair assumptions.andM;In the real world of mom-and-pop businesses, we can't get all excited overthe hottest and slickest new chips.andP;  What we want is a reliable machine at agood price, with decent service and easy-to-use software.andP;  What you want usto do is give up our $1,299 price on a good 286 machine in favor of a $1,799price on a computer that has nothing better to offer!andM;I know there are Fortune 500 companies out there that always buy the latestand greatest, no matter what the cost.andP;  But down here in the much largersmall-business arena, we have to justify our automation costs or we don'teat.andM;David L. Morris Dallas, TexasandM;HITTING THE STORESandM;After reading William Zachmann's bashing of computer retailers (William F.andO;Zachmann, PC Magazine, September 12, 1989), I thought it was time to tell thedealer's side of the story.andM;I receive at least five calls a day from people asking for technical helpwith mail-order accessories or computers they've just purchased.andP;  I have atleast three or four people a week stop in my store to get a good look and&quot;hands-on feel&quot; for a product they plan on buying mail-order.andM;Most manufacturers require dealers to have on-site service facilities andexpensive training for technical and sales representatives.andP;  Eightly percentof my customers are business owners who have had little if any PC experience.andO;My job is not only to sell them a system but, unlike mail-order outfits, tomake that system productive.andP;  Or else personally face the music.andM;I can justify my higher prices: it's called overhead.andP;  Rent, payroll,merchandise flooring, taxes, interest, and advertising.andP;  I'm not gettingrich, as Zachmann would like people to believe.andM;Computer stores still sell the vast majority of computers in this country andwithout them, the industry would wither away.andP;  Yes, there are plenty of &quot;bad&quot;computer stores out there, but there are also a lot of good ones--stores thatwill flourish because of good service.andM;David J. Raczka Lockport, New YorkandM;A large &quot;Congratulations!&quot; for the editorials of Machrone, Seymour, Zachmann(again), and Manes in the September 12 issue.andP;  I am a recent computer buyer.andO;I am also pursuing litigation against my &quot;friendly&quot; computer store formisrepresentation.andP;  It seems there is a motherboard in my system with &quot;16MHz&quot; written all over it, being driven at 20 MHz.andP;  This is after the salesmanand I discussed the sidebar entitled &quot;Crystals, Components, and the Dangersof Speed&quot; that appeared in your magazine (&quot;The Controversy Continues: 286 vs.andO;386,&quot; PC Magazine, June 27, 1989) and he assured me that his store did notsell overoscillated computers.andP;  Right.andM;I hope computer store managers, owners, or whoever gives a damn aboutsatisfaction (there is somebody, isn't there?) read your editorials and takeheed.andP;  I also caution any would-be buyers not to take anything for granted.andO;Check everything out.andP;  It should be worth a few hours of the salesperson'stime for you to spend a few thousand dollars of your money at his or herestablishment.andM;Two thumbs up for PC Magazine.andM;Michael Ogden Nashville, TennesseeandM;NOT QUITE DEAD-END USERandM;John Dvorak's latest diatribe (John C. Dvorak, PC Magazine, September 12,1989) reminds me of the bully on the block looking to punchsomeone--anyone--in the nose.andM;This time John has &quot;discovered&quot; that a lot of users are using only 1.7software packages.andP;  And if that wasn't bad enough, his mother-in-law has hadto take any number of courses to learn WordPerfect.andP;  What is the lesson to bedrawn from these two disparate facts?andP;  That the software companies havefoisted complex packages without standard interfaces on the helpless usercommunity and said community has rebelled by refusing to buy dozens of newpackages?andM;Come on, guy, get real.andP;  You've been in the PC business so long now you seemto have forgotten what the two most popular types of software packages(spreadsheets and word processing) supplanted: pencil-and-paper and thetypewriter.andP;  If I were to use only WordPerfect, that would still be a vastimprovement over the Selectric typewriter now gathering dust on my closetshelf.andM;Aside from WordPerfect, Quicken is the only other package I use with anyfrequency.andP;  A little over 1.7, I guess, but Dvorak would no doubt stillcalssify me a Dead-End User.andP;  Well, I've got news for you, buddy; this is allI want from my PC.andP;  Sound shocking?andP;  Here's more: I wouldn't mind ifWordPerfect were menu-oriented, but I was able to write, edit, and print aletter the first day I got the package using a relatively limited number ofcommands.andP;  I accomplished this amazing feat the old-fashioned way: I readjust a few pages of the documentation.andM;Simply put, John, the number of packages used does not equate to packageusefulness or customer satisfaction.andP;  John T. McMahon New York, New YorkandM;A MORE ATTRACTIVE PORTandM;The review of 14 data switches in your July 1989 issue (&quot;Data Switches: ALow-Cost LAN Alternative&quot;) contains an error-filled review of our SystemizerPlus Connectivity Network.andP;  The most glaring and damaging error in yourreview: our price per port was repeated several times in the article as$399--which, on the average, is twice the cost of all the other productsreviewed.andM;However, as your price per port was arrived at by dividing the retail priceof each box by the number of serial or parallel ports it contains, a morecareful analysis of our product would have revealed the existence of twoDB-25 connection ports on the back of the Systemizer Plus.andP;  Since oursuggested retail price is $399, dividing that by 2 yields a price per port of$200, which is on par with the majority of the boxes tested, and lower thanthe winners of your Editor's Choice award.andM;Then factor in that ours are bidirectional I/O ports, that each can be setindependently for serial or parallel operation, and that a separate thirdport is included for networking the Systemizer together, and further value isadded per port.andP;  Tim Wilde President Applied Creative Technology Inc. Dallas,TexasandM;WANTED: A FEW GOOD UTILITIESandM;I would like to echo the sentiment expressed by A. Leyder (Letters, PCMagazine, September 12, 1989).andP;  I (and likely many other corporate readers)am faced with similar choices.andP;  I don't have time to type in these greatutilities you offer, nor is my company willing to allow me a PC MagNetaccount.andP;  I know that $10 to $15 for an occasional utilities disk updatewould be no problem.andP;  Meanwhile, mark me as another &quot;faithful but frustrated&quot;reader.andP;  James Eddy Hartford, Connecticut</TEXT></DOC>
