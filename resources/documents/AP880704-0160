(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Solar energy and fuels made from crops canhelp combat the ``greenhouse effect'' that some scientists claim ispartly responsible for this year's drought, say officials at theSolar Energy Research Institute.   But scientists at the institute caution that it will takeseveral decades to reverse damage already done to the environment.   ``There is no quick fix. That's one of the very scary thingsabout global weather change,'' said Dr. Tom Bathe, manager ofSERI's office of analysis and evaluation.   Scientists say the ``greenhouse effect'' is caused by pollutantscreated by the burning of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide representsabout half of the pollutants; other gasses such as nitrous oxideand methane comprise the rest.   The pollutants create an envelope around the Earth that does notallow reflected heat to leave the atmosphere and causestemperatures to grow warmer.   James Hansen, climatologist at NASA's Goddard Institute of SpaceSciences, told the Senate Energy Committee recently that the``greenhouse effect'' will make droughts like this year's morelikely.   He and other scientists have said that 1988 is likely to set arecord for global average temperatures. Scientists have observedthat the four hottest years to date globally all have occurred inthe 1980s.   Worst-case scenarios by scientists show average temperaturesrising 3 to 9 degrees by the middle of the next century and seasrising about a foot as the polar icecaps melt.   ``Even if we were able to shut off all the carbon dioxide andmethane produced today, we would still face significant change'' inthe world's weather because of the existing `greenhouse,''' Bathesaid.   Congress created SERI when oil prices shot up in the 1970s. Itsmission was to find clean energy sources that would be alternativesto fossil fuels. Staff and budget cuts during the Reaganadministration have taken a toll on the agency, but its scientistsare continuing their research.   Some SERI proposals for curbing the ``greenhouse effect''include:   _Widespread use of biomass liquid fuels from crops. The cropswould absorb as much carbon dioxide while they are being grown asthey would produce when burned as transportation fuels.   _Use of photovoltaic cells _ man-made silicon chips thatchemically convert natural light to electricity _ to replace fossilfuel-fired power plants.   _Using thermal systems _ which convert heat captured directlyfrom the sun _ to replace fossil-fuel heat sources.   Although coal is the biggest carbon dioxide producer among thefossil fuels, ``everybody expects coal to be the most rapidlyexpanding component'' in the future, Bathe said.</TEXT></DOC>
