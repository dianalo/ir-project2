But for Eisele, a writer and co-producer of CBS' ``TheEqualizer,'' it's also been a time for frugal living and a returnto earlier pastimes of writing poetry and plays.   ``I'm coping financially because I was raised in a sort ofaustere middle class existence,'' he said. ``I've always beenfrugal with my money. I've never lived beyond my means. I knew whenI got into this industry in 1980 that it had a history of longstrikes, so I saved my money and bought a house I could afford.   ``I can pay the mortgage. I can hold out for a long time. But Ihave writer friends who are not so lucky. I'm going to look at afriend's sideboard that he's selling to pay the rent,'' he said.   As a ``hyphenate,'' the industry term for a person who performsseveral jobs, in his case writing and producing, Eisele's salarywas ``in the neighborhood'' of $200,000 to $400,000 a year.   The average writer who does not have a regular job and dependson free-lance sales makes considerably less and the median incomeof working members of the Writers Guild of America is $43,000 ayear. At any given time, only about half of the guild's 9,000members are employed.   The strike began March 7 over the issue of payments for rerunsof one-hour domestic television shows and a bigger share in theincreased foreign market.   ``We are very well paid, but we also create the product,'' hesaid. ``We are first among equals. Without our vision no one elsecan go to work. I think because we do create the work we should becompensated with residuals.''   ``The Equalizer,'' which has completed its third year on CBS, isnow a viable show for syndication.   ``If a show is syndicated, then every episode I've written willbring in a certain amount of residuals over the years,'' he said.``It becomes an annuity for a writer.''   ``They want rollbacks in some areas but they aren't flexible inthe area of foreign residuals,'' Eisele said. ``The foreign marketis growing. There's going to be an explosion in the foreign marketfor television.''   Eisele was playwright-in-residence at the American ConservatoryTheatre in San Francisco in 1975-76. His first film work was alow-budget movie called ``Breach of Contract,'' which starred PeterCoyote and Cindy Pickett.   In 1985 his friends Terry Louise Fisher and Steve Brown askedhim to write a script for CBS' ``Cagney andamp; Lacey.'' His script,called ``Ordinary Hero,'' won the Humanitas Award for 60-minutedrama.   He wrote the first show for the 1986-87 season for ``Cagney andamp;Lacey.'' He was story editor of NBC's ``Crime Story'' before goingto ``The Equalizer'' this past season as co-producer.   During the strike he has written a script for PBS' ``AmericanPlayhouse'' called ``Last Light,'' the story of the relationshipbetween a condemned man and a prison guard. Public television isnot affected by the strike.   He also is outlining a new play and has brought out some of hispoetry, to give it a polish and send it off to various journals.   ``I'm getting by because I've always had an old working boy'soutlook,'' he said. ``I've never tried to impress people with mywealth, not that I have any. I don't take to the Hollywood glitz.''</TEXT></DOC>
