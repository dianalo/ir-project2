To do so, the government must convince Argentine citizens that while the five-day crisis produced results that satisfied many of the rebels' demands, Mr. Alfonsin emerged as the winner.    Mr. Alfonsin certainly appeared victorious when he accepted the surrender of the rebel officers on Sunday night. He proved that he is a master politician with the capacity to transform the most difficult situation into personal triumph.    But the replacement yesterday of Gen. Hector Rios Erenu as army chief of staff and the expectation that the responsibility of lower-ranking officers for acts committed during the 1976-1982 war against subversion will be limited suggest that, in the end, the rebels were recognized as representatives of positions too widely held in the armed forces to be disregarded.    The resignation of Gen. Rios Erenu, and the reorganization of the army command that is likely to ensue, is the most easily explained of the apparent rebel gains.    The crisis was drawn out because of the inability of the army high command to provide troops sufficiently loyal to the government to repress the revolt. Long-simmering discontent with the policies of the chief of staff, who lower-ranking officers believed betrayed them by not firmly resisting the right of civilian courts to try them, left Mr. Alfonsin &quot;without a single soldier,&quot; said military analyst Juan Bautista Jofre. The departure of Gen. Rios Erenu therefore was inevitable.    Mr. Alfonsin last night named Gen. Jose Dante Caridi to succeed Gen. Erenu as army chief of staff, apparently ending the prospect of the forced retirement of at least 10 generals. That would have automatically produced a restructuring of the army command that would have brought it more into line with the rebels' preferences.    There had been speculation that another less-senior general, Gen. Augusto Vidal, would get the post. His appointment would have forced the retirements because Argentine military rules mandate that commanders must have seniority over their subordinates.    According to Mr. Jofre, a reconciliation of the armed forces with the political system wasn't possible as long as the army couldn't speak with one voice.    The widely expected setting of guidelines for human-rights trials that would limit the culpability of lower-ranking military officers is not likely to be so easily explained. This issue has far more popular interest than the organization of the army command, and trials of military officers are set to continue this week, which could keep tensions high.    However, the so-called Democratic Pact signed on Sunday morning by representatives of political parties, trade unions and important economic and social sectors commits virtually the entire leadership of Argentina to a recognition of distinct &quot;levels of responsibility in conduct&quot; in past events.    While the response of the rank and file of the political parties, including the president's own Radical Party, is difficult to judge, the moderation of the views expressed constantly by ordinary citizens throughout last week's crisis are an indication that compromise may have a better chance of being popularly accepted now than at any time during the last three years.    Emilio Mignone, a well-known human rights lawyer, said, &quot;We must accept that Alfonsin's solution to the immediate crisis was the only one possible and recognize that he did not grant an amnesty.&quot; Mr. Mignone said that while human-rights organizations certainly will continue to oppose any limitations on the military trials, the expression of popular anti-militarism during the army rebellion will have an important influence on the conduct of the armed forces in the future.    Other analysts are less certain as to what lessons have been learned by the military. A respected economist expressed the fear that officers have seen that by standing firm, concessions can be extracted. &quot;If this leads to a series of barracks revolts,&quot; he said &quot;we are right back where we started -- the most developed banana republic in Latin America.&quot; There are few such drastic views, but there is little doubt that the government of President Alfonsin is now more subject to military pressures.    Up to now those pressures have led in the direction that the government has wanted to go. The limitation of responsibility before the law for military men of lower rank has been a position held by Mr. Alfonsin since before he was elected.    Should that coincidence cease to be the case, solutions will be more difficult than they were before or during the latest rebellion. As Andres Fontana, an expert on the Argentine military, said, &quot;We have never known what we want to do with the military.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
