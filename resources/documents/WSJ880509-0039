Over whiskey and peanuts at a rooftop bar, they tell a reporter that they are here to explore whether the Soviet Union should apply for full membership alongside the 47 nations now in the ADB. &quot;We do not expect to come here as the ADB's favorite child,&quot; explains the bespectacled, young Mr. Atchkassov. &quot;But we do not expect to come here as a bastard.&quot; A singer croons, &quot;There's a place for us.&quot;    Strange scenes are nothing new at the ADB, which for years has fostered central planning in the name of economic development. But the prospect of Soviet membership puts the final, absurd twist on the mission charted for the bank when it was set up in 1966. The ADB was meant to help stop the spread of communism in Asia by promoting economic growth. President Johnson outlined the vision in a famous 1965 speech, citing the potential for rural electrification in the Mekong Delta.    Today, while the U.S. and Japan are considering new aid, such as a &quot;Marshall Plan&quot; to help quash the communist insurgency in the Philippines, the ADB illustrates how economic-aid schemes can backfire. Since the ADB set up shop in Manila in 1966, it has lent $22 billion for some 800 projects. Most have been large state-run programs for building roads, power plants and irrigation systems. The bank's other thrust has been import substitution: a discredited policy of promoting protected industries such as state-owned paper mills in Nepal. The agenda for the 1,500 delegates and businessmen at the bank's meeting late last month was the expansion of the ADB's own clout and bureaucracy.    This agenda goes beyond raising ADB lending levels above last year's record $2.4 billion, or moving the 1,600 staffers into bigger headquarters next year. It goes beyond, say, grants for &quot;institutional strengthening&quot; of socialist Burma's Ministry of Energy. It requires -- by the bank's own inertia and its continuing search for a mission -- warming up to the Russians and their puppet government in Afghanistan, kowtowing to Communist China at the expense of Taiwan, and increasing aid to Vietnamese-occupied Laos.    The ADB's agenda, moreover, poses an affront to the so-called Baker Plan outlined by the American Treasury secretary in 1985 at Seoul. The Baker Plan called for parceling out developmental aid only if borrowers pursue free-market reforms to encourage private enterprise. This has caused a spat over ADB policy between the bank's leading members, the U.S. and Japan. Tokyo is using its overvalued yen to press for big state projects -- which lend themselves to large business contracts. So five experts have been appointed to explore new dimensions in ADB lending. Their report is due late this year.    Unfortunately, the U.S.-Japan squabble begs the real problems. For one thing, ADB aid to the &quot;private sector&quot; does not always involve what is normally viewed as private enterprise. For example, the bank's 1987 annual report lists under &quot;Private Sector Assistance Activities&quot; a $100 million credit line to the state-owned China Investment Bank of the People's Republic, and a $200 million loan to Pakistan's state-controlled banking sector.    So far the only loan tied to policy reform is a recently approved $150 million package for Indonesia. The money will reimburse the Indonesian central bank for foreign-exchange reserves drawn down in developing nontraditional exports. Under this loan, say, the ADB could help pay for the importation of plastics raw materials. That happens to be a state-licensed monopoly in Indonesia.    There is an argument that because the ADB's real purpose is not just economic but political it's worth marginally warping markets. The ADB helps keep open what its president, Masao Fujioka, calls the &quot;policy dialogue.&quot; But politics at the ADB appears to be a losing game too.    The People's Republic of China was admitted as a member two years ago. Not least among the reasons was the communist mainland's vast capacity for swallowing resources; it offers the prospect of keeping ADB bureaucrats employed for generations. To win this work the ADB degraded the name of one of its charter members, the rival Republic of China -- calling it &quot;Taipei, China.&quot; For two years, Taiwan boycotted the meetings. This year Taiwan delegates attended &quot;under protest.&quot; Next year the ADB will force the Taiwan-mainland issue further by holding its annual meeting in Beijing.    Communist Vietnam, which was voted a full member the year after the fall of Saigon, demanded a resumption of the ADB aid suspended after the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978. The Vietnamese puppet government in Laos already has received almost $50 million in soft loans these past two years and has been promised at least $100 million more. ADB projects in Laos include aid to state forestry projects so that logs can be sold abroad by the state export monopoly.    Afghanistan's representative, Mohamad Kabir, asked the ADB to let the Soviets join. He also asked the bank to resume the aid suspended after his country was &quot;confronted with a compelled war for nine years.&quot; Mr. Fujioka confirmed that the bank is &quot;monitoring developments&quot; in Vietnam and Afghanistan -- presumably with an eye to resuming aid.    Mr. Fujioka met with the Soviet observers, but &quot;can't disclose what I discussed.&quot; A few guesses can be gleaned from the talk of the Soviet observers themselves. Says Mr. Mozhaiskov, if the Soviet Union joins, &quot;it would be as a donor. But the concept of donor, it might be stretched rather widely.&quot;    Rather widely, indeed. ADB member nations need plunk down up front only a small fraction of the equity they put into the bank. The money the bank actually lends is borrowed on commercial markets in such places as Tokyo and New York and backed by &quot;callable capital&quot; the member countries promise to provide if needed to pay back these loans. This means the people who will get stuck for the huge loans the bank is making -- loans on which the borrowers will likely default, as the World Bank is starting to learn -- are the taxpayers in the hard-currency countries. This means, for practical purposes, the U.S. and Japan.    By putting up almost no capital the Soviets could manage to get their agents hired onto the staff. That would give them a license to roam Asia on the ADB payroll, carrying the badge of a multilateral organization that hands out loans averaging $47 million apiece. It would be a lot cheaper for Moscow than such recent ploys as paying for fishing rights off the Pacific islands of Vanuatu. Instead, Russians might even get paid by the West to work on the ADB's Vanuatu port project. The prospect delights the Soviet bankers in the rooftop bar. Swirling his drink, Mr. Atchkassov reels off a list of countries where he's done business in recent years: Afghanistan, Cambodia, Nicaragua and much of Africa. &quot;Just remember,&quot; says Mr. Mozhaiskov, &quot;what we have done for developing countries.&quot;    ---   Miss Rosett is editorial-page editor of The Asian Wall Street Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
