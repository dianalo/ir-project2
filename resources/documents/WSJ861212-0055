SeibStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/12/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTAEROSPACE (ARO)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><DATELINE> TEL AVIV  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, handling simultaneous crises over arms sales to Iran and violence among Palestinians, says he doesn't regret the Iranian operation and isn't surprised by the Palestinian uprising.    In an interview yesterday, Mr. Rabin asserted that despite the uproar the operation has caused, Israel doesn't have second thoughts about helping arrange secret U.S. arms sales to Iran.    &quot;I support the purpose that the U.S. and Israel saw in the operation -- the strategic one -- and I'm not ignoring the question of hostages,&quot; Mr. Rabin said. Israel, he added, hasn't ever adopted a policy banning deals with terrorists under all circumstances. &quot;And in this case it wasn't a deal with terrorists, but with a country that has got influence over terrorism,&quot; he said.    Although the U.S. is caught up in the Iran controversy, a more pressing problem for Mr. Rabin is the sudden surge in clashes between Israeli soldiers and young Palestinians on the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The West Bank violence began Dec. 4 when Israeli soldiers shot two students during a demonstration at Bir Zeit University. Each day since then, violent demonstrations have taken place throughout the occupied territories.    Four young Palestinians have been killed and more than a dozen wounded by gunfire during the protests.    The methods Israeli soldiers have used to control the violence have been criticized by the United Nations, and the U.S. has expressed concern.    Mr. Rabin said the violence has been inspired by radical Palestinians alarmed by Israel's recently improved relations with Egypt and its growing tacit cooperation with Jordan in decisions affecting the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Radical Arabs want to disrupt Israel's relationship with Egypt and Jordan and have been working to inspire Palestinian unrest that might block the progress, he said.    After Israel improved its working relations with Egypt and Jordan, Mr. Rabin said, he had expected &quot;to see reaction on the part of the radical Arab countries and the terror organizations, especially the Palestinian terror organizations.&quot;    The disturbances have illustrated that nationalist sentiment and emotional support for the Palestine Liberation Organization remain high on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, despite the PLO's declining stature in the Arab world and the attempts by Jordan and Israel to replace PLO influence on the West Bank with Jordanian influence.    He added that a &quot;prolonged period of tranquility&quot; and improvement of the quality of life of Palestinians will be required to diminish the influence of the PLO and outside political groups.    But the defense minister said Israel's army hasn't adopted tougher or more violent tactics for dealing with Palestinian demonstrators, as some critics say. &quot;I'm fully backing the way that the army handled it,&quot; he said.    Mr. Rabin also expressed confidence that Israel could continue to gradually improve ties with Egypt, which recently agreed to a plan to send a border dispute with Israel to international arbitration. </TEXT></DOC>
