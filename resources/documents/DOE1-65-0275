These levels were highest in the areasof the facility where edgers and glue spray booth operators worked. Theauthor concludes that solvent exposures in these locations posed a potentialhealth hazard. The carpal tunnel syndrome complaints appear to be relatedto ergonomic factors. The author recommends the substitution of less-toxicmaterials in the workplace; applying proper engineering controls; improvinglocal-exhaust ventilation; providing protective clothing for workers;sampling of employees for organic solvent exposure at regular intervals;and informing the employees of all hazards inherent in their work.</TEXT></DOC>
