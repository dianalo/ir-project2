Toprovide a summary of their micrositing experiences, a developer was selectedfor the Altamont Pass and for San Gorgonio Pass areas of California thathad developed and were currently operating wind power stations. The mostcommon wind turbine micrositing methodology used by private wind developersis the field measurement method. A number of anemometer units are placedin the field and augmented by TALA kite measurements to estimate thespatial variation of the wind field. These data are then used to determineturbine energy production from specific turbine sites. Data from actualturbine micrositing experience by a private developer is presented toestimate the accuracy of the field measurement method of wind turbinemicrositing. An attempt to compare the accuracy of the field measurementmethod, the physical wind tunnel model method, and the numerical computermodel method of estimating the spatial variation of the wind resourcefor wind turbine micrositing is also presented.</TEXT></DOC>
