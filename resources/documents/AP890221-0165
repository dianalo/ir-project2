The White House Office of Management Budget released figuresTuesday showing, among other assumptions:   _long-term interest rates falling 3 percent in two years to thelowest point in 20 years.   _savings and loan deposits growing at an annual rate of 7.2percent even as the government will be curbing high-flying,fast-growing institutions.   ``These assumptions are highly optimistic, exceedinglyoptimistic,'' said Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst inAlexandria, Va. ``They're just not realistic.''   If the administration's interest rate projections are off, thegovernment will have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more ayear to finance the borrowing.   If the deposit growth is lower than predicted, then insurancepremiums paid by the industry will fall far short of the $32 billionprojected over the next decade. That will mean taxpayers will haveto pay more.   Bush's plan calls for raising $50 billion by selling bonds overthe next three years. The bonds will be sold in an off-budgetarrangement, which means the government will have to pay more ininterest than on normal Treasury borrowing.   The OMB plan shows the special Sandamp;L bonds carrying a rate 0.3percentage points higher than long-term Treasury rates. That's ``ashade optimistic,'' according to Robert Litan, a banking expert withthe Brookings Institution.   More importantly, however, the government shows long-termTreasury rates falling from about 9.2 percent now to 6.2 percent in1991, which would be the lowest rate since 1968.   ``To say that that's optimistic is the understatement of theyear,'' Litan said.   Analysts said the deposit projections are in line with the growthrate of the past 10 years, but are likely too high if theadministration follows through with other parts of its reformprogram. Sandamp;Ls under the Bush plan would not be allowed to growunless their owners put up more of their own money.   ``There's no way thrift deposits are going to grow that fast inlight of the capital requirements,'' Ely said.   He also said the interest rate projections imply a very low rateof inflation and, in the unlikely event that occurred, it would makeit much harder to meet the deposit growth targets.   Meanwhile, the House Banking Committee on Tuesday looked atrequiring independent certified public accountants hired byindividual Sandamp;Ls to exchange information with federal regulators onwhatever they uncover in their audits.   The committee was reviewing a General Accounting Office check of11 failed Sandamp;Ls in Texas which found that accounting firms, includingsome of the nation's largest, failed to uncover problems in six ofthe 11.   While the six institutions showed a net worth of $44 million inthe independent accountants' audits, their net worth five to 17months later when they failed was a negative $1.5 billion, saidAssistant Comptroller General Frederick D. Wolf.   The committee's chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, saidthe Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the Sandamp;L industry,should have uncovered the audit problems long ago.   ``Of the six audits found deficient by the GAO _ and theseinclude some of the most renowned horror stories _ the bank boardhas not taken action against a single one,'' he said.   In another development, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., who headsthe House subcommittee overseeing Sandamp;Ls, said the Federal DepositInsurance Corp., which insures commercial bank deposits, may be toooverworked to take on oversight the Sandamp;L industry.   As part of the president's reform proposal, the FDIC would getjurisdiction over nearly 3,000 Sandamp;Ls. However, Annunzio, who isfighting to keep Sandamp;L regulation separate from bank regulation, saidthe FDIC in the last two years has not conducted on-site safety andsoundness examinations at hundreds of commercial banks under itsoversight.   ``With over 200 bank failures last year ... we should be steppingup the number and frequency of bank ... examinations. Instead, theBush plan will saddle the insurer of deposits in these banks withsignificant new responsibilities,'' he complained.</TEXT></DOC>
