Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to a heat exchanger, and more particularly to      a heat exchanger having a large heat-transfer area even in a limited space      for installation of the heat exchanger. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 14 and 15 show typycal conventional heat exchangers (which may, for      example, be condensers) which require the heat exchange between a heat      medium (for example, cooling medium) flowing in the heat exchangers and      the air passing through the heat exchangers. In a heat exchanger 100      (condenser) shown in FIG. 14, a flat heat-transfer tube 101 extends in a      serpentine form, and corrugate radiation fins 102 are disposed between the      parallel portions of the serpentine tube. An inlet header pipe 103 is      connected to one end of flat heat-transfer tube 101. An outlet header pipe      104 is connected to the other end of the flat heat-transfer tube. In a      heat exchanger 200 (condenser) shown in FIG. 15, a plurality of flat,      parallel heat-transfer tubes 201 are provided between a pair of parallel      header pipes 202 and 203, and corrugate fins 204 are provided on the sides      of the flat heat-transfer tubes. An inlet tube 205 is connected to header      pipe 202 for introducing a cooling medium into the header pipe. An outlet      tube 206 is connected to header pipe 203 for delivering the cooling medium      out from the header pipe. </PAR><PAR>  In any one of such conventional condensers, an increase of the      heat-exchange ability (i.e., the condensation ability of the condenser) is      required for reducing the energy consumption of a compressor provided in a      refrigerating cycle. One method for increasing this ability is to increase      the length of the condenser in its air flow direction, namely, in its      thickness direction, to thereby increase the heat-transfer area thereof. </PAR><PAR>  In the heat exchanger shown in FIG. 15, however, if the size in the      thickness direction Z of flat heat-transfer tubes 201 of the heat      exchanger is enlarged to increase its heat-exchange ability, under the      condition in that the total width W is restricted within a limited value      (for example, as illustrated by the broken line in FIG. 16), the air      flowable area is reduced from A1 to A2 because the diameters of header      pipes 202 and 203 also become correspondingly larger with the enlargement      of the size of the flat heat-transfer tubes. Such a reduction of the air      flowable area causes the heat-exchange ability of the heat exchanger to be      greatly decreased. Therefore, even if the heat-transfer area of flat      heat-transfer tubes 201 can be enlarged, the potential for increasing the      total heat-exchange ability of the heat exchanger is small due to the      decrease of the air flowable area. </PAR><PAR>  Moreover, in the heat exchanger shown in FIG. 14 or 15, because the pipes      103 and 104 or tubes 205 and 206 must be positioned within respective      small restricted areas, the degree of design freedom for the positions      thereof is very small. Therefore, the design of pipes or tubes to be      connected to pipes 103 and 104 or tubes 205 and 206 is also restricted in      position. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a heat      exchanger which can increase its heat-transfer area without increasing the      diameters of its header pipes, and thereby increase the total      heat-exchange ability of the heat exchanger. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the present invention is to provide a heat exchanger      which has great design freedom with respect to the positions of its inlet      tube and outlet tube. </PAR><PAR>  To achieve these objects, a heat exchanger according to the present      invention is herein provided. The heat exchanger comprises a plurality of      heat-exchanger cores each having a pair of header pipes extending in      parallel relation to each other, a plurality of flat heat-transfer tubes      disposed between the pair of header pipes in parallel relation to one      another and connected to an comunicating with the pair of header pipes at      their end portions, and a plurality of fins provided on the sides of the      flat heat-transfer tubes, wherein the plurality of heat-exchanger cores      are integrally assembled in parallel relation to one another; means for      connecting and communicating between one of the pair of header pipes of a      heat-exchanger core of the plurality of heat-exchanger cores and one of      the pair of header pipes of another heat-exchanger core of the plurality      of heat-exchanger cores; an inlet tube for a heat medium connected to an      communicating with one of the pair of header pipes of at least one of the      plurality of heat-exchanger cores; and an outlet tube for the heat medium      connected to and communicating with another one of the pair of header      pipes of at least one of the plurality of heat-exchanger cores. </PAR><PAR>  In the heat exchanger, a plurality of heat-exchanger cores are integrally      assembled in parallel relation to one another. The connecting and      communicating means communicates between a header pipe of one      head-exchanger core and a header pipe of another heat-exchanger core. The      heat medium flows from the inlet tube to the outlet tube through the      heat-transfer tubes and header pipes of each heat exchanger core and the      connecting and communicating means. Since a plurality of heat-exchanger      cores are integrally assembled, the heat-transfer area of the heat      exchanger can be increased substantially proportionally by the number of      the heat-exchanger cores, even though each heat-exchanger core has      substantially the same o similar size as a conventional single heat      exchanger. Therefore, it is unnecessary to increase the diameter of the      header pipes when the heat exchanger is designed, and the heat-exchange      ability can be greatly increased. </PAR><PAR>  Moreover, since the inlet tube and the outlet tube can be provided on      different heat-exchanger cores, the positions of the tubes can be selected      with a great degree of design freedom, almost independently from each      other. For example, the inlet and outlet tubes can be disposed on the same      side of the heat exchanger, on different sides of the heat exchanger, at      the same height, or at different heights. Furthermore, the plurality of      heat-exchanger cores can be substantially the same size or different sizes     . </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  Some preferred exemplary embodiments of the invention will now be described      with reference to the accompanying drawings which are given by way of      example only, and thus are not intended to limit the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a heat exchanger according to a first      embodiment of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is an enlarged partial vertical sectional view of the heat exchanger      shown in FIG. 1, taken along line II--II of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is an enlarged partial perspective view of the heat exchanger shown      in FIG. 1 as viewed from arrow III of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a partial perspective view of a heat exchanger according to a      modification of the heat exchanger shown in FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a schematic plan view of the heat exchanger shown in FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a schematic plan view of the heat exchanger shown in FIG. 1      illustrating a flow of a heat medium and an air flow. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a schematic plan view of a heat exchanger according to a second      embodiment of the present invention illustrating a flow of a heat medium      and an air flow. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a schematic plan view of a heat exchanger according to a third      embodiment of the present invention illustrating a flow of a heat medium      and an air flow. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a partial vertical sectional view of a heat exchanger according      to a modification of the heat exchanger shown in FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is a perspective view of a heat exchanger according to a fourth      embodiment of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 is perspective view of a heat exchanger according to a fifth      embodiment of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 is a schematic side view of a heat exchanger mounted on an      automobile according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 13 is a schematic plan view of a heat exchanger mounted on an      automobile according to an seventh embodiment of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 14 is a perspective view of a conventional heat exchanger. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 15 is a perspective view of another conventional heat exchanger. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 16 is a schematic plan view of the heat exchanger shown in FIG. 15. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE 1NVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Referring to the drawings, FIGS. 1-3 and FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate a heat      exchanger according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In      FIGS. 1 and 2, a heat exchanger 1 has two heat-exchanger cores 10 and 20      which are integrally assembled in parallel relation to each other. Front      heat-exchanger core 10 comprises a pair of header pipes 11 and 12      extending in parallel relation to each other, a plurality of flat      heat-transfer tubes 13 disposed between the header pipes in parallel      relation to one another and connected to and communicating with the header      pipes at their end portions, a plurality of corrugate type radiation fins      14 provided on the sides of the flat heat-transfer tubes and an inlet tube      15 for a heat medium (in this embodiment, a cooling medium) connected to      and communicating with header pipe 11 at its upper side portion.      Similarly, rear heat-exchanger core 20 comprises a pair of header pipes 21      and 22, a plurality of flat heat-transfer tubes 23, a plurality of      corrugate type radiation fins 24 and an outlet tube 25 for the heat medium      connected to and communicating with header pipe 21 at its upper side      portion. </PAR><PAR>  In this embodiment, heat-exchanger cores 10 and 20 are substantially the      same size (i.e. the same height, the same width and the same thickness),      and inlet tube 15 and outlet tube 25 are disposed on the same side of the      respective heat-exchanger cores. </PAR><PAR>  Two heat-exchanger cores 10 and 20 are arranged in parallel relation to      each other such that a datum plane L1--L1 of heat-exchanger core 10 and a      datum plane L2--L2 of heat-exchanger core 20 are parallel to each other.      In this embodiment, two heat-exchanger cores 10 and 20 are integrally      assembled basically by brazing the portions of the header pipes      confronting each other. Each flat heat-transfer tube 13 of heat-exchanger      core 10 and each corresponding flat heat-transfer tube 23 of      heat-exchanger core 20 are disposed at the same level in height.      Additionally, each fin 14 of heat-exchanger core 10 and each corresponding      fin 24 of heat-exchanger core 20 are disposed at the same level in height.      Therefore, an air path 16 (FIG. 2) for an air flow 17 (FIG. 5) is formed      between adjacent flat heat-transfer tubes 13 and between adjacent flat      heat-transfer tubes 23 through corrugate radiation fins 14 and 24. </PAR><PAR>  The corrugate radiation fins may be constructed as common radiation fins 31      extending between heat-exchanger cores 10 and 20 as shown in FIG. 9. In      such a structure, heat-exchanger cores 10 and 20 are more rigidly      integrated. </PAR><PAR>  Header pipe 12 of heat-exchanger core 10 and header pipe 22 of      heat-exchanger core 20 are connected to and communicated with each other      by a communication tube 18 at their lower portions as shown in FIG. 3.      This communication means may alternatively be constructed of a      communication pipe 30 as shown in FIG. 4. </PAR><PAR>  A cooling medium is introduced from inlet tube 15 into header pipe 11,      flows in heat-exchanger core 10 through flat heat-transfer tubes 13 in an      appropriate serpentine flow between header pipes 11 and 12, and reaches a      position 19 of header pipe 12 where communication tube 18 is provided. The      cooling medium then flows from header pipe 12 into header pipe 22 through      communication tube 18. The cooling medium transferred to heat-exchanger      core 20 flows through flat heat-transfer tube 23 in an appropriate      serpentine flow between header pipes 21 and 22, reaches the position of      outlet tube 25, and flows out from the outlet tube. The cooling medium      introduced from inlet tube 15 is gradually condensed during the described      passage, and the condensed cooling medium is delivered to other equipment      in a refrigerating cycle (not shown). Corrugate radiation fins 14 and 24      accelerate the condensation of the cooling medium. The cooling medium may      flow from header pipe 11 to header pipe 12 in a parallel flow through all      flat heat-transfer tubes 13. In heat-exchanger core 20, the cooling medium      may flow from header pipe 22 to header pipe 21 in a similar parallel flow. </PAR><PAR>  In such a heat exchanger, as shown in FIG. 5, an air flowable area A1 can      have the same width as that of the conventional single heat exchanger      shown in FIG. 15 (illustrated by the broken line in FIG. 5), because it is      not necessary to increase the diameters of the header pipes in comparison      with those of the conventional heat exchanger. Therefore, the air flowable      area of heat exchanger 1 can retain a sufficiently large area while the      heat-transfer area of the heat exchanger, due to flat heat-transfer tubes      13 and 23, can be increased to an area substantially two times the area of      the conventional single heat exchanger. As a result, the total      heat-exchange ability of heat exchanger 1 can be increased to a very great      extent. </PAR><PAR>  Moreover, in this embodiment, since inlet tube 15 and outlet tube 25 are      positioned at the same side of heat exchanger 1 and at the same height,      tubes or pipes to be connected to the inlet and outlet tubes can be easily      and conveniently connected thereto. Further, the space for the above tubes      or pipes around heat exchanger 1 can be greatly saved. </PAR><PAR>  Three flows of the cooling medium P can be considered as shown in FIGS.      6-8. </PAR><PAR>  In the above embodiment, the cooling medium flows from front heat-exchanger      core 10 to rear heat-exchanger core 20 in accordance with air flow 17 as      shown in FIG. 6. In a second embodiment shown in FIG. 7, the cooling      medium flows simultaneously in heat-exchanger cores 41 and 42 in a      parallel flow. In this embodiment, a header block 43 is provided for      connecting and communicating with header pipes 44 and 45. An inlet tube 46      is connected to the header block 43. The introduced cooling medium is      distributed to header pipes 44 and 45 by the header block 43. Similarly, a      header block 47 is also provided for connecting and communicating with      header pipes 48 and 49. An outlet tube 50 is connected to the header block      47. The joined cooling medium in the header block 47 is directed out of      the heat exchanger by the outlet tube 50. In a third embodiment shown in      FIG. 8, the cooling medium flows from rear heat-exchanger core 51 to front      heat-exchanger core 52 in accordance with air flow 17. </PAR><PAR>  In the above three flows of the cooling medium, the radiation ability of      the flow shown in FIG. 6 is the highest, followed by the flow shown in      FIG. 7. Therefore, the flow of the cooling medium is preferably begun on      the upstream side of the air flow. However, the flow shown in FIG. 7 is      desirable for limiting pressure loss of the cooling medium flow. </PAR><PAR>  In the above flow systems shown in FIGS. 6 and 8, a header block 61 may be      applied as shown in FIG. 10 as a fourth embodiment of the present      invention. An inlet tube 62 and an outlet tube 63 are both connected to      header block 61. The cooling medium introduced from inlet tube 62 flows      into header pipe 11 through header block 61 and the condensed cooling      medium from header pipe 21 flows out from outlet tube 63 through the      header block. The structure of the inlet and outlet portions can thereby      be simplified. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 illustrates a fifth embodiment of the present invention. In this      embodiment, a front heat-exchanger core 71 is shorter in height than a      rear heat-exchanger core 72. An inlet tube 73 is connected to front      heat-exchanger core 71 and an outlet tube 74 is connected to rear      heat-exchanger core 72. Thus, the integrally assembled heat-exchanger      cores can have different heights, and the positions (heights) of inlet      tube 73 and outlet tube 74 can be set to adequate positions as needed. </PAR><PAR>  Further, the number of heat-exchanger cores integrally assembled as a heat      exchanger may be increased. In a sixth embodiment shown in FIG. 12, a heat      exchanger 81 is mounted in a front portion of an engine room of an      automobile. Heat exchanger 81 comprises three heat-exchanger cores 82, 83      and 84 having respective heights H1, H2 and H3 different from one another.      The inside space of the engine room can be efficiently utilized for      installation of heat exchanger 81. </PAR><PAR>  Furthermore, the width of a plurality of heat-exchanger cores constituting      a heat exchanger according to the present invention may be changed so that      the heat-exchanger cores have different widths relative to one another.      FIG. 13 illustrates a seventh embodiment of the present invention. A heat      exchanger 91 is mounted in an engine room of an automobile and comprises      three heat-exchanger cores 92, 93 and 94 having respective widths W1, W2      and W3 different from one another. </PAR><PAR>  In the above embodiments, the plurality of heat-exchanger cores may be      different from one another in height and width. Thus, the heat-exchanger      cores constituting a heat exchanger according to the present invention can      have different sizes as needed. The positions of the inlet and outlet      tubes of the heat exchanger can also be decided to required positions. </PAR><PAR>  Although several preferred embodiments of the present invention have been      described herein in detail, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the      art that various modifications and alterations can be mode to these      embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and      advantages of this invention. Accordingly, it is to be understood that all      such modifications and alterations are included within the scope of the      invention as defined by the following claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
