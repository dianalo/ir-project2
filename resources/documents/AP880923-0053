With the first of two nationally televised debates just two daysaway, Dukakis and Bush cleared their schedules today to pore overbriefing books and confer with staff and advisers on Sunday'sshowdown.   Dukakis is engaging in a mock debate and meeting with New JerseySen. Bill Bradley. The Democratic presidential nominee also wasgetting in a bit of physical exercise with an early morning game ofcatch with Boston Red Sox center fielder Ellis Burks outsideDukakis' Brookline home.   Bush was spending the day cramming at the vice president'sresidence.   Negotiators for the two candidates reached agreement Thursday onthe final logistical obstacle to the debate _ the composition ofthe panel. Jim Lehrer of public television's MacNeil@LehrerNewsHour will moderate the debate in Winston-Salem, N.C., and thepanelists will be ABC News anchor Peter Jennings, Anne Groer of TheOrlando Sentinel and John Mashek of The Atlanta Constitution, thebipartisan commission on debates announced.   While the two presidential candidates limited their appearances,Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle did the same,spending the day in Washington tending to Senate duties.   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen was campaigning in three crucial states _Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania where he was expected to reiteratethe ticket's stands on Social Security, trade and health care.   The Democrats received some encouraging news from a nationalpoll that put the race at essentially a dead heat, but found aslight dip in Bush's support since the week after the RepublicanNational Convention.   The NBC News-Wall Street Journal survey of 2,630 likely votersfound Bush leading 45-41 percent compared with last month's pollshowing Bush ahead 47-40 percent.   The margin of error was plus or minus two percentage points forthe survey, conducted Sept. 16 through Monday.   On Thursday, Dukakis used Bush's visit to the Massachusettsgovernor's home state to criticize the vice president's descriptionof himself as a crimefighter and environmentalist.   ``We're here today to investigate a felony _ assault and batteryon the truth,'' an invigorated Dukakis told a rally outside theMassachusetts statehouse. ``What George Bush is doing to the truthin this campaign is a crime.''   Earlier, Bush had traveled to Boston to pick up an endorsementfrom the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association, a 1,500-memberunion that has consistently supported Republican candidates.   At the rally, Dukakis surrounded himself with police officersfrom several Massachusetts departments as well as law enforcementofficials from Texas, Florida, Michigan and other states.   He then launched into his attack, charging that ``for the pasteight years George Bush has been running with a crowd that wouldn'tknow the rule of law if it hit them in the face.''   Dukakis also said that when Bush toured polluted Boston harborearlier this month to criticize the governor's clean-up efforts,the Republican nominee came ``to impersonate an environmentalist.''   Bush, who received the police union's pledge of support onWednesday, formally accepted the endorsement and charged thatDukakis is soft on crime.   ``I'm here to receive this endorsement but also to make it clearthat I'm the one in this race who wants to strengthen lawenforcement,'' said Bush, who was surrounded by about 50 patrolmen,all elected representatives of the police union.   The leadership of the largest union in New England, inexplaining the Bush endorsement, cited Dukakis' revolving doorpolicy for criminals and his failure to attend the funerals ofthree officers killed in the line of duty.   Dukakis, in his remarks, noted that the suspect in the murder ofone of the officers was a repeat violent offender who had beenparoled from federal prison after serving less than half of aprison term for bank robbery.   ``That's what's going on in the federal system these days, myfriends,'' he said.   After his stop in Boston, Bush joined President Reagan at afund-raiser in Houston, where the vice president pledged that ifelected he will work on reordering U.S. conventional defenses.   Bush's plan, which has been under consideration at the Pentagonfor the past two years, is ``designed to ensure that we need notmatch the Soviets bullet for bullet and tank for tank,'' the vicepresident said.   During the campaign, Dukakis has advocated modernizingconventional forces in Europe.   Reagan told the $3.1 million fund-raiser that the Democrats``use our words and borrow our tune but the song is way out ofkey.'' The president, without mentioning Dukakis' name, also saidthe Democratic nominee flip-flopped on such issues as support forthe B-1 bomber.   Meanwhile, Quayle urged Americans to judge the Soviet Union bywhether the superpower pulls back from ``global `pot stirring''' inAfghanistan, Angola, Nicaragua and other nations.   The Indiana senator also told a Los Angeles audience thatperestroika, or restructuring, in the Soviet Union has yet to liveup to its promise.   Bentsen told a Silicon Valley audience that the Reaganadministration's ``do-nothing'' approach on trade has left theUnited States ``dependent on Japan for 40 percent of the computerchips used in our own weaponry.''</TEXT></DOC>
