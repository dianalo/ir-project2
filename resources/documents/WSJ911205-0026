The IRS has told organizers of both the Mobil Cotton Bowland the John Hancock Bowl that the millions of dollars ofcorporate sponsorship fees they receive are taxable. Inessence, the IRS found that the fees aren't charitablecontributions, but are payments for advertising. If theruling stands, the bowl groups will have to pay some 34% oftheir sponsorship fees in federal taxes.</LP><TEXT>   The IRS stressed that the rulings apply only to the twocases. But marketing executives yesterday said theimplications may be far broader. They said organizers of anynonprofit events, from the Olympics to music festivals tolocal Little League teams, now risk losing a third of theircorporate funding to taxes -- an amount that could bedevastating enough to shut some events down altogether.   &quot;It's really a disaster. I don't think the IRS has a clueof the ramifications of all of this,&quot; says Lesa Ukman, editorof Special Events Report, a newsletter based in Chicago. Sheestimates companies spend $1.1 billion on nonprofit eventseach year.   The sponsors themselves aren't directly affected by theruling. But their sponsorship contributions may no longer bebig enough if event organizers must pay taxes on them. And inthis economic environment, few advertisers can afford to forkover even more.   John Hancock, for example, is a major sponsor of theBoston and New York marathons, as well as its bowl game in ElPaso, Texas, for which it pays $1 million a year to theschools involved. The big insurer &quot;couldn't pay more, and Idon't think {other sponsors} would,&quot; says Jack Mahoney, aHancock sports marketing consultant. If the rulings hold, &quot;alot of events will immediately go out of business, and otherswill be scaled down. In a word, it could be disastrous,&quot; hesays.   The IRS is already examining other nonprofit events todetermine if they, too, should be paying taxes on sponsorshipfees. At least two Olympics federations, the U.S. GymnasticsFederation, and the U.S. Volleyball Association, are targetsof IRS audits, though no rulings have been made. An IRSspokesman won't discuss specifics but acknowledges, &quot;We dohave a number of exempt organizations under examination.&quot;   But the spokesman cautions against too broad a reading ofthe rulings. Only nonprofit events that actively advertisetheir sponsors are at risk, he suggested. Not only do Mobiland John Hancock both get their names in the title of theirbowl games, for example, but Mobil's logo is plastered on thefootball field itself. In such cases, nonprofit organizationsare providing &quot;advertising in exchange for the payment,&quot; thespokesman says.   By contrast, the spokesman notes, royalties paid tononprofit groups aren't taxed. In the case of royalties, thecompany that pays the royalty actually does the advertising.A soft drink, for example, might pay a royalty to an Olympicscommittee for the right to advertise itself as the officialsoft drink of the Olympics.   The IRS is essentially trying to crack down on nonprofitevent organizers who have become more and more cozy withsponsors in recent years. In the past five years, eventorganizers have wooed corporate dollars with promises ofsigns in stadiums, public relations blitzes and even thesponsor's name in lights. The big promises paid off with evenbigger corporate gifts.   Of 18 college bowl games, for example, a dozen now havetitle sponsors. John Hancock was the first to put its monikeron a bowl game in 1986. It has since been joined by, amongothers, the USFandamp;G Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, the FederalExpress Orange Bowl in Miami, and the Poulan/Weed EaterIndependence Bowl in Shreveport, La.   All the bowls together will pay schools a total of about$64 million this year, according to Hancock's Mr. Mahoney,with a substantial portion of that provided by the titlesponsors.   Golf and tennis tournaments, some of which are organizedby nonprofit groups, have also been freely attachingsponsors' names to their titles in return for bigcontributions. Those events could also be jeopardized by therulings, says Ms. Ukman of Special Events Report.   The bowl sponsors, who plan to appeal the IRS rulings,insist they aren't paying for advertising at all. Peter A.Spina, Mobil vice president of public affairs, says thecompany's involvement has to do with community relations andvisibility, not selling a product. &quot;If I had asked Mobilmanagement to spend this money each year to advertise, Iprobably should be fired,&quot; Mr. Spina says. Industryexecutives believe Mobil pays about $1.5 million a year forthe New Year's Day Cotton Bowl.   Naming a sports event for a sponsor, or splashing thesponsor's name over a football field, is the same as puttinga big contributor's name &quot;on a building or a chair at theuniversity,&quot; contends Bruce Bernstien, a tax partner atArthur Andersen who represents the Cotton Bowl AthleticAssociation. &quot;It's the only way a nonprofit can thank a majordonor.&quot;   ---   Gilbert Fuchsberg contributed to this article.   ---   CBS Olympics Promotion                                                                                                          With 17% of the ad time for the 1992 Winter Olympics leftto sell, CBS unveiled a plan that it hopes will make peoplewatch -- million-dollar giveaways with Coca-Cola Co. and ablitz of advertising and promotional spots.   In a &quot;Medals andamp; Millions&quot; contest, Coca-Cola will give away$1 million on each of 16 nights of Olympics coverage fromAlbertville, France. Consumers will get numbered game cardswith Coca-Cola products and watch the Games to see if theirnumbers match the number flashed on the screen duringpromotional breaks shown throughout Olympics coverage.Interpublic Group's McCann-Erickson will handle mediaadvertising for the promotion, including TV, radio and print.In addition, CBS will air a series of 40 promotionalannouncements with the theme, &quot;Share a Moment With theWorld.&quot;   George Schweitzer, CBS senior vice president, said thepromotion would be the largest ever on CBS. He also predictedthe network will be sold out for Olympics ads by the time theGames begin. Mr. Schweitzer said that &quot;we don't anticipatethe need for any write-downs on the Olympics,&quot; despiteindustry speculation that CBS could have a loss of as much as$75 million on the Games.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .                                                                                                          FCB/DIRECT: Widespread employee defections at Foote, Coneandamp; Belding's direct marketing unit were resolved in what thecompany termed an &quot;amicable settlement.&quot; FCB/Direct PresidentJames Tennant and 20 other employees have been rehired, thecompany said. Only Mark Weinstein, former senior vicepresident, was not rehired. The executives resigned last weekto start their own firm, a move Foote Cone countered with arestraining order. Neither Mr. Weinstein nor Mr. Tennantcould be reached for comment.                                                                                                          PEPSICO: Although an agency decision is said to be &quot;monthsaway&quot; for PepsiCo's new tea venture with Unilever's Thomas J.Lipton, Pepsi agency BBDO, a unit of Omnicom Group, appearsto be a likely candidate.
