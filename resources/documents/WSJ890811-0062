At last month's meeting, under pressure from veterans' groups, members of the nine-member Hudson County Board of Freeholders indicated they were prepared to rename the courthouse to protest Justice Brennan's participation in a court ruling that laws against flag-burning are an unconstitutional restraint on freedom of expression.    In a unanimous vote yesterday, the board decided to drop the matter. &quot;We were told the whole world was watching Hudson County,&quot; said freeholder Marilyn Roman. &quot;Aren't we a group of civilized people? We don't want to embarrass Justice Brennan.&quot;    The freeholders were persuaded by members of the local bar association to continue to show respect for the justice, who worked in the building as Hudson County's first assignment judge between 1949 and 1951. Ten lawyers spoke in support of Justice Brennan. Five veterans denounced him.    John Tomasin, a lawyer who is also a veteran, warned: &quot;We have a few people who say, 'Let's be petty and punish the justice.' If we do that we'll go back to the old days, and Hudson County will be treated like idiots and morons.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
