The Commission is publishingthis notice to solicit comment on the rule change.DTC recently expanded its Same-Day Funds Settlement Service to includemedium-term notes as eligible corporate securities. Because of the variableterms of MTN issues and the short turnaround time on MTN issuances (frequentlythey settle on the next-day), DTC in conjunction with the MTN sales agents,has developed a system that provides for book-entry-only issuance and deliveryof the securities. DTC states in its filing that the proposed fees arebased on DTC's costs of providing these services. The underwriting feewill be charged to the sales agent or, in the absence of a sales agent,the issuing agent. These fees are to be effective for services providedafter March 31, 1988.The proposal establishes new fees for the following services:(1) Maintenance of long positions; for each book-entry-only issue a monthlycharge of $0.40 per issue, per month will be charged;(2) Corporate issue underwritings; $205.00 plus $3.00 per million witha total maximum fee of $2,000.00 and any unusual expenses;(3) Book-entry-only issues; $205.00 and any unusual expenses;(4) Certificates of deposit; $105.00 and any unusual expenses; and(5) Medium-term notes; $20.00 for each tranche and any unusual expenses.DTC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirementsof the Act in that it has adopted the proposed rule change pursuant tosection 17A(b)(3)(D) which authorizes it to adopt reasonable fees for theservices which it provides.The rule change has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) ofthe Act. The Commission may summarily abrogate the rule change at any timewithin 60 days of its filing if it appears to the Commission that abrogationis necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protectionof investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.You may submit written comment within 21 days after notice is publishedin the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>Please file six copies of your comment withthe Secretary of the Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549.
