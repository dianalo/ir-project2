In the first precise official report, Tass said its preliminarycount showed 400 of the more than 1,200 people aboard the passengertrains, including many children bound for summer camp, were dead ormissing after Sunday's explosion in the Ural Mountains along theTrans-Siberian Railroad.   ``Military units are searching the adjacent forest and mountainsin the hope that some of the passengers managed to escape thetornado of fire,'' the official news agency said.   The blast was equivalent to the explosion of 10,000 tons of TNT,Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, the Soviet military chief of staff, toldTass.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who visited the remote siteSunday, told the new Soviet parliament ``a few hundred people'' hadbeen killed. He said incompetence and a lack of discipline mighthave contributed to the accident.   Gennady K. Dmitrin, editor of Evening Chelyabinsk, said hisnewspaper has a list of between 500 and 800 people dead. He saidthat list was preliminary.   Dmitrin said children under age 8 did not have train tickets andtherefore were not included in the count Tass gave for the numberof people aboard.   Asked about the death toll given by Dmitrin, Dr. VladimirRuchki, a local Health Ministry spokesman said: ``It's aboutright.'' He said more than 600 people were hospitalized. Tass saidmore than 500 people were hospitalized and that 85 percent sufferedsevere burns.   Moiseyev told Tass the liquefied gas explosion ``had the sameyield as a 10,000-ton bomb and was so powerful that it felled alltrees within 2.5 miles.'' He said the blast hurled two locomotivesand 38 passengers cars from the rails, with most of the carsdestroyed by a one-mile-long blaze. The total number of railroadcars was not known.   ``The picture I saw was terrifying, catastrophic,'' Dmitrinsaid, reading from a correspondent's first-person account publishedin his paper. ``The forest was practically burned to ashes by thefire. Only blackened trunks of trees could be seen. But mosttragic, cars were blackened, twisted and even now exude asuffocating stink.''   A special Aeroflot flight brought 50 of the injured to Moscowfor medical care today. The wounded, their skin blistered andpeeling in places, were loaded on stretchers into waitingambulances.   In Moscow, speaking to Congress, Gorbachev called for a minuteof silence and the 2,250 deputies stood to mourn the victims.Gorbachev then recessed the session for a national day of mourning.   The 58-year-old Soviet leader, in remarks from the Kremlin'sPalace of Congresses broadcast live on radio and television, saidthe 1,153 mile-long pipeline burst a half mile from the rails.   He said the liquefied petroleum gas poured down a slope towardthe tracks for three hours. Despite the leak, pumps were turned onto compensate for the pressure loss.   ``Everything started to accumulate, and when this mass reachedthe level of electrical train contacts, a spark ignited thiscondensed cloud,'' Gorbachev told the deputies.   The two passenger trains _ traveling in opposite directions _had made unscheduled stops near each other between the city of Ufaand the town of Asha, 750 miles southeast of Moscow. One train wason a siding, and the other was on the main tracks, the Sovietpresident indicated.   ``How could it be that again there is incompetence,irresponsibility, mismanagement, disgrace? Comrades and I, and allresidents there, said there will be no progress if we have suchlaxness,'' Gorbachev said.   He said investigators would examine why the gas pump was turnedon despite the leak and why the two trains made unscheduled stopsat the same place.   The busy railroad links the western, European part of thecountry to the Asian region in the east. The trains were travelingbetween Novosibirsk, the largest town in Siberia with a populationof 1.3 million, and Adler, a popular Black Sea resort.   Gorbachev said among the victims was a group of childrentraveling to southern resorts. Tass said 16 severely burnedchildren were taken to the town of Yuryuzan and that ``doctors arestruggling to save their lives.''   ``The whole territory blew up. It was a real hell,'' Gorbachevsaid Sunday in Chelyabinsk, the biggest city near the scene.Television carried his remarks in a special late-night broadcastSunday.   The television showed bloody and blackened faces and limbs ofvictims. One boy lying on a stretcher in an ambulance at theChelyabinsk airport was so scarred the correspondent had to tellviewers, ``He's living.''   The film showed charred railroad cars without windows lying atodd angles amid twisted tracks and protruding railroad ties. Thesurrounding area was blackened and barren.   The blast was so strong it shattered windows in a village sevenmiles away, and incinerated dozens of acres of trees, televisionsaid.   It was the third major Soviet train accident in a year and addedto the disasters during Gorbachev's 4-year-old rule. They includethe Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion, the sinking of acruise ship and a nuclear-armed submarine, and the Armenianearthquake.   Sunday's accident was the worst in the Soviet Union since June4, 1988, when nearly 100 people were killed as three trains loadedwith industrial explosives blew up in Arzamas, 240 miles east ofMoscow.   In the most recent fatal train accident a freight train carryingpropane collided with another freight on May 20 in SovietKazakhstan causing a fire and eplosion that killed five people anddestroyed factories and 13 houses.</TEXT></DOC>
