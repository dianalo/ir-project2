Operating in the depressed oil patch of Oklahoma and Texas and the hardscrabble farm states of Arkansas, Kansas and Missouri, the company posted its poorest telephone-line growth since the Great Depression: fewer than 8,200 new residential lines and an actual reduction of business lines.    But this year, determined to keep history from repeating itself, the company has used a novel marketing tool to expand business among existing corporate customers.    The tool is a $20 million advanced-technology laboratory at headquarters in St. Louis that relies on a strategy of &quot;try it, you'll like it.&quot; Southwestern Bell uses the lab like a toy store, enticing customers to play with the latest hi-tech telephone services and gadgetry -- in hopes that they'll buy some later.    Promotion is temptation: Lab space is free to any corporate customer. So is unlimited use of the lab's expensive computer and telephone equipment, as well as unlimited hours of help from Southwestern Bell technicians in testing the sophisticated services. While teams from customer companies run their experiments and trials, which often take weeks, Southwestern Bell sometimes even picks up the tab for lodging.    To help simulate almost any office environment, the laboratory is equipped with about 15 models of personal computers and sophisticated call-routing switches and other telephone equipment made by leading vendors.    &quot;If we can get customers to test out systems on their own, we have an easier time selling them,&quot; explains Richard W. Stephenson, district manager of the laboratory. &quot;It's a way to impart new technology to our customers.&quot;    So far, the technique is working. Since January, Southwestern Bell has sold about 16,000 new lines to current business customers by introducing them to various features of Integrated Services Digital Network, such as &quot;inspect,&quot; which displays the name and telephone number of the party calling.    Impressed by what they learned in the lab, Tenneco Inc., Shell Oil Co. and Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co. each bought more than 3,000 new lines. For instance, the laboratory experience helped Houston-based Tenneco to decide to buy 3,900 more lines for an advanced network that integrates voice and data traffic.    Before the lab opened, Southwestern Bell salesmen had spent nearly a year trying unsuccessfully to persuade Tenneco to install the advanced network. As a last-ditch effort, they invited Tenneco telecommunications managers to take a brief &quot;tour&quot; of the laboratory.    The skeptical Tenneco team kept asking to fiddle with more systems and gadgetry, and the Southwestern Bell hosts kept accommodating. The hook was set.    Tenneco technicians spent about a month in the lab, experimenting with the network that would link headquarters with six branch buildings scattered around Houston. Russell Roy, Tenneco's telecommunications manager, says his team set up a model system, then began testing day-to-day activities on it. Later, the group examined network services and tested company software on the system.    One feature of the new system, which Tenneco bought and installed last month, allows an employee to use a computer to call up reports that have been transmitted by facsimile machine. The employee can then relay the information to other computers at various Tenneco offices.    &quot;I don't think we would have bought the (ISDN) system without the help of the laboratory,&quot; Mr. Roy says. &quot;We wouldn't have known how to use the data.&quot;    Shell, meanwhile, tested a feature that allows employees at separate offices to &quot;share&quot; computer screens. With the service, employees at different locations can make changes to the same data and see it on their individual screens. Shell bought 5,000 new lines for its system.    Southwestern Bell is encouraged that the lab project is already bearing fruit. &quot;One of the most difficult things for us to sell is a concept -- and that's what a network is,&quot; explains Neal Sharp, the company's technology marketing manager. &quot;The laboratory helps us sell these concepts.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
