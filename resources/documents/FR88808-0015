The Service issued a clarifyingNotice on January 8, 1982, 47 FR 988. The amendments were proposed to conformthe regulations to section 135 of the Revenue Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-600,92 Stat. 2763, 2785 (1978).A public hearing on the proposed regulations was announced on February24, 1982, 47 FR 8028, and held on April 20, 1982. After consideration ofall comments regarding the proposed regulations, such proposed regulationsare adopted as revised by this Treasury Decision.These regulations are issued under the authority contained in section 7805of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 7805).<ITAG tagnum="84">Tax Reform Act of 1984</ITAG>The final regulations include provisions interpreting the amendments tosection 401(k) enacted by section 527 of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (TRA'84), 98 Stat. 494, 875 (1984). These amendments provide for the treatmentof certain money purchase pension plans in existence on June 27, 1974,as cash or deferred arrangements and change the application of the specialactual deferral percentage (ADP) tests. As amended, section 401(k) requiresan arrangement to satisfy one of the special ADP tests in order to be aqualified arrangement.The amendments also clarify the definition of the actual deferral percentagewith respect to an employee who is eligible to participate in more thanone cash or deferred arrangement sponsored by the same employer. In addition,the amendments require aggregation of certain arrangements for purposesof testing for discrimination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Tax Reform Act of 1986</ITAG>The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA '86), Pub. L. 99-514, 100 Stat. 2085, madenumerous changes that affect cash or deferred arrangements. Some of thesechanges raise no questions of interpretation. These include such changesas allowing rural electric cooperatives to maintain qualified cash or deferredarrangements and a new ADP test. Such provisions have been incorporatedin the final regulations with appropriate effective dates. The final regulationsalso use, where appropriate, terms introduced by TRA '86, such as ``qualifiednonelective contributions'' (QNCs) and ``qualified matching contributions''(QMACs), in lieu of terms used in the proposed regulations. In addition,the final regulations refer to changes made by TRA '86 relating to newdefinitions of compensation and highly compensated employee and to newstandards for testing discrimination in coverage. The substantive aspectsof such changes have been or will be addressed in proposed regulations.Certain changes affecting cash or deferred arrangements that were madeby TRA '86 are not addressed in these regulations. Thus, for example, thecircumstances under which QMACs may be treated as elective contributionsin plan years beginning after December 31, 1986, are not addressed in theseregulations. No inferences as to the interpretation of TRA '86 provisionsnot specifically addressed in these regulations should be drawn from theseregulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments Received and Actions Taken</ITAG>Comments received about the proposed regulations centered on four majorareas: the definition of compensation; the time when contributions mustbe made to be used in the ADP test; the definition of hardship for purposesof making withdrawals; and whether plans may recharacterize certain deferralsof highly compensated employees as employee contributions. The followingdiscussion summarizes the comments received and the provisions adoptedin the final regulations in response to the comments received.<ITAG tagnum="84">Cash or Deferred Arrangements Generally</ITAG>The proposed regulations defined a cash or deferred arrangement to meanany arrangement which is part of a profit-sharing or stock bonus plan underwhich an eligible employee may elect to have the employer contribute anamount to a trust under the plan or to have the amount paid to the employeein cash. The proposed regulations did not discuss the cash or deferredelection. The final regulations expand the definition of cash or deferredarrangement to include any such arrangement that is part of a qualifiedplan (including a plan intended to be a qualified plan), rather than merelya profit-sharing or stock bonus plan, and clarify that a cash or deferredelection exists if an employee may choose between receiving an employercontribution to a qualified plan and receiving cash or another taxablebenefit.The proposed regulations stated that a profit-sharing or stock bonus planthat included a nonqualified cash or deferred arrangement could neverthelessbe a qualified plan under section 401(a). The final regulations adopt thisprovision, but clarify that in determining whether such a plan satisfiesthe requirements of section 401(a)(4), elective contributions under thenonqualified cash or deferred arrangement are to be treated as employercontributions to the extent that such contributions would be treated asemployer contributions if the arrangement were a qualified cash or deferredarrangement. However, for this purpose, the special nondiscrimination testof section 401(k)(3) and Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.401(k)-1(b)(2) may notbe used. This rule applies without regard to the reason the cash or deferredarrangement fails to be a qualified arrangement under section 401(k). Futureguidance will set forth the method for determining whether the amount ofelective contributions under a nonqualified cash or deferred arrangementsatisfies section 401(a)(4).<ITAG tagnum="85">401(k) Exclusive Means to Electively Defer Compensation Under QualifiedPlans</ITAG>Some commentators suggested that section 401(k) is not the exclusive meansfor electively deferring compensation under qualified plans on a pre-taxbasis. Under this theory, an employee (using the rational of Rev. Rul.60-31, 1960-1 CB 174) would be permitted to choose before the end of ataxable year not to received some portion of the compensation he wouldearn and to which he would otherwise be entitled for the next taxable year.This amount then could be contributed by the employee's employer to a qualifiedplan and not be included in the employee's income for the next taxableyear. In addition, the qualified plan would not be required to satisfyany of the special rules applicable to cash or deferred arrangements undersection 401(k).Based on the Revenue Act of 1978 (sections 131-135), the legislative historyof that Act, and subsequent legislation, the final regulations clarifythat section 401(k) is the exclusive method of deferring compensation onan elective, pre-tax basis under a qualified plan. Thus, if the requirementsof section 401(k) are not satisfied, an employee's elective contributionsunder a qualified plan are includible in the employee's gross income forthe taxable year in which the employee would have received the amounts(but for the deferral election). This is the case even though the employeemakes the election before the taxable year in which the amounts are earned.This position is consistent with the Service's position on elective contributionsunder a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, a tax-sheltered annuitycontract, and a flexible benefit plan (including a cafeteria plan). Thus,except as provided under sections 401(k) and 402(a)(8) (with respect tocertain cash or deferred arrangements in qualified plans), section 457(with respect to certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans of stateand local governments and tax-exempt employers), section 132 of the RevenueAct of 1978 (with respect to certain nonqualified deferred compensationplans of taxable employers), section 403(b) (with respect to certain tax-shelteredannuity contracts), and section 125 (with respect to cafeteria plans),compensation that an employee electively defers or converts under a deferredcompensation plan or a flexible benefit plan, respectively, are includiblein the employee's gross income for the taxable year in which such amountswould have been received by the employee (but for the employee's election).The final regulation provides that the exception under sections 402(a)(8)and 401(k) to this general rule of inclusion of electively deferred orconverted compensation applies with respect to compensation that has notyet become currently available. The ``currently available'' concept isnot related to the question of whether amounts are treated as having beenmade available under section 451.<ITAG tagnum="84">Compensation</ITAG>Proposed Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.401(k)-1(b)(8)(vi) defined compensationto mean the amount taken into account under the plan for purposes of determiningthe amount deferred. The proposed regulations also stated that if suchamount has the effect of discriminating against employees who are not highlycompensated, a nondiscriminatory definition shall be determined by theCommissioner. The proposed regulations permitted a plan to calculate plancompensation other than on a plan year basis if it was calculated on areasonable and consistent basis.Many commentators asked that the definition of compensation be clarified.Among the specific issues raised were the permissibility of annualizingcompensation and whether compensation could include amounts deferred.These concerns have been addressed in andSection; 1.401(k)-1(g)(9) of thefinal regulations. The definition of compensation is intended to give plansflexibility in design while avoiding discrimination. In general, compensationis still defined to mean the amount taken into account under the plan (orplans) in calculating the elective contribution that may be made on behalfof an employee under the deferral election. The regulations specificallyprovide that plans may define compensation to include or exclude electivecontributions. However, actual compensation for a portion of a year maynot be annualized for purposes of testing whether a plan meets the discriminationtests of section 401(k)(3).The final regulations adopt the position in the proposed regulations thatif a plan's definition of compensation has the effect of discriminatingin favor of employees who are highly compensated, a nondiscriminatory definitionshall be determined by the Commissioner. A plan's definition of compensationwill be treated as nondiscriminatory if, for purposes of determining theamount that may be contributed under the plan, the plan defines compensationas either total nondeferred compensation or total nondeferred compensationplus elective contributions under the plan.For plan years which begin after December 31, 1986, plans must use thedefinition of compensation contained in section 414(s) and the regulationsthereunder.<ITAG tagnum="84">Time When Contributions Must Be Made</ITAG>Prop. Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.401(k)-1(b)(7)(iii) required that electivecontributions be paid into the trust within 30 days after the end of theplan year in order to be counted in determining the actual deferral percentagefor such year. Many commentators pointed out that employers may not knowthe amount of their profits by this time and will therefore be unable tocommunicate with their employees regarding the total contribution availableto each and the amount of the total contribution that is to be deferred.Other commentators asserted that the difference between this requirementand the time-of-filing deduction rule (section 404(a)(6)) applicable toall other employer contributions would be administratively complex andthat all contributions should be required to be made by the section 404(a)(6)date. Finally, other commentators argued that elective contributions undera qualified cash or deferred arrangement should not be subject to contributiondue date rules that are more restrictive than the rules that apply to otheremployer contributions.In response to comments, the final regulations (andSection; 1.401(k)-1(b)(6))extend the time period for making elective contributions that may be usedin the ADP test for a plan year to the last day of the twelve-month periodimmediately following the plan year to which the contributions relate.The contributions must be allocated to participants' accounts for the planyear with respect to which the APD test is performed. In addition, thefinal regulations clarify that the elective contributions taken into accountfor a plan year must relate either to compensation that would have beenreceived in the plan year (but for the deferral election) or to compensationattributable to services performed in the plan year that would have beenreceived by the employee (but for the deferral election) within 2\1/2\months after the close of the plan year.No inference should be drawn from these regulations as to when electivecontributions must be contributed to a trust to satisfy Title I of theEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The Departmentof Labor has informed the Treasury Department that elective contributionsto an employee benefit plan, whether made pursuant to a salary reductionagreement or otherwise, would be considered amounts paid to or withheldby an employer (i.e., participant contributions) within the scope of andSection;2510.3-102 (53 FR 17628) and therefore would, in accordance with that regulation,constitute plan assets for purposes of Subtitle A and Parts 1 and 4 ofSubtitle B of Title I of ERISA and for purposes of the prohibited transactionprovisions of section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code.<ITAG tagnum="84">Hardship Withdrawals</ITAG>Prop. Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.401(k)-1(d)(2) permitted hardship distributionsto be made only if two tests were met:(1) The participant had an immediate and heavy financial need; and(2) Other resources were not reasonably available to meet the need.Many commentators interpreted the hardship rules as being stricter thanthose in effect through 1981 under Rev. Rul. 71-224, 1971-1, CB 124, andargued that Congress intended that those same rules should apply to section401(k) plans. The standard contained in Rev. Rul. 71-224 is not adoptedin the final regulations because Rev. Rul. 71-224 merely required thata plan operate in accordance with its definition of hardship.Commentators also requested clarification of terms such as ``immediateand heavy financial needs,'' ``not reasonably available,'' and ``otherresources of the employee.'' Major concerns centered around whether employeeswould be required to sell non-liquid assets or borrow from other sourcesbefore being eligible for a hardship distribution. Several commentatorsproposed that needs for college tuition, a down payment on a principalresidence, or uninsured medical expenses be treated as <T3>per se</T3> hardships, permitting funds to be distributed without regardto the applicant's other financial resources.The final regulations (andSection; 1.401(k)-1(d)(2)) retain the two-partdefinition of hardship in the proposed regulations with additional clarification.However, certain expenses are deemed to constitute immediate and heavyfinancial needs. These include medical expenses, purchase (excluding mortgagepayments) of a principal residence for the employee, payment of tuitionfor post-secondary education for the employee, his spouse or children,and payment of amounts necessary to prevent the eviction of the employeefrom his principal residence or foreclosure on the mortgage of the employee'sprincipal residence. The Commissioner may expand the list of expenses thatwill be deemed to be made on account of an immediate and heavy financialneed of the employee. The Commissioner may exercise this authority onlythrough the publication of revenue rulings, notices, and other documentsof general applicability, rather than on an individual basis.As under the proposed regulations, a hardship distribution cannot be madeif the employee has other resources available to meet the financial need(even if the need is deemed to be an immediate and heavy financial need).The final regulations clarify that an employee thus may have to securethe needed funds elsewhere through liquidation of other assets, reimbursement,or borrowing of funds from commercial sources. A plan may provide, however,than an employee will be deemed to lack other resources reasonably availableto meet a financial need, including a deemed financial need, if (1) theemployee has obtained all distributions, other than hardship distributions,and all nontaxable loans available under all plans maintained by the employer;(2) the plan, and all other plans maintained by the employer, provide thatthe employee's elective contributions (and employee contributions) willbe suspended for at least twelve months after receipt of the hardship distribution;and (3) the plan, and all other plans maintained by the employer, providethat the maximum amount of elective contributions for the employee forthe taxable year of the employee following the taxable year in which theemployee received the hardship distribution is the excess of the applicablelimit under section 402(g) for such next taxable year over such employee'selective contributions for the taxable year in which the employee receivedthe hardship distribution. Of course, the distribution may not exceed theamount of the employee's immediate and heavy financial need. The finalregulations also include a limited exception to section 411(d)(6) permittingan employer to adopt the deemed no other resources provision.Many commentators proposed that the plan administrator have the right torely upon the applicant's representations regarding his need for, and proposeduse of, his benefits. These commentators argued that requiring financialstatements from employees would invade the applicant's privacy and detertruly needy employees from applying for hardship distributions. The finalregulations permit the employer to reasonably rely upon the representationsof the employee regarding the employee's financial affairs and thus donot require the employer or plan administrator to make an independent investigationof an employee's financial affairs. In addition, the special rule underwhich employees may be deemed to lack other resources is available to minimizea plan administrator's intrusion into the employee's financial affairs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Recharacterization</ITAG>The proposed regulations permitted a plan to preclude elections or contributionsthat would cause a plan that contained a cash or deferred arrangement tofail the ADP test and to correct discrimination through additional nonelectiveemployer contributions that met the nonforfeitability and distributionrequirements applicable to elective contributions. In the preamble to theproposed regulations, the Service requested comments on additional methodsthat plans could utilize to satisfy the nondiscrimination test.Numerous commentators urged the Service to permit employers to recharacterizeamounts contributed at the employee's election if, at the end of the planyear, the actual deferral percentage for the higher-paid group exceededthe limits of section 401(k)(3)(A). The effect of recharacterization wouldbe to treat recharacterized amounts as employee contributions and, thus,these amounts would not be subject to the anti-discrimination rules ofsection 401(a)(4) and 401(k) that apply to employer contributions. If permittedto use this approach after the end of a plan year, plan sponsors couldavoid disqualification of their cash or deferred arrangements (and plansincluding such arrangements) while ensuring that higher-paid employeesdid not receive elective contributions in excess of the amounts permittedunder the ADP tests of section 401(k)(3)(A). The Service announced on January8, 1982, 47 FR 998, that such recharacterization was not permitted by theproposed regulations.Several commentators pointed out that the Service itself had establishedthe precedent for recharacterization in the proposed regulations governingTRASOP's, Prop. Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.46-9(f)(3)(iv), 44 FR 48269, 48273(1979); later adopted in T.D. 7856, 47 FR 54803, 54807 (1982). These regulationspermit the return of employer contributions ``to the extent that plan operationwould otherwise result in prohibited discrimination.''In response to these comments, the final regulations, under the authorityof section 7805(b), permit recharacterization; such recharacterizationwill be permitted for plan years which begin before January 1, 1987. Plansmay be amended to permit recharacterization for such plan years. Excesselective contributions recharacterized as employee contributions are tobe taxed (income, FICA, SECA, and FUTA) to the employee in the year towhich the contributions relate, rather than the year in which the recharacterizationtakes place. However, for purposes of other Code provisions, includingsections 401(k)(2), 404, 409, 411, 412, 415, 416, and 417, recharacterizedcontributions continue to be treated as employer contributions. In addition,these amounts cannot be distributed except as provided in andSection; 1.401(k)-1(d)of the final regulations.If amounts recharacterized for any plan year were not previously includedin income, they are to be treated as received by employees for income taxpurposes on the first day of the first plan year ending in 1988. If noticeof recharacterization is provided to the affected highly compensated employeeswithin 75 days after the date of publication of this Treasury Decisionin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, recharacterization is deemed to have occurred75 days after the close of the plan year and the penalty tax of section4979 will not be imposed.For plan years which begin after December 31, 1986, the treatment of excesscontributions will be addressed in regulations under 401(k)(8) of the InternalRevenue Code of 1986.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Actions Taken</ITAG>Other changes in style and organization have been made in order to improve,clarify and resolve areas that commentators noted as being ambiguous.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Dates </ITAG>These regulations are generally effective for plan years which begin afterDecember 31, 1979. Those provisions of the regulations relating to changesmade by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 are generally effective for plan yearswhich begin after December 31, 1986. There is a special effective daterule for the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that affect plansmaintained pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. For plan yearsbeginning after December 31, 1979 (or, in the case of a pre-ERISA moneypurchase plan, plan years beginning after July 18, 1984) and before January1, 1988, a reasonable interpretation of the rules set forth in section401(k) of the Code (as in effect during those years) may be relied uponto determine whether a cash or deferred arrangement was qualified duringthose years. For years beginning before January 1, 1987, operation in accordancewith the regulations proposed on November 10, 1981, is a reasonable interpretationof section 401(k).<ITAG tagnum="84">Plan Amendments </ITAG>Plan sponsors may defer amendments required by these regulations untilthe earlier of plan termination or the last date for making amendmentsprovided by section 1140 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, as extended inthe regulations under section 401(b). In general, the last day on whicha determination letter on plan amendments may be requested under section401(b) is the last date prescribed by law, including extensions, for filingthe income tax return of the employer for the employer's taxable year inwhich the date of the remedial amendment period begins. If a determinationletter is requested during this period, the required plan amendments mustbe adopted no later than ninety days after receipt of a favorable determinationletter.<ITAG tagnum="84">401(b) Amendment Period </ITAG>Section 1140 of TRA '86 provides, in general, that if the statutory provisionsof TRA '86 effective before 1989 require amendment of plan provisions,plan amendments need not be made until the last day of the first plan yearbeginning after December 31, 1988, provided the amendment is effectiveretroactively to the statutory effective date and the plan is operatedin accordance with the requirements of the provision as of its effectivedate with respect to the plan. Section 401(b) and the regulations thereunderpermit retroactive amendments of ``disqualifying provisions.'' Pursuant to the authority of section 7805(b), the regulations under section401(b) of the Code are amended to provide that, under certain circumstances,a plan provision (or the absence of a required plan provision) that resultsin the failure of a plan to satisfy the qualification requirements of theCode by reason of any change in such requirements effected by the Tax ReformAct of 1986 (TRA '86), Pub. L. 99-514, the Omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1986 (OBRA '86), Pub. L. 99-509, or the Omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1987 (OBRA '87), Pub. L. 100-203, that is effective before the firstday of the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1989, will be a``disqualifying provision'' within the meaning of Treas. Reg. andSection;1.401(b)-1(b). Included in the definition of disqualifying provisions withrespect to TRA '86, OBRA '86 and OBRA '87 are provisions that are integralto a qualification requirement changed by TRA '86, OBRA '86, or OBRA '87or otherwise treated, directly or indirectly, as subject to the conditionsof section 1140 of TRA '86. Examples of provisions to which the precedingsentence might apply are: (1) a plan provision permitting contributionsto a profit-sharing plan without regard to current or accumulated profitsand (2) plan amendments required under Rev. Rul. 86-74, 1986-1 C.B. 205,that may be deferred until the date the plan must be amended to complywith TRA '86 as determined under section 1140 thereof as provided in Notice88-9, 1988-4 I.R.B. 21. Plan provisions will not be considered disqualifying provisions to whichthe amended section 401(b) retroactive amendment period applies unlesstwo conditions are met. First, with respect to requirements effective before1989, the plan must have been operated in accordance with the requirementas of the applicable effective date. Second, the applicable qualificationrequirement must be effective before the first day of the first plan yearbeginning after December 31, 1989. Thus, for example, if a collectivelybargained plan need not comply with TRA '86 provisions until 1990, suchplan does not have the section 401(b) amendment period based on the 1990plan year, since it already has a period longer than that which would applyto the plan under a section 401(b) period based on a 1989 effective date.In applying Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.401(b)-1(c)(1), as it applies to anydisqualifying provision described above resulting from TRA '86, OBRA '86,and OBRA '87, the remedial amendment period begins on the day the applicabledisqualifying provision becomes effective with respect to the plan. Inapplying Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.401(b)-1(c)(2) to determine the end ofsuch remedial amendment period, such remedial amendment period is deemedto have begun on the first day of the first plan year which begins afterDecember 31, 1988. The regulations under section 401(b) are also being amended to give theCommissioner the authority in the future to treat changes to the qualificationrequirements made by an amendment to the Code as disqualifying provisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Non-Applicability of Executive Order </ITAG>The Treasury Department has determined that this regulation is not subjectto review under Executive Order 12291 or the Treasury and OMB implementationof the Order dated April 29, 1983.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>No general notice of proposed rule making is required by 5 U.S.C. 553(b)for interpretative regulations.

4. A new andSection; 1.401(k)-1 is added immediately after andSection;1.401(k)-0 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.401(k)-1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Certain cash or deferred arrangements.</ITAG>(a) <T3>In general</T3>_(1) <T3>General rule. </T3>A plan, other than a profit-sharing, stock bonus,pre-ERISA money purchase pension, or rural electric cooperative plan, willfail to satisfy the requirements of section 401(a) if the plan includesa cash or deferred arrangement. A profit-sharing, stock bonus, pre-ERISAmoney purchase pension, or rural electric cooperative plan will not failto satisfy the requirements of section 401(a) merely because the plan includesa cash or deferred arrangement.(2) <T3>Cash or deferred arrangement</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii), a cashor deferred arrangement is an arrangement under which an eligible employeemay make a cash or deferred election to have the employer either contributean amount to a trust under a plan that meets (or is intended to meet) therequirements of section 401(a) or provide an amount to the employee incash or in the form of some other taxable benefit. An arrangement underwhich the employee may make a cash or deferred election to have the employercontribute an amount to a trust under a plan that meets (or is intendedto meet) the requirements of section 401(a) includes an arrangement underwhich the employee may elect either to receive cash or a taxable amountor to accrue a benefit under a defined benefit plan that is intended tomeet the requirements of section 401(a), and an arrangement under whichthe employee may elect either to receive cash or a taxable amount or tohave the employer contribute an amount to a contract that meets the requirementsor section 401(a) of 403(a).(ii) <T3>After-tax employee contributions. </T3>A cash or deferred arrangementdoes not include an arrangement pursuant to which amounts contributed undera plan at an employee's election are designated or treated at the timeof deferral or contribution as after-tax employee contributions (e.g.,by reporting the contributions as taxable income subject to applicablewithholding requirements). See also section 414(h)(1). This is the caseeven if the employee's election to make after-tax employee contributionsis made before the amounts subject to the election are currently availableto the employee.(3) <T3>Cash or deferred election</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule. </T3>A cash or deferred election is an election (or modificationof an earlier election) that is made at any time permitted by the planwith respect to cash or other taxable amounts that are not currently availableto the electing employee as of the date of the election and are not designatedor treated as after-tax employee contributions at the time of deferralor contribution. A cash or deferred election includes a salary reductionagreement between an eligible employee and the employer under which a contributionis made under the plan only if the employee elects to reduce his cash compensationor to forgo an increase in his cash compensation.(ii) <T3>Amounts currently available. </T3>Cash or another taxable amount iscurrently available to the employee if it has been paid to the employeeor if the employee is able currently to receive the cash or other taxableamount at his discretion. An amount is not currently available to an employeeif there is a significant limitation or restriction on the employee's rightto receive the amount currently. Similarly, an amount is not currentlyavailable as of a date if the employee may under no circumstances receivethe amount before a particular time in the future.(iii) <T3>Certain one-time elections. </T3>A cash or deferred election does notinclude a one-time irrevocable election, upon an employee's commencementof employment or upon an employee's first becoming eligible under any planof the employer, to have a specified amount or percentage of compensation(including no amount of compensation) contributed by the employer, on behalfof the employee to the plan and any other plan of the employer (includingplans not yet established) for the duration of the employee's employmentwith the employer. Thus, employer contributions pursuant to such a one-timeelection are not treated as having been made pursuant to a cash or deferredarrangement.(iv) <T3>Tax treatment. </T3>An amount generally is includible in an employee'sgross income for the taxable year in which the employee actually receives,or is treated as having received, such amount. But for section 402(a)(8)and section 401(k), an employee is treated as having received an amountthat is contributed under a plan pursuant to the employee's cash or deferredelection. This is the case even if the election to defer is made beforethe year in which such amount has been earned or becomes currently available.See andSection; 1.402(a)-1(d).(v) <T3>Examples. </T3>The provisions of this subparagraph (a)(3) are illustratedby the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>An employer maintains a profit-sharing plan underwhich each eligible employee has an election with respect to an annualbonus of ten percent of his compensation payable on January 30 each yearwith respect to the prior calendar year's profits. Deferred amounts arenot treated as after-tax employee contributions. An election made priorto January 30 to defer all or part of the bonus is a cash or deferred electionand the bonus deferral arrangement is a cash or deferred arrangement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>An employer maintains a profit-sharing plan underwhich each eligible employee may elect to defer up to 10 percent of compensationfor each payroll period during the plan year. An election to defer compensationfor a payroll period is a cash or deferred election if such election ismade prior to the date on which such compensation is to be paid to theemployee and if such deferred amount is not treated as an after-tax employeecontribution at the time of deferral.</ITAG>(4) <T3>Qualified cash or deferred arrangement</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>A qualified cash or deferred arrangement is a cashor deferred arrangement that satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b),(c), (d), and (e) of this section and that is part of a plan that otherwisemeets the requirements of section 401(a).(ii) <T3>Treatment of elective contributions as employer contributions. </T3>Exceptas provided in paragraph (f) of this section, elective contributions undera qualified cash or deferred arrangement are treated as employer contributionsunder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Thus, for example, such electivecontributions are treated as employer contributions for purposes of sections401(a), 401(k), 404, 409, 411, 412, 415, 416, and 417.(iii) <T3>Tax treatment of employees. </T3>Except as provided in section 402(g)and paragraph (f) of this section, elective contributions under a qualifiedcash or deferred arrangement are not includible in an employee's grossincome at the time such contributions would have been received in cash(but for the cash or deferred election) or at the time contributed underthe plan. See andSection; 1.402(a)-1(d).(iv) <T3>Nondiscrimination requirement. </T3>The amount of elective contributionsunder a qualified cash or deferred arrangement must satisfy section 401(a)(4).For plan years beginning after December 31, 1984, the amount of electivecontributions will satisfy section 401(a)(4) only if such elective contributionssatisfy the special nondiscrimination test in paragraph (b)(2) of thissection.(v) <T3>Plan assets. </T3>The extent to which elective contributions undera cash or deferred arrangement constitute plan assets for purposes of theprohibited transaction provisions of section 4975 of the Internal RevenueCode and Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974shall be determined in accordance with regulations and rulings issued bythe Department of Labor.(5) <T3>Nonqualified cash or deferred arrangement</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>A nonqualified cash or deferred arrangement is a cashor deferred arrangement that is not a qualified cash or deferred arrangement.Thus, if a cash or deferred arrangement fails to satisfy one or more ofthe requirements in paragraph (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this section, sucharrangement is a nonqualified cash or deferred arrangement.(ii) <T3>Treatment of elective contributions as employer contributions. </T3>Exceptas specifically provided otherwise, elective contributions under a nonqualifiedcash or deferred arrangement are treated as employer contributions underthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Thus, for example, such elective contributionsare treated as employer contributions for purposes of sections 401(a) (includingsection 401(a)(4)), 401(k), 404, 409, 411, 412, 415, 416, and 417.(iii) <T3>Tax treatment of employees. </T3>Elective contributions under a nonqualifiedcash or deferred arrangement are includible in an employee's gross incomeat the time such contributions would have been received (but for the cashor deferred election). See andSection; 1.402(a)-1(d).(iv) <T3>Qualification of plan that includes a nonqualified cash or deferredarrangement. </T3>A profit-sharing, stock bonus, pre-ERISA money purchasepension, or rural electric cooperative plan will not fail to satisfy section401(a) merely because such plan includes a nonqualified cash or deferredarrangement. In determining whether such a plan satisfies the requirementsof section 401(a)(4), elective contributions under the nonqualified cashor deferred arrangement are to be treated as employer contributions tothe extent that such contributions would be treated as employer contributionsif the arrangement were a qualified cash or deferred arrangement, but thespecial nondiscrimination test of paragraph (b)(2) may not be used.(b) <T3>Coverage and discrimination requirements_</T3>(1) <T3>Coverage. </T3>(i) For plan years which begin before January 1, 1989,or such later date provided under paragraph (h) of this section, a cashor deferred arrangement satisfies this paragraph (b) for a plan year onlyif the eligible employees under the arrangement satisfy the 70 percenttest of section 410(b)(1)(A) or the nondiscriminatory classification testof section 410(b)(1)(H). For purposes of this subdivision, all eligibleemployees under the arrangement are treated as benefiting under the arrangement.For purposes of this subdivision, section 410(b) means section 410(b) priorto its amendment by section 1112 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA '86).(ii) For plan years which begin after December 31, 1988, or on or afterthe later date provided under paragraph (h) of this section, a cash ordeferred arrangement satisfies this paragraph (b) for a plan year onlyif the eligible employees under the arrangement satisfy either the percentagetest of section 410(b)(1)(A), the ratio test of section 410(b)(1)(B), orthe reasonable classification test of section 410(b)(2)(A)(i) (and, insuch case, the average benefit percentage test of section 410(b)(2)(A)(ii)is satisfied). For purposes of applying section 410(b), all eligible employeesunder the arrangement are treated as benefiting under the arrangement.(iii) A plan described in section 410(c)(1) will be treated as satisfyingthe requirements of section 410 if such plan meets the requirements ofsection 401(a)(3) as in effect on September 1, 1974.(2) <T3>Nondiscriminatory elective contributions. </T3>A cash or deferred arrangementsatisfies this paragraph (b) for a plan year only if_(i) The elective contributions under the arrangement, or(ii) The elective contributions, in combination with qualified nonelectivecontributions and qualified matching contributions that are treated aselective contributions under the arrangement,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">satisfy the actual deferral percentage test in paragraph (b)(4) ofthis section. If a cash or deferred arrangement satisfies this paragraph(b)(2), such arrangement will be treated as satisfying section 401(a)(4)with respect to the amount of elective contributions. See paragraph (e)(1)of this section with respect to the application of section 401(a)(4) toother benefits, rights and features under a cash or deferred arrangement.Employee contributions may not be treated as elective contributions undera cash or deferred arrangement for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2).(3) <T3>Qualified nonelective contributions and qualified matching contributionsthat may be treated as elective contributions. </T3>Except as specificallyprovided otherwise, for purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section,all or part of the qualified nonelective contributions and qualified matchingcontributions made with respect to those employees who are eligible employeesunder the cash or deferred arrangement being tested may be treated as electivecontributions provided that each of the following (to the extent applicable)is satisfied:(i) The nonelective contributions, including those qualified nonelectivecontributions treated as elective contributions for purposes of the actualdeferral percentage test, satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(4).(ii) The nonelective contributions, excluding those qualified nonelectivecontributions treated as elective contributions for purposes of the actualdeferral percentage test, satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(4).(iii) The matching contributions, including those qualified matching contributionstreated as elective contributions for purposes of the actual deferral percentagetest, satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(4).(iv) The matching contributions, excluding those qualified matching contributionstreated as elective contributions for purposes of the actual deferral percentagetest, satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(4).(v) Except as provided in subdivisions (i) and (iii) of this paragraph(b)(3), the qualified nonelective contributions for purposes of the actualdeferral percentage test are not taken into account in determining whetherany other contributions or benefits satisfy section 401(a)(4).(vi) The qualified nonelective contributions and qualified matching contributionssatisfy paragraph (b)(6)(i) for the plan year as if such contributionswere elective contributions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Qualified matching contributions taken into account for plan yearswhich begin after December 31, 1986, or on or after the later date providedunder paragraph (h) of this section, are also to be treated in accordancewith the requirements of section 401(m) and the regulations thereunder.(4) <T3>Actual deferral percentage tests. </T3>(i) For plan years which beginafter December 31, 1979, and before January 1, 1987, or such later dateprovided under paragraph (h) of this section, the actual deferral percentagetest is satisfied if either of the following test is met:(A) The actual deferral percentage for the group of eligible highly compensatedemployees (top one-third) is not more than the actual deferral percentagefor the group of all other eligible employees (lower two-thirds) multipliedby 1.5, or (B) The excess of the actual deferral percentage for the top one-thirdover the actual deferral percentage for the lower two-thirds is not mroethan three percentage points, and the actual deferral percentage for thetop one-third is not more than the actual deferral percentage for the lowertwo-thirds multiplied by 2.5.(ii) For plan years which begin after December 31, 1986, or such laterdate provided under paragraph (h) of this section, the actual deferralpercentage test is satisfied if either of the following test is met:(A) The actual deferral percentage for the group of eligible highly compensatedemployees is not more than the actual deferral percentage for the groupof all other eligible employees multiplied by 1.25, or(B) The excess of the actual deferral percentage for the group of eligiblehighly compensated employees over the actual deferral percentage for thegroup of all other eligible employees is not more than two percentage points,and the actual deferral percentage for the group of eligible highly compensatedemployees is not more than the actual deferral percentage for the groupof all other eligible employees multiplied by two.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For plan years which begin after December 31, 1986, or such laterdate provided in paragraph (h) of this section, the plan must provide thatthe actual deferral percentage test will be met.

In such a case, the case or deferred arrangementsincluded in such plans and the plans including such arrangements shallbe treated as one arrangement and as one plan for purposes of this paragraph(b) and sections 401(a)(4), 401(k) and 410(b). If an employer maintainstwo or more plans that are treated as a single plan for purposes of section401(a)(4) or 410(b) (other than section 410(b)(2)(A)(ii) as in effect forplan years which begin after December 31, 1988), all cash or deferred arrangementsthat are included in such plans are treated as a single arrangement forpurposes of this paragraph (b) and sections 401(a)(4), 401(k), and 410(b).(ii) <T3>Impermissible aggregation of arrangements and plans. </T3>For planyears which begin after December 31, 1988, notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(2),(b)(3) and (b)(5)(i) of this section, contributions and allocations undera plan described in section 4975(e)(7) (an ESOP) may not be combined withcontributions or allocations under any plan not described in section 4975(e)(7)(a non-ESOP) for purposes of determining whether either the ESOP or thenon-ESOP satisfies this paragraph (b) and sections 401(a)(4), 401(k), and410(b).

See also andSection;54.4974-11(a)(5), which provides that an ESOP may form a portion of a planthe balance of which includes a qualified pension, profit-sharing, or stockbonus plan which is not an ESOP. For example, in determining whether electivecontributions under a cash or deferred arrangement that is included inthe portion of a plan that is not an ESOP satisfy paragraph (b) and section401(a)(4) and whether nonelective contributions under the portion of theplan that is an ESOP satisfy section 401(a)(4), such elective contributionsand nonelective contributions may not be considered together. Thus, withrespect to such elective contributions, the nonelective contributions maynot be treated as qualified nonelective contributions. Similarly, for planyears which begin after December 31, 1988, contributions for which a taxcredit is provided may not be treated as elective contributions under paragraphs(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.(6) <T3>Elective contributions taken into account for a plan year. </T3>Anelective contribution may be taken into account under paragraph (b)(2)of this section for a plan year only if it satisfies paragraphs (b)(6)(i)and (b)(6)(ii) of this section.(i) The elective contribution is allocated to the employee under the planas of a date within that plan year.

The actual deferral percentagefor the lower two-thirds, consisting of employees 4 through 9, is threepercent.

Nevertheless,the two percent nonelective contribution may also be taken into accountin applying the special rules because those contributions are qualifiednonelective contributions that satisfy paragraph (b)(3) of this section.The six percent nonelective contribution may not be taken into accountbecause it is not a qualified nonelective contribution.(v) If the two percent qualified nonelective contributions are taken intoaccount, the actual deferral percentage for the top one-third is five percent,and the actual deferral percentage for the lower two-thirds is two percent.Because five percent is not more than three percentage points greater thantwo percent, and not more than two percent multiplied by 2.5, the actualdeferral percentage test in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section is satisfied.Thus, the plan satisfies this paragraph (b).(c) <T3>Nonforfeitability</T3>_(1) <T3>General rule. </T3>A cash or deferred arrangment satisfies this paragraph(c) only if each employee's right to the amount attributable to electivecontributions_(i) Is immediately nonforfeitable within the meaning of section 411, withoutregard to section 411(a)(3), and would be nonforfeitable under the planregardless of the age and service of the employee or whether the employeeis employed on a specific date;(ii) Is disregarded for purposes of applying section 411(a) to other contributionsor benefits; and(iii) Remains nonforfeitable even if the employee makes no additional electivecontributions under a cash or deferred arrangement.(2) <T3>Example. </T3>This paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example. </T3>Employees B and C are covered by Employer Y's stock bonusplan, which includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement. Under theplan, Employer Y makes a nonelective contribution on behalf of each employeeequal to four percent of their compensation.

EmployerY also permits employees to elect to defer up to six percent of their compensationthrough salary reduction agreements. Amounts deferred under these agreementsare nonforfeitable at all times. In accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i),the nonforfeitable percentage of Employer Y's nonelective contributionon behalf of B and C may not be treated as a qualified nonelective contributionunder paragraph (b)(3) of this section, because these amounts are nonforfeitableby reason of the completion by B and C of a stated number of years of service,and not regardless of the age and service of B and C.</ITAG>(d) <T3>Distribution limitation</T3>_(1) <T3>General rule. </T3>For plan years which begin before January 1, 1985,a cash or deferred arrangement satisfies this paragraph (d) only if amountsattributable to elective contributions are not distributable earlier thanupon one of the following events:(i) The employee's retirement, death, disability, or separation from service;or(ii) In the case of a profit-sharing or stock bonus plan, the employee'shardship or attainment of age 59\1/2\.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">A plan will not fail to satisfy this paragraph by reason of a dividenddistribution described in section 404(k)(2).(2) <T3>Hardship</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule. </T3>For purposes of this section, a distribution ison account of hardship only if the distribution both is made on accountof an immediate and heavy financial need of the employee and is necessaryto satisfy such financial need.

Employer C maintains a profit-sharing plan that includesa cash or deferred arrangement. Elective contributions under the arrangementmay be withdrawn for any reason after two years following the end of theplan year in which the contributions were made. Because the plan permitsdistributions of elective contributions before the occurrence of one ofthe events specified in section 401(k)(2)(B) and this paragraph (d), theplan includes a nonqualified cash or deferred arrangement and the electivecontributions are currently includible in income.</ITAG>(e) <T3>Additional requirements</T3>_(1)<T3> Qualified profit-sharing, stock bonus, pre-ERISA money purchase, andrural electric cooperative plan requirement</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule. </T3>A cash or deferred arrangement satisfies this paragraph(e) only if the elective contributions under such arrangement are treatedas contributions under a profit-sharing, stock bonus, pre-ERISA money purchasepension or rural electric cooperative plan that satisfies the requirementsof section 401(a). The plan of which a cash or deferred arrangement isa part may provide for other contributions, including employer contributions(other than elective contributions), employee contributions, or both. Theplan will be treated as satisfying the requirements of section 401(a) onlyif such plan, taking into account any cash or deferred arrangement thatis part of such plan and any elective contributions under such arrangement,satisfies the requirements of section 401(a). See paragraph (b) of thissection for certain limitations on the extent to which elective contributionsunder a cash or deferred arrangement may be taken into account in determiningthe extent to which other contributions satisfy the requirements of section401(a).(ii) <T3>Nondiscrimination requirements</T3>. A cash or deferred arrangementsatisfies this paragraph (e)(1) only if, in addition to satisfying paragraph(b)(2) of this section with respect to the amount of elective contributions,the plan of which the arrangement is a part satisfies section 401(a)(4)with respect to other benefits, rights, and features under the plan, including,for example, the availability of elective contributions to eligible employees.Thus, for example, the percentage of compensation available under a cashor deferred arrangement for deferral as elective contributions by eligibleemployees may not discriminate in favor of the group of employees describedin section 401(a)(4). Furthermore, for example, if all employees are eligibleto make elective contributions under an arrangement, but such contributionsmay be made only from compensation in excess of a stated amount, such asthe Social Security taxable wage base, such arrangement would favor highlycompensated employees with respect to the availability of elective contributionsand thus would not satisfy section 401(a)(4). In such a case, the planof which the arrangement is a part fails to satisfy section 401(a). Seealso andSection;1.40(a)-4 with respect to optional forms of benefit.(2) <T3>Cash availability</T3>. A cash or deferred arrangement satisfies thisparagraph (e) only if such arrangement provides that the amount that eacheligible employee may defer as an elective contribution is available tothe employee in cash. Thus, for example, if an eligible employee is providedthe option to receive a taxable benefit (other than cash) or to have theemployer contribute on the employee's behalf to a profit-sharing plan anamount equal to the value of the taxable benefit, such arrangement is nota qualified cash or deferred arrangement. Similarly, if an employee hasthe option to receive a specified amount in cash or to have the employercontribute on his behalf to a profit-sharing plan an amount in excess ofthe specified cash amount, any contribution made by the employer on theemployee's behalf in excess of the specified cash amount is not treatedas made pursuant to a qualified cash or deferred arrangement. This cashavailability requirement applies even if the cash or deferred arrangementis part of a cafeteria plan within the meaning of section 125.(3) <T3>Separate accounting</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule</T3>. A cash or deferred arrangement satisfies this paragraph(e) only if all amounts held under a plan that includes a cash or deferredarrangement or under another plan whose contributions are taken into accountunder the arrangement for purposes of paragraph (b) (including amountscontributed for plan years which begin prior to January 1, 1980, contributionsmade other than on account of a cash or deferred election, and contributionsmade for years when the cash or deferred arrangement is not qualified)are treated as attributable to elective contributions subject to the requirementsof paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.(ii) <T3>Exception.</T3> The requirements of subdivision (i) of this paragraph(e)(3) will be treated as satisfied if the portion of an employee's benefitthat is actually attributable to elective contributions subject to therequirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, and to qualifiednonelective contributions and qualified matching contributions treatedas elective contributions, is determined by an acceptable separate accountingbetween such portion and any other benefits. Separate accounting is notacceptable unless gains, losses, withdrawals, and other credits or chargesare separately allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to the accountsin which accrued benefits are subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of thissection and to the accounts for other benefits. Subject to section 401(a)(4),forfeitures are not required to be allocated to the accounts in which benefitsare subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.(f) <T3>Correction of excess contributions</T3>_(1) <T3>General rule</T3>. A cash or deferred arrangement will not be treatedas failing to satisfy section 401(k)(3) or paragraph (b)(2) of this sectionwith respect to the amount of elective contributions under the arrangementif the employer, in accordance with the terms of the plan and paragraph(b)(3) of this section, makes qualified nonelective contributions or qualifiedmatching contributions that are treated as elective contributions underthe arrangement and that, in combination with the elective contributions,satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. In addition,a cash or deferred arrangement will not be treated as failing to satisfysection 401(k)(3) or paragraph (b)(2) of this section with respect to theamount of the elective contributions if, in accordance with the terms ofthe plan that includes the arrangement, excess contributions on behalfof highly compensated employees are recharacterized in accordance withparagraph (f)(3) of this section. Excess contributions for a plan yearmay not remain unallocated or be allocated to a suspense account for allocationto one or more employees in any future year.(2) <T3>Amount of excess contributions. </T3>The amount of excess contributionsfor a highly compensated employee for a plan year is to be determined bythe following leveling method, under which the actual deferral ratio ofthe highly compensated employee with the highest actual deferral ratiois reduced to the extent required to_(i) Enable the arrangement to satisfy the actual deferral percentage test,or(ii) Cause such highly compensated employee's actual deferral ratio toequal the ratio of the highly compensated employee with the next highestactual deferral ratio.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This process must be repeated until the cash or deferred arrangementsatisfies the actual deferral percentage test. For each highly compensatedemployee, the amount of excess contributions is equal to the total electivecontributions, plus qualified nonelective contributions and qualified matchingcontributions treated as elective contributions, on behalf of the employee(determined prior to the application of this paragraph (f)(2)) minus theamount determined by multiplying the employee's actual deferral ratio (determinedafter application of this subparagraph) by his compensation used in determiningsuch ratio. In no case shall the amount of excess contributions to be recharacterizedfor a plan year with respect to any highly compensated employee exceedthe amount of elective contributions made on behalf of such highly compensatedemployee for such plan year.(3) <T3>Recharacterization of excess contributions</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule</T3>. Excess contributions are recharacterized in accordancewith this paragraph (f)(3) only if the excess contributions are treatedas described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section and all of the conditionsset forth in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section are satisfied.(ii) <T3>Treatment of recharacterized excess contributions</T3>. Excess contributionsrecharacterized under this paragraph (f)(3) are includible in the employee'sgross income on the earliest dates any elective contribution made on behalfof the employee during the plan year would have been received by the employeehad he originally elected to receive the amounts in cash or on such laterdate permitted in paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section. Such recharacterizedexcess contributions must be treated as employee contributions for thefollowing purposes:(A) The payor or plan administrator must report such recharacterized excesscontributions as employee contributions to the Internal Revenue Serviceand the employee by_(<T3>1</T3>) Timely providing such forms as the Commissioner shall designateto the employer and to employees whose excess contributions are recharacterizedunder this paragraph (f)(3); and(<T3>2</T3>) Timely taking such other action as the Commissioner shall require;and(B) The plan administrator must account for such amounts as contributionsby the employee for purposes of sections 72 and 6047.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For purposes of section 401(a)(4) and paragraph (b) of this section,recharacterized excess contributions are to be treated as employee contributions.For all other purposes under the Code, however, including sections 404,409, 411, 412, 415, 416, and 417, and, with respect recharacterized excesscontributions for plan years which begin after December 31, 1988, section401(k)(2), recharacterized excess contributions continue to be treatedas employer contributions that are elective contributions. Thus, for example,recharacterized excess contributions remain subject to the requirementsof paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section; must be deducted under section404; and are treated as employer contributions described in section 415(c)(2)(A)and andSection; 1.415-6(b). In addition, these amounts are not treated ascompensation for purposes of sections 404 and 415, and may be treated ascompensation for purposes of sections 401(a)(4), 401(a)(5), 401(k), 401(l)and 414(s) only to the extent that elective contributions may be treated,and are treated under the plan, as compensation. Recharacterized excesscontributions which relate to plan years ending on or before October 24,1988 may be treated as either employer contributions or employee contributionsfor purposes of paragraph (d) of this section.(iii) <T3>Additional requirements</T3>_(A) <T3>Time of recharacterization</T3>. Excess contributions may not be recharacterizedunder this subparagraph after the later of (<T3>1</T3>) two and one-half months after the close of the plan year towhich the recharacterization relates, or (<T3>2</T3>) October 24, 1988. Recharacterization will be deemed to haveoccurred on the date on which the last of those highly compensated employeeswith excess contributions to be recharacterized is notified in accordancewith paragraph (f)(3)(ii). Such notification may be provided by such meansas the Commissioner may designate.(B) [Reserved.](C) [Reserved.](iv) <T3>Transition rules</T3>. If amounts recharacterized for any plan yearwere not previously included in income, they are to be treated as receivedby employees for income tax purposes on the first day of the first planyear ending in 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">If notice of recharacterization is provided to the affected highlycompensated employees by October 24, 1988, recharacterization is deemedto have occurred 2\1/2\ months after the close of the plan year and thepenalty tax of section 4979 will not be imposed. The rules in this subdivision(iv) are effective only for plan years which end on or before August 8,1988.(v) <T3>Example.</T3> The principles of this paragraph (f)(3) are illustratedby the following example:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example.</T3> (i) Employer X maintains Plan Y, a calendar year profit-sharingplan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement. Under PlanY, each eligible employee may elect to defer up to 10 percent of his compensationunder a salary reduction agreement. These are the only contributions tothe plan. X pays the amounts deferred under the arrangement to the trustunder Plan Y each month on the last day of the month. Salaries are paidon the same date.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) In January 1989, X determines that, during 1988, the compensationand actual deferral percentages (ADPs) of X's six employees were as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,s25,7,6,5</C> <H1>Employee</H1><H1>Compensation (A)</H1><H1>Elective contribution (B)</H1><H1>ADP (B/A)(percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">A<D>$70,000</D><D>$7,000</D><D>10.00 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">B<D>60,000</D><D>4,500</D><D>7.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">C<D>20,000</D><D>1,000</D><D>5.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">D<D>15,000</D><D>0</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">E<D>10,000</D><D>350</D><D>3.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">F<D>10,000</D><D>350</D><D>3.50</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ADP for X's highly compensated employees, A and B, is 8.75 percent(10.00% + 7.50% \2\). The ADP for X's other employees is three percent(5.00 percent) + 0% + 3.50% + 3.50%)/4). Because 8.75 percent is more than2.0 times three percent and more than three percent plus two percent, theplan fails to satisfy paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Plan Y provides that each highly compensated participant willhave his excess contributions, as defined in paragraph (g)(13) of thissection, recharacterized. The amount to be so treated will be determinedaccording to the method described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) In order to satisfy paragraph (b)(4) of this section, Plan Ymust reduce the ADP for X's highly compensated employees to not more thanfive percent. This will satisfy the test described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)of this section, because five percent is not more than 2.0 times threepercent and is not more than two percentage points greater than three percent.Plan Y does this by reducing A's ADP to 7.5 percent (the ADP of the highlycompensated employee having the next highest ADP). Since this is not sufficientto satisfy the ADP test in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, the ADPof both A and B must be reduced to five percent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(v) The maximum dollar amount that may be deferred by each employeeis determined by using the formula D = (ADP andmultiply; S) where D is themaximim allowable deferral, ADP is the reduced ADP, and S is the compensation.Thus, A's maximum allowable deferral is $3,500 (.50 andmultiply; $70,000),and B's maximum allowable deferral is $3,000 (.05 andmultiply; $60,000).The balance of the original deferrals by A and B ($3,500 and $1,500 respectively)must be included in their taxable wages for 1988, the year in which X wouldhave paid cash to A and B.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(vi) A deferred $583.33 per month, except for January, February, March,and April, when he deferred $583.34. Pursuant to the first-in, first-outrule in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this paragraph, the deferrals made in January,February, March, April, May, and June as well as $.02 of the deferral madein July, are treated as employee contributions. A similar procedure isundertaken with respect to B. X and the plan administrator provide A andB with such forms and notices as the Commissioner may require. If A andB had already filed income tax returns for 1988, they must file amendedreturns. In addition, the plan administrator must satisfy paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B)of this section.</ITAG>(g) <T3>Definitions.</T3> For purposes of this section, the following definitionsshall apply:(1) <T3>Employee.</T3> The term ``employee'' means an individual who performsservices for the employer and who is either a common law employee of theemployer or a self-employed individual treated as an employee pursuantto section 401(c)(1). The term ``employee'' also includes a leased employeewho is treated as an employee of the employer-recipient pursuant to theprovisions of section 414(n)(2) or 414(o)(2) other than individuals coveredby a plan described in section 414(n)(5). Individuals that an employertreats as leased employees under section 414(n), pursuant to the requirementsof section 414(o), are considered to be leased employees for purposes ofthis rule.(2) <T3>Employer.</T3> The term ``employer'' means the employer maintainingthe plan and those employers required to be aggregated with such employerunder sections 414(b), (c), (m), or (o).(3) <T3>Eligible employee</T3>_(i) <T3>In general.</T3> The term ``eligible employee'' means an employee whois directly or indirectly eligible to make a cash or deferred electionunder the plan for all or a portion of the plan year. For example, if anemployee must perform certain acts in order to be eligible to make a cashor deferred election for a plan year, such employee is an eligible employeefor such plan year without regard to whether the employee performs suchacts. An employee is an eligible employee if he is unable to make a cashor deferred election merely because his compensation is less than a stateddollar amount.(ii) <T3>Certain one-time elections.</T3> An employee is not an eligible employeemerely because such employee, upon commencing employment with the employeror upon the employee's first becoming eligible to make a cash or deferredelection under any arrangement of the employer, is given the one-time opportunityto elect, and such employee did in fact elect, not to be eligible to makea cash or deferred election under such plan or any other plan maintainedby the employer (including plans not yet established) for the durationof the employee's employment with the employer.(4) <T3>Elective contributions.</T3> The term ``elective contributions'' meansemployer contributions made to a plan that were subject to a cash or deferredelection under a cash or deferred arrangement (whether or not such arrangementis a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under paragraph (a)(4)). Noamount that has become currently available to an employee or that is designatedor treated, at the time of deferral or contribution, as an after-tax contributionmay be treated as an elective contribution. See paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3).(5) <T3>Nonelective contributions.</T3> The term ``nonelective contributions''means employer contributions (other than matching contributions) with respectto which the employee may not elect to have the contributions paid to theemployee in cash or other benefits instead of being contributed to theplan.(6) <T3>Matching contributions.</T3> The term ``matching contributions'' meansemployer contributions made to a plan on behalf of an employee on accountof employee contributions or elective contributions of such employee.(7) <T3>Qualified matching contributions and qualified nonelective contributions</T3>_(i)<T3>Qualified matching contributions.</T3> The term ``qualified matchingcontributions'' means matching contributions that satisfy the additionalrequirements of paragraph (g)(7)(iii) of this section.(ii) <T3>Qualified nonelective contributions.</T3> The term ``qualified nonelectivecontributions'' means employer contributions, other than elective contributionsand matching contributions, that satisfy the additional requirements ofparagraph (g)(7)(iii) of this section.(iii) <T3>Additional requirements.</T3> Except to the extent that paragraphs(c) and (d) of this section specifically provide otherwise, the matchingcontributions and the nonelective contributions must satisfy the requirementsof paragraphs (c) and (d) as though such contributions were elective contributionswithout regard to whether such contributions are actually taken into accountas elective contributions under paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3).(8) <T3>Actual deferral percentage</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule.</T3> The actual deferral percentage for the group ofeligible highly compensated employees, as well as the actual deferral percentagefor the group of other eligible employees, for a plan year is the averageof the actual deferral ratios, calculated separately for each employeein the group, of the amount of elective contributions (including qualifiednonelective contributions and qualified matching contributions treatedas elective contributions under paragraph (b)(3)) made on behalf of eachemployee for the plan year to the employee's compensation for the planyear. For plan years which begin after December 31, 1988, or such laterdate provided in paragraph (h) of this section, such actual deferral ratiosand the actual deferral percentage for each group shall be calculated tothe nearest one-hundredth of one percent of the employee's compensation.The actual deferral ratio of an eligible employee who makes no electivecontribution is zero.(ii) <T3>Employee eligible under more than one arrangement.</T3> In the caseof an employee who is eligible to participate in more than one cash ordeferred arrangement of the same employer, the actual deferral ratio shallbe calculated by treating all the cash or deferred arrangements in whichthe employee is eligible to participate as one arrangement. For example,if an employee with compensation of $80,000 may make elective contributionsunder two separate cash or deferred arrangements, the actual deferral ratiofor such employee under each arrangement is to be calculated by dividingthe total elective contributions by the employee under both arrangementsby $80,000. This paragraph (g)(8)(ii) is effective for plan years beginningafter December 31, 1984. For plan years which begin after December 31,1986, or such later date provided under paragraph (h) of this section,this paragraph (g)(8)(ii) shall apply only to employees who are highlycompensated employees. See paragraph (b)(5) of this section for the treatmentof certain multiple plans and cash or deferred arrangements.(9) <T3>Compensation</T3>_(i) <T3>Years before January 1, 1987</T3>_(A) <T3>In general. </T3>An employee's compensation for a plan year beginningbefore January 1, 1987, or such later date provided under paragraph (h)of this section, is the amount taken into account under the plan (or plans)in calculating the elective contribution that may be made on behalf ofthe employee. In a plan that is top-heavy (as defined in section 416),such compensation may not exceed $200,000. Compensation may not excludeamounts less than a stated amount, such as the integration level underthe plan. Compensation may include all compensation for the plan year,including compensation for the period when an employee was ineligible tomake a cash or deferred election.(B) <T3>Nondiscrimination. </T3>(<T3>1</T3>) If the plan's definition of compensation has the effect ofdiscriminating in favor of employees who are highly compensated, a nondiscriminatorydefinition shall be determined by the Commissioner.(<T3>2</T3>) A plan's definition of compensation will be treated as nondiscriminatoryif the plan defines compensation for a plan year either as (<T3>i</T3>) an employee's total nondeferred compensation includible ingross income plus elective contributions under the plan and/or electivecontributions under a plan described in section 125 or (<T3>ii</T3>) an employee's W-2 or total nondeferred compensation includiblein gross income.(ii) <T3>Years after December 31, 1986. </T3>For plan years which begin afterDecember 31, 1986, or such later date provided in paragraph (h) of thissection, ``compensation'' has the meaning given such term by section 414(s).For plan years beginning after December 31, 1988, or on or after the laterdate provided under paragraph (h) of this section, the applicable periodunder section 414(s) for purposes of applying section 401(k) and this sectionis the plan year for which a determination under paragraph (b) is beingmade.(10) <T3>Highly compensated employees. </T3>(i) For plan years which begin afterDecember 31, 1979, and before January 1, 1987, or such later date providedunder paragraph (h) of this section, for purposes of the actual deferralpercentage test, highly compensated employees are the one-third of alleligible employees (rounded to the nearest integer) who receive the mostcompensation. When one or more employees of a group would be highly compensatedemployees except that each member of the group receives the same amountof compensation, the employer shall designate which employees of the groupare highly compensated, so that one-third of all eligible employees areconsidered highly compensated.(ii) For plan years beginning after December 31, 1986, or such later dateprovided under paragraph (h) of this section, the term ``highly compensatedemployee'' has the meaning given such term by section 414(q).(11) <T3>Pre-ERISA money purchase pension plan.</T3> (i) A pre-ERISA money purchasepension plan is a pension plan_(A) That is a defined contribution plan (as defined in section 414(i));(B) That was in existence on June 27, 1974, and as in effect on that date,included a salary reduction agreement described in paragraph (a)(3) ofthis section; and(C) Under which neither the employee contributions nor the employer contributions,including elective contributions, may exceed the levels (as a percentageof compensation) provided for by the contribution formula in effect onJune 27, 1974.(ii) A plan was in existence on June 27, 1974, if it was a written planadopted on or before that date, even if no funds had yet been paid to thetrust associated with the plan.(12) <T3>Rural electric cooperative plan. </T3>For purposes of this section,a rural electric cooperative plan is a plan described in section 401(k)(7).(13) <T3>Excess contributions. </T3>The term ``excess contributions'' means,with respect to a plan year, the excess of the elective contributions,including qualified nonelective contributions and qualified matching contributionsthat are treated as elective contributions under paragraphs (b)(2) and(b)(3), on behalf of eligible highly compensated employees for the planyear over the maximum amount of such contributions permitted under paragraphs(b)(2) and (b)(4). The amount of excess contributions for each highly compensatedemployee is determined by using the method described in paragraph (f)(2)of this section.(h) <T3>Effective dates</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as otherwise provided, in this paragraph (h),or as specifically provided elsewhere in this section, this section shallapply to plan years beginning after December 31, 1979.(2) <T3>Collectively bargained plans. </T3>In the case of a plan maintainedpursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements between employeerepresentatives and one or more employers ratified before March 1, 1986,(i) The provisions of this section first effective for plan years whichbegin after December 31, 1986, shall not apply to years which begin beforethe earlier of_(A) The date on which the last of such collective bargaining agreementsterminates (determined without regard to any extension thereof after February28, 1986), or(B) January 1, 1989; and(ii) The provisions of this section first effective for plan years whichbegin after December 31, 1988, shall not apply to years which begin beforethe earlier of_(A) The later of_(<T3>1</T3>) January 1, 1989, or,(<T3>2</T3>) The date on which the last of such collective bargaining agreementsterminates (determined without regard to any extension thereof after February28, 1986) or(B) January 1, 1991.(3) <T3>Transitional rules. </T3>(i) See andSection; 1.402(a)-1(d)(3) for a transitionalrule applicable to cash or deferred arrangements in existence on June 27,1974.(ii) For plan years beginning after December 31, 1979 (or, in the caseof a pre-ERISA money purchase plan, plan years beginning after July 18,1984) and before January 1, 1988, a reasonable interpretation of the rulesset forth in section 401(k) of the Code (as in effect during those years)may be relied upon to determine whether a cash or deferred arrangementwas qualified during those years. Operation in accordance with the proposedregulations published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 10, 1981, 46 FR 55544, will be deemeda reasonable interpretation of section 401(k).(4) <T3>Transitional rules for plans of state and local governments. </T3>(i)A plan adopted by a state or local government prior to May 6, 1986, thatis not a collectively bargained plan is subject to the transitional rulesof paragraphs (h)(4) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section.(ii) For plan years beginning before January 1, 1989, the plan is subjectto the ADP test in section 401(k)(3) prior to its amendment by section1116(a) of TRA '86. For plan years beginning after December 31, 1988, theplan is subject to the ADP test in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.(iii) (A) For plan years beginning before January 1, 1989, in the caseof an employee who is eligible to participate in more than one cash ordeferred arrangement of the same employer, the actual deferral percentageshall be calculated by treating all cash or deferred arrangements in whichthe employer is eligible to participate as one cash or deferred arrangement.(B) For plan years beginning after the December 31, 1988, in the case ofa highly compensated employee who is eligible to participate in more thanone cash or deferred arrangement of the same employer, the actual deferralpercentage shall be calculated by treating all cash or deferred arrangementsin which the high-compensated employee is eligible to participate as onecash or deferred arrangement.(iv) For plan years beginning before January 1, 1989, the plan must usethe definition of ``highly compensated employee'' contained in paragraph(g)(10)(i) of this section, and the definition of compensation containedin paragraph (g)(9)(i) of this section. For plan years which begin afterDecember 31, 1988, the plan must use the definitions of ``highly compensatedemployee'' and ``compensation'' contained in sections 414(q) and (s), respectively,for purposes of the participation and discrimination standards of paragraph(b) of this section and must follow the rules pertaining to compensationin paragraph (g)(9)(ii) of this section.(v) In the case of a plan that is maintained pursuant to one or more collectivebargaining agreements between employee representatives and one or moreemployers adopted by a state or local government prior to May 6, 1986,the provisions in paragraphs (h)(4) (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this sectionand other provisions of this section that would be subject to paragraph(h)(2) if they were not a state or local plan described above, effectivefor plan years beginning after December 31, 1988, shall not apply to yearsbeginning before the earlier of_(A) The later of_(<T3>1</T3>) January 1, 1989, or (<T3>2</T3>) The date on which the last such collective bargaining agreementsterminates (determined without regard to any extension thereof after February28, 1986), or(B) January 1, 1991.Par. 5. Section 1.402(a)-1 is amended by adding a new paragraph (d) toread as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.402(a)-1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Taxability of beneficiary under a trust which meets the requirementsof section 401(a).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(d) <T3>Salary reduction, cash or deferred arrangements</T3>_(1) <T3>Inclusion in income. </T3>Whether a contribution to an exempt trustor plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) is made by the employer orthe employee must be determined on the basis of the particular facts andcircumstances of each case. Nevertheless, an amount contributed to planor trust will, except as otherwise provided under paragraph (d)(2) of thissection, be treated as contributed by the employee if such amount was contributedat the employee's election, even though the election was made before theyear in which the amount was earned by the employee or before the yearin which the amount has become currently available to the employee. Anyamount treated as contributed by the employee is includible in the grossincome of the employee for the year in which the amount would have beenreceived by the employee but for the election. Thus, for example, if amountsare contributed to an exempt trust or plan by reason of a salary reductionagreement under a cash or deferred arrangement, such amounts are treatedas received by the employee at such time as such amounts would have beenreceived by the employee but for the election to defer, and thus are includiblein the gross income of the employee for the year that includes such time(except as provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section). A matchingcontribution described in section 401(m)(4) is not treated as an employeecontribution merely because it is made by the employer as a result of theemployee's election.

See andSection;1.401(k)-1(g) for definitions and restrictions applicable to this paragraph(d)(2).(3) <T3>Effective date and transitional rule.</T3> (i) In the case of a planor trust that does not include a salary reduction or cash or deferred arrangementin existence on June 27, 1974, this paragraph applies to taxable yearsending after such date. (ii) In the case of a plan or trust that includes a salary reduction ora cash or deferred arrangement in existence on June 27, 1974, this paragraphapplies to plan years beginning after December 31, 1979 (or, in the caseof pre-ERISA money purchase plan, as defined in andSection; 1.401(k)-1(g),plan years beginning after July 18, 1984). For plan years of such plansor trusts beginning prior to January 1, 1980 (or, in the case of pre-ERISAmoney purchase plan, plan years beginning before July 19, 1984), the taxableyear of inclusion in gross income of the employee of any amount so contributedby the employer to the trust shall be determined in a manner consistentwith Rev.
