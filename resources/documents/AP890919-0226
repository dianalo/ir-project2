The commission, in affirming a 1988 preliminary ruling againstIntercambio of San Jose, Calif., said Monday the company had notprevented minors from listening to the adult material and had notprevented interstate telephone calls.   The commission's investigation ``found the evidence conclusivethat Intercambio's messages were obscene and that it had in factoperated and was continuing to operate in violation of'' the law,the FCC said.   Interstate dial-a-porn calls to minors are banned under federallaw.   The commission gave Intercambio 30 days to pay the fine or facecriminal action.   The FCC said the complaint that prompted the investigation camein 1987 from a woman who said her 16-year-old son was dialing thephone service.   According to a commission report, the mother said her son placedmore than 280 calls to various dial-a-porn numbers during a 2{-monthperiod and was seeing a psychiatrist. The commission said the boylistened to Intercambio's messages six times between July andSeptember 1987.   In its defense, the company told the FCC its service was intendedonly for California and it had attempted to restrict access tominors. The company also said the law and FCC rules on pornographicphone messages were unconstitutional.   But it did not provide evidence to back up its claims, accordingto Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis.   There was no phone number listed for Intercambio in San Jose andattempts to locate a number for Intercambio's president, DanGlassoff, were unsuccessful Monday.   Congress last year attempted to wipe out the dial-a-porn industryby outlawing the sale of indecent phone messages. But the SupremeCourt in June said only obscene material _ patently offensive,sexual and without redeeming value _ may be banned.   Congress acted because of complaints from outraged parents whoincurred heavy phone bills from children dialing the 976 numbersassociated with sexually-oriented material.   But the Supreme Court said recent technological advances assuredchildren could be kept out the reach of dial-a-porn services and thegovernment had no compelling reason to ban such calls for adults.   The $600,000 fine was the same as one the FCC assessed anotherCalifornia company last year for transmitting obscene phonemessages. But Mary Beth Hess, chief of the FCC's enforcementdivision, said Monday that Audio Enterprises of Mill Valley, Calif.,paid a $50,000 fine and agreed to stop selling sexual phone messageswhile admitting no liability.   A third company, 2001 Enterprises of Reseda, Calif., has alsoagreed to stop its sexually-oriented message business after payingthe government $25,000, Hess said.</TEXT></DOC>
