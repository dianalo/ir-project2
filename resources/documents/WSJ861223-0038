In the latest development in a tangle of bankruptcy-court cases in Denver, a judge made a preliminary ruling that temporarily permits Frontier to maintain control of airport gates and hangars that United bought during its unsuccessful bid to acquire Frontier from People Express Inc.    Texas Air Corp., which subsequently agreed to purchase People Express and Frontier and is operating the gates through its Continental Airlines unit, hopes to buy the assets from Frontier and relegate United to the crowd of creditors hoping for a favorable settlement in Frontier's bankruptcy-law proceedings.    United withdrew its claim in one court case after the ruling Friday, but will again seek control of the assets in a related litigation in the same court in April.    &quot;Texas Air, in another outrageous position, thinks it can buy something from someone (Frontier) who doesn't even own it,&quot; said Glen E. Keller Jr., a lawyer for United.    &quot;We've paid $43 million and we believe we're the rightful owners,&quot; added a spokesman for Chicago-based UAL Inc., United's parent.    But Houston-based Texas Air, whose recent spate of acquisitions has enabled it to pass United as the nation's largest airline, said it believes the bankruptcy-court ruling last Friday gave it the upper hand in the ownership dispute.    The dispute had its beginnings last July, when United agreed to buy Frontier from People Express, a Newark, N.J., airline holding company, for $146 million. That transaction unraveled when United failed to reach an agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association. But in the meantime, United had advanced Frontier and People Express $43 million in exchange for ownership of six gates and two hangars at Denver's Stapleton Airport, three gates at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, and four at Chicago's O'Hare Airport.    Following United's unsuccessful bid, Frontier, broke and without a buyer, filed for bankruptcy-law protection from its creditors. The transfer of the assets was automatically frozen by the filing of the Chapter 11 petition.    Then in September, Texas Air agreed to acquire People Express and what remained of Frontier. While the gates paid for by United were not part of that transaction, Continental Airlines entered into a lease with Frontier that gave Continental use of the gates and hangars.    As a Texas Air unit, Frontier maintains that it should retain the assets -- and that Texas Air should be free to bid on them. And Texas Air has offered $55 million, a handsome improvement on United's price.    The entire dispute has landed in the court of Judge Charles Matheson in Denver. The judge's ruling last Friday came on United's request seeking to prevent Frontier from retaining the assets. In the separate, related litigation, Frontier is suing to nullify its initial $43 million transaction with United.    Texas Air's acquisition of People Express is subject to approval by People Express holders at a meeting Monday.    Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors while it attempts to reorganize. </TEXT></DOC>
