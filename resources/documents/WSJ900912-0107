Law-enforcement agencies in Boston have hooked up theirversion of the Batphone. If you see wrongdoing, day or night,call 1-800-SOS-FRAUD.</LP><TEXT>   Is the city about to have a crime wave?   Absolutely. But, up here, they call it public works.   Boston, a city with a glorious past of public corruption,is on the brink of its two largest-ever public-worksprojects: the $6 billion cleanup of Boston Harbor and the $5billion construction of an underground central-artery roadwayand a tunnel to the airport.   Though the harbor cleanup is just under way, and thecentral-artery construction has yet to begin, a task force ofnine law-enforcement agencies, ranging from the FederalBureau of Investigation to the U.S. Postal InspectionService, has assembled a first-strike capability to ferretout corruption -- as soon as it begins.   &quot;Over the next 10 years, $11 billion will be spent onthese two giant projects -- an amount of cash that willinvite a measure of theft, fraud and corruption,&quot; saysAssistant U.S. Attorney Ralph Gants, who is heading the taskforce. &quot;We see the task force and hot line as prudentforesight.&quot;   Yesterday, the task force held a news conference to showoff hot-line posters to be hung at job sites and to announcean advertising campaign to trumpet 1-800-SOS-FRAUD innewspapers, magazines, radio and television.   Mr. Gants, who believes this is the first hot line todetect -- and, it is hoped, deter -- fraudulent activity,acknowledges that the media campaign is bound to rufflefeathers.   On that, there's some agreement.   &quot;Once they take care of the Sandamp;L scandal, they can worryabout some construction worker stealing a two-by-four,&quot; saysMark Erlich of the Massachusetts Building Trades Council, whois especially miffed that the hot-line ad features a photo ofa construction worker. &quot;Better they should show a contractorin a blue suit or some sleazy developer.&quot;   Meanwhile, operators are on duty. Mr. Gants says agenciesin the task force will rotate covering the phones. Postalinspector John Burns reports two calls yesterday after radiostations publicized the number. &quot;Real calls,&quot; he saysgleefully, &quot;both possible leads.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
