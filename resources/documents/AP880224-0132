It banned several front leaders individually from working forthe organization, writing articles, giving speeches or grantinginterviews. It also ordered that the main black labor federation,the militant Congress of South African Trade Unions, limit itsactivities only to labor issues and stay out of politics.   ``The government has declared war against all peacefulopposition,'' said Azhar Cachalia, treasurer of the UnitedDemocratic Front and one of its few leaders not in detention. Thefront represents more than 600 anti-apartheid organizations withmore than 2 million members.   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel PeacePrize for his fight against apartheid, also said many SouthAfricans would see the restrictions as a ``declaration of war.''   ``The government's idea of reform is to smash all effectivepossible political opposition in the country, no matter howpeaceful and lawful, and to rule with a jackboot,'' Tutu said. Heappealed to the United States and other Western countries tointensify economic pressure on South Africa.   The restrictions, announced in a special government gazette, donot technically outlaw the front and the other groups, buteffectively ban them by prohibiting them from carrying on anyactivities not approved by Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok.   The crackdown affects virtually all of the largest militantblack political groups in South Africa and appears aimed ateliminating competition for black moderates willing to accept theconcept of white political control.   The co-president of the United Democratic Front, Archie Gumede,was taken away by police from his office in Durban, served withindividual banning orders and released, colleagues said. AlbertinaSisulu, the other co-president, was barred from leaving her homebetween 6 p.m. and 5 a.m. and also was affected by the new orders.   The United States, in a statement issued in Washington andPretoria, said it was ``appalled'' by the ban. ``By acting tooutlaw the non-violent political activity of these organizations,the South African government dealt a severe blow to efforts toachieve a peaceful solution to South Africa's problem. It is agiant step backward for South Africa,'' said the statement issuedby the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria.   Britain, the staunchest opponent of sanctions against SouthAfrica, condemned the crackdown. Foreign Secretary Sir GeoffreyHowe said the ``oppressive'' restrictions could breed more violence.   The Rev. Allan Boesak, a co-founder of the front, said thegovernment had acted out of frustration because its tough tacticsduring a 20-month-old state of emergency had failed to quellmilitant opposition.   ``It is not possible, really, to ban the UDF,'' he said in atelephone interview. ``The UDF is much less an organization than asymbol of the determination of South Africa's oppressed people tobe free.''   He said one of the government's aims was to crush organizationsthat planned to call for a boycott of black municipal electionsscheduled for October. If the United Democratic Front was unable topromote a boycott, he said, he would do so personally.   Under the restrictions, the organizations will be permitted tomaintain bank accounts, perform administrative functions, andundertake legal action. But no other activities will be permittedunless authorized by Vlok.   Several of the affected groups said they would challenge the neworders in court.   Vlok, who signed the order, said the regulations ``willcontribute to a climate of stability, peaceful coexistence and goodneighborliness among all population groups.''   He said the groups affected by the regulations encouraged civildisobedience and rebellion, advocated alternatives structures toreplace official ones, and waged campaigns of intimidation.   Anti-apartheid activists had anticipated some type of crackdownthis year, suggesting that President P.W. Botha's National Partygovernment would move to blunt criticism from extreme-right whiteopponents.   The order comes exactly a week before two parliamentaryby-elections in which candidates from the far-right ConservativeParty are favored to beat National Party candidates. TheConservatives oppose even the limited racial reforms implemented byBotha over the past few years.   In addition to the United Democratic Front, groups affected bythe ban include:   _The Azanian People's Organization, the largest group espousingthe black consciousness philosophy pioneered by Steve Biko, anactivist who died in police custody in 1977.   _The National Education Crisis Committee, which has sought topromote ``people's education'' in which black communities wouldexercise greater control over their schools.   _The Detainees Parents Support Committee, which monitorsdetentions and provides support for relatives of people detainedwithout charge.   _The Soweto Civic Assoiciation, the main anti-apartheidcommunity group in the country's largest black township and a keyfactor behind the rent boycott which has persisted there for nearlytwo years.   Other affected groups include local and regional youth andcommunity organizations and the Release Mandela Committee, a groupwhich campaigns for the release of jailed African National Congressleader Nelson Mandela.   The black trade union congress, known as COSATU, said Vlok'sorder ``has turned the clock back to the days of absolute controland no democracy.''   ``The order demonstrates that the government is completelyincompetent,'' said COSATU's spokesman, Frank Meintjies. ``The endresult is going to be conflict, fear and uncertainty.''   The country's 5 million whites control the government andeconomy and maintain segregated living areas, schools andhospitals. The 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
