The company wouldn't identify the possible buyers and said no proposals have yet been received. May also wouldn't give details of the size of the reserves, but the company said in an earlier filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that total net property and equipment as of Dec. 31 was valued at $40.3 million. Total assets at that time were $64.5 million.    May said that if it sells the reserves it plans to retain undeveloped properties and to continue oil and gas exploration. </TEXT></DOC>
