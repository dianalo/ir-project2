The industry already has a variety ofstandards committees ironing out issues as troublesome as those involvinglaw.andM;Such guidelines could then be presented as expert witness to the judiciaryand lawmakers alike.andP;  Perhaps then, with intelligently formulated laws andguidelines, the legal system could catch up to the significant minutiae ofcomputer law.andP;  And maybe, just maybe, we can go about our business with lessfear, uncertainty and doubt.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
