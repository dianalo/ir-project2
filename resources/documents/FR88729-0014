Authority EPA publishes this rule pursuant to sections 322, 323, and 328 of the EmergencyPlanning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (also known as Title IIIor the Act), of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA)of 1986, Pub. L. 99-499. Section 322 provides the procedures for claimingtrade secrecy and confidentiality for information submitted under sections303 (d)(2) and (d)(3), 311, 312 and 313 of the Act. It also provides aprocess whereby members of the public can file petitions requesting thedisclosure of chemical identities claimed as trade secret. Section 323provides procedures for access to chemical identities, including thoseclaimed as trade secret, by health professionals who need the informationfor diagnosis, treatment, or research. B. Background of this Rulemaking The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-499,signed into law on October 17, 1986, amends and reauthorizes portions ofthe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Actof 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9601 <T3>et seq. </T3>Title III contains the Emergency Planning and CommunityRight-to-Know Act of 1986, which is itself a free-standing statute. Itcontains provisions requiring facilities to report to State and local authorities,and EPA, the presence, use and release of extremely hazardous substances(described in sections 302 and 304), and hazardous and toxic chemicals(described in sections 311, 312, and 313 respectively). For the reportingrequired in sections 303, 311, 312 and 313, a submitter may under certaincircumstances claim the identity of the chemical reported as trade secret.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Section 303 </ITAG>Section 303 involves the formulation of comprehensive emergency responseplans for extremely hazardous substances. These are any of the substanceson a list published by EPA under section 302. The regulations implementingsection 303 (and, because of their relationship, sections 302 and 304)were published on April 22, 1987, at 52 FR 13378, codified at 40 CFR Part355. On December 17, 1987, the Agency deleted three of the substances fromthe Extremely Hazardous Substances List, and on February 25, 1988, theAgency deleted an additional 36. These deletions were published in rulemakingsat 52 FR 48072 and 53 FR 5574, respectively. Any facility where an extremely hazardous substance under section 302 ispresent in excess of the threshold quantity (as determined by EPA) mustreport to the State emergency response commission, established under section301 of the Act. The local emergency planning committee (LEPC), also establishedunder section 301 of the Act, will contact any facility that has identifieditself in order to formulate a local emergency contingency plan. In thisplanning process, a facility is required to provide the local emergencyplanning committee with information the committee requests, except thatthe facility may withhold trade secret chemical identity from the committee.The facility must also inform the committee of any relevant changes whichoccur or are expected to occur which may affect the contingency plan. Wheninforming the committee of these changes, the facility may also withholdtrade secret chemical identity from the committee. Trade secret claimsfor chemical identities withheld from facility reports must be substantiatedaccording to the requirements of this regulation. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Sections 311 and 312 </ITAG>Section 311 requires the owner or operator of facilities subject to theOccupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) and regulations promulgatedunder that Act (25 U.S.C. 651 <T3>et seq. </T3>as amended, 52 FR 31852, August 24, 1987) to submit materialsafety data sheets (MSDS), or a list of the chemicals for which the facilityis required to have an MSDS, to the local emergency planning committees,State emergency response commissions, and local fire departments. The facilitieswere required to submit the MSDS or alternative list by October 17, 1987,or three months after the facility is required to prepare or have an MSDSfor a hazardous chemical under OSHA regulations, whichever is later. Inaddition, a revised MSDS or list must be submitted to the LEPC within threemonths following the discovery of significant new information concerningan aspect of a hazardous chemical for which an MSDS or list was previouslysubmitted. Facilities in the non-manufacturing sector will be requiredto submit the MSDS or alternative list when the OSHA Hazard CommunicationStandard (HCS) is expanded to cover the nonmanufacturing sector. Any tradesecret chemical identity may be withheld from the MSDS or list of chemicals,provided the submitter follows the trade secret claims procedures underthe section 322 regulation. Under section 312, owners and operators of facilities that must submitan MSDS under section 311 are also required to submit additional informationon the hazardous chemicals present at the facility. Beginning March 1,1988, and annually thereafter, the owner or operator of such a facilitymust submit an inventory form containing an estimate of the maximum amountof hazardous chemicals present at the facility during the preceding year,an estimate of the average daily amount of hazardous chemicals at the facility,and the location of these chemicals at the facility. Section 312(a) requiresowners or operators of such facilities to submit the inventory form tothe appropriate local emergency planning committee, State emergency responsecommission, and local fire department on or before March 1, 1988, (or Marchl of the first year after the facility first becomes subject to the OSHAMSDS requirements for a hazardous chemical) and annually thereafter onMarch 1. For the non-manufacturing sector, facilities are first requiredto submit an MSDS or alternative list when the HCS is expanded to coverthe non-manufacturing sector; if the expansion becomes effective in 1988,the first Tier I or Tier II reports are required beginning March 1, 1989.Section 312 specifies that there be two reporting ``tiers'' containinginformation on hazardous chemicals at the facility in different levelsof detail. ``Tier I,'' containing general information on the amount andlocation of hazardous chemicals by category, is submitted annually. ``TierII,'' containing more detailed information on individual chemicals, issubmitted upon request by the State or local agencies. There will be notrade secrecy claims for Tier I reporting since no specific chemical identityis required to be given. However, submitters may withhold trade secretchemical identity from the Tier II form, and facilities should be preparedto submit their trade secret claims as appropriate, even if the Tier Ireport is initially submitted.As noted above, the Department of Labor recently published a final HCSrulemaking at 52 FR 31852, on August 24, 1987, expanding coverage of thefacilities required to maintain MSDSs. The number of facilities therebysubject to reporting under sections 311 and 312 will have expanded from350,000 to over 4 million, when the expansion becomes effective. The final rule for sections 311 and 312 was published on October 15, 1987at 52 FR 38344, 40 CFR Part 370. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Section 313 </ITAG>Under section 313, a toxic chemical release inventory form (published byEPA) must be filed with a designated State agency and EPA. This form mustbe filed for any toxic chemical (on a list published by EPA) which is manufactured,processed or otherwise used in amounts exceeding the threshold quantityat a covered facility. The form also indicates the total annual releasesof the chemical to the environment. A covered facility is any facilitywith 10 or more employees in Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Codes20-39. The rule for section 313 was published on February 16, 1988, at53 FR 4500, 40 CFR Part 372. As with other sections of Title III, tradesecret chemical identity may be withheld from the toxic chemical releaseinventory form. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Section 322 </ITAG>The section 322 regulations contain the procedures which a submitter mustfollow in order to file a trade secrecy claim. Trade secrecy claims aresubmitted to EPA only, by including with the appropriate 303, 311, 312or 313 submittals, as explained below, both a sanitized and unsanitizedtrade secret substantiation form. The unsanitized version must containthe chemical identity claimed as trade secret, and the sanitized versionis identical to the unsanitized version in all respects except that thetrade secret chemical identity is deleted, and in its place a generic classor category to describe the chemical is included. This sanitized versionis the one that is submitted to the State or local authorities, as appropriate.Section 322(b) of Title III requires a submitter to substantiate its tradesecrecy claim when submitting the filing containing the chemical identityclaimed as trade secret. This up-front substantiation will consist of theanswers to six questions which are intended to elicit sufficient factualsupport to indicate whether the claim will meet the criteria set forthin the statute for a claim of trade secrecy. In order to fully answer the six questions in the substantiation, a submittermay need to include additional trade secret or other confidential information.The statute in section 322(f) allows submitters to designate as confidentialany information in the substantiation entitled to protection under 18 U.S.C.1905 (the Federal Trade Secrets Act). Claims of confidentiality in thesubstantiation are more expansive in scope than those allowed under thereporting requirements of the Act, and are limited solely to informationnecessary to substantiate the trade secrecy claim. A detailed explanationon how to make a trade secrecy claim for information in the substantiationis found under section II.G. of this Preamble. The section 322 regulation also contains the procedures to be used by thepublic for requesting disclosure of chemical identity claimed as tradesecret. (This public petition process does not cover requests for publicdisclosure of information claimed as trade secret in the substantiationother than chemical identity. These requests for disclosure must be submittedunder EPA's Freedom of Information Act regulations at 40 CFR Part 2.) Thesection 322 regulation also sets forth procedures the Agency must followin making a determination as to whether any trade secrecy claim is valid.These determinations will be made by the program designated to receiveand handle trade secrecy claims for that particular reporting section inTitle III. The Office of General Counsel will hear intra-agency appealsfrom the determinations of trade secrecy. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Section 323 </ITAG>The section 323 regulation contains provisions allowing health professionalsto gain access to chemical identities, including those claimed as tradesecret, in three different situations. The first situation is for non-emergencytreatment and diagnosis of an exposed individual. Second, access is permittedfor emergency diagnosis and treatment. Finally, health professionals employedby a local government may receive access to a trade secret chemical identityto conduct preventive research studies and to render medical treatment.In all situations but the medical emergency, the health professional mustsubmit a written request and a statement of need, as well as a confidentialityagreement, to the facility holding the trade secret. The statement of needverifies that the health professional will be using the trade secret informationonly for the needs permitted in the statute, and the confidentiality agreementensures that the health professional will not make any unauthorized disclosuresof the trade secret. In the event of medical emergency, the health professionalgranted access to chemical identify claimed as trade secret may be requiredto execute a confidentiality agreement. C. Summary of Public Participation EPA issued a proposed rule for trade secrecy claims and for trade secretdisclosures to health professionals, which was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 15, 1987 (52 FR 38312). The proposedrule contained the form for the substantiation to accompany claims of tradesecrecy and requirements for making claims of trade secrecy under the Act.After publication, EPA received over 40 written comments on the proposedrule. In addition, EPA held public meetings in Washington, DC, Chicago,IL, Boston, MA, Dallas, TX, and San Francisco, CA. Attendees at these meetingspresented oral comments representative of a wide range of interests includingthe affected industry, environmental and other public interest groups,State and local governments, and individual citizens. These comments arepart of the official record of this rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Trade Secrecy Claim Procedure </ITAG>A. Definition of Trade Secret <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Overview of Trade Secrecy Claims </ITAG>The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 does notgive facilities blanket authority to withhold any information they considersensitive or confidential. The purpose of the Act is to provide informationto the public, and the statute limits the types of information that maybe withheld as well as the circumstances in which a claim of trade secrecycan be made.Regardless of the basis for a trade secret (e.g., a chemical's presenceat a facility, its use for a particular process, or its production in acertain quantity), the only information that a facility may withhold froman Act's report (other than location information, as explained below) isthe specific chemical identity. When a facility makes a claim of tradesecrecy, it must provide all of the information normally required to bereported with the sole exception of the specific identity of the chemicalbeing claimed as trade secret. Submitters of trade secrecy claims must distinguish two concepts: (1) Whatmay be withheld; and (2) the basis for withholding information. As noted,the only information that may be withheld from a public report is the <T3>identity </T3>of a chemical found at a facility. The basis, or reasons, for considering a chemical identity as a trade secretcan vary. In most instances, the presence of the chemical at a facilityis the basis for a chemical being a trade secret. However, in certain instancesfacilities may believe the connection between the chemical identity andother information that must be included on the Act's reports, such as quantityor process information, may also be a basis for a claim of trade secrecy.For example, a facility may believe that its estimate of the maximum amountof chemical X on site on its toxic chemical reporting form under section313 is a trade secret, even though public knowledge of its use of chemicalX is not. In such a case, the connection or as it is sometimes termed,the linkage, of the chemical identity with the quantity information isthe basis for the facility's trade secrecy claim. However, the facilitymay only withhold the chemical identity (i.e., chemical X in this example);the quantity on site must still be reported. As Congress provided, publicreports would not disclose the specific chemical, although a generic namefor chemical X must be provided as a substitute, as well as data on itshazardous characteristics and adverse health effects. Hence, what can bewithheld is only the chemical identity, but facilities may base their tradesecrecy claims on the connection between the chemical identity and a broaderset of information required on the Act's reports. This discussion, so far, has dealt with trade secrecy claims for chemicalidentity on the reports required under the Act. This is the class of tradesecret claims addressed by the rule. However, two other classes of confidentialinformation are also involved under the Act, and rules for treatment ofthese are different. First, when facilities explain why a chemical is a trade secret, it isrecognized that they may need to cite other confidential information (suchas process or financial data) in their substantiations. The statute andthe rule allow facilities to make claims of confidentiality, explainedbelow, for information they provide on their substantiations accompanyingclaims. Second, location information required under section 312 is considereda separate class of confidential information, and is provided only to Stateand local recipient(s). Section 312 location information should not besent to EPA. The statute does not require facilities to justify the confidentialityof either of these two types of information under section 322. Under section324, copies of the publicly available substantiations for trade secrecyclaims are accessible during normal business hours through the designatedState and local authorities, and through EPA, as appropriate. These substantiationsare also accessible under the Freedom of Information Act, as discussedat section V.C. of this Preamble. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Rationale </ITAG>The definition of a trade secret in this regulation is equivalent to thatin the Restatement of Torts, section 757, and the regulation developedby the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to implement its HazardCommunication Standard, 52 FR 31876 (August 24, 1987), 29 CFR 1910.1200.The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires disclosure of the specificchemical identity of chemicals to which employees are exposed in the workplace,except in those cases in which the identity of the chemical in questioncan be justified by a facility to be a bona fide trade secret. The U.S.Court of Appeals ruling in <T3>United Steelworkers of America v. Auchter, </T3>763 F.2d 728 (3d Cir.1985), required that OSHA amend its Hazard Communication Standard to adopta definition of trade secret that conformed to common law protections.OSHA selected the generally accepted definition provided in the Restatementof Torts, section 757, Comment b (1939), which reads: `` `trade secret'may consist of any formula, pattern, device, or compilation of informationwhich is used in one's business, and which gives [the employer] an opportunityto obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.'' The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 only allowstrade secrecy claims for a subset of the material which is traditionallycovered under trade secrecy law. Section 322(a) specifically states thatsubmitters under Title III may withhold only the ``specific chemical identity(including the chemical name and other specific identification)'' as atrade secret. The ``specific chemical identity'' means either the chemicalname or other specific identification that reveals the precise chemicaldesignation of the substance, such as the Chemical Abstract Services RegistryNumber (CASRN). In the proposed rule, EPA set forth several options for determining thepermissible basis for claims of trade secrecy for specific chemical identity.The most narrow interpretation of the statute would be to limit all claimsof trade secrecy to claims protecting either the composition of the chemical,or the presence of the chemical at the facility. Congress stated in theConference Report that, ``the knowledge of [the] presence [of a specificchemical] at the purchasing facility could effectively define for its competitorsthe process and/or products being made there.'' H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-962,99th Cong., 2d Sess. 304 (1986). The second option set forth in the proposed rule was to allow, as a basisfor a claim of trade secrecy for chemical identity, that the connection,or ``linkage'' between chemical identity and other information on the TitleIII form would reveal the trade secret. Throughout the Conference ReportCongress displayed general concern for the protection of all legitimatetrade secrets. For instance, in discussing the reporting requirements undersection 313, it was noted, ``[t]he conference substitute provides for reportingcategories of use and ranges of chemical present because the exact [identity]of identified chemical[s] at a facility or the exact amount present maydisclose secret processes.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 298. Similarly, in discussing the reporting requirementsunder section 312, Congress stated, ``[i]n order to protect chemical processtrade secret information, reporting ranges may need to be broad.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 290. Congress probably anticipated that it would be possiblefor the Act's reporting forms to be structured broadly enough to avoidcompromising legitimate trade secrets. In the proposed rule, the Agencystated that it was making every effort to do this. EPA believed that evenwith the use of broad ranges and reporting categories, however, the amountof detail requested on the Act's forms would in some cases allow competitorsof submitters to compare and thus to link information, thereby revealingvaluable trade secrets.EPA's proposed interpretation of the basis for a claim of trade secrecyfor chemical identity was supported by several comments from industry voicingconcurrence with Congressional intent to provide trade secret protectionto trade secret information about use, processing, and handling which mightbe linked to corresponding chemical identities reported under sections311, 312, or 313. Industry commenters referred to the definition of tradesecret put forth in the Restatement of Torts to assert that the Agency'slinkage concept is firmly rooted in traditional trade secret law, wheretrade secrecy of chemical identity occurs because of links between thatchemical identity and other data. Consequently, some commenters suggestedthat denial by the Agency of trade secret protection to linked information,and its disclosure to the public, would constitute a taking under the Takingsclause of the Fifth Amendment, even though the specific identities of componentchemicals might be well known to the public. EPA also received some comments from public interest groups which disagreedwith this interpretation. They argued that trade secrecy claims shouldbe restricted solely to claims for the presence or chemical compositionof the chemicals present at a facility, and not allowed for any linkagesbetween chemical identity and other data. These comments claimed that thefour criteria listed under section 322(b) apply only to trade secrecy claimsfor specific chemical identities, and reflect Congressional intent to maximizethe availability of information to the public. One group asserted thattrade secret regulations intended to protect claims for linkage ``willencourage the filing of excessive claims of trade secrecy, as well as claimsthat cannot be substantiated in accordance with section 322(b)'' of thestatute. After carefully considering the comments, the OSHA HCS, the ConferenceReport, and trade secret case law, EPA has decided to allow trade secrecyclaims for chemical identity to be made to protect the linkage betweena specific chemical identity and other information about its use, production,storage, or processing. Such claims will be permitted even in cases whenthe specific chemical identity is already known to the public; however,the submitter will always have to prove that its trade secret meets thefour criteria under section 322(b) by submitting the up-front substantiationdescribed in section II.G. of this Preamble. In all trade secrecy claimsthe specific identities of chemicals present at the facility are the onlyreporting information that may be withheld, in accordance with the statute;all other information requested on the Act's forms must be reported. Generally accepted trade secret law found under the Restatement of Tortsand the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard supports protection of linkageinformation. According to these precedents, confidential information doesnot necessarily depend on public knowledge of one component of a productionprocess; rather, it is often the means by which components are combinedand used which renders the information a protectable trade secret. The Agency believes that this interpretation of the basis for a claim oftrade secrecy will not involve great numbers of additional claims beyondthose that could also be based on the narrower concept of simple presenceat a facility. Submitters of trade secrecy claims for linkage informationwill still have to meet the same four criteria in section 322(b) whichall trade secrecy claims must meet. EPA also believes that this interpretation does not run counter to thepurpose of the Act_that of public disclosure_because the requirement ofan up-front substantiation, which will cause submitters to justify theirclaims, will limit spurious claims. Further, EPA's intention is to routinelyevaluate trade secrecy claims and to vigorously prosecute those submittingfrivolous claims. The $25,000 penalty per frivolous claim under such circumstancesis evidence of Congress intent to deter such claims. All submitters shouldbe aware that supplemental information submitted to EPA after the initialsubstantiation should clearly confirm the validity of their claim as setout in the initial substantiation, or they may be subject to the penaltyfor frivolous claims. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Emission and Effluent Data </ITAG>The Natural Resources Defense Counsel, Citizens for a Better Environment,and OMB Watch have argued in their comments that EPA cannot allow claimsof trade secrecy for data collected on the section 313 toxic release inventoryform because this data is emission or effluent data that is required tobe made public by the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. Section 322(b) of Title III requires that a trade secrecy claimant demonstrate,when making a trade secrecy claim, that the chemical identity claimed astrade secret ``is not required to be disclosed, or otherwise made available,to the public under any other Federal or State law.'' The commenters claimedthat under section 114(c) of the Clean Air Act and section 308(b) of theClean Water Act, emission and effluent data, respectively, are requiredto be made public and, therefore, when collected under Title III must bemade public. Section 114(c) of the Clean Air Act requires that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Any records, reports, or information obtained under [the Clean AirAct] shall be available to the public, except that upon a showing satisfactoryto the Administrator by any person that records, reports, or information,or particular part thereof (<T3>other than emission data</T3>) to which the Administrator has accessunder this section, would divulge methods or processes entitled to protectionas trade secrets * * * the Administrator shall consider such record * ** confidential. (Emphasis added.)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Section 308(b) of the Clean Water Act has a similar provision exceptingeffluent data from confidential treatment. Information which has been determined administratively (by EPA) or judicially(by a court on appeal from an EPA determination) to constitute emissionor effluent data within the meaning of section 114(c) of the Clean AirAct, or section 308(b) of the Clean Water Act is clearly required to bedisclosed to the public and could not be withheld from disclosure undersection 322(b). Thus, a company could not claim as trade secret under TitleIII information which is part of a class of information for which EPA has,by regulation or otherwise, prohibited a claim of business confidentiality,such as information required in National Pollutant Discharge EliminationSystem (NPDES) permit applications. 40 CFR section 122.7(c). Also, a companycould not claim as trade secret under Title III data already collectedby EPA under another statute, such as the Clean Air or Clean Water Acts,where the Agency had decided that the data presented no valid claim oftrade secrecy, either because it was emission or effluent data or for otherreasons, such as, that no valid trade secrecy claim was presented.The question posed by the comments concerns the exact meaning of the priordisclosure language_does this language concern only the circumstances describedabove, where EPA has determined, either generically or specifically, whetherthe information is eligible for trade secret status, or does it also concerncircumstances where the information's trade secret status is undetermined.The commenters argued that information which EPA could obtain, but hasnot requested, under the Clean Air or Clean Water Acts and which couldconstitute emission or effluent data, cannot be claimed as trade secreton the section 313 form or in other Title III submissions. The comments also raised the same question regarding information in EPA'spossession which could constitute emission or effluent data but as to whichno determination has been made. The commenters argued that this informationalso cannot be claimed as trade secret if later submitted under Title III.In so arguing, the commenters assumed that the definitions of emissionand effluent data are self-executing and therefore that no trade secrecyclaims should even be accepted by EPA for information which could be emissionor effluent data. There is no discussion of this issue in the Conference Report or elsewhere;however, EPA's position is that the most probable interpretation is thatCongress intended to prevent trade secret claimants from claiming as secretinformation which was already in the possession of a State or Federal agencyand was required to be disclosed, either because no claim of confidentialitywas permitted under State or Federal law, or because a decision had beenmade that no valid claim was presented. The comments did not address the threshold issue of the definition of emissionor effluent data, merely asserting that EPA's definitions are ``self-executing.''EPA does not consider this definition to be self-executing. The definitionof emission data provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">(2)(i) ``Emission data'' means, with reference to any source of emissionof any substance into the air_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) Information necessary to determine the identity, amount, frequency,concentration, or other characteristics (to the extent related to air quality)of any emission which has been emitted by the source (or of any pollutantresulting from any emission by the source), or any combination of the foregoing;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) Information necessary to determine the identity, amount, frequency,concentration, or other characteristics (to the extent related to air quality)of the emissions which, under an applicable standard or limitation, thesource was authorized to emit (including, to the extent necessary for suchpurposes, a description of the manner or rate of operation of the source);and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) A general description of the location and/or nature of the sourceto the extent necessary to identify the source and to distinguish it fromother sources (including, to the extent necessary for such purposes, adescription of the device, installation, or operation constituting thesource).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">40 CFR 2.301(a)(2)(i) (A), (B), and (C). Whether information constitutes emission or effluent data depends on whatinformation is ``necessary'' to make the needed determination. EPA hasto date made no determinations that categories of information always constituteemissions data. Instead, EPA has proceeded on a case-by-case basis. The regulations interpreting the Clean Water Act contain a similar definitionfor effluent data, information ``necessary to determine the identity ** * or other characteristics * * * of any pollutant which has been dischargedby the source * * *'' 40 CFR 2.302(a)(2)(i). The NPDES regulations underthe Clean Water Act (CWA) do not, however, allow confidential treatmentof information required by, or contained in NPDES permits or permit applications,or of data concerning the discharge of pollutants regulated in the permit,and accordingly, that data is not allowed trade secrecy treatment undersection 313. Submitters claiming this information as confidential may besubject to penalties under section 325(d) for submission of frivolous claims.Submitters should be aware that data submitted on the section 313 formwill be used for activities conducted under the Clean Water Act (includingimplementation of section 304(1) of the Clean Water Act and developmentof NPDES permit limits) and Clean Air Act. EPA is in the process of developinga class determination under 40 CFR 2.207 which would find that information,including chemical identities, submitted on the section 313 form regardingreleases to air or to waters of the United States or to Publicly OwnedTreatment Works, is emission or effluent data under the Clean Air or CleanWater Acts and, as such, is not eligible for confidential treatment undersection 322 of Title III. The commenters also argued that the definition of emission and effluentdata includes not only data which was actually collected under section114(c) and 308(b), but data which ``could have been'' collected under thesesections, citing 40 CFR 2.301(b)(2) and 2.302(b)(2). Thus, the commentersargued that any data which <T3>could </T3>be gathered under the Clean Air Act cannot be claimed tradesecret when submitted to the Agency under section 313. The Clean Air Act regulations at 40 CFR 2.301(b)(2) state:<ITAG tagnum="21">Information will be considered to have been provided or obtained undersection 114 of the Clean Air Act if it was provided in response to a requestby EPA made for any of the purposes stated in section 114, or if its submission<T3>could have been required </T3>under section 114, regardless of whethersection 1l4 was cited as the authority for any request for the information* * * (Emphasis added.)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The comparable section of the Clean Water Act regulations has a similarprovision. See 40 CFR 2.302(b)(2). On this basis, the commenters argued that because the data collected undersection 313 of Title III is emission or effluent data which could havebeen collected under section 114(c) of the Clean Air Act or section 308(b)of the Clean Water Act, no trade secrecy claims can be made for chemicalidentities of chemicals for which emission or effluent data is includedon a Title III submission.The commenters have misconstrued the meaning and function of the ``couldhave been'' language. It serves to prevent submitters from thwarting EPA'sstatutory right to obtain data by voluntarily submitting it to the Agencyfor the use of the Clean Air or Clean Water programs, and then arguing,as voluntarily submitted, that it is not subject to statutory limits ontrade secret or confidential business information. For these reasons, EPA does not agree with the commenters, assertions thatthe provisions of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts render most tradesecrecy claims invalid under section 313. The final rule adopts the interpretationset forth in the proposed rule with respect to the meaning of the languageunder section 322(b), regarding whether information claimed as trade secretis required to be disclosed under another State or federal law. Thus, informationis required to be disclosed under another Federal or State law if:<ITAG tagnum="21">(i) It is information that is specifically or is in a class that isdetermined administratively (by EPA) or judicially (by a court on appealfrom an EPA determination) to constitute emission or effluent data withinthe meaning of section 114(c) of the Clean Air Act or section 308(b) ofthe Clean Water Act; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) It is information which is either specifically or in a classfor which EPA or any other State or Federal Agency has disallowed confidentialtreatment, such as information required by EPA in NPDES permit applications;or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) It is information collected by EPA or another State or FederalAgency where the State or Federal Agency has decided that the data presentedno valid claim of trade secrecy (for any reason). </ITAG>B. Methods of Claiming Trade Secrecy There are five different types of submissions that can be made under TitleIII on which a facility may make a claim of trade secrecy. These are: (1)The notification (to a local emergency planning committee) of any changesat a facility which would affect emergency plans, under section 303(d)(2);(2) answers to questicns posed by local emergency planning committees undersection 303(d)(3); (3) material safety data sheets or chemical lists submittedunder section 311; (4) Tier II emergency and hazardous chemical inventoryforms submitted under section 312; and (5) the toxic release inventoryform submitted under section 313. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Basic Requirements </ITAG>The basic requirements for making a claim are similar, although there aresome differences between submissions under the different sections. Thesedifferences will not affect the validity of a submitter's claim, providedthe submitter adheres to all of the requirements. When fashioning reporting requirements under Title III, EPA has made everyeffort to avoid unnecessary duplication. To this end, when reporting undersection 303 (d)(2) and (d)(3), and under section 311 using an MSDS, EPAonly needs to receive a copy of the submittal sent to the State and localauthorities. This submittal is a public document, and should not containthe specific chemical identity claimed as trade secret. EPA is not requestingan unsanitized version of this submittal. When reporting under section 311 using the list approach, and for all section312 Tier II forms, and section 313 reports, EPA must receive at the sametime both an unsanitized and a sanitized version of the reporting form.A sanitized copy of the reporting form is one in which the chemical identityclaimed as trade secret is deleted and in its place is included the genericclass or category of the chemical claimed trade secret. This sanitizedcopy should be identical to the copy submitted to the appropriate Stateand local organizations in all respects except that it does not containthe chemical identity. Finally, EPA must receive substantiations for each chemical claimed astrade secret under all reporting sections, as explained in section II.G.below. EPA must receive both sanitized and unsanitized versions of thesubstantiation. Although these items are the minimum required for a claimof trade secrecy under all sections, EPA suggests that submitters carefullyreview the requirements under each section before filing a trade secrecyclaim. In this rule, the term ``sanitized'' is used to refer to the copy of thereport or substantiation which does not contain the chemical identity ofthe chemical that is being withheld as trade secret. The term ``unsanitized''refers to a report or substantiation that contains the trade secret chemicalidentity. EPA received some comments from the public objecting to the useof these terms on the grounds that an ``unsanitized'' item is sometimesregarded as ``unclean.'' EPA has decided to retain these terms becausethey are terms of art often used to indicate whether or not these documentscontain information that may be released to the general public; their continueduse helps to clarify the terms of the rule. EPA received some questions as to whether a trade secret claim must bemade at the same time the Title III submittal is submitted. Section 322requires a submitter making a claim of trade secrecy to include in thesubmittal an explanation of why the information is claimed to be a tradesecret. This clearly requires that the substantiation must be filed concurrentlywith the submittal. To facilitate accurate processing and filing of these confidential documents,submitters of claims to EPA should arrange the parts of each claim in thefollowing order: (1) The unsanitized trade secret substantiation, (2) thesanitized trade secret substantiation, (3) the unsanitized reporting document(not applicable to section 303 reports and section 311 MSDSs, as explainedbelow), and (4) the sanitized reporting document. Each substantiation andreporting document should be individually stapled but the Agency requeststhat the individual parts for each claim be assembled into a single packageusing only a binder clip or rubber band. Do not staple the individual partstogether. When facilities submit trade secrecy claims for more than one chemical,EPA requests that the three or four parts associated with each chemicalbe assembled as a set and each set for different chemicals be kept separatewithin the package sent to EPA.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Users of Trade Name Products </ITAG>Reports and claims regarding mixtures and trade name chemical productsraise a number of special issues. Public comments were received on a numberof points that EPA clarifies below. Public comments indicated some users are concerned as to their responsibilitiesin cases where they do not know the chemical identity of mixtures and tradename products. Commenters were concerned about whether they had to submita trade secrecy claim if they did not know the specific chemical identityof the product they use, even though they do not consider that the factthat they use the product is a trade secret. EPA does not require a tradesecrecy claim if the user does not consider its use of the product as atrade secret. For example, if a user does not know the specific chemicalidentity of a chemical and must provide a common name or trade name onthe Title III submittal, EPA does not require a claim of trade secrecyfor the omitted chemical identity because this identity, being unknownto the user, cannot be provided in such an instance. This issue is alsodiscussed in the section 313 final rule addressing supplier notification.See 53 FR 4500. If the submitter considers its use of the trade name chemical as a tradesecret, it may file a trade secrecy claim according to the usual proceduresset forth in this rule. The user will be allowed to file for trade secrecytreating the trade name as the chemical identity and filling out thoseparts of the Title III submittal sent to EPA that it can supply withoutknowing the specific chemical identity. The user must still file a completesubstantiation. When making trade secrecy claims for trade name products,some commenters indicated that portions of the substantiation questionswould not apply to their trade secrecy claim, however. If so, EPA requiresthat the user making a trade secrecy claim for its use of a trade namechemical must answer each question by explaining why it believes the questionto be inapplicable. EPA does <T3>not </T3>extend permission to file trade secret claims for common ortrade names to users that know the specific chemical names of the chemicalto be reported and consider that chemical use to be a trade secret. Ifusers know the chemical names of substances they use and wish to file atrade secrecy claim, they must make the claim in terms of the chemicalnames of the substances. On the other hand, downstream chemical users andchemical licensees who happen to know the chemical identity of the tradename chemical are not required to submit claims of trade secrecy basedsolely on their knowledge of the specific chemical identity since thisrequirement would entirely duplicate the trade secrecy claim of the originalchemical manufacturer and serve no purpose. In the rulemaking process, EPA considered more extensive requirements onusers making trade secrecy claims for their uses of trade name chemicals.One approach would have required suppliers to inform EPA of the chemicalidentity and complete the substantiation questions for the users who wishedto make a trade secrecy claim. Another option considered was the ``bestefforts'' approach based on the proposed section 313 rule (52 FR 21151,21155), which would have required the user to make multiple attempts toobtain the chemical identity from the supplier, including offering to enterinto a confidentiality agreement with the supplier. In some cases, it may be especially difficult for facilities to acquirefrom their suppliers the identity of chemicals claimed trade secret bytheir supplier. Users of chemicals may encounter instances where the supplierdoes not have the same interest in providing information to them or inprotecting the confidentiality of their trade secrets. Suppliers may, insome instances, sell to competitors from whom a facility wishes to keepchemical identities or applications a trade secret. EPA decided on themore pragmatic approach of allowing users of trade secret chemicals whowished to make a trade secrecy claim for their use of the trade name chemicalto file claims based on their current knowledge, rather than having torely upon obtaining cooperation from suppliers. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Licensees </ITAG>One commenter stated that the rule does not address trade secret protectionin the context of licensing arrangements that include private confidentialityagreements between suppliers and users. The commenter asserted that inthese instances, a facility that is licensed to produce or otherwise usea trade secret chemical may have information about that chemical, includingits chemical identity. At the same time, neither the chemical identitynor the use of the chemical is the trade secret of the licensee, and thelicensee may not be able to justify it as such. As a response to this circumstance,the commenter suggested that the rule provide for a blanket trade secretsubstantiation by the licensor with a letter submission by the licenseereferring back to the licensor's substantiation or explanation submission.EPA requires in the above situation that users who are licensees of tradesecret chemicals and who wish to make a trade secrecy claim for their ownuse of the chemical, file a claim of trade secrecy. If possible, thesesubmitters should obtain the information necessary to complete the substantiationform, where relevant, from the supplier with whom they signed the confidentialityagreement, to the extent such information is needed to answer the questionson the form. If, upon review of the claim EPA requests supplemental informationwhich the licensee does not have, the licensee will be required to contactthe licensor who must contact EPA directly with the necessary information.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Addresses for Claims and Petitions </ITAG>All trade secret claims and petitions requesting disclosure of identitiesclaimed as trade secret should be sent to the following address:<ITAG tagnum="15">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Emergency Planning and CommunityRight-to-Know Program, P.O. Box 70266, Washington, DC 20024-0266</ITAG>Submitters may hand deliver their submittals to: <ITAG tagnum="15">Title III Reporting Center, 470/490 L' Enfant Plaza East, SW., 7thFloor, Suite 7103, Washington, DC </ITAG>C. Claims Under Sections 303(d)(2)and 303(d)(3) Section 303 concerns the formulation of contingency plans by local emergencyplanning committees. Section 303(d)(2) states that owners or operatorsof facilities must promptly inform committees of any relevant changes occurringat the facilities as the changes occur or are expected to occur. Section303(d)(3) states that owners or operators of facilities must promptly provideinformation to committees when committees request information from facilitiesnecessary for the development and implementation of emergency plans. A trade secrecy claim under section 303(d)(2) must include a copy of thenotification of changes in the facility that was provided to the localcommittee. This notification may be in the form of a letter or other writtencommunication. The document must include the name and address of the submitter.A trade secrecy claim under section 303(d)(3) must include a copy of theinformation requested by the local emergency planning committee and theinformation provided by the facility in response to the request. A letteror other written communication containing this information is sufficient.The document must include the name and address of the submitter. In both of these submittals, where there is a need to refer to a specificchemical identity, the generic class or category of each chemical (``class''is synonymous with ``category'') claimed as trade secret should be usedinstead of the trade secret chemical identity. The generic class or categoryfor chemicals subject to section 303 reporting is discussed below in thissection. EPA is taking the burden-reducing step of not requiring submitters to preparean unsanitized version of this document for the reason that EPA will bereceiving the claimed chemical identity on the unsanitized version of thesubstantiation form. For each chemical identity claimed as trade secretin a section 303 report, a complete substantiation must be submitted toEPA. The substantiation will be discussed in greater detail in sectionII.G. below. Claims should be packaged as described in section II.B.1.of this preamble, and in instructions to the substantiation form.<ITAG tagnum="81">Generic Class or Category </ITAG>When a local emergency planning committee develops its contingency plan,identification of the specific chemicals that are present in its jurisdictionis vital to the development of the plan and is the first issue to be resolvedin the initial preparation of the plan. As stated above, if a facilitydoes not wish to reveal the specific chemical identity to the committeein the context of sections 303 (d)(2) and (d)(3), the section 303 submittalmust include in the place of chemical identity, the generic class or categoryof the chemical claimed as trade secret. The purpose of the generic classor category is to provide a description of the chemical that is not asspecific as the specific chemical identity. The generic class or categoryshould provide the best description possible of the claimed chemical, asexplained below. The purpose of a contingency plan is to provide effective, expedient emergencyresponse to aid response workers and community residents in the event ofa chemical release. In order to prepare an effective contingency plan,the hazards involved with the specific chemicals such as explosivity orflammability and the adverse health effects associated with the releasemust be known. Only by knowing this information, can proper equipment andprocedures be used to contain the release. If chemical identity is claimedas trade secret by a facility, such information can in many circumstancesstill be obtained through the determination of a generic class or categorythat reflects the information, as well as by other questions posed to thefacility by the local emergency planning committee. The proposed rule set forth for public comment three alternatives regardingthe choice of generic class or category for Title III submittals undersections 303 (d)(2) and (d)(3). The alternatives all required negotiationbecause the Agency believed it would be impossible to devise a finite listof generic classes or categories that would incorporate the wide varietyof safety factors that LEPCs and the general public may desire to know.These safety factors included chemical release hazards, adverse healtheffects information, distance of the affected community from the facility,level of sophistication of the first responder, and type of land use nearthe facility. Language in the proposed rule suggested that safety factorsshould be reflected in the generic class or category chosen. The alternatives suggested in the proposed rule were:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) LEPCs and owners or operators would negotiate a suitable classor category, with no example list offered by the Agency; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The sections 311-312 hazard categories would be provided as examplesfrom which LEPCs and owners or operators could choose a class or category,or if they believed it to be necessary, the parties could choose anotherhazard-based class or category which better reflected the safety informationdescribed above; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) LEPCs and facilities would negotiate a class based on chemicalstructure.</ITAG>The proposed rule on trade secrets did not discuss generic class or categorydeterminations for section 313 submittals; another alternative was adoptedby EPA in the final rule for section 3l3. The section 313 proposed rulestated that owners or operators should choose a generic class or categorybased on the preassigned class or category code for each chemical whichwas set out in the section 313 proposed rule. This process was changedin the section 313 final rule to allow reporting facilities to use anygeneric class or category that is structurally descriptive of the chemicalclaimed as trade secret. This change was made because of the possibilitythat trade secrecy could be compromised when the preassigned class or categorywas cross-referenced with one or more of the four adverse health effectcategories provided for the section 313 chemicals in the Toxic ReleaseInventory database. The comments received on the alternatives were divided. Some of the commenterswanted EPA to publish a finite list of classes or categories based on hazardcategories alone, and allow facilities to choose the appropriate classor categories. Some commenters wanted facilities to choose a class basedon chemical function or chemical structure without negotiation with LEPCs,State Emergency Response Commissions (SERCs), or fire departments. A fewcommenters supported the requirement of negotiation of generic class orcategory among the parties involved. EPA has reevaluated the necessity for negotiation in choosing generic classor category and has decided to follow the process chosen for the section313 final rule. Allowing owners or operators to choose classes on theirown based on chemical structure is preferable to the options set forthin the proposed rule for several reasons. First, it will be simpler forindustry, LEPCs, SERCs, and fire departments than requiring the time-consumingprocess of negotiation; second, negotiation of generic classes could alsobe technically burdensome to LEPCs; and third, this approach will providegreater consistency for choosing generic class or category under the varioussections of the law. Although owners or operators will be choosing generic classes or categorieson their own, EPA is advising that classes be chosen following the guidelinesof the Act's legislative history. The Conference Report directs that genericclass or category be defined only as broadly as necessary to protect thespecific chemical identity from disclosure, and it should at the same timereflect the thrust of the law to transmit chemical information to the public.Thus, EPA advises that classes be determined so that information on thespecific chemical identity's release hazards and adverse health effectsare included in the class or category. As an example of such a class, volatilealdehyde is a generic class that is functionally descriptive of the chemicalacid aldehyde and provides information on the chemical's volatility. D. Claims Under Section 311 As provided in the rule for sections 311-312, when reporting, a submitterof a section 311 report must submit either an MSDS for each hazardous chemical(above a threshold quantity), or a list of the hazardous chemicals withthe chemical or common name of each hazardous chemical as provided on theMSDS.<ITAG tagnum="81">Claims of Trade Secrecy for MSDSs </ITAG>Submitters must send to EPA a copy of the MSDS, and an unsanitized andsanitized substantiation. An explanation of the substantiation is set forthin section II.G. below. Claims should be packaged as described in sectionII.B.1 of this preamble, and the instructions to the substantiation form.EPA is not requiring submitters to provide an unsanitized version of theMSDS. The Agency received comments indicating that most facilities do nothave ``unsanitized'' copies (i.e., copies indicating chemical identities)of MSDSs on file under the HCS where they have claimed chemical identityas trade secret. In such cases, facilities have on file only MSDSs thatomit the chemical names of trade secret chemicals and instead contain acommon name for the chemical. For a facility to supply an ``unsanitized''MSDS_i.e., one containing the chemical identity of a chemical claimed astrade secret_to EPA under the section 322 rule, as proposed, the facilitywould have had to modify an MSDS that did not previously indicate the chemicalidentity. One suggestion by commenters was to allow facilities to attachsupplements of their own design indicating the chemical identities. EPAdecided, however, that because the information on chemical identity willbe provided to EPA in the unsanitized version of the substantiation formattached to the MSDS, a supplement or unsanitized MSDS is therefore unnecessary.Hence, EPA is taking the burden reducing step in the final rule of notrequiring an unsanitized MSDS (though the requirements for unsanitizedcopies of sections 311 lists, 312 Tier II forms, and 313 forms remain unchangedfrom the proposed rule). Three commenters stated that trade secrecy claims should not be necessaryunder section 322 in cases where a specific chemical identity has alreadybeen withheld as trade secret on an MSDS under OSHA's Hazard CommunicationStandard. Section 322(a) states that a person required to submit informationunder Title III may withhold from such submittal the specific chemicalidentity. When the specific chemical identity is claimed as trade secretunder the HCS, the identity does not appear on the MSDS that the facilitykeeps on file under that standard. The commenters argued that because theidentity is not present when these MSDSs are to be submitted under section311, the submitters are not ``withholding'' chemical identity and thusa claim of trade secrecy under section 322 should not be required. EPA disagrees with this argument for several reasons. First, if a manufacturerof a chemical were not required to file a trade secrecy claim under TitleIII because it had already treated the chemical as a trade secret underthe HCS, the detailed, upfront substantiation provisions of section 322would be circumvented. The HCS allows chemicals to be treated as tradesecrets at the discretion of facilities, provided the facility can substantiatethe secret if challenged. Congress was more strict in enacting Title IIIin this regard, requiring that the claim be substantiated at the time itis made. Further, under the commenters' view, the public would be denied the meansto petition for review of the trade secret claim because no claim wouldever have been made, and no similar option for review by the general publicexists under the HCS. Therefore, EPA requires that a claim of trade secrecymust be filed for section 311 MSDS submittals even when the chemical identityis previously withheld from the MSDS as trade secret under the OSHA HCS.Reporting of mixtures on the MSDS is discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="81">Claims of Trade Secrecy for the Section 311 List </ITAG>The list option under section 311 is structured so that submitters mayreport either the chemical or common names of a chemical on the list. Submitterswishing to claim chemical identity as trade secret must submit to EPA anunsanitized version of the list which contains the chemical identity oridentities which are being claimed. The submitter must also send a sanitizedversion of the list in which the chemical identity or identities are replacedwith generic classes or categories. When more than one chemical is claimedas a trade secret, to avoid confusion the order of chemical names foundon the unsanitized list must match the order of generic classes or categoriesfound on the sanitized list. As with all other trade secrecy claims underTitle III, submitters must also send to EPA a sanitized and unsanitizedversion of the substantiation. Claims should be packaged as described insection II.B.1 of this preamble and in the instructions to the substantiationform. Since submitters have the option of reporting chemicals on the section311 list by either chemical or common name, some submitters may believethat even with the use of the common name trade secret chemical identitywill be revealed. In this instance submitters may want to make a claimof trade secrecy for the chemical identity. However, in other instances,as commenters noted, the use of the common name may sufficiently protecttrade secret chemical identity, and the submitter may decide that no tradesecrecy claim needs to be filed. LEPCs may later request the MSDSs forthe chemicals on the list. If the submitter has made no trade secrecy claimfor the chemical on the list, (because the use of the common name sufficientlyprotected trade secret chemical identity), but the specific chemical identityis withheld from the MSDS distributed to the LEPC, then the submitter must,at that time, file a trade secrecy claim with EPA regarding that MSDS.<ITAG tagnum="81">Mixtures Reporting on the MSDS, Section 311 List, and Section 312Tier II Form </ITAG>For reporting mixtures under sections 311 and 312 (on MSDSs, lists, orTier II forms) the submitter may provide the required information on eachhazardous component in the mixture, or may provide the required informationon the mixture as a whole. If a mixture is reported as a whole by common name on the section 311 MSDS,section 311 list, or section 312 Tier II form, no trade secrecy claim needsto be filed with EPA if the submitter believes that common name sufficientlyprotects trade secrecy. However, if the common name or other identifier,e.g., CAS number, insufficiently protects trade secret chemical identitythe submitter may file a trade secrecy claim. Claims are to be made inthe manner specified for the MSDS, section 311 list or section 312 TierII form, whichever is appropriate. EPA received some comment on the question of whether trade secrecy claimsneed to be made for hazardous components of mixtures reported on the OSHAMSDS. Commenters indicated that EPA should consider instances where thespecific chemical identities of hazardous components of mixtures wouldbe claimed as trade secret on the OSHA MSDS. These commenters argued thatalthough OSHA usually requires hazardous components to be listed on anMSDS when a mixture is reported as a whole, section 311 is silent regardingwhether such hazardous components must be submitted. These commenters arguedtherefore, that no trade secrecy claim needed to be submitted to EPA forthose hazardous components listed on the OSHA MSDS. EPA believes that sinceCongress authorized the reporting of mixtures as a whole under sections311 and 312, and since health and safety data are provided for the mixtureson MSDSs, no trade secrecy claims need to be made for hazardous componentswhen a mixture is reported as a whole.Two commenters suggested that to reduce the paperwork burden on themselvesand the Agency, EPA should allow trade secret claimants of mixtures tosubmit one claim rather than several claims in the situation where thesame hazardous chemical is present in many different mixtures. This approachis permitted in section 311(a)(3) of the statute, which states that onlyone MSDS is required to be submitted for each component where the reportingis on the hazardous component(s) of the mixture, and not on the mixtureitself. <ITAG tagnum="81">Generic Class or Category </ITAG>The procedures for determining generic class or category are outlined inthe Generic Class or Category subsection of section II.C. E. Claims Under Section 312 Section 312 requires the submission of emergency and hazardous chemicalinventory forms. Information filed on the Tier I emergency and hazardouschemical inventory form will not involve claims of trade secrecy sincechemical identity is not requested on the form. Trade secrecy claims undersection 312 may involve only Tier II inventory forms where the specificchemical identity or other specific identifier is reported. Submitters are permitted to report Tier II chemicals by either chemicalor common names. In some instances, as commenters noted, the use of thecommon name may sufficiently protect trade secret chemical identity, andthe submitter may decide that no trade secrecy claim needs to be filed.However, some submitters may believe that even with the use of the commonname trade secret chemical identity will be revealed. In this instancesubmitters may want to make a claim of trade secrecy for the chemical identity.To make a trade secrecy claim on the Federal section 312 Tier II inventoryform, the submitter must check the trade secret box which appears to theright of the space for chemical identity on the form. EPA must receivean unsanitized copy of the form, which will include the trade secret chemicalidentity. EPA must also receive a sanitized version of the form which mustbe a duplicate of the original except that the chemical identity will bedeleted and in its place the generic class or category of that chemicalwill be inserted. The two copies should be attached by rubber band or binderclip (not stapled) to each other, the unsanitized form on top and the sanitizedform on the bottom. When more than one chemical is claimed as a trade secret,to avoid confusion the order of chemical names found on the unsanitizedTier II form (the top page) must match the order of generic classes orcategories found on the sanitized form. The sanitized Tier II form shouldbe sent to the requesting State emergency response commission, local emergencyplanning committee, or fire department. In addition, a sanitized and unsanitizedsubstantiation must be included for each chemical claimed as trade secret,as explained in section II.G. of this preamble. Claims should be packagedas described in section II.B.1 of this preamble and in the instructionsto the substantiation form. A few States have expressed an interest in using State-designed Tier IIinventory forms rather than the Federal inventory form. Under andSection;370.4l of the final rule for sections 311 and 312, facilities will meetsection 312 requirements if they submit the Federal form, an identicalState form, or an identical State form with supplemental questions authorizedunder State law. If a submitter wishes to make a trade secrecy claim, however,it must use the Federal form as its section 312 Tier II submittal. EPAbelieves it cannot accept State forms for this purpose because State formsmay contain additional information not required under this Federal law,some of which may be confidential, and EPA does not wish to accept extraneousconfidential materials requiring confidential handling under State law.State forms that collect confidential information under State right-to-knowlaws are covered under State confidentiality laws. Claims of confidentiality regarding the <T3>location </T3>of chemicals in facilities are not covered by Title IIItrade secret protection. The confidential location information should notbe sent to EPA, but only to the requesting entity. This information willbe kept confidential by that entity under section 312(d)(2)(F) which refersto section 324. Section 324(a) states that upon request by a facility owneror operator subject to the requirements of section 312, the State emergencyresponse commission and the appropriate local emergency planning committeemust withhold from disclosure the location of any specific chemical requiredby section 312(d)(2) to be contained in a Tier II inventory form. Thisprocess of confidential treatment of location information is separate fromthe process for treatment of trade secret information contained in therule for section 322. F. Claims Under Section 313 Trade secrecy claims under section 313 must include a copy of the toxicrelease inventory form. This form is published at 53 FR 4540. The submittermust check the box on the form indicating a trade secrecy claim and includea generic class or category. This generic class or category must be structurallydescriptive of the chemical claimed as trade secret, as described in theGeneric Class or Category subsection of section II.C. of this preamble.EPA must also receive a sanitized copy of the toxic release inventory formwhich is identical to the original except that the chemical identity willbe deleted, leaving the generic class or category. A substantiation foreach claimed chemical identity must also be submitted, as described insection II.G. below. Claims should be packaged as described in sectionII.B.l of this preamble and in the instructions to the substantiation form.G. Initial Substantiation Section 350.7 of the proposed rule required that all claims of trade secrecymust be substantiated by the claimant providing specific answers to sevenquestions set forth in the section. The answers to each of the questionsposed, or an explanation as to why that question is not applicable, wereto be provided on the substantiation form in andSection; 350.27 and to accompanythe submission. The questions posed in the rule (and the identical questionson the form) were based on the four statutory criteria in section 322(b)of Title III and are intended to elicit from a submitter all the informationnecessary to fulfill the statutory criteria. The information submitted in response to these questions is the basis forEPA's initial determination as to whether the substantiation is sufficientaccording to the statutory criteria to support a claim of trade secrecy.Consequently, the role of the initial substantiation in the trade secretprotection process as well as the specific language of individual questionsasked under andSection; 350.7(a) received considerable comment. A description of the relationship between the rule and the statutory schemeis as follows. The first decision EPA must make after receiving a petitionto disclose trade secret chemical identity or after initiating such a decisionon its own concerns the sufficiency of the trade secret claim, that is,whether, assuming all assertions made in support of the claim are true,the assertions are sufficient to support a claim of trade secrecy for thechemical identity. EPA must make this determination of sufficiency basedsolely on the information which the trade secret claimant submits in thesubstantiation included with its Title III submission. See section 322(d)(2).It is only when a submitter's claim is deemed sufficient that it is entitledto ``supplement the explanation with detailed information to support theassertions.'' See section 322(d)(3)(A). Then, EPA is to determine whetherthe ``assertions in the explanation are true and the specific chemicalidentity is a trade secret.'' See section 322(d)(3)(B). A major concern of several commenters was that the initial substantiationrequirements were too detailed and burdensome, and that they undercut thestatutory scheme noted above. Commenters argued that Congress clearly intendedto establish a two-step process for substantiation of trade secrets, asexpressed in section 322(d)(3)(A). The commenters asserted that the proposedrule blurred the distinction between the two-step trade secret substantiationprocess by requiring the ``detailed information'' initially. The commenters proposed several options to remedy their concerns. The commentersargued that claimants should be allowed to make assertions in the initialsubstantiation and that details supporting the assertion need only be suppliedwhen a third party files a petition for disclosure. One commenter arguedthe foregoing point by stating that EPA should merely accept the assertionby a submitter that competitive harm will result if an alleged trade secretis made public_no up-front substantiation should be required for that particularassertion, and only upon challenge would a substantiation be required.The commenter felt that this option would assist a company in meeting filingdeadlines because the time-consuming substantiation form would be delayedpending a challenge to the claim. EPA has carefully considered the commenter's statements. One approach thatwas considered, though not adopted, was, instead of utilizing the proposedform, listing the four statutory requirements as set forth in the statuteand requesting the submitter to verify that it believes it has met theserequirements. The Agency chose not to adopt this method because of concernsthat responses might not include the specific facts necessary for EPA toevaluate the sufficiency of a trade secret claim, as Congress requiredin the statute. The Agency has concluded that while Congress did not intend the informationcollected up-front to consist solely of conclusory statements parrotingthe four criteria of trade secrecy set forth in the statute, neither wasan overly detailed information collection intended, which could prove undulyburdensome. EPA has sought to strike a balance between these two extremes.In striking this balance, the Agency has decided to make some changes inthe rule as proposed (and discussed below), in order to lessen the amountof detail required in the up-front substantiation, so that the reportingburden is not so great. More specific additional details may still be requestedas supplemental information. The Agency has also revised andSection; 350.7(a) (Substantiating claims oftrade secrecy) and the substantiation form to state that a submitter mustassert ``where applicable'' specific facts. This change is intended toreduce uncertainty as to when detail is required and to relieve claimantsof the burden of having to certify as true speculative statements or negativeconclusions, which commenters pointed out as a problem with some of thequestions as proposed. EPA is concerned that adoption of this change mightencourage claimants to not provide specific detail in many cases wheretheir assertions require it; the change is not intended to relieve submittersof this responsibility. The comments also raised issues concerning several of the individual questionsor sub-parts to questions, proposed in andSection; 350.7(a), and these arediscussed individually below. <T3>Question 1. </T3>The question as proposed read: ``Describe the specificmeasures taken to safeguard the confidentiality of the chemical identityclaimed as trade secret.'' Two comments were received concerning the text of Question 1. These commentsstated that the question requested information not required by the Act.However, the Agency disagrees since the statute in specific terms requiresthis information. Basic to the law of trade secrets is the requirementthat the owner of a trade secret has taken steps to protect the secretfrom disclosure. Therefore, the question is a necessary and required firstinquiry in determining whether trade secret protection is warranted forthe specific chemical identity. The Agency also received comments that proposed Question l did not requestall the information specifically required by section 322(b) of the statute;that is, whether the submitter intends to continue taking measures to safeguardits trade secret information. The commenter also noted that this informationwas expected under the sufficiency criteria. (See discussion of sufficiencycriteria below under section IV.C.) The Agency agrees with the commenterthat such information is required, and has revised Question 1 accordingly.Question 1 has been revised to read as follows: ``Describe the specificmeasures you have taken to safeguard the confidentiality of the chemicalidentity claimed as trade secret, and indicate whether these measures willcontinue in the future.'' <T3>Question 2. </T3>The question as proposed read: ``Have you disclosedthis chemical identity to any person not an employee of your company orof a local, State or Federal government entity, who has not signed a confidentialityagreement requiring them to refrain from disclosing the chemical identityto others?'' Section 350.7(a)(2) and Question 2 ask whether the submitter has disclosedthe chemical identity to any person not a company or government employeewho has not signed a confidentiality agreement. The one significant commenton the question noted that the proposed regulation specifies a signed confidentialityagreement, whereas, the statutory language upon which this Question isbased requires persons claiming a trade secret to show that persons dealingwith the alleged trade secret are ``bound by a confidentiality agreement.''The form of the agreement is not specified. The commenters cited Statelaw, common law, and custom as establishing that unwritten trade secrecyagreements are enforceable.EPA agrees with the commenters that Congress did not specify that the confidentialityagreement must be a written document. Indeed, the purpose of the questionis to ascertain whether there exists a confidential relationship betweena submitter and other parties that would prevent disclosure. The thresholdtest for a confidentiality agreement is whether it is legally enforceable.Although having a written agreement, as proposed, simplifies substantiationof the fact that the information was treated as a trade secret and stepswere taken to secure its secrecy, EPA agrees that the requirement for awritten agreement is not specified by Congress and the intent of the requirementcan be met without a writing. One minor comment was received which did not require any change in therule. Several commenters cited to situations in which a trade secret isinadvertently disclosed; however, the company does not sustain an injurybecause the error is corrected before the trade secret falls into the handsof a competitor. They requested that Question 2 of the Proposed Form beexpanded to allow for explanation of inadvertent or mistaken disclosuresthat were promptly corrected or retrieved before competitors became awareof the disclosure. The Agency does not believe that any change in the form or question wasnecessary in response to this comment. The submitter must answer affirmativelyto Question 2, but then should attach an explanation. EPA will considerthe explanation in the context of all the other steps the submitter hastaken to protect the trade secret. EPA has deleted the reference to a ``writing'' in the final andSection; 350.7(a)(2)and Question 2. The final Question 2 reads: ``Have you disclosed the informationclaimed as trade secret to any other person (other than a member of a localemergency planning committee, officer or employee of the United Statesor a State or local government, or your employee) who is not bound by aconfidentiality agreement to refrain from disclosing this trade secretto others?'' This formulation of the question avoids the double negativein the proposed question about which some commenters complained. <T3>Question 3. </T3>The question as proposed read: ``List all local, State,and Federal government entities to which you have disclosed the specificchemical identity. For each, indicate whether you asserted a confidentialityclaim for the chemical identity and whether the government entity deniedthat claim.'' One commenter thought that the question did not address situations whereinformation deemed ``confidential'' is often submitted to the governmentand the claim left unchallenged, without a determination of the claim'svalidity. The commenter stated that even if the claim is not expresslydenied, it is possible that the confidentiality claim would be denied ifeventually reviewed. In this question, EPA is attempting to ascertain the submitter's effortsto protect its trade secret. The most important elements of this questionare whether chemical identity was previously claimed as trade secret andwhether the claim was ever denied. If the claim of trade secrecy was deniedand the chemical identity therefore made public, the submitter would notbe able to meet the statutory test for confidentiality. Therefore the Agencywill not revise Question 3 to include the question of whether the submissionwas reviewed under the other authority. Several commenters questioned whether an explanation should be permittedin instances where there is a qualified or partial grant of confidentialityby a government entity, or of where a prior determination does not affectthe current claim. One commenter stated that Question 3 does not considerthe potential situation of a qualified or partial grant of confidentialityby a government entity, since the question does not request an explanationin the event that a particular government entity has denied a trade secrecyclaim. The commenter asserted that there may be circumstances in whicha partial or total denial of the claim should not adversely affect theclaim being made under Title III. A second commenter observed that thefact that the specific chemical identity of a chemical has been disclosedin some context in the past should not result in forfeiture of trade secretstatus if the disclosure was not tied to the specific Title III informationthat is at issue. Another aspect to this issue is raised by a third commenter who allegedthat Question 3 does not take into consideration the trade secret statusof chemicals whose identity may have been disclosed to a government agencyunder circumstances where the confidential connection to the submittingfirm remains undisclosed. Specifically, the commenter cites to the nonconfidentialToxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) inventory where specific chemical substancesare reported without claims of confidentiality because the inventory iscompiled in such a manner as not to link a chemical with a firm. The Agency must collect information on whether the submitter has disclosedthe information claimed as trade secret to a State, local or Federal agency,including previous disclosures to EPA under Title III or other statutes,and the steps the submitter took to protect this data. In doing so, theAgency is also attempting to discover whether there has been a public disclosureof the information. Submitters who believe it necessary to explain specialcircumstances may do so. The Agency also wishes to point out that it issometimes possible to link specific chemical substances with the reportingfirm under the non-confidential TSCA inventory. The submitter must haveclaimed the information reported as confidential to assure that there isno link under the inventory. One commenter stated that if ``disclosure'' was defined too broadly itwould negate the intent of the Community Right-to-Know aspect of TitleIII. A company might be reluctant to share information with an LEPC toavoid being held to have disclosed the trade secret. However, the commenter'sdiscussion seemed to indicate that the information being provided to theLEPC would be health and safety data, not the specific chemical identitywhich constitutes the trade secret. Therefore, the situation describedby the commenter would not constitute a disclosure of the trade secret,and the Agency has decided that no revision to the final rule is necessaryto respond to this comment.<T3>Question 4. </T3>Proposed andSection; 350.7(a)(4) and Question 4 requiretrade secret claimants to substantiate the harm to their competitive positionthat would result from disclosure of the information claimed as trade secret.The proposed Question 4 provided:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) In order to show the validity of a trade secrecy claim, you mustidentify your specific use of the substance claimed as trade secret andexplain why it is a secret of interest to competitors. Therefore: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Describe the specific use of the chemical substance, identifyingthe product or process in which it is used. (If you use the substance otherthan as a component of a product or in a manufacturing process, identifythe activity where the substance is used.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Has your company or facility identity been linked to the specificchemical identity of the substance in publications or other informationavailable to the public (of which you are aware)? } Yes } No. Is this linkageknown to your competitors? } Yes } No. If the answer to either questionis yes, explain why this knowledge does not eliminate the justificationfor trade secrecy. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) If this use of the substance is unknown outside your company,explain how your competitors could deduce this use from disclosure of thechemical identity together with other information on the form. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) Explain why your use of the substance would be valuable informationto your competitors.</ITAG>Several commenters asserted that it is unreasonable for the Agency to requireclaimants to characterize their competitors' knowledge of the informationclaimed to be trade secret, as in Questions 4 (b) and (c). They arguedthat it is impossible to state what someone else knows, and that the inabilityto provide an accurate assessment of what competitors know should not endangera trade secret claim. This requirement was also claimed to be inconsistentwith the common law of trade secrecy, which does not require a trade secretclaimant to show the knowledge, motivation, or capabilities of its competitorsin order to avoid forfeiture of a trade secret. Moreover, commenters argued,a substantiation should not be determined insufficient on the basis thata competitor is aware of the claimant's use of a substance. As long asthe information confers an advantage on the firms that do know it and itis treated as a secret by each of them, the information should qualifyfor trade secret status. Finally, one commenter went so far as to suggestthat any reference to competitors' knowledge should be deleted altogether.The problem of requiring claimants to assert facts concerning the knowledgeof competitors is related to a more general complaint of commenters thatthe criteria of proposed andSection; 350.7 tended to be phrased as ``negativeconclusions,'' and thus were difficult to prove. Commenters asserted thatthese provisions would place claimants in the untenable position of beingrequired to certify the accuracy of statements that cannot be anythingmore than speculation. Commenters are correct in stating that trade secrecy claimants should notbe required to certify to the truth of speculative statements. It is alsotrue that more than one person can claim trade secrecy protection regardingthe same information. Nevertheless, one of the factors that the Agencymust consider in determining whether information is a trade secret is the<T3>extent</T3> to which the information is known outside of the claimant'sbusiness. Therefore, claimants should be required to address their competitors'knowledge if they know whether such knowledge exists. Accordingly, the Agency has revised andSection; 350.7(a)(4) and Question4 to require claimants to characterize their competitors' knowledge ofthe information claimed as trade secret, to the extent that they know whethersuch knowledge exists. One commenter also stated that the term ``substance'' is used for the firsttime in substantiation Question 4, is not defined, and therefore is ambiguous.The commenter suggested that EPA define the term or, preferably, replaceit with a term that is already among the terms used in the rule. In orderto conform Question 4 with terminology used throughout the rule, EPA hasreplaced the term ``substance'' with the phrase ``chemical claimed as tradesecret'' in the final rule. Several individual questions within Question 4 also received comment, andare discussed in order. <T3>Question 4(a). </T3>This question asks the submitter to describe thespecific use of the chemical substance, identifying the product or processin which it is used. One commenter suggested that EPA delete the term ``specific''as it relates to the use or process of the chemical being described becauseno more than a general description is necessary here. The commenter alsoasked the Agency to clarify that a facility need only provide process oruse information that is relevant to the claim being made, i.e., that theclaim of trade secrecy may not relate solely to the use of the chemical,but may relate to other factors. EPA disagrees with the commenter on the specificity of use informationthat is required. Such information is always relevant to a trade secrecyclaim. Although information regarding use may not always be sufficient,standing alone, for the Agency to determine the validity of a trade secrecyclaim, it is necessary information in the Agency's evaluation of the claimwhich should, together with other required information, enable the Agencyto make the determinations required by Title III. Accordingly, EPA hasretained the requirement for information regarding the specific use inthe final rule, but has revised andSection; 350.7(a)(4)(i) and Question 4(a)to substitute the term ``chemical'' for ``substance'' (as explained above).<T3>Question 4(b). </T3>This question asks whether the company or facilityidentity has been linked to the specific chemical identity of the substancein publications or other information available to the public and whetherthis linkage is known to competitors. The one comment received suggestedthat the subquestion, ``Is this linkage known to your competitors?'', shouldbe deleted, because the claimant cannot know the answer, making it speculative.Further, the commenter stated that even if the linkages were known by acompetitor, this would not necessarily render the trade secret invalid.As discussed above, EPA agrees that the knowledge of competitors may notbe known. EPA has amended the final rule to reflect this change. In addition,EPA added a reference to patents in this question, which are a subset ofpublications. The discussion under Question 7 describes in detail the reasonswhy the requirements of the substantiation dealing with patents can beadequately addressed in the modified Question 4(b). Therefore, in the finalrule, andSection; 350.7(a)(4)(ii) and Question 4(b) have been revised toread as follows: ``Has your company or facility identity been linked tothe specific chemical identity claimed as trade secret in a patent, orin publications or other information sources available to the public oryour competitors (of which you are aware)? If so, explain why this knowledgedoes not eliminate the justification for trade secrecy.'' <T3>Question 4(c). </T3>The question asks the submitter to explain howcompetitors could deduce a trade secret use from disclosure of the chemicalidentity together with other information on the reporting form. One commenterstated that this question should be deleted as speculative. The commenterargued that if chemical identity as related to use could be deduced fromother information on a Title III submission, there would hardly be reasonfor the claimant to incur the time and expense of submitting a trade secrecyclaim. Another commenter argued that this question and Question 4(d) (discussedbelow) appear to be more appropriate for substantiating claims of <T3>use</T3> confidentiality than <T3>chemical identity </T3>confidentiality. The commenter argued that acompetitor may be able to determine information on a generic basis sufficientto recognize the specific information it needs in order to learn the tradesecret. The commenter stated that a company should be able to protect itselffrom future competitors as well as present ones. The Agency is not persuaded by comments that Question 4(c) should be droppedfrom the substantiation that must be provided by each claimant. Regardingthe supposed distinction between use confidentiality and chemical identityconfidentiality, the two concepts are not mutually exclusive. Rather, informationon the use of a chemical is necessary to determine the validity of a tradesecrecy claim as to the identity of that chemical.The final rule, however, contains a revision of andSection; 350.7(a)(4)(iii)and Question 4(c) that substitutes ``chemical claimed as trade secret''for the term ``substance.'' <T3>Question 4(d). </T3>The question requires the submitter to explainhow his use of the substance would be valuable information to competitors.One commenter asked the Agency to clarify that submitters are not requiredto include a dollar estimate in their statement of ``value,'' particularlysince such an estimate would be speculative and, therefore, would not becertifiable as a ``specific fact.'' Another commenter suggested that thisquestion be revised to read, ``Explain why the information for which chemicalidentity is being claimed trade secret would be valuable information toother business entities.'' This commenter stated that it is not only ``competitors''but other business entities that could use trade secret information tothe detriment of the claimant. First, EPA does not intend for submitters to provide a dollar estimateas the sole measure of value in Question 4(d). Such a requirement wouldindeed put submitters in the position of certifying what could be highlyspeculative information. Reasonable dollar estimates may be worthwhilein the final determination, and may be requested as supplemental information.Second, the law of trade secrecy refers to ``competitors,'' not ``otherbusiness entities,'' as the universe of entities against whom trade secrecyprotection applies. The only change that has been made to andSection; 350.7(a)(4) and Question4(d) in the final rule has been the substitution of the term ``chemical''for the term ``substance.'' The final version of question 4 reads: ``In order to show the validityof a trade secrecy claim, you must identify your specific use of the chemicalclaimed as trade secret and explain why it is a secret of interest to competitors.Therefore: (i) Describe the specific use of the chemical claimed as trade secret,identifying the product or process in which it is used. (If you use thechemical other than as a component of a product or in a manufacturing process,identify the activity where the chemical is used.) (ii) Has your company or facility identity been linked to the specificchemical identity claimed as trade secret in a patent, or in publicationsor other information sources available to the public (of which you areaware)? If so, explain why this knowledge does not eliminate the justificationfor trade secrecy. (iii) If this use of the chemical claimed as trade secret is unknown outsideyour company, explain how your competitors could deduce this use from disclosureof the chemical identity together with other information on the Title IIIsubmittal form. (iv) Explain why your use of the chemical claimed as trade secret wouldbe valuable information to your competitors.'' <T3>Question 5. </T3>The proposed Question 5 read: ``Indicate the natureof the harm to your competitive position that would likely result fromdisclosure of the specific chemical identity, including an estimate ofthe potential loss of sales or profitability.'' Two commenters stated that an estimate of the potential loss of sales orprofitability should not be required. One of these commenters asked EPAto indicate in the Preamble to the final rule that detailed informationneed not be submitted in response to this question at the time of an initialsubmission. The commenter stated that this question would be time-consumingdue to the amount and diverse sources of marketing and other data requiredto provide an accurate estimate. A more detailed estimate of the potential loss of sales or profitabilitymay be more appropriate as part of a supplemental substantiation (at whichtime EPA assesses the factual accuracy of the submitter's assertion). Thepurposes of an initial substantiation may be fulfilled by requiring a descriptionof the nature of harm to competitive position that may result from tradesecret disclosure, and an explanation of why such harm would be substantial.EPA agrees with these commenters, and has dropped the requirement to developa loss of sales estimate as part of the initial substantiation. One commenter requested that EPA recognize that trade secrets developedby ``serendipity'' are protectable under section 322 of Title III. Thecommenter noted that although the submitter may not have gone to any greatexpense to develop the trade secret, the secret nevertheless may be ofgreat value to the submitter. This is consistent with the intent of thestatute and the sufficiency criteria described in the final rule. The costsdiscussed in the rule relate to the cost to a competitor of replicatingthe information, not to the owner of the information in developing it originally.Although information will not be protectable as trade secret if it is readilyavailable public knowledge, nothing will prevent the protection as tradesecret information which the claimant has discovered with minimal effortby a stroke of good fortune. Accordingly, EPA has revised andSection; 350.7(a)(5) and Question 5 to readas follows: ``Indicate the nature of the harm to your competitive positionthat would likely result from disclosure of the specific chemical identity,and indicate why such harm would be substantial.'' <T3>Question 6. </T3>The proposed question 6 read: ``To what extent isthe substance available to the public or your competitors in products,articles, or environmental releases? Describe the factors which influence the cost of determining the identityof the substance by chemical analysis of the product, article, or wastewhich contains the substance (e.g., whether the substance is in pure formor is mixed with other substances), and provide a rough estimate of thatcost.'' The issue of discovery of a chemical by reverse engineering arises in Question6 of the substantiation form, andSection; 350.7(a)(6), although the term``reverse engineering'' is not mentioned in the question. This sectionof the substantiation is derived from the fourth statutory criterion (thatchemical identity is not readily discoverable through reverse engineering)and the question requires answers that reflect on whether the trade secretclaimed can be reverse engineered. Most comments regarding reverse engineering focused on the difference betweenthe proposed rule's use of the term ``reasonably learn'' as opposed tothe statutory term ``readily discoverable'' as the appropriate standardof sufficiency for evaluating a chemical's susceptibility to discoveryby reverse engineering. Commenters generally objected to the proposed rule'suse of the term ``reasonably learn'', primarily on the basis that it wouldprovide less protection for trade secrets than would the statutory standard``readily discoverable.'' The statutory term was also favored because itis a generally accepted and understood term employed in analytic chemistry,while ``reasonably learn'' is not. Most commenters who addressed this issue explained that given sufficienttime and ample resources, the discovery of almost any chemical by reverseengineering would be considered ``reasonable.'' The commonly understooddefinition of the statutory standard, on the other hand, takes into accountwhether the time and resources necessary to successfully reverse engineera product are readily available. Conversely, one commenter supported adefinition that would deny trade secret protection if an identity is atall discoverable by reverse engineering. Essentially, the reasonably learn versus readily discoverable issue isa matter of terminology. The Agency's choice of the term ``reasonably learn''in the proposed rule was derived from the statute's directive in section322(c) that the regulations regarding reverse engineering be ``equivalentto comparable provisions'' in OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard, andany revisions to the HCS required by <T3>United States Steelworkers v. Auchter, </T3>763 F.2d 728 (3d Cir. 1985).The definition of trade secrecy in the HCS was determined by the <T3>Auchter </T3>court to be legally deficient with respect to determiningthe legitimacy of trade secret claims because it failed to account fora chemical's susceptibility to reverse engineering. The revised HCS accordinglyadopted the Restatement's definition of trade secret as an appendix, whichrequires consideration of the ability of others to discover the secretby legitimate means, including reverse engineering.It is apparent from these revised OSHA regulations, as well as from theRestatement's definition and applicable case law, that the generally understoodmeaning of ``readily discoverable'' by reverse engineering requires thatthe chemical identity at issue be discoverable using readily availableequipment, generally known analytic techniques, and that the required costs,time, and resources are reasonable considering the benefits derived. Thisis the standard the Agency intended by its initial choice of the ``reasonablylearn'' language. The Agency also intended, with the use of this language,to avoid denying trade secrecy claims on a purely theoretical ability toreverse engineer, since this would disregard the costs involved. The Agency has replaced the term ``reasonably learn'' with ``readily discoverable.''This standard is consistent with the revised OSHA HCS and the holding of<T3>Auchter, </T3>as directed by section 322(c). In order to avoid anyconfusion about the applicable standard, and to make it as consistent aspossible with the HCS, the Agency has also adopted the Restatement definitionof trade secret as an appendix. These changes should be recognized as changes in terms solely for the purposeof promoting clarity; it does not indicate a substantive change in thestandard. Commenters also perceived other practical and legal problems arising fromthe proposed trade secret definition with respect to reverse engineering.Section 350.7(a)(6) and Question 6 of the proposed rule requested tradesecrecy claimants to ``provide a rough estimate of [the] cost'' of determiningthe identity of the trade secret substance through reverse engineering.The development of such cost estimates was considered useful by the Agencybecause cost is a factor to consider in determining whether a trade secretis readily ascertainable by reverse engineering. Commenters neverthelesspointed out difficulties, such as that developing a preestimate of thecosts to reverse engineer would be speculative owing to the uncertaintiesof analytic chemistry, and that the costs will vary widely from companyto company for analysis of similar chemical compounds because of differencesin available resources and equipment and in the level of training and sophisticationof those conducting the analyses. Definitional problems were also raised, such as whether the cost estimateshould include costs other than those to conduct the chemical analysis(i.e., the costs to develop and replicate the product once the chemicalconstituents have been identified), and whether the estimates should includethe cost of the necessary equipment. Commenters also noted that the uncertaintyof reverse engineering costs contributes to the trade secret's protection,since unknown costs may influence a competitor's decision not to undertakesuch an analysis. The concerns regarding the possible compromise of trade secret protectionby providing an estimate of the costs to reverse engineer seem to be theresult of some confusion about the rule's requirements. If cost informationis itself confidential information that information may be claimed as suchon the trade secret substantiation. Nevertheless, trade secret law requires some indication of the cost todiscover the trade secret in order to determine the validity of the claim.If the cost of identifying the trade secret by reverse engineering exceedsthe value of the trade secret itself, the trade secret is not consideredto be readily discoverable. However, as one commenter correctly pointedout, cost is an inexact proxy for the pertinent factual determination ofwhether the trade secret is disclosable by reverse engineering. The variationin resources available to different companies also makes dollar comparisonsdifficult, thereby lessening the value of dollar-specific estimates. While it is impossible to determine the ease or difficulty of reverse engineeringwithout considering the costs and equipment involved, it is apparent thatthe requirement to develop specific dollar estimates will not appreciablyfurther the inquiry at the initial stage of substantiating a trade secretunder Title III. More useful to the analysis are the descriptions of thefactors influencing the cost of identifying the substance sufficient todisclose the trade secret through chemical analysis. Accordingly, the Agencyin the final rule has deleted the requirement to provide a ``rough costestimate'' of the costs of reverse engineering in the substantiation form,but has retained the requirement to provide a description of the factorsthat influence the costs of analysis. Claimants may still be requested to develop cost estimates as supplementalinformation following the initial review of the substantiation. The descriptionsof cost factors in the substantiation must be as specific and detailedas practicable and should include information regarding the level of expertiseneeded, the type of equipment required, the time involved, and so forth.It is in the submitter's best interest to provide a well-detailed descriptionof those factors that are indicative of cost, so that the Agency can makea realistic appraisal of this express statutory criterion. The failureto provide a sufficiently detailed description will likely jeopardize atrade secrecy claim. Section 350.7(a)(6) and Question 6 of the trade secret substantiation formrequest information regarding the trade secret chemical's availabilityin both final products and in environmental releases. Commenters objectedto the requirement to assess availability in environmental releases, citingmyriad practical problems attendant to analyzing waste streams, such asthe extent to which a waste flow may be treated prior to discharge, varyingflow rates, dilutions, unintended reactions, the presence of impurities,and similar factors. These factors are asserted to make it economicallyimpractical to conduct such a chemical analysis, and to adversely affectthe ability of presently-available technologies to detect the chemicalat all. The Agency recognizes that, as a practical matter, the likelihood of successfullyidentifying a chemical present in facility wastes is less than the likelihoodfor analysis of a finished product available on the open market. Nevertheless,the assessment of whether the chemical identity is discoverable in a wastestream or release is not significantly different from the same assessmentfor the discoverability of a chemical present in a product available tothe public or competitors. The salient question is, given the compoundor mixture under scrutiny, can it be readily reverse engineered to identifythe chemical that is claimed as trade secret. In order to address thosecases in which a release is of sufficient purity such that the chemicalis susceptible to discovery through reverse engineering, or where technologicaladvances make such analysis feasible, this factor has been retained inthe final rule. Commenters also suggested that presumptions be established against a product'ssusceptibility to reverse engineering in certain cases. However, becauseassessing whether a ``secret'' can be discovered by reverse engineeringor other investigatory method is fact-specific and often a unique inquiry,the Agency does not believe that a decisionmaking process punctuated bypresumptions in lieu of specific fact-finding is useful or appropriate.One commenter questioned whether a history of disinterest on the part ofcompetitors in the trade secret chemical should be taken into considerationin determining whether a chemical is discoverable by reverse engineering.EPA agrees that a history of disinterest in a claimant's product is relevantto a trade secret claim, as it is some indication that the secret is notgenerally known to competitors. The history of disinterest may also besome indication that the chemical is not susceptible to reverse engineering,but it cannot be considered dispositive. The final question 6 reads: ``(i) To what extent is the chemical claimedas trade secret available to the public or your competitors in products,articles, or environmental releases? (ii) Describe the factors which influencethe cost of determining the identity of the chemical whose identity isbeing claimed trade secret by chemical analysis of the product, article,or waste which contains the chemical (e.g., whether the chemical is inpure form or is mixed with other substances).'' <T3>Question 7. </T3>The proposed question 7 read: ``Is your use of thissubstance subject to any U.S. patent? If so, identify the patent and explain why (A) it does not connect youwith the substance and (B) why it does not protect you from competitiveharm. Patent Number: <T2>XXXXX</T2>. The commenters raised several issues concerning the patent question. First,they pointed out that a patent is a ``publication'' and, as such, is coveredby Question 4 in the substantiation. Next, the commenters described severalsituations in which a patent would not reveal the trade secret, for example,the specific identity of the valuable substance is buried in a large listingof substances, or the use of the identified substance is the trade secret(i.e., the linkage is the trade secret). Also, the commenters feared thata ``yes'' answer to Question 7 would disqualify the claim for trade secretprotection, even though trade secret protection and patent protection arenot identical. Merging Question 7 into Question 4(ii) satisfies many of the commenter'sconcerns. Question 4(ii) now expressly considers patents, as well as anyother publications, in the relevant context of whether the publicationof the chemical identity eliminates the submitter's claim for trade secretprotection.The second issue under Question 7 that must be addressed is why patentprotection does not adequately protect the claimant from competitive harm.Eliminating Question 7 does not leave this issue unaddressed because ofits merging into Question 4(ii) and because the Agency intends to gatheradditional detail on this issue in supplemental questions to the submitter.EPA has determined that the substance of Question 7 can be adequately addressedin Question 4(ii), on publications, and Question 5 on competitive harm.Therefore, Question 4(ii) has been amended to specifically reference patents.In the final rule, andSection; 350.7(a)(4)(ii) and Question 4(ii) read: ``Hasyour company or facility identity been linked to the specific chemicalclaimed as trade secret in a patent, or in publications or other informationsources available to the public or your competitors (of which you are aware)?If so, explain why this knowledge does not eliminate the justificationfor trade secrecy.'' Finally, commenters raised a question about the requirement in the proposedrule, in andSection; 350.5(g), that trade secrecy claims with missing substantiationsor lacking a response to each question would be rejected without noticeto the submitter, and the chemical identity would be made available tothe public. Various commenters criticized this provision as unduly harsh,and noted that various circumstances could occur, such as clerical errorsor explanations being separated from the substantiation forms which couldresult in EPA receiving an incomplete substantiation. EPA agrees and accordingly,this provision has been deleted. However, if a company's submissions indicatea disregard for the rule's requirements, EPA will consider this in evaluatingwhether a claim is frivolous. H. Substantiation Form A discussion of the comments on and changes to each of the questions onthe substantiation form is found in section II.G. above. The form itselfis designed to provide sufficient space for submitters to succinctly answereach question. The Agency is looking only for specific facts, briefly statedwithin the space permitted to indicate that the submitter has met the primafacie threshold of trade secrecy. If submitters believe it necessary tomake an attachment, they may, although such instances should be rare. Additional,more extensive facts can be gathered in the supplemental round of questions.The Agency also received several public comments on the certification statementincluded at the bottom of the form. The preamble of the proposed rule requiredthat a corporate officer sign the certification form. Several commenterssuggested this was unduly burdensome in a large corporation because theofficer would be required to handle a large number of submissions and wouldnot have personal knowledge about the information contained in each submission.A few commenters also suggested that the word ``immediately'' should bedeleted from the phrase ``based on my inquiry of those individuals immediatelyresponsible for obtaining the information'' because large corporationswould have an intermediary between the person gathering the informationand the signer of the certification. Also, the certifications for sections312 and 313 do not contain this language. EPA has added a definition of ``senior management official'' to andSection;350.1 of the rule. The certification form must now be signed by an owner,operator or a senior management official. The Agency believes this requirementbalances the commenter's concerns of burden on the corporate officer whomay not have personal knowledge of the information with the need to assurehigh level responsibility for the information on the substantiation form,in accordance with Congressional intent. The Agency accepts the commenters'reasoning concerning the word ``immediately'' in the certification andhas deleted the word in this final rule. EPA received comment requesting the deletion of the last two sentencesof the certification statement. The two-tiered substantiation process describedin section II.G. allows the submitter to supply and the Agency to requestmore factual information concerning the trade secret substantiation. EPAis not requesting that the up-front substantiation contain as much detailas was originally proposed, thus there must be additional details for someof the questions available upon request. This requirement will not be deleted.The last sentence of the certification concerns the penalty for a frivolousclaim. One commenter requested that the Agency not interpret the certificationrequirements to provide a basis for asserting individual liability againstcorporate officers. EPA will not delete this provision; however, the languagehas been modified. In most cases, the company, not the individual signer,would be liable for the civilly or administratively imposed penalty. Inaddition, knowingly providing false or misleading statements to the UnitedStates government is a criminal offense under 18 U.S.C. 1001, and languageto this effect has been added. One commenter requested clarification as to whether the owner, operatoror senior management official who signs the trade secret certificationmust be the same individual who signed the section 312 or section 313 certification.The Agency does not require the same individual to sign all the forms;the Agency wishes to encourage the most knowledgeable individuals withsufficient authority to sign each certification. This balance of knowledgeand authority for all sections of Title III may not be possible for oneindividual in a large corporation with various divisions. Finally, the Agency received one comment stating that the phrase requiringthe official to verify that the substantiation was ``true, accurate andcomplete to the best knowledge and belief'' of that official was undulyburdensome and defeated the purpose of the trade secret provisions. TheAgency believes that the language in the proposed rule is appropriate toconvey the serious nature of the certification statement and the tradesecret substantiation and has retained it in the final rule. I. Claims of Confidentiality in the Substantiation Sometimes the submitter may need to refer to the chemical identity claimedas trade secret in the substantiation for that chemical. Also, in orderto supply a complete explanation of its claim of trade secrecy, the submittermay include other trade secrets or confidential business information inthe explanation. Section 322(f) allows submitters to claim as confidential on the substantiationform any information which falls within 18 U.S.C. 1905, the federal TradeSecrets Act, which requires the federal government to protect trade secretsand confidential business information unless another federal statute authorizesdisclosure. Thus, the information which may be claimed confidential inthe substantiation includes the specific chemical identity, as well asany other trade secret or confidential business information. One commenter requested that the term ``business confidentiality,'' whichis defined in the Definitions section, be deleted wherever it appears.The commenter requests that the term ``confidential business information''be used in its place. The Agency agrees that ``confidential business information''has a common usage in the law of trade secrets. However, ``business confidentiality,''as defined in the final rule, is the same term used in the Agency's confidentialbusiness information regulations at 40 CFR Part 2. To make these claims, the submitter must clearly label what informationit considers to be trade secret or confidential. This substantiation isto be submitted to EPA, along with a sanitized substantiation, in whichthe trade secret and confidential business information is deleted. If anyof the information claimed as trade secret on the substantiation is thechemical identity of a claimed chemical, then the submitter should includethe appropriate generic class or category of that chemical on the sanitizedversion of the substantiation.No substantiation needs to be submitted for information that the submitterincludes in the substantiation and claims as trade secret or confidential.The submitter need only sign the certification included at the end of thesubstantiation form, as discussed above in section H. The claims of tradesecrecy and confidentiality for information submitted in the substantiationare not subject to the petition process described below because this processapplies only to claims of trade secrecy for the chemical identity madeunder Title III. Instead, requests for disclosure of other trade secretor confidential material must be submitted pursuant to the Freedom of InformationAct regulations under 40 CFR Part 2. The Agency received a comment requesting that the unsanitized substantiationsbe automatically classified as confidential under Executive Order 12600which sets forth designation and notification procedures for confidentialbusiness information under FOIA. The provisions of this rule are in compliancewith the Executive Order; unsanitized substantiations claimed as confidentialare treated as such until determined otherwise. J. Updating Substantiations Submitted Prior to Final Rule Several commenters suggested that, in order to achieve ``fundamental fairness,''EPA should allow companies that submitted their Title III submittals priorto the effective date of this final rule on trade secrets to update theirsubstantiations without penalty. EPA agrees with this comment. Submitters could not know exactly what informationwould be required on the substantiation form until the final rule on section322 is published. Thus, submissions filed prior to the effective date ofthis final rule will be allowed to be updated. Submitters may wish to utilizethe final rule for filing submittals immediately upon publication, priorto the effective date, and are free to do so. Commenters also requested that previous substantiations be returned tothem when they submit an updated version. This is not possible, however.The Federal Records Retention Act requires that government keep such submittalsas part of the Agency's record in order to support the Agency's activitiesand decisions. K. Cross-Referencing of Substantiations EPA has been encouraged by industry commenters to develop a reporting optionthat would allow trade secret claimants to cross-reference trade secretsubstantiations already submitted to EPA in subsequent Title III filingsinvolving the same chemical and trade secret. Because the same chemicalinvolving the same trade secret may be reported under different sectionsof Title III, and because these reports require periodic updating, claimantsargued that the trade secret substantiations for each claim would be thesame. At least three different scenarios involving cross-referencing were identifiedby the commenters: (1) Subsequent reports involving the same chemical reportedunder different sections could all reference and rely on the same tradesecret substantiation (multi-section referencing); (2) subsequent reportsinvolving the same chemical and the same section_e.g., annual section 313toxic chemical release reporting_could reference and rely on the earliersubmitted substantiation (multi-year referencing); and (3) multi-facilitycompanies could cross-reference a single substantiation when reportingfor each of their facilities at which the same chemical is present, bothfor reporting under different sections (multi-facility referencing) andin subsequent years (multi-facility, multi-year referencing). The issues raised by these comments require the Agency to strike a balancebetween a submitter's ease and convenience in making and substantiatingtrade secret claims, and the relative burdens, costs, and risks posed byaltering the trade secret substantiation requirements to accommodate thisproposed method of reporting. On the one side of the balance, EPA's analysis indicates that a submitter'sreporting burden is not reduced by cross-referencing. First, a submitter must review their prior-prepared substantiations toidentify one that is appropriate and relevant for re-use (that is, an identicalsubstantiation). Cross-referencing requires that the submitter provideEPA with information sufficient to accurately identify the prior-submittedsubstantiation. Without cross-referencing, a submitter wishing to re-usean appropriate and relevant substantiation would be expected to photocopythe form, alter the reporting section check-off box, and re-sign the certificationstatement. The time and costs associated with each of these tasks are approximatelyequal, the costs for the cross referencing method being slightly higherfor the submitter. This somewhat counter-intuitive result is traceable to the labor-intensiveprocedures for cross referencing. While cross-referencing reduces the amountof paper involved, it is a slightly more complex process that increasesthe labor costs for submitters. The result is that there is no net savingsfor submitters achievable by cross referencing on a per document basis.Second, EPA does not expect the number of trade secret substantiationsthat will be identical to be high, further reducing the potential for crossreferencing to be an effective burden-reducing reporting method. The overallnumber of trade secret claims should not be high_approximately 0.1 percentof all Title III filings are expected to include trade secret claims_andbecause of the inexact nature of trade secrets and the differences in informationrequired to be disclosed under each of the five reporting sections forwhich trade secret claims are allowed, the universe of substantiationsthat will be identical and appropriate for re-use should be small. Thereis thus a low potential for cross referencing to measurably reduce a submitter'sreporting burden. Weighing against cross referencing are a variety of costs and other factorsnot consonant with the disclosure focus of the Title III program. Trade secrets by definition run counter to the right-to-know intent ofTitle III, and just as the decision to make a trade secret claim shouldnot be taken lightly, neither should substantiations be prepared as a routinedocument. The Agency encourages claimants to closely examine the reportedinformation required in each case, and carefully assess whether and howthat information affects what the submitter believes to be a trade secret.This explanation must be included in the substantiation. Even where previouslycreated substantiations are relevant and appropriate for referencing, theclaimant should have taken the time to carefully review the substantiationto determine its applicability to another claim. EPA procedures are designedto encourage this process. Cross referencing has the potential to discourage such reviews and makesmore likely the preparation and use of ``boilerplate'' substantiationsfor routine use. A review of substantiations submitted thus far under sections311-312 indicates that many submitters are treating trade secret substantiationsin this way. This is not consistent with the clear congressional intentthat facilities subject to Title III provide EPA and the public with specificand detailed information when making a trade secret claim. Moreover, becauseof their general nature, boilerplate substantiations are more likely tobe found insufficient to support a trade secret (thereby imperiling theclaim), than is one specifically prepared to support a particular claim.Finally, the costs to the Agency to implement a cross referencing systemare not justified by the small potential for reducing a submitter's reportingburden. Cross referencing adds up to nearly 50 percent to the Agency'scosts on a per document basis, exclusive of other system design and developmentcosts and requirements. And because cross referencing increases the riskof an inadvertent disclosure of submitter's trade secret information (due,for example, to faulty identification information), additional quality-controlprocedures and security measures are required, at increased cost. On balance, weighing the lack of any savings in the time and costs requiredfor submitters to prepare a substantiation against the increased coststo the EPA and to the Title III program, cross referencing is not justifiableas a viable and effective reporting alternative. However, EPA is sensitiveto and understands the burdens imposed by the extensive reporting requirementsof Title III.One significant factor contributing to the number of duplicate reportsrequired is the number of different recipients specified by the Act. Withinthis statutory framework, EPA has investigated and will continue to investigateways to reduce the overall reporting burden without compromising the primaryobjective of Title III. Toward this end, EPA has been able to identifyand plans to implement other improvements to streamline the reporting process.One burden-reducing improvement is the deletion of the requirement forthe creation of an ``unsanitized'' MSDS when making a trade secret claimunder section 311. Since most Title III reports and trade secret claimsinvolve section 311, this should represent a significant savings. For similarreasons, EPA also deleted the requirement for unsanitized section 303 reports.In addition, EPA considered_and rejected_a requirement for claimants tosubstantiate as trade secrets the hazardous components of mixtures reportedas a whole under section 311, which would have significantly added to thereporting burdens of complying with the trade secret rule. EPA has taken steps to reduce the Title III reporting burden in other ways,such as permitting facilities to report their non-trade secret informationby magnetic media. EPA will continue to investigate ways to make compliance easier and morecost-effective both for EPA and for those subject to this law, while meetingthe mandate received from Congress. Weighing the potential benefits ofreferencing against the costs and burdens, it does not appear that crossreferencing is a viable method. However, EPA will look at the number ofopportunities for cross referencing through the summer of 1989 and if actualexperience provides contrary data, this issue will be revisited. Also,EPA will permit cross referencing of previous submissions sent to Stateson a State by State basis, as the States allow. L. Submissions to State and Local Authorities If a trade secrecy claim is made with respect to a particular submission,the sanitized Title III submittal and the accompanying sanitized substantiationmust be sent to the appropriate State or local authorities, as requiredunder section 322(a)(2)(ii) of the statute. Specifically, under section303, the submittal and accompanying sanitized substantiation should besent to LEPCs, and under sections 311-312 the MSDS or a sanitized section311 list or Tier II submittal, as appropriate, and accompanying substantiationshould be sent to the SERCs, the LEPCs and to local fire departments. Finally,a sanitized 313 submittal and substantiation must be sent to the designatedState entity. If a Title III reporting form or a substantiation containingtrade secret information is sent to a State or local authority by the submitter,under the law of trade secrets it will constitute public disclosure ofthe information, and the claim will be considered invalid. Several commenters requested that EPA delete the requirement that a sanitizedcopy of the substantiation be sent to the State authorities and the localemergency planning committees. Section 322(a)(2)(A)(ii) requires that atrade secret claimant include in its section 303 (d)(2) and (d)(3), sections311-312 and section 313 submittals an ``explanation of the reasons whysuch information is claimed trade secret.'' Finally, these sections providethat all facilities subject to the Act submit this Title III submittalto the appropriate state and local authorities. Therefore, EPA cannot deletethis requirement. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Petitions Requesting Review of Trade Secrecy Claims </ITAG>Section 322 provides for a public petition process to request the disclosureof chemical identity claimed as trade secret. This petition process isonly for requesting a review of the validity of a claim that a chemicalidentity is a trade secret. If requesters want disclosure of other itemsthat have been claimed confidential (that is, items claimed as confidentialin the substantiation, rather than the Title III reporting document), suchrequests for disclosure must be made pursuant to EPA's Freedom of InformationAct regulations under 40 CFR Part 2. The petition requesting disclosure must include the petitioner's name,address, and telephone number. The petitioner may be an individual, corporation,or other entity. It must also include the sanitized copy of the submission(e.g., the MSDS, toxic chemical release inventory reporting form) in whichthe chemical is claimed as trade secret, and the petitioner must clearlyindicate on the form which chemical identity is requested for disclosure.Copies of the section 303 (d)(2) and (d)(3) filings are available at alocation designated by the local emergency planning committee. Copies ofthe section 311 and 312 filings are available at locations designated bythe State emergency response commission and the local emergency planningcommittee. Copies of the section 313 filings are available from EPA andfrom the designated State agency. EPA is requiring that a copy of the submission claiming trade secrecy accompanypetitions for disclosure of chemical identity claimed as trade secret.The Agency believes that the requirement of a copy serves to prevent anyconfusion about what disclosure the petitioner is requesting. In the proposedrule, public comment was specifically requested on this issue. All fourof the commenters who addressed this issue agreed that a petition for thedisclosure of a chemical identity claimed as a trade secret should includea copy of the submission claiming the trade secret. One commenter requested that the trade secret submitter be informed ofthe identity of a petitioner who has petitioned for the release of a tradesecret specific chemical identity. This is not required by the statuteand the Agency has decided not to add it to the final rule. However, thepetitioner's name is publicly available under the Freedom of InformationAct. Also, the petitioner is free to contact the facility directly. EPA received several comments concerning standards for the petition process.A few commenters requested that EPA restrict the petition process in orderto discourage petitioners who are seeking information for commercial, competitiveor harassment purposes. Other commenters highlighted the importance ofplacing no limits on petitions to disclose the specific chemical identitysince no restrictions were set forth in the statute. EPA agrees that itwould be inappropriate to require petitioners to have a particular reasonfor requesting disclosure of chemical identity claimed as trade secret.The statute specifically states that ``any person may petition the Administrator''and thus the Agency will not impose restrictions. At least one commenter requested that EPA limit the number of times a tradesecret could be challenged through the petition process, to avoid the filingof multiple petitions for disclosure of the same trade secret. However,the limitations of the statute, as described above, apply to the multiplepetition situation as well, and EPA can provide no change in the finalrule. As soon as a petition is filed, EPA will begin the process of reviewingthe trade secrecy claim. The time for reviewing the claim may vary, butthe statute requires EPA to reach a decision within 9 months. The petition should be mailed to the address set forth in andSection; 350.16of the rule, and set forth in this preamble at section II.B.4.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. EPA Review of Trade Secrecy Claims </ITAG>As described in the proposed rule, section 322 defines the process by whichEPA determines whether a claimed chemical identity is entitled to tradesecrecy. First, EPA must decide whether the answers to the substantiationquestions are, if true, sufficient to support the conclusion that the chemicalidentity is a trade secret. This is the determination of sufficiency referredto in the statute and is made prior to any determination of the validityof the trade secrecy claim. The statute requires EPA to follow differentprocedures depending on whether EPA decides the answers to the substantiationquestions are sufficient or insufficient. A. Overview of the Process After receiving a petition requesting disclosure of chemical identity,EPA has 30 days to make a determination of sufficiency. If the claim meetsEPA's criteria of sufficiency (explained in IV.C), EPA will notify thesubmitter that he has 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice tosubmit supplemental material in writing, supporting the truth of the assertionsmade in the substantiation. If this additional information is not forthcoming,EPA will make its determination based only upon information previouslysubmitted in the substantiation. If the claim does not meet the criteria of sufficiency, EPA will notifythe submitter, who may either file an appeal within 30 days to EPA's Officeof General Counsel or, for good cause shown, amend the substantiation insupport of its claim. Once a claim has been determined to be sufficient, EPA must decide whetherthe claim is entitled to trade secrecy. If EPA determines that the factssupport the claim of trade secrecy, the petitioner will be notified. IfEPA determines that the facts do not support the claim of trade secrecyfor chemical identity, the submitter will be notified. The statute provides for intra-agency appeal by the submitter to appealadverse decisions and for U.S. District Court review after intra-agencyappeal. This process is explained below in more detail. B. Initial Review Proposed andSection; 350.9(d) required that when EPA receives a petitionrequesting disclosure of a trade secret, or if EPA decides to initiatea determination of the validity of a trade secrecy claim, EPA shall firstdetermine whether the chemical identity claimed as trade secret is thesubject of a prior EPA determination of trade secrecy for that chemicalidentity at that same facility. If the earlier determination held thatthe facility's trade secret claim for the chemical identity was invalid,EPA was previously authorized to release the information. Before releasingthe information, the proposed rule stated that the Agency would notifythe petitioner that the facility's claim for trade secrecy status for thechemical identity is the subject of a prior determination concerning thesame facility and that such claim was invalid. Four commenters discussed the role that prior determinations should playin determining the validity of a trade secret claim. Some commenters saidthat prior determinations denying claims of trade secrecy should not bedeterminative of future claims concerning the same chemical, and suggestedthat this could violate constitutional due process. One commenter suggestedthat, in the alternative, the section should be revised to give equal weightto prior determinations that <T3>upheld </T3>the trade secret. Two commenters stated that once a specificchemical identity has been determined to be a trade secret, that findingof validity should be determinative against subsequent challenges to thesame chemical. While the Agency is not changing the scope of the provisions dealing withprior determinations in the final rule, EPA believes that some clarificationof andSection; 350.9(d) would better explain the nature of the prior determinationand would respond to the commenter's concerns. The purpose of andSection;350.9(d) is to establish a simple procedure for releasing a chemical identitywhich has already been disclosed in a prior determination for the samechemical identity at the same facility. If the trade secret has been previouslydisclosed, Title III does not permit EPA to continue to withhold the chemicalidentity as a trade secret. Obviously, if the chemical identity has beenrevealed, the chemical identity is no longer a trade secret. Of course,the Agency's prior determination that the trade secret is invalid musthave survived any appeals before the disclosure provision will be applied.The value of this provision was to expedite release of chemical identitywhich has already been revealed, but to satisfy due process EPA will notdisclose the identity until the submitter has exhausted his challengesto the initial Agency determination upon appeal to OGC and in U.S. DistrictCourt. The final rule has been amended to clarify this point. The Agency is bound by the prior disclosure only if the chemical identityclaimed as trade secret that is the subject of the second petition is identicalto the trade secret disclosed when the prior determination held the claimto be invalid. There may be instances where the use of the chemical identityclaimed as trade secret that is subject to the prior petition (and Agencydetermination) is different from the trade secret use that is the subjectof the second petition. The information on different Title III submittalscould represent different uses, one that did not qualify for trade secretprotection under Title III and one that does. In short, EPA agrees withcommenters to the extent that andSection; 350.9(d) in the final rule willnot automatically disclose a chemical identity until the Agency has determinedthat the identical trade secret has been held invalid in a prior determination.The Agency will not be bound by a prior decision upholding trade secretprotection in this rule. Trade secrets can be lost over time and the burdenis on the claimant to prove that the chemical identity meets the statutorycriteria upon receipt of a petition for disclosure. However, the Agency'sprior determination of validity will be considered in later determinations.Two commenters asked that a trade secret claimant be given adequate noticebefore a chemical identity is released. One of these commenters statedthat if a prior determination was made that a facility's chemical identitywas not a trade secret, EPA should delay 30 days before releasing the informationin order for the claimant to seek judicial review. EPA has provided noticeof intent to release chemical identity in various sections of the proposedrule where the Agency has determined that the chemical identity claimedas trade secret is not entitled to protection. The case of disclosure ofchemical identity where a prior determination has been made is not significantlydifferent from those other cases where the rule provides for notice andthe opportunity to appeal to U.S. District Court before release of theclaimed trade secret. As a result, andSection; 350.9(d) of the final rulewill be referenced to an amended andSection; 350.18(c) which contains detailedrequirements for notice of intent to release chemical identity determinednot to be trade secret. C. Determination of Sufficiency A person withholding specific chemical identity from a submission underTitle III must make specific factual assertions that are sufficient tosupport a conclusion that the chemical identity is a trade secret. Theseassertions are made by completely answering all of the questions listedin andSection; 350.7 of the rule (and found also on the Trade Secrets Substantiationform), where EPA has listed the questions that must be answered to fullyaddress the four requirements set forth in section 322(b) of the statute.To assist submitters in answering the questions, EPA indicates in andSection;350.13 of the rule the criteria that it regards as the legal basis forevaluating whether answers provided by submitters are sufficient to supportthe trade secrecy of a chemical. Submitters may wish to examine these criteriain preparing their answers to the questions contained on the form. EPA received several comments discussing the proposed sufficiency criteria.Some comments suggested that the Agency reduce the detail of the sufficiencycriteria, so that the sufficiency criteria are not overinclusive of thestatutory criteria and, in turn, the questions on the proposed form. Thesuggestions leaned toward making the sufficiency criteria identical tothe proposed questions. Other comments suggested altering the proposedquestions so that they identically reflect the sufficiency criteria. Thisway a claimant can directly address the criteria that EPA is seeking inorder to establish a prima facie case of trade secrecy. Finally, othercomments suggested that EPA review the proposed substantiation form tomatch the trade secrecy factors in section 322(b). This would substitutefor the proposed sufficiency criteria altogether.EPA determined that the sufficiency criteria, as proposed, are a valuableaid in evaluating the sufficiency of trade secret claims. While the substantiationform elicits specific facts, the criteria stated at andSection; 350.13 arethe legal standard used to determine whether the submitter has establisheda prima facie case for trade secrecy. The facts from the form are consideredagainst the sufficiency criteria to make that determination. The commenters' suggestions would alter the purpose of the criteria andundermine the ability of the Agency to determine whether or not submittershave made a prima facie case for trade secrecy under the initial reviewprocess. EPA did make changes in the sufficiency criteria to reflect changesmade in the substantiation questions. Submitters are encouraged to use the sufficiency criteria as a guide informulating their answers to the substantiation questions. Both the questionsand the criteria reflect the trade secrecy provisions of section 322(b)of Title III. Under the first criterion, the facts must show that reasonable safeguardshave been taken against unauthorized disclosure of the specific identity,that the specific chemical identity has not been disclosed to any personnot bound by a confidentiality agreement including local, State or Federalgovernment entities, and that any safeguards will be continued in the future.Under the second criterion, the submitter must show that the chemical identityclaimed as trade secret is not required to be released: (1) Under a determinationby a State or Federal agency that the chemical identity in question isnot a trade secret, or (2) under a State or Federal law which does notallow the chemical identity to be claimed as trade secret. This criterionwas also discussed in section II.A. of this preamble under emission andeffluent data. Under the third criterion, as proposed, to show that disclosure of theinformation is likely to cause substantial competitive harm, the factsmust show that either competitors do not know that the substance can beused in the fashion used by the submitter and that duplication of the specificuse cannot be determined by competitors' own research activities or thatcompetitors are unaware that the submitter is using the substance in thismanner. Some of the comments on substantiation Question 4 also raised similar concernswith this criterion. The final sufficiency requirement has been amendedwhere appropriate to reflect the Agency's determination that a submittercannot be required to certify another's state of knowledge, yet must adequatelysupport his claim of trade secrecy. The revised andSection; 350.13(a)(3)reads as follows, in the final rule:<ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Either: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) competitors do not know <T3>or the submitter is not aware that competitors know </T3>that the <T3>chemical whose identity is being claimed trade secret </T3>can be usedin the fashion that the submitter uses it, and competitors cannot easilyduplicate the specific use of this chemical through their own researchand development activities; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) competitors are not aware <T3>or the submitter does not know whether competitors are aware </T3>thatthe submitter is using <T3>this chemical </T3>in this fashion. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) The fact that the submitter manufactures, imports or otherwiseuses <T3>this chemical </T3>in a particular fashion is not contained in anypublication or other information source (<T3>of which the submitter is aware</T3>) available to competitors or thepublic. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(Emphasis added to show changes in final rule.)</ITAG>Several commenters, following the lead of the Chemical Manufacturers Associationand the American Petroleum Institute, requested that EPA revise the finalrule to recognize that just because one (or even several) competitors ina field of many know that a substance is being used in a particular fashion,this does not prevent the use from constituting a trade secret. EPA agreeswith the commenters. The law of trade secrets does not require that theowner of the information be the only one aware of the information for itto be of value. The language of the rule refers to the knowledge of ``competitors,''and this is open-ended enough to encompass a claim asserted in a factualsituation where some competitors are aware of a secret of which othersare unaware. Therefore, EPA recognizes the validity of the commenters'arguments but has not changed the language of the final rule to reflectthis. Trade secrecy claimants may file substantiations based on a factualsituation such as the one described above. Finally, the fourth criterion requires that a trade secret claimant showthat the chemical identity claimed trade secret cannot be readily discoveredby reverse engineering of the submitter's products or environmental releases.This requires the claimant to show that the chemical is not available tothe public or competitors in the claimant's products or environmental releases.The claimant must show that the chemical identity is only discoverableusing equipment that is not readily or generally available, that discoveryrequires the use of uncommon or exotic analytic techniques, and that thetime, costs, and resources required for discovery exceed the benefits providedby the trade secret chemical. The more difficult, costly, and time-consumingthe analysis required to discover the identity, the more likely the chemicalidentity will qualify for trade secret protection. If the substantiation does contain sufficient answers, EPA will notifythe submitter by certified mail. Under the statute, a finding of sufficiencyautomatically entitles the submitter to submit supplemental informationto support the truth of the answers contained in the substantiation. Thiscould include any information or documents which would demonstrate theveracity of the submitter's substantiation, or provide even greater detailin support of the submitter's claim. Based on comments on the proposedrule, EPA narrowed the level of detail required in the initial substantiationand thus increased the importance of the material provided in this secondstage. This was done in order to decrease the initial burden without sacrificingthe amount of information that would be used to determine the veracityof a claim of trade secrecy. Upon receiving EPA's request for supplemental information, the submitterwill have 30 calendar days to submit the information. If EPA does not receivethe supplemental information within this time, it will make a trade secretdetermination based upon the information already submitted. One commenterinquired as to when the 30 days provided to submit additional informationto EPA tolls. Specifically, must the information be received by EPA within30 days or will the Agency adopt a ``mailbox rule'', as suggested by thecommenter? The Agency has decided to adopt the ``mailbox rule,'' and willconsider the submission to be timely filed if postmarked within 30 daysby certified mail with the U.S. Postal Service. D. Determination of Insufficiency If EPA concludes that a substantiation does not contain answers sufficientto support the four requirements of section 322(b), then EPA will findthat the trade secret claim is insufficient. The submitter will be notifiedby certified mail of EPA's finding of insufficiency. The submitter mayeither appeal EPA's finding to EPA's Office of General Counsel or may amendits original substantiation if it demonstrates good cause to do so. Good cause was limited in the proposed rule to the following: (1) The submitter was not aware of the facts underlying the additionalinformation at the time the original substantiation was submitted, andcould not reasonably have known the facts at that time; or (2) Neither EPA regulations nor other EPA guidance called for such informationat the time the substantiation was submitted.The Small Business Administration commented, prior to the publication ofthe proposed rule, that the good cause standard should include the circumstancewhere the submitter mistakenly does not provide information but otherwiseacts in good faith to comply with the rule, and that such a provision wasmentioned in the Conference Report. Various commenters agreed with the Small Business Administration and criticizedthis provision as unduly harsh. These commenters noted that various circumstancescould occur, such as clerical errors or explanations being separated fromthe substantiation forms, that would result in EPA receiving an incompletesubstantiation. EPA has evaluated these comments and largely agrees with the commenters.The Agency has included inadvertent omissions as one of the good causeexceptions in the final rule. It is still incumbent on submitters to ensurethat claims are complete and properly packaged. Submitters should not betempted to rely on this good cause exception to routinely cure defectivesubmissions.One commenter interpreted the ``neither-nor'' language in the second exceptionas indicating that the Agency would be giving guidance, which is publishedwithout notice and comment, the same weight as regulations. The commenteralso noted that the Conference Report used the conjunctive ``and.'' TheAgency intended to adopt the same meaning as that included in the ConferenceReport. Accordingly this language has been changed in the final rule. EPA has revised the good cause exceptions to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">``(A) The submitter was not aware of the facts underlying the additionalinformation at the time the substantiation was submitted, and could notreasonably have known the facts at that time; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) EPA regulations and other EPA guidance did not call for such informationat the time the substantiation was submitted; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) The submitter had made a good faith effort to submit a completesubstantiation, but failed to do so due to an inadvertent omission or clericalerror.''</ITAG>The submitter must notify EPA by letter of its contentions as to good causeand should include in that letter the additional supporting material. EPAwill notify the submitter by certified mail if the good cause standardhas not been met and the additional supporting material will not be accepted.The submitter may then seek review in U.S. District Court. If after acceptanceof additional supporting material for good cause, EPA decides the claimis still insufficient, the submitter will be notified by certified mailand may seek review in U.S. District Court. If EPA reverses itself on appeal or after accepting additional assertionsfor good cause, and decides that the trade secret claim is sufficient,then the claim will be processed as though it had been initially foundto be sufficient. If upon appeal, EPA makes a final determination thatthe original answers in the substantiation were insufficient, the submittermay request review in U.S. District Court within 30 days of notice of thefinal determination. E. Determination of Trade Secrecy All claims determined to be sufficient either initially, after appeal,or after acceptance of additional material for good cause, will be examinedin order to determine whether a valid claim of trade secrecy is presented.In making a determination of trade secrecy, EPA will examine the factualinformation provided in the substantiation form in light of the four factorsunder section 322(b). If EPA decides that the chemical identity is a trade secret, the petitionershall be notified by certified mail and may seek review in U.S. DistrictCourt. If EPA decides that the chemical identity is not a trade secret,the submitter shall be notified by certified mail and may appeal this determinationto EPA's Office of General Counsel within 30 days. If EPA does not reverseits decision on appeal, the submitter may seek review in U.S. DistrictCourt within 30 days of notice of the final determination. F. Appeals Section 350.17 of the proposed rule established procedures for appeal froman EPA determination that a claim presented insufficient support for afinding of trade secrecy under andSection; 350.11(a)(2)(i), or an EPA findingthat a specific chemical identity is not a trade secret under andSection;350.11(b)(2)(i). The proposal provided procedures for filing an appealto EPA's Office of General Counsel (OGC), a description of the appeal processin OGC, and procedures for further appeal to Federal court if OGC upholdsthe Agency's rejection of the claim for trade secret protection. The proposedrule did not specify the standard that OGC will apply in considering asubmitter's appeal, nor did it provide for a hearing. These two featuresas well as other details of the appeal process received comment. Two commenters requested that EPA amend andSection; 350.17 to provide theright to a hearing on appeal to OGC. One of these commenters specifiedthat the hearing should be provided upon request of the trade secret claimant.One commenter asked that the regulation be revised to establish a standardunder which review by OGC on appeal will be conducted. The same commenterfurther stated that, because a reviewing court will consider the Agencyopinion on a de novo basis, OGC should use a de novo standard in reviewingthe program office's decisions on appeal. Four commenters stated that andSection; 350.17 should be revised to requireOGC to state the basis for its decision on appeal. Another of these commentersrecommended the use of procedures paralleling those referred to in andSection;350.11(b), which are applicable to EPA's initial decision on a trade secrecyclaim and require EPA to provide a claimant with the reasons for EPA'sdecision. One commenter requested that the rule be revised to permit a submitterof a trade secret claim to appeal to OGC if his claim is judged to be insufficient,even after he has submitted additional material upon a showing of goodcause. EPA's provisions on appeals in andSection; 350.17 closely follow the schemefor appeals under Title III. Title III did not provide the submitter withan opportunity for a hearing as part of the administrative appeal processand EPA will not include such a provision. Title III also did not specify a standard of review for the administrativeappeal process. In its review, the Office of General Counsel will be examiningthe entire record of the determination and statement of reasons. This reviewwill encompass the complete file. Submitters who are denied trade secretprotection have full access to U.S. District Court. The Agency agrees with commenters that sound administrative proceduresdictate that the submitter be provided with a statement of the reasonsfor OGC's decision to uphold or reverse the program office's decision onappeal. The final rule has been amended to include a requirement for astatement of reasons to accompany the OGC decisions upon appeal. Finally, EPA has not changed the final rule to allow an appeal to OGC whena submitter whose trade secrecy claim has been found to be insufficienthas chosen to submit additional material in support of its claim (for goodcause shown). This provision tracks statutory language that permits thetrade secret claimant to either amend the claim in order to meet the sufficiencyrequirements <T3>or </T3>to appeal the finding of insufficiency to OGC. If the claimantopts to amend the claim, the statute requires that the right to appealthe Agency's initial finding is forfeited. However, the submitter who losesthe right to an OGC appeal still has the right to appeal the Agency's adversedetermination to U.S. District Court.<ITAG tagnum="81">Judicial Appeal </ITAG>Section 350.18(c) of the proposed rule established procedures to be usedby EPA when submitters are slow to appeal Agency decisions to U.S. DistrictCourt or fail to prosecute the appeal in a timely fashion. One provisionof the proposed section received considerable comment. That provision authorizedthe Agency to disclose the identity of the trade secret, ``once the courthas denied a motion for a preliminary injunction in the action or has otherwiseupheld the EPA determination, or whenever it appears to the Office of GeneralCounsel, after reasonable notice to the business, that the business isnot taking appropriate measures to obtain a speedy resolution of the action.''In urging deletion of the provision, the commenters made several arguments.First, the commenters noted that, once the submitter's appeal is underthe court's jurisdiction, there are existing mechanisms to insure a speedyresolution of the case at issue. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allowthe government to request a status conference to press action (Rule 11)or to move for dismissal of the appeal for failure to prosecute if thereis an undue delay (Rule 41). Next, a few commenters maintained that thegovernment's action to speed up the appeal would destroy the trade secretunilaterally during the pendency of action challenging the government'sright to make that destruction. The commenters believe this action wasunfair and undercut the court's jurisdiction. Moreover, since a trade secretis an intangible property right guaranteed by Constitutional protections,government destruction of that property during the course of the appealcould constitute a violation of submitter's due process rights. EPA has decided not to delete the provision in question in the final rule.The provision is identical to language in EPA's Confidential Business Informationregulations at 40 CFR 2.205(f)(2), and thus makes Title III regulationsconsistent with similar EPA procedures. The language of proposed andSection;350.18(c) and final andSection; 350.18(d) states that EPA <T3>may </T3>disclose the trade secret, that is, use of the provision isnot mandatory. Also, this disclosure may take place only after reasonablenotice to the business. Accordingly, EPA has finalized this section asproposed, except for changing the reference to the party appealing thedenial from ``business'' (used in 40 CFR Part 2) to ``submitters'' (usedin Title III). G. Common Errors Found on Substantiations The Agency examined a sample of substantiations received since the proposedrule was issued and discovered a number of errors that occurred frequentlyenough that the Agency wishes to alert submitters to the need to carefullyprepare their substantiations to avoid these, and other, errors. Commonerrors found by the Agency fall into the following categories: (i) Problems associated with not using the EPA substantiation form; (ii) Certification of the substantiation; (iii) Contents of responses to questions in the form; and (iv) Packaging of the claim. In order for EPA to work together with claimants to adequately protecttheir trade secrets, EPA strongly advises claimants to submit claims accordingto the following guidelines. Failure to do so could result in the claimbeing found insufficient and/or frivolous. Submitters found making frivolousclaims are subject to a penalty not to exceed $25,000 per claim. As statedin the preamble, EPA plans to evaluate claims and vigorously prosecutethose found to be frivolous. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Problems Associated With Not Using the EPA Substantiation Form</ITAG>The first area of errors concerned non-use of the substantiation form asprovided in the rule. Several claimants devised their own substantiationform, or did not use any form at all. In almost every case where a submitter-devisedform was used, the forms were inaccurately reproduced. This invariablyled to inappropriate and inapplicable responses (many submitters had alteredthe wording of substantiation questions), and, especially where no formwas used, entire areas of information required to be reported were omitted.Almost every submitter-devised substantiation form did not sufficientlyidentify the reporting facility. Also, many submitter-devised substantiationsneglected to report the specific chemical identity, and all but one formthat was reviewed for errors omitted the certification statement in itsentirety. EPA is required to collect the information requested by the form. Incompletesubstantiations will in all likelihood be found insufficient to supportthe claim, and the claim will be denied. Moreover, the statute providesthat a submitter who fails to provide information in the initial substantiationwill be subject to a $10,000 penalty. Substantiations that do not sufficientlyidentify the chemical or reporting facility increase the likelihood ofa finding that the facility is not in compliance. Several claimants who used the Agency form failed to fill out the formin its entirety, or neglected to submit all the pages of the form. Althoughmissing pages would ordinarily be expected to indicate a mere clericalerror, at least one submitter omitted the same page in each filing forthe facility, suggesting a systematic disregard for the rule's requirements.Again, the probable consequence of an incomplete substantiation is a $10,000penalty, and the increased possibility that the claim will be denied. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Certification of the Substantiation </ITAG>The next area of error concerns the substantiation form's certification.Common errors included the certification's inaccurate reproduction or omissionin its entirety from submitter-devised forms, unsigned certifications,and photocopied signatures. The certification statement may not be varied by submitters. It containsspecific assurances regarding the quality of the information and statementsregarding the submitter's obligations under Title III. Noncompliance withthis specific certification requirement may jeopardize the trade secretclaim. An original signature is required for each trade secret substantiationsubmitted to EPA, both sanitized and unsanitized. An original signatureindicates that the submitter is in fact certifying that the particularsubstantiation provided to EPA is complete, true, and accurate, and thatit is intended to support the particular trade secret claim being made.In light of the heavy penalties for noncompliance, this requirement protectsboth the Agency and the submitter. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Contents of Responses to Substantiation Questions </ITAG>The first common error in this area is the setting forth of conclusorystatements rather than descriptive factual assertions. The proposed rulespecifically stated that more than a conclusory statement of compliancemust be made in the substantiation because EPA is required under section322(d) to make a determination of sufficiency based upon the informationprovided by the submitter in the substantiation. To determine sufficiencyEPA must decide, assuming that the assertions in the substantiation aretrue, whether the assertions are sufficient to support a claim of tradesecrecy. Descriptive factual statements are necessary for this purpose.Conclusory statements of compliance do not provide enough information forEPA to make this determination. Substantiations containing only conclusorystatements are therefore insufficient to support the claim. In addition, mere conclusory statements are insufficient since EPA is requiredto evaluate whether the factual assertions are true based on supplementalinformation that a claimant may be required to submit following the initialreview. The second common problem in this area concerns what information may beclaimed trade secret under Title III. EPA has received claims both forentire products (and not the chemical(s) that is (are) the trade secret),and for chemicals that are not reportable under Title III. Only the specificchemical identity required to be disclosed in sections 303, 311, 312, and313 submissions may be claimed as trade secret. No other information maybe withheld as a trade secret from publicly available Title III reports.The final problem in this area is that location information claimed asconfidential under section 312(d)(2)(F) should not be sent to EPA; thisinformation should only be sent to the SERC, LEPC, and the fire department.EPA has received several claims accompanied by blueprints of facilities.It is neither necessary nor appropriate to send such information to theAgency. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Packaging of the Claim</ITAG>The fourth problem area involved packaging of claims. The items requiredfor a complete filing have been varied from the proposed rule, so submittersare advised to pay close attention to what is needed. In order for a claimto be complete under section 322, the submitter must include in the submittalthe following items: for section 303 reports and reporting by MSDS undersection 311, a complete package will include 3 items: The public 303 reportor 311 MSDS, and sanitized and unsanitized substantiation. Reports undersection 31l using the list approach, 312 Tier II reports, and 313 toxirelease inventory reports will include 4 items: Sanitized and unsanitized311, 312, or 313 reports, plus a sanitized and unsanitized substantiationfor <T3>each </T3>chemical claimed trade secret. Because multiple chemicals may be reported (and claimed trade secret) usingthe 311 list method and under 312 Tier II, it is of paramount importancethat claimants (1) include in the unsanitized submittals the specific chemicalidentity being claimed trade secret, and (2) not separate the 311 or 312filing from the accompanying substantiations. In some cases, submitters provided separately each of the four parts ofa trade secret submittal. The Agency must receive a complete package; otherwise,it is difficult to determine whether a claim is complete and what chemical(s)is (are) being claimed trade secret. If it is not clear that a chemicalidentity is being claimed trade secret, EPA will not know that it shouldnot make the information available to the public. For the submitter's ownprotection, securing together all three or four parts of a claim will makeit clear that a claim is complete when submitted. These guidelines and requirements are designed for the submitter's andthe Agency's protection. If they are not followed, it will be much morelikely that the Agency will conclude, based solely on the information providedby a submitter, that a claim is frivolous or incomplete. It also makesmore likely that the Agency will disclose information that the submitterintended to claim trade secret because it was not clear that a claim wasbeing made. At the same time, following these guidelines permits EPA tomake appropriate determinations of trade secrecy, and to legally make publicthose portions of each submittal required to be disclosed. In this wayEPA can work to preserve the confidentiality of legitimate trade secrets,and fulfill the Congressional mandate to make non-trade secret informationpublic. H. Enforcement Section 325(d) authorizes the Administrator to assess a civil penalty of$25,000 per claim against a trade secret claimant if the Administratordetermines that a trade secret claim is frivolous. Two commenters askedfor an explanation of the term ``frivolous claims.'' One of these commentersasked for policy guidance and recommended that a good faith test be employed.A third commenter expressed support for the Agency position on frivolousclaims, and requested that the Agency determine the validity of each tradesecrecy claim without waiting for petitions for disclosure of the information.A frivolous claim is one without a factual or legal basis or one wherethe facts and circumstances relied upon to substantiate a trade secrecyclaim are without merit. Section 325(c) authorizes the assessment of acivil penalty of $10,000 per violation for any person who fails to furnisha substantiation. These penalties can be assessed by either administrativeorder or through the appropriate U.S. District Court. The proposed rule contained a provision indicating that submitters of tradesecret claims who failed to submit supplemental information requested byEPA may be liable for a fine of up to $10,000 per violation under section325(c). When EPA reviewed the statute, it was found that this provisionhad been inadvertently included in the proposed rule, but was not containedin the Act. The final rule, therefore, contains no such provision. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Relationship of Section 322 to Other Statutes </ITAG>A. Relationship to State Confidentiality Statutes As stated in the proposed rule, section 321 of Title III provides thatnothing in Title III ``shall preempt any State or local law.'' This meansthat the confidentiality requirements of Title III are not to displaceState confidentiality requirements under State Right-To-Know Acts. A Statecan still prescribe the type of information it will classify as confidentialwhen it gathers information for its own use under a State law, such asa Right-To-Know Act. However, state confidentiality statutes do not governinformation gathered under Federal law, here Title III. State confidentialitystatutes only apply to information collected pursuant to State law forState use. When information is gathered under Title III, the Federal confidentialityrequirements of section 322 apply regardless of whether the informationis sent to a State or Federal agency because the information is being gatheredpursuant to a Federal statute. One commenter requested that the ``other'' information in the Title IIItrade secret substantiation that is protected under the Freedom of InformationAct be covered instead under more protective State law. The commenter arguesthat this is justified because the information is being sent to State andlocal entities. As stated above, the destination of the data is irrelevantbecause it is being gathered pursuant to a Federal statute and thus theonly protection allowed is Federally based.State confidentiality statutes may affect Title III information if Statetrade secrecy law or regulations prohibit claims of trade secrecy underState law for information that a submitter must also report under TitleIII. Under the substantiation provisions of Title III, a facility willnot be able to justify withholding the information under Title III. Onecommenter stated that a State law may require submission of data and providegreater public access to the data than would be allowed under Title IIIprotection of trade secrets. In such cases, the data may not be eligiblefor trade secret treatment under section 322. B. Overlap with Other EPA-Administered Statutes Information collected pursuant to EPA regulations under statutes otherthan Title III may be similar to that collected under Title III. For purposesof confidentiality, information should be claimed as confidential and willbe treated by EPA as is required by the statute under which it is collected.However, the mandatory release of information under one statute may affectits trade secret status under another statute. C. Relationship to Freedom of Information Act The procedures set out in section 322 apply only to claims of trade secrecyfor chemical identity made under Title III. Pursuant to section 322(f),however, submitters may claim as trade secret any other confidential businessor trade secret information which is included in the substantiation, orsupplemental information submitted in the petition process. Requests fordisclosure of this material must be submitted under the Freedom of InformationAct regulations at 40 CFR Part 2. EPA will make determinations regardingthe disclosure of this material under those regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Release of Trade Secret Information </ITAG>A. Releases to States Under section 322(h) of the Act, the States, either the governors or theState emergency response commissions, must provide to any requesting personthe adverse health effects associated with extremely hazardous substances(section 303) and hazardous chemicals (sections 3l1 and 312) claimed astrade secret. The States will not have direct access to the identitiesof chemicals claimed as trade secret in preparing adverse health effectsdescriptions. However, the States have information on health effects inthe MSDSs submitted under section 311 for this purpose. The MSDS is requiredto include such information for any substance claimed as trade secret.Thus, governors or State commissions should not be hindered in meetingtheir responsibilities to provide descriptions of adverse health effectsand the trade secret status of the chemicals will not be endangered. Under section 322(g) of the Act, the Administrator shall provide to theState governor, upon request, any information EPA has obtained under subsection(a)(2), which includes specific chemical identities and substantiationsfor trade secrecy claims, and under subsection (d)(3), which includes thefindings that assertions made in the above substantiation materials aresufficient. Thus, if a State governor wished to request the chemical identitiesof any or all chemicals claimed as trade secret in any State, EPA willprovide this information to the State governor, upon request. However,governors are prevented by section 325(d)(2) from ``knowingly and willfully''disclosing trade secret information to the public, as are all other individuals.EPA considered the advantages and disadvantages of allowing State governorsto provide access to trade secret information to SERCs and LEPCs. Publiccomments also proposed several alternative ways of restricting disclosureof trade secret information released to States. While providing selected members of SERCs and LEPCs access to chemicalidentities may provide some benefits to State and local preparedness andplanning, it was determined that these potential advantages were outweighedby the possible consequences of unintended disclosure of bona fide tradesecrets. Because SERCs often include representatives from industry andthe public and LEPCs must include these representatives from industry andthe public, it could be very difficult to protect trade secrets from widerdisclosure than is intended. EPA determined that the decision of whetherState governors may provide trade secret information to any members ofSERCs and LEPCs shall be left up to the discretion of the governors themselves.However, EPA has included a provision in the rule which prohibits Stategovernors from releasing trade secret information to non-State employees.One commenter requested that trade secret information be given to a Stateonly after the State has demonstrated its ability to safeguard trade secretinformation. The Agency requires in the rule that States take the sameprecautions to safeguard this information as EPA itself does. The Agencybelieves that this approach is appropriate to adequately protect tradesecret information. The Agency considered the option of allowing State governors to appointdesignees to be provided with the authority to request trade secret chemicalidentities from EPA. This could expedite requests by the State departmentsof public health for information needed to conduct medical research onthe health effects of airborne toxics. However, such an expansion of thelist of authorized State representatives beyond governors alone might alsoincrease the likelihood of unintended disclosure of bona fide trade secrets.The Agency concluded that it does not have the authority to determine whoState governors may authorize to obtain trade secret information from EPA.Consequently, the EPA determined that only State governors are authorizedto request and receive trade secret information directly from EPA, as statedin the statute. B. Releases to Authorized Representatives of EPA In addition to contractors and subcontractors, EPA has recently begun touse grantee personnel to perform Agency functions. Public comments raisedtwo points. First, it was suggested that the employees of grantees be requiredto sign confidentiality agreements (as is required of the employees ofcontractors and subcontractors). Second, grantees were described as presentinga greater risk of disclosure of trade secrets (because they are typicallyretired engineers or other technical people having close associations withformer employers) and should be placed under greater restrictions thancontractors or subcontractors in general. Greater restrictions were suggestedto include either requirements for signing written conflict-of-intereststatements or requirements that grantees must demonstrate a greater needfor trade secret information. The Agency believes it is appropriate to designate grantees as ``authorizedrepresentatives,'' to be treated in the same manner as Federal contractorsand subcontractors, as that term is used in this regulation. This includesrequiring full confidentiality protection, the same procedures that contractorsmust follow, and similarly employees of grantees will be required to signconfidentiality agreements. One commenter objected to proposed andSection; 350.23, which makes contractorsauthorized representatives of EPA for the purposes of the release of tradesecret information. This provision is mandated by the Act, however, andthe Agency cannot alter or delete it. Another commenter requested thatthe Agency add a provision to the final rule to make contractors who receivetrade secret information on behalf of EPA aware of potential conflictsof interest. The Agency has decided not to do so because contractors arealready required to provide the Agency with such assurances as part ofthe contractual process. One commenter stated that EPA should comply with Export AdministrationAct (EAA) restrictions on the export of technical data through foreignnationals. The commenter suggested that through the petition process, andin particular through releases to health professionals, technical datacould be exported. The commenter also questioned whether there exist suitableprecautions to prevent the export of technical data through EPA's contractors,subcontractors, and grantees to the EPA. Especially of concern would bethe disclosure of confidential business information to a citizen of a CategoryS or Z country, which are listed in the Export Administration regulations.EPA has determined that the intent of these regulations is consistent withthose implementing the Export Administration Act. The definition of ``technicaldata'' found in the EAA regulations reads in part as follows: ``Technicaldata means information of any kind that can be used, or adapted for use,in the design, production, manufacture, utilization, or reconstructionof articles or materials.'' In section II.A. of the preamble to these regulations,the definition of trade secret protection of specific chemical identitywas said to allow for trade secrecy claims to be made to protect the linkagebetween a specific chemical identity and its ``use, production, storage,or processing.'' While these definitions are similar, it is noteworthythat these regulations are designed to protect the described informationfrom release except under very narrow, clearly defined, and controlledcircumstances. It is not EPA's intention for a foreign national to obtain trade secretinformation and export the information. The intent of the statute is ``communityright to know.'' EPA has every intention of doing everything in its powerto assure that the information collected is used to inform and protectlocal residents from chemical hazards present in their communities. Disclosureswhich lead to the export of that information out of the United States runcounter to that intent.The statute does not require, and EPA has declined to establish a requirementin these regulations, that petitioners for information claimed as tradesecret declare the reasons for their request. It would go beyond the contentof the statute for EPA to require them to state that they are citizensof the United States. When the request of a petitioner for release of informationclaimed to be trade secret is granted, the Agency has determined that theinformation is not, in fact, a trade secret.As to the export of technical data through contractors, subcontractors,and grantees to the EPA, these authorized representatives of EPA are requiredto sign confidentiality agreements and to provide full confidentialityprotection.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Disclosure to Health Professionals</ITAG>Section 323 of Title III consists of three provisions regarding accessto chemical identity information by health professionals. These provisionsrequire the facility owner or operator to disclose the chemical identity,including trade secret chemical identity, to a health professional fordiagnosis or treatment in both non-emergency and emergency situations,and for purposes of conducting preventive research studies and providingmedical treatment by a health professional who is a local government employee.The health professional must sign a statement regarding his need for thechemical identity, and a confidentiality agreement, prior to disclosure,except in emergency situations, when these two documents may be deliveredlater.One commenter requested that EPA delete entirely the requirement to providespecific chemical identity to health professionals. The commenter indicatedthat, in its experience, health professionals were more concerned withobtaining detailed health and safety data than the specific chemical identity.However, the commenter overlooks the fact that the provision of the specificchemical identity, under specified circumstances, is a direct requirementof section 323 of Title III. EPA cannot alter the basic requirements ofthe statute.Health professionals may obtain trade secret information for the threepurposes set out in the statute. However, they are required to sign a confidentialityagreement and a statement of need stating that they need the informationfor the purposes set out in the statute.A. Non-emergency Diagnosis or TreatmentThe first provision, part (a) of section 323, requires that in non-emergencysituations, an owner or operator of a facility which is subject to therequirements of sections 311, 312, or 313, shall provide the specific chemicalidentity, if known, of a hazardous chemical, extremely hazardous substance,or a toxic chemical to a health professional who requests the identityin writing and describes in a written statement of need described belowa reasonable basis for suspecting that the specific chemical identity isneeded for diagnosis or treatment of an individual or individuals who havebeen exposed to the chemical concerned. The health professional must alsostate that knowledge of the specific chemical identity will assist in diagnosisor treatment of the exposed individual(s). The health professional mustcertify that the information contained in the statement of need is trueand accurate. The health professional must also provide a signed confidentialityagreement described in VII.E to the facility prior to gaining access totrade secret chemical identity. Any health professional performing diagnosisor treatment, not solely doctors or nurses, is permitted access to tradesecret chemical identity in a non-emergency situation.B. Emergency SituationsThe second provision of section 323 deals with medical emergencies andrequires an owner or operator of a facility subject to the requirementsof sections 311, 312, or 313 to immediately provide a copy of an MSDS,an inventory form, or a toxic chemical release form, including the specificchemical identity, if known, of a hazardous chemical, extremely hazardoussubstance, or a toxic chemical, to any treating physician or nurse whorequests the chemical identity under emergency conditions as specifiedin the statute. The treating physicians or nurses must determine that:(1) a medical emergency exists; (2) the specific identity of the chemicalconcerned is necessary for or will assist in emergency or first-aid diagnosisor treatment; and (3) the individual or individuals being diagnosed ortreated have been exposed to the chemical concerned.In response to public comments, EPA considered whether health professionalsother than treating physicians and nurses (such as commercial spill contractors,paramedics, and other emergency medical services workers) should be providedaccess to trade secret chemical identities under this provision. The Agencydecided that only treating physicians and nurses are entitled to such access,in accordance with the specific wording of the statute and following theintent of the OSHA provisions. In a medical emergency, only the doctoror nurse will conduct the medical examination and diagnose the necessarytreatment. Most necessary information could be obtained from MSDSs andother Title III forms. Consequently, it is not necessary for personnelother than doctors and nurses to have access to trade secret information.The requesting physician or nurse in such an emergency does not need tosubmit a written confidentiality agreement or statement of need prior toreceiving the trade secret chemical identity. The owner or operator disclosingsuch information may, however, require a written confidentiality agreementand statement of need as soon as circumstances permit.Some industry commenters on the proposed rule expressed concern that althoughthey would be willing to provide information in the case of a true emergency,that the procedures therein would not provide adequate protection againstfraudulent attempts to obtain confidential information. EPA consideredrequiring procedures such as phone calls or the development of a systemof identification numbers. These procedures, however, would be burdensome,beyond the scope of the statute and of limited efficiency for the variousscenarios possible in emergency situations. For these reasons, EPA decidednot to recommend a specific verification procedure. If the facility wishesto verify that the situation is an emergency, the facility must do so withoutcompromising the need to immediately provide the information requestedby treating physicians and nurses. Chemical identities absolutely may notbe disclosed or used for any purpose other than the proper treatment anddiagnosis of a chemically related injury or illness.C. Preventive and Treatment MeasuresThe third provision of section 323 deals with preventive and treatmentmeasures by local health professionals. This subsection is intended toallow local health professionals access to information on chemicals inorder to facilitate epidemiological and toxicological research and to rendermedical treatment for the effects of chemical exposures. This subsectionrequires an owner or operator of a facility to promptly provide the specificchemical identity, if known, of a hazardous chemical, an extremely hazardoussubstance, or a toxic chemical to any health professional who is a localgovernment employee or under contract with a local government who submitsa request in writing and provides a written statement of need and a confidentialityagreement. The statement of need must describe one or more of the needsset forth in the regulations.Under this section of the statute, EPA interprets the term ``health professional''to be any health professional with the professional expertise to performthe types of research and treatment set forth in the statute, and who isemployed by the local government. Under this section, such health professionalsas physicians, toxicologists and epidemiologists may gain access to tradesecret chemical identity.A few industry commenters argued that a provision should be made for allowingdisclosure of relevant health effects information other than the chemicalidentity in this preventive and treatment measures section. They assertedthat other information will be sufficient to conduct the listed types ofstudies and surveillance. EPA considers it inappropriate to place regulatorylimitations on the six statutory situations in which health professionalsmay seek disclosure of chemical identities because they are explicitlymentioned in the statute.D. Statement of Need In the proposed rule, EPA requested comment concerning whether the statementof need should contain a detailed description of why the disclosure ofthe following information would not be sufficient to enable the healthprofessional to provide medical services: (a) The properties and effectsof the chemical, (b) measures for controlling the public's exposure tothe chemical, (c) methods of monitoring and analyzing the public's exposureto the chemical, and (d) methods of diagnosing and treating harmful exposureto the chemical. These are the provisions in the Occupational Safety andHealth Act Hazard Communication Standard. One commenter objected stronglyto the inclusion of these provisions, citing the paramount interest inallowing health professionals to ``undertake their own independent courseof treatment, and hopefully to prevent future disease.'' Industry commenters,on the other hand, asserted that, in the vast majority of cases, informationnecessary for diagnosis and treatment can be provided without disclosingspecific chemical identity. They argued for a presumption against disclosure,which would justify a higher standard for the health professional to meetin demonstrating that trade secret information should be disclosed.The Agency has decided not to explicitly include the OSHA provisions inthe final rule. The statutory requirement that a health professional describe``a reasonable basis'' why the specific chemical identity is needed willimplicitly explain why other information would not be sufficient. The Agencybelieves the OSHA provisions would be unnecessary. E. Confidentiality AgreementThe confidentiality agreement required of the health professional muststate that the health professional will not use the trade secret chemicalidentity for any purpose other than the health needs asserted in the statementof need, or as may otherwise be authorized by the terms of the agreementitself. This agreement may be negotiated between the health professionaland the facility. The provisions in the confidentiality agreement will enable the healthprofessional to clearly understand the extent of disclosures permissible.At a minimum, the written confidentiality agreement shall include a descriptionof the procedures to be used to maintain the confidentiality of the disclosedinformation and a statement by the health professional that he will notuse the information for any purpose other than the health needs assertedin the statement of need. Also, the health professional must agree notto release the information under any circumstances, except as authorizedby the terms of the agreement. However, this authorized disclosure maybe structured so that the health professional may release the trade secretchemical identity to other health professionals if the professionals routinelyrely on each other's expertise for needed advice. The agreement may alsospecify that the first health professional may disclose the trade secretchemical identity to other health professionals if such disclosure is necessaryin order for the first professional to learn necessary information to rendera professional opinion. Except in those instances specified in the confidentialityagreement, the health professional may not be permitted to release theinformation to other health professionals. The health professional maybe permitted to write articles for medical journals or to go on speakingtours discussing the chemical involved if such activity does not resultin the disclosure of the identity of the chemical and the facility's relationshipto that chemical. The proposed rule included a reasonable pre-estimate of damages as an appropriatelegal remedy in the event of a breach of the confidentiality agreement.Commenters expressed concern that inclusion of pre-estimates of damagesin confidentiality agreements may have a chilling effect on health professionals,discouraging them from entering into such agreements. Many health professionalsmay be unable or unwilling to assume the liability associated with sucha provision in exchange for obtaining information necessary for them toprovide proper treatment or diagnosis. Several commenters characterizedthis liability as ``unreasonable'' and ``not contemplated by the legislation.''EPA agrees with the commenters and the provision for a pre-estimate ofdamages has been deleted from the final rule. The Agency believes thatthe underlying purpose of the confidentiality agreement is to protect afacility's trade secret chemical identity from unlimited and unbridleddisclosure, not to make it overly burdensome or difficult for the healthprofessional to obtain the specific identity of a chemical. This confidentiality agreement is subject to State law and State contractualremedies. Also, nothing in this regulation precludes the facility or healthprofessional from pursuing non-contractual remedies to the extent permittedby law. F. Related Issues Following the receipt of a written request, the facility owner or operatorto whom such request is made shall promptly provide the requested informationto the health professional. EPA considered specifically defining ``promptly''and ``immediately'' to mean a particular number of days. Two commentersdiscussed the Agency's failure to define the term ``immediately'' in thecontext of the requirement to release chemical identification informationto health professionals. One of these commenters asked that the Agencydefine the term, while the other commenter expressed support for the Agency'sdecision to not specify a particular time period to provide the information.For the reasons stated above, the Agency will refrain from defining ``immediately''more specifically. The Agency did not receive any comments on this issueand has decided not to define the terms because of the concern that definedtimes will limit the speed of response. The statute requires ``immediate''provision of data in the case of medical emergencies and EPA interpretsthis to mean that the owner or operator will provide the data over thetelephone, without requiring a written statement of need or a confidentialityagreement in advance.As stated in the proposed rule, the Agency is aware of the possible situationwhere the owner or operator of a facility is unable to provide the chemicalidentity because the manufacturer of the chemical has kept the identityconfidential. In these situations, EPA suggests that the owner or operatorof the facility put the requester in touch with the supplier of the chemical,but the facility is not responsible for supplying information which itcannot obtain for itself. EPA received a comment that if a patient becomes aware, or wishes to learn,the chemical identity of a substance he was exposed to, he should be requiredto sign a confidentiality agreement. Since the provisions of section 323deal only with the release of information to health professionals, theAgency cannot require disclosures to patients as part of this rulemaking.The regulation authorizes health professionals to refer to trade secretchemical identity in discussions with EPA personnel, who themselves areauthorized to have access to Title III trade secret information. This isbased on a provision of the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard. Severalcommenters suggested that the Title III regulations should restrict therelease of confidential information from health professionals to EPA toa greater extent than was provided in the proposed rule. Specifically,several commenters stated that Title III trade secret regulations shouldmirror the procedures in the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, whichrequires that the government provide notice to the facility owner or operatorwhenever a health professional transmits trade secret information to thegovernment agency. Based on the comments, EPA considered three optionsfor restricting releases of trade secret information from health professionalsto the Agency. First, EPA considered the addition of a requirement similarto OSHA's that notice be given to the facility owner or operator whenevera health professional provides trade secret information to EPA. The secondoption considered was the limitation of communications between EPA andthe health professional to the generic class or category, in non-emergencysituations. The third option considered was to establish procedures similarto Confidential Business Information (CBI) Procedures utilized under TSCA.In this option, the health professional would be required to verify thatan EPA employee is on a CBI authorized access list before disclosing tradesecret chemical identities. EPA evaluated the options and decided that each one would impede timelytransmission of important health effects data necessary for proper diagnosisand treatment. The procedures would be administratively cumbersome andthey are not explicitly required by the statute. The Agency is alreadyfully aware of the necessity to protect trade secret information and believesadditional procedures are unnecessary. EPA construes section 323 to mean that a facility is not permitted to denydisclosure of a specific chemical identity to a health professional underany circumstances provided there is a written statement of need and a writtenconfidentiality agreement. Section 325(c) empowers EPA to assess civilpenalties of up to $10,000 for failure to disclose the trade secret chemicalidentity to health professionals in emergency situations, as required bysection 323(b). Health professionals may also sue under section 325(e)in U.S. District Court to obtain the information. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Summary of Supporting Analyses </ITAG>A. Regulatory Impact Analysis<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Purpose </ITAG>Executive Order (E.O.) No. 12291 requires each federal agency to determineif a regulation is a ``major'' rule as defined by the Order and to preparea Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) in connection with each major rule.EPA has determined that the requirements and procedures established inthis rulemaking for treatment of chemical data considered to be trade secretby facilities reporting under other sections of Title III do not constitutea major rule under E.O. No. 12291. The Agency has prepared an economicanalysis to assess the economic impacts of the final regulation on affectedindustry and government entities. The following summary of results arepresented in detail in <T3>Regulatory Impact Analysis in Support of Final Rulemaking under Sections322-323 of the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act of l986. </T3><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Methodology </ITAG>EPA conducted an assessment of the costs and benefits associated with thisfinal rule and the primary provisions of sections 322 and 323, includingthe preparation of trade secrecy claims by facilities; the processing andstoring of claims by EPA; the public petition and review process; the provisionof adverse health effects data for chemicals whose identities are withheldas trade secrets; and special access procedures under which facilitiesmust promptly provide chemical data to members of the health profession.This analysis considered the costs that five groups will incur as a resultof the rule and the section 322-323 provisions. These five groups are:facilities, EPA, public petitioners, States, and health professionals.The economic analysis conducted for the final rule took into account publiccomments on the proposed rule and modifications made to other Title IIIreporting provisions. Among the changes incorporated into the economicanalysis supporting the final rule are the trade secret claims made bynon-manufacturing facilities submitting reports under sections 311 and312 of SARA; increased costs for the public petition and review process;and consideration of the potential for cost savings per claim that mayresult when facilities file trade secret claims for the same chemical underdifferent Title III reporting sections. The economic analysis for the final rule confirms that facilities willmake trade secret claims in about 0.1 percent of the reports submittedunder Title III. This confirmation is based on the low number of tradesecret claims having actually been made by facilities in 1987 during thefirst round of reporting under section 311 of SARA. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Results </ITAG>The economic analysis conducted for the final rule estimated the coststhat would be incurred by each of the five groups affected by the ruleand the statutory provisions. The aggregate present value costs duringthe first 10 years of Title III reporting, using a discount rate of 4 percent,are estimated to be approximately $67.6 million, or an average of $6.8million annually. The following discussion summarizes the costs that eachof the major groups is estimated to incur. <T3>Facilities. </T3>Industrial facilities incur the largest amount ofcosts in preparing and filing trade secret claims. They also will incurcosts when they respond to public petitions challenging their trade secretclaims and when they provide trade secret information to health professionals.Facilities will incur the greatest costs in 1990, when the section 311MSDS reporting threshold for non-manufacturing facilities is assumed todecline from l0,000 pounds to 500 pounds. The 1990 facility costs are estimatedin the analysis to be approximately $26.4 million. The analysis also estimates the costs of an individual facility filinga trade secret claim for the first time and the costs to file subsequenttrade secret claims. An average facility will incur costs of approximately$1,100 when it files its first trade secret claim, and between $270 and$563 when it files a subsequent claim, depending on the type of claim made.If the public challenges a trade secret claim that a facility makes, theanalysis estimates that a facility will incur an average of about $1,300dollars to provide supplemental information to support the original substantiation.The analysis also estimates that these costs could range as high as $3,400if a facility's claim is rejected by EPA and the facility appeals the decisionto EPA's Office of General Counsel. Finally, the analysis estimates thatfacilities will incur costs under the provisions of section 323 that rangefrom $110 to $250 in responding to each request made by a health professionalfor information about trade secret chemicals.The time burden that this rule places upon facilities having trade secretsis estimated to consist of: 10.4 hours for a facility to become familiarwith the provisions of the rule and screen its chemicals to determine whichare trade secrets, 22.8 hours to prepare a claim (including 21.3 hoursto complete the substantiation form) for the first chemical submitted asa trade secret, and 17.7 hours to prepare additional claims for other chemicals(including 16.2 hours per chemical to complete the substantiation form).In cases where a facility submits claims for the same chemical involvingreports made under different sections of Title III, the additional relatedclaims require less effort because the facility will be able to utilizesome or all of the information prepared for the first claim (generallyassociated with the chemical's MSDS filing). The time needed for each suchrelated claim is estimated to range from 1.7 to 14.6 hours. <T3>EPA. </T3>The economic analysis estimates the aggregate ten-year presentvalue cost that EPA will incur under the three sections of the rule tobe approximately $2.6 million, or an average of $260,000 annually. Thesecosts result from EPA processing and storing trade secret claims, respondingto public petitions challenging trade secret claims, and providing adversehealth effects information on section 313 chemicals to states and the public.The processing and storing of trade secret claims and responding to publicpetitions result in EPA incurring the largest costs. The analysis estimatesthat EPA will incur costs of approximately nine dollars to process andstore each trade secret claim, in addition to annual costs of approximately$60,000 to maintain a record storage and tracking system. The Agency alsowill incur average costs of approximately $1,900 when the public filesa petition to challenge a trade secret claim. The analysis estimates thatthese costs could range from $1,450 to $5,040, depending on the circumstancesof the claim and the decision made about the validity of the petition.<T3>Petitioners. </T3>Public petitioners are estimated to incur total presentvalue costs of about $48,000 over the ten year period analyzed in the report.Each public petition filed is estimated to cost the public petitioner approximately$75, and the public is assumed to file an average of 72 petitions annuallyduring the first ten years of Title III reporting. The analysis estimatesthat the public will file the largest number of petitions in 1990, correspondingto the year in which facilities file the largest number of claims. Thetotal estimated costs incurred by the public in 1990 are approximately$20,000. <T3>States. </T3>The economic analysis conducted for the final rule estimatesthat the present value of costs incurred by the states will be about $443,000during the first ten years of Title III reporting, or approximately $44,000annually ($880 annually per state). These costs will be incurred in thecourse of requesting information from EPA on trade secret chemicals anddisseminating adverse health effects information to the public. The analysisestimates that each state will incur costs of $33 to request from EPA adversehealth effects information on section 313 chemicals; the state will incurcosts of about $56 to respond to each request from the public for adversehealth information on section 302-304 and 311-312 chemicals that facilitiesclaim trade secret. States also will incur costs to compile adverse health effects informationon chemicals reported under Title III in preparation for public requests,and to sanitize the profiles in order not to divulge trade secret information.This is estimated to cost states approximately $85,300 in 1988, when theywill develop most of the chemical profiles, and approximately $4,200 ineach subsequent year to develop profiles for new chemicals that facilitiesclaim trade secret. <T3>Health Professionals. </T3>The analysis estimates that the aggregatepresent value costs to health professionals will be approximately $372,000during the first ten years of Title III reporting, or approximately $37,200annually. The analysis also estimates that health professionals will incura range of costs between $110 and $140 in making a request of a facilityfor a trade secret, depending on the particular circumstances of the requestas described under section 323 of the rule. <T3>Sensitivity Analyses.</T3> After calculating aggregate costs for eachof the five groups, eight sensitivity analyses were conducted to test theeffect of important assumptions on the total costs of the rule. These analysesincluded the number of trade secret claims that facilities will file, thecosts of filing a trade secret claim, the likely effect of linkage on thenumber of trade secret claims, the number of Tier II claims under section312, the number of petitions that the public files challenging facilitytrade secret claims, the number of requests for adverse health effectsinformation, and the number of requests health professionals make for theidentity of trade secret chemicals. The sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the costs of the final ruleare most sensitive to the number of trade secret claims that facilitieswill file and the costs of filing each claim. <T3>Benefits. </T3>Benefits may arise as a result of this rule both forfacilities and for the public. Relationships among the activities undertakenby various affected groups are complex and only a qualitative discussionof benefits is included in the economic analysis. For facilities, directbenefits may include protection of trade secrets involving chemicals usedin production processes, that, by definition, involve information thatpermit a facility to have a competitive advantage over another facility.For the public, the rule provides a petition and review process that allowschallenge of the validity of a trade secret claim through an administrativereview process, and allows health effects information to be disclosed withoutjeopardizing the competitive position of the facility. B. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Purpose </ITAG>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis must be performed for all rule that are likely to have a ``significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities'' (small businesses, smallorganizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). The analysis containedin this economic analysis addresses the impact of this rule on small entities.Based on this analysis, EPA has concluded that although a large numberof small businesses reporting under Title III could be affected by thisrule, the costs of the rule generally will be low on a per facility basisand that significant impacts will not result. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Methodology and Results </ITAG>In order to assess the likely economic impacts that this final rule willhave on small businesses, EPA compared likely average costs for small facilitiesto file a trade secret claim with median sales for those facilities, andevaluated whether the rule likely would affect a substantial number ofsmall entities. The results of the economic analysis show generally that the cost of filinga trade secret claim will not be a burden on facilities because the likelycosts of filing a trade secret claim under a worst-case scenario testedin the analysis are less than one percent of median sales. EPA defined small businesses in this analysis to be those with fewer than20 employees. The number of small businesses under this definition is estimatedto be approximately 2,794,400 facilities (the universe of facilities incategories covered by section 303, the broadest of the sections associatedwith trade secrecy claims). The economic analysis conducted for the finalrule estimates that approximately 61,600 facilities will file trade secretclaims during the first ten years of Title III reporting. If all facilitiesfiling trade secret claims met the definition of ``small business,'' thiswould encompass only 2.2 percent of small businesses, well below the usuallevel of 20 percent established by EPA to represent a ``substantial'' numberof small facilities.<ITAG tagnum="81"> 3. Certification </ITAG>On the basis of the analyses contained in the economic analysis with respectto the impact of this rule on small entities, I hereby certify that thisrule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of smallentities. This rule, therefore, does not require a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis. C. Paperwork Reduction Act Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto vary from 27.7 to 33.2 hours per response, with an average of 28.8 hoursper response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existingdata sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding theburden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information PolicyBranch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW.,Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

At the time a report is submitted, the submitter must present a completeset of assertions that (if true) would be sufficient to justify the claimof trade secrecy; and2. If the claim is reviewed by EPA, the submitter will be asked to provideadditional factual information sufficient to establish the truthfulnessof the assertions made at the time the claim was made.In making its assertions of trade secrecy, a submitter should provide,where applicable, descriptive factual statements.

Definition of trade secret. A trade secret may consist of any formula,pattern, device or compilation of information which is used in one's business,and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitorswho do not know or use it. It may be a formula for a chemical compound,a process of manufacturing, treating or preserving materials, a patternfor a machine or other device, or a list of customers. It differs fromother secret information in a business (see section 759) in that it isnot simply information as to single or ephemeral events in the conductof the business, as, for example, the amount or other terms of a secretbid for a contract or the salary of certain employees, or the securityinvestments made or contemplated, or the date fixed for the announcementof a new policy or for bringing out a new model or the like. A trade secretis a process or device for continuous use in the operation of the business.Generally it relates to the production of goods, as, for example, a machineor formula for the production of an article. It may, however, relate tothe sale of goods or to other operations in the business, such as a codefor determining discounts, rebates or other concessions in a price listor catalogue, or a list of specialized customers, or a method of bookkeepingor other office management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Secrecy. The subject matter of a trade secret must be secret. Mattersof public knowledge or of general knowledge in an industry cannot be appropriatedby one as his secret. Matters which are completely disclosed by the goodswhich one markets cannot be his secret. Substantially, a trade secret isknown only in the particular business in which it is used. It is not requisitethat only the proprietor of the business know it. He may, without losinghis protection, communicate it to employees involved in its use. He maylikewise communicate it to others pledged to secrecy. Others may also knowof it independently, as, for example, when they have discovered the processor formula by independent invention and are keeping it secret. Nevertheless,a substantial element of secrecy must exist, so that, except by the useof improper means, there would be difficulty in acquiring the information.An exact definition of a trade secret is not possible. Some factors tobe considered in determining whether given information is one's trade secretare: (1) The extent to which the information is known outside of his business;(2) the extent to which it is known by employees and others involved inhis business; (3) the extent of measures taken by him to guard the secrecyof the information; (4) the value of the information to him and to hiscompetitors; (5) the amount of effort or money expended by him in developingthe information; (6) the ease or difficulty with which the informationcould be properly acquired or duplicated by others.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Novelty and prior art. A trade secret may be a device or process whichis patentable; but it need not be that. It may be a device or process whichis clearly anticipated in the prior art or one which is merely a mechanicalimprovement that a good mechanic can make. Novelty and invention are notrequisite for a trade secret as they are for patentability. These requirementsare essential to patentability because a patent protects against unlicenseduse of the patented device or process even by one who discovers it properlythrough independent research. The patent monopoly is a reward to the inventor.But such is not the case with a trade secret. Its protection is not basedon a policy of rewarding or otherwise encouraging the development of secretprocesses or devices. The protection is merely against breach of faithand reprehensible means of learning another's secret. For this limitedprotection it is not appropriate to require also the kind of novelty andinvention which is a requisite of patentability. The nature of the secretis, however, an important factor in determining the kind of relief thatis appropriate against one who is subject to liability under the rule statedin this section. Thus, if the secret consists of a device or process whichis a novel invention, one who acquires the secret wrongfully is ordinarilyenjoined from further use of it and is required to account for the profitsderived from his past use. If, on the other hand, the secret consists ofmechanical improvements that a good mechanic can make without resort tothe secret, the wrongdoer's liability may be limited to damages, and aninjunction against future use of the improvements made with the aid ofthe secret may be inappropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">Subpart B_Disclosure of Trade Secret Information to Health Professionals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 350.40 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Disclosure to health professionals. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Definitions. </T3>``Medical emergency'' means any unforeseen conditionwhich a health professional would judge to require urgent and unscheduledmedical attention.
