PerryStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   &quot;Are there any entertainers running for president?&quot; a new survey asks.    &quot;Yes,&quot; say 14% of the sample, and 4% identify Paul Simon, the singer, as that entertainer-candidate. The real Paul Simon running for president is a senator from Illinois who wears bow ties and doesn't sing at all and is still doing very well in Iowa.    Moving from one momentous question to another, the survey asks its 800 random respondents across the country who &quot;committed the worst sins -- Gary Hart, Ted Kennedy, Joe Biden or Richard Nixon?&quot; The answer is perfectly clear -- Mr. Nixon, at 51%. Sen. Kennedy is second, at 23%, followed by former Sen. Hart, 10%, and Sen. Biden, 3%.    &quot;Whose sins were second worst?&quot; Mr. Hart wins that one, edging out Sen. Kennedy, 26% to 21%.    Is anyone disappointed that Mr. Hart, Gov. Mario Cuomo, Sens. Biden, Bill Bradley and Sam Nunn, Rep. Pat Schroeder and developer Donald Trump aren't running for president? Yes, 25% say they miss Mr. Hart; 18% say they miss Mr. Cuomo. Hardly anyone misses the others.    The offbeat survey was taken by telephone by the firm of Penn andamp; Schoen Associates for Spy, a New York-based monthly magazine modeled loosely on Private Eye, the highly successful British satirical bimonthly.    The survey results were announced at a jammed four-TV-camera news conference at the National Press Club here.    &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; Thomas L. Phillips Jr., Spy's publisher, was asked. &quot;Crass material goals,&quot; he replied.    Helping to sponsor the survey was Paddington Corp., importers and marketers of Jandamp;B Scotch whisky.    There are more hard-hitting questions in the poll.    In the Reagan mode, the survey asks, which of these acting figures -- John Forsythe, Jane Fonda, Paul Newman, Charlton Heston, Bill Cosby, Mary Tyler Moore or Johnny Carson -- could best make the transition to politics? Mr. Heston wins easily, with 22%, followed by Mr. Newman, 16%; Mr. Cosby, 15%; Ms. Fonda, 9%; Mr. Carson, 6%; and Ms. Moore, 1%.    Who's the &quot;craziest&quot; candidate in the race?    Tough one. The preachers finished one-two, with the Rev. Jesse Jackson in first, at 12%, and the Rev. Pat Robertson second, at 11%. Gen. Alexander Haig came in a respectable third, at 6%. But 54% of the respondents say they don't know.    Who's the &quot;funniest&quot; candidate?    Another tough one, with some evidence the respondents aren't sure what kind of &quot;funniest&quot; the pollsters had in mind. It was the preachers one-two again, with Mr. Robertson first this time and Mr. Jackson second. Sen. Bob Dole, who really is supposed to be funny, finished two points behind George Bush.    Seriously, who's ahead?    Mr. Jackson leads the Democrats, with 18%. Gov. Michael Dukakis and Sen. Simon, the one who can't sing, are tied for second.    Vice President Bush is an easy winner among the Republicans, at 47%, 20 points ahead of the runner-up, Sen. Dole.    &quot;Aren't you embarrassed to give George Bush such a lift?&quot; publisher Phillips was asked. &quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;we think George Bush as a candidate will be good news for Spy magazine.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
