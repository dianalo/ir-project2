Morrison, director of the office of plansin State's Bureau of Administration and Information Management.andP;  &quot;Youwouldn't want to sit there for very long breathing halon.andP;  You'd start toturn purple.&quot;andM;Halon suppresses fire without damaging computers and electrical circuits aswater might.andP;  However, bills now pending in the Senate and House would phaseout production of halon and other chemicals that deplete the ozone layer.andM;The halon incident underscored State's urgent need for an alternate computingsite in case of real emergency.andP;  &quot;Right now the State Department has all itsmainframe computing eggs in one basket,&quot; Morrison said.andM;&quot;This center processes all our visa requests, which are extensive.andP;  Ithandles the archives of foreign policy documents, all the telegrams andcables.andP;  It handles our payroll and personnel systems.andP;  It is quite vital,but we have no backup.&quot;andP;  The department operates two IBM Corp. 3081s and a4381 in Washington, as well as three 4341s overseas in Paris, Mexico City andBangkok.andM;Officials worked with Congress and the Office of Management and Budget tofund a mainframe backup site, which is being built by the Army Corps ofEngineers as an extension to the departmental communications center inBeltsville, Md.andP;  The extension, known as the Beltsville InformationManagement Center, will house additional mainframes and office automationequipment, Morrison said.andM;The Washington computer center still remains worrisome.andP;  &quot;It's literallybeneath the delivery ramp at the State Department,&quot; Morrison said.andP;  &quot;It'sflat-roofed and subject to flooding.andP;  We've had occasions when we had to shutdown for several hours from flooding and air conditioning problems.&quot;andM;Although no critical operations failed, Morrison said he nevertheless fearsthe worst.andP;  &quot;When you consider that we would literally be out of business ifanything happened to the mainframe facility here, you have to count evenremote possibilities,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;We are going to sleep better once [the backup facility] is completed.andP;  Wereally feel very vulnerable at this point.&quot;andM;The Corps of Engineers expects to finish work at Beltsville early in 1991,Morrison said, and it will be fully operational in fiscal 1992.andP;  Besidesserving as backups, new computers at Beltsville will work in tandem withexisting ones to relieve some of the workload and allow the department tohandle extra processing.andM;&quot;One problem everyone has is the exponential growth of demand,&quot; Morrisonsaid.andP;  &quot;Even if you forecast like we do, you still tend to fall short.andP;  Thisway, we get a bit of a cushion.&quot;andM;Meanwhile, a State Department study team is trying to define the department'smainframe needs over the next 10 years, Morrison said.andP;  The study, performedwith the help of the Corps of Engineers, Federal Technology Corp. ofAlexandria, Va., and Strategica of Washington, will determine what computersthe Beltsville center gets.andM;The study, due for completion in December, also will consider overseasmainframe requirements.andP;  The three overseas centers handle payroll and otheradministrative functions for employees outside the U.S.andP;  Morrison saidBeltsville also will provide backup processing for those sites.andP;  Officialswill issue a request for proposals after they analyze the study.andM;The study group will recommend the most efficient way to network the newcomputers with off-the-shelf communications equipment and perhaps someexisting lines.andP;  &quot;The solution probably will involve a lot of T1[144-megabit/sec] circuits, encryption and fiber optics,&quot; Morrison said.andO;&quot;There is no technical hurdle we need to jump to make those connections.&quot;andM;In addition, the study will identify office automation equipment for theBeltsville center to back up the separate operations of the office of thesecretary of state and his deputies.andM;&quot;We want to have at least enough office automation equipment so that if, Godforbid, something were to happen in the building here, we could carry on thevital operations of the secretary and his staff from another location,&quot;Morrison said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
