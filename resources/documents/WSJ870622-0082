On average, doctors prescribe one or more drugs three out of every five times a patient visits their office. Indeed, in 44% of the office visits, drugs are the only form of therapy used.    According to a recent survey by the National Center for Health Statistics, physicians usually prescribe drugs by trade name. The generic name was used on the medical record only 18.6% of the time, down from 21.7% in 1981.    Not surprisingly, older people visit their doctor more often and account for most of the drug usage. At the time of the latest survey, people aged 45 and older were only 31% of the population but accounted for 53% of the doctor visits where drugs were prescribed.    As the population ages, the use of drugs for medical treatment will probably increase faster than it has in the past. The push to use cheaper generics may also intensify. But it appears that the use of trade names has grown recently at the expense of generics.    Teacher Shortage   A 20-year study of college freshmen by three University of California researchers shows a long-term decline in education as a career choice.    The latest data show that fewer than one freshman in 12 has any interest in teaching. In the late 1960s, about one-fourth of students said they intended to pursue teaching careers. The National Center for Education Statistics now predicts a severe teacher shortage by the early 1990s.    In place of teaching, more students appear to be attracted to business. One in five students said they would prefer a job in business compared with only one in 10 when the survey began. Ironically, rising demand for better-trained business workers, particularly in market analysis and information management, may be hampered by a lack of instructors.    This suggests that more businesses will have to depend on computers to help train new workers.    Credit Unions   At a time when headlines seem to be dominated by ailing thrifts or by banks struggling with foreign loans, one type of financial institution -- the credit union -- has quietly become increasingly popular.    According to the Credit Union National Association, 55 million Americans now have about $158 billion deposited in their credit unions, an increase of $29 billion from 1986. One reason for the surge may be that 95% of credit-union depositors (known as members) in a recent survey said they are confident of their credit unions' financial soundness. And 93% said the quality of services equals or exceeds that of other financial institutions.    The survey, by Concepts in Marketing Research of St. Paul, Minn., also found that most credit-union members are well-educated, middle-income, working-age people. Fifty-seven percent are between 30 and 54 years old and earn between $20,000 and $50,000 a year. Almost two-thirds have some college education or are college graduates.    Nearly all credit-union members join through their place of work. But the success and popularity of credit unions may mean that they will spread to areas outside the workplace and draw more deposits from banks and savings and loans. One indication: the chartering of a federal credit union by the 26 million-member American Association of Retired Persons.    Is the Owner Home?    As of March, the U.S had 100 million housing units, a 13% increase from 1980. Despite this growth, which was nearly double the population increase, the proportion of units that are owner-occupied has declined.    In 1980, 66% of all housing units were owner-occupied; by the end of 1986 the figure was down to 64%. The Census Bureau attributes the decline, the first since 1940, to a combination of increasing home prices and relatively high mortgage rates between 1980 and 1986.    If the decline were to continue, home builders and mortgage lenders might suffer. But analysts at the Census Bureau believe that even if home prices keep rising, the home-ownership rate won't drop any further. That's because in the future there will be fewer young first-time home buyers. The number of people in their twenties, who are most sensitive to price, is projected to decline by 17% in the next decade. </TEXT></DOC>
