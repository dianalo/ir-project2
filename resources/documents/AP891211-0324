Sets Special Dividend</HEAD><DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Holiday Corp. announced Monday itsboard of directors has approved payment of a special cash dividendof $30 per share by the Promus Companies Inc. after Promus is spunoff from Holiday. The dividend is $5 lower than originallyanticipated.   The dividend is one of several developments announced by theMemphis-based corporation in connection with the pendingacquisition of the Holiday Inn hotel system by Bass PLC of GreatBritain and the spinoff of a subsidiary, recently named Promus.   Promus, which will own Holiday's gaming operations and theEmbassy Suites, Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites hotel chains, willbe managed by the current Holiday Corp. senior management.   The payment of the dividend from Promus is subject to approvalof the transaction by stockholders at a meeting expected in January.   The corporation also announced an agreement with Sumitomo BankLimited providing financing for the special dividend.   ``Until recently, indications were that financing was availableon favorable terms to pay a $35-per-share dividend,'' said MichaelD. Rose, chairman, president and chief executive officer of HolidayCorp.   ``However, in the current financial markets, financing thatlevel of payment could be accomplished only at a cost significantlyhigher than originally planned,'' Rose said in a statement.   ``Therefore, management and our board believe it prudent to fixthe special dividend at $30 per share, which positions us tofinance our dividend through bank facilities and strengthens ourequity base for the growth of Promus' businesses.''</TEXT></DOC>
