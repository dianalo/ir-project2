The hospital is in the center of the rebel-held town and about amile from Jaffna Fort, controlled by government troops that claimthey defeated Tamil separatist guerrillas Thursday to end athree-month siege.   The government, meanwhile, warned citizens of possible attack byTamil forces in the northern Jaffna region, most of which iscontrolled by the rebels.   ``Due to the success of the security forces in the JaffnaPeninsula, the (Tamil Tigers) heirarchy has instructed its cadresto attack civilians,'' said a defense ministry statement issuedSaturday.   Military officials did not say how far their men had advancedtoward the hospital. But a senior officer said troops were underconstant rebel fire and progress was slow because of mines buriedin the streets and booby traps hidden in buildings along the way.   Control of the hospital would give the Sinhalese-dominatedgovernment a major base in the town of 60,000 people and, moreimportantly, a chance to win support among residents by resumingmedical services.   The overwhelmingly Tamil town 185 miles northeast of the capitalcity of Colombo has been a rebel stronghold since the separatistwar against Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority began in 1983.   But recent battles in the area and the rebel's strong-armtactics of soliciting funds has sapped enthusiasm for the guerrillacause in Jaffna, recent visitors to the town reported.   At least 14,000 people have been killed in the civil war.   The government says 25 soldiers have been killed and at least136 wounded since the siege on the 17th century fort was brokenThursday. It claims more than 100 Tamil rebels have died.   The Tamil office in London, however, denied the siege had beenbroken. The rebels also claimed they downed a government plane witha Soviet-made SAM-7 missile.   The government acknowleged a single-engine ground-attack planecrashed in Jaffna Lagoon on Thursday, but it said the pilot ditchedthe Italian-made Marchetti aircraft when he could not pull out of adive after attacking a rebel gun position. The pilot was reportedmissing.   Military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, alsoaccused the rebels of killing eight unarmed Moslem civilians,including four children, in eastern Sri Lanka Thursday night andFriday.   Four guerrillas were killed in clashes with government troops inthe region, the officials said.   The rebels seek political autonomy or independence for the Tamilminority, claiming Sinhalese discrimination in jobs, education anduse of the Sinhala language.   The Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the nation's 16million people, control the government and the military.   Tamils account for 18 percent of the people and live mostly inthe northern and eastern sections of the island nation. Moslemsmake up 7 percent of the population.</TEXT></DOC>
