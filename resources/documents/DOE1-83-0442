The use of Lithium started with 8 patients rather short-dated,at about the same time as the radio-iodine, and in the other cases wasalready started 10 days ahead and in all cases was continued up till7 days after the I-131 application. With a measuring device Anger-Kamerwith a pinhole collimator daily uptake measurements were made and afterevaluation by means of an EDV system activity-time curves were produced.A sonographic size determination of the remaining thyroid gland allowedits mass to be determined and a prediction to be made of the specificactivity increases in storing tissues. These values were compared withthose from a collection of previous patients who in the same diseasestage had received only conventional radio-iodine treatment. The criteriawere the radio-iodine kinetic with radio-iodine inflow and effectivehalf-lives as well as the absolute and maximum activity assimilationin the thyroid remains. The Lithium medication had no significant effecton any of the mentioned parameters in either the short-dated or the longer-dateddoses. (orig./MG)</TEXT></DOC>
