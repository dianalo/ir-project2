In a statement lodged with London's Stock Exchange, the KuwaitInvestment Office, which also holds a stake of about 20 percent inBritish Petroleum Co. PLC, said it bought 1.5 million Midlandshares on Friday. That lifted its holding to 28.04 million shares,or above 5 percent, requiring it to divulge the stake.   Midland shares rose on the news. The shares, which had been downabout 9 pence (15 cents), were down 6 pence (10 cents) at 415 pence($7.01) after the announcement.   An official at Midland Bank, who wasn't identified, inaccordance with British practice, said he had been aware of thestake for over a year, and that it appears to be just an investment.   ``We are pleased that someone thinks we are a good investment,''he added. ``It's as casual as that.''   An official at the Kuwait Investment Office, who wasn'tidentified for the same reason, declined to comment.   Other major shareholders in Midland include Hong Kong andShanghai Banking Corp. with 14.9 percent; M and G Group PLC, aninvestment management group, with about 7 percent; and Britishconglomerate Hanson PLC with about 5 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
