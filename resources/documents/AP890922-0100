Forecasters downgraded Hugo from a hurricane to a tropical stormthis morning, but warned it could spin off tornadoes as it headedacross North Carolina toward inland Virginia, then up theAppalachian Mountains to New York and New England.   Donald Maurer, a spokesman for the New York state DisasterPreparedness Commission in Albany said many people living inlandwrongly believe they're immune from tropical storms in theNortheast. ``That's not true. Some of the worst flooding in thisstate's history has been from storms like Hugo,'' Maurer said.   ``Two weeks ago, Hurricane Gabrielle only came within 500 milesof us and we had six deaths and five capsized boats,'' said CoastGuard Petty Officer Ken Arbogast in Boston. In that case, thehurricane was far out in the Atlantic.   At 9 a.m., Hugo's center was located just north of Hickory, N.C.,in the Blue Ridge foothills, and it was moving toward the northnorthwest at 25 to 30 mph, the National Weather Service said. Fearsof flooding moderated somewhat as the storm picked up speed on itsmarch northward, ensuring that rain wouldn't linger quite as longover any one place.   ``We're just hoping there aren't thunderstorms ahead of it,because that would mean a flood threat,'' said weather servicemetrologist Bill Coneaux.   Maximum sustained winds were estimated to have decreased to 60mph, with higher gusts in squalls. Hickory had gusts of up to 73 mphthis morning.   In Maryland and Delaware, from 5 to 10 inches of rain and windgusts of up to 70 mph were expected to buffet the Chesapeake regionthis afternoon.   With the storm expected to hit the Baltimore-Washington areaaround the afternoon rush hour, the District of Columbia, federaland Maryland governments told employees they could leave early ifnecessary, transit authorities added service and officials closedschools in the capital and its suburbs.   Ocean City, Md., canceled its annual Sunfest festival set forthis weekend, as hotels reported an increasing number of touristscalling off their beach visits.   In Nelson County, Va., where 128 people were killed in floods andmudslides caused by Hurricane Camille in 1969, workers hurriedly setup a network of electronic rain gauges to act as an early warningdevice, Sheriff William Harris said.   But to the 50 or so surfers in the water at Virginia Beach onThursday evening, thoughts of the coming storm centered on the waves.   ``It's pretty good right now,'' said Joe Wool, 23. ``The wavesare breaking about head high.''   Farther north, a flash flood watch was posted statewide in bothDelaware and Maryland, in addition to a high wind warning for NewCastle County, Del. Hagerstown, in western Maryland, could havewinds of 30 to 50 mph with higher gusts, the National WeatherService said this morning.   Tropical storm warnings remained in effect this morning fromVirginia Beach northward to Manasquan, N.J., including Chesapeakeand Delaware bays.   Commanders at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware ordered theevacuation of their fleet of jet transports late Thursday.   In New York, forecasters said vestiges of Hugo could cause severerain and flooding.   Hugo could hit New York State some time tonight or Saturdaybefore passing through southern New England, according tometeorologist Robert Barton in Albany.   Barton said there could be 2 to 4 inches of rain in parts of NewYork south of Albany, including New York City.   In Connecticut, forecasters said the state faces winds between 20mph and 40 mph in the Hartford area, with 2 to 4 inches of rainlikely by Saturday.   ``We will be spared a direct hit from the storm,'' said MelGoldstein, director of the Weather Center at Western ConnecticutState University in Danbury. ``We should be ready for some poweroutages and some localized flooding.''   Some Connecticut residents, particularly those living near LongIsland Sound, were not taking any chances.   In Greenwich, hardware stores were busy all day Thursday withcustomers buying everything from flashlights to waterproof tarps.   ``One guy came in and bought a generator. He said he was justtaking it for precaution,'' said Steve McDow, a salesman at theSuper Handy Hardware Center in Greenwich.   In Massachusetts, heavy rains with flooding in low-lying areaswere expected in the Boston area, according to Jim Roets, a NationalWeather Service meterologist.   The storm already has postponed a statewide shoreline cleanupscheduled for Saturday.   ``In the aftermath of the coming storm, e will need even morepeople available to help pick up all the debris that's bound to washup on our shores,'' said John DeVillars, state environmental affairssecretary.</TEXT></DOC>
