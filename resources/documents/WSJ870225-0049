In a meeting with Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) and other lawmakers, Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle said the Pentagon will make sure its anti-missile activities are in keeping with a narrow interpretation of the agreement pending a new State Department legal assessment of the broader interpretation. The State Department analysis won't be completed until May, officials said.    The Pentagon's latest stance reflects some backtracking on the matter. Last year, President Reagan said that the broader interpretation was legally correct, but that the U.S. would continue to abide by the stricter reading, which had been in place since 1972.    The slowdown and the additional analysis will serve to ease a heated controversy over whether the treaty allows full-fledged testing of anti-missile systems being researched under the president's Strategic Defense Initiative.    The State Department will analyze the ABM treaty from two vantage points. It will consider whether the Senate ratified the treaty in 1972 based on an understanding that the narrower interpretation would prevail. In addition, the analysis will focus on statements and actions by the U.S. and the Soviet Union since 1972 that would reflect the original intent of the treaty.    The stricter interpretation of the treaty would sharply limit tests of anti-missile systems outside laboratories. It would allow both superpowers to conduct full-scale tests of parts of space-based systems, but not the full systems.    The broader interpretation, which Pentagon officials have dubbed the LCI, for &quot;legally correct interpretation,&quot; would allow full-scale testing of systems based on physical principles that weren't known in 1972. Such systems include certain lasers, as well as some sensors.    The Reagan administration's move toward the broader interpretation has sparked protests in the Senate. Sen. Nunn warned that the administration might set off a &quot;constitutional crisis&quot; by adopting a reading of the treaty different from what the Senate understood to be the interpretation in 1972. Others warned that the move to a more permissive reading of the agreement would damage the prospects for reaching a new arms pact with the Soviet Union.    Sen. Nunn, responding to the decision to study the matter further, said the administration &quot;is going back to do in a thorough way what they should have done&quot; before declaring the more permissive interpretation to be legally acceptable. &quot;Better late than never,&quot; he added.    Arms-control advocates argue that the broader interpretation will accelerate development of space-based missile defenses, hastening an arms race that to date has been prevented by the ABM treaty. SDI researchers haven't themselves pushed for the new interpretation, however, because their anti-missile experiments have been designed to comply with the narrower interpretation.    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger earlier this month asked the SDI office to write a report of tests it would conduct under the broader interpretation. That report hasn't been submitted yet.    While the broader reading could advance testing of exotic, new anti-missile technologies, it wouldn't further the development of the systems that could be deployed as early as the mid-1990s, because these are based on physical principles that were known in 1972. </TEXT></DOC>
