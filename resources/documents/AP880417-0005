For one thing, it may be helping to keep President Reagan on thesidelines, even though Robertson's campaign poses no real obstacleto Bush's march to the GOP nomination.   Reagan vowed to remain neutral in the contest so long as therewas a battle among Republicans, even though his active support forBush was a foregone conclusion.   After Bush's main competitor, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, droppedout, the White House hinted that Reagan wanted to start stumpingfor Bush. But so far he hasn't scheduled any appearances.   Bush has 922 delegates and after the New York primary on Tuesdaymay have as many as 970 _ within easy grasp of the 1,039 needed forthe Republican nomination. By contrast, Robertson has a scant 17delegates.   Bush is still behaving as if he has some competition for thenomination. He campaigned last week in New York, and today beginsan Ohio and Pennsylvania swing in anticipation of primaries inthose states in the next two weeks.   Robertson's vow to ``energize people who support me'' on issuesalso raises the possibility of a platform battle at the GOPconvention, one Bush strategists would like to avoid.   For his part, Robertson has made no effort to contact Bush or totry to mend fences, according to the Bush camp.   ``I think he's plowed under,'' Bush said in a recentconversation with reporters on Air Force II.   Asked if some prominent Republican, perhaps Dole, might serve asa mediator between the two camps, Bush said: ``We don't need anymediation. We need our facts clear.''   Bush still has not spoken to Robertson, even though the two wereback-to-back speakers last Friday before the American Associationof Newspaper Editors in Washington.   Robertson still appears to be smarting at the drubbing hereceived from Bush, insisting to the newspaper executives on Fridaythat there were ``no differences in either education or incomelevel'' of those supporting him and those supporting Bush.   The major difference, Robertson suggested, is that ``George Bushwas regarded as Reagan the Second, or whatever, so they were votingagain for the man who they have voted for twice before _Reagan-Bush. I don't think anybody could have done much better.''   ``I'm not Don Quixote. I don't believe in tilting at windmills.It's obvious from the delegate count that has come out that GeorgeBush is going to be the nominee....''   But still, Robertson remains the only candidate of the originalfive Republicans challenging Bush for the nomination to persist inthe face of the vice president's steamrolling candidacy. Dole,former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, former Secretary of StateAlexander Haig Jr. and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York have all formallywithdrawn, releasing their delegates in the process.   Suggestions that Robertson feels he has been unfairly treated inthe process ``are absurd,'' Bush has said.   Bush spokesman Peter Teeley said no efforts have been made byBush or his advisers to try to persuade Robertson to bow outgracefully.   ``It would not be proper,'' Teeley said.   However, the aide said, ``His campaign for the most part isdormant. He's doing very little traveling. It's almost as if hiscampaign is nonexistent.''   Robertson's campaign has acknowledged he has spent nearly allthe money allowed for the primary season under federal spendinglimits. He has laid off most of his staff and confined hiscampaigning to an occasional trip.   As for Reagan's non-participation, Teeley suggested that mightchange ``once we have the delegates to go over the top.''   According to an Associated Press delegate count, that will comeno later than May 3 _ possibly even sooner};klZkl[ C</TEXT></DOC>
