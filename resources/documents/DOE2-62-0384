The experimental scrubber is capable of removing carbon dioxidefrom the storage environment without introducing oxygen, which is a problemwith most present commercial CO/sub 2/ scrubbers. Lime utilization efficiencywas compared with three cylinder rotational velocities, two lime slurryconcentrations, and three cylinder air velocities. Only the cylinderrotational velocity was found to have a significant effect on lime efficiency,which was greater than 90%. When the CO/sub 2/ absorption of the systemwas compared with the various test parameters, the results indicatedthat only the cylinder air velocity had a significant effect.</TEXT></DOC>
