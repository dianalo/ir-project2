Not only that, the minister is also the star of the ad campaign. &quot;This is a radical approach,&quot; admits the Rev. Kenneth Chalker, 37 years old, who became the principal minister of the inner-city church last summer.    Huge billboards on the side of Cleveland buses feature a photograph of the robed Rev. Chalker clutching a Bible under the headline: &quot;Our new pastor arrived complete with instruction manual.&quot; In radio spots on rock 'n' roll and soul music stations, the minister is beamed up, Star Trek-style, to meet &quot;The Big Guy.&quot;    Rev. Chalker is catching, ah, hell from parishioners and others for this approach. Critics say it's undignified, even blasphemous. The minister, noting that his church's membership has plunged to only about 200 people from a peak of more than 3,000 in the early 1920s, responds: &quot;This church could die with dignity.&quot; He says he wouldn't refer to God as &quot;The Big Guy&quot; in a church service, but adds: &quot;There's a great deal of humor in the Bible.&quot;    Rev. Chalker also says he has rejected as inappropriate some spots proposed by the church's ad agencies, including one for Christmas that said, &quot;We're throwing a party for our landlord.&quot;    The campaign is costing more than a third of the church's annual operating budget of $350,000. Rev. Chalker says he's risking the funds to prevent the 81-year-old church -- and its hand-painted ceilings, elaborate pipe organ and 100-foot tower -- from becoming &quot;a museum.&quot;    It's too early to measure the full impact of the campaign, which the minister began late last month and plans to continue for a year. But church attendance has doubled to more than 250 worshipers.    One ad describes First United as a &quot;relaxing alternative&quot; to the lunch-hour rush, a place to &quot;feast on a variety of music, from classical to modern,&quot; as well as an ideal place to stop on the way to a Cleveland Browns football game.    But, it adds, &quot;No fair praying for the other team.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
