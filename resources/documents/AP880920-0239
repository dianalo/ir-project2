But in many areas, including how they propose to reduce the hugefederal budget deficit or provide long-term health care for theelderly, each candidate has been purposely vague _ especially aboutthe cost of their good intentions.   As they prepare for a head-on collision on the issues in theirfirst nationally televised debate Sunday night in Winston-Salem,N.C., here is a look at the major stands of the Republican andDemocratic presidential candidates.</TEXT><HEAD>TAXES</HEAD><TEXT>   Bush's response to the question of tax increases consists ofthree words: ``No, no, no.'' He has vowed, ``I won't raise yourtaxes, period.'' He proposes to lower the 28 percent capital gainstax to 15 percent. Dukakis says that would cost the Treasury $30billion or more, but the vice president contends it will generatemore revenue than it loses. Bush also has suggested expensive newtax credits for oil and gas exploration and child care.   Dukakis says, ``No serious candidate for the presidency can ruleout the possibility that we will need new taxes to get our budgetdeficit down and our economy back on track.'' His first target: acrackdown on tax evaders who he says cheat the Treasury out of $110billion a year. If taxes prove necessary as a last resort, Dukakissays, ``I would see that they are raised on the basis of theability to pay.'' He opposes a cut in the capital gains tax,calling it a tax break for the wealthy.</TEXT><HEAD>DEFICIT</HEAD><TEXT>   Bush's solution to the annual $150 billion federal deficit is aso-called ``flexible freeze'' on all federal spending except SocialSecurity. It would allow government programs, including defense, togrow no faster than inflation. Some would have to be cut to allowfor spending increases that Bush has promised for education, childcare and other initiatives, but he has not specified where the cutswould come. He favors a line-item veto and a balanced budgetamendment to the Constitution. ``The most important action we needto take on the budget deficit is to hold the line on taxing andspending,'' Bush says.   Dukakis promises to make ``tough choices'' on spending, but forthe most part refuses to say where the ax would fall. He opposes abalanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, but favors line-itemveto authority for the president. He has said he does not envisionmajor cuts in domestic programs, and has hinted that any savingsfrom cutting back on the Strategic Defense Initiative and suchweapons as the rail-based mobile MX missile and Midgetman missilewould be offset by a buildup in conventional weapons. ``There areonly four ways to reduce the budget deficit: cut spending, increaserevenue, bring down interest rates and improve economicperformance,'' he said. ``We must do all four.''</TEXT><HEAD>DEFENSE</HEAD><TEXT>   Bush says, ``I believe that the (Reagan) administration'sapproach in rebuilding America's defenses is fundamentallycorrect.'' He has not suggested scrapping any Pentagon weaponssystems, although he says the proposed single-warhead Midgetmanmissile would be costly. He promises to press ahead with researchand eventual deployment of SDI, or Star Wars, the space-basedmissile defense system, although he cautions that a full deploymentwould be ``very expensive.''   Dukakis opposes the rail-based MX missile. He says the Midgetmanis strategically sound, but very costly. He is against plans tobuild two more Navy aircraft carrier task forces at a cost of $18billion each. He has called Star Wars ``a fantasy'' and says hewould reduce its research budget to $1 billion. Dukakis saysRepublican mismanagement has left the military short of tanks,artillery and other conventional weapons. He supports the Stealthbomber, Trident II submarine-based missiles, the advanced tacticalfighter, the SS-21 Sea Wolf fast-attack submarine and advancedcruise missiles, as well as more tanks and artillery.</TEXT><HEAD>CHILD CARE</HEAD><TEXT>   Bush, who says he wants ``a kinder and gentler nation,'' hasproposed a $2.2 billion federal income tax credit for low-incomeand middle-income families up to $20,000 a year to help paychild-care costs. The credit of up to $1,000 per child under age 4would be refundable for parents who don't earn enough to pay incometaxes. All low-income families with at least one working parentwould be eligible; the care could be provided by family, friends orin any type of day-care facility, including those run by churchesand synagogues.   Dukakis has endorsed the concept, but has not committed himselfto the cost, of a $2.5 billion, Democratic-sponsored bill thatwould funnel child-care aid to families earning up to 115 percentof median state income. The measure would establish and expandchild-care facilities nationally, with a national advisorycommittee establishing minimimum health and safety standards forboth day-care centers and homes. The bill has run into snags inCongress over restrictions on church-based day care.</TEXT><HEAD>ABORTION</HEAD><TEXT>   Both candidates say they personally are not in favor ofabortion. But Bush supports a constitutional amendment that wouldban abortion except to save the life of the mother or in cases ofrape or incest. Bush supports government financing of abortionsonly to save the mother's life.   Dukakis opposes efforts to outlaw abortion, saying the mattershould be left for women and their doctors to decide. He supportsgovernment financing of abortions for the poor.</TEXT><HEAD>AIDS</HEAD><TEXT>   Bush says, ``Continued research on the virus combined withpublic education and testing are the best path to curb the spreadof AIDS.'' He has said, ``We may have to spend even more'' in theAIDS fight than the government's current budget of nearly $1billion. He has urged states to routinely test marriage licenseapplicants, patients at clinics treating sexually transmitteddisease or drug abuse, and prison inmates. Records must be kept``appropriately confidential.'' Bush says children should be taught``essential facts about AIDS in a thoughful, sensitive manner,''and children who carry the virus should be allowed to stay inpublic classrooms with proper safeguards.   Dukakis promises to ``commit the resources necessary to preventthe spread of the virus, find a cure, develop a vaccine and carefor people with AIDS and AIDS-related complex.'' He says he willlead a ``massive public education campaign'' and teach the public``about both the facts and the myths of this terrible disease.'' Hesupports federal legislation to protect AIDS patients againstdiscrimination and impose penalties ``for violating people'sconfidentiality.'' He supports mandatory testing in the militaryand of immigrants from countries with high incidence of AIDS, aswell as in blood, sperm and organ donor banks.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
