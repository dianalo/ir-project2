(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Forget about mice. Researchers here areworking on a better lobster trap _ one that lets the lobstersescape.   Prompted by what they say are the needless deaths of 200,000lobsters a year when wooden traps break free of buoys and thelobsters starve, chemists at Stevens Institute of Technology aretrying out biodegradable plastic.   They have buried 16 plastic compounds in the seabed along theAtlantic coast, and will study the compounds this month, says KenGonsolves, a chemical engineer at Stevens' Polymer ProcessingInstitute.   The aim is to replace one or two of the slats in traditionaltraps with plastic that would deteriorate within a few months,letting lobsters break out, Gonsolves said. Wood traps take a yearor more to deteriorate underwater.   Stevens is working with the New Jersey Maritime SciencesConsortium, an alliance of Mid-Atlantic and New England colleges,under a $187,000 grant from the National Oceanographic andAtmospheric Administration.   Shrinking harvests could make lobstermen change to the escapabletraps as a way to save future stocks, says William Gordon of themaritime consortium.   Gonsolves suggested that the technology could also be applied tofishing and trawling nets, ``which continue to trap fish and seamammals after they are lost at sea.''</TEXT><HEAD>Radiotelescope Link Practice For Voyager Flyby Of Neptune</HEAD><DATELINE>SOCORRO, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists linked 30 radiotelescopes toreceive distant pictures of Neptune in a test-run for next summer,when they hope the Voyager probe will send back close-ups of theeighth planet.   The July 21 test linked the 27-dish Very Large Array here, twodishes at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex inBarstow, Calif., and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,Calif.   ``It's fantastic,'' Barbara Howie, a JPL spokeswoman, said ofthe pictures received July 21.   Voyager's was returned to ``cruise mode'' after the test toconserve energy, said JPL project manager Don Brown. Scientistshope the payoff will be pictures of Neptune from 3,000 miles.</TEXT><HEAD>Florida To Have Universe's Coldest Spot In New Physics Lab</HEAD><DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Physicists who want to study therotation of atoms hope to make them stand still by turning a lab inthe Sunshine State into the coldest spot in the universe.   The University of Florida's Microkelvin Research Lab will openin the early fall, and physicist Gary Ihas said, ``It is designedto take matter closer to absolute zero than it has ever beenbefore. We'll be able to get to within one-millionth of a degree ofabsolute zero _ to one microkelvin.''   Absolute zero, the theoretical point at which even the atoms inmatter stop moving around, is minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit, orzero on the Kelvin scale.   ``The coldest temperature in the universe, in the empty spacebetweeen galaxies, is about 3 degrees Kelvin, so this will beroughly 3 million times colder than that,'' Ihas said.   ``At extremely low temperatures, atoms slow to such an extentthat you can look at very small interactions, you can study themotion between the particles themselves,'' Ihas said. ``Looking atthings in that way allows you to understand the laws of physics inbasic, deeper ways.''   The lab, supported by a $1.3 million National Science Foundationgrant and private funds, consists of three 41-foot-deep pits tohouse cryostats, shielded refrigeration units. Footsteps can raisetemperatures 500 microkelvin, so huge shock absorbers will isolatethe cryostats and an electromagnetic shield will deflect radiowaves and other electrical disturbances.   The lab's chief purpose is research, but Ihas said, ``There arealways spinoffs that are unpredictable... not because we understandthe new physics and apply it, but because we stumble on tosomething, because of serendipity.''   One problem, he said, will be that ``since no one has reallybeen this cold, we don't know what kind of thermometer is going towork.''</TEXT><HEAD>Task Force Finds Slight Increase In Grizzly Bear Population</HEAD><DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thirteen years after thegrizzly bear was declared to be a threatened species, itspopulation in the Yellowstone area now is growing, according to atask force of scientists.   The scientists said they can't pinpoint the number of grizzliesbecause the ecosystem comprises 9,600 very rugged square miles but,there were at least 45 adult females in 1985, up from 32 in 1983.They figure 170 to 180 bears lived in the area and the populationis growing 0.07 percent to 1.5 percent a year.   ``This increase is partially a result of grizzly bear managementprograms,'' said the task force appointed by the InteragencyGrizzly Bear Committee. It cited the increase as cause for cautiousoptimism, noting ``The recovery and survival of the grizzly bear inthe Yellowstone ecosystem will require continued carefulmanagement.''   The grizzly bear has been protected since 1975 under the federalEndangered Species Act.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Aug. 4</NOTE></DOC>
