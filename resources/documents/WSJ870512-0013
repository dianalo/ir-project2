The move is the company's latest defense against a $67-a-share tender offer by Asher B. Edelman and Dominion Textile Inc. Burlington also recommended that its holders reject the Edelman-Dominion offer.    The Greensboro, N.C.-based textile concern said it would consider buying more than 30% of its shares outstanding. A Burlington purchase of 30% would have an indicated value of $640 million. The company didn't say how the buyback would be financed.    Individuals familiar with Burlington's strategy to avoid a hostile takeover said the offer is designed to convince holders that Burlington is valued at far more than the $67 a share that Mr. Edelman and Dominion have offered. &quot;The message is that this is an $80 stock, and not a $60 one,&quot; said one source close to the company.    But traders weren't convinced. Although Burlington shares closed yesterday at a 52-week high of $66, up $1.625, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the price was lower than that offered by Mr. Edelman and Dominion -- and far below Burlington's planned buyback price.    In New York, Mr. Edelman said he planned to continue the offer with Dominion for Burlington. He said Burlington's restructuring plan &quot;looks like a management entrenchment restructuring to me.&quot; In Montreal, Dominion declined comment.    The Edelman-Dominion offer has an indicated value of $1.58 billion for the shares Mr. Edelman and Dominion don't already own.    Burlington said it is considering several alternatives for the restructuring, including a leveraged buyout, a merger, or other business combination involving the company or one or more of its principal operating groups. Burlington also reiterated its threat to try to take over Dominion, and said its board is &quot;giving particular consideration&quot; to that option as an important part of its restructuring plan.    Burlington's lastest move surprised and puzzled some analysts who questioned how the company would finance the $640 million buyback. Burlington currently has long-term debt of about $392 million and cash on hand of about $40 million, according to analysts.    Analyst Linda R. Morris of Philadelphia's Provident National Bank said, &quot;I don't know that I would want to own what might come out of this. I question the company that would exist after this.&quot; The proposed buyback price is half of total shareholder equity, she said.    To finance the offer, which is expected to begin soon, Burlington might have to sell some assets with a result similar to the &quot;bust up&quot; scenario the company has charged that Mr. Edelman and Dominion would carry out should they succeed in acquiring the company, said Edward Johnson, director of Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben Inc.'s Johnson Redbook Service.    Many analysts and traders believe that Burlington's main motive is to scare away Mr. Edelman and Dominion.    Daniel J. Good, head of merchant banking at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. who is advising Mr. Edelman and Dominion, said that Burlington is &quot;going to have to do a whole lot more for shareholders than offering $80 a share for eight million shares.&quot; Mr. Good said the value of the company after Burlington's buyback would be about $50 a share.    A source familiar with Burlington said the company believes that the buyback leaves it &quot;plenty of flexibility&quot; if it wishes to find a &quot;white knight&quot; or undertake a leveraged buyout.    As previously reported, Burlington's investment bankers are known to have had contacts with representatives of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. and Gibbons Green Van Amerongen Ltd., both New York-based firms that specialize in leveraged buyouts. </TEXT></DOC>
