The armature is madefrom superconducting material and is levitated between the rails of thelauncher by the Meissner effect. The Meissner effect is created by coolingthe armature and subjecting it to a magnetic field. The armature configurationhas a closed-loop topology and defines two planes - one plane coincideswith the plane of the rails; the other plane is oblique to the first.The armature configuration, when placed between the rails receives anunbalanced Lorentz force which accelerates the armature.</TEXT></DOC>
