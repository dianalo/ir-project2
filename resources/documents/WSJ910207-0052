Last week, a class-action suit was filed in federal courtaccusing Pan Am Corp. of illegally discriminating againstIraqi nationals. The suit accused the airline of refusing totransport Iraqi nationals, regardless of whether they werelegal residents of the U.S. Although Pan Am wouldn't commenton the policy when the suit was filed, reservation agents atthe airline said they had been instructed not to allow anyIraqi passengers on flights.</LP><TEXT>   A company spokesman confirmed that the airline's currentpolicy is to allow Iraqi passengers who either have a U.S.passport or are resident aliens in the U.S. to take Pan Amflights.   Eric Lieberman, an attorney in New York handling theclass-action suit, said the apparent change in policy wouldprobably settle the suit. The Iraqi who filed the case is apermanent resident who came to the U.S. in 1984 and who fledIraq because of political persecution.   But Mr. Lieberman said it is possible that other Iraqinationals who aren't permanent U.S residents could stillpursue legal action against Pan Am. The class-action suitaccused the airline of discriminating on the basis ofnational origin. The suit said less-sweeping measures couldbe taken to improve security in light of the U.S. war withIraq.</TEXT></DOC>
