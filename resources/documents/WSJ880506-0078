Terms weren't disclosed.    With the agreement, CMS now has commitments for 91% of the natural gas it requires when its Midland cogeneration plant opens in 1990. It also has commitments for 68% of the gas needed by 1994.    CMS Energy, parent of Consumers Power Co., Michigan's largest utility, is the majority partner in a joint venture to convert Consumers Power's mothballed Midland nuclear-power plant into a gas-fired cogeneration plant. A cogeneration plant produces electricity and steam heat from a single fuel source.    The plant is expected to supply steam and electricity to Midland, Mich.-based Dow Chemical Co., a venture partner, and to electric customers of Consumers Power beginning in 1990. </TEXT></DOC>
