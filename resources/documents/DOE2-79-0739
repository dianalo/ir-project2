No. 4 AC Station is composed of five boilers;all pulverized coal, wall-fired units. To meet a stringent SO/sub 2/emission limitation, the station had been required to partially switchto a high cost, low sulfur coal. Inland Steel started the developmentof an economical limestone injection technology in 1983. The researcheffort lead to the development, installation, and testing of the technologyin Boiler 405 at Inland's No. 4 AC Station. Boiler 405 was constructedin 1980 and has a rated capacity of 75 MW. Tests of the technology beganin March, 1986. Several parameters were found to significantly impactSO/sub 2/ removal efficiency, including the molar Ca/S ratio, sorbentsize, sorbent distribution, and sorbent reactivity. Up to 50% SO/sub2/ removal could be achieved. There were no major boiler impacts dueto limestone injection. Only a minor problem with the ash removal systemwas observed. Based upon the positive experience in Boiler 405, anotherboiler of different design has been outfitted with the technology. Bothsorbent injection systems are currently being utilized on a 24-hour perday basis to achieve the SO/sub 2/ standard.</TEXT></DOC>
