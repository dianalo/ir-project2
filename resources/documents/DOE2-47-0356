In the area of forestry, the over-riding question is about thequantity of biomass available from woody plants, both from traditionalforestry practices and that which can be produced in special short-rotationenergy wood plantations. One possible technique to effectively and economicallysupply energy wood is through homogenization of the product coming fromthe forest through the process of chipping. A study partly financed bythe European Economic Community (EEC) has recently been completed. Bothextensive field and laboratory studies were undertaken to provide informationabout wood chipping for energy use in the following areas: 1) the amountand structure of the yield and surplus yield of biomass available throughprevailing forest harvesting techniques; 2) wood quality characteristicsof this biomass; 3) production techniques; 4) production costs; 5) marketpotential and 6) overall evaluation.</TEXT></DOC>
