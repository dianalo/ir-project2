The bank, which bought a 24.9 percent stake in the securitiesfirm in January, would increase its ownership to 100 percent underan agreement with the firm's London-based parent, Kleinwort BensonLtd., said Fuji Bank spokesman Tomonori Kobayashi.   ``It will probably cost us some $44 million,'' he said.   He said the bank was awaiting approval for the total buyout fromthe U.S. Federal Reserve Board, which is examining foreign firms'access to the Japanese government bond market.   The bank hoped for Federal Reserve approval by the end of theyear, Kobayashi added.   Fuji Bank, the No.3 Japanese bank, with assets totaling theequivalent of about $351 billion at the end of last year, has sixU.S. branches and bought the U.S. finance company Walter E. Hellerin 1984.   ``So this (Kleinwort) is our first securities firm, which webelieve will promote our securities business in the United States,''Kobayashi said.   Fuji's announcement came one day after officials of Dai-IchiKangyo Bank said the bank was negotiating to buy at least a share ofCIT group, a financial services subsidiary of Manufacturer's HanoverCorp.   If Fuji's purchase plan goes through, Japanese banks will bemanaging four of the 42 primary government securities dealers in theUnited States, said the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leadingeconomic journal.   The U.S. central bank voted in August to allow Japanese firms tocontinue to act as primary dealers in U.S. Treasury securities.Primary dealers, which may conduct business in government securitiesdirectly with the Fed, have access to advance information about noteand bond auctions.   The economic journal said Japanese banks are activelyestablishing such strengths in the United States mainly because theU.S. government has started reconsidering the border line betweenbank and securities operations.   Kleinwort Benson still holds 100 percent management rights at itssix branches in the United States, said Shigemitsu Minagawa,spokesman for the company's Tokyo branch, established eight yearsago.   He said Fuji Bank and Kleinwort Benson had maintained arelationship for quite some time in human resources and investment.   Other purchases of U.S. firms by Japanese banks include a 1984buyout of the Bank of California by Mitsubishi Bank and the Bank ofTokyo's purchase of Union Bank in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
