Kazimiera Prunskiene, a 47-year-old moderate, announcedher resignation after the Lithuanian parliament suspended hergovernment's decision to raise prices on many goods. The bigprice rises, which took effect Monday, sparked angry protestsoutside parliament Tuesday that threatened to worsen ethnicand political tensions.</LP><TEXT>   The disarray comes at a perilous time, just as many in theBaltic are urging a calm and united stand against theKremlin's latest strong-arm tactics. On Monday militaryofficials warned leaders of the three Baltic states that theywill use paratroops to round up thousands of draft dodgers inthe next few days. The announcement has been widelyinterpreted by Baltic leaders as an attempt by Moscow tointimidate, and perhaps even put down with force, theseparatist governments in the three republics.   &quot;Moscow is trying to create a conflict situation in theBaltics,&quot; said Edgar Savisaar, the prime minister of Estonia.Like other Baltic leaders, he fears the Kremlin plans amilitary strike while world attention is focused on thePersian Gulf.   The attempt by Lithuania to raise prices on many basicconsumer goods, such as butter and sausage, is in line withthe economic policies of its two Baltic neighbors of Latviaand Estonia. Mrs. Prunskiene, an economist, argued that theprice increases were needed to make the local economy moreindependent of central planners in Moscow.   But the issue was seized upon by non-Lithuaniannationalists, who staged a noisy protest outside therepublic's parliament Tuesday. Fearing that the demonstrationcould turn violent and be used as a pretext by the militaryto step in, Lithuania's president Vytautas Landsbergis issueda radio appeal for support.   The protest was quelled after some scuffling with police,but Mr. Landsbergis added to the political disarray byvoicing doubt about Mrs. Prunskiene's prices policy. The twohave been at odds for months over the republic's tactics asit seeks to gain its independence from the Soviet Union. Theparliament voted overwhelmingly to accept Mrs. Prunskiene'sresignation.   Meanwhile, the military commander of the Baltic region,Gen. Fyodor Kuzmin, warned local leaders in telephone callsMonday that the Red Army would resort to armed confrontationif its efforts to round up recruits were blocked. SeveralBaltic leaders, including Estonia's Mr. Savisaar, say theyexpect any armed clampdown to be met by mass civildisobedience. But some admit that civil disobedience couldbackfire, giving President Mikhail Gorbachev a pretext toestablish direct rule in the republics, backed by the RedArmy.   The governments in the three republics are thus caught ina bind. Though they fear the expected attempts by Sovietparatroops to enlist recruits by force over the next fewdays, they also worry about provoking more turmoil by tryingto interfere. So far, Estonia has temporarily suspended itsprogram of alternative service for youths who don't want tojoin the army. And the Latvian parliament yesterday assailedthe Soviet military's conscription campaign as &quot;an act ofdirect aggression and crude violation of state independence&quot;and ordered citizens not to cooperate with it.   Mavriks Vulfson, a Latvian deputy in the Sovietparliament, told reporters: &quot;We won't tell {draft dodgers} tojoin up, but we'll say maybe it's better for them either togo {to the military} or to hide.&quot;   Several Baltic leaders are now pinning their hopes onWestern pressure on Mr. Gorbachev. &quot;We think the fate of theBaltic republics is in the hands of the world communitytoday,&quot; Mr. Savisaar told reporters. &quot;As long as anoninterference policy is carried out by the West, the Balticindependence movement will be suppressed by Moscow.&quot;   In Washington, the Bush administration shifted course andcriticized Moscow for sending troops into the Baltics andfour other republics. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwaterdeclared: &quot;This action represents a serious step toward anescalation of tension within the U.S.S.R.,&quot; adding, &quot;The U.S.urges the U.S.S.R. to cease attempts at intimidation and turnback to negotiations that are conducted free of pressure andthe use of force.&quot; He said the U.S. &quot;supports the aspirationsof the Baltic peoples to control and determine their ownfuture.&quot;   The formal White House statement marked the end of U.S.reluctance to criticize the Gorbachev regime, which has beenan important ally in the Persian Gulf crisis. But Mr.Fitzwater said there isn't any current plan to delay the Feb.11 U.S.-Soviet summit or hold up federal grain creditsrecently extended to Moscow.   A senior State Department official said, &quot;There are toomany important things in that relationship to just throw itaway, and I don't think the president will do that,especially now&quot; that the Gulf crisis is heating up. Congress,however, might block further aid to Moscow to protest thecrackdown.</TEXT></DOC>
