In 1975, there was the H.J. Heinz Co. bid for Staley. Mr. Nordlund quickly squelched it, and began an anti-takeover weapons buildup of Pentagon proportions. Then came the nastiness with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. last year. Replying with volleys of litigation, Staley accused the New York investment house of trying to &quot;extort&quot; it into a takeover. And now there is the Tate andamp; Lyle PLC offer.    Mr. Staley, who runs a media-buying company in Chicago, also criticizes Mr. Nordlund for ignoring family interests, for picking what he says is a board of mostly yes-men and for the way in which he took over. &quot;Don was in the No. 2 position at the time my father became very seriously ill. Don sent a piece of paper to the hospital asking to be appointed CEO while my father was incapacitated. He never really let go of that,&quot; Mr. Staley says, contending that although his father eventually recovered, he was unable to persuade Mr. Nordlund to give the family more representation on the board. &quot;Additional representation was vehemently denied by Mr. Nordlund,&quot; Mr. Staley says.    Mr. Nordlund couldn't be reached for comment, but a company spokesman said &quot;over the years Mr. Nordlund's relationship with the Staley family has been cordial and positive.&quot;    One of Mr. Staley's brothers, Henry M., sits on the company's board but declined to comment yesterday on Mr. Nordlund other than to say, &quot;I don't want to get involved in this thing. It won't do anybody any good.&quot; Now a retired company vice president, Henry Staley holds 68,666 shares of Staley stock. Gene Staley holds 40,000 shares.    Another retired Staley employee, H. Lee Crouse, who was a division director, calls Mr. Nordlund &quot;a hard-nosed manager. His idea was to make the company a success, get it out of the past. Everything he's been doing was for the purpose of taking a company that was dying on its feet and pulling it out. He's done a very successful job.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
