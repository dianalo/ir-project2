<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-44-0069 </DOCNO><TEXT>The transfer-ionisation Auger processes involving two active electronsin slow collisions of multiply charged ions with atoms are considered.The corresponding multi-channel coupling problem is approximately reducedto interaction of three quasistationary states. The three-state S matrixis constructed by assuming a weak overlap of the two-state non-adiabatictransition regions and applying a matching procedure. Closed-form expressionsfor transition probabilities are given for each transfer-ionisation channelfor two typical configurations of the initial, one-electron and two-electroncapture potential curves.</TEXT></DOC>
