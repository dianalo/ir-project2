BillBritt was 52.   Britt's badly decomposed body was found by his son and daughterin his hut about 30 feet from the fence surrounding the EvergreenCemetery in Boston's Brighton district, spokesman Scott Gillis said.   Britt, born Britton William Boughner in the affluentneighborhood near the state-owned land, had lived at the reservoirnear Boston College since 1969.   ``In his case, he felt that this was where he wanted to live,this was his estate,'' said Clyde Raymond, a friend of Britt's.``He died free, so to speak. He had his own drummer and he stuckwith it.''   Britt, who was known as the ``hermit of Chestnut Hill,'' hadbeen dead for several months and his body, dressed in multiplelayers of clothing, was almost reduced to skeletal, Gillis said.   An autopsy was performed on Britt in an attempt to determine thecause of death, but results weren't expected until Tuesday, Gillissaid.   In 1985, officials started trying to move Britt from theMetropolitan District Commission land in the Chestnut Hill districton the Boston-Brookline border.   Britt, who was legally blind, lived on money he earned redeemingcan and bottle deposits. He refused welfare and several attempts torelocate him to public or subsidized housing.   In May, Britt's plastic and wood wigwam was destroyed in a firewhile he was in New York City to appear on the ``Late Night withDavid Letterman'' television show. He rebuilt it, despitedeteriorating health. Doctors said Britt, who was nearly toothless,had ulcers and needed a corneal transplant.</TEXT></DOC>
