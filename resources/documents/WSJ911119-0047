An Airbus executive in Tokyo refused to comment on thenewspaper's report, referring calls to the group's Europeanheadquarters. A spokesman for Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd.,another top Japanese aircraft maker, said that company hadhad no &quot;formal&quot; approach from Airbus.   Any such European-Japanese alliance probably would beyears away and even then would be viewed by many as unlikelybecause of the long and close relationship that Mitsubishi,Kawasaki and the other major Japanese companies have had withBoeing Co. of Seattle.   &quot;Boeing has also asked Mitsubishi whether we're interestedin developing a super jumbo jointly,&quot; the Mitsubishispokesman said, so any partnership with Airbus would &quot;be veryhard because of our long relationship with Boeing.&quot;   Still, some U.S. industry leaders, particularly at Boeing,have been nervously monitoring Japan's flirtation with newaircraft partners in recent months.   The latest discussions with Airbus come as McDonnellDouglas Corp. and Taiwan Aerospace Corp. continue tonegotiate an arrangement that could give the Taiwanesecompany as much as a 40% stake in McDonnell Douglas'scommercial aircraft business.   Such an agreement, designed to provide as much as $2billion for McDonnell Douglas to use in developing its MD-12jumbo jetliner, could be part of an Asian-U.S. consortiumthat the St. Louis-based company wants to form, possiblyassigning as much as 49% of its commercial business tointerests in Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Singapore.   While many U.S. congressmen have complained that closecooperation between U.S. and Japanese aircraft companies willonly help make Japan a competitor in that field, industryexecutives say that such complaining will only persuade theJapanese to look elsewhere. As the cost of aircraftdevelopment skyrockets, Japanese capital and know-how will becrucial for development projects.   Since a congressional attempt two years ago to scrap jointdevelopment of the FSX military plane by Mitsubishi andGeneral Dynamics Corp., European makers have significantlyincreased their contacts in Japan. In addition, Boeing'sreluctance to give the Japanese a bigger share in thedevelopment of its 777 commercial aircraft reportedlydisappointed the Japanese.</TEXT></DOC>
