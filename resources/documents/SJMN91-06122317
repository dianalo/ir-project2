That is a great deal more than the$360,000 the state Department of Transportation has agreed to pay for theproject.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Extra 3  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LOS GATOS TO SAVE BERRY FARM DESPITE COST  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Because of that nearly $600,000 estimate, Building Services Director ScottBaker recommended the town tear down the farmhouse and build a replica of itat the site officials selected -- the town's corporation yard on Miles Avenue.The proposal called for parts of the old farmhouse to be saved andincorporated in the replica. The tower would be saved in its entirety andmoved.;    But the town's vocal preservationists urged that the building,which officials designated a historic structure to save it from Highway 85demolition, be preserved no matter what it cost.;    Town council membersended up agreeing and saying they would add $100,000 to the state's $360,000to move the tower and farmhouse, install a foundation and basically make itweather-tight. But there would not be any money left to do any immediaterestoration, and the buildings, which the town wants to use to house its parksand forestry department, would remain vacant and in disrepair until theadditional money is found.;    The farmhouse currently is old and vulnerable,but the state, which owns it, has been renting it to tenants for severalyears. The 2,982-square-foot house will be split into five pieces for themove, scheduled for October.;    When they are set down at their permanentlocation next to the current parks and forestry building, the house and towerwill be visible from Highway 17, just as they are now.;    While a majority ofthe council supported restoring the berry farm buildings, Councilman RandyAttaway, mindful of the town's grim fiscal predicament, could not.;    &quot;Weneed to be fiscally responsible right now,&quot; Attaway said. &quot;We need to look atthe overall benefit to the community and make sure we first take care ofkeeping our library open, keeping our school crossing guards and supportinglife-saving social services for our residents.&quot;;    Mayor Brent Ventura, thecouncil's strongest advocate for historic preservation, countered that thetown went to a lot of trouble to designate the farm as historic &quot;and I don'twant to be a party to taking $360,000 and not saving the building. I don'twant this council to go down with the legacy of those who tore down the traindepot and the Lyndon Hotel.&quot;;    Ventura said once the buildings are moved heis sure that community volunteers will come forward to help restore it, asthey have done in the past with other historic projects.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CONNIE SKIPITARES, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910501  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  492  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 1, 199100122317,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
