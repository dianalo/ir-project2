Evangelist Oral Roberts told the crowd this afternoon how he hadbeen cured of tuberculosis 53 years ago by ``a man of God.''   ``The man of God laid hands on me in Jesus' name and said, `Youfoul disease, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ, you comeout of this boy.' And brothers and sisters, it was resurrection, itwas divine intervention,'' Roberts said to a cheering audience.   ``I stand here today, 53 years later, with my lungs sound andwhole, my body healed by the power of God.''   Earlier, the Rev. Gerald Derstine of Bradenton, Fla., one of thefirst speakers at the ``Washington for Jesus'' rally, spoke ofChristians repenting for the sins of the nation.   ``I am talking about drug addiction, alcoholism and suicides. Wefeel prayer in the schools is still an important issue and webelieve abortion still is an issue,'' Derstine said.   Organizers said the rally attracted people from all 50 statesand from more than 100 countries. Members of many Christiandenominations were present; most of those in attendance wereevangelicals.   Sponsors said they expected 350,000 people would brave the rainand cool weather to join in the continuous, dawn-to-dusk prayersand songs. At noon, a U.S. Park Police spokeswoman, who would notgive her name, said the crowd numbered about 80,000.   A similar rally in 1980 drew an estimated 200,000 people.   When the rally ends, seven days of around-the-clock prayers willbegin on the site of the rally.   Tom Robidoux of Norwalk, Conn., said he took the day off fromwork to attend because he felt it would be ``very uplifting to seethis many people all doing the same thing.''   ``I believe the United States thinks Christians are dividedagainst one another,'' Robidoux said. ``We're here to show we canstand together.''   Dae Anne Fletcher said she traveled to Washington fromClarksburg, W.Va., because ``I just wanted to add my voice to thoseof many others.''   Before the rally began, the Rev. John Gimenez, pastor of RockChurch in Virginia Beach, Va., said participants ``are going toWashington to pray. We're not going there to condemn. We're notgoing to denounce. We're going there to point the finger atourselves.''   Indeed, organizers adi the sex-and-money scandals that haverocked television evangelism gave added impetus to today's rally.   The rally's aim, Gimenez said at a news conference Thursday, isto show repentance ``so we can be more effective,'' to reconciledifferences within the church and between races and neighborhoodsand to ``restore the church to holiness.''   ``When we started organizing this, there were no publicizedscandals in the church,'' Gimenez said of the sex-and-moneytroubles that brought down television evangelists Jimmy Swaggartand Jim and Tammy Bakker. ``The scandals just emphasize the needfor we who are Christians to come together.''   Today's rally was intended to be non-political, and that's whynone of the presidential contenders was invited to speak, Gimenezsaid. Pat Robertson, who is seeking the Republican nomination forpresident, was one of the key speakers at the rally eight years agobut was not invited to speak this time, Gimenez said.   An exception for political figures was made for a videotapedmessage from President Reagan.   Although the rally was dedicated to reviving old-fashionedChristian values, it relied on the latest in technology to get itsmessage across. Four huge screens, similar to those in baseballparks, were set up to show the activities on stage and messageslike those from Reagan.   John Staggers, chairman of the D.C. Networkers for ChristianAffairs in Washington, said he was impressed by the rallyorganizers' determination to help the residents of Washington.   ``I'm usually against groups that come to Washington for a dayand leave us with our problems,'' Staggers said.   Organizers asked each of the participants to bring a can of foodfor the poor and the homeless, and they agreed to helpWashington-area churches set up drug treatment centers.</TEXT></DOC>
