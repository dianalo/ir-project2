In a 23-page complaint filed in New York Supreme Court, thestate's trial-level court, Jerome Kohlberg Jr. alleges that Henry R.Kravis and George R. Roberts sharply cut back on his stake inseveral companies they had acquired jointly through the New Yorkfirm.   ``We are saddened that Mr. Kohlberg felt it necessary to sue hispartners and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts,'' a spokesman for Kravis andRoberts told The New York Times. ``We believe he is wrong both as tothe facts and his interpretation of the agreement between us, and wefully expect to prevail in court.''   Kohlberg, 64, resigned in 1987 from the firm he helped found in1976, citing philosophical differences with his former partners. Heremained a limited partner in the firm, which removed him frommanagerial duties but enabled him to continue to participate as aninvestor in KKR deals.   Kohlberg's suit contends his former partners used the opportunitypresented by several refinancings of old deals to declare them newtransactions under the terms of their agreement and to reduce hisownership position.   Kohlberg charges that in doing so, his former partners havebreached their ethical and fiduciary duties.   His suit also suggests that his former partners identifiedcertain deals that were lucrative and then increased their stake inthose deals at the expense of investors whose money they weremanaging.   KKR's investors include a number of state and corporate pensionfunds, who might feel they also were shortchanged should Kohlberg'saccusations be found true.   Kohlberg now runs his own investment firm.   KKR has raised billions of dollars for corporate takeovers. Itsmost spectacular deal was the $25 billion leveraged buyout of RJRNabisco Inc., completed earlier this year. The deal was the largestever.   In a leveraged buyout, the assets of the target company are usedas collateral to raise the money needed to buy all the firm's stock,transforming it into a private company.</TEXT></DOC>
