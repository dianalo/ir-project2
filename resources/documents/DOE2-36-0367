Analogies have been drawn between the immune systemand the nervous system. The immune system performs pattern recognitiontasks, learns and retains a memory of the antigens that it has fought.Interactions between these cells and molecules are slowly being elucidated.Theoretical ideas have played a major role in the development of thefield. Controversies such as instructive vs. selective theories of antibodyformation, germ-line vs. somatic mutation models for the generation ofantibody diversity, and regulatory circuits vs. idiotypic networks havedominated both the intellectual development of the field and determinedthe direction of much experimental effort. Quantitative theories, haveto date not been significant in the intellectual development of the field.This may be changing as the field addresses more quantitative issuessuch as the role of somatic hypermutation in the generation of antibodydiversity, the role of receptor clusters in cell stimulation and desensitization,etc. Quantitative theories will also be essential for the developmentof global models of the immune system in which both the spatial and temporalaspects of humoral and cell-mediated responses are integrated into asingle model, and may well be needed in order to understand the roleof idiotypic networks in immune regulation.</TEXT></DOC>
