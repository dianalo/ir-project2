Limits on tanks, armored troop carriers and artillery piecesby the NATO allies and the Soviet bloc, ceilings already proposedby the West. Bush said his plan would seek to ``lock in Easternacceptance'' of the Western limits of 20,000 tanks, 28,000 armoredtroop carriers and 16,500 to 24,000 artillery pieces, the precisenumber depending on how those weapons are defined.   Once the weapons are cut, they would be destroyed. The WhiteHouse said that would ``oblige the East to destroy tens ofthousands of weapons systems,'' in order to eliminate its widemargin in those arms.   According to NATO, the West has 16,424 main battle tanks and theWarsaw Pact has 51,500 heavy tanks, with announced cuts to reducethat number to 39,500.   2. Reductions by each side in land-based combat airplanes andhelicopters to levels 15 percent below the current NATO level.Those limits would apply from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains.Including those weapons would expand the conventional arms talks,something the Soviet Union has sought.   According to NATO, the Western alliance now has about 2,400combat helicopters in active units, while the Warsaw Pact nationshave 3,700. There are nearly 4,000 combat aircraft in NATO andabout 8,250 in the Eastern bloc alliance, which has announced plansto cut that number to 7,320.   Under the Bush plan, the affected aircraft would be destroyed.   3. The United States would make a 20 percent cut in its combatmanpower in Europe, to about 275,000, and that would become theceiling for Soviet forces stationed in other eastern Europeannations. That manpower ceiling would require the Soviets to reducetheir forces in Eastern Europe by about 325,000. The withdrawntroops would be demobilized.   4. Both sides would accelerate the timetable for reaching anagreement on conventional forces in Europe and for implementing theresultant cuts. Bush said there should be agreement within sixmonths to a year, with the reductions to be effective by 1992 or1993. The Soviet Union has set a 1997 target date for agreement..</TEXT></DOC>
