Past, current and possible future trends inthe emissions of the greenhouse gases are summarized. The limitationsand results of models to study possible climatic changes are discussedand evidence from empirical studies appraised as a means of detectingsuch changes. Precautionary measures concerned with abatement and controlof CO{sub 2} emissions are outlined. These include improved energy useefficiency, substitution of energy sources as well as recycling, removal,utilisation and disposal of CO{sub 2}. It is concluded that future emissionsof the greenhouse gases form one of the greatest sources of uncertainty.Climatic model results suggest that there will be a noticeable globalwarming in one or two decades with more uncertain regional changes. Observationsare consistent with these results. An improved understanding of suchclimatic changes is required to provide a firmer basis for policy decisions.The scope of the report excludes the potentially detrimental or beneficialeffects of a climatic warming on human welfare and hence also policiesof adaptation to such changes. 167 refs., 19 figs., 13 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
