The regulation requiresbanks \1\<NOTE/> to make funds available to their customers within specifiedtimes to disclose their funds availability policies to their customers,and to handle returned checks expeditiously. Since the publication of RegulationCC, the Board has received numerous requests from banks and others forclarification of various provisions of the regulation. The Board believesthat the proposed changes to Regulation CC and its Official Commentary(Appendix E) respond to many of these questions and would aid banks inunderstanding and complying with the regulation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Regulation CC defines the term ``bank'' to include alldepository institutions. 12 CFR 229.2(e).The proposed amendments may be summarized as follows:Section 229.2 Definitions.(d) <T3>Available for withdrawal.</T3> The Commentary states that funds areconsidered to be available for withdrawal even though they cannot be usedbecause they are subject to garnishment, tax levy, or court order restrictingdisbursements from the account. The Board proposes to amend the Commentaryto make it clear that when a bank places a hold on funds or sets fundsaside as a result of the certification of a check, a check guaranty, purchaseof a cashier's check, or similar transaction, the bank has not failed tomake funds available for withdrawal. This change would make it clear thatbanks are permitted under the regulation to place a hold on the funds representedby a check certified or purchased and not debit the account until the checkis presented for payment.(e) <T3>Bank.</T3> the Board proposes to amend the definition of ``bank'' byadding agencies of foreign banks that are located in the United States.The Expedited Funds Availability Act definition of ``depository institution''includes ``an office, branch, or agency of a foreign bank located in theUnited States.'' 12 U.S.C. 4001(12). The definition of bank in RegulationCC originally included only branches of foreign banks as defined in theInternational Banking Act (12 U.S.C. 3101). In some cases, agencies offoreign banks, however, may hold accounts and pay checks. Accordingly,it is appropriate to cover agencies of foreign banks as well as branches.Other officies of foreign banks in the United States are not permittedto hold accounts. This amendment would become effective 120 days followingits final adoption to provide agencies of foreign banks sufficient timeto implement the requirements of Subpart B.The Board also proposes to amend the Commentary to the definition of ``bank''by clarifying the status of Edge Act corporations, agreement corporations,and commercial lending companies (such as banking companies incorporatedunder Article XII of the New York Banking Law) under the regulation. Congressdid not include these corporations under the definition of ``depositoryinstitution;'' consequently, the Board did not subject them to the availabilityand disclosure requirements of Subpart B of Regulation CC. For purposesof Subpart C, however, the term ``bank'' also includes any person engagedin the business of banking. Edge Act coprorations, agreement corporations,and commercial lending companies do pay checks and drafts and would generallybe considered to be engaged in the business of banking. Therefore, theboard proposes to amend the Commentary to clarify that Subpart C also appliesto these entities.(f) <T3>Banking day</T3> and (g) <T3>Business day.</T3> The commentary to these definitions states thatdeposits made to an ATM are considered made at the branch holding the accountinto which the deposit is made for the purpose of determining the day ofdeposit. The Board believes that it is appropriate to apply this rule todeposits made at off-premise facilities, such as remote depositories andlock boxes, as well as at ATMs. All other deposits should be consideredmade at the branch at which the deposit is received. The Board proposesto revise the Commentary accordingly.(k)<T3> Check.</T3> The Commentary states that a credit card draft is notconsidered a check for purposes of the regulation. The Board proposes toclarify the term ``credit card draft'' by revising the Commentary to specifythat the term includes sales drafts used by merchants or generated by banks,but excludes checks that banks provide to their customers as a means ofaccessing credit lines without the use of credit cards.(z) <T3>Paying bank. </T3>The definition of paying bank includes the stateor unit of general local government on which a check is drawn. Some statesand local governments issue drafts drawn on themselves, but designate thedrafts as payable through or at a bank. The Board proposes to amend thedefinition of paying bank to provide that a state or unit of general localgovernment is a paying bank only if the check is actually sent to the stateor unit of general local government for payment or collection. A relatedamendment is proposed for the warranty provisions in andSection; 229.34 (a)and (b). (bb) <T3>Qualified Return Check. </T3>The regulation defines a qualified returnedcheck (``QRC'') as one that has been prepared for automated return to thedepositary bank by placing the check in a carrier envelope or placing astrip on the check and encoding the strip or envelope in magnetic ink.Under andSection; 229.31(a), a returning bank's return deadline is extendedby one business day if the returning bank converts a returned check toa QRC. Under the current regulation, returning banks that might want to use anothertechnology for automating returned check processing may not extend theirreturn deadline when using a methodology other than that defined for aqualified returned check. A broader definition of qualified returned checkwould provide incentives for banks to develop other methods for automatingreturns that might be more efficient. If, however, the definition of qualifiedreturned check were broadened to make various methods of automating thereturn of unpaid checks more acceptable, the likelihood that all banksinvolved in handling a given return will be using the same automated systemis diminished, thus reducing the efficiency of any of the systems. Therefore,it might be desirable to continue the current restrictions on the use ofalternative technologies.  The Board requests comment on whether banks need a broader definition ofqualified returned checks to accommodate different technologies. For example,an alternative of the qualified returned checks, the ``Speedy Return Plan,''was issued for comment in December 1987 as part of longer-term initiativesfor improving returned check processing. See 52 FR 47179 (December 11,1987). This alternative program differs from the qualified returned checkbecause it would use electronic files rather than envelopes or strips todirect the returned check to the depositary bank. Comments on this alternativemethod of automating returns indicated that it should be explored further. In addition, the Board requests comment on whether banks would use an alternativemethod of qualifying returns if it were available and whether the numberof alternative methodologies allowed should be limited. The Board alsorequests comment on whether a returning bank should be permitted to extendits return deadline by the additional day to prepare the return for processingusing another technology if the return had originally been qualified bythe paying bank. In addition, the Board proposes to clarify the Commentary to indicate thatQRCs prepared using envelopes preprinted with the return item identifiermay conform to the guidelines established in <T3>Specification for the Placement and Location of MICR Printing, X9.13</T3>by the American National Standards Committee on Financial Services(Sept. 8, 1983) (``ANSI guidelines'') for the external processing code(``EPC'') field for printing the identifier. The ANSI guideline statesthat the EPC field is located within \1/4\ inch to the left of the routingnumber, thus allowing the identifier to be in either position 44 or position45 on preprinted envelopes. (cc) <T3>Returning bank. </T3>The definition of ``returning bank'' in RegulationCC states that a returning bank is a collecting bank for purposes of U.C.C.andSection; 4-202(1)(e), which specifies a collecting bank's duty to notifyits transferor of delays in transit. On further consideration, the Boarddoes not believe that it is necessary for Regulation CC to require thata returning bank notify its transferor or any loss or delay in transit,and therefore proposes to delete this reference from the definition. Areturning bank would still be a collecting bank for purposes of U.C.C.andSection; 4-202(2), which sets out when a collecting bank's action wouldbe considered to be seasonable. (kk) <T3>Unit of general local government. </T3>The Board has been asked whetherIndian nations are considered to be units of general local government withinthe meaning of Regulation CC. The Act provides next-day availability forchecks drawn by a unit of general local government. Under the Act, a unitof general local government is defined as any city, county, town, township,parish, village, or other general purpose political subdivision of a state.As Indian nations are not subdivisions of the states, Indian nations arenot units of general local governments within the meaning of the Act, andthe Board consequently proposes to revise the Commentary to make it clearthat Indian nations are not included within the meaning of this term.Section 229.10 Next-day availability. <T3>Certain check deposits. </T3>The Board proposes to clarify that banksare required to provide next-day availability (or two-day availabilityunder andSection; 229.10(c)(2)) only for those Federal Reserve Bank and FederalHome Loan Bank checks that are encoded with a routing number listed inAppendix A to the regulation. Bank generally must rely on the routing numberto determine whether these checks are subject to next-day availability,because the banks cannot require the use of special deposit slips to identifythem. The routing numbers assigned to the Federal Reserve Banks and FederalHome Loan Banks may change from time to time, and the Board does not believethat banks should be held liable for not providing next-day availabilityfor a Federal Reserve Bank or Federal Home Loan Bank check that containsa newly issued routing number that has not yet been included in AppendixA. The Board will update Appendix A periodically to incorporate recentlyissued Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank routing numbers.The Board proposes to add a sentence to the Commentary to andSection; 229.10that points out that traveler's checks are also entitled to next-day availabilitywhen they are deposited to new accounts, cross-referencing the new accountexception in andSection; 229.13. <T3>Deposits made to an employee of the depositary bank. </T3>In most cases,andSection; 229.10(c) conditions next-day availability on the check beingdeposited in person to an employee of the depositary bank. Deposits madethrough the mail or at an ATM or night depository must be made availablenot later than the second business day after the banking day of deposit.Some questions have been raised about the meaning of the term ``in personto an employee of the depositary bank,'' e.g., does it cover situationswhere a bank sends a courier to the customer to pick up checks for deposit?The language used by the Act is ``deposited in a receiving depository institutionwhich is staffed by individuals employed by such institution,'' 12 U.S.C.4002(a)(2), and the Act defines ``receiving depository institution'' tomean ``the branch of a depository institution or the proprietary ATM inwhich a check is first deposited.'' 12 U.S.C. 4001(20). The Board interpretsthese provisions as requiring next-day availability only for deposits madeto staff of the depositary bank at a branch of the bank. Under andSection;229.10(c)(2), second-day availability would apply to deposits describedin this section that are made at a teller station staffed by a person thatis not an employee of the depositary bank (e.g. a shared staffed tellerfacility located in a retail store), and to deposits picked up at the customer'spremises by an employee of the depositary bank. Accordingly, the Boardproposes to revise this section of the Commentary to make these clarifications.<T3>Fees for withdrawals. </T3>The Commentary to andSection; 229.10(c) prohibitsa depositary bank from imposing a fee on a customer when the customer withdrawsfunds that must be made available under the regulation, but for which thebank has not yet received credit. The Board intended this provision toprevent practices designed to discourage customers from exercising theirright to withdraw these funds in accordance with the regulation.Banks have expressed concern, however, that this provision could be interpretedto prohibit the application of account analysis programs commonly usedby banks under which interest or earnings credits are computed on the basisof collected balances. The Board believes that such programs are generallyadopted for legitimate purposes and not for purposes of evading the requirementsof the Act. Because of the difficulties in distinguishing these programsfrom devices to evade the requirements of the Act, the Board proposes todelete this provision of the Commentary. The Board, however, plans to monitorthe practices of banks in this area, and may consider specific restrictionsif it determines that abuses are occurring.<T3>Special deposit slips.</T3> The regulation permits depositary banksto require the use of special deposit slips as a condition to providingnext-day availability for certain types of checks. Banks imposing thisrequirement must make the slips reasonably available to their customers.The Commentary states that if a bank only provides the special depositslips upon the request of a customer, the bank's tellers must advise depositorsof the special slips' availability. Since the publication of the finalrule, a number of banks have stated that this requirement places a difficultburden on tellers. The Board proposes to amend this portion of the Commentaryby deleting the reference to the teller's duties.Section 229.11 Temporary availability schedule.(c) <T3>Nonlocal checks.</T3> Under the temporary schedule, funds depositedby nonlocal check must be made available for withdrawal no later than theseventh business day following the banking day of deposit. There are exceptionsfor deposits in accounts of banks located outside the 48 contiguous statesand for deposits made to nonproprietary ATMs. The Board proposes to deletethe reference to nonproprietary ATM deposits because andSection; 229.11(d)already requires that all checks deposited at nonproprietary ATMs be madeavailable no later than the seventh business day following the bankingday of deposit.Section 229.13 Exceptions.(b) <T3>Large deposits.</T3> This provision permits a depositary bank to extendthe hold placed on local and nonlocal check deposits to the extent thatthe aggregate amount of the deposit on any banking day exceeds $5,000.Since the final rule was adopted, several banks have asked if there isany rule that applies when a large-dollar deposit is made up of both localand nonlocal checks to determine which checks or portions of checks shouldbe made available in accordance with the schedule and which checks maybe held for a longer period of time under this exception. The Board intendedto leave this determination to the discretion of the depositary bank, andproposes to amend the Commentary to clarify this point.(e)(2) <T3>Overdraft and returned check fees.</T3> The last sentence of this paragraphof the regulation states that ``[t]he overdraft and returned check noticemust state that the customer may be entitled to a refund of overdraft orreturned check fees * * *.'' This sentence, when read with the notice requirementof andSection; 229.13(g), could be interpreted to require banks to provideduplicate notices to their customers in certain cases. Thus, the Boardproposes to amend the last sentence of this paragraph to clarify that onlyone notice is required.Section 229.16 Specific availability policy disclosure.The Board proposes to clarify two disclosure issues that have been raisedsince Regulation CC took effect. These clarifications would not requirebanks to change disclosures that have already been printed or mailed.(a) <T3>General.</T3> The Board proposes two revisions to the Commentary toandSection; 229.16(a). First, the Board would clarify that if a bank disclosesthe policy it follows in most cases, it need not disclose to some customersthat they may get faster availability. In addition, the Board would clarifythat a bank does not violate the disclosure requirements of the regulationif it pays checks written on an account prior to the day funds in the accountbecome available for withdrawal according to its disclosure. As long asfunds are not available for withdrawal for all uses permitted to the customers,they are not ``available for withdrawal'' as that term is defined in theregulation and, generally, disclosures based on the time that funds areavailable for all uses are proper.(b) <T3>Content of specific availability policy disclosure. </T3>The Boardalso proposes a revision to the Commentary to andSection; 229.16(b) to clarifythat a bank that provides availability based on when the bank generallyreceives credit for deposited checks need not disclose the time when acheck drawn on each bank will be available for withdrawal. Instead, thebank may disclose the categories of deposits that must be available onthe first business day after the day of deposit, state the other categoriesof deposits and the time periods that will be applicable to those deposits,and state that the customer may request a copy of the bank's schedule forwhen deposits of those checks will be available for withdrawal.(c)(3) <T3>Overdraft and returned check fees. </T3>The last sentence of this paragraphof the regulation states that ``[t]he overdraft and returned check noticemust state that the customer may be entitled to a refund of overdraft orreturned check fees * * *.'' This sentence, when read with the notice requirementin andSection; 229.16(c)(2), could be interpreted to require banks to provideduplicate notices to their customers in certain cases. The Board proposesto amend the last sentence of this paragraph to read ``[t]he notice muststate that the customer may be entitled to a refund of overdraft or returnedcheck fees * * *.''Section 229.19 Miscellaneous.(a) <T3>When funds are considered deposited. </T3>This paragraph establishesrules to determine when funds are considered received in various circumstances.Rules applicable to deposits made at staffed teller stations differ fromthose that apply to deposits made at off-premises facilities, such as lockboxes or night depositories. The Board believes that the rule for whenfunds deposited in a deposit box located in the lobby of the bank shouldbe similar to the rule for funds received at a staffed teller station,and proposes to amend the Commentary accordingly.Section 229.19(a)(5)(ii) permits a bank to establish a cut-off hour of2:00 p.m. or later, after which deposits may be considered made on thefollowing banking day. This provision is similar to U.C.C. andSection; 4-107.Recognizing that many banks close before 2:00 p.m., the Commentary notesthat this provision does not require banks to stay open until 2:00 p.m.The language in the Commentary has raised a number of questions, e.g.,what is the effect of closing most of the bank but leaving drive-up tellerwindows open? The Board proposes to amend the Commentary to clarify theeffect of closing practices on cut-off hours.(e) <T3>Holds on other funds. </T3>Section 229.19(e) of the regulation limitsthe hold a depositary bank may place on any funds of the customer due toa deposit to an account covered by the regulation. For example, for depositsmade to a customer's checking account, if a bank places a hold on fundsin a nontransaction account, such as certain savings accounts, rather thanthe customer's checking account, the bank may place such a hold only tothe extent that the funds held do not exceed the amount of the deposit,and the length of the hold does not exceed the time periods permitted bythe regulation. This restriction is intended to prevent evasion of a principalpurpose of the Act, i.e, to limit holds on deposits to transaction accounts.The regulation also limits holds that a bank can place on funds of thecustomer if the customer cashes a check over the counter to holds thatdo not exceed the time periods prescribed in the regulation and do notexceed the amount of the check cashed. A number of banks have argued that,as to checks cashed over the counter, this restriction is overly broadbecause cashing a check over the counter and placing a hold on a nontransactionaccount does not involve an ``account'' covered by the Act.The Board proposes to amend andSection; 229.19(e) so that, in the case ofchecks cashed over the counter, the regulation does not limit holds placedon funds that are not held in accounts as defined by the regulation.Section 229.20 Relation to State law.The Act (section 608, 12 U.S.C. 4007) provides that any state law in effecton or before September 1, 1989, that provides for a shorter hold for acategory of checks than is provided under federal law will supersede thefederal provision. Section 229.20 of the regulation provides for Boarddeterminations, upon request, of whether state law relating to the availabilityof funds is preempted by federal law and also provides certain preemptionstandards.In August 1988 and October 1988, the Board adopted preemption determinationswith respect to the laws of several states. See, for example, 53 FR 32359(August 24, 1988). In formulating those preemption determinations, theBoard adopted certain uniform principles that will apply in all Board preemptiondeterminations. The Board proposes to amend the Commentary to andSection;229.20 of Regulation CC to incorporate these principles for preemptiondeterminations.Section 229.30 Paying bank's responsibility for return of checks.(a) <T3>Return of checks. </T3>Prior to the effective date of Regulation CC,a paying bank usually returned a check to the presenting bank and automaticallyreceived a refund of any provisional settlement it may have made. UnderRegulation CC, the paying bank must make an expeditious return, which mayor may not involve returning the check through the presenting bank. Ifthe paying bank does not return through the presenting bank, it will receivepayment for the check from the bank to which the check is returned (a returningbank or the depositary bank). In these cases, any credit given to the presentingbank is not charged back.In rare cases, a paying bank that returns a check may not have settledfor the check with the presenting bank. In such cases, if the paying bankreturns the check other than through the presenting bank, it should berequired to make immediate payment for the amount of the check to the presentingbank. The Board proposes to amend the Commentary to andSection; 229.30(a)to clarify this point.(b) <T3>Unidentifiable depositary bank. </T3>If a paying bank is unable toidentify the depositary bank, it may return the check to any bank thathandled the check for forward collection, even if that bank has not agreedto act as a returning bank. If a paying bank chooses this option, it mustadvise the collecting bank that it is unable to identify the depositarybank. The Board proposes to amend the Commentary to provide that this noticemust be conspicuous, and that the paying bank may not prepare the checkfor automated processing.Section 229.31 Returning bank's responsibility for return of checks.(b) <T3>Unidentifiable depositary bank. </T3>This paragraph provides, amongother things, that a returning bank that receives a check from a payingbank that could not identify the depositary bank must return the checkexpeditiously to the depositary bank if it is able to identify the depositarybank. The Board proposes to amend the regulation to clarify that this requirementalso applies to checks that a returning bank receives from another returningbank where the prior returning bank is not able to identify the depositarybank.(f) <T3>Notice in lieu of return. </T3>This paragraph provides that a returningbank may send a notice of nonpayment in lieu of the physical check if thecheck is lost or otherwise unavailable. The Board does not believe thata check is unavailable merely because a bank has filed it in a way thatmakes its retrieval inconvenient or difficult. Notice in lieu of the returnof the actual check should be permitted only when a bank does not haveand cannot obtain possession of the check or must retain possession ofthe check for protest. The Board proposes an amendment to the Commentaryto clarify this point.Section 229.32 (Depositary bank's responsibility for returned checks.Under andSection; 229.32(a)(2), a depositary bank must accept returned checksat a location consistent with the name and address of the depositary bankin its indorsement on the check, or, if no address appears in the indorsement,at a branch or head office associated with the routing number of the depositarybank in its indorsement. A depositary bank's indorsement could containan address that is in a different check processing region from an addressassociated with the routing number in the indorsement. As returned checkswill be routed on the basis of the routing number in the depositary bank'sindorsement, the return of checks will be facilitated if returns can bemade to an address in the same check processing region as the locationassociated with the routing number. Therefore, the Board proposes to amendandSection; 229.32(a)(2) to provide that if the address in the depositarybank's indorsement is not in the same check processing region as the addressassociated with the routing number in its indorsement, the depositary bankmust accept returned checks at a branch or head office associated withthe routing number in the indorsement.Section 229.32(a) also permits depositary banks to require that returnedchecks be sorted separately from forward collection checks. The intentof this provision is to require paying or returning banks to present returnedchecks to the depositary bank separately sorted from forward collectionchecks, unless the depositary bank agrees to take returned checks commingledwith forward collection checks. The Board proposes to clarify the regulationand the Commentary on this point.Similarly, the Board also proposes to amend andSection; 229.32 to state thata depositary bank may require returned checks for which it is the depositarybank to be separately sorted from checks for which it is a returning bank,including those for which it is a prior indorser. This amendment wouldfacilitate the handling of checks that are returned to prior indorsersbecause of difficulty in identifying the depositary bank.Section 229.33 Notice of nonpayment.(a) <T3>Requirement. </T3>A paying bank's failure to give notice of nonpaymentmay be offset by a depositary bank's breach of warranty of title or otherwarranty regarding a check. The Board believes that a paying bank shouldnot be responsible to a depositary bank for failure to give notice in acase where the depositary bank has breached its warranty, such as wherethe check has been stolen. This is consistent with the Uniform CommercialCode's allocation of loss for the late return of a check in such a case.See U.C.C. andSection; 4-032; see also <T3>First American Savings </T3>v. <T3>M andamp; I Bank, </T3>685 F. Supp. 473 (E.D. Pa. 1988); 50 FR 5739-40(Feb. 12, 1985). The Commentary to this section has been revised to clarifythe notice of nonpayment requirement in such cases.Section 229.35 Indorsements(a) <T3>Indorsement standards. </T3>The indorsement standard specifies theinformation that must be included in a depositary bank's indorsement. Thestandard also permits depositary banks to include other identifying informationin their indorsements. Some banks have included nine-digit ZIP codes intheir indorsements. The Board believes that the inclusion of the nine-digitZIP code could lead paying and returning banks to confuse the ZIP codewith the routing number, which also contains nine digits. In order to preventthis confusion, the Board proposes to amend the Commentary to advise depositarybanks not to include in their indorsements information, such as a nine-digitZIP code, that could be confused with required information, such as thedepositary bank's routing number.(b) <T3>Liability of bank handling check. </T3>This paragraph provides thata bank handling a check for collection or return may have the rights ofa holder. The Board proposes to revise the Commentary to clarify that abank may become a holder or a holder in due course regardless of whetherprior banks have complied with the regulation's indorsement standards.Section 229.37 Variation by agreement.The Commentary to this section notes that the Board did not adopt the rulestated in U.C.C. section 4-103(2), which provides that Federal Reserveregulations and operating letters, clearinghouse rules, and the like havethe effect of agreements under the U.C.C. that apply to parties that havenot specifically assented to them. The Board did not, however, intend toaffect the status of such agreements under the U.C.C., and the Board accordinglyproposes to clarify this point in the Commentary.Appendix A_Routing Number Guide to Next-Day Availability Checks and LocalChecksThe Board proposes to update the list of Federal Home Loan Bank routingnumbers to include a newly-issued routing number of the Houston Branchof the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas.<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous Amendments</ITAG>In a related action today (Docket No. R-0648), the Board is proposing anumber of substantive amendments to Regulation CC to alleviate the problemsassociated with treating checks payable by one bank but payable throughanother as local or nonlocal based on the location of the bank by whichthey are payable. Several other technical amendments are also necessaryto accommodate cases where a check is payable by one bank but payable throughanother; these include amendments to andSection; 229.34 (Warranties by payingbank and returning bank) and andSection; 229.38 (Liability) to clarify thatin cases of payable through drafts payable by a bank, the bank by whichthe check is payable, not the payable through bank, makes the paying bank'swarranties or is liable for the condition of the back of a check. Theseproposed technical amendments related to payable through checks are includedin this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis</ITAG>These proposals are primarily clarifications to Regulation CC that theBoard is proposing in response to questions and requests for clarificationthat the Board has received since the final rule was adopted.

Thus,a bank need not disclose to some customers that they receive faster availabilitythan indicated in the disclosure.

Further, as andSection; 229.2(f) definesthe term ``banking day'' as the portion of a business day on which a bankis open to the public for substantially all of its banking functions, aday, or a portion of a day, is not necessarily a banking day merely becausethe bank is open for only limited functions, such as keeping drive-in orwalk-up teller windows open, when the rest of the bank is closed to thepublic. For example, a banking office that usually provides a full rangeof banking services may close at 12:00 noon but leave a drive-in tellerwindow open for the limited purpose of receiving deposits and making cashwithdrawals. Under those circumstances, the bank is considered closed andmay consider deposits received after 12:00 noon as having been receivedon the next banking day. The fact that a bank may reopen for substantiallyall of its banking functions after 2:00 p.m., or that it continues itsback office operations throughout the day, would not affect this result.A bank may not, however, close individual teller stations and reopen themfor next-day's business before 2:00 p.m. during a banking day.</ITAG>h. The Commentary to andSection; 229.19(e) is amended by revising the secondparagraph and adding a third paragraph to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(e) <T3>Holds on other funds. </T3>* * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This paragraph clarifies that, if a customer deposits a check in anaccount (as defined in andSection;229.2(a)), the bank may not place a holdon any of the customer's funds so that the funds that are held exceed theamount of the check deposited, or the total amount of funds held are notmade available for withdrawal within the times required in this subpart.For example, if a bank places a hold on funds in a customer's nontransactionaccount, rather than a transaction account, for deposits made to the customer'stransaction account, the bank may place such a hold only to the extentthat the funds held do not exceed the amount of the deposit, and the lengthof the hold does not exceed the time periods permitted by this regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These restrictions also apply to holds placed on funds in a customer'saccount (as defined in andSection;229.2(a)), if a customer cashes a check(other than an ``on us'' check) over the counter. The regulation does notprohibit holds that may be placed on other funds of the customer for checkscashed over the counter, to the extent that the transaction does not involvea deposit to an account.</ITAG>i. The Commentary to andSection;229.20(c) is revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="73">Section 229.20 Relation to State Law </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) <T3>Standards for preemption. </T3>This section describes the standardsthe Board will use in making determinations on whether federal law willpreempt state laws governing funds availability. A provision of state lawis considered inconsistent with federal law if it permits a depositarybank to make funds available to a customer in a longer period of time thanthe maximum period permitted by the Act and this regulation. For example,a state law that permits a hold of four business days or longer for localchecks permits a hold that is longer than that permitted under the Actand this regulation, and therefore is inconsistent and preempted. Stateavailability schedules that provide for availability in a shorter periodof time than required under Regulation CC supersede the federal schedule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under a state law, some categories of deposits could be availablefor withdrawal sooner or later than the time required by this subpart,depending on the composition of the deposit. For example, the Act and thisregulation (andSection;229.10(c)(1)(vii)) require next-day availability forthe first $100 of the aggregate deposit of local or nonlocal checks onany day, and a state law could require next-day availability for any checkof $100 or less that is deposited. Under the Act, if either one $150 checkor three $50 checks are deposited on a given day, $100 must be made availablefor withdrawal on the next business day, and $50 must be made availablein accordance with the local or nonlocal schedule. Under the state law,however, the two deposits would be subject to different availability rules.In the first case, none of the proceeds of the deposit would be subjectto next-day availability; in the second case, the entire proceeds of thedeposit would be subject to next-day availability. In this example, becausethe state law would, in some situations, permit a hold longer than themaximum permitted by the Act, this provision of state law is inconsistentand preempted in its entirety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition to the differences between state and federal availabilityschedules, a number of state laws contain exceptions to the state availabilityschedules that are different from those provided under the Act and thisregulation. The state exceptions continue to apply only in those caseswhere the state schedule is shorter than or equal to the federal schedule,and then only up to the limit permitted by the Regulation CC schedule.Where a deposit is subject to a state exception under a state schedulethat is not preempted by Regulation CC and is also subject to a federalexception, the hold on the deposit cannot exceed the hold permissible underthe federal exception in accordance with Regulation CC. In such cases,only one exception notice is required, in accordance with andSection;229.13(g).This notice need only include the applicable federal exception as the reasonthe exception was invoked. For those categories of checks for which thestate schedule is preempted by the federal schedule, only the federal exceptionsmay be used. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">State law that provide maximum availability periods for categoriesof deposits that are not covered by the Act would not be preempted. Thus,state funds availability law that apply to funds in time and savings depositsare not affected by the Act or this regulation. In addition, the availabilityschedules of several states apply to ``items'' deposited to an account.The term ``items'' may encompass deposits, such as nonnegotiable instruments,that are not subject to the Regulation CC availability schedules. Depositsthat are not covered by Regulation CC continue to be subject to the stateavailability schedules. State laws that provide maximum availability periodsfor categories of institutions that are not covered by the Act would alsonot be preempted. For example, a state law that governs money market mutualfunds would not be affected by the Act or this regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Generally, state rules governing the disclosure or notice of availabilitypolicies applicable to accounts are also preempted, if they are differentfrom the federal rules. Nevertheless, a state law requiring disclosureof funds availability policies that apply to deposits other than ``accounts,''such as savings or time deposits, are not inconsistent with the Act andthis subpart. Banks in these states would have to follow the state disclosurerules for these deposits. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>Section 229.30 [Amended] j.
