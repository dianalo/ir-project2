As the fundamental cross sectionlibrary the Joint Evaluated File JEF-1 was used, the processing of thesedata to group constants was performed with the Karlsruhe version of theprocessing system NJOY. Most of the irregularities occur for high concentrationof the nuclide in question, especially in the unresolved resonance region.The irregularities are discussed in some detail and possible reasonsfor their occurrence are given. This investigation is done for all groupcross sections of the heavy nuclei (U-232, -234, -235, -236, -238, Pu-238,-239, -240, -241, -242, Am-241, -243), structural materials, oxygen,boron, and hydrogen bound in water. All irregularities are removed, partlyformally. The application of this new group constant library to the analysisof the PWR-fuel cycle will be described in another paper.</TEXT></DOC>
