(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Relief flooded over the family ofAmerican hostage Joseph Cicippio this afternoon as word came thatan execution order already given two reprieves had been suspendedby his kidnappers in Lebanon.   ``This gives them much more time to get together and get thisthing worked out,'' said Thomas Cicippio, brother of the hostage,outside his home where family members had gathered when theexecution order was announced.   ``This is what we were looking forward to,'' Thomas Cicippiosaid. ``Of course, we are all very happy.''   The suspension of the execution came after a four-hour reprievewas granted this morning, following a 48-hour reprieve on Tuesday.   ``This means that perhaps there is something in the making _maybe to our liking _ and they need a little more time to resolvewhatever is going on,'' Thomas Cicippio said when the four-hourreprieve was announced.   The Cicippio family then went to nearby Holy Savior CatholicChurch, where hourly masses were held today for all the hostages asthe fate of the Pennsylvania native remained in the balance.   Thomas Cicippio expressed hope that Iran and its new president,Hashemi Rafsanjani, were behind the reprieves.   ``I have a lot of faith in Rafsanjani,'' Thomas Cicippio said.``I fully believe that Rafsanjani and Iran holds the key to thehostage issue.''   He said he believes Rafsanjani understands resolution of thecrisis could improve relations between Iran and other countries.   When the family first heard audio tapes of the hostage'srecorded plea with Israel to release a Moslem cleric it holds, thehostage's son, David, 27, couldn't believe it was Cicippio. Butwhen the video was added and the tape replayed on television, hewas convinced.   ``It's the first time I've heard his voice in three years. Ican't explain how I feel right now,'' said David Cicippio.   Both son and brother said it was obvious Cicippio was readingfrom a prepared text.   Thomas Cicippio has been keeping track of the captivity of allAmerican hostages on signs in his front yard.   On Wednesday night, he walked across his rain-soaked lawn,ignoring the clattering cameras of the media, and silently addedanother day.   The totals: Edward Tracy, 1,018; Tom Sutherland, 1,517; U.S.Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, 534; Joseph Cicippio, 1,057;Robert Pohill, Alann Steen and Jesse Turner, 923; Terry Anderson,1,602; and Frank Reed, 1,060.   Back inside the Cicippio home, he spoke of the strain the familyhas faced as they await news of Joseph Cicippio, whose captors, theRevolutionary Justice Organization, had threatened to kill him at11 a.m. EDT today.   His kidnappers extended the deadline today to 3 p.m. EDT afterJoseph Cicippio appealed for the immediate release of a ShiiteMoslem cleric held in Israel.   Cicippio's appeal and the announcement of the reprieve were madein a videotape released to a Western news agency in Beirut by theRevolutionary Justice Organization.   The death threat _ orginally set for Tuesday _ is in retaliationfor Israel's refusal to free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a ShiiteMoslem religious leader kidnapped by Israeli commandos last week.   ``It's been hectic,'' Thomas Cicippio said late Wednesday. Buttoday ``will be the most hectic day of all.''   Family members had come and gone, leaving Cicippio alone withhis wife, Frances, and Joseph Cicippio's Lebanese brother-in-law,Sami Ghandour, 23, in the family den.   After watching the television news, which featured them, theytalked about how Joseph Cicippio, 58, left his home in thisPhiladelphia suburb to work abroad, how he met his Lebanese wife,Elham, and how much he loved his work as acting comptroller at theAmerican University of Beirut.   He was kidnapped from the campus Sept. 12, 1986.   ``Joe never really felt he was in too much danger. He alwaysfelt safe in that he worked at the American University of Beirut.He just enjoyed being there,'' Thomas Cicippio said.</TEXT></DOC>
