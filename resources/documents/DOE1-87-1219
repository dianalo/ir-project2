Since1973, efficiency has improved 25.8%. Even though collective actions haveresulted in manufacturing cost savings, the ratio of energy cost to manufacturingexpense continues to rise in all sectors. The trend of leading indicatorsaffecting future energy utilization improvements, i.e. production levels,capacity utilizations, and profits, all suggest that incremental gainswill be harder to achieve in the future. In the early years of the program,efficiency gains came from a very broad base of sources, including low-costhouse keeping actions; recent actions also include process improvementsand major plant equipment retrofits. Overall, Canada's record of energyefficiency improvement is lagging behind the performances of other industrializedcountries. 13 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
