SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lightning deaths around the nation last yearrose to the highest level in this decade, and the rate oflightning-related injuries was nearly 50 percent higher than usual,according to new government figures.   Twice in 1987 lightning claimed three lives with a single bolt _in New York and Tennessee, the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration reported Monday.   One Maine youth wasn't even safe at home, in bed and under thecovers. On July 31 a bolt struck his home in Nantucket County,traveled down a wall and knocked the 19-year-old out of bed.   That youth was among 365 people hurt during the year, well abovethe 250 annual average. Eighty-six were killed _ the most since 88died in 1978.   But the total was still short of the annual average of 96deaths. Lightning deaths have been declining in recent years,dipping to a record low of 68 fatalities in 1986 before reboundinglast year.   ``Lightning apparently does not command the respect it deservesas a dangerous killer,'' E. W. Friday, director of the NationalWeather Service, warned in a statement. Among weather-relatedhazards, only flash floods kill more people annually thanlightning, he said.   Three golfers taking shelter under a tall tree on a hill werekilled July 3 at Warrior's Path State Park near Kingsport, Tenn.   And on July 26, lightning killed three campers sleeping in tentsat Darien Lake in Genesee County, N.Y. Scorch marks indicated thatthe bolt first struck the aluminum pole of one tent, killing itstwo occupants, then jumped six feet to another tent andelectrocuted the third person.   On the same day a 28-year-old man was killed and three othersinjured at Lake Russell, Ga., when struck while in a tent locatednear a tall tree.   And just four days later a similar instance injured but sparedthe lives of three campers in New York state. Three girls were in atent in New Scotland, in Albany County, when a bolt struck a nearbytree and traveled through the root system to their tent where itmelted a sleeping bag and left all three with burns.   A father and son camping in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area inLake County, Minn., were killed July 24 when lightning hit a whitepine 20 feet from their tent. Two other people were burned.   Last year's high injury list included instances in which astrike injured a group of people.   Some 30 people in Chicago Heights, Ill., were injured in asingle strike July 29, for example, when lightning hit a tree andthen bounced to a metal gate where people were leaving a ball game.Some people were knocked four or five feet and two were seriouslyinjured.   In another case, on Aug. 12, 24 were injured in Silver City,N.M., when a bolt hit a high school football field near a group ofplayers. The injuries, which included 18 football players, weremostly minor burns.   Seven people sitting under a tree in Green County, Ohio wereinjured by a lightning strike July 11.   A half-dozen national guardsmen were injured Aug. 4 when a boltstruck during a night exercise at Fort McClellan, Ala., while onJuly 24 five Coast Guardsmen standing on a seawall at Port Huron,Mich., were injured by a bolt.   Overall, nearly one-third of the people injured were affected byjust nine strikes.   As usual, Florida led the nation with 11 lightning deaths lastyear. Tennessee ranked second with 6, followed by 5 in New Mexicoand 4 each in Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Yorkand North Carolina.   Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey,Oklahoma and South Carolina each recorded three fatalities. Therewere two each in Arizona, Kentucky, Missouri, Utah and Virginia.Recording a single lightning death for the year were Washington,D.C.; Kansas, Montana, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and South Dakota.   In addition to deaths and injuries, extensive property damagewas caused by lightning each year. For example, lightning strikeskindled more than 900 fires in Oregon last August, laying waste to130,000 acres of forest land in the worst fire since the so-calledTelbrook Burn in 1921.   A lightning strike doesn't always mean a fire, though. On July 1a bolt ruptured the Salem, S.C., water tower, causing a spill of100,000 gallons.</TEXT></DOC>
