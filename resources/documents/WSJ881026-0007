The New Jersey State Department of Environmental Protection rejected the company's request on the ground that the plant may contribute to &quot;an already serious and unacceptable level of environmental degradation.&quot;    Ciba-Geigy based in Ardsley, N.Y., said it is &quot;disappointed with the decision&quot; and is studying all its options, including an appeal.    &quot;This (permit) decision followed a very lengthy, very public process. This is like election day&quot; to Ciba-Geigy, said John R. Weingart, director of the state's division of coastal resources. He noted that part of the reason for the denial was because &quot;adding a new industial complex to the site would make it harder to detect and clean up&quot; existing problems.    The proposed plant is part of a broad restructuring of the 1,400-square-acre Toms River works that involves phasing out dye and plastics operations and replacing them with the new pharmaceuticals plant. The Toms River operation currently employs 650 workers, 250 of whom will lose their jobs after the phase-out, the company said. The proposed pharmaceuticals plant would ultimately create 120 jobs, it added.    The company is currently involved in litigation stemming from two state grand-jury indictments charging it with unlawful disposal of waste. The company has pleaded innocent to the charges. The Toms River operation caused a furor in 1984, when hazardous waste seeped into ground water in a nearby residential area.    Another rallying point for environmentalists over the years has been a pipeline the company uses to discharge treated waste water into the Atlantic Ocean. Ciba-Geigy, a unit of Ciba-Geigy AG, of Switzerland, is the only industrial concern in New Jersey permitted to use such a pipeline. </TEXT></DOC>
