Not that the quality of people in the field is declining or even that too little money is being spent. What Dr. DeBakey worries about is that animal-rights groups are dangerously close to pricing many important medical-research projects out of existence.    Scientists on the cutting edge of the biotechnology revolution are encountering similar opposition. An experiment to test the frost-fighting abilities of genetically engineered bacteria was disrupted in California recently when vandals uprooted 2,000 of the test's 2,400 strawberry plants.    Together, these issues raise the question of whether the U.S. will continue to be a world leader in scientific progress, or whether groups of neo-Luddites will be able to impede that process under false theories of environmental concern and the &quot;rights&quot; of nature. If these groups succeed in raising significant political barriers to U.S. science, the scientists will take their research and its benefits overseas. Some already have.    Many animal-rights activists say they only want lab animals treated humanely, and they already have persuaded six states to bar the use of pound animals in medical research. But others believe it is immoral to kill any living thing and their tactics range from &quot;freeing&quot; animals housed in laboratories to breaking into facilities and stealing records. The costs of these attacks combined with the fear of legal and illegal harassment already have slowed or stopped important medical-research projects.    More recently, similar groups have expanded their efforts to assault genetic engineering, using the technology's newness as a weapon. By raising &quot;fears&quot; and staging melodramatic demonstrations, the anti-biotech agitators have managed to attract media attention to arguments that scientifically are quite weak.    The latest effort to curtail animal research is a bill introduced by Rep. Robert Mrazek (D., N.Y.), which would ban the use of pound animals for any research funded by the National Institutes of Health. Unnecessary abuses in the treatment of laboratory animals probably do occur occasionally. But the irony in Rep. Mrazek's proposal, which would require the use of expensive laboratory-bred animals, is that it won't save a single animal. Rather, more animal deaths seem likely to occur.    Pounds and shelters take in seven million abandoned dogs every year, five million of which have to be killed. Why is it more moral to let them die in a pound instead of in a laboratory where they may advance medical knowledge? After all, humans are not the only beneficiaries of laboratory research. Today millions of pets can be treated for heart disease, leukemia or kidney failure solely as a result of experiments based on animal research. Some animal-rights activists can't seem to remember that.    Dr. DeBakey tells of the time when he testified before Congress against a bill requiring federal animal-welfare standards. Helen Stevens, a leading animal-rights activist, came up to him to say how much his medical breakthroughs had meant to her husband, Roger Stevens, head of the Kennedy Center in Washington. Mr. Stevens had successfully undergone a coronary-bypass operation. &quot;I thanked her, but said the research that saved her husband's life would not have been possible without the ready availability of animals for medical research,&quot; recalls Dr. DeBakey. &quot;Mrs. Stevens became a little flustered and ended the conversation.&quot;    Many of us now take for granted the medical breakthroughs that have made living into one's later years something to look forward to. Smallpox, diphtheria, whooping cough and polio are all scourges that are under control, but which might not be without the benefits of medical research on animals. The biotechnology research being conducted now on agricultural plants in California is only the initial point of a process of discovery that could benefit not only people living in the relative affluence of the West but in poor countries as well.    There well may be small but highly vocal groups of individuals in the West who've decided that life is as good as it's going to get and that the scientific frontier is a fearful and dangerous place. While their expressions of concern sometimes have a superficial populist appeal, it is important that the rest of the public attempts to inform itself about the purposes of modern scientific endeavor. Not knowing what science is doing makes it more likely that the no-nothings will retard the delivery of science's benefits to man. </TEXT></DOC>
