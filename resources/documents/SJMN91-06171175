He hasstrength for a period of time, and then under pressure from other forces, hemay change his decision. That isn't a good thing.&quot;;    Yeltsin, speakingthrough an interpreter, criticized Gorbachev for what he called the Sovietleader's &quot;half-hearted decisions, changing his position, he goes first to theright, then to the left. These perhaps are the main qualities which I don'tlike about him.&quot;;    Recently, however, after being warned that continuedmilitary crackdown in the Baltics and a retreat from the reforms he startedwould lead to demands for his resignation, Gorbachev realigned himself withthe reformers, Yeltsin said.;    &quot;Since then, I would call our relationsbalanced . . . pragmatic,&quot; the Russian populist said. &quot;There's nothingpersonal in this at all.&quot;;    Gorbachev brought Yeltsin into the top ranks ofthe Communist Party and then fired him three years ago after he complainedthat Gorbachev was moving too slowly on reform.;    Yeltsin's primary messageon this first day of his four-day unofficial visit to the United States was todeclare Russia open for business.;    As leader of the largest and wealthiestof the Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics, Yeltsin said, he did not cometo beg.;    &quot;We have not come here hat in hand,&quot; Yeltsin said. &quot;We have comehere to . . . assure you we are working for a better future, one which weshall build with our own hands.;    &quot;We shall travel your road&quot; toward amarket economy and a free enterprise system, the outspoken ex-communist toldhis first audience at the start of the visit. &quot;We believe that we have leftbehind the experiment that we had to go through, the one which was calledMarxism.&quot;;    Yeltsin said the Russian parliament will adopt legislation thismonth to open the republic to foreign investment.;    &quot;It will create abeneficial regime for all investors from all over the world to come and set uptheir enterprises in the Soviet Union, to own them and manage them as they seefit,&quot; he said. &quot;And we want them to make a profit, and we believe the peopleof Russia will benefit because of that.&quot;;    The blunt-spoken Yeltsin at firstappeared sensitive to U.S. concerns that his visit might embarrass Gorbachev,who has the support of the Bush administration.;    He said his dramaticelection victory over five other candidates last week was made possible by thereforms Gorbachev launched six years ago. And he said Gorbachev had returnedto the democratic path after a dark winter when dictatorship threatened toreplace the fledgling Soviet democracy.;    The administration, wary ofYeltsin using his visit to challenge Gorbachev's leadership of the centralgovernment, was being careful not to make too much of a fuss over him.;   Yeltsin landed at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., outside Washington and waswelcomed by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, who with his Democraticcounterpart, Sen. George J. Mitchell of Maine, are acting as hosts for thevisit to Washington and New York.;    Deputy Assistant Secretary of StateCurtis Kamman was in the greeting party, but one U.S. official said privatelyno higher-ranking member of the administration was on hand because &quot;it's aprivate visit from the executive branch's point of view.&quot;;    White Housepress secretary Marlin Fitzwater noted that Bush, who is scheduled to seeYeltsin on Thursday, &quot;has met with the presidents of the other republics, aswell as the Baltic states, and we certainly are anxious to meet with PresidentYeltsin as well.&quot;;    But he added, &quot;Our relationship has been with thecentral government of the Soviet Union for the last 40-some years, and that'sthe way it will remain.&quot;;    Diplomatic relations with the Soviet Unionactually were established in 1933.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910619  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  737  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday June 19, 199100171175,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
