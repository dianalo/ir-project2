In the paper the notion of the spectral shiftfunction is generalized in an appropriate manner such that the shiftis summable and satisfies a modified trace formula. Moreover, a modificationof the Birman-Krein formula is established. All results are transformedto a pair of maximal dissipative operators whose resolvent differencebelongs to the trace class. 23 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
