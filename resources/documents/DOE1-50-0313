<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-50-0313 </DOCNO><TEXT>Two large plastic scintillators are described, a 1 m square detector with2 dimensional position sensitivity and a 1.8x0.2 m detector with positionsensitivity along its length. Both scintillators are 0.1 m thick. Measurementsof pulse height, timing and position resolution, performed using cosmicrays, are presented and the experimental pulse height response is comparedwith the predictions of Monte Carlo calculations.</TEXT></DOC>
