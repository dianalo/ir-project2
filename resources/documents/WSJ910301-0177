I am the &quot;victorious&quot;defendant in this case. I am a full-time research professorof the New York University School of Medicine and the unpaideditor of the small, international Journal of MedicalPrimatology. My legal expenses so far are well over $1million. The seven years of time and effort spent on mydefense have forced me to curtail greatly my research,teaching and publishing activities. The plaintiff, ImmunoAktiengesellschaft, is a multinational, Austrian-basedpharmaceutical company for which the suit is a pretaxbusiness expense. No wonder I am the only remaining defendantin this case.   In the words of the Appellate Division, First Department,Immuno AG &quot;succeeded in coercing what the motion courtreferred to in its decision as `substantial settlements' fromall but one of the original defendants {myself} for theobvious reason that costs of continuing to defend the actionwere prohibitive.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The decision of the New York State Court of Appeals in myfavor may still not effectively deter the plaintiff in mycase (which boasted in the Austrian press of suing&quot;innumerable&quot; parties for libel), or other wealthy partiesinterested in muzzling public criticism of their activities,from using the legal system to wear out the financial andmoral stamina of their critics.   To my knowledge, the suit against my magazine was thefirst suit filed for a scientific debate, basically on anenvironmental issue (i.e. use of wild chimpanzees, anendangered species, for infectious medical studies inAfrica), in a scientific journal. I am afraid it may not bethe last, considering the cost-effectiveness of havingsilenced all the other defendants.   Had the tobacco and asbestos companies sued for the firsttentative discussions in scientific journals of thecorrelation of their products with cancer, the public mighthave been deprived of the knowledge of the health hazardsthat we understand today. What we need now is a legaldeterrent for prohibitively costly, meritless libel suitsthat misuse our court system to undermine the protection weshould enjoy under the First Amendment.   J.
