The discovery, in which British Petroleum Co. is aparticipant, is in 3,100 feet of water 130 miles southeast ofNew Orleans. If the find is developed as a commercial field,it would set a record for deep-water production of oil fromU.S. waters.</LP><TEXT>   A leader in deep-water drilling, Shell has drilledexploratory wells in waters 2 1/2 times as deep as thisdiscovery. But production technology hasn't caught up,although Shell does plan to produce from a water depth of2,860 feet when it opens another Gulf of Mexico field, theAuger, in 1993.   Separately, Marathon Oil Co. announced a &quot;significant newfield discovery&quot; in the Gulf of Mexico. According toMarathon, the well flowed at a stabilized rate of 2,407barrels of oil a day. But the Marathon discovery is inshallower waters, 775 feet deep, some 96 miles southwest ofVenice, La.   The so-called deep-water frontier in the Gulf of Mexicobegins at a depth of 1,500 feet. Shell, a unit of the RoyalDutch/Shell Group, is the largest holder of deep-water leasesin the Gulf of Mexico. Shell is also the operator on theso-called Mars prospect acreage where its latest discoverywas made.   Shell said the Mars discovery well, which is on theMississippi Canyon Block 763, found oil at depths between14,500 and 18,100 feet below the ocean floor. The zones havea combined net thickness of 440 feet of oil-bearing sand, thecompany said.   Shell cautioned, however, that it doesn't have enoughinformation to decide whether its prospect can beeconomically developed. Still, the company said it hasdrilled four wells and that a fifth is being drilled on theprospect acreage, which is on Mississipi Canyon Blocks 763and 807.   Specific results of the individual wells weren'tdisclosed. But Shell called the discovery &quot;potentiallysignificant.&quot; Frank H. Richardson, Shell president, said thecompany's &quot;Mars discovery is potentially large and couldsurpass in estimated volumes our Auger deep-water discoveryannounced in 1989.&quot;   The Auger discovery is 214 miles southwest of New Orleans.Expected to cost $1.3 billion to develop, that field isscheduled to produce 40,000 barrels of oil a day at the peak.   BP Exploration, a unit of British Petroleum, noted that itis Shell's sole partner in the Mars project. The Mars is&quot;potentially the largest prospect in which the company hasparticipated since the discovery of its major North Seafields,&quot; BP Exploration said.   According to its agreement with Shell, BP said it can earnas much as a one-third interest in the field. A spokesmansaid one factor determining BP's share will be the size ofthe oil reserves.   If the decision is made to go ahead, Mars production couldbegin within five years, Shell said.</TEXT></DOC>
