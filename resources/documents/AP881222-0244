The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude, rose 15 cents Wednesday to settle at $16.30 abarrel in New York Mercantile Exchange trading. On Tuesday, thecontract rose 33 cents.   Wednesday's gains in energy futures were ``tremors andaftershocks after the earthquake yesterday,'' said Jim Fiedler, ananalyst with E.D.andamp;F. Man International Futures Inc.   He referred to a $1.42 a barrel gain Tuesday in the expiringJanuary contract for West Texas Intermediate crude. That pushed theJanuary contract to $17.73 a barrel.   Analysts said the January advance was due to technical buying bya trader who was caught short and was forced to buy Januarycontracts to close out a position. The advance lent support totrading Wednesday in contracts for subsequent months, they said.   Peter Beutel, an analyst with Elders Futures Inc., said reportsthat members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countrieswould meet with non-OPEC oil producers also supported prices.   Members of the cartel are hoping the non-OPEC nations will bringtheir production and pricing in line with OPEC's. OPEC members lastmonth agreed to limit their production in the first half of 1989 inorder to boost world crude prices.
