Carcinogenic healthrisks due to those pollutants which are potential carcinogens were estimatedthrough the measurement of ambient concentrations and the developmentand application of an urban air toxics exposure and risk-assessment model.The approach integrates ambient concentration, population distribution,and health-risk data for individual chemical species into regional estimatesof inhalation exposure, risk, and number of excess cancer cases. Theenhanced Human Exposure Model can be used to apportion the estimatednumber of excess cancer cases by source category and by pollutant andto identify high-risk chemical species and source categories. It canalso be applied for the identification of high-risk locations and forthe estimation of control measure effectiveness in reducing exposure,cancer risk and number of excess cancer cases. A linear response relationshipis assumed, and the exposure and risks associated with multiple sourcesand species of air toxics are considered additive. Risks were calculatedonly for inhalation of ambient air throughout a 70-year lifetime.</TEXT></DOC>
