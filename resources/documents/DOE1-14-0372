When constant current charge-discharge was conducted at variouscurrent values, the value, charged current amount minus amount of electricitycorresponding to amount of collected hydrogen, well coincided with thedischarge current amount. Change of open circuit voltage in the charge-dischargestages coincided each other, and changes linearly for the concentrationratio of Cr{sup 2+}/Cr{sup 3+}, and the polarization characteristicsalso changed linearly. As a result of examining the relation of voltageefficiency and Coulomb efficiency, a cell was found to show more thanthe target value of 80% of charge-discharge efficiency which would bevery effective for the study of various factors.
