(Editorial on FTS 2000 communications network) (editorial)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>FTSandM;This time next month, the government will be completing its switch-over toFTS 2000 for basic services.andP;  This is almost a year and a half ahead of theschedule required by the two FTS contracts.andP;  This is good news.andM;ATandamp;T Co. and US Sprint Communications Co. have implemented the voice part ofthe two FTS 2000 systems in roughly half the time contemplated in theircontracts.andP;  The companies had to hurdle a barrier or two, but on the wholethe transition has been quick and easy, so much so that many federal usersnever noticed the changeover.andM;The best thing about the new systems is that they save money for the agenciesand give them more control over long-distance usage and greater ability totrack expenditures.andM;It is true that just about any system would have made improvements in theseareas.andP;  That is why agency officials were so dismayed at the time and troublethe General Services Administration had to go through to get the contractsawarded.andP;  Every day wasted under the old FTS system cost the governmentthousands of dollars.andP;  For that reason the two vendors deserve kudos forgetting so much of their work done so quickly.andM;Of course, the work is far from over, and further hurdles await.andP;  There isthe question of what happens at the four-year mark in the contracts, whenportions of them come up for recompetition.andP;  Everyone must hope GSA doesn'thave to go through the same pain, suffering and congressional interferencethat marked the early FTS 2000 history.andM;And speaking of saving money, it isn't clear that agencies will be able tosave as much money four years from now as they are saving today.andP;  AssuringFTS prices are low vs.andP;  commercial prices will become more difficult overtime.andP;  Large commercial users, not locked into long-term FTS-like contracts,will be able to negotiate better prices than the government enjoys, and thegovernment will have little clout to get the same kinds of deals absent acomplete recompetition.andM;GSA will do its best to motivate ATandamp;T and Sprint to keep their FTS 2000prices low, but GSA doesn't have as much influence in the later years as wewould like it to.andM;Additionally, there is the very important matter of data services under FTS2000.andP;  Many agencies still are not happy with the congressionally mandateduse of FTS for data communications.andP;  Most of them have knuckled under butonly grudgingly.andM;Today, the two vendors have not bridged their data services.andP;  This is coming,and because the bulk of most agencies' data traffic is intra-agency and notinteragency, the current situation is mostly an inconvenience.andM;As the agencies use more data services and as those services become moresophisticated, the true test and the true value of FTS 2000 will becomeclear.andP;  Whether it will pass the test is not known, but given progress todate it is an understatement to say, &quot;so far, so good.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
