Based on the nitrogen adsorptionisothermal lines of these reactivated carbons, variations of in adsorptionproperties and parameters were studied to clarify the difference in theiradsorption properties. 2 grams of activated carbon was placed in theactivation device. The temperature was raised at the rate of 10{sup 0}C/minuntil it reached to the predetermined temperature (750 - 950{sup 0}C)when carbon dioxide was circulated at the rate of 0.5 l/min. Then theplaced activated carbon was activated for predetermined time (0.5 - 4h) to produce re-activated carbon. As the result of this study, the adsorptionproperties of activated carbon proved to depend largely on types of rawmaterial substances. The fact that the activated carbon made from coalhas larger VBET/VDR values than that made from coconut shell can be takenas natural since BET represents surface area of fine pores of activatedcarbon while DR shows the volume of micro pores.
