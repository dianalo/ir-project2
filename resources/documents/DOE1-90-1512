It is shown that multiple scattering has noeffect on energy polarization losses. This conclusion concerns the caseof one particle transport. In two or more particle transport situationis substantially different. If particle distance is small, interferencebetween fields, induced by these particles, is possible. In this casemultiple scattering effects the particle energy losses due to interferenceof these fields. In particular, this effect is observed in productionof high-energy electron-positron pairs in matter.</TEXT></DOC>
