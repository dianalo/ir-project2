Here are excerpts fromthe transcript, found in Ms. Lord's new book, &quot;Legacies: AChinese Mosaic&quot; (Knopf):                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Once Chinese believed that building a socialist societygave meaning to their lives. Now Chinese wonder why they wereborn. We do not have the means to live life, nor do we evenhave something to die for. We merely consume time.   At least five of our mutual friends are in Qing Chengprison, which is currently under the administration of themartial law forces. The interrogators assigned there are notfrom Beijing but have been transferred to the capital fromthroughout the country, just as the soldiers were. W--- is inanother prison, which is worse than Qing Cheng, one normallyrestricted to hardened criminals, not political offenders. Inthis stifling hot weather, sixteen men live in a space offourteen square meters. . . .   Now more and more the bloody and bungled aftermath at theSquare reminds me of what happened in the CulturalRevolution, when various factions, all claiming to besupporters of the Chairman, warred among themselves without aclue to Mao's intentions. I doubt if anyone -- the studentsor their leaders; the cadres or Deng or Li or Zhao; thesoldiers or their commanders -- knew what was really goingon. Not before, not during and not after the massacre. Theconfusion was total. And what's more, it was continuallybeing fueled by rumors -- conflicting rumors. Now thatconfusion has been transferred to the masses. . . .   Many party committees that oversee factories, unions andassociations donated membership dues to the demonstrators orsubmitted petitions on behalf of their organizations or evencarried banners in the parade. Now the Party must rely onthese same overseers to drum the official line into themembers of these units, and to investigate and rule on thepolitical reliability of those in their charge. It is afarce.   Military officers have been giving speeches on theTiananmen Square incident at key work units. Their openingline? &quot;My division did not fire its guns at the people.&quot;   No one, be he a high cadre or a lowly comrade in thestreet, accepts the official version. After two months ofthorough and nonstop indoctrination, the authorities havesucceeded only in making people parrot their lines atcompulsory political meetings, but they have not preventedthem from questioning their own government. Think of theimplications.   I find this condition -- when one has a self and one hasno self, when one thinks one's thoughts but speaks thethoughts of others -- unbearable. Was it only last May whenwe could say what we thought to those we trusted? SuddenlyChinese are hypocrites again.   There is no sense of security here now. Everyone speakslies. Everyone is at the mercy of reports. Everyone thinkshis telephone is bugged.   That is why I find my own behavior puzzling when I talk toyou. Each time I vow to censor myself, each time I forget,and each time when I hang up, I regret what I have said. Heream I, someone framed by telephone calls during the CulturalRevolution, repeating mistakes I paid for dearly. . . .   Why was it that when you were here I could talk to you sofreely? Because you gave me a sense of security. No one givesme that sense anymore, not even my dear old friend H----, whohas always been so good to me. Now I am especially afraid ofseeing her. Now we are bound together. What happens iftomorrow one of us is taken and questioned about the other?Do we lie or tell the truth? If we tell lies, that can onlycompound our insecurity. What if lies told by one indict theother?   I am all too familiar with their interrogation methods.They never ask you direct questions, or charge you withspecific deeds. They merely ask you to write what you dideach day and who was there with you. What can I write withoutinvolving her? And it would be the same for her with respectto me.   Mostly I stay home listening to classical music. Modernmusic is too disturbing. I am always hoping to lose myself inanother time, but I never succeed. I long for a girl to bewith me, someone who knows nothing about me and has nointerest in any of my concerns. I want to talk to her onlyabout the trivial things that make up her life. I don't wantto talk about me.   I want to lose myself in nature, in grass, in mountains.Last week I went to the Summer Palace at dawn and spent fourhours walking alone in that vast expanse. During that time Iwas myself. I did not worry about whether there was a thirdeye watching me. I did not worry about whether there was athird ear listening to me. I did not worry about whethermomentarily someone would grab me for interrogation. . . .   I hope to receive your calls more often, but as the timeof our separation lengthens and our lives change in oppositeways, can we still talk as easily and as profoundly as oncewe did?   I wish you good books. I wish your parents excellenthealth. I wish your husband happiness in his work. What elsecan I wish?   You are of another world.</TEXT></DOC>
