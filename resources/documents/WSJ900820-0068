Bass.   Under terms of a settlement announced Friday, TimesPublishing Co. and the Bass group agreed not to discusscertain details of the buy-back, including its price. TheFlorida newspaper company, however, is believed to haveagreed to pay between $50 million and $75 million for thestake that the Bass group bought for about $28 million inAugust 1988.</LP><TEXT>   The Bass group will share 40% of its profits from theTimes Publishing investment with two nieces of the lateNelson Poynter, who controlled the St. Petersburg Times from1947 until his death in 1978. The Bass group purchased itsTimes Publishing stock from the two nieces, who inherited thestock from their mother, Mr. Poynter's sister. The nieces hadoffered their shares to Times Publishing after their mother'sdeath in 1987, but Times Publishing offered a price as low as$2.5 million.   The buy-back ends a dispute between the Bass group andTimes Publishing over the paper's financial structure. Thedispute broke into public view last January when the Bassgroup offered to buy the 60% of Times Publishing that itdidn't own for $270 million. Most of that 60% stake is ownedby the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, a St. Petersburgeducational foundation that the late Mr. Poynter set up toavoid estate taxes and keep control of the newspaper in thehands of local journalists.   The Poynter Institute, whose chairman, Andrew Barnes, isalso editor of the St. Petersburg Times and chairman of TimesPublishing, rejected the Bass group offer. The Bass groupalso sued Times Publishing and the Poynter Institute, seekingto force the company to redeem a preferred stock issue onwhich it has been paying dividends of more than 1,200% ayear. About 86% of the preferred dividends, amounting to morethan $3.2 million a year, go to the Poynter Institute.   Though the Bass group pledged to continue funding thePoynter Institute and said it would preserve the newspaper'sintegrity and independence, the offer made Mr. Bass thecenter of a storm of negative publicity as other journalistsquestioned Mr. Bass's motives.   Under the settlement, Times Publishing agreed to buy backimmediately from the Bass group an undisclosed amount ofstock, believed to be more than half the group's 40% stake.Times Publishing has an option to buy, and the Bass group hasan option to sell, the rest of the Bass group's stake at thesame price three years from now. Mr. Barnes, who previouslysaid he viewed Mr. Bass as an unwelcome shareholder, isvirtually certain to cause Times Publishing to exercise itsoption to buy the remaining shares from the Bass group. TheBass group agreed to give Mr. Barnes the right to vote itsshares in the interim.   Times Publishing agreed to redeem its preferred stock andto &quot;substantially increase&quot; the dividends it pays on itscommon stock over the next five years. The preferred sharesheld by the Poynter Institute will be exchanged for along-term subordinated debenture that will pay annualinterest approximately equal to the amount of the preferreddividends the institute currently receives. The principalamount and interest rate of the debenture weren't disclosed.   The Bass group agreed to drop its lawsuit and both sidesagreed to contribute $300,000 each to endow a professorshipin media ethics and press policy at the University of SouthFlorida in St. Petersburg. The gifts will be matched by$420,000 from the state of Florida and the professorship willbe named after the late Eleanor Poynter Jamison, whosedaughters sold their stock to the Bass group.   In a statement, David Bonderman, Mr. Bass's chief aide,said, &quot;We always believed this to be a good investment andare happy we could work with Andy Barnes to help end a familydispute that has brewed for years.&quot; Mrs. Jamison frequentlydisagreed with Mr. Poynter's management of the newspaper, andonce sued him.   Mr. Barnes said in a statement, &quot;The agreement assures thelong-term independence, journalistic control and competitivevigor of the St. Petersburg Times, as well as significantongoing financial support for the Poynter Institute. WhileTimes Publishing is incurring some debt, it will in no wayinterfere with our operations, our staffing, our affiliatesor our growth.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
