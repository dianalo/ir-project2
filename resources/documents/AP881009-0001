But FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said the agency remained ingood shape and is expected to have reserves of $15 billion to $16billion at the end of the year despite the mammoth bailout of FirstRepublicBank Corp. and a recent call for help by MCorp, both inDallas.   Meanwhile, Seidman and Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarkereiterated their opposition to a possible merger of the FDIC, whichinsures deposits of about 14,000 banks and savings institutions,and the troubled Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., whichinsures 3,200 savings and loans. Both organizations cover depositsof up to $100,000.   Seidman told a news conference at the American BankersAssociation's annual convention that by the end of 1988 as many as250 banks will have failed or needed federal assistance to stayafloat.   Last year a record 184 FDIC-insured institutions failed and 19received federal assistance. Reserves at the end of 1987 totaled$18.3 billion.   ``Right now the '89 outlook looks better to us. It (the failurerate) could go down as much as 25 percent,'' Seidman said. ``But Imust caution you I made that same prediction a year ago.''   Seidman said the problem-bank list is slowly declining.   The farm and energy belts in the Southwest, particularly Texas,were the biggest trouble spots, said FDIC spokesman Alan J. Whitney.   Among the biggest bailouts was First RepublicBank Corp., thelargest bank in Texas. It had $28.6 billion in assets when the FDICseized all 40 of its subsidiary banks earlier this year beforeagreeing to sell them to NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.   And last week, MCorp, the second-largest bank in Texas withassets of about $20.1 billion, said that it probably would needfederal assistance to survive. The bank said it expected to postthe biggest loss in its history, about $525 million, in the thirdquarter that ended Sept. 30.   Seidman said it was too soon to tell how much federalassistance, if any, might be needed for MCorp. ``We just receivedtheir application on Saturday,'' he said. ``It's premature to haveany opinion.''   Still, Seidman said that ``a number of substantial institutions... are interested'' in a possible investment in MCorp.   In discussing the ailing savings and loan industry, both Seidmanand Clarke said they remained opposed to a merger of the FDIC andFSLIC. However, both agreed it was likely to be considered byCongress and the new president.   The FDIC hopes to complete a study that began about eight monthsago on possible solutions for the thrift crisis, Seidman said. Thecost of liquidating or rescuing the nearly 800 problem thriftsnationwide has ranged from $45 billion to $100 billion, and manyexperts are predicting that taxpayers eventually will have to footthe bill.   But Clarke insisted ``all other alternatives should beconsidered before the taxpayers are asked to pick up the tab.''</TEXT></DOC>
