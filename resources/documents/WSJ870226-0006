The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, reported late Tuesday that U.S. refinery utilization stood at 80.1% of capacity for the week ended last Friday, up from 80% a week earlier and 78.7% a year ago.    The figures, which portend more refined products on the market in the coming weeks, surprised many traders and analysts who had expected refinery numbers to decline significantly this month. Industry analysts say the utilization levels have been high because rising prices in December and January have propped refiners' profit margins.    Many refiners have also become convinced that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will be unable to maintain its new fixed-price schedule based on $18 a barrel. There isn't any hard evidence yet that the OPEC accord is unraveling, but many refiners are refusing to sign up for long-term purchase contracts with OPEC countries at the new pricing levels because they think they'll be able to buy crude at lower prices later. Such a development could contribute to the pact's undoing.    Moreover, the industry statistics indicate that U.S. product inventories are already running nearly 20 million barrels above last year's levels. Gasoline stockpiles, for example, are 11.2 million barrels, or 5% above a year ago, and fuel oil inventories are up 8.8 million, or 7%, compared with the same time last year.    &quot;We're drowning in products,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, energy futures analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York.    Yesterday, crude oil prices for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after plummeting to a low of $16.05 a barrel, closed at $16.40, down 33 cents a barrel for the day. Heating oil contracts for March delivery fell 1.11 cents a gallon, to 43.90 cents, and March unleaded gasoline contracts fell 0.91 cent, to 44.98 cents a gallon.    Meanwhile, the spot, or non-contract, price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, fell 30 cents to $16.40 a barrel, and the spot price of North Sea Brent, a major European blend, fell 55 cents to $15.95 in late trading.    Reflecting the lower U.S. crude oil prices, which have fallen $1.37 a barrel, or nearly 8% this week alone, Sun Refining andamp; Marketing Co., a Sun Co. unit, said it lowered the price it pays for West Texas Intermediate by $1.50, to $16 a barrel.    The waning confidence in the OPEC accord has also prompted some refiners to sell excess inventories, contributing to the weakening of product markets, while others are scheduling early &quot;turnarounds&quot; -- closings of plants for maintenance and change of fuel mix usually done in late spring-for next month.    &quot;So much of it is emotion,&quot; says Dewey Mark, executive vice president of Diamond Shamrock Refining andamp; Marketing Co. &quot;If the buyer (of crude oil) thinks the market is going down, he's going to operate on lower inventories, and refining margins aren't good.&quot;    Washington-based Independent Term Supply, which acquires crude oil world-wide for some 12 U.S. refiners, has begun negotiating for petroleum &quot;cargo by cargo,&quot; says John Venners, president. The latest purchase: a cargo of Australian crude at a price below OPEC's.    &quot;The handwriting is on the wall,&quot; he says. &quot;Fixed prices work when you are afraid you can't get next month's supply, but with these product prices you cannot expect refiners to pay (OPEC) a premium for security (of crude supply).&quot;    Crude prices rose by as much as $3 to $4 a barrel following OPEC's December price agreement. That, and the end to &quot;netback&quot; arrangements -- under which refiners were almost ensured a profit because they paid for OPEC crude a price that would be determined by the wholesale value of the refined products -- sharply narrowed profit margins for processors of petroleum. Mr. Venners says that at $17.50 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, &quot;a refiner loses $2 a barrel.&quot;    Some refiners, as a result, already are reducing the prices they pay for crude in the U.S. -- where the buyer rather than the seller sets the price -- by as much as $1.50 a barrel. And there were unconfirmed reports among industry sources that Nigeria, a key African member of OPEC, is offering to discount its official prices in order to maintain sales volumes.    Product markets began weakening several weeks ago even as prices of crude oil were firming. A planning executive at one major oil company attributes the weakening to generally sluggish demand for fuels, partly because of a relatively mild winter so far, and to an oversupply of gasoline. Whatever the reason, he says, &quot;we are seeing a definite change in psychology on the outlook for oil prices.&quot;    Some analysts say the oversupply won't be whittled away soon. Robert Boslego, a vice president of Boslego Corp., a Winchester, Mass., oil consultant, expects product stockpiles to reach as much as 45 million barrels above last year's levels within the next six weeks, even if refinery utilization falls.    A late price recovery yesterday was attributed partly to wire reports that Saudi Arabia's production for the first three weeks of February averaged 3.1 million to 3.3 million barrels a day, well below its 4.133 million barrel quota. Some analysts expect the lower Saudi output numbers to soon reverse the oil-price decline.    Separately, yesterday's oil-price drop helped push the Commodity Research Bureau's Futures Price index, a major gauge of commodity prices, to the lowest level in more than six months. </TEXT></DOC>
