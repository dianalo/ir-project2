SchlesingerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CANDA FC C F GM LABORAUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> DEARBORN, Mich.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Auto Workers union picked Ford Motor Co. over General Motors Corp. as its target for a settlement or possible strike in national contract negotiations.    The choice was widely expected for a variety of reasons, mainly because Ford currently is more profitable than GM, and may be in a position to sign a more generous contract.    Negotiations now will go on hold at GM, while Ford and the union try to reach an agreement by the Sept. 14 deadline. But the decision could create serious problems for GM and for the union later on. The reason: GM says it can't afford an agreement similar to one likely to be reached by Ford. But GM workers are accustomed to pattern bargaining and may reject one that is too different.    GM's labor situation could become even more complicated today, when the independent Canadian Auto Workers union is expected to pick its strike target. An announcement won't come until tomorrow. In addition to GM and Ford, the Canadian union also could select Chrysler Corp. Chrysler's U.S. contract doesn't expire until next year.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Ford's shares closed at $108, up 75 cents; GM's closed at $92, up $2, and Chrysler's at $44.75, down 25 cents.    &quot;It's been said that Ford is a hotbed of good ideas,&quot; UAW President Owen Bieber said at a crowded news conference following the announcement. &quot;So we're going to give them the opportunity to demonstrate that the same is true in the labor relations arena.&quot;    The union's 23-member executive board made the decision at the Dearborn Hyatt hotel just across the street from Ford's headquarters. The decision disappointed the 350 GM delegates from around the country, but the 200 Ford representatives, who relished the idea of setting the contract pattern in the national talks, greeted the announcement with thunderous applause. &quot;We're No. 1, We're No. 1,&quot; one representative from a Ford Ohio plant shouted as he left the auditorium.    Mr. Bieber reiterated the union's position that in this round of talks, &quot;This challenge is not primarily about money, it's about securing the jobs of American workers.&quot;    Later, Ford's top negotiator, Stanley J. Surma, said in a separate news conference that the company is willing to pursue that principle. &quot;The company's primary objective in these negotiations is to reach a peaceful settlement which responds to the concern of employees and the union for job security,&quot; he said. &quot;We've also indicated that job security is inseparable from our need for continuing quality and also competitiveness,&quot; he added.    GM, however, may not be so enthusiastic about any job-security program Ford adopts. GM has said repeatedly that because it makes more parts internally than Ford, it may not consider a Ford agreement relevant. &quot;There are sufficient differences between GM and its domestic competitors that demand a separate agreement specifically tailored to GM,&quot; the company said in a statement released after the target decision was made.    Mr. Bieber insisted that &quot;there will continue to be a pattern in our UAW agreements.&quot; But he left the door open for cracks, saying that &quot;where differences are necessary and appropriate, there may be differences.&quot;    One UAW official suggested the union could preserve the appearance of pattern bargaining by reaching similar agreements for Ford and GM assembly operations, but different provisions for GM's parts operations.    Mr. Bieber said many factors entered into the target decision. But the main reason that outsiders have long been speculating Ford would be the target is economics. The No. 2 auto maker last year made a bigger profit than the much larger GM for the first time in six decades. At the end of June, Ford had $9 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand. That seems to put Ford in a better position to agree to what the union wants. And Ford, which is running at full capacity and has below-normal inventories, would appear more vulnerable to a strike.    The last time Ford was the target was in 1976, when it took a monthlong strike. GM was the target in 1979 and settled without a walkout. GM also was the target in the crisis bargaining of 1982, but couldn't reach an agreement, so the union turned to Ford for the first pact. The UAW picked GM in 1984, and got an agreement after a weeklong strike at selected plants.    In Toronto, Robert White, president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, said the UAW's decision to select Ford as its strike target &quot;confirms what I thought&quot; would be the UAW's strategy. But Mr. White said he doesn't expect a U.S. strike at Ford, which is financially healthier than GM and better able to negotiate a settlement. &quot;So if the question is, does (the UAW's decision) take Ford of Canada out of the box, the answer is 'no,'&quot; he said.    Mr. White said he won't announce the Canadian union's strike target or strategy until tomorrow. Mr. White is to meet today with the Canadian Auto Workers' 13-member national executive board to discuss the subject.    Mr. White said the Canadian units of the Big Three auto makers are continuing to watch developments in the U.S. talks before making any additional proposals. Only Chrysler's unit in Canada has put forth proposals so far, and they quickly were rejected by the union. </TEXT></DOC>
