But the Pentagon's current spending blueprint doesn'tenvision any of those savings, Bush administration officialssaid. In fact, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has orderedbudgets drawn up that leave nuclear-weapons spendingbasically intact through the mid-1990s. And he has told eachof the services to assume that personnel cuts won't go beyondthose previously embraced by the Pentagon.</LP><TEXT>   The recently signed Strategic Arms Reductions Talks treatybetween the U.S. and Soviet Union would save several hundredmillion dollars a year, while President Bush's recentproposals to destroy or mothball short-range nuclear weaponswould save about as much.   The starkly different projections of military spendingstake out the boundaries for a protracted and heatedelection-year struggle over military expenditures.   In the most comprehensive independent analysis so far ofthe fiscal impact of the latest U.S.-Soviet arms-controlproposals, the CBO projected a nearly 20% cut in the overallU.S. nuclear-weapons budget -- amounting to $9.3 billion inannual savings -- under the cutback scenario that theadministration appears most likely to accept.   If the number of nuclear warheads permitted under theSTART treaty were cut by roughly one-third, the congressionalreport said, the U.S. could save $5 billion annually inacquisition and operating costs of long-range offensivesystems. Billions more could be saved each year by scalingback command-and-control operations, reducing EnergyDepartment expenditures for warhead production, and cuttingantimissile research.   Under this scenario, the CBO study predicted total savingsof $75 billion through the end of 1999 even if the B-2Stealth bomber survives and the administration builds ascaled-back version of its proposed anti-missile defensesystem, dubbed the Strategic Defense Initiative.   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has called for 50%reductions in some types of long-range missiles. The CBOstudy indicated that such cuts, if the White House agrees tothem, could increase U.S. savings to about $125 billionthrough the decade.   Secretary Cheney, however, is digging in his heels andrejecting even modest cuts in the &quot;Base Force&quot; laid outbefore last summer's revolution in the Kremlin. Furtherbudget-cutting moves by the Pentagon would be politicallyself-defeating at this point, a high-ranking administrationofficial said last week, because it &quot;would just create a newbase line&quot; that Congress would use to make heftier cuts. &quot;Itwould be like a donation&quot; to Democrats demanding swiftdefense reductions, he said.   Mr. Cheney has instructed Pentagon planners to stick withthe previously announced $292 billion ceiling for defenseoutlays for the fiscal year starting in October 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
