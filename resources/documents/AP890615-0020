North cleared the way for the former National SecurityCouncil aide to be sentenced next week for his role in theIran-Contra affair.   In his ruling Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesellrefused to grant a defense request for either a new trial orjudgments of acquittal on all three counts against North.   A U.S. District Court jury convicted North on May 4 of aiding andabetting the obstruction of Congress, mutilation of officialdocuments and acceptance of an illegal gratuity from arms dealerRichard V. Secord.   The 45-year-old retired Marine lieutenant colonel, scheduled forsentencing June 23, faces a possible 10-year prison term and finesup to $750,000.   North was found guilty of aiding and abetting the obstruction ofCongress by helping prepare a false chronlogy of arms sales to Iranin 1985 and by destroying documents sought by congressionalinvestigators.   North was acquitted him of nine other charges, includingallegations that he lied to investigators about his involvement inU.S.-Iran arms sales and providing secret aid to the Nicaraguanrebels.   Gesell ruled in his 13-page opinion there was sufficient prooffor the jury to reach its verdict. Gesell also rejected the notionthat North could not be found guilty of helping obstruct Congresssince the lawmakers' inquiry succeeded in unearthing facts about theIran-Contra affair.   ``The criminality of legality of alleged obstructive conductcannot turn on its success, as the effort to obstruct an inquiry isan evil the statute seeks to address,'' Gesell said.   Gesell also rejected North's arguments prosecutors had failed toprove that North's illegal acceptance of the installation of a$13,800 security system outside his suburban Virginia home hadoccurred in Washington, where the case was brought.   Gesell said ``the agreement to accept the security systemdeveloped in a continuous course of conduct, some of which tookplace in Washington.''   The judge rejected arguments that the jury should have beeninstructed to consider that North accepted the security system underduress because no government agency would offer his familyprotection in the face of terrorist threats, including one from AbuNidal.   ``Long after North heard of the threat by Abu Nidal, he backdatedletters indicating he was to pay for the system and he concealed thefact that Secord had actually paid (security consultant Glenn)Robinette for the system,'' the judge said.   Gesell also said North could have paid for the fence with funds``he admittedly had,'' a reference to North's testimony he kept$15,000 in cash in a locked box in his closet.   Gesell rejected North's request for a hearing to determine if theverdict was tainted by an April 22 letter NBC News delivered to thehomes of jurors seeking interviews after they decided the case.   He also denied another motion, which had been made under seal,seeking a closed hearing on alleged conduct of a juror. The contentsof the motion were not released.</TEXT></DOC>
