Under the terms of a novel, risk-sharing agreement withthe FDIC, First Union will pay a total of $212 million forSoutheast, based in Miami. The figure includes a cash paymentof $81 million to the FDIC and the establishment of a $131million loan-loss reserve.</LP><TEXT>   The FDIC estimated that the failure of Southeast willultimately cost the bank deposit insurance fund $350 million,a remarkably low cost for such a large bank.   Regulators closed the $10.2 billion Southeast Bank, Miami,and the $93 million Southeast Bank of West Florida,Pensacola, last night. The closed banks' 224 offices willreopen today as branches of First Union National Bank ofFlorida. All deposits, including those over the $100,000ceiling for federal deposit insurance coverage, will move toFirst Union, meaning that no depositor will suffer a loss.About 10% of the banks' $8 billion in deposits wereuninsured, the FDIC said. The transaction will wipe out theinterests that Southeast's stock- and bondholders had in thebanks.   The acquisition of Southeast will make First Union thesecond-largest banking organization in the important Floridamarket, behind Barnett Banks Inc. Barnett, based inJacksonville, and SunTrust Banks Inc. of Atlanta both bidunsuccessfully for Southeast.   &quot;Banking is getting better all the time for thesurvivors,&quot; said Timothy Rayl, an analyst with SoutheastResearch Partners Inc., a research concern in Boca Raton,Fla. &quot;This vaults First Union into a very strong secondposition in Florida.&quot;   First Union said it expects the acquisition to add about$60 million in net income in 1992, $100 million in 1993 and$115 million to $150 million each year from 1994 to 1996. Forthe second quarter, First Union had net income of $73.6million, or 61 cents a share.   First Union, which has a strong record for cutting costsat acquired institutions, said it expects to reduce theoperating expenses of the Southeast operations by $260million by 1993.   Southeast's failure was precipitated by a Federal ReserveBoard decision to call $568 million in loans it had madethrough its discount window to help Southeast cover large andcontinuing deposit withdrawals in recent months. In the past,the Fed has often kept sick banks alive for extended periods,but the House Banking Committee recently charged that suchlife-support lending ends up boosting the cost of bankfailures to FDIC.   In the face of this criticism, regulators moved quickly toclose the bank, which had suffered large losses from bad realestate loans. The relatively rapid closure means that FirstUnion got &quot;an attractive franchise that hadn't been allowedto deteriorate much,&quot; said Harrison Young, the FDIC'sdirector of resolutions.   The First Union-Southeast transaction is the most dramaticexample to date of a new FDIC effort to speed the closure ofsick banks in order to reduce the cost to the shrinking BankInsurance Fund and minimize disruptions to borrowers.   Unlike other large bank failures, such as the Bank of NewEngland this year, the FDIC closed Southeast while it wasstill solvent, although illiquid. As of last night, the bankstill had about $950 million in capital and loan-lossreserves.   In another difference from earlier closings, the FDIC andFirst Union will share the risk and the cost of managingSoutheast's $631 million portfolio of nonperforming loans. Inbank failures, the FDIC traditionally has absorbed the fulllosses, but First Union will absorb 15% of any losses, withthe FDIC accepting the balance.   In return for accepting 15% of the losses, First Unionwill be given unusual latitude by the FDIC to work out loanproblems. In the past, acquiring banks managed nonperformingloan portfolios under incentive arrangements that oftenencouraged a rapid liquidation of bad loans, oftenexacerbating tight credit conditions in the failed bank'smarket area.   First Union will pay as much as 35% of the losses incurredon credit card and home equity loans over the five-year,cost-sharing agreement.   In another difference from past resolutions of failedbanks, the FDIC agreed to take over a portfolio of about $180million in foreclosed properties, known as Other Real EstateOwned. None of the bidders wanted to accept the uncertainliability from environmental litigation that could arise fromthese properties.   The combination of the losses the FDIC will absorb on thenonperforming loan portfolio and the losses from selling offthe foreclosed properties will contribute to the $350 millioncost of the Southeast failure.   Three provisions of the agreement will help First Unionfinance the takeover of Southeast. The FDIC accepted afive-year, $631 million note from First Union to cover thecost of carrying the nonperforming loans. First Union willpay a nominal interest rate of 0.125% a year. In addition,the FDIC will purchase $150 million of 11% perpetualpreferred stock from First Union. After a year, the FDIC cansell the stock, but the agency fully expects First Union torefinance the stock at a lower interest rate within a year.Finally, the FDIC agreed to repay Southeast's $568 millionloan from the Federal Reserve.</TEXT></DOC>
