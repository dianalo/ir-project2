The ministers warnedof the price drop, wich is expected to increase energy consumption andreduce domestic power generation, thus making the IEA member states dependenton imported oil. For the Nineties, the Agency predicts rising oil pricesand tighter world energy markets. This should be prevented by givingfinancial aid to domestic exploration and development, diversificationof energy sources used for power generation, and higher oil reserves.The IEA also announced to remove trade restrictions, a decision whichdid not remain undisputed. It is directed mainly against the German coalmining industry which is still the foremost within the European Communities.(orig./MOS).</TEXT></DOC>
