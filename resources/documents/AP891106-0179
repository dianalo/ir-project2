Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have made extensive use of thenets in the Pacific Ocean to catch squid.   Drift nets can be 30 miles wide and a U.S. delegate, AmbassadorJonathan Moore, said they ``catch every living thing with whichthey come in contact, with the exception of fish small enough topass through the mesh size.''   Moore told a General Assembly committee the United States willjoin 11 other nations in sponsoring a resolution that would banlarge drift nets.   The measure would abolish drift net fishing immediately in theSouth Pacific and phase it out worldwide by June 30, 1992.   Moore said the United States does not object to developingnations using small drift nets that allow fish to multiply andrenew the stock.   But he said the use of vast drift nets is ``an inherentlyindiscriminate and potentially devastating technology.''   He told the committee such nets violate the principle ofsustainable development by harvesting and killing fish and marinelife faster than they can reproduce.   Sponsoring the resolution on drift net fishing along with theUnited States are New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Fiji, Mauritania,Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Zaire, Colombia andSweden.   It does not single out any nation for criticism, but expressesconcern about the indiscriminate nature of drift net fishing andsets out proposals for international management and the eventualban of the nets.   Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer of New Zealand told the GeneralAssembly last month that drift nets are ``walls of death'' and thattheir use has depleted salmon stocks in the North Pacific.   In Seattle, six Western states and the province of BritishColumbia issued a proclamation at a news conference urging theirfederal governments to act to reduce drift net fishing in the NorthPacific.   The proclamation was issued by the states of Alaska, Washington,Oregon, Idaho, California and Hawaii and by British Columbia andwas announced during the meeting in Seattle of the InternationalNorth Pacific Fisheries Commission.</TEXT></DOC>
