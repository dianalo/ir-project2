The credit generally is available to a taxpayer who, in order tofind or keep a job, pays another person to care for a child under 15or other dependent. That dependent could be a disabled spouse; anydisabled person who could be claimed by the taxpayer as a dependent;or a disabled person who had $1,950 or more in income and, thus,could not be claimed by another.   The hired person may not be your spouse, your child under the ageof 19 or any person you may claim as a dependent. In the case of acouple, both spouses must work full time or part time to claim thecredit, unless one is a full-time student or is disabled.   The credit applies to amounts paid for household services andcare of the dependent while the taxpayer works or looks for work.These can include services of a cook, babysitter or housekeeper inthe home, as well as costs of outside care for a child under 15, butnot costs of overnight camp. Outside care for a disabled dependentof any age also is covered if that person regularly spends at leasteight hours a day in your home.   Special rules apply to children of divorced or separated parents.   There are these limitations on the credit:   _ The total of claimed dependent-care expenses may not exceedyour earned income (wages, fees, tips and the like) or, in the caseof a couple, the earnings of the lower-paid spouse.   _ The maximum claimed expenses are $2,400 for one dependent and$4,800 for two or more.   _ The credit is for 30 percent of eligible expenses if youradjusted gross income is $10,000 or less. It drops one percentagepoint for each $2,000 of income; the credit is 20 percent for incomeabove $28,000.   Taxpayers who file the long Form 1040 must also fill out Form2441 to claim the credit. Filers of 1040A must attach Schedule 1.   Claiming the child-care credit can bring these complications:   _ If you pay $50 or more in a calendar quarter to someone whocares for your dependent, you generally must pay Social Security taxof 7.51 percent on those wages, withhold another 7.51 percent fromthe worker's wages and forward the full 15.02 percent each quarterby filing Form 942.   _ Paying wages of $1,000 or more in a quarter may also subjectyou to paying unemployment taxes. Get Form 940 for details.   _ You may have to calculate whether you are subject to thealternative minimum tax. This is a flat 21 percent tax that you payonly if it exceeds your regular income tax; it is aimed atpreventing well-to-do people from totally avoiding taxes through useof large deductions.   Check the back of Form 2441 to see whether you should beconcerned about the minimum tax.</TEXT></DOC>
