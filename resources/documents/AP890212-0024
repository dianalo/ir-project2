Although tight airport security has all but eliminated hijackingsin the United States, the Dec. 21 bombing of the Boeing 747 thatkilled 259 people en route to New York and 11 more on the groundraises the spectre of a more deadly kind of air terrorism.   It also raises questions about how to respond to the more than900 threats against U.S. airlines each year, including when to warnthe public.   Federal Aviation Administration officials told two congressionalcommittees last week that airlines have greatly increased securitymeasures for foreign flights since the bombing of Flight 103.   All checked baggage is X-rayed. Passengers are denied any accessto baggage after check-in. Passengers are matched with bags to guardagainst unaccompanied baggage. Additional measures preventunauthorized access to luggage or planes. And more passengers aresubjected to random enhanced screening with suitcases actuallyopened by inspectors.   ``We will not hesitate to tilt the balance toward improvedsecurity and away from convenience when that is necessary to protectour citizens,'' FAA Administrator Allan McArtor told one of twocongressional hearings last week.   He indicated those measures and others _ which airlines will notdiscuss _ have brought little complaint.   But airline officials and members of Congress want the increasedsecurity imposed on foreign carriers flying into the United Statesas well. The Air Transport Association, which represents U.S.carriers, estimates that 50 percent of international travel by U.S.citizens is on foreign airlines.   ``Beefing up security only for U.S. carriers would be like havingpolicemen patrol only odd numbered streets,'' said Richard F. Lally,association vice president for security.   Raymond A. Salazar, FAA director for civil aviation security,told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that U.S. airlines areconsidered the major target for terrorists and that attempting toimpose unilateral restrictions on foreign carriers could start ``anair war.''   But Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner hopes to reach aconsensus on international security measures at this week's specialmeeting of the 33-member Council of the International Civil AviationOrganization in Montreal. The United States and Great Britain calledfor the meeting to discuss steps to take following the Pan Ambombing.   In addition to U.S. inability to control foreign airlines andairports, authorities trying to combat terrorist attacks againstairliners face weapons that X-rays can't detect and threats thatoften come from sources they can't identify.   At least two devices are under development that can detectplastic explosives such as those investigators believe were plantedin luggage aboard Flight 103.   One is an explosive vapor detection system that checks people forexplosives. FAA officials say preliminary tests were conducted atBoston's Logan Airport but it is still in the testing stage.   The FAA has already tested and used two $1 million ``thermalneutron analysis'' machines at California airports and has orderedsix more. Airline officials say the units should be sent right awayto high-risk airports in Europe and the Middle East. The FAA hasidentified 73 airports which it considers the most vulnerable toterrorism.   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., has asked the FAA to determine howmany machines would be needed for critical airports, how much theywill cost and who ought to pay for them.   In another congressional inquiry, Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill.,chairwoman of the Government Operations transportation subcommitteewhich plans hearings on Flight 103 next month, has asked the FAA toprovide details of its procedures for warning of threats againstaviation.   In letters last week to the FAA and Pan Am, Collins asked fordocuments relating to a telephone threat received by the U.S.Embassy in Helsinki against Pan Am flights from Frankfurt to NewYork two weeks before Flight 103 was destroyed. The State Departmentsays the threat was a hoax and no public warning was made, but anotice disclosing the threat was posted on the Moscow Embassybulletin board eight days before the explosion.   L. Paul Bremer, ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism, toldCongress the notice should not have been posted and said thegovernment has a policy of not issuing such warning unless they arealso made to the general public.   He said if warnings were issued for every threat, it couldcripple commercial aviation.   But survivors of Flight 103 victims, in a statement last week,said passengers should be provided, on request, details of anythreat against a flight they plan to take.</TEXT></DOC>
