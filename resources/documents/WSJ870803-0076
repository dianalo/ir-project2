Connally filed for personal bankruptcy-law protection while his real estate venture filed for liquidation, citing the collapse of the market in Texas.    The filings late Friday illustrate how the fortunes of Mr. Connally have paralleled the roller-coaster ride of the Southwest's economy in recent years.    Mr. Connally, who served three terms as governor of Texas and then turned from a failed 1980 presidential bid to invest heavily in his home state, personally filed in Austin, Texas, for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.    At the same time, the Barnes-Connally Partnership, the company Mr. Connally started in 1981 with his friend and former Texas Lt. Gov. Ben F. Barnes in hopes of cashing in on a real-estate boom, filed for liquidation under Chapter 7 of the code.    The real estate venture had borrowed heavily to build $200 million of office buildings, shopping centers, houses and apartments in Texas and New Mexico -- just as plummeting oil prices pulled the plug on the booming Southwest economy.    But the partnership has been hit with a series of lawsuits and foreclosures by creditors in recent months. At one point, the New Mexico attorney general's consumer protection division accused the partnership of using misleading sales tactics in selling time-share condominiums.    Mr. Connally's personal filing listed a number of unsecured creditors, including Bell Savings andamp; Loan Association, San Mateo, Calif., $11 million; Western Savings, Dallas, $5 million; RepublicBank Dallas, $4 million; Delta Savings of Texas, Alvin, Texas, $2 million; and General Electric Credit Corp., $1 million.    In the filing, Mr. Connally didn't list his total assets and requested an extension to do so.    &quot;I'll have to start making a living now,&quot; Mr. Connally told the Associated Press. &quot;Any fees or money that I earn now will not be subject to the debts.&quot; He added he could &quot;go to legal work. I can go back to representing people. I can put deals together. I can do a lot of things. You won't see me at the food stamp line . . . and we're not going to run a telethon and ask for contributions.&quot;    Under Chapter 11, a debtor is protected from creditors while he works out a plan of reorganization. Under Chapter 7, a trustee or committee is elected to collect and liquidate all property and examine claims; if a debtor hasn't been found guilty of any misconduct, the court grants a discharge releasing the debtor from most of the pre-petition debts.    &quot;For the last year we have explored every avenue open to us in the United States, in Europe and the Far East in an attempt to restructure and refinance our obligations without success,&quot; a statement from the partnership said.    In addition, Mr. Connally resigned as chairman, chief executive officer and director, and Mr. Barnes resigned as director, of Chapman Energy Inc., the troubled Dallas oil and gas firm in which they invested. Mr. Connally and Mr. Barnes resigned at a board meeting at which Troon Partners Ltd., a Dallas oil and gas limited partnership that bailed out Chapman, took control of the board.    In 1982 when Chapman went public, Mr. Connally and Mr. Barnes each paid about $1 million for one million Chapman shares, and their strategy was to buy up cheap oil and gas assets as the oil bust hit. But oil prices stayed down and Chapman began piling up losses.    Chapman said Mr. Connally and Mr. Barnes each still hold one million shares of the company, or about a 1% stake. In over-the-counter trading Friday, Chapman's shares closed unchanged at 50 cents.    At the board meeting, Troon named four members to Chapman's board to take control. As previously reported, Chapman and Troon agreed in March to a restructuring plan in which Troon lent $6.5 million to Chapman. Chapman said it would have had to seek federal bankruptcy-law protection without the restructuring.    A Chapman spokesman said the company had reached an agreement with its principal lender, National Bank of Canada, to repay $23.3 million in bank debt in monthly payments equal to 85% of the net cash flow of Chapman's energy properties, and 15% of the net cash flow of its natural gas pipeline unit.    In addition, Chapman agreed to pay holders of $6 million in trade debt $800,000 for $2 million of the debt. The remaining $4 million is long-term debt that will be paid through an escrow account established by Chapman.    The spokesman said Chapman intends to continue acquiring oil and gas assets. He said the current assets of the company -- oil and gas reserves and a Kansas gas pipeline -- have a book value of about $24 million.    No successor to Mr. Connally was named. Troon's additions to Chapman's board are: Anthony Kramer, senior vice president and treasurer of Draper andamp; Kramer Inc., a Chicago-based real estate investment firm; Douglas Miller, chairman of Milmac Inc., the Dallas-based investment firm that is the general partner of Troon; James McAuley, president of Milmac; and Charles Funai, vice president and chief financial officer of Milmac. The addition of the four, and the resignations of Mr. Barnes and Mr. Connally, brings the size of the board to seven members. </TEXT></DOC>
