Federal government activity in this field is outlined, fromthe establishment of test sites to the implementing of demonstrationprograms for renewable energy projects. While these efforts were in progress,federal research and development activities have focused on design anddevelopment of vertical axis (Darrieus) wind machines, and have producedmeaningful results. Comparison is made with wind energy activities inCalifornia, which is felt to be the world leader. Forecasts are madeof the future trends for wind energy in Canada. The primary market forwind energy is likely to be in remote applications where conventionalelectricity costs are high. A second major market may be in grid-connectedwind farms, possibly on the east coast. Another major trend is the growthof installations for turbines in the 50-500 kW range. Two major governmentprograms that are suited for the aforementioned applications are brieflydescribed: the Remote Community Demonstration Program and Enerdemo-Canada.</TEXT></DOC>
