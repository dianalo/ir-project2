Gen. Richard Secord, underindictment in the Iran-Contra affair, today said he ``absolutely''doesn't expect to serve time for his role in the secret weaponsdeals.   ``I think the legal system itself is going to see the merit ofour case and will dismiss this indictment very quickly,'' he saidon ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''   Asked if he expected to ``do time'' on the charges, Secord said:``Absolutely not.''   ``I don't see any merit whatsoever to the case that's beenbrought by the special counsel,'' Secord continued.   He said his lawyers will argue that independent counsel LawrenceWalsh ``is running amok and without authority'' in prosecuting thecase.   ``I think that this is a completely uncontrollable and probablyillegal independent counsel ... trying to justify the expenditureof millions and millions and millions of dollars of taxpayer'smoney and 15 months of effort on a witch hunt,'' Secord said.   Secord said that in return for doing his duty and responding torequests from the White House, he finds himself ``trapped by a setof circumstances which none of us dreamed could ever becriminalized.''   ``I guess if I were to write a book, I'd proably entitle it, `Ifthe phones rings again, don't answer.'''</TEXT></DOC>
