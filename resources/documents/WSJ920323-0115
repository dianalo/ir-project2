Ever since the $875 million fund was listed on the NewYork Stock Exchange March 9, its shares have been trading atfar below the fund's per-share portfolio value. That hasmeant big losses for fund shareholders, who before thelisting had been able to sell their mutual fund shares forthe full portfolio value.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We followed closely the price at which the fund wastrading and felt we had to take action at this price,&quot; saysTony De Angelis, a marketing vice president with LosAngeles's Pilgrim Group, which manages the fund.   The fund, which invests in bank loans made to heavilyindebted companies, closed Friday at $8.75 a share, 12% belowthe fund's $9.99-a-share portfolio value.   The tender offer, which was announced after the marketclosed, is for 7.5 million of the fund's 87.5 million shares.Shares accepted under the tender offer will be cashed out atthe fund's full portfolio value.   &quot;It's a nice effort on {Pilgrim's} behalf to placateshareholder sentiment,&quot; says Jeffrey W. Maillet, manager ofVan Kampen Merritt Prime Rate Income Trust, one of the fundindustry's five prime rate funds. &quot;It's probably the lastthing everybody expected. It'll definitely raise the shareprice Monday morning.&quot;   Ron Olin, a fund specialist with Houston's Deep DiscountAdvisors, says Pilgrim's shareholders should make full use ofthe tender offer. &quot;If I were an existing shareholder, I wouldtender everything immediately, as much as I could,&quot; he says.   Pilgrim's initial decision to list its shares had stunnedthe fund industry. Shareholders didn't get a chance to voteon the decision, nor were they given the opportunity to selltheir shares prior to the fund's Big Board debut.   Following Pilgrim's listing of the shares, competitorssuch as Van Kampen and Eaton Vance Corp. put out statementssaying that they had no intention of following Pilgrim'slead. Instead, these fund groups said they would stick with asystem of quarterly tender offers allowing investors to sellshares at the full portfolio value.</TEXT></DOC>
