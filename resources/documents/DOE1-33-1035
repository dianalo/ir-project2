This project is designed to develop information on theeconomic and technical feasibility of using eucalpytus trees for energyfarming in Hawaii and similar subtopical regions, through field researchinto methods to increase productivity, development of optimal cultivationpractices and harvesting methods, as well as evaluation of the associatedcosts of the complete system from production through conversion. Eighty-ninemajor research experiments were installed both at the nursery and infields to evaluate species, spacing, nutrients (type, amount, and placement),herbicides, legumes, media, and other procedures for the express purposeof developing optimum cultivation practices. These tests are performedin both the Hilo and Ka'u areas and, in many instances, duplicated ondifferent soil types. Forty-one are still in progress. In general, itwas concluded that essentially all types of rubber-tired machines cannotoperate successfully on the fragile and wet soils and shallow soil maton Hawaii. BioEnergy's best short-run opportunity to conduct harvestingresearch and demonstration trials is to modify currently owned sugarcane harvesting machines, which have proven operability. Harvesting studiesusing conventional logging equipment gave preliminary costs of about$10 per green ton but did not leave the areas in very good conditionfor regeneration by coppicing. Studies have also been initiated to investigatethe economic returns from biomass and plantations of eucalyptus in Hawaii.An analysis using a harvesting cost of $10 per green ton, and late 1985-early1986 alternative energy costs for fuel oil and coal, gave after-tax ratesof return of 26% on the best agricultural land and 8% to 11% on forestland and waste land.</TEXT></DOC>
