The catalyticactivity of the complex depends on the nature of the carbon materialused as the substrate. It is shown that in the case of modification offinely divided materials (carbon black, charcoal), the activity of thecomplex is higher. The steady-state potential that is established oncharcoals modified by the complex is higher than on smooth pyrographiteelectrodes (0.9 V) and reaches 1.2 V. For finely divided carbon materialsit is shown that when their particle size increases, the catalytic activityof the complex at low polarizations increases.</TEXT></DOC>
