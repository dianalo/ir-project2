This revision is in the form of a February10, 1983, Opinion and Order of the Illinois Pollution Control Board (IPCB),PCB 82-9. This Opinion and Order grants a variance from the existing SIPrequirements until December 31, 1984, and provides an enforceable complianceschedule under State law.On May 27, 1983, IEPA submitted a proposed revision to its ozone SIP forthree laminators and four coaters operated by Moore American in Bridgeview,Illinois. This revision is in the form of an April 12, 1983, Opinion andOrder of the IPCB, PCB 82-1. This Opinion and Order grants a variance fromthe existing SIP requirements until December 31, 1983, and provides anenforceable compliance schedule under State law.On April 20, 1983, IEPA submitted a proposed revision to its ozone SIPfor pressure sensitive elastomeric films, mylar polyester on silicone releasepaper, and protective film overcoats with either heat reactive or pressuresensitive adhesives applied by Meyercord at its facility in Chicago, Illinois.This revision is in the form of a March 10, 1983, Opinion and Order ofthe IPCB, PCB 82-53. This Opinion and Order grants a variance from theexisting SIP requirements until January 31, 1986, and provides an enforceablecompliance schedule under State law.Under the existing federally approved SIP, each coating line unit for thecompanies listed above is subject to the emission control requirementscontained in Rule 205(n)(1)(C) of Chapter 2: Air Pollution of the IPCBRules and Regulations. Rule 205(n)(1)(C) limits volatile organic compound(VOC) emissions to 2.9 pounds of VOC per gallon. Final compliance was requiredby December 31, 1982.These sources are all located in the greater Chicago urban area, whichwas granted an extension until December 31, 1987, to attain the ozone nationalambient air quality standards. USEPA may approve compliance date extensionsfor sources in such an area, if the State demonstrates that the compliancedate meets the requirements of USEPA's policy on compliance date extensions.In a March 20, 1984, <T4> Federal Register</T4> (49 FR 10277), USEPA proposed to disapprovethese proposed SIP revisions because the Illinois ozone SIP lacked an approvableattainment demonstration for the Chicago nonattainment area. The attainmentdemonstration contained in the State's 1982 ozone SIP was initially proposedfor disapproval in the February 3, 1983, <T4> Federal Register</T4> (48 FR 5110). (Subsequently, on August 15, 1984(49 FR 5110), USEPA proposed to approve the State's revised 1982 SIP attainmentdemonstration. USEPA reproposed disapproval of the Illinois ozone planon July 14, 1987, (52 FR 26404)) and on October 17, 1988 (53 FR 40415),USEPA took final rulemaking action to disapprove the State plan.In response to USEPA's March 20, 1984, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, IEPAcommented that the reasons advanced by USEPA for disapproval of the proposedcompliance schedule changes in the March 20, 1984, Notice of Proposed Rulemakingno longer existed, because Illinois had submitted an approvable 1982 OzoneSIP attainment demonstration. IEPA commented that USEPA should, therefore,approve the proposed compliance date extension, without reproposal.If, however, there were alternative grounds for disapproval not statedin the March 20, 1984, Notice, the State commented that USEPA should reproposein a rulemaking which identified and addressed these grounds. On July 3, 1985 (50 FR 27462), USEPA published a supplemental notice ofproposed rulemaking on Arvey, Moore American and Meyercord, which identifiesalternative grounds for disapproval which were not discussed in the earlierproposed rulemaking. In the July 3, 1985, notice USEPA proposed to disapproveall three facilities because the State did not demonstrate that their complianceschedules were as expeditious as practicable. During the July 3, 1985, 30-day public comment period, USEPA received onecomment from the State with three major concerns. <ITAG tagnum="84">IEPA's Comment </ITAG>The basis for USEPA's proposed disapproval of the extended compliance schedulefor Moore American is its determination that the Company's compliance plan(reformulation to low solvent coatings) is not as expeditious as practicable.(50 FR 27463.) IEPA has commented that on June 27, 1985, the IPCB enteredinto a new order extending the variance which is the basis for the SIPrevision for Moore American, to December 31, 1985. The Opinion and OrderPCB 83-241 and the extension is relevant to the present proposed rulemaking,insofar as Moore American has now apparently decided to install a solventrecovery system, which it expects to be operational by December 31, 1985.The details of this system and Moore American's intentions are containedin the opinion of the Board in PCB 83-241, in excerpts from the hearingtranscripts, and in copies of letters from Moore American to the supplierof the solvent recovery system. It is IEPA's understanding that Moore Americanhas entered into a contract for the solvent recovery system and that thesystem will be completely operational by January 1, 1986. In light of theinstallation of a solvent recovery system by Moore American, IEPA urgesUSEPA to reconsider its proposed disapproval and finally approve MooreAmerican's variance as extended. The variance extension and supportingmaterial were formally submitted to USEPA on August 28, 1985, as a separateSIP revision. <ITAG tagnum="84">USEPA's Response </ITAG>Installation of a solvent recovery system by December 31, 1985, does notdemonstrate that Moore's low solvent conversion program had been proceedingas expeditiously as practicable. Additionally, IEPA's comment does notappear to be directly applicable to the disapproval USEPA is issuing today,because it involves a compliance date extension 2 years longer than theSIP revision which USEPA is disapproving today. USEPA will evaluate Illinois,revised compliance schedule as a separate SIP revision. <ITAG tagnum="84">IEPA's Comment </ITAG>The IEPA is concerned about the length of time taken by USEPA to act onSIP revisions, and particularly State variances from RACT VOC rules. Asnoted in the July 3, 1985, notice, Illinois submitted the SIP revisionsfor Arvey, Meyercord and Moore American in 1983. USEPA first proposed todisapprove these revisions in March 1984. IEPA interprets the Clean AirAct as requiring the USEPA to act on SIP revisions within the 4-month deadlineprovided in section 110(a)(2); this interpretation has also been suggestedby two Circuit Courts of Appeal. USEPA's policy regarding the review of SIP revision submittals from a Stateis set forward in an Agency document dated January l985 and entitled: ProcessingProcedures for SIP Revisions for Part 52; Part 62 111(d) Plans; and Part81 Redesignations. This document outlines USEPA's internal process forrulemaking on SIPs and revisions; it provides for more than 4 months forUSEPA rulemaking. USEPA has concluded that SIP revisions under andSection;110(a)(3) are not subject to the 4 month review under andSection; 110(a)(2).USEPA has concluded as a legal matter that the section 110(a)(2) referenceto SIP review within 4 months applies only to initial SIP submittals anddoes not apply to SIP revisions. USEPA approves SIP revisions under section110(a)(3) which does not contain any time limitation. Further, IEPA's commentson this issue are moot now that USEPA is taking final action on this SIPrevision.<ITAG tagnum="84">IEPA's Comment </ITAG>The question of timeliness of USEPA's rulemaking action on SIP revisionsis also tied into another concern of the IEPA. Illinois is very concernedabout USEPA's practice, as exemplified by the three SIP revisions at issuehere, of taking enforcement action while variances (SIP revisions) arepending which could resolve the matter or which could, after final action,be challenged in the Court of Appeals. IEPA believes that USEPA's practice,especially where USEPA takes so long to act on SIP revisions, deprivessources of their right of appeal and is disruptive of the State-Federalrelationship. <ITAG tagnum="84">USEPA's Response </ITAG>SIP revisions are not resolutions of enforcement actions. Until USEPA takesfinal rulemaking to approve a revision to a SIP, the applicable SIP isthe one that has previously been approved and applies to a source. USEPAwill continue to enforce this applicable SIP whenever it is violated. Thosesources that have complied with the SIP in good faith are entitled to relyon USEPA's enforcement of the SIP against the sources that choose not tocomply or have failed to challenge the SIP when it was appropriate to challengeit. A source has the opportunity to challenge a SIP rule when the Stateadopts it and again when USEPA takes final action on the rule, if it believesthe rule is somehow improper. <ITAG tagnum="84">Compliance Date Extension Policy </ITAG>A detailed discussion of USEPA's rationale for proposing disapproval ofcompliance date extensions, and of the Clean Air Act provisions and USEPApolicy related to compliance date extensions generally appears in AppendixA of the proposed rulemaking published on November 8, 1988 at 53 FR 45103.That Appendix A discussion reiterates that even under a compliance dateextension compliance should be expeditious. The State has not demonstratedthat these compliance date extensions are expeditious. The State has notprovided any information indicating that similar sources have been unableto comply in a timely fashion. In addition, USEPA policy also requiresthe timely attainment and maintenance of the ozone standard and, whererelevant, ``Reasonable Further Progress'' (RFP) towards timely attainment.This second criterion is the criterion which USEPA has been using throughoutits review of these extension requests. This criterion has been addressedin one or more of USEPA's technical support documents dated September 14,1983, May 10, 1984, May 16, 1984, September 13, 1985, and November 29,1985. Because the basis for disapproval discussed in the July 3, 1985 proposalstill remains, USEPA is disapproving these revisions on the grounds givenin that proposal. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action </ITAG>USEPA disapproves the final SIP revisions for Arvey, Moore American, andMeyercord because the proposed revisions do not conform with USEPA's compliancedate extension policy, and because the State has not demonstrated thatthis compliance schedule is as expeditious as practicable. Under Executive Order 12291, today's action is not ``Major''. It has beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. Undersection 307(b)(1) of the Act Petitions for judicial review of this actionmust be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by April 24, 1989. This action may not be challenged later in proceedingsto enforce its requirements.
