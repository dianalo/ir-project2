<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-61-0031 </DOCNO><TEXT>High-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (HR)EELS has been usedsuccessfully to provide direct spectroscopic evidence regarding detailsof the molecular fragmentation of methoxy (CH{sub 3}O) on Al(lll) causedby energetic electron and ion beams. Chemisorbed methoxy on Al(lll) isproduced by heating of absorbed CH{sub 3}OH. Irradiation of CH{sub 3}O(a)by either energetic (approx 300 eV) electrons or Ar+ ions results inC-O and C-H bond scission with simultaneous formation of Al-O and Al-Cbonds. During electron stimulated desorption the CH{sub 3}O(a) speciesundergo sequential fragmentation first to CHx groups that are capturedby the surface and in the final decay process to adsorbed carbon. C-Obonds in CH{sub 3}O{sub 9}a) are depleted preferentially compared toC-H bonds in CHx(a) species. The electron-induced sequential fragmentationof the patent CH{sub 3} group (from methoxy) to resultant CHx(a) occurswith an efficiency approx. 3 orders of magnitude greater than the subsequentprocess of CHx(a)=C(a). Cross sections for various bond scission processesin electron and ion bombardment have been estimated.</TEXT></DOC>
