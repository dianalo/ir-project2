No single development willovercome the longwall dust problem, therefore, engineers must work togetherto take full advantage of all technology available to provide answersto the problem. The Joint Coal Board is currently carrying out researchwith compressed air curtains on longwall units and continuous minersengaged in pillar extraction in an effort to bring the dustiest facesinto compliance. 5 refs., 5 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
