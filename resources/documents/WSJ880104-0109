The start of 1988 is no exception. Indeed, the degree of interest seems exceptional even for a new year. This reflects concern that last fall's stock-market crash may have signaled an approaching recession, as well as uneasiness over the extraordinary longevity of the expansion, which reached the five-year mark in November.    Happily, most forecasters reckon that the economy will keep expanding as 1988 unfolds. But this consensus deserves close scrutiny. It expects only a sluggish advance, with overall business activity rising about 2%. Such a pace would provide a perilously slim cushion in the event of unpleasant surprises. And important considerations point to just such a possibility.    Primary among these considerations is the cautionary message provided by last October's market crash.    This century has witnessed only eight earlier declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that approximately matched or exceeded the 1987 slide --from August 25 to October 19, a wrenching 36.1% drop. In seven of the eight previous declines, as recently noted on this page, the economy also slumped, sometimes starting down at roughly the same time as the market and sometimes more than a year later. The sole exception was in World War II when, with the all-out military buildup, the economy kept rising even though share prices fell more than 40%.    In predicting more recession-free growth as 1988 goes along, most forecasters apparently believe that the recent 36.1% market slide will prove another exception to the century-long record. Perhaps this will be the case, but experience suggests otherwise.    The market, of course, is but one of many yardsticks that forecasters employ to measure the road ahead. If most other precursors of the business outlook were continuing to climb smoothly, the market's message might be dismissed as falsely worrisome. But this is hardly the situation.    For instance, the Commerce Department's index of 11 leading economic indicators fell sharply in November and, while a large part of the decline reflects a falling stock-market component, most other components dropped as well. Among these others, significantly, was one that over many ups and downs of the business cycle has provided especially early and reliable forewarnings of trouble: a measure of the money supply, broadly defined and adjusted for inflation. The indicator has been edging down since early last year.    Another worrisome consideration is the longevity of the latest expansion. At five-plus years, even if it were to end this month, it has outlasted all but two of its 30 predecessors, both wartime upturns. Tracked back to 1854 by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the 30 earlier expansions lasted, on average, 33 months. Thus, the latest one has already enjoyed more than two years of borrowed time and, by the law of averages, a business-cycle downturn is way overdue.    Concern about an impending downturn may seem peculiar when some major facets of the economic scene continue to suggest strength. For example, a recent Commerce Department survey of business spending plans shows a 7.3% rise in plant-and-equipment outlays this year and the unemployment rate recently fell to 5.8% of the labor force, which is as low as at any time since the 1970s.    However, such showings by no means rule out a recession just ahead. Plant-and-equipment spending usually reaches a peak some months after the economy as a whole has entered a recession and joblessness often is lowest just before a recession starts.    If the consensus proves wrong, and a recession does develop in coming months, how severe might it be?    The prevailing view among the minority of forecasters who do anticipate a 1988 recession is that it will be far milder than, say, the 16-month slump of 1981-82, when the unemployment level reached nearly 11%. Reasonably typical is an estimate by analysts at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. that the economy probably &quot;will move into recession&quot; early this year, but the downturn &quot;will be mild&quot; for reasons ranging from &quot;a perfectly timed consumer tax cut&quot; to &quot;steady improvement&quot; on the export front.    While such factors could indeed serve to mitigate any new slump, other developments could work to make things worse.    For example, sky-high levels of debt overshadow the economic landscape. Debt tends to cause relatively little trouble so long as the economy is on the rise, but it can cause considerable pain in a slump. It now amounts to roughly 1.7 times the gross national product, the highest such ratio since the worst years of the Great Depression, when the GNP was shrinking and bankruptcies were soaring. In 1981, when President Reagan took office, the ratio was less than 1.4. -   Any new recession, mild or severe, would most likely be accompanied by new lows in the stock market. While share prices nearly always fall before a recession starts, they also nearly always keep falling for at least a few months after a slump is under way. If a recession were to begin, say, in March, share prices could well be lower in mid-1988than even at last October's low point.    A far happier pattern would doubtless emerge if 1988 proves recession-free, as the consensus expects. But it's not the sort of consensus anyone should bet the ranch on. </TEXT></DOC>
