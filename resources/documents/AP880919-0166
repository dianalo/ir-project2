(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. marshals arrested a fugitive wanted ina hostage-taking at a newspaper office as he arrived Monday on aflight from Newark, N.J., with an attorney.   Marshals grabbed Eddie Hatcher and frisked him in the coveredpassageway connecting an arriving Piedmont Airlines plane to aterminal at Raleigh-Durham Airport. A security officer guarded thedoor to the terminal while marshals arrested Hatcher, handcuffedhim and led him to a car waiting on the tarmac.   Hatcher, whose hair had been cut shorter since his disappearancelast month, wore a bright red shirt, blue jeans, long breech clothand Indian-style boots.   He is charged with violating federal weapons laws and holding upto 20 people hostage at The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton onFeb. 1. Hatcher, who is American Indian, and a second man chargedin the incident said they were protesting alleged corruption anddiscrimination against minorities by Robeson County law enforcementofficials.   Hatcher's arraignment had been scheduled for Monday, and hisbrother and sister, Aaron and Ginger Clark, were waiting at theairport with a limousine. They said they had planned to take theirbrother to the federal courthouse in downtown Raleigh for thehearing.   However, authorities were watching the flights coming intoRaleigh-Durham and spotted Hatcher first, said U.S. Marshal BillBerryhill.   ``We felt like with his arraignment today he might come in,''said Berryhill.   The marshal said he was ``willing to give Hatcher the benefit ofthe doubt,'' and believed he was on his way to surrender when hestepped off the plane at the airport.   New York attorney Ron Kuby had accompanied Hatcher on the flightfrom Newark. Kuby is an associate of lawyer William Kunstler,well-known for his defense of left-wing activists.   Ms. Clark watched through a window as officials led her brotherout of the plane and down a stairway to the waiting car. Shesobbed, pounded on the window and waved in an attempt to get herbrother's attention. Hatcher looked up and smiled at her.   Hatcher was taken to the Cumberland County Jail in Fayetteville,one county over from Robeson in southeastern North Carolina,Berryhill said.   Upon his arrival in Fayetteville, Hatcher was asked where he hadbeen. He replied: ``Over the rainbow. I had a vacation. I feel realgood. It's time to overthrow the government.''   While Hatcher was being taken into custody, his case was calledby U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle. The judge entered aninnocent plea on Hatcher's behalf and set trial for Sept. 26.   Hatcher, 30, disappeared Aug. 31 after the 4th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals revoked his bond. He was declared a fugitive afterfailing to surrender to U.S. marshals in Raleigh.   Asked where Hatcher had been hiding or if he had been in contactwith his lawyers while a fugitive, Barry Nakell, a Chapel Hillattorney who's helping represent Hatcher, said, ``I can't say.''   Berryhill said investigators would pursue information on whereHatcher has been during the past 20 days ``even though it's ratheracademic at this point.''   ``We'll be talking with Mr. Hatcher right away,'' the marshalsaid. ``And we'll be getting with the airlines to determine pointof departure, who bought the plane tickets and so on.''   U.S. Attorney Margaret Currin and Assistant U.S. Attorney JohnBruce would not comment on possible additional charges againstHatcher or others who may have helped him.   Timothy Jacobs, 20, who also is charged in the hostage-takingincident, surrendered to U.S. marshals in Asheville on Aug. 31.Jacobs was later transferred to the Wilson County Jail.   Bruce said Hatcher and Jacobs would be tried together since theywere indicted together and the cases had not been separated by ajudge.   Hatcher and Jacobs had been released on $100,000 unsecured bondJuly 5 after a three-judge panel of the appeals court ruled theyhad not been given a bond hearing within five days of their arrest,as required by law. But the full court voided that decision and setan Oct. 4 hearing on a prosecution motion challenging bond for thetwo men.</TEXT></DOC>
