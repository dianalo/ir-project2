Growth is now brisk. Many economists predict that theeconomy of the world's second most populous country willexpand 4.5% to 5% in the year ending March 31, 1991.</LP><TEXT>   But the economy faces acute problems: a worrying budgetdeficit, accelerating inflation and a big current-accountdeficit. Added to these are the age-old problems of povertyand unemployment, which haven't lessened with a decade ofhigher economic growth. Rising oil prices won't help.   The Singh government was hoping to tackle its internaleconomic problems by opening the economy further under apolicy of deregulating domestic industry, increasing exportsand, to a lesser extent, encouraging foreign investment. Butprogress has been halted by a series of crises that threatento tear apart the eight-month-old government.   &quot;This government is weak,&quot; says a New Delhi economist. &quot;Itcan fiddle around the edges, but it won't do anythingfundamental economically. Politically, it can't.&quot; If leftunrelieved, the strain on the economy could lead to a&quot;difficult period&quot; for India in the early 1990s, according toa World Bank report in June. And if the current governmentfalls, it is likely to be followed by similarly fractiouscoalition governments, resulting in inconsistent economicpolicies.   &quot;The country has entered a long-term period ofinstability,&quot; says Bhabani Sen Gupta, an analyst with theCenter for Policy Research, a local think tank.   There is one positive development: Some analysts think Mr.Singh's efforts to deregulate and open the economy, howeverstillborn, prove that the idea of liberalization has finallytaken root in India after four decades of a planned economyand state-sponsored socialism. &quot;There's near unanimity thatthis is the way to go,&quot; says S.L. Rao, director general ofthe National Council of Applied Economic Research.   But the question is whether politics will continue toobstruct true liberalization. The government's politicalproblems seem intractable. Mr. Singh's is a minoritygovernment, supported in Parliament by two parties outsidethe ruling coalition. Mr. Singh's Janata Dal isn't so much apolitical party as a hodge-podge of ambitious politicians,many of whom have their eyes on the prime minister's job.   Since May, discord has been evident among a group ofsenior ministers, centered on Devi Lal, Mr. Singh's76-year-old deputy prime minister and agriculture minister.In a recent published interview, Mr. Lal described Mr. Singhas &quot;simpleminded&quot; and &quot;a weakling.&quot; Last Wednesday, Mr. Singhfired Mr. Lal.   Such infighting has paralyzed the government. On theeconomic front, the intraparty disputes have wrecked severalgovernment initiatives, in particular the industrial policyannounced in late May. The policy ended licensingrequirements for domestic industrial investments of less than$14 million, with a higher threshold of $43 million forbackward regions. The program also promised automaticclearance for imports of capital goods and raw materials, upto certain limits.   And the policy promised automatic approval for investmentsin which a foreign partner held 40% equity or less, whichwould have ended the lengthy, case-by-case approvals requiredin the past. Even more important was the government'sdecision to end the requirement that foreign investors exportas recompense for the money they made on the local market.   At the same time, the policy reaffirmed the 40% equitylimit for foreigners, which turns many investors away. Totalforeign investment approved in 1989 was a scant $195 million.   Foreign embassies and pro-liberalization analysts weren'timpressed with the policy but said it at least showed thatthe government favored a more-open economy. But in March, theSingh government rejected an investment application fromCoca-Cola Co. and &quot;re-examined&quot; an investment by PepsiCo Inc.Mr. Singh said India would accept only the kinds of foreigninvestments it desired.   Within Mr. Singh's fractious cabinet, the new industrialpolicy set off political fires. Mr. Lal and others criticizedit, saying the policy favored industry over farmers. Otherssaid it went against the country's commitment to socialism.   Owing to these political pressures, much of the industrialpolicy has been put on hold. Automatic approval of foreigninvestments has been retracted: The government says it willcompose a list of industries in which automatic approval willbe given. Economic analysts wonder if other parts will beimplemented, as well as more recent deregulatory measures,such as new incentives for private business to put up steelplants.   Economists argue whether Mr. Singh is a committed&quot;liberalizer,&quot; or simply a politician using liberalization tosolve shortterm problems. But one point is clear: Theliberalizers dominate economic discussion in India.Dissenters in the government can hinder new programs, butthey have few fresh ideas of their own.</TEXT></DOC>
