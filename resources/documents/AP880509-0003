First, the Senate will begin work on the military budget, anannual fight which generally involves wide-ranging decisions onAmerica's far-flung commitments.   The bill approved by the Senate Armed Services Committeeauthorizes $299.5 billion for the Pentagon, and targets increasedspending for non-nuclear weapons in the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization.   ``This issue of conventional weapons in NATO is something thatwe paid an awful lot of attention to this year, given the treaty,''said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the panel.   He was referring to the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treatysigned Dec. 8 by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev.   It eliminates both nations' medium-range missiles, and Nunn andother supporters say NATO's non-nuclear defenses will have to bebolstered after the missiles are gone.   The Senate is tentatively scheduled to begin work on the treatyWednesday.   During the Pentagon bill debate, amendments are likely both toincrease spending for NATO and call on U.S. allies in the 16-nationalliance to pay more of NATO's costs.   Also expected are proposals providing advice to Reagan from bothconservative Republicans and liberal Democrats about the armscontrol policies he should follow in the last six months of hisadministration.   Similar attempts were made the past two weeks in the Houseduring that chamber's work on its version of the Pentagon budgetbill. The House approved nuclear arms control restrictions opposedby the administration, along with cuts in Star Wars missile defensespending which were so deep that Defense Secretary Frank Carluccithreatened to advise Reagan to veto the bill.   The House is expected to give final approval Wednesday to itsPentagon bill. Similar action by the Senate will send the separatemeasures to a House-Senate conference committee to reconcile thedifferences.   Both measures propose $299.5 billion for the Pentagon in thefiscal year starting Oct. 1. One difference is that the House voted$3.5 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars isformally known, while the Senate bill proposes $4.6 billion. Reaganwanted $4.8 billion.   The House also voted to order Reagan to send the military intothe fight against illegal drug traffickers. Anti-drug amendmentsare likely in the Senate although not as sweeping as the Houseproposal, Nunn said.   In mid-week, the Senate is scheduled to turn to the INF pact,which Reagan wants ratified before he goes to the Soviet Union onMay 29 for his fourth summit meeting with Gorbachev.   With 67 votes needed for ratification, Senate leaders havepredicted that 90 or more senators will vote to approve the pact.   But the debate over the treaty has been clouded by a disputeover whether both the United States and the Soviets agree onseveral points, such as the definition of ``weapons'' and whetherthe pact bans ``futuristic'' weapons such as lasers.   There also are questions about the latitude which will beallowed U.S. inspectors who will be stationed inside the SovietUnion to verify compliance.   While the focus on the Senate floor is on national securityissues, congressional leaders also are preparing to send Reagan theomnibus trade bill.   The measure has been passed by both the House and the Senate butinstead of being sent to the White House, it remains stalled onCapitol Hill while leaders seek to revise it and perhaps avert athreatened presidential veto.   Last week, the House voted 253-159 to drop the bill's curbs onexport of Alaska oil, one of two provisions Reagan has said wouldjustify a veto. The other is a requirement that companies with 100employees or more give 60 days' notice of plant closings and largelayoffs.   The measure approved by the House is a technical resolution.Senate leaders still are trying to get the technical resolutiononto the floor without undue delay. If they cannot, they probablywill abandon plans to drop the Alaska provisions and just send thebill to Reagan unchanged from the form in which it won finalpassage two weeks ago.</TEXT></DOC>
