The shopping list ranges fromadvanced combat aircraft to experimental missile technologyand an apparent attempt to join the ranks of nuclear-armednations. All this from a nation that still hasn't signed apeace treaty with Iran, that remains technically at war withIsrael, and that is playing out a long-term feud with Syriathrough proxies in Lebanon's civil war.   &quot;The lesson that Iraq learned as the {Gulf} war progressedwas that toughness paid,&quot; says a Western ambassador whoserved in Baghdad during the fighting. &quot;It didn't matter thatit used methods seen as ungentlemanly in the West -- itdidn't forfeit Western standing.&quot;   Iraq used chemical weapons against Iran and its ownKurdish citizens, raising little Western ire. It has a vaststockpile of such weapons, which it has threatened to use onIsrael if that state launches a strike on Iraq's militaryindustries.   &quot;If an insect tries to advance towards Iraq or wageaggression against it, we will cut its tail from the back,its head from the front and leave only its middle,&quot; Mr.Hussein recently declared, in an apparent reference toIsrael.   Iraq lobbed long-range missiles on civilian targets inIran and says it is developing a missile with a range of1,250 miles -- bringing all of its enemies within reach. Italso has more than 700 combat aircraft, including themost-recent Soviet fighter planes, according to Zeev Eytan, aspecialist on the Middle East's military balance at theJaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv. It wants tobuy the Mirage 2000, a plane comparable to the U.S. F-16.   In 1981, an Israeli air strike on an incomplete Iraqinuclear reactor stalled what may have been an early attemptto acquire nuclear weapons. However, Iraq still has enricheduranium supplied by France, and last month's British andU.S.-coordinated seizure of krytrons -- possible nucleardetonators -- indicates renewed efforts to build a nuclearbomb.   What a dictatorship on such a spree probably is trying todo is skirt international weapons-sales restrictions, saysJohn Simpson, an arms-control expert at the University ofSouthampton in England. &quot;If you can't get X, well then, buy Yand Z when it comes along,&quot; he says. Such an approach takesadvantage of sales competition among industrial countries,who aren't collaborating to prevent a prohibited system beingpieced together from a range of scattered parts.   Gerald Bull, an American ballistics expert with strongties to the arms trade, may have peddled his &quot;supergun&quot; tothe Iraqis as &quot;a prestige weapon&quot; -- the biggest, andsomething the West doesn't have, says Mr. Simpson. (On March22, Mr. Bull was shot five times outside his Brusselsapartment. His killer hasn't been found.)   Such a sales pitch would be particularly appealing toHussein Kamil, the Iraqi president's son-in-law and ministerin charge of the country's vast military industrialization.&quot;The more exotic the technology, the more Kamil isinterested,&quot; says a former state department official whofollows Iraqi affairs. &quot;If you take a character like {Gerald}Bull with a fixation . . . and put him together with HusseinKamil who seems to share this fascination with exotic weaponsand has the funding for it, it makes sense that you come upwith something like this&quot; enormous gun.   Avraham Bar-David, project manager for the Israeliartillery specialists, Soltam Ltd., says such a gun getsaround Israel's air superiority, is simpler than missiletechnology and easier to protect.   While such a gun clearly would be immobile, much of itwould be concealed below ground and wouldn't require thecumbersome pre-launch preparation that gives a target nationwarning of an impending missile attack. Loaded with achemical or nuclear warhead, a single firing could do vastdamage.   Asked how a country could defend against such a weapon,Mr. Bar-David replies: &quot;Prevent it being installed.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
