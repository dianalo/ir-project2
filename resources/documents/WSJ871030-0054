The Composite Index of the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations system rose 5.2% to 307.1. But while it outpaced the Dow Jones Industrial Average yesterday, the index of OTC composite prices was held back by the big financial stocks, which rose more modestly yesterday than most large industrial issues. Nasdaq's National Market System Industrial Index, which excludes financial issues and some smaller stocks, jumped 7.2%.    Prices of many big technology stocks that had begun to recover Wednesday soared yesterday on strong volume. The price of Apple Computer rose 18%, or 6, to 39 1/2; Sun Microsystems leaped 26% to 31 3/4, a gain of 6 1/2; and Microsoft rose 16%, or 6 1/2 a share, to 47 3/4.    But price movement wasn't limited to technology issues: Yesterday's buyers were picking up shares of nearly all the giant institutionally traded Nasdaq issues. The kinds of issues posting gains ranged from Charming Shoppes, a big woman's wear retailer, which had an increase of 1 5/8, or 11%, to 15 7/8, to MCI Communications, which had a gain of 1 1/8, or 14%, to 9 3/8.    Smaller stocks as a group fared less well. By and large, the institutional shoppers were passing them up. Prices of penny stocks with market values of $1 million or less, up through stocks as large as $75 million, were flat as a group. And prices of quite a few of the tiniest OTC issues continued to slide yesterday.    But asset managers in their buying sprees yesterday did go after a number of specific middle-sized OTC stocks in the $75 million and up value range, where prices of dozens jumped even more than those of the best-performing giants.    Among the middle-sized computer stocks, Adobe Systems, which makes software for a laser printer used in the new IBM system, jumped 4 3/4 to 19 1/2, a 32% one-day gain; among the middle-sized electronic components makers, Integrated Device Technologies rose 40%, or 4 1/4, to 14 3/4; Xicor was up 2 1/4 to 7 5/8, a 42% gain, and Perception Technology was up 1 1/2 to 5, a jump of 43%.    Bargain-hunting institutions say they are cherry-picking among issues of this size, going after stocks that have very specific criteria. They say they want issues that have been depressed in the crash for reasons unrelated to the company.    According to Raymond Godfrey, managing director of Needham andamp; Co., an institutional research firm for OTC stocks, these investors are looking for stocks that are in industries with favorable trends, that have strong product positions, good momentum in quarterly sales and earnings, with no past lack of credibility, that have strong balance sheets that don't demand outside financing.    &quot;Investors are looking at fundamentals right now, multiples including price-to-cash and price-to-book value,&quot; he says, adding, &quot;through the bull market, investors talked about investing this way; these institutions are now doing it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
