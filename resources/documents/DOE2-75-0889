It is based on experimental results publishedin the literature and on the author's own research carried out in collaborationwith O and K Orenstein and Koppel A.G., Ennigerloh. With the experimentalresults assembled in this way it is possible, in a relatively simplemanner, to employ computers for designing cyclone separators. The effectof wall roughness and the size of the effective frictional surface areareceive particular attention. The conicity of the separating chamberis incorporated in the procedure by the definition of a so-called hydraulicradius.</TEXT></DOC>
