This alpha emitting radioactive elementcan bind thiols and thiol-containing proteins in vivo. Since thiol-containingchelating agents compete with many thiols for heavy metals, a numberof these chelating agents have been investigated as protective agentsagainst the lethal effects of {sup 210}Po and as tissue decorporatingagents for it. Rats given {sup 210}Po (40 microCi/kg) ip had a mediansurvival time (mst) of 39 days. The mst was increased to 106 days whenN-(2,3-dimercaptopropyl)phthalamidic acid (DMPA), meso-dimercaptosuccinicacid (DMSA) or the Na salt of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS)was administered sc (p less than .002). Decorporation studies were performedby giving rats {sup 210}Po (0.4 microCi) sc, followed by a series ofthiol injections beginning one hour later. After 21 days, kidney levelsof {sup 210}Po in rats given DMPA were only 28% of those of the untreatedcontrols and significantly lower than those receiving DMSA, DMPS, N-acetyl-L-cysteine,or WR2721. After DMPA treatment, the {sup 210}Po levels of the spleenwere 25% of the saline-treated control. DMPA appears to be a new andconsistent decorporating agent for polonium-210.</TEXT></DOC>
