The clean-air bill, approved 401-21 last night, now goesto what may be a long and contentious conference with theSenate, which approved its clean-air bill last month. Amongother differences, the Senate measure doesn't contain aworker-aid package.</LP><TEXT>   Nevertheless, Congress seems all but certain to approvethe first clean-air bill since 1977. The legislation wouldimpose the nation's first controls on acid rain, which ishurting lakes and forests in the Northeast; would reduce thetoxic emissions from chemical companies and other factoriesthat are blamed for cancer and birth defects; and would takea new approach to cleaning up smog by tailoring deadlines tocities' pollution problems.   The House bill is slightly less costly than the Senatemeasure, which would impose $21.5 billion a year in costs onindustry when it is fully in effect.   Just before final passage, the House voted 405-15 tolaunch a pilot program in California in which the autoindustry would be required to produce cars capable of runningon nongasoline fuels such as natural gas and methanol. Theprogram would start in 1994 and result in the production of atotal 750,000 cars through 1997.   The compromise amendment, which also contains analternative-fuels program for fleet vehicles, reflected ahard-fought compromise between Rep. Henry Waxman (D.,Calif.), who originally sponsored an amendment requiring theproduction and sale of one million alternative-fuel carsannually, and Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the Energy andCommerce Committee chairman, who opposed any productionrequirement. However, neither man is committed to thecompromise through the conference.   The politics of the alternative-fuels compromise werelinked with the worker-assistance package. At one pointyesterday, industry opponents of the alternative-fuelsprogram were fearful that an angry White House Chief of StaffJohn Sununu would throw support to the environmentalists inretaliation for industry's support of the jobs program.   The five year unemployment-assistance program, offered byRep. Robert Wise (D., W.Va.) and approved 274-146, wouldprovide up to six months of additional unemployment insurancebenefits and up to two years of retraining assistance to anyworkers who lose their jobs or have their employmentsubstantially reduced as a result of the bill. To be eligiblefor the assistance, the workers would have to demonstratethat the law was an &quot;important contributing factor&quot; to thejob displacement.   In the Senate, a similar measure backed by Sen. RobertByrd (D., W.Va.), was narrowly defeated. Sen. Byrd's proposalwas more costly and would have given coal miners moregenerous benefits than other workers received.   The Bush administration issued the veto threat in a letterTuesday to House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) from Mr.Sununu and Environmental Protection Administrator WilliamReilly. It said the amendment would create &quot;a potentiallyopen-ended liability for the federal government&quot; becausethere would be no way to determine whether workers lost theirjobs because of the clean-air act or for another reason.   In floor action yesterday, the House also voted 239-180 totoughen warranty provisions for anti-pollution equipment.Under the amendment, auto makers would be required to provideeight-year, 80,000-mile warranties for catalytic convertersand electronic-diagnostic gear. For other equipment, thewarranties would be for two years or 24,000 miles. The changemade the House bill the same as the Senate's on this issue.   The lawmakers also unanimously agreed to speed up therequired phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicalsthat are depleting the Earth's protective ozone layer. Thischange also makes the bill conform closely to the Senate'sprovisions.   In addition, the House approved on voice vote a package ofamendments that were previously accepted by the Energy andCommerce Committee and House leaders. The provisions wouldrequire the use of cleaner gasoline in all cars in thenation's nine smoggiest areas, beginning in 1992 and wouldrequire the EPA to identify and regulate the source of hazein western national parks within two years.   Major provisions of the legislation are described below.                                                                                                          AUTOMOBILES: The House and Senate bills contain differenttriggers for determining whether to impose a second round ofcurbs on tailpipe emissions.   Both measures call for a mandatory initial round of cutstotaling 60% for nitrogen oxide and 40% for hydrocarbons;these reductions would be phased in starting with 1994 modelsin the House and with 1993 models in the Senate. The EPAestimates that this requirement would add $100 to the priceof a car.   Under the House measure, a second round of cuts -- halvingexhaust levels for the pollutants -- would be required for2003 model cars only if an EPA study decided they were neededand cost-effective. Under the Senate bill, this second roundwould be contingent on the nation's air quality.Specifically, it would automatically take effect if 12 ormore seriously polluted cities outside California don't meetEPA health standards by the end of 2001. The EPA estimatesthe second round would add $500 to the price of a car.   The House language is preferred by the industry and theBush administration.                                                                                                          UTILITIES: The House and Senate take slightly differentapproaches to dividing up &quot;pollution credits&quot; amongutilities.   Provisions in both measures aimed at curbing acid rainwould require the nation's utilities to reduce sulfur-dioxidepollution by 10 million tons a year from 1980 levels duringthe next decade and to maintain those reductions. Both billswould preserve the innovative trading system, proposed byPresident Bush, under which utilities that make extra-deepcuts in pollution would get credits they could keep or sellto other utilities that want to expand.   Each bill, however, makes its own adjustment with thesystem to dole out extra credits to help the dirtiestutilities pay their cleanup costs and to help other utilitiesin fast-growing areas, among other groups. The Housegenerates these extra credits in part by requiring slightlydeeper cuts from the large dirty utilities affected by thefirst phase of the legislation. The Senate speeds up thedeadline for each of the legislation's two phases by oneyear.   The United Mine Workers contends that the House bill wouldresult in the loss of 12,000 to 15,000 high-sulfurcoal-mining jobs, and that the Senate bill would result inthe loss of more than 15,000 jobs.   The House also would require the EPA to identify andregulate the source of haze in western national parks withintwo years. The Senate calls only for a study.                                                                                                          FUEL: The oil industry would have more flexibility underthe House bill in meeting requirements for cleaner-burningreformulated gasoline to be sold in the nation's ninesmoggiest areas.   To the dismay of the oil industry, which has lobbiedvigorously against the provisions, both bills would force allgasoline sold in these areas, starting in 1992, to be atleast as clean as that produced according to a governmentformula. The Senate would actually require that the fuel meeta specific oxygen content in each year; the House gives thecompanies more leeway.   In addition, both bills would would phase in analternative -- fuels program for fleets requiring the use ofnon-gasoline fuels such as compressed natural gas.                                                                                                          OTHER INDUSTRIES: The Senate threatens to force factoriesto close down if they can't adequately reduce cancer riskfrom their emissions, although it offers coke ovens a 30-yearexemption. The House contains no closing threat.   Both measures would junk a regulatory system that has setstandards on air emissions for only seven toxic chemicals in20 years. Instead, each bill would require a majority ofpolluting plants -- ranging from petrochemical plants to drycleaners -- to install this state-of-the-art technology over10 years; the goal would be to eliminate at least 2,200annual cancer deaths from toxic industrial emissions, whilealso reducing birth defects and respiratory diseases.   Under the House bill, which is generally preferred byenvironmentalists and industry, the EPA would then conduct arisk-assessment study and make recommendations to Congress.If Congress doesn't act, current-law provisions go intoeffect requiring nearby residents to be protected within anample margin of safety. The Senate measure adopts ahealth-based standard that would force a plant to close if itcouldn't reduce the cancer risk from its fumes to no morethan 1-in-10,000 for nearby residents. Congress could changethe standard after a risk-assessment study.   ---   David Rogers contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
