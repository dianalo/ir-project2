Between now and Feb. 18, when the state's wily voterstroop to town halls and community centers to cast the firstvotes of the presidential election, the candidates all mustestablish themselves as presidential. But each of them alsomust give late-deciding New Hampshire voters a reason to votefor them if they are to emerge from the pack and then becomeplausible challengers to President Bush in November.</LP><TEXT>   In this atmosphere, Jerry Brown must establish himself asmore than simply a critic of the political establishment,Bill Clinton must extract a message from his portfolio ofproposals and Tom Harkin must energize the liberal activistswho can have an important impact in Democratic primaries. Atthe same time, Bob Kerrey must project command of substantivequestions and Paul Tsongas must establish himself assomething more than a regional favorite son.   None of those is an easy task. &quot;These campaigns aren'twell developed at all right now,&quot; says Tom Schlesinger, apolitical scientist at New Hampshire's Plymouth StateCollege. &quot;They're still kind of half-floundering, feelingtheir way.&quot;   For four decades, no one has won the White House withoutfirst winning the New Hampshire primary. The stakes areespecially high this year: With money scarce, a campaign thatstumbles in New Hampshire may be out of the race entirely.   &quot;The whole game is to keep your balance,&quot; says GeorgeStephanopoulos, deputy campaign manager for Arkansas Gov.Clinton. &quot;You've got to compete in New Hampshire withoutlosing sight of the primaries to come.&quot;   As a result, the campaign is concentrated into a midwinterpolitical derby, where small events take on enormousimportance and where slight movements can be distorted intomassive trends. &quot;Any little glitch or quick maneuver and thesituation can turn upside down,&quot; says Jean Hennessey, aformer national committeewoman in New Hampshire.   Here are the major challenges facing each of thecontenders:                                                                                                          Jerry Brown. The former California governor is mounting aninsurgency based on his conviction that U.S. politics hasbeen corrupted by money and the influence of specialinterests. &quot;People agree with what he's saying, but he hasn'tshaken the idea that he's eccentric,&quot; says Wayne King, thestate Senate's Democratic whip.   So far, Mr. Brown has failed to go beyond his critique ofU.S. politics and develop positions for many of the importantissues facing the country. In the next several weeks, he mustgo beyond indicting the system to offering ways of changingit.   At the same time, Mr. Brown is the lone Democrat tochallenge Iowa Sen. Harkin in the Iowa caucuses. If he isserious about his effort in Iowa, the hardest thing will beto remain in the state and fight to beat out &quot;uncommitted&quot;for second place. &quot;Staying focused and committed to an Iowastrategy will require incredible discipline,&quot; says MichaelMcCurry, a strategist for Sen. Kerrey of Nebraska.                                                                                                          Bill Clinton. The five-term Arkansas governor clearly hasthe momentum, both nationally and in New Hampshire, and hasmade few missteps. He has excelled at the big things and atthe little. Not long ago, he listened to some prominentDemocrats in Claremont, N.H., complain about economicconditions in the western part of the state and thensuggested a few people to contact for help; his gesture islikely to lead to as many as 50 new jobs in the area -- andsupport in the primary.   But in the white-paper blizzard of proposals and programsthat he has developed, Mr. Clinton still hasn't distilled adiscrete, thematic message. And though he conceived of hiscandidacy as a middle-class crusade, the campaign has becomeso cautious that there's little of the crusading feelingleft.   The candidate isn't likely to be able to ride above thestorm forever. &quot;People up here are not going to let him getaway with running a mini-Rose Garden strategy,&quot; says NedHelms, a former state Democratic chairman. Mr. Clinton mustprove to Democrats that he can take the political assaultthat almost surely is coming his way; some of the firstpunches may come as early as Sunday night, when the fivecandidates take part in a televised debate in Manchester.   Mr. Clinton and his strategists must decide, moreover,whether they want to pursue a nationwide strategy or returnto their original plan, which was to be a campaign with aSouthern base but with sufficient strength to make theoccasional successful Northern foray. The decision hasimportant implications. The problem with accepting the roleof national front-runner is that Mr. Clinton will have to wineverywhere -- so there will be landmines strewn across thecountry, in Maine, South Dakota, Colorado and elsewhere.                                                                                                          Tom Harkin. With his traditional Democratic messagecontaining trace elements of protectionism and class warfare,the Iowan has to convince the old-line Democraticorganizations and unions that are his natural constituencythat he can win. A lot of them joined the Harkin effort earlyin New Hampshire, but many of their associates have held backand Mr. Harkin has been unable to build a strongorganization. &quot;He hasn't seemed to catch on and no one knowsexactly why,&quot; says Michael Pignatelli, a Concord lawyerprominent in Democratic politics.   Mr. Harkin's biggest challenge is to transform thecharacter of the race, giving it an ideological edge thatwill mobilize the activists he has already signed up andattract the others who have hesitated. Mr. Harkin wasexpected to profit from New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's decisionnot to run, but he hasn't thus far. And though many unionorganizations favor Mr. Harkin from the heart, they areheeding their heads and siding with Mr. Clinton -- one of thebiggest mysteries of the campaign thus far. &quot;People likehim,&quot; state Rep. Peter Burling, the Sullivan CountyDemocratic chairman, says of Mr. Harkin, &quot;but there's theappearance that there isn't a new idea there, and everybodythinks we need to come up with new ideas.&quot;                                                                                                          Bob Kerrey. The Nebraska senator has assembled the mostimpressive national campaign staff and has attracted astunning array of promising young Democrats in New Hampshire:Joe Keefe, who mounted a strong but unsuccessful House racein 1990; Will Kanteres, a Manchester activist; Judy Reardon,a public defender and former state representative; and JeanneShaheen, a powerful state senator from the seacoast region.   But the quality of the candidate hasn't yet matched thequality of the campaign. Mr. Kerrey has been criticized forvagueness, a malady that he hasn't completely purged from hiscampaign. &quot;He speaks of a desire to lead a new generation,&quot;says Robert Arsenault, a Dartmouth College expert onpresidential campaigns, &quot;but he hasn't shown he can do ityet.&quot;   Though he seems to have taken steps toward pulling hiscampaign message together, he now faces the question ofwhether he will have the resources to project his ideas. Hisfund-raising was flat until the Dec. 15 debate on NBC, wherehe showed strength and intelligence. Since the holidays,fund-raising has picked up to the point that he was able tosurprise the Clinton forces with a television ad the dayafter the Arkansan began his broadcast assault.                                                                                                          Paul Tsongas. The former Massachusetts senator has wonsupport for his economic prescriptions and for a planspecifically tailored to a Granite State audience --including a New Hampshire venture-capital fund, science andbiotechnology parks close to the University of New Hampshireand Dartmouth College, and an overhaul of the state'sdirector-liability regulations.   But Mr. Tsongas must convince these New Hampshire votersthat he is a serious national candidate and not just aregional one. Massachusetts's proximity to New Hampshireworked to Michael Dukakis's advantage four years ago, butunlike Mr. Dukakis, Mr. Tsongas has no strategy to takeadvantage of any boost he receives in New Hampshire.   He doesn't have the public appeal of Mr. Clinton or Mr.Kerrey, drawing instead on what strategists for former Gov.Bruce Babbitt of Arizona used to call the &quot;charisma ofcompetence.&quot; That has only a modest track record inpresidential politics, however. &quot;If Tsongas were running forsecretary of commerce,&quot; says Mr. Burling, the Sullivan Countychairman, &quot;we'd all vote for him.&quot;   ---                Will the Circle Be Unbroken?
