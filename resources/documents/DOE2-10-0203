It allows English languagequery, report formatting, and data updates to Rdb/VMS relational databases.INTELLECT translates English requests into database commands, and allowsnon-technical users to perform a variety of retrieval and processingtasks for decision support or data maintenance using conversational English.The heart of an INTELLECT application is the lexicon, a dictionary ofcommon English words. Initially, the INTELLECT lexicon has about 400basic words.

The database, which consists of waste stream characterizationand waste management practice information for solid low-level radioactivewastes generated at the three Department of Energy plants in Oak Ridge,is used in disposal resource development and alternatives evaluation.An account of our experience using INTELLECT with the low-level wastemanagement database is given, including the process of lexicon building.The usefulness of the natural language interface in this context is discussed.13 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
