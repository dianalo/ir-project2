Resultsof sensitivity determination on isotope source in the process of detectorcooling are presented. Excess of this sensitivity over the calculatedone is obtained. Method of sensitivity determination in pulse regimeusing linear electron accelerator is suggested; correspondence betweenthe obtained and calculated data is shown. Results of calculations andexperiments on determination of detector time resolution are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
