The runup in oil prices also helped trim losses in stock-indexfutures, which moved steadily lower early Wednesday because of therelease of a barrage of anti-inflationary news from the federalgovernment.   On other markets, livestock and pork futures were mixed, wheatfutures were mostly higher and soybean and corn futures were lower.   The advances in oil came on a third day of frenzied activity atthe New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude lost 9 cents in the spotmonth Monday and 40 cents Tuesday as traders awaited word from OPECPresident Rilwanu Lukman on when the pricing committee would meet.   Oil opened under pressure again Wednesday, but rose when Lukmanfinally announced the regularly scheduled meeting would take placein April. It surged 58 cents during one early afternoon stretch tothe day's high of $16.96 a barrel after Saudi Arabia endorsed theOPEC gathering.   ``When anyone else says that, the market takes it with a grainof salt,'' said Bob Murphy, analyst with E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., NewYork. ``But when the Saudis do it, especially since they've beenmaking noises recently about discounting their own product, theimpact was almost immediate.   ``You could almost feel the psychology changing,'' he added.   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 38 cents to 49 centshigher, with the May contract for delivery at $16.86 a barrel;heating oil was 1.32 cents to 1.54 cents higher, with April at47.73 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .93 cent to 1.30cents higher, with April at 47.25 cents a gallon.   The precious metals opened higher Wednesday, but flounderedafter the government released a pair of new economic reports _ amodest 0.2 percent rise in consumer prices last month; a revised4.8 percent economic growth rate in the last quarter of last year.   ``Once inflation concerns stabilized, everything stagnated,''said Bette Raptopolous, analyst with Purdential Bache SecuritiesInc. in New York. ``But Lukman's announcement touched off a rally.The perception is higher oil prices means inflation, and thatconfirmed other indicators people have been seeing.''   Gold settled $2.40 to $3.30 higher on the New York CommodityExchange, with March at $451.10 a troy ounce; silver climbed 14.5cents to 15.6 cents, with March at $6.61 a troy ounce. Platinumadvanced for the third straight day, settling $3.10 to $3.40higher, with March at $513.50 a troy ounce.   Stock-index futures settled .25 point lower on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of theStandard andamp; Poors 500 index settled at 270.40. The underlying spotindex climbed .07 point, closing at 268.91.   ``We broke down to Tuesday's lows early in the day, but the factthat we didn't break them might have been one signal of strength,''said John Mitchell, a broker with Elders Futures Inc., Chicago.   ``Then, the oil news touched off a rally in interest-ratefutures and we moved up alongside,'' he added.   Wheat futures prices climbed on the Chicago Board of Trade onnews the Soviet Union would take delivery of 500,000 metric tons ofwheat under the government's export bonus program, as well as anoffer extended to Poland under the same program.   But the bullish news was tempered when Candamp;D Commodities, themajor player in the grains pits the two previous days, sold off itswheat supplies.   ``There is a feeling their big buys in recent days to covershort positions is over,'' said one analyst.   Candamp;D's selloff in the bean pit added pressure to a market thatwas already losing steam on expectations of decreased exports. Withrival producer Brazil in mid-harvest, traders feared some of theU.S. bean business will be taken away.
