Gunshots and tear gas were fired before he gave up, adomestic news service said today.   Police exchanged gunfire with Jose Antonio Zorrilla Perez outsidehis home and one officer was wounded, the Excelsior news servicereported.   Authorities had issued a warrant Sunday for Zorrilla's arrest inthe fatal shooting of Manuel Buendia, a vocal critic of corruptionin government. No formal charges or details on a court hearing hadbeen announced by early today.   Police called for reinforcements and soon more than 70 uniformedofficers and about 50 vehicles surrounded the residence.   Local news reports said District Attorney Ignacios MoralesLechuga arrived about a half hour later and the men talked insidethe residence before Zorrilla gave up.   Morales Lechuga said in a statement that he met with Zorrilla anddrove him to Morales' office, where he was arrested. He did notmention the confrontation.   The government news agency Notimex said Juventino Prado, acommander with the Mexico City Police Department's intelligencedivision and a former lieutenant under Zorrilla, was hospitalized onTuesday with a nervous breakdown.   According to investigators in the case, Prado accompaniedZorrilla when he arrived at the scene within minutes of the May 30,1984, shooting, Notimex said.   From 1981 to mid-1984, the 49-year-old Zorrilla headed theFederal Security Department, a now defunct agency that was similiarto the FBI.   In an interview on television Monday night, Morales Lechuga hadidentified Buendia as the ``intellectual author'' of the slaying.Authorities have refused to comment on a possible motive.   Lechuga has said officials have identified the person who pulledthe trigger, but that naming the gunman would hurt theinvestigation. No other arrests have been mentioned in the case.   Authorities on Sunday began a nationwide manhunt for Zorrilla andbrought in Interpol, the international police agency.   Buendia, a front-page columnist for the newspaper Excelsior andthe author of several books that tackled sensitive targets likeofficial corruption, drug and weapons trafficking and the CIA, wasgunned down in a downtown parking garage.   Zorrilla has long been suspected of concealing evidence andintimidating witnesses.   In May, Proceso magazine published an extensive report on thecase that said the Union of Democratic Journalists had evidence thatZorrilla's agents had been following Buendia for more than threemonths before his death.   Zorrilla met with Buendia three times in the month before theslaying, including the night before the fatal shooting, Proceso said.   Authorities declined to say what motive Zorrilla might have hadfor wanting to have Buendia killed.   Zorrilla has also been mentioned in news reports in connectionwith the deaths of three policemen and an investigator.   He was suspended from the security post in mid-1984 and thegoverning Institutional Revolutionary Party dropped him as acongressional candidate in 1985 amid reports that he was underinvestigation.   Before taking over the Federal Security Department, Zorrilla wasa former congressman and private secretary to Fernando GutierrezBarrios, deputy interior secretary at the time. Gutierrez Barrios isnow interior secretary. There has been intense pressure on thegovernment to solve the murder of Buendia, one of more than a scoreof journalists slain between 1982 and 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
