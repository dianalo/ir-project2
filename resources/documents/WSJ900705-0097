Thepostwar baby boom has ended. A woman reaching childbearingage in 1960 would expect 3.6 children; in 1990, only 1.9. I'malways a little nervous talking about six-tenths of a childor even nine-tenths of one, but that's the way demographyworks.   Demographers, economists and a lot of politicians havebeen worrying for several years about the burdens this olderpopulation will inflict on America -- particularly on thepost-baby boom generation. Those who pay Social Securitytaxes will be decreasing in numbers and the baby boomers willbe sliding into retirement.</LP><TEXT>   In the past decade this raised fears for the future of theSocial Security system. Keeping the system going, and keepingthe checks flowing, might require such large tax increasesthat workers would rebel. There was no sign of imminentrebellion, but the average American usually doesn't know whatdemographers have in mind. In any case, the perceived problemled the government to appoint a commission to study thematter and propose solutions.   Before long there was a schedule of higher Social Securitytaxes. For the next 30 years tax payments are slated toexceed benefits, with the surplus piling up in a trust fund.After 2020 the fund would be drawn down as the populationaged. There has been a great deal of concern that Americansaren't saving enough, but through the tax system the publicis saving, whether it wants to or not.   Now at hand, however, is a study by four economists, DavidCutler and James Poterba of MIT and Louise Sheiner andLawrence Summers of Harvard, that suggests we may haveworried too much about the after-effects of the baby boom.   For one thing, the end of the baby boom means not onlymore old folks but -- guess what? -- fewer babies. Thedecline in the number of dependent children, moreover, willcome before the surge in the number of dependent elderly.Furthermore, the fraction of the labor force either at ornear peak productivity will increase. Between 2010 and 2060,the total work force will decrease slightly, making itpossible to reduce investment without reducing capitalinvestment per worker.   All in all, the authors suggest, a declining work forcemay be good for productivity. They offer a study of 29countries in the years 1960-85. Over that period, thecountries with slow labor-force growth had above averageproductivity growth. The authors don't claim this analysis isany more than a theory, but it does make sense. Afast-growing labor force normally has lots of very youngworkers, short on training as well as experience.   In addition to helping to care for dependent children andthe elderly, savings are supposed to fuel the investment thatprovides jobs and keeps the economy growing. During thelow-savings 1980s, this gap was largely filled by investmentfrom abroad. There has been some concern that this inflowwill diminish, making it necessary to generate more domesticsavings, but the MIT-Harvard economists are optimistic. Theynote that in other countries, notably Japan and West Germany,the populations will age faster and the work forces will growmore slowly than in the U.S., so other nations are likely tocontinue to seek investment opportunities in the U.S.   Finally, the economists note that one argument forreducing the federal budget deficit is that it would increasenational saving. There are arguments for reducing thedeficits; otherwise, all of those congressmen andadministration officials wouldn't be bothering with all ofthose current meetings in Washington. But demography does notdictate a budget reduction, at least not immediately. Overthe next three decades, in fact, the gradual aging of thepopulation is likely to lead to higher rates of personalsaving. A few months do not a trend make, of course, but thesaving rate last year bounced up to 6%.   The MIT-Harvard economists don't come right out and attackthe Social Security trust fund, but their analysis surelydamages some of the arguments for the big fund buildup. A keyargument is that, without the buildup, the post-boom workerswill be faced by big tax increases to pay benefits to theboom generation's retirees, a result that the Social Securityplanners obviously found to be unfair.   The MIT-Harvard authors, however, believe that the boomgeneration deserves some special treatment. During theirworking years, wage growth is slow because of lowcapital-labor ratios. During their retirement years, thenumber of potential purchasers of capital will fall, reducingthe rate of return on savings. Studies suggest a sharpdecline in the inflation-adjusted prices of houses, causing asubstantial transfer of wealth to people who are now veryyoung.   At the same time, as noted, productivity is likely to begrowing, which should mean that the post-boom generation willbe more affluent than its predecessors. There may bearguments for piling up that Social Security surplus, butfairness to the postboomers isn't the most persuasive one.   Some population scholars argue that it would be nice if wecould get another baby boom going to spread the burden ofcaring for the growing numbers of elderly. The authors arguestrongly against such an approach: &quot;Dependency at thebeginning of the life cycle is between 50% and 100% as costlyas dependency at the end of the life cycle. It also comes 60years earlier.&quot;   In sum, the aging of America presents some problems. It'snice to know, though, that it also offers us someopportunities.</TEXT></DOC>
