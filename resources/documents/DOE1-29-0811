Bothcases, i.e. when the strip is going to collect the generated charge andwhen it does not, are evaluated. A new method to calculate these pulsesis presented. It is based upon the theorem of Tellegen, by which it isshown that the current induced in a detector strip can be calculatedby scaling the currents flowing inside the detector (resulting from themovement of the generated charges) by a reference field and then integratingthese weighted currents. This field - determined separately - dependssolely on the geometry of the detector. Its generality makes the methodapplicable to other induction problems as well.</TEXT></DOC>
