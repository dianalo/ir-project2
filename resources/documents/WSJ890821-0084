Both developments involve research on a strange protein, called beta-amyloid, that accumulates in the brains of persons with Alzheimer's disease. The protein's role in the disease isn't known but the number of amyloid-containing lesions in the brain seem to correlate with the disease's severity.    Two collaborating research teams -- at the University of Rochester (N.Y.) Medical Center and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston -- have now developed a monoclonal antibody that they hope will detect the beta-amyloid protein in Alzheimer's patients, said Sayeeda Zain, who heads the University of Rochester team. She spoke Friday at a symposium in Rochester on molecular approaches to human disease.    The two research groups are in negotiations with an unidentified company to develop the antibody as a diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease, said Charles A. Marotta, the Harvard Medical School biologist who heads the research effort at McLean Hospital, the psychiatric facility for Massachusetts General Hospital.    &quot;At present there is no biological assay for Alzheimer's disease,&quot; Mr. Marotta explained. The disease, premature loss of memory, senility and dementia, is diagnosed primarily by psychological and neurological tests that measure changes in brain and mental functioning.    &quot;We developed the monoclonal antibody for research purposes&quot; but it also could be used for a diagnostic test, Mr. Marotta said. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced versions of the antibodies the body makes to fight off invasions of viruses, bacteria and other &quot;foreign&quot; matter. The antibodies latch on to proteins on the surfaces of the viruses and bacteria. Each line of the laboratory-made monoclonal antibodies is designed to seek out and latch on to a specific protein such as, in this case, the beta-amyloid protein.    The hope, Mr. Marotta said, is to attach radioactive tracer molecules to the amyloid antibody. The antibodies, upon being injected into a patient, would seek out beta-amyloid protein. A radiation-detecting camera could then tell whether the patient is producing abnormal amounts of beta-amyloid protein, a distinctive feature of Alzheimer's disease.    It isn't known whether the antibodies would be able to get from the blood into the brain and the amyloid-rich brain lesions. However, Mr. Marotta said, in Alzheimer's patients the beta-amyloid also accumulates in the blood vessels, where it would be readily accessible to the monoclonal antibodies. Clinical trials of the antibody diagnostic test would be done by the federal National Institute on Aging, which is funding the research, the scientist said.    Mr. Marotta and Ms. Zain also have cloned the amyloid protein gene and have transplanted it into cells grown in a test tube. This line of cells is now producing excessive quantities of beta-amyloid protein, also known as A4 peptide. As a result, the cells &quot;become a very interesting model&quot; for studying the over-production of the protein in Alzheimer's disease, Mr. Marotta said.    The amyloid-producing cells also can be used to design and screen chemicals to find those that might interrupt the outpouring of the protein, the scientist said. If found, such drugs wouldn't cure the disease but &quot;they may help keep it from getting worse&quot; since the accumulation of the protein and the destruction of brain cells seem to go hand-in-hand, he explained. &quot;There's a lot of interest from commercial companies&quot; in using the amyloid-producing cells for such drug screening and &quot;negotiations are on-going,&quot; Mr. Marotta said.    Ms. Zain said efforts now are under way to transplant the human amyloid gene into mice, producing a strain of so-called transgenic mice that could be used for developing and testing treatments for Alzheimer's disease. </TEXT></DOC>
