 The company's areas of expertiselie in its integrated voice and high-speed data (ISDN) and LAN technologies.andO;Its products include an integrated voice and high-speed data network, theDAVID Information Manager, which transmits information over telephone wiring,and a family of 10BASE-T-featured LAN products, including DAVID ExpressNetand DAVID Volksnet, which provide Ethernet local-area networking overunshielded twisted-pair telephone wiring.andM;Within the communications industry, DAVID addresses enhanced voice servicesfor the Centrex market; the traditional data communicationsapplication--terminal to host computer; and local- area networking (LANs) forpersonal computers and workstations.andP;  Committed to following industrystandards, DAVID Systems handles numerous protocols including 802.3 EthernetLAN (10BASE-T), RS- 232 asynchronous data, IBM 3270 data, and T1 andfiber-optic interfaces.andP;  Under development are additional media accessmethods such as token-ring LAN and ISDN products.andM;By handling multiple data applications, the DAVID-Manager provides a backbonefor an organization's information network.andP;  Use of existing telephone wiringas the transmission media can provide cost savings in both networkinstallation and on-going administration.andM;DAVID's patented technology allows simultaneous transmission of digitizedvoice, terminal data (both asynchronous and IBM 3270 communications),workstation data (i.e., personal computer LANs), and telephone signallingover in-place, telephone wiring.andP;  The company has taken this base oftechnology and packaged it in various forms to provide application formultiple, different markets.andP;  The most recent illustration is the DAVIDExpressNet Hub, intelligent concentrators, and associated products designedfor indirect distribution through the value-added reseller channel.andM;DAVID Information ManagerandM;The DAVID Information Manager is installed by attaching a DAVID- Manager--thenetwork's intelligent communications processor--to Centrex or other businessservices via a standard telephone interface.andP;  Integration of voice, data, andLAN takes place over the existing twisted-pair telephone wiring.andM;The DAVID-Manager sits between the host telephone system and the end-users'desktops equipped with either DAVID-Set telephones, data adapters, orEthernet adapters (token-ring in development).andP;  The host telephone systemcontinues to switch all voice transmissions, while the attached DAVID-Managerprovides enhanced voice services and handles data and LAN requirements.andM;With the DAVID Information Manager, each telephone outlet becomes a dataoutlet.andP;  Users can send information virtually anywhere, including to and frommainframe computers, host telephone systems, file and print servers, PCs,gateways to other networks, and to modems.andM;In addition to providing data communications, the Information Manager addsenhanced voice features through its digital multiline phones specificallydesigned to work with Centrex.andM;The DAVID Information Manager network adds enhanced voice features throughits digital multiline phones specifically designed to work with Centrex.andM;The DAVID Information Manager network can be expanded to accommodate growingneeds for data communications on an as-needed basis.andP;  The network's modular,distributed architecture facilitates additions, and a singleDAVID-Manager--the basic building block of the system--can be expandedthrough the addition of cards.andM;Expansion to the network is accomplished by linking DAVID- Managers.andO;Geographically dispersed DAVID LANs can be connected via fiber-optic cablingor T1 links providing LAN, Metropolitan Area Networking (MAN), and Wide-AreaNetworking (WAN).andP;  The distributed networks appear as a single network to theuser.andM;Voice FeaturesandM;The DAVID Information Manager can handle very large key system groups.andP;  Thesystem can be configured with virtually no limit as to lines, stations, andintercom groups.andP;  DAVID-Sets can accommo- date up to 16 lines and/or featuresand require one pair of wires.andP;  The system also supports analog telephonesets, providing a choice when key system functions are not required.andM;Users of the DAVID-Set telephone access features of the host telephonesystem, such as &quot;call waiting,&quot; by pushing a single button instead of usingcodes or the &quot;hook-flash.&quot;andP;  The system is designed according to familiarmultiline phone use patterns, to make it easier for users to learn to useDAVID phones.andM;To those of the host telephone system, DAVID adds its own features such asauto dial, message waiting indication, and built-in speaker phone.andP;  DAVID'snon-blocking intercom network can relieve the host telephone system oftraffic from internal calls.andP;  The DAVID-Set display provides special callprompts and the display of dialed numbers, intercom callers, time, and date.andM;Local-Area NetworkingandM;The DAVID Information Manager eliminates the need for coax cable runs.andO;Ethernet workstations are linked into the network through DAVID's EthernetDevice Adapters, which provide 1-Mbps packet data transmission over thetwisted-pair-telephone wiring.andP;  This connects to a 10-Mbps Ethernet backplanein the DAVID-Manager.andP;  Through an Ethernet interface, this backplane canconnect to other DAVID-Managers, or to an existing coax-based Ethernet LAN.andM;10BASE-T-featured Ethernet capability is also available on the DAVIDInformation Manager through either a 48- or 123-port configuration, providing10-Mbps connections from the workstation to the Information Manager.andP;  The10BASE-T modules are interoperable with existing Information Manager Ethernetconnections and networks.andM;Asynchronous Terminal DistributionandM;The DAVID-Manager switches data and allows a network of asynchronous dataterminals and mainframe or minicomputers to be distributed within a company.andO;Users can contend for host computer ports and access inward and outboundmodem pooling, and other networks such as X.25 packet networks, IBM 3270networks, and Telex/Twx messaging systems through protocol converters.andO;Features such as speed matching and flow control allow terminals tocommunicate with devices operating at different speeds without requiringsetting by the user.andM;To access the asynchronous network, adapters are added to the DAVID-Settelephone, providing an interface for RS-232 data at the user's desk.andP;  Theadapter sends and receives RS-232-C data over the circuit-switched channel ofthe DAVID-Link at speeds up to 19.2 Kbps.andM;For installations that do not require voice communications--such as terminalclusters or host computer ports--a Dual Asynchronous Adapter can be used.andO;This device provides two RS-232-C connections per device over a single pairof telephone wires.andM;IBM 3270 Coax EliminatorandM;DAVID 3270 Coax Eliminators link IBM 3270 display stations to IBM controlunits over standard twisted-pair telephone wiring instead of 3270 cable.andP;  The3270 connection is accomplished without any protocol intervention, allowingcommunications to proceed at full IBM 2.358-Mbps speed and performancelevels.andM;Ether-T AdaptersandM;DAVID Ether-T Adapters are a family of Ethernet 10BASE-T adapter boards forIBM and compatibles.andP;  The adapters establish LAN connections using ordinarytelephone wire.andP;  The adapters are said to meet the 10BASE-T specification forthis connection type and can interoperate with other adapters, hubs,concentrators, and equipment that also meet the IEEE 802.3 specificationand/or the same 10BASE-T specification.andM;DAVID Ether-T LANs are wired in a star configuration to a centrally locatedVolksNet Hub or DAVID ExpressNet Hub using unshielded twisted-pair (UTP)wire.andM;The popular network operating systems are supported by the DAVID Ether-TAdapters.andP;  Drivers are supplied with each Ether-T Adapter, including NovellNetWare 286 version 2.0a, 2.11, 2.12, and 2.15c; NetWare 386; and drivers forMicrosoft OS/2 LAN Manager.andP;  Drivers for TCP/IP are not supplied with thecards but are available as an option.andM;Ether-T PC AdapterandM;This adapter is designed for use in an IBM PC, XT, AT, PS/2 Model 30, orcompatible.andP;  It can be used in the file server or in a workstation.andP;  With 40Kbytes of RAM memory, the adapter provides sufficient buffers to handlenetwork traffic when utilized as a file server adapter; it can also be usedas a workstation adapter.andM;Four LED status lights on the adapter report the status of jabber, link test,receive, and transmit.andP;  The lights aid in network installation andtroubleshooting.andM;Ether-T AT AdapterandM;This adapter is designed for use in an IBM PC AT, PS/2 Model 30- 286, or ATcompatible; in addition, ISA standard 16-bit bus computers using the 80286 or80386 processors are also compatible with this adapter.andP;  Performance isachieved through efficient driver performance and the utilization of 64-KbyteRAM memory on board the adapter.andP;  The adapter is suited to either file serveruse or workstation operation.andP;  Four LED status lights on the adapter reportthe status of jabber, link test, receive, and transmit.andP;  Again, the lightsaid in network installation and trouble shooting.andM;DAVID TP-MAU AdapterandM;The DAVID twisted-pair media access unit converts existing coax cableadapters with AUI connections into &quot;10BASE-T-compliant&quot; LAN adapters.andP;  Shouldusers choose to convert to UTP wiring for some or all segments of an EthernetLAN, existing adapters or systems with built-in Ethernet interfaces can beconverted in the field with DAVID's TP-MAU adapters.andM;DAVID ExpressNetandM;The DAVID ExpressNet architecture includes hardware and software elementsdesigned to operate, monitor, and control a broad range of Ethernet networksfrom large company-wide installations to individual workgroups.andP;  Thearchitecture provides integrated in- and out-of-band network management, IEEE802.3 10BASE-T functionality, and conformance to Internet SNMP ( SimpleNetwork Management Protocol) network standards.andM;The DAVID ExpressNet system consists of a centrally located Hub and a smalladapter that is located at the computer workstation.andM;The DAVID ExpressNet Hub works as an IEEE 802.3 multiport retiming repeater.andO;It is very compact and can be mounted on the wall in a telephone wiringcloset.andP;  The Hub has 12 twisted-pair data link ports for workstations, astandard IEEE 802.3 AUI (Attachment Unit Interface) port, an RS-232-Cdiagnostic port, and 28 status LEDs.andM;The TP-MAU (Twisted-Pair Medium Attachment Unit) adapter connects to atwisted-pair data link using an 8-pin modular (RJ-45) connector.andP;  It connectsto a workstation, server, or other IEEE 802.3/Ethernet device using an AUIport.andP;  There is a switch on the TP-MAU to let users enable or disable the SQEfunction.andP;  Six LEDs display the status of the TP-MAU.andM;Maintenance, diagnostics, network monitoring, and physical-layer networkmanagement capabilities are built into each Hub.andM;A PC or terminal can be attached to the RS-232-C port to provide managementaccess and control.andP;  This can be done locally by direct attachment or via adata switch.andP;  Remote access is possible via a dial-up modem.andP;  By usingadditional equipment, groups of Hubs can be monitored from a remote siteusing only one modem and telephone line.andM;Hub features include IEEE 802.3 10BASE-T functionality, on-board physicallayer network diagnostics and control features, and simplified internalcircuitry incorporating a DAVID-designed ASIC chip.andP;  The DAVID ASIC is saidto represent the integrated equivalent of approximately 160,000 transistorsand give the hub a conservatively estimated mean time between failure (MTBF)of 57 years.andP;  Hubs are available as free-standing units or as modules forintegration in DAVID ExpressNet Intelligent Concentrators.andM;The diagnostics include Hub and port statistics, wiring polarity control,Link Integrity Test, and late-arriving collision monitor.andP;  Control functionsinclude the ability to individually disable or enable each link.andP;  Inaddition, 28 LEDs on the Hub and six LEDs on the TP-MAU give visualindication of status without use of a terminal.andP;  These features are said tomake installation, fault isolation, and network changes on a DAVID ExpressNetLAN easier than on a coax-based Ethernet network.andM;The DAVID ExpressNet Hub collects a full complement of statistics on aper-port and per-Hub basis.andP;  The statistics cover normal activity such asframe (packet) traffic and collisions, together with link and frame errors.andO;Several flags covering system events are also maintained.andM;Late collision arrival has been identified by the IEEE 802.3 System Topologygroup as an important way to detect misconfigured networks.andP;  The DAVIDExpressNet Hub detects late-arriving collisions.andM;A unique feature of DAVID ExpressNet Hub is the Name Service feature, whichallows users to assign names to ports and Hubs for more efficient management.andO;This service is provided at the physical layer without placing requirementson the network operating software.andM;The TP-MAU connects with any IEEE 802.3 device or plug-in board (includingall devices from all major manufacturers) via the AUI port.andP;  The Hub connectswith 802.3 10BASE5 (thick cable) and 10BASE2 (thin cable, or cheapernet)through the AUI and transceiver.andM;DAVID ExpressNet Intelligent Concentrators house up to four or eleven DAVIDExpressNet twisted-pair hub modules plus one DAVID ExpressNet Supervisormodule.andP;  Each concentrator can support up to 48 or 132 users, respectively,while allowing integrated physical layer monitoring, control, and managementof all stations connected to the hubs.andP;  The concentrators simplifyinstallation and management of DAVID ExpressNet in larger networks.andM;DAVID ExpressNet Supervisor Module, when installed in concentrator units,integrates physical layer network management of all hubs contained in theconcentrator.andM;Network Management and Control Software interfaces with DAVID ExpressNetSupervisor modules to allow in- and out-of-band physical layer management ofall links, hubs, and intelligent concentrators on a network.andP;  The DAVIDnetwork management scheme conforms to SNMP standards via the use of Agentmodules, facilitating LAN management in the context of an organization'soverall data communications resources.andM;The products maintain forward and backward compatibility with prior DAVIDSystems Ethernet LAN offerings, including DAVID ExpressNet Fiber-Optic Huband FO-MAU.andM;DAVID VolksNetandM;The DAVID VolksNet was introduced in February 1990 to address the needs ofthe small, standalone workgroup.andP;  This market segment (estimated to be worthover $500 million per year) is currently served by ARCNET and thin coaxialEthernet installations.andM;The DAVID VolksNet Hub (see Figure 1) works as an IEEE 802.3 multiportretiming repeater.andP;  It is compact and can be mounted on a table-top or on thewall in a telephone wiring closet.andP;  The Hub has 12 twisted-pair data linkports for workstations, a standard IEEE 802.3 AUI (Attachment Unit Interface)port, and 28 status LEDs.andM;The computer workstations may be connected to the network using 10BASE-TEthernet boards.andP;  If compatible boards with 10BASE-T interfaces are notavailable, the IEEE 802.3 standard AUI interface may be used:  in this case,a TP-MAU (Twisted-Pair Medium Attachment Unit) is connected between thecomputer and the twisted-pair wire.andM;The TP-MAU connects to a twisted-pair data link using an 8-pin modular(RJ-45) connector.andP;  It connects to a workstation, server, or other IEEE802.3/Ethernet device using an AUI port.andP;  There is a switch on the TP-MAU tolet a user enable or disable the SQE function.andP;  Six LEDs display the statusof the TP-MAU.andM;The DAVID VolksNet Hub has built-in microprocessor-based diagnostics.andP;  Thesediagnostics check the Hub and provide at-a- glance indication of problems onthe Hub's LEDs.andP;  These diagnostics detect problems with ROM, RAM, internalCPU, AUI power, repeater module, and internal power.andM;Problems with individual links are indicated by the Link Status LEDs.andP;  Thereis one Link Status LED per twisted-pair link.andM;The VolksNet Hub carries an LED for each twisted-pair link.andP;  The computeradapter board or TP-MAU also carries an LED.andP;  If both devices (Hub andcomputer) are powered-up, the LEDs will light if everything is in order.andM;DAVID VolksNet Hubs can be connected together to form larger networks usingtwisted-pair wiring.andP;  They can also be attached to other 802.3 Ethernetcables such as standard coax (10BASE5, yellow cable), thin cable (10BASE2,cheapernet), and optical fiber using off-the-shelf transceivers.andM;The Hub acts as a retiming repeater, so it can be configured in any waydefined by the IEEE 802.3 standard.andP;  DAVID VolksNet Hubs are compatible withDAVID ExpressNet and DAVID Information Manager architectures, allowingVolksNet Hubs to be integrated into large corporate and enterprise networks.andM;Several companies have announced 10BASE-T boards for personal computers.andO;Among those tested with VolksNet Hubs are boards from Racal Interlan, 3Com,and Western Digital.andP;  Specific models include:andM;- Racal Interlan NI5210-10BT, NI6510-10BT, NI9210-10BT andandM;MacConnect-10BTandM;- 3Com Etherlink II TPandM;- Western Digital EtherCard Plus 10T and EtherCard PlusandM;10T/AandM;DAVID Systems has designed DAVID VolksNet components to have the features ofthe 10BASE-T draft for transmitting 10-Mbps Ethernet on unshieldedtwisted-pair telephone wiring.andP;  DAVID Systems engineers participate in theactivities of several IEEE 802 committees, including the 10BASE-T Task Force.andO;The IEEE 802.3 10BASE-T Task Force is nearing completion of its work.andP;  Thework of the task force is expected to become a draft standard during 1990.andM;Major DAVID VolksNet features include:andM;- Link integrity testandM;- Intelligent squelchandM;- 5-volt peak-to-peak signallingandM;- Pre-equalizationandM;- Jabber function at Hub and TP-MAUandM;- Full IEEE 802.3 repeaterandM;- Auto partitionandM;- Twisted-pair to twisted-pair Hub connectionsandM;ConclusionandM;DAVID ExpressNet and DAVID VolksNet are marketed through a worldwide networkof system integrators, distributors, and original equipment manufacturers(OEMs).andP;  Companies include Ameritech Information System, (AIS), Pacific Bell,and Contel Business Systems.andM;Currently, DAVID is pinning high hopes on VolksNet, with ads touting its &quot;$99per connection&quot; cost.andP;  For more information, contact Brian MacLeod at DAVIDSystems, Inc., 701 East Evelyn Ave., Sunnyvale, CA 94086-6527; (408)720-8000.andP;  IntroductionandM;Thomas-Conrad Corporation, of Austin, TX, was founded in 1982 by a team ofengineering consultants who specialized in process control applications andcommunication technology.andP;  In an initial contract involving the developmentof a mainframe gateway package, Thomas-Conrad engineers designed its firstcommercial product, an 8-bit ARCNET adapter.andP;  The company's initial successwith the 8-bit adapter prompted it to develop a complete family of ARCNETproducts, including 16-bit ARCNET adapters in commercial volumes, and it alsodeveloped a generation of diagnostic hubs which made it possible to displayindividual node activity.andM;In 1988, Thomas-Conrad improved its diagnostic capabilities by introducingthe industry's first &quot;Smart Hub,&quot; an intelligent active hub that displayedinformation about network reconfigurations.andP;  Since the introduction of the&quot;Smart Hub,&quot; these features have become standard in the ARCNET industry.andP;  In1989, the firm added adapters for the Macintosh II series, SE, and SE/30 toits ARCNET product line.andP;  Most recently, it has extended its ARCNET driverline to support Novell's NetWare 386 for both client and server environmentsand their latest specification for accelerated drivers.andP;  These new driversoffer selectable packet sizes.andM;In 1989, Thomas-Conrad entered the Token-Ring marketplace.andP;  Its MultistationAccess Unit (MAU) featured on-board diagnostics, LED displays, and 16-portcapacity.andP;  Thomas-Conrad also developed a 4-Mbps 16-bit token-ring adapterwith bus master capability and assorted NetWare-based token-ring drivers.andM;Thomas-Conrad's first software diagnostic tool, TXD, started shipping in1989.andP;  This product was developed for Novell NetWare v2.1x and is topology-and media-independent.andP;  TXD provides network managers with detailedinformation about network behavior, performance, and errors which they canemploy to detect and correct hardware, software, or configuration problems.andM;TCNSandM;TCNS (the Thomas-Conrad Networking System) is an extension of existingtoken-passing LAN technologies, provides a 100-Mbps effective data rate, andrequires no new specialized software.andP;  The network employs many features ofARCNET.andP;  A TCNS LAN supports up to 255 nodes and packet sizes of up to 512bytes, has a network span of 20,000 feet, and supports up to 5,000 feetbetween devices.andP;  The LAN uses a distributed-star topology and connects withfiber-optic cabling.andP;  TCNS can be bridged to other protocols such as ARCNET,Ethernet, or token-ring in network operating systems that support internalbridging.andM;According to Thomas-Conrad, TCNS is a technology developed using thehigh-speed TAXI chip technology from Advanced Micro Devices and is optimizedfor volume, transaction-oriented applications that need to move huge amountsof data in a small amount of time.andP;  Applications particularly well-suited tobenefit from TCNS speed include those that use remote procedure calls,interprocess communications, perform large database queries, are graphics- orimaging-concentrated, or are transaction-oriented.andP;  Cooperative- processingenvironments can also use TCNS.andM;The TCNS family includes adapters for 16-bit AT and 32-bit EISA computers, an8-port diagnostic Smart Hub, and Thomas-Conrad's HubTalk, a Network HubManager.andP;  Thomas-Conrad plans include support for the XT and Micro Channelcomputers as well.andM;Thomas-Conrad Corporation will ship the ISA and EISA network interfaceadapters and hubs for TCNS in volume by the end of August.andP;  The initialdelivery of approximately 100 adapters is now underway to over 30 operationalsites.andM;TCNS is a 100-Mbps local-area network technology optimized for high-volumeand transaction-processing applications.andP;  The adapters are designed to workwith most popular network operating systems including Novell's NetWare,Banyan's VINES, Artisoft's LANTastic, and Performance Technology's POWERLan.andO;TCNS adapters require no software changes to existing ARCNET networks and use16 Kbytes of address space.andP;  The TCNS adapter drivers support multiple memoryaddress and IRQ options.andP;  Several network adapters, including TCNS, can beinternally bridged in a file server.andP;  The adapters, which use fiber-opticcable and ST-type connectors, operate under currently available Novell RX-Netdrivers or Thomas-Conrad's Accelerated ARCNET Drivers for NetWare.andP;  The TCNSadapters connect (except in peer-to-peer implementations) to the network viathe TCNS Smart Hub, a diagnostic hub that supports Thomas-Conrad's HubTalk, aNetwork Hub Manager.andM;TCNS Smart HubandM;The TCNS Smart Hub lets users implement a distributed-star topology for a100-Mbps TCNS local-area network.andM;This hub provides eight-port fiber-optic connectivity with ST- typeconnectors, plus troubleshooting or diagnostic control and monitoring foreach port connected to the hub.andP;  LEDs, digital displays, and a keypadfacilitate control and monitoring operations.andP;  The LEDs reflect each port'sstatus and activity, the displays record reconfiguration activity, and thekeypad lets users enable or disable individual ports as required.andM;In addition, the TCNS Smart Hub uses Thomas-Conrad's HubTalk, a Network HubManager.andP;  HubTalk lets users remotely manage and control up to 32 hubsconnected on the internetwork with out-of- band diagnostics from a centralconsole.andP;  HubTalk also provides a mapping feature that identifies all activehubs and nodes on the internetwork.andM;PricingandM;The TCNS adapters for both 16-bit ISA and 32-bit EISA computers will bedeliverable in volume by the end of August.andP;  List price of the adapters is$1,495 for the 16-bit ISA adapter (TC3045) and $1,725 for the 32-bit EISAadapter (TC3047).andP;  The Micro Channel adapter will be available later thisyear.andM;The list price for the TCNS Smart Hub is $2,295.andM;TCNS Beta User ProfileandM;At COMDEX Spring '90, when Thomas-Conrad announced TCNS, several beta userannouncements accompanied this news--among them, the network installation atthe University of Texas Health Sciences Center Dental School located in SanAntonio.andM;At the dental school, the capabilities of medial imaging have extended theirway into the dental arena with a project that is the first of its kind.andP;  Dr.andO;S. Brent Dove, affiliated with the University of Texas Dental School, and Dr.andO;W. Doss McDavid, an associate professor on the dental school staff, havedeveloped the Digital Panoramic X-ray (DPX 1000) System for producing directdigital images without the need for expensive radiographic film.andP;  For eachDPX image displayed, approximately 1/2 megabyte of data must traverse thenetwork; a patient record database consisting of both text and image data,which is in development, may take up to 20 Mbytes.andP;  Because these x-rayscause a large amount of data to move across the network each time a dentalradiologist needs to access them, the performance of the network can slow orthe network bandwidth can fill.andP;  As a result, Drs.andP;  Dove and McDavid searchedfor a faster network than their existing system that would let them displaythe images more quickly.andP;  In May, working with Bob Lyons of Multi-NET, aHouston, Texas-based reseller, they installed TCNS.andM;According to Dr. Dove, &quot;The installation of TCNS went remarkably well.andP;  Nowwe have the world's first dental imaging system running the world's fastedlocal-area network.andP;  The results we received surprised us.andP;  The bottleneck isnow the workstation speed rather than the network.andP;  In addition, theimportance of this pairing of digital imaging and an inexpensive network likeTCNS is that dental imaging is now a technology that will be affordable tomost dentists in private practice.&quot;andP;  David Greer, an engineering technicianon Dr. Dove's staff, continues, &quot;On Ethernet, we were seeing aggregateresults of 606-Kbps on two 286-based workstations using Novell's PERFORM2.andO;After installing TCNS, the results we saw were 1,724 Kbps, almost three timesthe throughput of Ethernet.andP;  To gain further performance increases, we mayneed to upgrade our workstations.&quot;andM;ConclusionandM;Making TCNS compatible with ARCNET drivers should make it an instant hitamong ARCNET users desiring high speeds, giving them an advantage over theyet-to-be-delivered 20-Mbps ARCNET.andP;  To be successful in the long run,however, Thomas-Conrad will need to make its design non-proprietary, allowingother vendors to enter the fray, which may help lead to (another) de factoLAN standard.andP;  TCNS certainly beats FDDI on price, but FDDI has its ownmerits, including larger frame sizes,  redundant (dual) ring topology, thebacking of over 50 vendors, and ANSI standard status.andM;For more information, contact Deni Connor at Thomas-Conrad Corporation,1908-R Kramer Lane, Austin, TX 78758; (800) 332- 8683, (512) 836-1935.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
