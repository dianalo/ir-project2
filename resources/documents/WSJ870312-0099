Under the settlement, Automatix is to issue four-year warrants to the class to purchase a total of 250,000 Automatix shares at a price about 50% higher than the current market price. Automatix also will pay the plaintiffs' legal fees, which amount to about $90,000. The settlement won't affect the robotics company's 1987 results, a spokesman said.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Automatix shares closed at $1.25, up 25 cents.    Automatix also said that it reached an agreement with Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. that eliminates a previously disclosed default on certain provisions of industrial revenue bonds that the bank holds.    The agreement reduces the minimum tangible net worth, or assets minus liabilities, that Automatix must maintain to $4 million from $12 million and gives Morgan a security interest in certain Automatix assets. </TEXT></DOC>
