Introduction and Background</ITAG>The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') announcesthe adoption of Rule 19c-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),which adds to the rules of national securities exchanges that make transactionreports available pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act \1\<NOTE/> a prohibition on an exchange listing or continuing to listthe common stock or other equity securities of a domestic issuer if theissuer issues securities, or takes other corporate action, with the effectof nullifying, restricting, or disparately reducing the per share votingrights of any common stock of such issuer registered under Section 12 ofthe Act.\2\<NOTE/> Rule 19c-4 also contains a similar addition to the rulesof a national securities association \3\<NOTE/> to prohibit an association from authorizing, or continuingto authorize, for quotation and/or transaction reporting on an automatedinter-dealer quotation system,\4\<NOTE/> the common stock or other equity securities of a domesticissuer if the issuer issues securities, or takes over corporate action,with the effect of nullifying, restricting, or disparately reducing theper share voting rights of any common stock of such issuer registered underSection 12 of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 17 CFR 240.11Aa3-1 (1988). By limiting the scope of Rule19c-4 to those exchanges that make transaction reports available pursuantto Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act, the Commission excludes the Intermountain(``ISE'') and Spokane (``SSE'') Stock Exchanges from coverage under theRule. The Commission believes this is appropriate because the ISE is dormant,and the securities listed on the SSE do not have a widespread nationalinvestor interest. In addition, the Commission notes that, while Rule 19c-4would not apply to the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'') becauseit currently does not trade stocks, if, and when, the CBOE's proposed rulechange (SR-CBOE-85-50) to trade stocks is approved, Rule 19c-4 would applyto issues traded on the CBOE.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 15 U.S.C. 781.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Currently, the National Association of Securities Dealersis the only national securities association registered under Section 15Aof the Act. 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Currently, NASDAQ is the only such inter-dealer quotationsystem. The so-called ``pink sheets'' and other local inter-dealer quotationsheets do not constitute at present an automated inter-dealer quotationsystem under the Act.On June 22, 1987, the Commission issued a release announcing the commencementof a proceeding pursuant to section 19(c) of the Act to consider whetherto adopt a rule pertaining to the disenfranchisement of shareholder votingrights.\5\<NOTE/> In connection with this proceeding, the Commission solicitedpublic comment on proposed Rule 19c-4 and held public hearings on July22, 1987 (``July hearings'').\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24623 (June 22, 1987),52 FR 23665 (June 24, 1987) (``Proposing Release'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Seventeen commentators testified at this public hearing,and the Commission received over 1100 written comments. <T3>See</T3> text accompanying notes 23 to 68 <T3>infra</T3> (summarizing the significant comments received). The Commissionstaff also has prepared a separate document, summarizing all comments inmore detail, which is available in the Commission's Public Reference Section,450 Fifth St. NW., Washington, DC. 20549, under File No. S7-22-87.The decision by the Commission to propose Rule 19c-4 followed attemptsby the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), American Stock Exchange (``Amex''),and the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') to resolvethe issue of voting rights listing standards. In September 1986, the NYSEfiled with the Commission a proposed rule change \7\<NOTE/> pursuant to section 19(b) of the Act \8\<NOTE/> and Rule 19b-4 thereunder \9\<NOTE/> to modify its long-standing rule mandating a one share, onevote standard for all common stocks listed on the NYSE.\1\\0\<NOTE/> The NYSE filing represented the culmination of a two yeardeliberative process, begun in 1984 when General Motors Corporation (``GM'')announced its intention to issue a second class of stock with one-halfvote per share to finance its acquisition of Electronic Data Systems. Asa result of the GM issuance and the subsequent proposal by a number ofother NYSE companies to issue disparate voting rights stock, the NYSE declareda moratorium on compliance with its one share, one vote rule, and appointeda Subcommittee on Shareholder Participation and Qualitative Listing Standards(``Subcommittee'').\1\\1\<NOTE/> As of June 1, 1988, the NYSE had 55 listed companies thathad either issued disparate voting rights stock or amended their chartersto limit the voting power of large shareholders (capped voting rights plans)or holders of recently purchased shares (tenured or time phased votingplans). These various departures from the one share, one vote rule arecollectively called ``disparate voting rights plans.''\1\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ SR-NYSE-86-17. The filing was published for comment inSecurities Exchange Act Release No. 23724 (October 17, 1986), 51 FR 37529.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ 17 CFR 240. 19b-4.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ <T3>See</T3> NYSE <T3>Listed Company Manual,</T3> Section 313.00. Generally, the Listed CompanyManual provides standards that an issuer must meet to be listed on theNYSE. Currently, the NYSE standards prohibit the listing of an issuer thathas a class of stock having unusual voting provisions that tend to nullifyor restrict the voting rights of the class, or that has voting rights notin proportion to the equity interests of the class.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ Shortly after the NYSE initiated its study of its oneshare, one vote rule, the Pacific Stock Exchange (``PSE'') filed a proposedrule change to permit its listed companies to issue dual classes of stock.<T3>See</T3> File No. SR-PSE-84-23. The proposal was published for commentin Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23970 (January 6, 1987), 52 FR 1686.With the consent of the PSE, action on its proposal was deferred so thatit could be considered in conjunction with any NYSE action.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ An additional 5 NYSE listed companies have adopted,but not yet implemented, disparate voting rights plans. As of June 1, 1988the Amex had 117 and NASDAQ had 182 companies with disparate voting rightsplans. In December 1986, the Amex filed a proposed rule change, subsequentlywithdrawn, to eliminate its restrictions on the issuance of disparate votingrights stock. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23951 (January 2, 1987),52 FR 1574.Following the recommendation of the Subcommittee that the NYSE should permitthe listing of classes of stock having disparate voting rights, subjectto certain conditions, the NYSE proposed an amendment to Section 313 ofits Listed Company Manual.\1\\3\<NOTE/> The NYSE cited a number of factors that it believed necessitatedmodification of its rule, including the growing competition for listingswith the Amex and NASD, the desire of NYSE-listed companies to adopt disparatevoting rights plans as takeover defenses, the belief that corporate issuersshould have flexibility in raising capital and adopting corporate structures,and the belief that regulatory changes, such as improvements in corporatedisclosure, had made the shareholder protection provided by the one share,one vote rule less important.\1\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ <T3>See</T3> Proposing Release, <T3>supra</T3> note 5, at 23665-66. As discussed in the Proposing Release,the NYSE proposal submitted to the Commission differed significantly fromthe original Subcommittee recommendations. <T3>Id.</T3> at n. 16. The NYSE proposal has not been withdrawn.<T3> See</T3> note 82 <T3>infra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ <T3>See</T3> SR-NYSE-86-17.The proposed amendment to section 313 would permit the listing of a classor classes of common stock with disparate voting rights if a majority ofthe issuer's independent directors and ``public'' shareholders approvedthe creation of the class or classes of stock.\1\\5\<NOTE/> Under the proposal, listed companies that created disparatevoting rights stock during the NYSE moratorium would have two years fromapproval of the NYSE proposal to comply with the rule. Companies with disparatevoting classes applying for NYSE listing would have to comply with therule prior to listing. Finally, no approval would be necessary if the disparatevoting class was outstanding when the company first went public, or wasdistributed pro rata among the distributor's common shareholders in a spin-offtransaction in which the distributor was not the issuer.\1\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ In addition to the NYSE actions, there have been anumber of legislative proposals concerning shareholder voting rights. In1985, H.R. 2783, the Shareholder Democracy Protection Act, was introducedby Representative Dingell. H.R. 2783 would have established a uniform oneshare, one vote rule. Identical legislation, S. 1314, was introduced bySenators Cranston, Metzenbaum, and D'Amato. Neither proposal was reportedout of committee. In 1987, two bills were introduced that would have establisheda uniform one share, one vote rule. <T3>See</T3> H.R. 2172, the Tender Offer Reform Act of 1987, introducedby Representative Dingell, and H.R. 2668, the Securities Trading ReformAct, introduced by Representatives Lent and Rinaldo. Both bills have beenreferred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, but have not beenreported out of Committee. Finally, the Tender Offer Disclosure and FairnessAct of 1987, S. 1323, would direct the Commission to review rules of theSROs concerning shareholder voting rights and report the results of thisreview to Congress by October 1, 1988. S. 1323 was reported out of theSenate Banking Committee on December 17, 1987. On June 17, 20, and 21,1988 the Senate debated S. 1323, but no action has been taken on the bill.In recognition of the significant concerns raised by the NYSE proposal,the Commission issued a release soliciting comment,\17\<NOTE/> and held hearings on the issue on December 16 and 17, 1986(``December hearings''). Over 40 commentators testified at the Decemberhearings and 185 written comments were submitted to the Commission.\18\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23803 (November 13,1986), 51 FR 41715. The release solicited comment on the potential effectof the NYSE proposal, and whether a minimum policy concerning voting rightslisting standards should be developed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ The Commission staff prepared a separate document containinga detailed summary of all written comments and testimony. This document,along with the comment letters and transcripts of the December hearings,is available in File Nos. SR-NYSE-86-17 and 4-308 in the Commission's PublicReference Section. Many of these comments focused generally on the votingrights issue and the development of a minimum standard. The Commissionhas incorporated the comments in response to the NYSE proposal in its recordon Rule 19c-4. <T3>See </T3>Proposing Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, at 52 FR 23667.In December 1986, following the public hearings, the Amex filed a ruleproposal to eliminate entirely its partial restrictions on the issuanceof disparate voting rights stock.\19\<NOTE/> On March 13, 1987, the NASD submitted a letter to the Commission,supporting the concept of a minimum voting rights rule with certain exceptions.\20\<NOTE/> A series of meetings were held between the NASD, Amex, andNYSE, attended by Commission staff, to explore the possibility of a minimumrule. Despite these efforts, the three self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'')were unable to reach a consensus on a minimum rule.\21\<NOTE/> As a result of the failure of the SROs to reach an accord,the Commission proposed Rule 19c-4, the Shareholder DisenfranchisementRule, pursuant to its section 19(c) authority.\22\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23951, <T3>supra </T3>note 12. The Amex withdrew the filing in April 1987. Currently,Section 122 of the Amex Listed Company Guide prohibits the listing of non-votingcommon stock, but permits the listing of limited voting common stock undercertain conditions. <T3>See </T3>Proposing Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, at note 21.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ <T3>See </T3>letter from Gordon S.

The NASD submitted toits members for comment a shareholder voting rights proposal for NASDAQcompanies containing this standard. <T3>See </T3>NASD Notice to Members 87-32, dated May 28, 1987. Further,the NYSE Board of Directors endorsed, in principal, a similar approachat its June 4, 1987 Board meeting. <T3>See </T3>Proposing Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, at note 24 and accompanying text.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ <T3>See </T3>15 U.S.C. 78s(c).

Summary of Comments</ITAG>As noted, the Commission received over 1,100 comment letters and heardtestimony from 17 people in response to its request for comments on proposedRule 19c-4.A. Comments in Support of Rule 19c-4Approximately 1,000 commentators indicated support for adoption of theRule.\23\<NOTE/> The primary reasons cited in support of the Rule are that:(1) The adoption of a minimum voting rights standard is necessary to ensuremanagement accountability; \24\<NOTE/> (2) the Rule will protect shareholder interests in connectionwith contests for corporate control; \25\<NOTE/> (3) the Rule will protect shareholders from being disenfranchised,while permitting companies to utilize disparate voting rights plans forcapital raising purposes; \26\<NOTE/> and (4) the Rule would prevent a ``race to the bottom'' forlisting standards among SROs.\27\<NOTE/> Many of the comments in support of the rule mirrored argumentsraised by commentators against adoption of the original NYSE proposal.\28\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ Approximately 800 of the comments in support of the Rulewere submitted by individual members of the United Shareholders Association,who advocated a one share, one vote standard with no exceptions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>letter from Donald K.

They testified that such insulation leads to entrenched,inefficient corporate managements acting in their own best interest insteadof the best interest of the company and its shareholders.\29\<NOTE/> Some commentators noted that such management behavior seriouslywould undermine investor confidence in the nation's equity markets, whichwould lead eventually to investors removing their capital from those markets.\30\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> letter from James S. Martin, Executive Vice President,College Retirement Equities Fund, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC,dated August 3, 1987 (``CREF comment''); Valhi comment,<T3> supra</T3> note 24, at 1. CREF argued that equal voting rights areessential to help ensure that management is responsive to shareholder concerns,because the vote allows shareholders not only to elect a board of directors,but also to protect their investment by influencing corporate policy. Whenshareholders' ability to influence corporate policy is reduced, managementis more free to act in its own best interests at the expense of the efficientoperation of the company.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ <T3>See</T3> CREF comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 29, at 2-3; Valhi comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 24, at 1.Other commentators stated that Rule 19c-4 would protect the interests ofshareholders in connection with contests for corporate control.\31\<NOTE/> They indicated that the Rule would prevent the disenfranchisementof common stockholders, thereby preserving their opportunity to share inany control premium.\32\<NOTE/> In this connection, Professor Gilson stated that empiricalevidence indicates there are significant differences in the wealth effectsfor public shareholders in a leveraged buyout versus an adoption of a disparatevoting rights plan, with shareholders benefiting substantially from buyoutsbut not from a shift in voting rights through the implementation of disparatevoting rights plans. Gilson further noted that the Rule is appropriatebecause it does not prevent management or an existing large shareholderfrom acquiring control of a company, but instead simply requires that shareholdersbe paid adequately for transfer of control.\33\<NOTE/> Other commentators argued that the Rule would prevent managementfrom using its proxy agenda-setting power to disenfranchise shareholders.\34\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ <T3> See, e.g.,</T3> Gilson comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 25, at 1-2; letter from Jeffrey N.

Ruback, Professor,Massachusetts Institute of Technology, July hearings (``Ruback comment'').A number of commentators supporting the Rule testified that a shareholderapproval standard for adoption of disparate voting rights plans would beinsufficient to prevent abusive disparate voting rights plans.\35\<NOTE/> These commentators cited the coercive influence managementcan exert on shareholder voting by setting the proxy agenda and placingcorporate pension plan managers under substantial pressure to vote in favorof the recapitalization.\36\<NOTE/> Further, one commentator noted that in an exchange offerof super voting stock with low dividends for lower voting stock with highdividends, shareholders feel compelled to exchange their shares for lowervoting stock to avoid holding higher voting stock that has become ineffective.\37\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ <T3> See e.g.,</T3> Ruback comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 34, at 1-2; written testimony of Elliot J.

Some expressed the opinion that disparatevoting rights plans lead to entrenched, inefficient corporate managements,which result in a loss of investor confidence in the marketplace and adecrease in equity values.\4\\2\<NOTE/> CREF suggested that corporate management becomes less efficientand less responsive to competitive pressure without the discipline of meaningfulshareholder control. The FAF testified that the shareholders' right tovote is necessary to ensure that corporate management focuses its resourceson the corporation's development for the benefit of the shareholders ratherthan for its own particular interests. Several institutional investor commentatorsstressed that the right to vote is one of the primary means by which shareholdersprotect their interests.\4\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\1\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>letter from Peter M.

Asnoted, many commentators objected to any rule other than a one share, onevote standard that would apply to all markets without exception. Most ofthese commentators argued that the exceptions to the Rule eventually wouldundermine its intent and effectivenss.\4\\4\<NOTE/> Some commentators urged elimination or restriction of thegrandfathering provision \4\\5\<NOTE/> or the adoption of a requirement mandating minority shareholderapproval of existing disparate voting rights plans.\4\\6\<NOTE/> Some commentators suggested that NYSE-listed companies thatinstituted disparate voting rights plans during the NYSE moratorium shouldnot be grandfathered under the Rule because these companies took such actionin clear violation of existing NYSE rules.\4\\7\<NOTE/> Specifically, ISS argued that the grandfather provision shouldapply only to those companies whose disparate voting rights plans werepermissible under the listing standards of their SRO. Other commentatorsopined that the exceptions for initial public offerings and bona fide businesspurposes were vague, and would allow for capitalizations that should beprohibited by the Rule.\4\\8\<NOTE/> Finally, a number of commentators objected to the limitationof the scope of the Rule to domestic issuers.\4\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\4\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>CREF comment, <T3>supra </T3>note 29, at 3; Keystone comment, <T3>supra </T3>note 24 at 2; Valhi comment, <T3>supra </T3>note 24, at 2.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\5\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Fidelity comment, <T3>supra </T3>note 26, at 2; letter from Ronald Langley, President, IndustrialEquity (Pacific) Ltd., to Jonathan G.

Comments Opposed to Rule 19c-4Ninety-one commentators either expressed opposition to the adoption ofRule 19c-4, or concern about the scope of the Rule's grandfather clause.An overwhelming majority of the 91 commentators in this group were publiccompanies, associations or groups of public companies, or law firms representingpublic companies. Five major themes were represented in the negative comments:(1) Lack of Commission authority to promulgate Rule 19c-4; (2) potentialconflict between the Rule and state laws concerning corporate governance;(3) inadequacy of the grandfathering provision, either generally or relatingto the commentator's specific factual situation; (4) concerns regardingthe breadth and workability of the Rule; and (5) assertions that disparatevoting rights plans approved by shareholders should be permitted.Thirty-two commentators questioned the Commission's authority to adopta rule in the area of qualitative listing or authorization standards.\5\\0\<NOTE/> The ABA, reiterating an argument made during the initialNYSE proceeding, testified that ``the language and legislative historyof the Act, especially that of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975,clearly establish that the Commission does not have authority to imposesubstantive corporate law standards on listed companies through its oversightauthority over the rules of the exchanges and the NASD under sections 19(b), (c) and (h) of the Act.'' \5\\1\<NOTE/> The Business Roundtable agreed with the ABA, noting thatCommission authority to promulgate Rule 19c-4 ``cannot be found eitherin the language of Section 19(c) or in the legislative history of thatprovision.'' \5\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\0\ <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, letter from Robert Todd Lang, Chairman, Task Forceon Disparate Voting Rights, Section of Corporation, Banking and BusinessLaw, American Bar Association, to Jonathan G.

Approximately forty commentators were concerned only about the effect ofthe Rule's grandfathering provision. A majority of these commentators werepublic companies with existing or anticipated disparate voting rights plans.Generally, companies that had such plans in place prior to May 15, 1987,the announced grandfather date, sought assurance that their plan wouldbe unaffected by the Rule.\6\\3\<NOTE/> Other commentators were more specific, requesting clarificationof the scope of the grandfather clause. The inclusion of a grandfatherclause in the Rule raised a number of specific interpretative questions,generally concerning subsequent activities by grandfathered companies.Specifically, commentators addressed the legitimacy of continued issuancesof disparate voting rights stock, issuances of authorized but previouslyunissued disparate voting rights stock, and the effect of the Rule on optionsfor or securities convertible to super voting stock.\6\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\3\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>written testimony of Henry Lowenthal, Senior Vice President,American Greetings Corp., July hearings; letter from James A.

Times Mirror argued that the grandfather clausemade the application of Rule 19c-4 retroactive, that retroactive rulesmust meet a separate, more stringent standard, and that the Commissionhad failed to meet this standard.

Discussion</ITAG>After a careful review of the record, including all comment letters receivedand testimony of witnesses, the Commission believes a minimum standardconcerning voting rights listing standards is necessary, and has decidedto adopt Rule 19c-4. In addition to providing the rationale, justification,and authority for the Commission's decision to adopt Rule 19c-4, the discussionbelow clarifies certain interpretations of the Rule as adopted and modificationsmade to the Rule as initially proposed.A. Need for Rule 19c-4In proposing Rule 19c-4, the Commission recognized that regulation of shareholdervoting rights under the Federal securities laws raises difficult and complexissues. The Commission noted that the initial NYSE proposal to abandonits one share, one vote standard had important ramifications for managementaccountability, tender offers and changes in corporate control, the rightsof majority and minority shareholders, competition among SROs, and theintegrity of the nation's securities markets. The Commission continuesto believe that the issue of shareholder voting rights has far-reachingimplications, and that a rule ensuring a minimum level of shareholder protectionfrom disenfranchising actions is appropriate and consistent with the purposesof the Act. Further, the Rule, which will operate through the listing standardsof SROs, has been crafted to be consistent with federalism objectives byseeking to minimize intrusion into traditional state regulation.\6\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\9\ <T3>See </T3>note 84 <T3>infra</T3>.Until relatively recently, disparate voting rights plans were used primarilyby smaller companies with significant insider ownership. Traditionally,these companies had gone public with a weighted voting scheme designedto allow the founders to maintain control as the company grew. In the 1980s,however, corporate bidders began targeting increasingly large companies,and disparate voting rights plans became an important defensive tacticin response to the possibility of a hostile tender offer. As the use ofthese plans evolved, the Commission became concerned that, in many instances,the methods of issuing disparate voting rights stock were structured todisenfranchise existing shareholders and had consequences far beyond managementdesires to deter hostile takeover bids.While certain disparate voting rights plans serve to disenfranchise existingshareholders, the Commission does not believe that the issuance of lessthan full voting rights stock is <T3>per se </T3>inappropriate. The Commission agrees that there may bevalid business or economic reasons for issuing disparate voting rightsstock, the effect of which is not disenfranchising to existing shareholders.\7\\0\<NOTE/> The Commission believes, however, that disparate voting rightsplans that disenfranchise existing shareholders are inconsistent with therequirements of the Act. Shareholders who purchase voting shares in a companydo so with the understanding that the shares will be accompanied by thevoting rights attendant to the stock at the time of purchase. The diminutionor limitation of these rights is inconsistent with the investor protectionand fair corporate suffrage policies embodied in sections 6(b)(5), 15A(b)(6),and 14 of the Act.\7\\1\<NOTE/> In addition, in the year prior to the Proposing Release anincreasing number of companies recapitalized in a manner that disenfranchisedshareholders of their voting rights. Many of these issuers were more establishedcompanies with extensive public ownership. A continuation of these disenfranchisementswould reduce investor confidence in the securities markets in the UnitedStates. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\0\ <T3>See </T3>text accompanying notes 88 to 97 <T3>infra </T3>(discussing permitted actions under the Rule).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5), 78<T3>o</T3>-3(b)(6), 78n. The Commission recognizes that under state law, disparate voting rightsplans generally are permitted subject to shareholder approval.\7\\2\<NOTE/> The Commission also recognizes, however, that collectiveaction problems may make defeating an issuer recapitalization proposalextremely difficult.\7\\3\<NOTE/> Many commentators in both the December and July hearings,including institutional investors, individual investors, and law professors,testified extensively about the difficulties involved in shareholders actingtogether in their collective best interest.\7\\4\<NOTE/> Frequently, a disparate voting rights plan is presented toshareholders in a form, such as an offer to exchange higher vote stockfor lower vote stock with a dividend sweetener, that provides shareholderswith an incentive to accept less than full voting rights stock rather thanoppose the recapitalization, although, acting collectively, shareholdersas a group might prefer to retain their voting rights and reject the sweeteneroffered by management. The coercive nature of some disparate voting rightsplans may also be exacerbated by management's ability to set the proxyagenda and use corporate funds to lobby shareholders in favor of its proposal.The Commission also has heard testimony from institutional investors describingthe pressure placed on managers of corporate pension plans during the shareholdervoting process.\7\\5\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\2\<T3>See, e.g., </T3>8 Del. Code Ann. section 151(a).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\3\<T3>See, e.g., </T3>Weiss comment, <T3>supra </T3>note 35, at 3-5; Ruback comment, <T3>supra </T3>note 34, at 1-3; oral testimony of James Heard, InvestorResponsibility Research Center, December hearings. Professor Weiss referredto the ``substantial body of literature'' explaining why the shareholdervote is not always an accurate representation of shareholder preference.For example, Professor Weiss cited the ``rational apathy'' problem, whichleads shareholders to suppport management proposals because the expectedcost to any one shareholder of carefully evaluating these proposals willgreatly exceed any potential benefit to the shareholder. Second, ProfessorWeiss outlined the ``free rider'' problem, which acknowledged that thetypical shareholder will not make the effort to evaluate a management-sponsoredproposal, but will rely on other shareholders to do that and ``free ride''on their efforts.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\4\<T3>See </T3>Proposing Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, at 23669.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\5\<T3>See </T3>oral testimony of James E. Heard, Deputy Director, InvestorResponsibility Research Center, December hearings; and oral testimony ofNell Minow, General Counsel, Institutional Shareholders Services, Inc.,July hearings. <T3>See also, </T3>Weiss comment, <T3>supra </T3>note 35, at 106 (stating that institutional shareholdersalso may be susceptible to collective action problems). The Commissionagain notes that the comments by pension fund favored adoption of a minimumvoting rights rule. These comments lead the Commission to believe thatthe collective action limitations noted above can result in the disenfranchisementof institutional shareholders, and also dispute claims that increased institutionalholdings in the markets makes defeating a recapitalization more likely.<T3>See, also, </T3>the Labor Department Letter on Proxy Voting by PlanFiduciaries, BNA Pension Reporter, February 29, 1988, Vol. 15 p. 391. Although the Commission does not believe that shareholders invariably arepowerless to defeat an issuer-sponsored proposal to recapitalize, the Commissiondoes believe that, because of the forces cited above, the shareholder votingprocess is not fully effective in preventing the adoption of disparatevoting rights plans that disenfranchise shareholders. The Commission believesthat it is preferable for a company's insiders wishing to gain voting controlto do so through a repurchase of shares in which such repurchase is subjectto market discipline and judicial review regarding state corporate fiduciaryrequirements.  Moreover, the Commission is concerned about the rights of minority shareholders,who are permanently disenfranchised by a proposal against which they voted.While the shareholder voting mechanism may be of limited effectivenessin protecting against disenfranchisement by management, it nonethelesshas value in ensuring management accountability. For example, shareholdershave occasionally elected dissidents in proxy contests for control of acompany's Board of Directors. Moreover, the potential that shareholderswill vote against management or at least amass a sufficient oppositionvote to embarrass the company contributes to ongoing accountability.  The Commission has reviewed the empirical evidence regarding the wealthimpact of disparate voting rights plans on common stock price. In the ProposingRelease, the Commission stated its belief that the empirical evidence regardingthe price effect of disparate voting rights plans required further considerationand investigation.\7\\6\<NOTE/> The Commission noted that although existing economic studiesgenerally had not demonstrated statistically significant wealth reductionsas a result of disparate voting rights plans, further empirical study wouldbe useful to examine the extent to which such voting structures are beneficial,or at least not harmful, to shareholders.\7\\7\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\6\Proposing Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, at 23672.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\7\<T3>Id. </T3>at nn. 34-35, 84 (citing studies evaluating wealth effectsof disparate voting rights recapitalizations).  The Commission's Office of Chief Economist (``OCE''), now the Office ofEconomic Analysis, in a update to its initial study of the wealth effectsof disparate voting rights plans,\7\\8\<NOTE/> did find significant negative wealth effect in connectionwith such recapitalizations. In particular, the OCE update found that negativeprice effects were concentrated in companies that had recapitalized afterthe NYSE announced its moratorium on enforcing its one share, one voterule. Importantly, the OCE Update also noted that the post-moratorium firmswere characterized by substantially lower insider holdings and substantiallyhigher institutional holdings, as compared to companies that had recapitalizedprior to the NYSE moratorium.\7\\9\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\8\<T3>See </T3>OCE, Update_``The Effects of Dual Class Recapitalization onthe Wealth of Shareholders: Including Evidence from 1986 and 1987,'' July16, 1987 (``OCE Update'').  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\9\The OCE also noted the increased use of the exchangeoffer method of creating disparate voting rights stock since 1984.    Although the OCE Update is useful evidence of the negative effects of disenfranchisement,the measurement of immediate change in securities price is not a completeindicator of the negative effects of disenfranchising actions. As severalcommentators have suggested, the negative effects of a permanent deprivationof shareholder voting rights may not appear until some time after the disenfranchisingaction is announced or occurs, and may be impossible to measure preciselyat the time of enactment.\8\\0\<NOTE/> For example, loss of independent shareholder control in acompany may not manifest itself until sometime in the future through alower takeover permium offered for the company's shares, or through managementactions undertaken without the discipline of accountability to shareholders.\8\\1\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the Commission does not consider evidence onshareholder wealth effects to be critical to its conclusions. The Commissionhas relied in its analysis and decision on the coercive (and for minorityshareholders involuntary) disenfranchisement resulting from issuer impositionof disparate voting rights structures, which can have long term negativeeffects on shareholders.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\0\ <T3>See</T3> Proposing Release, <T3>supra</T3> note 5, at nn. 83-85.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\1\ Recent transactions involving Resorts Internationalillustrate this point. In 1986, there were 5.7 million shares of ClassA stock outstanding, having one vote each, and 750,000 shares of ClassB stock outstanding with 100 votes each. The Class B stock representedless than 12% of the outstanding shares but had 93% of the voting power.In early 1986, the Class B stock generally traded at a 2-3 point permium(5-7.5%) above the Class A stock, within the 50 dollar range. After thedeath of Resorts' Chairman in April 1986, negotiations for the Class Bholdings of the estate, which constituted approximately 72% of the outstandingshares of the class, culminated with the sale of the Class B stock to DonaldTrump at $135 per share in July 1987. Although the price of the Class Arose to the $60 range during July and August 1987, following the purchaseof the Class B block it declined steadily to the point where it was tradingat the $20 level during February 1988 and currently trades in the $30 range.<T3>See also</T3> letter from the Toronto Society of Financial Analysts,to John S.R. Shad, Chairman, SEC, dated November 14, 1986 (discussing tradingin Class Aandamp;B stock of Canadian Tire Corporation). In that case, holdersof voting stock sought to obtain control by purchasing blocks of votingstock that had been put up for sale. This attempt to change control avoidedtriggering a protective provision that would have required non-voting stockto be converted to voting stock if an offer was made to substantially allholders of common stock. As a result of this situation, in October 1986,the Class B voting stock was trading at over double the price of the ClassA non-voting stock, despite the non-voting to voting conversion provisionand that there were only 3.45 million voting shares as opposed to 81.8million non-voting shares outstanding.Moreover, the Commission believes that the investor protection and shareholdersuffrage policies of the Act compel action in this area, rather than simpledisapproval of the original NYSE proposal. The Commission recognizes thecompetitive pressures that initially led the NYSE to propose to abandonits one share, one vote standard. By facilitating the development of anational market system, the Commission has been a strong supporter of competitionamong the markets. Without suggesting that competition necessarily wouldresult in the markets removing all voting rights standards, the Commissioncontinues to note that many major corporations expressed concern in theinitial proceeding about the potential of a hostile takeover bid and thatsuch concern might lead corporations to adopt disparate voting rights plansas takeover defenses. It is therefore likely that companies may chooseto move to a particular SRO primarily to implement disparate voting rightsplans for defensive purposes.The Commission finds significant that in both the December and July hearings,and in the written comments, almost all shareholders and shareholder groupstestified that the Commission should protect voting rights by adoptingthe Rule or a more stringent version of the Rule, such as a one share,one vote standard. Both individual and institutional shareholders arguedthat unless the Commission acted in this area, more issuers eventuallywould institute disenfranchising voting rights plans. Moreover, the largemajority of academics commenting or testifying argued that the Commissionhas both the authority and the responsibility to stop voting rights disenfranchisement.Further, the major securities marketplaces, as well as the representativeorganization for state securities administrators, testified that they lookto the Commission for leadership in establishing a minimum marketplacestandard to protect shareholder voting rights.Finally, in adopting Rule 19c-4, the Commission intends to prohibit disparatevoting rights plans that disenfranchise existing shareholders, while continuingto allow corporations flexibility in devising their capital structures.\82\<NOTE/> In addition, the Commission does not seek to prohibit issuersfrom issuing stock with restricted or no voting rights, as those restrictionsare a consideration the investor will take into account when deciding topurchase a security. Rather, the Commission seeks to prevent the deprivationof voting rights that occurs after a security has been purchased. Accordingly,as discussed in more detail below, the Commission's Rule 19c-4 focuseson the process by which certain disparate voting rights structures arecreated, not the issuer's capital structure <T3>per se.</T3> We believe this approach is consistent with the role ofthe Commission in regulating the public securities markets for the protectionof investors.\83\<NOTE/> Rule 19c-4 identifies those situations in which shareholdersare disenfranchised and prohibit companies from continued access to thenational securities marketplace if they take such action. In doing so,Rule 19c-4 is consistent with the federalism objective of minimal intrusioninto areas of traditional state regulation.\84\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\82\The Commission, in adopting Rule 19c-4, is not commencingdisapproval proceedings for the NYSE and PSE proposed rule changes to eliminatetheir one share, one vote listing standards (SR-NYSE-86-17 and SR-PSE-84-23).The NYSE proposed rule change may act as an appropriate supplement to theminimum protections accorded by Rule 19c-4. For example, even though Rule19c-4 presumes to permit issuances of lower voting stock under certaincircumstances, the SRO could still require a majority of independent shareholdersto vote to approve such an issuance. The NYSE and PSE should consider howthey want to treat their proposed rule changes in light of the adoptionof Rule 19c-4. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\83\<T3>See</T3> text accompanying notes 160 to 180 <T3>infra</T3> (discussing Commission authority to promulgate Rule 19c-4to further investor protection). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\84\The Commission has received a written request by the BusinessRoundtable to comply voluntarily with Executive Orders 12612 (``Federalism'')and 12291 (``Federal Regulation'') in its rulemaking. Executive Order 12612,52 FR 41685 (1987); E.O. 12290, 3 CFR 127 (1982). <T3>See</T3> letter from Jim J. Tozzi, Director, Multinational BusinessServices, Inc., to David S. Ruder, Chairman, SEC, dated January 15, 1988.The Commission notes that it is expressly excluded from the coverage ofthe executive orders. Executive Order 12612 is directed to ``executivedepartments and agencies,'' not independent agencies. Executive Order 12291excludes the Commission by defining ``agency'' as ``any authority of theUnited States that is an agency under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1).'' The Commissionis an independent agency specified in 44 U.S.C. 3502(10). Although theCommission is excluded from Executive Order 12291, and is not requiredto comply with Executive Order 12612, the Commission has been sensitiveto the underlying objectives of the two orders. In drafting Rule 19c-4,the Commission has approached the issue of shareholder voting rights ina manner consistent with the doctrine of federalism. The Commission hasattempted to limit its impact on state regulation of corporate structuresby targeting only those corporate transactions that disenfranchise existingshareholders. B. Description of Rule 19c-4 Rule 19c-4, as adopted, adds to the rules of national securities exchangesthat make transaction reports available pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-1 underthe Act a prohibition on an exchange listing or continuing to list thecommon stock or other equity security of a domestic issuer\85\<NOTE/> registered under section 12 of the Act, if the issuer issuesany class of securities, or takes other corporate action, with the effectof nullifying, restricting, or disparately reducing the per share votingrights of holders of any outstanding common stock of such issuer. Rule19c-4 also adds to the rules of national securities associations a prohibitionon an association from authorizing, or continuing to authorize, for quotationand/or transaction reporting on an automated inter-dealer quotation system\86\<NOTE/> the common stock or other equity security of a domestic issuerregistered under section 12 of the Act, if the issuer issues any classof securities, or takes other corporate action, with the effect of nullifying,restricting, or disparately reducing the per share voting rights of holdersof any outstanding common stock of such issuer. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\85\A definition of ``domestic issuer'' has been added tothe Rule. Paragraph (e)(4) of the Rule defines ``domestic issuer'' as anyissuer that is not a ``foreign private issuer'' as defined in Rule 3b-4under the Act. This definition is identical to the definition of ``domesticissuer'' discussed in the Proposing Release. <T3>See</T3> Proposing Release, <T3>supra</T3> note 5, at n.98. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\86\As noted above, NASDAQ is currently the only such inter-dealerquotation system. The rule would apply, of course to any other inter-dealerquotation systems that are formed in the future. Rule 19c-4 also provides a certain degree of flexibility by permittingan exchange or association to issue rules, policies, practices, or interpretations,subject to Commission review pursuant to section 19(b) of the Act, thatwould specify the types of securities issuances or corporate actions coveredby, or excluded from, the prohibitions contained in Rule 19c-4.\87\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\87\Under section 19(b), if an exchange or association submitssuch a rule, policy, practice or interpretation to the Commission for review,in order to approve it the Commission must find that such rule, policy,practice or interpretation is consistent with the protection of investorsand the public interest, and, generally, in furtherance of the purposesof the Act. <T3>See</T3> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b). As discussed in more detail below, commentators suggested that the Ruleinclude in its text those items previously described in detail in the ProposingRelease regarding issuances of stock and other corporate action that wouldbe either permitted or prohibited under the Rule. Accordingly, in responseto commentators' suggestions and in order to clarify the operation andeffect of the Rule, the Rule contains a non-exclusive list of issuancesof stock and other corporate actions presumed to be permitted or prohibitedunder the Rule. In addition, the grandfather date has been changed fromthe proposed date of May 15, 1987, to the effective date of the Rule. Finally,the discussion below clarifies the interaction between the Rule and statecontrol share acquisition statutes and corporate defensive takeover tactics,such as poison pills and lock-up options, and other interpretive issuesthat have been raised by commentators. Although modified slightly in form,the Rule as adopted is identical substantively to the Rule as proposed.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Permitted Actions Under Rule 19c-4</ITAG>As adopted, the Rule contains a non-exclusive list of actions presumedto be permitted under the Rule.\8\\8\<NOTE/> The list of permitted actions reflects the belief by theCommission that there are valid business and economic purposes for theissuance or purchase of common stock with limited voting rights in certainsituation.\8\\9\<NOTE/> The listing of certain actions that, standing alone, arepresumed to be permitted is not intended to provide an exemption for aplan or scheme, involving such an action in conjunction with others, thatdisenfranchise existing shareholders.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\8\ <T3>See </T3>Rule 19c-4(d). The SROs may choose, subject to Commissionreview, to identify, by rule, other transactions involving disparate votingstock which do not raise disenfranchisement concerns.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\\9\ The Commission always has recognized that there existlegitimate uses for disparate voting rights stock for bona fide businesspurposes. <T3>See </T3>Proposing Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, at 23671. For example, Paragraph (c)(4) of the originalRule [now paragraph (e)(5)] exempted from the scope of the Rule ordinarypreferred stock or nonconvertible debt, <T3>i.e., </T3>securities that had preference over the issuer's commonstock as a dividends, interest payments, redemption, or payment in liquidationwhose voting rights only became effective as the result of specific events,not related to an acquisition, which reasonably could be expected to relateto the issuer's financial ability to meet its obligations to that seniorclass of securities.a. <T3>Initial Public Offerings</T3>. First, the Commission presumes thatthe issuance of disparate voting rights stock pursuant to an initial registeredpublic offering (``IPO'') is not a disenfranchising action.\9\\0\<NOTE/> The purchase of limited voting rights stock in an IPO doesnot disenfranchise shareholders who purchase shares with the full knowledge,through adequate disclosure, of the limits on their individual and collectivevoting power. In such a situation, there is no existing class of publicshareholders that is deprived of actual or potential voting control bythe issuance of a class of disparate voting rights stock.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\0\ <T3>See </T3>Proposing Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, at 23671, 23673. The term ``initial public offering''is intended to mean the offering of securities by a company by which itgoes public. For example, if a company offers Class A stock to the publicand a year later offers Class B super voting stock, only the Class A stockoffering is an ``initial public offering.''b. <T3>Subsequent Issuances of Lower Voting Stock. </T3>Second, a public corporationthat wishes to raise capital and desires neither to burden the companywith additional debt nor dilute present ownership may choose to raise thatcapital through the issuance of lower voting rights stock.\9\\1\<NOTE/> As with the IPO example, shareholders purchasing a new issueof lower voting stock are fully aware of the limits on their voting power,both individually and collectively, at the time of purchase. By restrictingsubsequent offerings to equal or lesser voting stock, no existing individualor class of shareholder is disenfranchised by this form of capitalization.\9\\2\<NOTE/> Although the Rule speaks in terms of public offerings, aprivate offering of lower voting stock would be subject to the same analysis,inasmuch as such issuance does not disenfranshise existing shareholders.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\1\ <T3>Id. </T3>If the lower voting stock has features, such as convertibilityfrom the full voting stock, that would in effect constitute an exchangeoffer or otherwise potentially affect or diminish the voting rights ofexisting shareholders, the presumption would be rebutted and the SRO wouldhave to apply the Rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\2\ Professor Gordon, in his comment letter, suggestedthat a subsequent offering of lower voting stock also could dilute theeconomic value of existing shareholders' stock. Gordon argues that a companywill have to sell a larger number of limited voting shares than ordinarycommon or provide limited voting shares with greater than pro rata dividendsin order to raise a given amount of capital. <T3>See, </T3>Gordon comment, <T3>supra </T3>note 31. While such issuances may affect the economic valueof existing shares as compared to an issuance of fully voting shares, theymay be preferable to other methods of raising capital without dilutingthe voting power of existing shareholders. In any event, these occurrencesby themselves would not nullify, restrict, or disparately reduce the votingrights of the ordinary common shares.The simplest case under this section of the Rule involves a company thathas one class of stock with one vote per share. The company could makea public offering of additional shares of this class or offer a new classwith less than one vote per share. Once the company issues lower votingstock, a question arises as to whether it can issue subsequent offeringsof regular voting stock, for such stock would have voting rights greaterthan an outstanding class of common stock of the issuer. While in manycircumstances the subsequent issuance would not be disenfranchising, thistype of interpretive question is best left to the SROs to determine whenimplementing the Rule.c. <T3>Bona fide Mergers and Acquisitions. </T3>Third, the Commission believesthat the issuance of lower voting rights stock in connection with a businesscombination to effect a bona fide merger or acquisition, in which the votingrights of the securities issued would not be greater than the voting rightsof any existing class of common stock, is presumed to be appropriate underthe Rule.\9\\3\<NOTE/> For example, when the lower voting rights stock is structuredso that dividends or other substantive rights (<T3>e.g., </T3>election of directors) are based on the assets or performanceof the acquired company, such a recapitalization generally should be consideredbona fide and consistent with the purposes of the Rule.\9\\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\3\ <T3>See </T3>Proposing Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, at 23671, 23673. The Commission has decided to excludefrom the final rule the phrase ``accompanied by proxy material'' when describingsuch permitted issuances in connection with a business combination or astock dividend. Although, aside from short-form mergers, most mergers andacquisitions are accompanied by proxy material, the Commission notes thatmost issuances of stock dividends do not require shareholder approval.Therefore the inclusion of the phrase ``accompanied by proxy material''in this section of the final rule would be unduly restrictive. <T3>See also </T3>text accompanying notes 95 to 97 <T3>infra </T3>(discussing the issuance of stock dividends). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\4\ The Commission emphasizes that a merger or combinationbetween a company with a disparate voting rights plan and a company witha one share, one vote capitalization must be scrutinized to ensure thatit is being effected for a bona fide purpose. In particular, an attemptto merge a larger company with a single class or stock into a substantiallysmaller company or shell company with a disparate voting rights plan, orany merger other than at arm's length, could be considered disenfranchisingunder the Rule because it might disparately reduce the voting rights ofexisting shareholders. Such mergers would not, however, be presumed prohibitedwhere the proportionality of voting rights between the two companies ismaintained. Again, this would be consistent with the Rule's objective toavoid the disenfranchisement of existing shareholders, by permitting shareholdersto retain their current voting power. d. <T3>Stock Dividends. </T3>Finally, the Commission believes that, in manyinstances, a straight issuance of a stock dividend to all holders of anoutstanding class of common stock, in which the voting rights of the stockare equal to or less than the per share voting rights of the existing class,would be consistent with the rule.\9\\5\<NOTE/> The Rule generally is not meant to restrict additional issuancesof stock with the same voting rights as existing common stock, even thoughsuch issuances may dilute the percentage voting power of shareholders.\9\\6\<NOTE/> An issuance of low vote stock as a dividend, however, alsocould be constructed in a manner to disenfranchise shareholders. For example,the low vote stock could contain transferability restrictions or otherconditions that would cause the issuance to be, in effect, an exchangeoffer. In addition, the issuance could be part of a two-step transactionwhereby voting control of a corporation is acquired by an inside groupwithout purchasing a proportionate percentage of the issuer's equity.\9\\7\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the Commission has not placed a dividend oflow vote stock in either the category of presumptively permitted or prohibitedtransactions. Instead, the SROs should review these transactions to determineif they are consistent with the purposes of the Rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\5\ <T3>See </T3>Proposing Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, at 23673. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\6\ Five commentators suggested that the Rule should permitspinoffs of a company's operations where the spun off subsidiary has thesame dual class structure as the parent company. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Carter-Wallace comment, <T3>supra </T3>note 65. Due to the varied forms that these spinoffs couldtake, the Commission believes that spinoffs should be analyzed by the SROson a case-by-case basis under the Rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\7\ <T3>See </T3>text accompanying note 103 <T3>infra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">2. </ITAG><T3>Prohibited Actions Under the Rule</T3> As adopted, the Rule also contains a non-exclusive list of issuances orother corporate actions presumed to be prohibited under the Rule. Thislist reflects the Commission's belief that the Rule should focus on theprocess by which disparate voting rights plans are created and their effecton existing shareholders. a. <T3>``Time Phased'' Voting.</T3> The Rule presumes to prohibit corporateaction to impose any restriction on voting power of shares based on thelength of time the shareholder has held the stock.\9\\8\<NOTE/> The Commission continues to find troubling the effect ofthese tenured or time phased voting plans, to the extent that shares subjectto time phased voting were not sold as such in the company's initial publicoffering. Those plans usually involve a recapitalization in which all shareholdersat the time of the recapitalization receive multiple votes per share fortheir holdings. Any investor that purchases stock subsequent to the commencementof the plan receives one vote per share unless and until that investorholds the stock for a stated period of time (usually three or four years).In these cases, shareholders generally have purchased stock in the companyat a time when, in the aggregate, outside public shareholders enjoy votingcontrol, or at least, have the potential to obtain voting control if andwhen insiders sell their shares. As outside shareholders sell their highvote shares which converts them to low vote shares, insiders, by holdingtheir shares, gain voting control from the outside shareholders. As a result,public shareholders at the time of the recapitalization will, as a group,be disenfranchised, and the ability of an acquiror of the company's sharesto obtain voting control will be restricted.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\8\ <T3>See </T3>Proposing Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, at 23671-73.   b. <T3>``Capped'' Voting Plans. </T3>The Rule also presumes to prohibit, withone exception,\9\\9\<NOTE/> corporate action to impose any limitation on the voting powerof shares based on the number of shares owned.\1\\0\\0\<NOTE/> So-called capped voting plans generally are designed to insulatemanagement from the threat of a hostile takeover by restricting the abilityof the potential acquiror to obtain voting control. This type of recapitalizationclearly restricts the per share voting power of the large shareholder,and, therefore is presumed to be violative of the Rule. As with tenuredvoting plans, capped voting plans frequently are implemented in companiesin which public shareholders have voting control of the company. By institutinga capped voting plan, shareholders who purchase shares in excess of thetriggering amount are disenfranchised of the voting rights for the excessshares. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\9\ <T3>See </T3>text accompanying notes 123-124, <T3>infra. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\0\ <T3>See </T3>Proposing Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, at 23671-73. Disparate voting rights plans thatlimit the voting power of a shareholder based on the number of shares ownedare commonly referred to as ``capped voting'' plans. These plans simplynullify or significantly restrict the voting rights of a shareholder afterthat shareholder acquires a certain percentage of equity ownership in thecompany (usually 10 or 20%). Generally, these plans provide that a shareholdermay not vote in excess of the threshold, or only may exercise a minimalpercentage of his or her voting rights over that threshold. c. <T3>Super Voting Stock Distributions. </T3>The Rule also presumes to prohibitthe issuance of securities pursuant to a stock dividend or otherwise withvoting rights greater than the per share voting rights of an outstandingclass or classes of common stock.\1\\0\\1\<NOTE/> The Rule then essentially presumes to prohibit all issuancesof super voting stock. The Commission finds such issuances to be coerciveand disenfranchising. Super voting stock usually is employed in recapitalizationsin the following manner: super voting stock is issued as a stock dividendwith transfer restrictions \1\\0\\2\<NOTE/> that require the stock to be converted into lower votingstock if sold. As a result, insiders will be able to gain voting controlof the company by holding the super voting stock received as a dividend,while outside shareholders are forced by the transfer restriction to converttheir super voting stock to limited voting stock when they want to sell.The Commission further believes that, even in situations where no restrictionson transferability are imposed, super voting shares could be issued aspart of a two step transaction whereby voting control of the corporationis acquired without purchasing a proportionate percentage of the issuer'sequity.\1\\0\\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\1\ <T3>See </T3>Proposing Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, at 23671-73. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\2\ Transfer restrictions placed on super voting stockpursuant to a dividend or other distribution-type recapitalization aredesigned to make holding super voting stock more attractive to insidersand other long term holders and less attractive to the outside investor.Generally, these provisions drastically limit the ability of holders tosell their stock by narrowly prescribing the people or entities to whomthe stock can be transferred. Further, these plans usually provide thatwhen the holder does decide to sell, the holder must either sell the supervoting stock back to the company, or convert it to lower voting stock.Accordingly, as with tenured voting plans, as outside shareholders selltheir shares, insiders accrue increasingly greater control at the expenseof the other shareholders. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\3\ For example, a corporation could first issue nonrestrictivesuper voting stock to all shareholders. Insiders could then systematicallyincrease their percentage of control over the company by buying up additionalshares of outstanding super voting stock, using the proceeds from the saleof lower voting stock to effect their purchase. By buying super votingstock to effect their purchase. By buying super voting stock, the insiderscould obtain control through a purchase of far fewer shares than if theybought the lower voting stock.  d. <T3>Exchange Offers. </T3>The Commission believes that the issuance ofdisparate voting rights stock pursuant to an exchange offer should be presumedto be prohibited under the Rule.\1\\0\\4\<NOTE/> These recapitalizations can be structured as a one-time opportunityto receive less than full voting rights stock in exchange for shares ofthe existing class of common stock. For example, a company will issue anew class of lower voting stock with a higher dividend, and make the existingvoting stock convertible into the lower voting, higher dividend stock.In these situations, outside shareholders may be coerced to act in a mannercontrary to their collective economic self-interest.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\4\ <T3>See </T3>Proposing Release, <T3>supra</T3> note 5, at 23671-73.In these transactions, shareholders will face the choice of surrenderingtheir voting control and receiving a small economic benefit (the dividendsweetener), or bypassing the exchange offer and maintaining the greatervoting stock. The exchange offer is coercive because those shareholderswishing to hold the greater voting stock to defeat the plan would be takinga substantial risk that an insufficient number of outside shareholderswill do likewise and majority voting control will shift to insiders. Accordingly,such shareholders may be ``coerced'' individually to opt for lower votingstock with a dividend sweetener to avoid holding ineffective full votingstock, without any dividend benefit. Given the prospect that the shareholderswill be left with neither the increased dividend nor an effective voteif they decide not to participate in the exchange offer, the Commissionbelieves that such offers coerce shareholders into a disenfranchising decision.Even in situations in which shareholders are permitted to convert to lowervoting stock for an extended period, or at any time after a recapitalizationis approved, the collective action limitation still makes it unlikely thatsuch a plan would be defeated. Shareholders in the minority, voting againsta disparate voting rights plan, in this case, also eventually would be``coerced'' by the dividend sweetener to exchange shares and would be disenfranchisedunwillingly.\1\\0\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\5\ The ABA requested clarification as to whether anexchange by the shareholders of common stock for new non-voting debt securitiesor preferred stock, whether not accepted or underaccepted by a controllinggroup of shareholders, would be disenfranchising. The Commission does notbelieve that the form of such a transaction is determinative of whetherthe transaction would be disenfranchising. Rather, each such transactionshould be examined to determine whether it is consistent with the Ruleand, also whether it would fall under one of the actions expressly prohibitedby the Rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. </ITAG><T3>Foreign Issuers</T3>The Commission has decided not to extend Rule 19c-4 to foreign issuers.As noted above, Rule 19c-4 as proposed applied only to domestic issuersand, in the Proposing Release, the Commission solicited comment on whetherthe Rule should be applied to foreign issuers.\1\\0\\6\<NOTE/> Although the majority of commentators indicated that theRule should apply to foreign issuers, the Commission believes there arevalid reasons for not requiring U.S. markets to apply the rule to foreigncompanies.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\6\ <T3>See </T3>text accompanying note 49, <T3>supra</T3>.First, the Commission cannot reasonably expect foreign issuers to act inconnection with voting rights so that they would be permitted to facilitatethe development of a secondary market for their securities in the UnitedStates, especially when U.S. investors already can acquire the securitiesof foreign issuers overseas and the U.S. is not the primary market forthe corporation's shares. This is especially true if the laws, customs,or practices of the home country permit disparate voting rights structures.If the Rule were mandatory for all issuers trading on U.S. markets, itmight have the effect of keeping foreign issuers out of U.S. markets andforcing U.S. investors to trade such securities overseas. Because foreignmarkets may offer less protection to the investor than U.S. markets, U.S.investors could be harmed because they would not be provided the increasedprotection of the U.S. securities laws.\1\\0\\7\<NOTE/> At a minimum, U.S. investors would incur additional transactioncosts in purchasing foreign issuer securities overseas. Finally, becausethe Rule provides only a minimum voting rights standard, the U.S. SROswill be able to apply the Rule (or other appropriate standards) to foreignissuers if, in the SRO's judgment, it is appropriate to extend the Ruleto cover these issuers.\1\\0\\8\<NOTE/> The Commission concludes that investor protection and thepublic interest do not mandate that the Commission require applicationof Rule 19c-4 to all foreign issuers trading in U.S. SROs and that theSROs should be able to make a determination whether an extension of theRule to foreign issuers is appropriate for their market individually.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\7\ This position is consistent with the Commission'sapproval of a proposal by the Amex and NYSE that permits them to waiveor modify certain listing standards for foreign issuers when it can beshown that the foreign company's procedure is based on the laws, customsor practices of its home country. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24634 (June 23, 1987),52 FR 24230. In that Release, the Commission weighed the potential competitivedisadvantage to domestic issuers of allowing certain listing and reportingrequirements to be waived for foreign issuers and concluded that the proposedrules would remove obstacles which have made foreign companies reluctantto list on either the Amex or the NYSE and could result in increased protectionfor U.S. investors. We also note that the rule changes allowed waiver ormodification of voting rights listing standards. <T3>See Id.</T3> at n.21 (discussing foreign issuer rule's relation toproposed Rule 19c-4).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\8\ Of course, any such listing standard would haveto be approved by the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. </ITAG><T3>Grandfather Provision</T3>a. <T3>Effective Date</T3>. As noted above, the Commission is changing thegrandfather date to July 7, 1988, the date of Commission approval of theRule. Rule 19c-4, as proposed, provided that voting rights plans adoptedprior to May 15, 1987, would be unaffected by the Rule. The grandfatherprovision also protected proposed voting rights plans for companies thatsubmitted proxy materials to the Commission prior to May 15, 1987, so longas the issuer moved forward in a reasonable period of time to implementits recapitalization.The Commission initially selected May 15, 1987 as the grandfather datefor several reasons. First, the securities markets and corporate communityhad been aware that the Commission was considering action to restrict theissuance of dual class stock at least since December, 1986.\1\\0\\9\<NOTE/> Second, the Amex, NASD, and NYSE had notified their listedcompanies during the period following the December hearings that May 15,1987 would be the grandfather date used in any uniform approach adoptedby the SROs. Accordingly, in selecting May 15, 1987 the Commission wassatisfied that issuers had sufficient notice concerning a possible restrictionon voting rights plans. Further, the Commission believed that a later datewould, in the interim, induce a rush of companies implementing voting rightsplans that would disenfranchise shareholders primarily to avoid the deadlineimposed by the Rule.\1\\1\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\9\ In December, 1986, the Commission held public hearingson the NYSE's proposal to modify its one share, one vote rule. At thatmeeting, then Chairman Shad and several Commissioners raised questionsconcerning the development of a uniform approach similar to what was subsequentlyproposed as Rule 19c-4.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\\0\ The concern was substantiated by the fact that inthe first four months of 1987, when there were indications that the SROsor the Commission might restrict disparate voting rights plans, approximately25 major domestic corporations initiated a disparate voting rights plan.As noted above, the Commission received numerous comments specificallyaddressing the grandfather issue, ranging from arguments that there shouldbe no grandfathering of existing dual class plans,\111\<NOTE/> to comments urging that the grandfather date be later thanMay 15.\112\<NOTE/> Further, many of the corporate commentators argued that theRule should be applied prospectively only, and that to do otherwise wouldconstitute a violation of the notice requirement of the AdministrativeProcedure Act (``APA'').\113\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\111\ <T3>See </T3>text accompanying notes 45 to 48, <T3>supra</T3>.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\112\ <T3>See </T3>text accompanying notes 65 to 66, <T3>supra</T3>.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\113\ <T3>See </T3>ABA comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 50, at 24, n.10; Carter-Wallace comment, <T3>supra </T3>note 65, at 16-24; Times Mirror comment, <T3>supra </T3>note 65, at 16.The Commission believes that companies were on notice of potential Commissionaction concerning disparate voting rights plans as of May 15, 1987. Dueto the length of time since the issuance of the Proposing Release, however,the Commission has concluded not to apply the Rule to those companies thatadopted disparate voting rights plans prior to the Rule's effective date.Second, the Commission estimates that since May 15 only 17 companies haverecapitalized or filed plans to recapitalize with the Commission. Accordingly,not many classes of shareholders should be affected by the change in theRule's application date.\114\<NOTE/> We do, however, specifically reject any further delay pastthe effective date in requiring companies to comply with the Rule.\115\<NOTE/> Such a delay would create an inappropriate ``window of opportunity''for companies to rush to disenfranchise shareholders.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\114\ This does not mean that the Commission is not concernedabout those shareholders that were, in fact, disenfranchised between May15, 1987 and the adoption of the Rule. Nevertheless, we believe the concernsnoted below dictate applying the Rule as of the Rule's effective date.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\115\ <T3>See </T3>text accompanying notes 116-117 <T3>infra </T3>(discussing application of Rule to those companies thatrecently had approved a disparate voting rights plan but have not yet actuallyissued stock under the plan).Additionally, we note that the SROs would still retain the right, consistentwith section 9(g) of the Act, to enforce compliance with their rules bydelisting or requiring a shareholder ratification vote with respect toany issuer that recapitalized in violation of SRO listing standards beforeRule 19c-4 was approved (<T3>e.g., </T3>NYSE companies that recapitalized during the moratorium).Indeed, the Commission requests that SROs address whether a requirementfor public shareholder ratification for recent recapitalizations, similarto that contained in the NYSE's proposed rule, would be an appropriatesupplement to Rule 19c-4.The Commission finds good cause for establishing an effective date priorto 30 days after publication of the approval order in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> As mentioned above, setting an effective dateafter the date of adoption would allow additional companies to disenfranchiseshareholders in an effort to recapitalize before the Rule's effectiveness.Moreover, immediate implementation of the Rule would place no burden oncompanies without such plans.b. <T3>Effect on Existing Disparate Voting Rights Plans. </T3>The applicationof the Rule raises a number of interpretive questions for companies thathave disparate voting rights plans subject to the Rule's grandfather provision.The Commission has determined to apply the grandfather provision in a mannerthat permits grandfathered plans to operate as adopted, but does not permitexisting holders of an outstanding class or classes of common stock tobe further disenfranchised through subsequent issuances or recapitalizations.First, the Commission has determined that the tenured or capped votingfeatures of disparate voting rights plans should be allowed to continue,provided that the structure was implemented as of the effective date ofthe Rule, despite the fact that the aggregation by management of supervoting shares or the limitation of voting rights of a large holder mightnot occur for a number of years. The Commission believes that any grandfatheringof these types of long range disparate voting rights plans would be meaninglessif limited to a period immediately following the promulgation of the Rule.A related issue is whether disparate classes of stock or disparate votingrights plans authorized but unissued or not implemented prior to the Rule'seffective date should be permitted to be implemented after the effectivedate of the Rule. In the Proposing Release, the Commission stated thata company filing proxy materials by May 15, 1987 to adopt a disparate votingrights plan would be grandfathered, provided the company moved forwardin a reasonable period of time to implement the plan.\116\<NOTE/> In structuring the grandfathering provision as such, theCommission was attempting to exclude two groups: (1) Companies that soughtshareholder authorization after the publication of the Proposing Releaseand knew or should have known that such an issuance likely would be prohibited;and (2) companies that have had blank check preferred or other unissuedsecurities on the shelf as a protective measure and had demonstrated noindication, until the commencement of the section 19(c) proceedings, thatthey intended to issue disparate classes of stock.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\116\ The Commission believed that it would be inappropriateto extend the grandfather exception to companies that had not at leasttaken the step of prosposing the stock issuance for a shareholder vote.<T3>See </T3>Proposing Release, <T3>supra </T3>note 5, n.88.Despite the fact that the Commission is essentially grandfathering allissuers who issued disparate voting stock prior to the Rule's effectivedate, the Commission's concern about authorized but unissued dual classstocks remains valid. The Commission is sensitive to the needs of thosecompanies that received specific shareholder approval for disparate votingrights plans prior to the Rule's effective date, but chose not to implementthem because of concern that the plan would have to be dismantled if itwere prohibited by the Commission's Rule.\117\<NOTE/> Therefore, the Commission has determined that companies thatfiled proxy materials between January 1, 1987 and the Rule's effectivedate to issue disparate voting rights stock, but have yet to issue thedisparate class or classes of stock, should have 90 days following publicationof the Rule, as adopted, in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>to issue their disparate voting rights stock.The Commission believes that this interpretation is consistent with itsview that only those companies that have proceeded within a ``reasonableperiod of time'' to adopt a dual class plan should be permitted to issueauthorized dual class stock after the Rule's effective date.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\117\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>letter from J. Spratt White, Senior Vice President,Springs Industries, Inc., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated July14, 1987.With respect to the subsequent issuance of additional authorized stockas dividends or stock splits, such an issuance may be permitted if it doesnot exacerbate the disparity in voting rights between classes or groupsof shareholders. For example, super voting stock may be issued to existingsuper voting holders in a grandfathered disparate plan only if there areno transferability restrictions and all holders, both super and limited,receive a proportionate amount of securities such that the relative votingpower of the lower voting stock toward the super voting stock is not reduced.Similarly, a reverse stock split could occur in a grandfathered disparatevoting rights plan, but only if the split was applied to all classes ofvoting stock in a proportionate manner. The Commission believes that thisanalysis is consistent with the Rule because the voting power of the existingshareholders is not disparately reduced by the additional issuance.Consistent with this position, the Commission believes that the subsequentissuance of options or convertible rights to purchase super voting stockis inconsistent with the Rule.\118\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that such issuances could be usedto deteriorate further the voting rights of the holders of limited votingstock, and therefore such options and convertible rights to purchase supervoting shares should be changed to rights to purchase non-super votingshares. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\118\Stock options or convertible rights to purchase supervoting stock that were issued before the effective date of the Rule, however,would be ``grandfathered'' and thus could be exercised at any time. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Application of Rule 19c-4 to Control Share Acquisition Statutesand Other Takeover Defenses </ITAG>As noted above, commentators expressed concern regarding the potentialimpact of the proposed Rule on state anti-takeover statutes and other corporatetactics designed to discourage hostile takeovers.\119\<NOTE/> In particular, these commentators questioned the applicationof the Rule to state control share acquisition statutes, such as the Indianastatute upheld by the Supreme Court in the <T3>CTS</T3> decision, and other prevalent defensive tactics, such as poisonpills. The Commission, when proposing the Rule, did not view it as a meansto prohibit corporate defensive tactics in general, but merely as a prohibitionagainst the disenfranchisement of existing shareholders' voting rights.\120\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\119\<T3>See</T3> text accompanying notes 59 to 62, <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\120\In this regard, the Commission does not agree with severalcommentators that the Rule would violate the Williams Act's principle ofneutrality in the regulation of tender offers. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>International Paper comments, <T3>supra</T3> note 61. The Rule is not intended to address defensive tactics,but to protect shareholder voting rights. Moreover, companies would retainthe full panoply of defensive tactics, as long as a particular tactic didnot disenfranchise shareholders. a. <T3>Control Share Acquisition Statutes</T3>. Specifically, commentatorshave questioned whether corporate action pursuant to control share acquisitionstatutes would constitute an issuance of securities or other corporateaction that disenfranchises shareholders.\121\<NOTE/> In light of the <T3>CTS</T3> decision and the purposes of the Rule, the Commission hasrevised the Rule to clarify that it would not interfere with these statutes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\121\Ind. Code section 23-1-42-1 <T3>et seq.</T3> (1986). The Indiana Control Share Acquisitions Chapteris the forerunner of a number of state statutes designed to protect domesticcorporations from hostile takeovers. Briefly, the statute provides thatif a shareholder acquires 20% or more of the voting stock needed to electdirectors of an Indiana corporation, the shareholder loses its right tovote the shares unless the disinterested shareholders vote to grant the``control'' shareholder voting rights within 50 days of the commencementof the offer to purchase the shares. All Indiana corporations are coveredby the statute, unless the corporation amends its articles of incorporationor by-laws to opt out of the statute. The Commission believes that deference to state-legislated control shareacquisition statutes designed to specifically regulate changes in controlis appropriate. We note that the SROs, in setting and enforcing their listingstandards, historically have attempted to distinguish between areas inwhich generalized threshold standards have been set by the states and thoseareas in which the states have chosen specifically to regulate. For example,the NYSE traditionally has placed limitations on the listing of non-votingor lower voting stock, despite the presence of general state enabling legislationthat permit corporations to have disparate voting stock. The NYSE, however,has deferred to state law in other areas of corporate governance, suchas the rights of preferred shareholders to vote on mergers and acquisitions,when the states have chosen specifically to regulate or limit corporateactivity.\122\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the Commission has determined that the Ruleshould not apply to corporate action taken pursuant to state law requiringa state's domestic corporation to condition the voting rights of a beneficialor record holder of a specified threshold percentage of the corporation'svoting stock on the approval of the corporation's independent shareholders.\123\<NOTE/> Consistent with this change, the Commission believes thatthe definition of the phrase ``corporate action'' in paragraph (d)(4) ofthe Rule should be read so as to include compliance with control shareacquisition statutes by: (1) Reincorporating in a state that has such astatute; or (2) failing to opt-out of such a statute.\124\<NOTE/> Outside of the state statutes permitted in paragraph (d)(4)of the Rule, it is possible that states will enact other types of statutesthat limit shareholder voting rights in certain situations. The Commissionbelieves that determinations as to whether corporate action pursuant toany such statute is consistent with the purposes of the Rule is best leftto the SROs. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\122\<T3>See</T3> NYSE listed Company Manual section 308.00. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\123\<T3>E.g.,</T3> Ind. Code section 23-1-42-1 <T3>et seq.</T3> (1986); Del. Code, Title 8, section 203); and N.Y. Bus.Corp. Law section 912 (McKinney 1986). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\124\The Commission's position is limited to the applicabilityof Rule 19c-4 to control share acquisition statutes. Accordingly, nothingdiscussed herein should be construed to indicate that the Commission believessuch statutes are appropriate or that the Commission will not participateas amicus curiae opposing such statutes on Federal pre-emption and CommerceClause constitutional grounds in the future. <T3>See</T3> Briefs of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Amicus Curiae,<T3>Salant Acquisition Corp.</T3> v. <T3>Manhattan Industries, Inc., </T3>88 Civ. 686, (S.D.N.Y., March 16,1988); <T3>RTE Corporation</T3> v. <T3>Mark IV Industries, Inc.</T3> and <T3>MIV Holdings, Inc.</T3> v. <T3>Loren D.

The Commission does not believe, however, that corporate voting structuresrequired by a state or Federal statute, with no opportunity provided forthe corporation to opt out of such requirement, involve corporate actionwhich would be covered by the Rule.\125\<NOTE/> Moreover, reincorporation into a state with such a statutewould not constitute corporate action under the Rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\125\<T3>See</T3> text accompanying notes 134 to 135 <T3>infra.</T3> b. <T3>Shareholder Rights Plans. </T3>Commentators also have questioned theeffect of Rule 19c-4 on tender offer defensive shareholder rights plans.\1\\2\\6\<NOTE/> Because some of these so-called ``poison pills'' can be viewedas diluting the voting rights of a potential acquiror or large shareholderby allowing stock to be sold below market value to a specific shareholderor shareholders, some commentators expressed concern that the implementationof a poison pill would be considered disenfranchising under the Rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\\6\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Fried, Frank comment, <T3>supra </T3>note 50, at 7-20. Predominantly, these inquiries questionedthe applicability of the Rule to so-called flip-in shareholder rights plans.Under certain flip-in plans, rights or warrants are attached to the commonstock of a company, entitling the holder, upon the right being triggered,to buy additional shares of common stock at a price substantially belowmarket value. These rights generally are redeemable at any time by theBoard of Directors of the company prior to being triggered and exercisesd.The rights, however, are not exercisable until the occurrence of a so-calledtriggering event, usually the acquisition of a specified percentage ofthe company's stock by a hostile bidder or the commencement of a tenderoffer. Upon the occurrence of the triggering event, all shareholders exceptthe potential acquiror may then purchase shares at below market value,crippling the takeover effort by the acquiror.The Commission has determined that such plans generally should not be coveredby the Rule. As with any recapitalization or disparate voting rights plan,the focus should be placed upon the effect of the plan on the voting rightsof existing shareholders. It is important, therefore, to note that unliketransactions prohibited by the Rule, shareholder rights plans are not adoptedto restructure a corporation by disenfranchising an existing class or classesof shareholders in order to solidify the voting power of management ora control group. Rather, these plans are adopted by corporations to discouragetender offers, or to encourage the development of an auction for the companyresulting in shareholders receiving a higher price for their stock.\1\\2\\7\<NOTE/> In fact such plans are adopted with the intent that theywill never be implemented.\1\\2\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\\7\ Further, it is important to note that although theNYSE has prohibited disparate voting rights stock for over 60 years, ithas differentiated between disparate voting rights plans in general andshareholder rights plans that are adopted to discourage hostile takeovers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\\8\ The Commission emphasizes, however, that its positionon anti-takeover shareholder rights plans should not be misconstrued asa blanket exception for all restructurings adopted under the guise of a``poison pill.'' If a corporation develops an anti-takeover device designedspecifically to transfer voting control from existing shareholders to insiders,or a group favored by insiders, it may violate Rule 19c-4 irrespectiveof the fact that it is termed a ``poison pill.'' The Commission notes thatseveral firms have adopted ``poison pills'' which would affect voting rightsof a large purchaser of the company's stock. <T3>See, e.g., Asarco, Inc. v. MRH Holmes A Court, </T3>611 F. Supp. 468(D.N.J. 1985). Moreover, the Commission also emphasizes that its decisionto exclude poison pills from coverage of Rule 19c-4 should not be construedas implying either acceptance or rejection of the argument that poisonpills can, in some circumstances, have discriminatory or disenfranchisingeffects.c. <T3>Lock-Ups. </T3>Commentators also questioned the effect Rule 19c-4 wouldhave on the use of lock-ups, in which newly issued shares or options tobuy additional shares, often at a discount, are issued to another party.Several commentators have questioned whether the purchase of additionalshares, through a lock-up, at below market cost would disparately reducethe voting rights of existing shareholders. The Commission believes thatlock-ups generally would not be prohibited by Rule 19c-4.\1\\2\\9\<NOTE/>. The Commission believes that the fairness of the compensationpaid for voting stock generally should be determined by state law, withthe addition of possible shareholder voting requirements imposed by SROrules.\1\\3\\0\<NOTE/> Moreover, the Commission notes that a substantial body ofstate judicial decisions, applying general fiduciary and duty of loyaltyprinciples, have accorded greater scrutiny to lock-up transactions, especiallyin regard to contests for corporate control.\1\\3\\1\<NOTE/> Nevertheless, lock-ups effected by the sale of super votingpreferred would be presumed to be prohibited under the Rule because theywould involve an issuance of a new class of super voting stock, which presumablyis prohibited under the Rule.\1\\3\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\\9\ This is consistent with the views discussed aboveconcerning flip-in plans. <T3>See </T3>text accompanying notes 126-128 <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\\0\ For example, Section 312 of the NYSE's Listed CompanyManual requires shareholder approval where additional issuances of stockin an acquisition would increase the outstanding common stock by 18\1/2\%or more. <T3>See also </T3>section 712 of the Amex Company Guide. The Commissionbelieves that the NASD should consider adoptiong a similar rule when implementingRule 19c-4.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\\1\ <T3>See </T3>Terrell,'' The Delaware Business Judgment Rule In a High RiskEnvironment'' <T3>Representing Publicly Traded Corporations: Advising Corporate Managementin a High Risk Environment </T3>526 P.L.I. May-June 1987, at 459.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\\2\ The Commission also notes that fair pricing provisionsthat require approval of a tender offer by a majority or super majorityof disinterested shareholders are not covered by the Rule's prohibitionsbecause no corporate action is being taken to disenfranchise shareholders.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Other Interpretative Issues</ITAG>In the Proposing Release, the Commission requested comment on a varietyof issues. These issues included whether certain issuers or securitiesshould be exempted explicitly from the Rule; the applicability of the Ruleto so-called two-step transactions in which a company goes private andsubsequently goes public with an issuance of disparate voting stock; theeffect of the Rule on companies in financial distress; whether a companyshould be barred from listing for violating Rule 19c-4, or should be ableto take some curative action; and the effect of the Rule upon certain boardand voting structures.\1\\3\\3\<NOTE/> These and other interpretive issues are discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\\3\ <T3>See </T3>Proposing Release <T3>supra </T3>note 5, at 23673-74.a. <T3>Statutory Restrictions.</T3> In response to the Proposing Release,several commenters noted that the voting rights of companies in certainindustries might be subject to certain mandatory restrictions by applicablestate and federal law.\1\\3\\4\<NOTE/> The Commission recognizes the potential conflict betweenRule 19c-4 and these statutes, and has concluded that the Rule should notcover action taken pursuant to such specific state or federal statutoryrequirements. The Commission notes that in such circumstances the issuerwould not be required to obtain a waiver from compliance with the Rulebecause the alleged disenfranchising action is state or federal action,not corporate action.\1\\3\\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\\4\ <T3>See,</T3> <T3>e.g.,</T3> ABA comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 50, at 27-28 (concerning Federal Home Loan Bank Board[``FHLBB''] regulation that limits voting rights of a potential acquirorto 10% in certain circumstances); letter from Royce N. Sanner, Senior VicePresident, Northwestern National Life Insurance Company, to Jonathan G.Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated August 4, 1987 (Minnesota statute that capsvoting rights of shareholders and provides certain voting rights to policyholders);letter from James T. Lloyd, Vice President, U.S. Air Group, to JonathanG. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated July 16, 1987 (Federal Aviation Authoritylimits on voting rights of foreign stockholders). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\\5\ We note that such companies complying with a stateor federal regulation would not obtain a blanket exemption from all aspectsof the Rule, but simply those aspects necessary to comply with the mandatoryrequirement. For example, although the FHLBB rule permits banks to approvea charter provision to extend the mandatory voting restriction describedin note 134 <T3>supra</T3> for 3 to 5 years, such voluntary action by an issuer wouldbe considered corporate action prohibited by the Rule. b. <T3>Going Private Transactions.</T3> In the Proposing Release, the Commissionexpressed concern that the process by which a company is taken privateand subsequently goes public within a brief period could have a disenfranchisingeffect on existing shareholders.\1\\3\\6\<NOTE/> In response to the Commission's solicitation of comments,certain commentators objected to the labelling of such a two-step transactionas disenfranchising.\1\\3\\7\<NOTE/> The Commission notes that, when a company is taken private,existing shareholders are required to be paid fair value for their stockand therefore are not disenfranchised. Indeed, in such a transaction, shareholdersare not just relinquishing voting rights, but are selling their entireinterest in a security. When the company subsequently goes public, regardlessof the elapsed period of time since being taken private, purchasers, throughproper disclosure, will be aware of the lack of voting control in the stockbeing purchased, just as with any IPO.\1\\3\\8\<NOTE/> In both the going private transaction and subsequent initialpublic offering, the transactions are subject to market discipline. Inlight of these arguments, the Commission agrees that the above-cited transactionis not disenfranchising.\1\\3\\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\\6\ Proposing Release, <T3>supra</T3> note 5, at n.93. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\\7\ <T3>See</T3> Gilson comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 25, at 3-4; International Paper comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 61, at 11. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\\8\ <T3>See</T3> Gilson comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 25, at 3-4. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\\9\ The same analysis would apply to a partial tenderoffer for cash, which, by itself, would not be disenfranchising under theRule. c. <T3>Distress Situations.</T3> Several commenters urged the Commission toconsider the effect of the Rule on companies in financial distress.\1\\4\\0\<NOTE/> These commentators questioned whether an arrangement by whicha party infuses capital into a company in financial distress in exchangefor voting control or super voting stock would be considered disenfranchisingunder the Rule. After considering the arguments of the commentators, theCommission concludes that the financial distress situation should be resolvedby the individual SROs pursuant to their authority to adopt exemptive rulesunder paragraph (f) of the Rule. The SROs, among other factors, shouldevaluate whether the proposed recapitalization is part of a plan to rescuethe company. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\\0\ <T3>See</T3> letter from D.N. Maytum, Secretary, Chevron Corporation, toJonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated August 3, 1987; letter from Mudge,Rose, Guthrie, Alexander and Ferdon (counsel to Western Union) to JonathanG. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated August 7, 1987. d. <T3>Working Control.</T3> Another related comment questions whether theRule should apply to companies that already have substantial insider votingcontrol (<T3>e.g.,</T3> over 50%). The Commission recognizes two conflicting concerns.First, in a company where insiders have substantial control (so-called``working control'') minority shareholders still should have a right tobe protected from further disenfranchisement. On the other hand, if minorityshareholders have little or no existing control vis-a-vis a majority controlgroup, the Rule's protection will not necessarily benefit the minorityshareholders. Nevertheless, the Commission believes it would be difficultand arbitrary, prior to the Rule's promulgation, to set a specific exceptionunder the Rule based on the percentage of insider control. e. <T3>Board Composition.</T3> Some commentators have raised questions concerningspecific voting provisions in regard to board elections. The Commissionnotes that these provisions will be considered disenfranchising only ifthey restrict the voting rights of a class or classes of stock. For example,a recapitalization that creates two classes of stock, each having one voteper share, in which one class elects a percentage of the board disproportionateto its equity interest, would be violative of the Rule. In contrast, staggeredboard elections or cumulative voting provisions would not disenfranchiseholders of a class or classes of stock and therefore would not violatethe Rule. f. <T3>Limited Partnerships.</T3> Commentators also have raised concerns overwhether the reorganization of a company to a limited partnership form wouldbe considered a transaction that disparately reduces the voting rightsof the holders of the common stock in violation of Rule 19c-4.\1\\4\\1\<NOTE/> There are fundamental tax reasons for a corporation to chooseto recapitalize to a limited partnership form. According to applicableTreasury Regulations, however, a limited partnership will be taxed as acorporation if it possesses more corporate than non-corporate characteristics.\1\\4\\2\<NOTE/> Accordingly, most limited partnerships do not provide thelimited partners with the right to vote except in very limited circumstances.Thus, a switch from corporate to partnership form necessarily would reducevoting rights of existing shareholders. Such a switch, however, goes farbeyond voting rights and substantially changes the nature of the investment,as opposed to the mere adoption of a disparate voting rights structure.Accordingly, the Commission believes that so long as a corporation hasa bona fide business reason for transferring to a limited partnership form,other than to reduce the voting rights of existing shareholders, it shouldbe a permitted transaction under Rule 19c-4.\1\\4\\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\\1\ <T3>See</T3> Business Roundtable comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 50, at 30-31. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\\2\ <T3>See</T3> Treas. Reg. andSection; 301.7701-2. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\\3\ We note that, in recognition of the fact that limitedpartners generally do not have the right to vote, the NYSE historicallyhas not applied its one share, one vote rule to master limited partnerships.g. <T3>Cure.</T3> Finally, in the Proposing Release the Commission specificallysolicited comment on whether companies delisted due to Rule 19c-4 shouldbe permitted to ``cure'' the disenfranchisement and re-establish a tradingmarket in a national securities exchange or association after a certainperiod of time. Commentators addressing this question indicated that acure should be anywhere from one year to at least seven years after theprohibited action.\1\\4\\4\<NOTE/> The Commission has decided not to place a specific ``cure''period in the Rule. Instead, the Commission will consider proposed rulechanges by the SROs that would permit issuers to ``cure'' the defect andre-establish a public trading market. Factors the SROs should considerin deciding whether to propose such a rule change would include the lengthof time since the disenfranchising action, the proposed cure, the purposeand use of the recapitalization while it was in place, and any other circumstancesthat would be relevant to permit a company to relist on an exchange orbe reauthorized by an association. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\\4\ <T3>See</T3> letter from Alice E. Hennessey, Senior Vice President, BoiseCascade Corporation, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated July 14,1987 (no more than 1 or 2 years); FAF comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 39, at 2 (7 years at least). h. <T3>Other Situations.</T3> Aside from the situations discussed above, thereare likely to be further requests for clarification or interpretation ofthe Rule's coverage. For example, the Rule is drafted expressly to permitcertain disparate stock issuances in registered public offerings. Somepublic offerings need not be registered with the Commission (<T3>e.g.</T3>, offerings of securities exempt under sections (3)(a)(10)and 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act of 1933). Rather than address this situationin this Release, the Commission will rely upon the SROs' implementationof the Rule to provide further guidance. C. Commission Authority to Adopt Rule 19c-4 The Commission believes that, in adopting Rule 19c-4, it has met the statutorystandards necessary to add to the rules of an SRO as set forth under section19(c) of the Act. Although commentators continue to question the authorityof the Commission to amend SRO listing standards pursuant to its 19(c)authority,\1\\4\\5\<NOTE/> the Commission has concluded that Rule 19c-4 is consistentwith the Act and in furtherance of the objectives of sections 6, 11A, 14,15A, and 19 of the Act, in that it will protect against shareholder disenfranchisementand increase investor confidence in the securities markets in the UnitedStates. Moreover, the Commission, in crafting the Rule, sought to minimizethe Rule's impact on areas traditionally subject to state regulation.\1\\4\\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\\5\ The commentators critical of the Commission's authorityto promulgate Rule 19c-4 generally fall within two main categories. First,they argue that Congress never intended the Commission to have rulemakingauthority under Section 19(c) of the Act to modify exchange listing standardsto impose corporate governance requirements on issuers.

The Commission disagrees with this analysis. The languageof section 19(c) does not suggest that the scope of Commission jurisdictionover SRO rules varies depending on the type or content of the SRO ruleinvolved.\1\\5\\3\<NOTE/> Rather, the rulemaking authority over SRO rules providedin section 19(c) explicitly extends to all purposes of the Exchange Actwithout limitation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\2\ <T3>See</T3> ABA comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 50, at 12-13.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\3\ <T3>See</T3><T3> Aaron </T3>v.

Prior to the 1975 Amendmentsto the Act, section 19(b) identified specified types of exchange rulesas illustrative of the type of rules that the Commission was authorizedto alter or supplement. Exchange listing and delisting standards were amongthe types of rules so identified. In the 1975 Amendments, however, Congressdid not follow the pattern established in original section 19(b). Instead,the Committee Report accompanying the Senate version of the 1975 Amendmentsindicated that the broad language of section 19(c) was intended to providethe Commission with ``authority to amend [SRO] rules in any manner in furtheranceof the objectives of the Exchange Act.'' \1\\5\\4\<NOTE/> Accordingly, because listing standards are rules of an SRO,as defined under the Act, and because such listing standards were recognizedSRO rules when Congress conferred upon the Commission authority to amendsuch rules, Congress presumably intended the Commission to have the authorityunder section 19(c) to amend such rules if such an amendment is necessaryor appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\4\ Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing andamp; Urb.

Senator Harrison Williams, a principal architect of the1975 Amendments, clearly was aware of the Commission's activity in thelisting standards area. In March 1974, he submitted a letter to the Commissionarguing that the Commission should ``disapprove'' the Amex rule filing.Letter from Harrison Williams, U.S. Senator, to Ray Garrett, Jr., Chairman,SEC, dated March 22, 1974.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><T3>See also</T3>, letter from Paul Kolton, Chairman, Amex, to Ronald Hunt,Secretary, SEC, dated July 20, 1973 (requesting the Commission to review,pursuant to Sections 6 and 19 of the Act, an NYSE listing standard rulechange).Other commentators argued that the SROs' lack of enforcement authorityover issuers negates any Commission authority to require the SROs to imposerules affecting issuers.\1\\5\\5\<NOTE/> These commentators suggested that SROs are not obligatedto enforce listing standards against issuers because section 19(g) of theAct \1\\5\\6\<NOTE/> requires that an SRO enforce compliance with its rules onlyby its members or their associated persons, and section 19(h) of the Actdoes not authorize the Commission to discipline an SRO for failing to enforcecompliance with its rules by issuers.\1\\5\\7\<NOTE/> These commentators argued that it would be meaningless forthe Commission to impose upon SROs a rule that they were not required toenforce.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\5\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Carter-Wallace comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 65, at 33-35.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\6\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(g).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\7\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(h).This argument ignores two basic points. First, exchanges do not requirespecific enforcement authority against issuers to enforce their listingstandards; they need only deny listing to securities not meeting thosestandards. Moreover, section 19(h) of the Act authorizes the Commissionto bring an enforcement action against any SRO that fails to comply withits own rules. Therefore, failure by an SRO to apply its listing standards,or action by an SRO to enforce them in a manner inconsistent with its rules,would subject the SRO to discipline by the Commission. Further, notwithstandingthe enforcement responsibilities of SROs vis-a-vis issuers, the SROs, asa condition of their registration, must have the ``capacity to be ableto carry out the purposes of [the Act].'' \1\\5\\8\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the Commission continues to believe that sections19 (g) and (h) provide no basis for ignoring the clear language of section19(c).\1\\5\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\8\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(1), 78<T3>o</T3>-3(b)(2). <T3>See</T3> text accompanying notes 160 to 180 <T3>infra</T3> (discussing purposes furthered by promulgation of Rule 19c-4).We also note that Congress added the requirement that SROs comply withtheir own rules when it deleted the issuer enforcement requirement. Theinference from this action is that Congress sought to ensure that SRO'sown rules regarding issuers would be followed even absent a direct obligation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\\9\ As a practical matter, the different treatment ofissuers can be easily explained. SROs can fine, censure or expel from membershiptheir members and the associated persons of such members. In contrast,SROs, as a practical matter, only may delist their issuers, they may notfine or censure issuers listed on their markets. Accordingly, the statuterecognizes that, apart from following their listing standards, SROs arenot expected, under Section 19(g) of the Act, ``to enforce compliance''(<T3>i.e., </T3>issue fines or censures) against their issuers. <T3>Compare </T3>sections 6(b)(6) and 15A(b)(7) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(6),78<T3>o</T3>-3(b)(7)) (authorizing expulsion, suspension, limitations onactivities, fines and censure of members and persons associated with members)<T3>with</T3> section 12(d) of the Act (authorizing a security to ``bewithdrawn or stricken from listing and registration in accordance withthe rules of the exchange'').<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Rule 19c-4 is Necessary or Appropriate in Furtherance of the Purposeof the Act</ITAG>The Commission's concerns regarding the adoption of certain disparate votingrights plans arise because such plans can deprive existing shareholdersof their voting rights in a coercive or involuntary manner. If the removalor limitation of voting rights or the creation of dual class stock is notsubject to the discipline of the marketplace (<T3>e.g.,</T3> in the case of a public offering), existing shareholderscan be disenfranchised of their right to have an impact on any future corporatedecisions, as well as potentially their right to receive a control premiumfrom a tender offer. When shareholders purchase a security, they do sowith the reasonable expectation that they and their successors will retaintheir voting rights until they choose to relinquish them in a transactionsubject to market discipline. The Commission is concerned that disenfranchisement,by overturning these expectations, may result in diminishing investor confidencein the securities markets.Based on the above, as well as the analysis contained in this order, theCommission believes that it is necessary in furtherance of the purposesof sections 6, 11A, 14, 15A and 23 of the Act, to protect investors andthe public interest from disparate voting rights plans that disenfranchiseexisting shareholders. Even, however, if the Commission could not makethe determination that the Rule is necessary in furtherance of the Act,based upon the analysis contained in this order, we clearly find the Ruleappropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.\160\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\160\ Section 19(c) of the Act allows the Commission to amendSRO rules as it deems necessary <T3>or</T3> appropriate.The Commission believes that Rule 19c-4 furthers the purposes of sections14 (a) and (b) of the Act, which are intended to ensure fair shareholdersuffrage.\161\<NOTE/> Certain commentators argued that the Commission can protectfair shareholder suffrage only through regulation of the proxy process.Under this view, when enacting section 14, Congress' sole concern was thesolicitation of proxies and not shareholder voting rights.\162\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that the concerns of Congress inenacting Section 14 were broader. The 1934 House Report on the proposedSecurities Exchange Bill describes the broad purpose of section 14(a):<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\161\ 15 U.S.C. 78n (a), (b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\162\ <T3>See</T3> ABA comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 50, at 16-18.<ITAG tagnum="21">Inasmuch as only the exchanges make it possible for securities tobe widely distributed among the investing public, it follows as a corollarythat the use of the exchanges should involve a corresponding duty of accordingshareholders fair suffrage.\163\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\163\ H.R.

Professor Loss noted that the Commission's power under section14(a) is not limited to requiring disclosure, and that the statutory languageof the Section is more general than the language under the specific disclosurephilosophy of the Securities Act of 1933.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The widespread implementation of disparate corporate voting structureswould render meaningless the purposes underlying Section 14(a). Moreover,it is not surprising that Congress did not attempt to regulate shareholdervoting rights directly. Congress' assumption that securities holders possessedeffective voting power was based on the NYSE's existing and widely publicizedpolicy against listing non-voting and lower voting common stock. In lightof the NYSE's position as the principal national securities market, Congresswas able to base its statutory scheme on existing protections against disparatevoting structures.Section 14(a) contains an implicit assumption that shareholders will beable to make use of the information provided in proxy solicitations inorder to vote in corporate elections. This is supported by the legislativehistory of section 14(a), which states, ``[f]air corporate suffrage isan important right that should attach to every equity security bought ona public exchange.'' \164\<NOTE/> Accordingly, with Rule 19c-4, the rules of the SROs willfurther the shareholder suffrage policy reflected in the section 14(a)proxy requirements by preventing the disenfranchisement of existing shareholdersthrough transactions that are not fully subject to market discipline. Indeed,the disenfranchisement of shareholders could render ineffective the proxyprotections embodied in section 14.\165\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\164\ H.R. Rep. No. 1383, <T3>supra</T3> note 163, at 13.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\165\ Moreover, in adopting section 14(b) of the Act, Congresssought to facilitate effective voting by beneficial shareholders in corporateelections, in part to reduce management dominance of elections throughobtaining blank proxies from brokers and other custodial holders of securities.Section 14(b) provided the Commission with extensive rulemaking authoritywith respect to proxies on securities carried for customers. <T3>See Stock Exchange Practices: Hearings before the Senate Comm. on Bankingandamp; Currency,</T3> 73rd Cong., 1st Sess., 6677, 7711-12 (1934).Other commentators argued that any assumption by the Commission that thescope of section 14(a) extends beyond the proxy process is undercut bythe failure of the 1964 amendments to the Act to extend voting rights standardsto over-the-counter (``OTC'') securities and by the existence of listingstandards on the Amex that permitted disparate voting rights plans at thetime of the 1975 Amendments.\166\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\166\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> ACG comment, <T3>supra</T3> note 60, at 3.The Commission is not persuaded that Congress was unconcerned with shareholdersuffrage when it applied section 14 to the OTC market without specificallyaddressing the absence of voting rights standards in that market. The SenateReport in the 1964 amendments noted that ``[t]he purpose of the section(Section 14) and the Commission rules thereunder is to provide shareholderswith an opportunity to exercise their corporate franchise on the basisof accurate and adequate information.'' \167\<NOTE/> Although the legislative history to the 1964 amendments isnot more explicit regarding shareholders suffrage, we believe that thecommentators' argument assumes too much from congressional silence.\168\<NOTE/> Until recent concerns over tender offer defensive tactics,relatively few companies had disparate voting stock. Moreover, those companiesthat did have such structures generally were family controlled and hadmaintained their voting structure for some time. It would be wrong to construeCongressional inattentiveness to this issue in 1964 as a determinationthat the Commission did not have authority to address, through a section19(c) proceeding, the dramatic increase in disenfranchising recapitalizations.The Commission also notes that initially the Act focused on exchange-listedsecurities because, as noted above, Congress believed that only the exchangesmade it possible for securities to be widely distributed among the investingpublic. Not until the 1970s and 1980s, with the emergence of NASDAQ, coupledwith the increased incidence of hostile takeovers, did the question ofNASDAQ eligibility criteria concerning voting rights take on significance.In light of the foregoing, the Commission views proposed Rule 19c-4 asfurthering the regulatory framework which underlies the enactment of section14.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\167\ <T3>See </T3>S. Rep. No. 379, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1963).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\168\ The Special Study of the Securities Markets of the Securitiesand Exchange Commission (``Special Study'') found that securities tradedOTC were more heterogeneous than those traded on the exchanges and stronglyurged further study of those markets. H. Doc. No. 95. Pt. 2, 88th Cong.,1st Sess. Chapter VIII at 814, Chapter XII at 568 (1963). It is, therefore,just as plausible to conclude that Congressional uncertainty over the functioningof these markets caused legislative silence on voting rights, instead ofa purported Congressional determination that voting rights were unimportantfor the purposes of section 14.This conclusion is still valid despite the enactment of the 1975 Amendmentsat a time when the Amex had a policy permitting disparate voting rightsstock. Unlike the Act, which was meant to create a new system ``for theregulation of securities exchanges and of over-the-counter markets, (and)to prevent inequitable and unfair practices on such exchanges and markets,''\169\<NOTE/> the 1975 Amendments were intended primarily to address tradingmarket problems that had developed in the 1960s and 1970s.\170\<NOTE/> Without more concrete evidence in the legislative history,and in light of the continued absence of any dramatic expansion of thenumber of issuers with disparate voting stock by 1975, it is not credibleto imply from Congressional silence the approval of the disparate votingpolicy of the Amex. Again, in contrast, the legislative history of theoriginal enactment of the Act provides ample evidence of Congressionalinterest in corporate suffrage issues.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\169\ Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 9323, 78th Cong.,2d Sess., 35 (1934).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\170\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>H.R. Rep.

Accordingly, it is appropriate for the Commission to amend exchangerules to address disenfranchising transactions, as such transactions makehollow the substantive proxy protections contained in Section 14 and frustratethe reasonable expectations of investors as to their voting rights.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\171\ 15 U.S.C. 78f(6)(5), 78<T3>o</T3>-3(b)(6).Rule 19c-4 has been drafted carefully to identify only those situationsin which shareholders would be disenfranchised.\172\<NOTE/> As discussed above, the Rule protects investors from disparatevoting rights plans that result in disenfranchisement, thereby eliminatinga shareholder's right to have any effect on future corporate decisionsthrough transactions that are not fully subject to market discipline. Atthe same time, however, the Rule is crafted to permit disparate votingrights plans that do not disenfranchise existing shareholders and assurethat the creation of shares with lesser voting rights is subject to marketdiscipline.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\172\ We note that the SROs will be able to exclude from theRule's coverage any non-disenfranchising transactions. Accordingly, theRule's focus is related directly to the protection of investors and thepublic interest.Finally, the Commission notes that the 1975 Amendments added Section 11Ato the Act to ``facilitate the establishment of a national market systemfor securities.'' \173\<NOTE/> Section 11A of the Act directs the Commission to ``use itsauthority * * * to carry out the objectives (of Section 11A and) by rule* * * designate the securities or classes of securities qualified for tradingin the national market system.'' \174\<NOTE/> Section 11A(a)(1) enumerates several statutory objectivesincluding the maintenance of ``fair competition among brokers and dealers,among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and [other] markets* * *.'' \175\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\173\ <T3>See </T3>S.

In discussing the concept of equal regulation, Congressstated that if the Commission decides that ``any disparity in regulation* * * permits an unfair competitive advantage,'' it is authorized to modifysuch regulation.\179\<NOTE/> This passage clearly refers to unequal SRO regulation, becausethe Commission already had general authority to modify its own regulationsin this manner.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\176\ House Report No. 229, <T3>supra </T3>note 170, at 93-99.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\177\ S.

The Commission believesthat a minimum standard regarding disparate voting rights plans for allmarkets furthers the equal regulation and fair competition requirementsembodied in section 11A. Over the past several years, issuer recapitalizationshave resulted in SROs attempting to compete for listings by lowering listingstandards concerning shareholder voting rights. It is clear that despitesubstantial efforts, the SROs are incapable of agreeing on minimum protectionsfor shareholder voting rights for their listed or NASDAQ eligible companies.The Commission believes a minimum rule would further the section 11A objectiveof fair competition among SROs.\180\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\180\The Commission also disagrees with the ABA argument thatthe Commission can only consider a rule's impact on markets and the competitionamong markets for listing securities in reviewing proposed rule changesof the SROs under section 19(b), and may only commence 19(c) proceedingsto amend the rules of other SROs if the rule would result in unequal regulationand unfair competition. It appears anomalous to claim that the Commissioncan use its section 19(b) authority to prevent shareholder disenfranchisementif an SRO submits a rule that would result in unfair competition and unequalregulation, but that it does not have the same section 19(c) authorityto protect directly investors and the public interest. The Commission alsodisagrees with the Business Roundtable argument that Congress' ``delegation''of authority under section 19(c) to regulate matters of corporate governancewould be unconstitutional under the ``nondelegation'' doctrine. Rule 19c-4is not intended to regulate corporate governance, but to protect the votingrights of shareholders. This is consistent with the Commission's mandate,going back to its creation in 1934, to protect investors in the nation'ssecurities markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion</ITAG>In consideration of the above, the Commission has decided to adopt Rule19c-4. The Commission's public proceedings in connection with its considerationof proposed Rule 19c-4 have been extensive. As noted above, the Commissionhas received and reviewed over 1,100 comment letters in response to proposedRule 19c-4. In addition, the Commission has held two public hearings onthe voting rights issue, one directly related to Rule 19c-4 and the otherrelated to the NYSE's proposal to amend its one share, one vote standard.After careful review of the record, the Commission believes Rule 19c-4is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the Act, and specificallysections 6, 11A, 14, 15A and 19 of the Act. These sections, among otherthings, embody the principles of fair corporate suffrage, equal regulation,fair competition, and the protection of investors and the public interest.When the shareholder voting rights issue began to attract attention in1984, the overwhelming majority of issuers listed on the NYSE and Amexor quoted over NASDAQ did not have a disparate voting rights structure.\181\<NOTE/> Most of those that did were growth companies with substantialfamily or insider holdings. In the year prior to the Proposing Releasean increasing number of companies recapitalized to a dual class structure.These companies, which disenfranchised shareholders to convert to a dualstructure, often were more established companies with extensive publicownership.\182\<NOTE/> If Rule 19c-4 is not adopted, additional companies will disenfranchiseshareholders in order to restructure themselves for defensive purposes.Such disenfranchisement of the shareholders of American companies wouldinjure public investors and diminish investor confidence in the U.S. securitiesmarkets. Rule 19c-4 will ensure that the U.S. securities markets are notso harmed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\181\<T3>See</T3> Seligman, <T3>Equal Protection in Shareholder Voting Rights: The One Share, One VoteControversy,</T3> 54 G.W. L. Rev. at 703-07. In his article, ProfessorSeligman stressed that the number of corporations contemplating dual classstructures had been insignificant prior to 1984 and 1985. Professor Seligmannoted that through 1976, there were 37 corporations listed on the Amexwith multiple classes of stock. By 1985, this number had increased to approximately60, or 7% of the 785 companies listed on the Amex. In addition, there wereapproximately 10 firms listed on the NYSE, and 110 of the 4,101 companiestraded on NASDAQ, (2.7%), which had two classes of stock in 1985. Accordingly,Professor Seligman noted that there were relatively few corporations (170of the 4,886 corporations traded on the Amex and NASDAQ) with disproportionatevoting rights structures listed on the exchanges or traded on NASDAQ priorto and during 1985. In contrast, the Commission notes that, as of June1, 1988, 55 companies listed on the NYSE, 117 companies listed on the Amex,and 182 companies traded on NASDAQ have dual class voting structures.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\182\<T3>See, e.g.,</T3> OCE Update, which found more NYSE companies recapitalizingwith less insider holders after the NYSE imposed its moratorium on itsone share, one vote rule.Rule 19c-4 prohibits the listing on a national securities exchange or theauthorization by a national securities association of equity securitiesissued by companies that issue securities or take corporate action withthe effect of nullifying, restricting, or disparately reducing the votingrights of existing shareholders. At the same time, Rule 19c-4 permits thelisting and trading of securities that adopt disparate voting rights plansthat do not have such a disenfranchising effort on the voting rights ofexisting shareholders. This avoids unduly burdening issuers and allowsfor flexibility in devising a corporation's capital structure.The Commission believes that the Rule provides an appropriate balance betweenthe concerns of those commentators that feared Rule 19c-4 would infringeon corporate capital structures and governance, and those commentatorsthat support a rule that would prohibit corporations from adopting disparatevoting rights plans that diminish or eliminate the voting rights of existingshareholders.Further, the Commission is convinced it has authority to adopt Rule 19c-4.Concerns by issuers that the Rule would infringe unduly on state law becauseit could be interpreted to affect state anti-takeover statutes and defensivetactics such as poison pills are ill-founded. As discussed above, the Commissionhas made clear that Rule 19c-4 is not, as a general matter, designed toaddress specific tender offer defensive tactics that may be adopted byissuers but instead is intended to prevent disenfranchising corporate actions.Moreover, the Rule would exempt corporate action taken pursuant to mandatorystate control share acquisition statutes. Adoption of Rule 19c-4 clearlyfalls within the Commission's mandate to protect investors and the publicinterest and ensure fair corporate suffrage.Finally, we note that in this Release, the Commission has attempted todescribe the Rule's coverage and address the interpretive issues raisedby commentators. We believe that the Rule's standard of preventing issuancesor actions that nullify, restrict or disparately reduce voting rights ofexisting shareholders, in addition to the list of transactions presumedto be permitted or prohibited, should provide sufficient guidance to issuers.To the extent new structures develop that raise questions on the Rule'sapplicability, we believe the SROs, with Commission oversight, should beable to determine whether a given transaction is disenfranchising.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.

While understandable, these concerns are easily overstated.The Act reflects a particular Congressional solicitude toward the exerciseof voting rights and subjects few, if any, other incidents of share ownershipto the degree of regulation and oversight directed at corporate suffrage.The reasoning supporting Rule 19c-4 would therefore not necessarily supportfuture Commission rulemakings imposing uniform listing standards regulatingother aspects of corporate governance. Put another way, Section 19(c) doesnot provide the Commission <T3>carte blanche </T3>to adopt federal corporate governance standardsthrough the back door by mandating uniform listing standards. The disenfranchisementproblem addressed by Rule 19c-4 presents a narrow and special case thatdoes not easily extend to other corporate governance standards that maybe referenced by listing critera.Rule 19c-4 also does not prohibit any corporation from adopting any capitalstructure. Corporations can continue to issue any number of classes ofstock, some with little or no voting power and others with substantialor even dominant control.\4\<NOTE/> The rule is, instead, carefully crafted to address concernsabout the process by which disenfranchisement occurs. The transactionsthat most consistently cause concern involve exchange offers, dividends,or other distributions that dramatically increase the voting power of arelatively small, well defined group of stockholders at the expense ofa larger group of public stockholders.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ For example, suppose a corporation with a twenty percentshareholder seeks to concentrate voting powers in that shareholder. Itcan achieve that result by offering to repurchase the eighty percent ofits outstanding voting shares held by the public and raising the necessarycapital through the issuance of nonvoting shares. If control in the handsof the twenty percent shareholder truly enhances the corporation's value,this transaction will be financially feasible. If, however, the primaryeffect of the transaction is to transfer wealth from public shareholdersto the dominant shareholder, then the transaction may be more difficultto finance. Further, if a corporation wants to raise additional equitycapital without diluting the voting control of existing shareholders, Rule19c-4 allows the issuance and sale of nonvoting shares. The market mechanism,which is a substitute for the electoral mechanism generally relied uponin transactions that raise disenfranchisement concerns, thus acts as afilter allowing beneficial recapitalizations and financings to continuewhile deterring transactions that tend primarily to disenfranchise andtransfer wealth from public to inside shareholders without competitivecompensation. <T3>See, </T3>R. Gilson, <T3>Evaluating Dual Class Common Stock: The Relevance of Substitute, </T3>73Va. L. Rev. 807 (1987).The Supreme Court has recently relied on the potential for collective actionproblems as a basis for unholding Indiana's control share acquisition statute.\5\<NOTE/> As the Court noted, collective action problems can causeshareholders to vote in favor of propositions that they might oppose ifgiven an opportunity to act together as a group.\6\<NOTE/> Such collective action problems are hardly unique to shareholders_theyappear in many voting contexts and have long been subject to careful analysis.\7\<NOTE/> Here, the evidence of record suggests that collective actionproblems are associated with the process governing corporate disenfranchisementdecisions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>CTS Corp. v.

Ruback, <T3>Coercive Dual Class Recapitalization, </T3>(MIT, Sloan School of Management,Working Paper) (Dec. 1986).While every electoral process is potentially subject to a collective actionproblem, there are sound reasons for the Commission to focus its concernon decisions that can lead to disenfranchisement. All voting choices fallinto one of two categories: they are either ``constitutional'' or ``parliamentary.''\11\<NOTE/> A constitutional choice involves a decision about how otherdecisions will be made. A parliamentary choice involves the applicationto a particular problem of a decision rule previously determined by a constitutionalchoice. An election that proposes to disenfranchise certain shareholdersis a constitutional choice because it permanently alters the process bywhich later corporate decisions are made.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>C. Mueller, <T3>Social Choice </T3>(1979); J. M. Buchanan andamp; G. Tullock, <T3>The Calculus of Consent </T3>(1962); J. A. Rawls, <T3>A Theory of Justice </T3>(1971).Constitutional choices are legitimately subject to greater scrutiny thanparliamentary choices and are rationally subject to more stringent safeguards.\12\<NOTE/> These safeguards can include supermajority requirements orabsolute prohibitions on disenfranchisements.\13\<NOTE/> They can also include requirements such as Rule 19c-4 thatchannel constitutional decisions through mechanisms less susceptible tocollective choice problems. Indeed, the greater scrutiny rationally accordedto constitutional choices provides a sound and consistent rationale forthe Commission's decision at least initially to focus its attention onthe disenfranchisement process.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Mueller, <T3>supra </T3>note 11; Rawls, <T3>supra </T3>note 11.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ <T3>Compare, e.q., </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23724 (Oct.17, 1986), 51 FR 37529 (proposed rule change filed with the Commissionby the New York Stock Exchange that would establich a supermajority requirementfor disenfranchising transactions) <T3>with </T3> NYSE, <T3>New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual </T3>section 313.00(c)(Unusual Voting Provisions), 313.00(D) (Proportionate Voting Power) (1933andamp; Supp. 1986).Finally, it is worthwhile to observe that Rule 19c-4 may, in the future,be criticized for generating alleged inconsistencies in its applicationand result. Some of these inconsistencies may be real while others willonly be apparent. Some inconsistencies may be due to the Commission's effortto craft a rule that has a primarily prospective effect and that thereforeprovides some latitude for ``grandfathered'' transactions that might otherwisehave been prohibited.\14\<NOTE/> Moreover, some inconsistencies may be due to interpretationsof Rule 19c-4 as applied by the self regulatory organizations. Here, Ijoin in Commissioner Fleischman's exhortation to the SROs that they displaymeaningful backbone and apply Rule 19c-4 consistently according to itsterms and intent.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>discussion in adopting release of shareholder rightsplans at Section III. B.5.b. and note that flip-in poison pill plans havebeen found to be discriminatory. <T3>See, e.g., Amalgamated Sugar Co. v. NL Industries, Inc., </T3>644 F.Supp. 1229 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (applying New Jersey law); <T3>R.D. Smith andamp; Co. v. Preway Inc., </T3>644 F. Supp. 868 (W.D.

Oct. 31, 1986) (applying Colorado law).More fundamentally, however, it should be recognized that Rule 19c-4 dealswith one of the more intricate and difficult areas in all the social sciences:the problems of social choice. The entire field is rife with paradoxes,contradictions, and impossibility theorems.\15\<NOTE/> Indeed, when subject to close scrutiny, even the simple majorityvoting procedure that we often take for granted as a fair and generallyaccepted method of social decisionmaking is revealed to be full of potentialcontradictions that can make it appear arbitrary and capricious.\16\<NOTE/> Accordingly, it is neither reasonable nor possible to holdRule 19c-4 to a standard that requires perfect logical consistency in allcircumstances and all applications. No voting rule or rule regulating votingbehavior can achieve that result, and Rule 19c-4 should not be held tosuch an unattainable standard. The rule should, instead, be understoodfor what it is: an effort to craft a carefully targeted standard that operatesprospectively to substitute market mechanisms for voting processes in situationsthat involve a substantial danger of collective action problems and thatraise disenfranchisement concerns of constitutional magnitude.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ The most famous of these is Arrow's impossibility theoremwhich demonstrates, among other things, that no voting rule satisfies aset of four seemingly innocuous and desirable conditions. <T3>See </T3>K.

That will happen because the Commission's actions today not only expandthe Code of Federal Regulations but also ``add to'' \2\<NOTE/> the codex of rules of each affected national securities exchangeand of the NASD. In my view, so it should be.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ NYSE, <T3>New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual</T3> sections 313.00(C)(Unusual Voting Provisions), 313.00(D) (Proportionate Voting Power) (1983andamp; Supp. 1986) [hereinafter <T3>Company Manual</T3>].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(c): ``The Commission, by rule, may abrogate,add to, and delete from * * * the rules of a self-regulatory organization* * *.''For most of this century, exchange (and, more recently, NASD) listing standardshave interacted with the mandatory and permissive provisions of the corporatelaws of the several states, subject to Commission rules of specific application,to provide an accepted framework for the safeguarding of public shareholderrights and the inhibition of corporate managers' overreaching.\3\<NOTE/> For example, the corporate decision to grant stock optionsto employees was shaped by corporate law requirements such as Section 505of the New York Business Corporation Law,\4\<NOTE/> listing standards such as section 312 of the <T3>Company Manual,</T3>\5\<NOTE/> and Commission rules such as Item 10 of Schedule 14A \6\<NOTE/> and paragraph (a) of Rule 16b-3 \7\<NOTE/> (plus, of course, the ever-changing provisions of the InternalRevenue Code). Over the years no small part in the process was played byexchange staff members who (returning to my example above) quietly insistedthat, while it was nowhere in the canon to be found, an exchange ``interpretation''would mandate the undertaking by the listed company not to replace out-of-the-moneyinstruments with new at-the-market options in the absence of further shareholderaction. As a result of that interaction, there was achieved a merger ofsubstantive protections and procedural requirements, illuminated by Commission-mandateddisclosure, that did somehow raise the level of generally accepted corporatepractice among American public business enterprises.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ I am indebted to Professor Louis Lowenstein of the ColumbiaLaw School for re-focusing my attention on this near-uninventable tripartitestructure.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ N.Y.

A brief reviewof the rule added to each of their manuals demonstrates why this is so.Pursuant to Rule 19c-4, a rule of each affected exchange and of the NASDwill forbid that exchange or the NASD from listing, or continuing to list,\8\<NOTE/> equity securities of a domestic company if the company takescorporate action <T3>``with the effect</T3> of nullifying, restricting or disparately reducingthe per share voting rights of holders of an outstanding (publicly-held)class or classes of common stock''.\9\<NOTE/> Recognizing that application, <T3>i.e.,</T3> interpretation, of its own rule will as always fall in thefirst instance to the exchanges and the NASD, paragraph (f) of Rule 19c-4admonishes those organizations to adhere to interpretive policies ``consistentwith'' and ``otherwise in furtherance of'' \1\\0\<NOTE/> the broad purposes of the Exchange Act to which Rule 19c-4is directed. In addition, in order that the exchanges and the NASD mayharbor no illusions about its views on key issues raised during the commentprocess, the Commission has listed in Rule 19c-4 four types of corporateaction that will be ``presumed to have the (prohibited) effect'' and fourtypes of corporate action that, <T3>``standing alone''</T3>, will be ``presumed <T3>not</T3> to have the (prohibited) effect'',\1\\1\<NOTE/> and has discussed in the Release each of these eight mattersas well as a series of other substantive issues.\1\\2\<NOTE/> The lengthy discussion of such matters serves to alert companyofficials and their counsel, as well as the stock list staffs, not onlyto the applications and exclusions specifically covered but also to theapproaches the Commission expects to be taken to interpretation and applicationquestions generally.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ In the case of the NASD, the correct term is ``authoriz[ing]for quotation and transaction reporting through an automated quotationsystem''.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Rule 19c-4(a), (b) (emphasis added).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Rule 19c-4(f).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Rule 19c-4(c), (d) (emphasis added).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ <T3>See </T3>Exchange Act Release No. 25,891, at 37-69 (July 7, 1988).Since Rule 19c-4 prescribes an ``effects'' test, it is clear to me thatthe corporate action to be scrutinized by the stock list staffs will, inmany instances, include any action taken by the listed or applicant companyas a second or subsequent step reasonably soon after an action that benefitedfrom the presumption of permissibility. Since Rule 19c-4 describes bothimpermissible and permissible corporate actions in terms of a presumption,actions that on their face appear to fall in one category or the othermay nevertheless qualify, or fail to qualify, the company for listing orcontinuance in the list. I believe the key admonitions are the following:(1) The focus should be on the process by which the voting rights structurein issue is created (not on the company's capital structure<T3> per se</T3>) and its effect on existing holders of publicly-held stock.\13\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 34, 43.(2) Corporate action that, standing alone, is presumed to be permissibledoes not exempt a scheme that involves such action in conjunction withother action if, when taken as a whole, the combined action has the effectof disenfranchising existing public shareholders.\14\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 38.(3) It is the Commission's intent to minimize the impact of Rule 19c-4on state regulation of corporate structures and to defer to state law whenstates have chosen specifically to regulate or limit corporate action.\15\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 35 n.84 (last two sentences), 58.(4) Analytical and interpretive issues are best left to the stock liststaffs of the exchanges and the NASD to determine, in light of the Commission'sstatements in the Release, when applying the rule.\16\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>E.g., id.</T3> at 39 n.31, 40, 60, 66.Fundamental to the implementation of Rule 19c-4 in my view, however, isreliance on the respective stock list staffs of the exchanges and the NASDto abandon the vestiges of past practice in interpreting and applying listedcompany rules without notice of the substance of their actions to the Commissionor to the listed companies and their counsel generally. Policies, practicesand interpretations of the exchanges and the NASD are ``rules'' of thoseorganizations by virtue of Rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act \17\<NOTE/> and must be treated as such under Section 19(b). Of course,not every stock list staff application of any rule qualifies as a ``policy'',but multiple application begins to resemble a ``practice'' and generalapplication certainly rises to an ``interpretation''. If it is true that``historically the Commission has permitted the exchanges to interpret,and develop practices to implement, their listing standards in order todeal with the huge variety of circumstances to which they must be applied,without following the procedures required by section 19(b)'',\18\<NOTE/> it seems to me that modification of that practice is requiredto assure greater public understanding of exchange and NASD proceedingsin the implementation of Rule 19c-4.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ Letter from Robert Todd Lang, Chairman, Task Force onDisparate Voting Rights, Section of Corporation, Banking and Business Law,American Bar Association, to Jonathan G.

That is as it should be.It is the responsibility and care that the implementation of this ruleshould elicit from the stock list staffs_precisely the sort of responsibilityand care that they have traditionally brought to the performance of theirprofessional function.
