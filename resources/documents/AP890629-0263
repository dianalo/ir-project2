ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Paramount Communications Inc. announced todaythat seven banks have agreed to serve as co-agents in the syndicatebeing formed to finance the company's $12.2 billion tender offer forTime Inc.   The syndicate of banks will provide 90 percent of the financingfor the $200-a-share unsolicited offer. Paramount has said thesyndicate would provide $14 billion of the $15.6 billion estimatedfinancing costs, while the remaining $1.6 billion is to raisedthrough the sale of debt securities.   The lack of financing commitments for Paramount's bid is one ofthe objections raised by Time to the unwanted offer. Today'sannouncement does not mean Paramount has obtained the commitments,but it is a step toward satisfying that condition.   Time is trying to preserve a merger with Warner CommunicationsInc. and fight the Paramount bid.   Time stock _ which has fluctuated as traders tried to forecastthe outcome of the three-way struggle _ was up $1.62{ a share to$158.87{ in early New York Stock Exchange trading, indicating WallStreet feels somewhat more optimistic today about the Paramount bid.   Warner stock was off 62{ cents to $60.12{ a share, whileParamount slipped $$1.12{ to $61.75 a share.   On Wednesday, Delaware Chancery Court Judge William T. Allen saidTime's shareholder meeting can proceed as scheduled Friday.   Allen, ruling in a suit brought by several major Timeshareholders, declined to issue a restraining order postponing themeeting scheduled in New York.   The meeting originally was called for June 23 for shareholders tovote on Time's planned stock-swap merger with Warner and on theelection of four Time board members.   After Paramount announced its original $10.7 billion takeover bidfor Time June 6, the meeting was rescheduled and Time officialswithdrew the merger proposal from the agenda.   Time and Warner have since restructured their merger agreement,under which Time is making a $14 billion tender offer for Warner.   Several major Time shareholders, including Texas investor RobertBass, have complained that information Time has given them aboutFriday's meeting was incomplete and inadequately reflectedtakeover-related events that had occurred since proxy materials weresent to shareholders. Those events include Paramount's tender offerand Time's rejection of it.   Four incumbent members of the Time board _ including Chairman andChief Executive Richard Munro and President Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr._ are running unopposed for re-election at Friday's meeting.   Allen said there might be some merit to arguments raised byshareholders but that he would rather spend his time preparing forthe July 11 hearing in a suit brought by Paramount against Time thanto take two days to determine the legal merits of the shareholdercomplaint.   Allen said no irreparable harm would result from allowing themeeting and the likely re-election of the board members to proceed,as the four would continue serving on the board anyway until a newmeeting was called.   Before the meeting could be restrained or prohibited, theshareholders had to prove irreparable harm would result fromallowing that action to occur.   Observers believe the July 11 hearing could be pivotal in thebattle for Time. The hearing is expected to deal with Paramount'scontention that Time effectively put itself up for takeover bids byannouncing in March it would merge with Warner.   Under state law in Delaware _ where all three companies areincorporated _ if a company has put itself up for sale its board isrequired to seek the maximum value for shareholders.   If Allen rules Time put itself up for sale, the company's boardcould be hard-pressed to reject Paramount's $200-a-share cash bid,which is $74 higher than the price at which Time stock traded beforeParamount announced its bid.   Time has rejected Paramount's offer, calling it financiallyinadequate and subject to too many conditions.   Time has said shareholders won't be asked to vote on any issuesrelated to the Time-Warner merger at Friday's meeting, but it islikely some angry stockholders _ who believe Time should accept theParamount bid _ will vehemently express their displeasure with theboard.   ``It's going to be a circus,'' Jerome E. Hass, a professor atCornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management, saidWednesday of the meeting. ``People are going to fight for themicrophone and chastise management.''</TEXT></DOC>
