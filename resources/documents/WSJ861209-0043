The affiliation for the first time grants the options-only exchange the ability to trade stocks. CBOE officials insist that the 13-year-old exchange needs to trade stocks, and possibly futures contracts, to remain competitive in the rapidly evolving securities industry.    The exchange's 2,057 members began voting on the proposal yesterday, but the required quorum of 850 votes wasn't reached, so voting was extended to today, a CBOE spokeswoman said.    Falling short of a quorum is an indication that the membership considers the affiliation a foregone conclusion and tacitly approves the move, maintained Gary Lahey, CBOE vice chairman and its highest ranking elected administrator. He said that technically the affiliation could occur without membership approval but that the administration wanted a show of support for the $1.7 million plan.    &quot;Why not affiliate, especially in the competitive environment we're in? We need that capability for the future,&quot; said John Power, a CBOE floor member and trader.    As part of the affiliation, the CBOE will pay nearly $1.2 million to buy 171 Cincinnati exchange seats, and will make a $500,000 capital infusion to help modernize the Cincinnati exchange's trading systems, CBOE officials said.    Most immediately, the CBOE, which dominates the options industry, needs the ability to trade stocks in case the Securities and Exchange Commission proceeds with a pilot program to allow side-by-side trading of stocks and options on those stocks on the same exchange floor.    SEC staff members periodically vent their frustration with the current system of allocating options among exchanges. With the advent of options on over-the-counter stocks and competitive trading in these issues, exchanges fear that regulators will promote side-by-side trading for all options as part of the expansion of OTC options trading.    So far the SEC hasn't ranked side-by-side trading as an immediate concern, exchange officials say.    Earlier this year CBOE officials announced plans to register as a futures exchange, to enable it to compete with other securities exchanges, most of which already have futures trading subsidiaries. </TEXT></DOC>
