Thefollowing is a brief summarization of the significant changes.  In andSection; 274.1 some additional terms are defined to clarify the meaningof the pertinent terms utilized throughout Part 274 which have caused orcould cause misinterpretations. Most of the definitions have been clarifiedas a result of the experience gained from applying the regulations duringthe past five years.  Section 274.2 has been revised to provide authorization for any immigrationofficer to carry out the provisions of section 274(b) of the Immigrationand Nationality Act (Act).  Section 274.5 has been revised to be consistent with section 274(b) bydeleting the provision that the conveyance of an ``innocent owner'' isnot subject to forfeiture. Concurrently, previous andSection; 274.14, nowandSection; 274.15, regarding remission of forfeiture has been amended topermit owners to petition for remission of forfeiture. Additionally, andSection;274.5 has been revised to facilitate expeditious return of conveyancesnot subject to forfeiture or for which pursuing forfeiture is not in thebest interest of justice without adversely impacting upon the enforcementof section 274(b) of the Act. Similarly, in regard to seeking relief fromforfeiture a petition under the revised regulations (andSection;andSection;274.13-274.17) can be considered for either remission or mitigation offorfeiture. Section 274.7 and paragraph 274.1(a) have been revised to establish moreuniformity within the Department of Justice regarding the appraisal ofseized property. Sections 274.8 and 274.9 have been revised to provide for more informationto the owner and any known lienholders of a seized conveyance about theseizure and procedures for processing a seized conveyance. The revisions,also, provide for more information in the published advertisement of theseizure.  Sections 274.10 and 274.12 have been revised to clarify the proceduresfor filing a claim and a bond to obtain commencement of judicial forfeitureproceedings for a seized conveyance.  Sections 274.14-274.17 have been reorganized and renumbered to provideprocedural information on filing of petitions for relief from forfeiturein two sequential sections. These sections have, also, been revised tofacilitate the processing of such petitions without adversely impactingupon enforcement.  Section 274.18 has been expanded to provide further specific guidance onremission of forfeiture in straw purchaser, leasehold, community property,and subrogee situations.  Section 274.19 has been expanded significantly to provide guidance on thehandling of and the issuance of determinations on petitions for relieffrom forfeiture and to provide a procedure for reconsideration of a determinationdenying relief from forfeiture.  Section 274.21 has been deleted.  This final rule is not a rule within the meaning of either Executive Order12291, Section 1(a), or the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3> This rule is interpretative and states agency policy,practice, and procedure for which notice of proposed rule making is notrequired under 5 U.S.C. 553(b).
