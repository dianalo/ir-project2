Colvin, NASA inspector general.andM;Under the proposed standard, each agency would categorize its data under oneof three security levels.andP;  The first level would include data that could beshared such as personnel files, proprietary data and procurement information.andO;Mandatory protections for level one would be password controls, logging andaudit trails.andM;Level two would cover information whose inadvertent release or modificationwould compromise agency effectiveness and would require access controls.andO;Examples would be economic analyses, investigative data and financialinformation.andM;Level three would include information that significantly affects agencymissions such as security clearance files and payment authorizations.andP;  Thisdata would warrant encryption.andM;&quot;It's a kind of quasi-standard so that everyone understands the rules incertain categories, but you are not told by someone else where to place it,&quot;Mancher said.andP;  &quot;There's a role for the Office of Management and Budget andthe Office of Personnel Management to issue a consistent group of penaltiesand obligations just like disclosure rules so agencies don't take itlightly.&quot;andM;Some board members argued that it would be extremely difficult to reach aconsensus on the definitions and agencies are not likely to accept imposedrequirements.andP;  However, Cooper said most agencies already use such a schemeand the government needs to establish a uniform method for protecting itsdata.andM;In a related matter, officials from the General Services Administration, theFederal Aviation Administration and the Veterans Affairs Department briefedboard members on security plans for their respective Presidential PrioritySystems.andP;  GSA's FTS 2000 system, FAA's Advanced Automation System and theVA's Decentralized Hospital Computer Program, are in various stages ofimplementation, but officials said they would meet C2 level requirements.andM;However, several board members said the agencies did not appear to haveadequate access controls and procedures for holding users responsible fortheir actions.andM;Willis H. Ware, a member of the Rand Corp.'s research staff and boardchairman, said despite the obvious differences in agency systemsrequirements, agencies should be able to work together to develop technicalspecifications for acquiring simple security devices.andP;  He said basic securitytools such as bar-coded cards could improve user access controls at minimumcost.andM;&quot;Force the development of devices to identify users,&quot; Ware said.andP;  &quot;The FAAcould take the lead, and it could be done cheaply, but [agencies] have to gettogether.andP;  There should be a mechanism for agencies to agree on commondevices.&quot;andM;Steve Smith, security program manager for the Advanced Automation System,said the FAA's biggest problem has been convincing air traffic controllersthat more security measures would not compromise their ability to access thesystem.andP;  He said it has been a struggle to educate users on how securityprocedures can improve safety without interfering with mission capability.andM;&quot;Controllers need immediate availability to the system to do the job, butuser groups said a user ID and password would deny their ability to do thejob, and they questioned the safety,&quot; Smith said.andP;  &quot;It didn't last long, butwhat was needed was education, and the act helped.&quot;andM;Smith said FAA defined its major security concerns as data reliability anddenial of service.andP;  The strongest threats are likely to come from disgruntledemployees, knowledgeable outsiders and saboteurs.andM;Gerald Lang, director of VA's System Users Management Service, said hisagency has concentrated on raising awareness.andP;  He said doctors and otherhospital and medical staff need more training to become alert to ADP securityrisks.andP;  He said VA has stiff penalties for employees found guilty oftampering with medical and financial records.andM;Michael Corrigan, deputy commissioner of GSA's Information ResourcesManagement Service for telecommunications, said officials are reviewingvendor security plans for FTS 2000.andP;  He said GSA still is defining somerequirements but the network will be able to transmit traffic encrypted byagencies on an &quot;end-user-to-end-user basis.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
