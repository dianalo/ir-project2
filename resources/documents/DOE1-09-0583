Yet,nuclear facilities are obligated to determine the effectiveness of theirsafeguards systems against the Insider Threat and are sometimes requiredby various government agencies to estimate site risk measures for thisthreat. This paper presents a methodology for quantifying a topic thatresists quantification. Three distinct steps are involved in the methodologyfor assessing the Insider Threat potential: 1. Characterize the typesof insiders who might potentially harm the organization, with emphasison scientific and engineering facilities; 2. Identify and assess elementsin the organization's Personnel Reliability Program that can reduce thechances of the Insider Threat potential being realized; and 3. Applyan event tree methodology that uses the above surrogate data to evaluatethe site-specific Insider threat potential. In addition to presentinga methodology for quantifying the Insider Threat potential, the paperalso gives some basic conclusions on preventing insider malevolence thatare drawn from analyses of insider cases and expert opinion.</TEXT></DOC>
