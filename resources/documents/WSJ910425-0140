What's your bank balance? Howmuch do you owe?   People who wouldn't dream of revealing that kind ofinformation to their best friends routinely spill theirfinancial guts when they apply for loans, ask for creditcards, buy insurance and open accounts at banks and brokeragefirms. In some cases, they even turn over tax returns, paystubs and brokerage statements without giving it a secondthought.</LP><TEXT>   And once financial institutions have the information, theytend to use it -- even if the person doesn't get the loan oropen the account. Not only do the institutions use theinformation as a source of marketing leads and share it withcredit bureaus, they frequently sell it to others. &quot;When youfill out an application, chances are it will be sold,&quot; saysEvan Hendricks, editor of the Privacy Times, a Washington,D.C., newsletter. Thrifts, for example, sell lists of largedepositors, he notes.   But people who are concerned about their privacy may beable to limit how much of their financial information ends upin public hands. It sometimes isn't necessary to answer everyquestion, privacy experts and industry executives say. And itmay be possible to get the institution to agree not torelease the information you do supply.   The first step is to get a sense of why the information iswanted. &quot;There's nothing wrong with asking what theinformation is for,&quot; says Michael Maher, a compliance officerwith First Bank Systems in Minneapolis.   If required by law, the applicant must supply theinformation. Questions required by law include SocialSecurity numbers for accounts that pay interest or dividends,and sex, race or national origin on applications formortgages and home-equity loans. (Applicants are allowed torefuse to answer race and gender questions, but loan officersare obliged to note the information anyway.)   Most questions, however, aren't required by law. Instead,they're asked to establish credit-worthiness, to preventfraud and to conform to general security industry guidelines.   Some of the information is also just to help the company'smarketing effort. &quot;If you apply for auto insurance, they'llask if you have homeowner's or life insurance, so they canapproach you later with sales pitches for those products,&quot;says Robert Hunter, a director of the National InsuranceConsumers Organization.   Though financial institutions can ask for virtually anydetail they want, there are often opportunities to challengequestions you find intrusive.   In some cases, applicants may conclude that even seeminglyirrelevant information is needed. New York's giant Citibank,for example, asks account applicants to supply their employeeI.D. numbers. The reason: It has found that in New York manyapplicants have the same name and work for the same largeemployer.   Still, says a Citibank spokeswoman, the information is&quot;requested, not required.&quot;   Some people who receive pre-approved applications fromcredit-card issuers figure the issuer already knows enoughabout their credit-worthiness to have sent them apre-approved application. So they don't answer most of thequestions. Card issuers say they need fresh details becauseinformation from credit bureaus may be out of date orincorrect. But people who have refused to provide additionalinformation say they sometimes get cards anyway.   Brokerage firms and mutual fund companies typically askdetailed questions about an applicant's assets, on the groundthat the National Association of Securities Dealers' Rules ofFair Practice encourage them to find out as much aboutcustomers as possible in order to provide prudent investingadvice. But if the institution isn't providing financialadvice, industry guidelines say it doesn't have to ask fordetails of applicants' assets.   &quot;It's quite common for customers who are offended bysomething not to fill it in,&quot; says Robert Colby, chiefcounsel in the division of markets regulations at theSecurities and Exchange Commission. In these cases, it's upto the company to decide whether it will accept theapplication.   Some applicants take a different approach. A New Yorkwoman who recently opened a $2,000 individual retirementaccount at a major brokerage firm says she was offended byquestions about things like her net worth, marital status,occupation and whether she owned or rented her home. Afraidthat the account wouldn't be opened if she didn't answer, shesays, &quot;l lied about a lot of it.&quot;   Other people simply swallow their privacy concerns out offear of being rejected, especially when it comes to mortgageor home-equity loan applications. &quot;You want to fight them?You won't get the loan. Most of the time you're not in aposition to negotiate,&quot; says Robert Gellman, chief counsel tothe House subcommittee on government information.   But industry executives and privacy experts say applicantsshouldn't lie and shouldn't feel cowed into submission.Instead, they say, people should share their concerns withthe person handling the application for the financialinstitution. Those who aren't satisfied that all thequestions are necessary should explain their desire toprotect their privacy.   This should help allay any suspicion that the applicant isa paranoid crank or a drug dealer trying to concealill-gotten gains. For reasonable objections, &quot;I don't thinkthey'd turn down a business opportunity,&quot; says Mr. Maher ofFirst Bank Systems.   Whether they provide all the information or not,applicants can cross out lines on release statements, whichsay the institution can exchange the information, says EllenStockdale, a spokeswoman for the Controller of Currency. &quot;Butthey don't have to accept your application if you refuse,&quot;she adds.   Anne Slattery, managing director of Citibank's New Yorkbranch network, says, however, that if applicants do thistheir applications will still be accepted. &quot;The only timewe'd reject a credit application would be if the person wouldnot allow us to check information in credit bureaus.&quot;   If all else fails, some privacy advocates say, you canalways try taking your business elsewhere. Says JanlorieGoldman, director of the project on privacy at the AmericanCivil Liberties Union: &quot;If one company has a less intrusivequestionnaire, use it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
