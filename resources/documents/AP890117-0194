At a conference of foreign ministers, outgoing Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz coupled praise for the Soviet Union's new opennessunder President Mikhail S. Gorbachev with criticism of some of itsallies.   He was more direct than most West European ministers, attackingCzechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria and Romania by name forpolice crackdowns on dissidents and persecution of minorities.   Shultz and his colleagues gathered at the end of a 27-monthconference to review the 1975 Helsinki agreements on Europeansecurity and cooperation, including human rights. The Helsinkiaccords were signed by 35 countries: the United States, Canada andall European nations except Albania.   Delegates had barely adopted their final document Sunday whenCzechoslovak riot police crushed a rally in Prague.   The police used water cannons and tear gas again Monday andTuesday on dissidents honoring Jan Palach. The 20-year-old studentburned himself alive Jan. 16, 1969, to protest the Soviet-ledinvasion of the previous August that ended Czechoslovakia's brief``Prague Spring'' liberalization.   In Leipzig on Sunday, East German police arrested scores of humanrights demonstrators.   Shultz departed from his prepared text Tuesday to declare thepolice actions ``in glaring contradiction to the solemninternational commitments'' just made in Vienna by those governments.   Romania told delegates to the review conference Sunday, beforeadoption of the final statement on human rights and security, itwould not honor provisions on greater religious freedom andemigration.   Shultz did not raise that issue specifically, but criticizedRomania for increasing repression and shortages of food, heat andpower endured by its 23 million citizens.   ``In Romania the economic and social conditions, as well as thepolitical and civil rights of all citizens, are being eroded at adiscouraging rate,'' he said, ``and in both Romania and Bulgaria,minorities have been particularly hard hit by government policies ofrecent years.''   He praised the Soviet Union for a nine-year high in Jewishemigration and release of more than 600 prisoners of conscience, butnoted that ``others continue to suffer repression or remain unjustlyimprisoned for acting upon their human rights.''   ``We cannot forget them,'' he said.   Both the Kremlin and the West have praised the agreement, whichprovides for new negotiations on reducing conventional militaryforces, formation of groups to monitor compliance with human rightsagreements, and for greater freedom of travel, emigration andinformation.   Announcements that the Soviets will begin a unilateral withdrawalof 50,000 troops from Eastern Europe in April strengthened hopesthat the talks set for March in Vienna will lead to reductedconventional forces on the continent.   Shultz said, however: ``We have a long way to go yet to achievereal peace in Europe.''   At a news conference, the secretary called the Berlin Wall, ``aninhumane structure'' symbolizing the repression of the Soviet blocand said it should be torn down.   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, in another tough speechfocused on human rights, also called for destruction of the ``ColdWar anachronism'' built by the Soviets and East Germans in 1961.   ``It is the most public symbol of the divide between freedom onone side and its denial on the other,'' Howe said. ``The Berlin Wallmocks all our work to remove barriers to contact and understanding.''   Howe also spoke of Britain's agreement in Vienna to attend ahuman rights conference in Moscow in 1991, which the Soviets havesought for some time.   But in London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher deplored theviolent break-up of Czech demonstrations and threatened to boycottthe conference unless the Soviets make sustained progress on humanrights.   Mrs. Thatcher told Parliament many Britons ``were somewhatdismayed'' by television scenes showing peaceful demonstrationsbeing ``forcibly broken up.''   ``I think it fully justifies the approach that we took on thehuman rights conference in Moscow, that we would not go unlesscertain strict criteria were met,'' she said.   The Women's Campaign for Soviet Jewry, a British group opposed tothe Moscow conference, heckled ministers as they arrived forTuesday's meeting.   ``You sold out Soviet Jews too cheaply!'' Joyce Simpson andElizabeth Philips shouted as Shultz arrived.   Howe said Britain would continue monitoring the Soviet humanrights record and would attend the conference only if reform wastranslated into Soviet law and Britain is ``convinced that Sovietcommitment to change is genuine and irreversible.''   Foreign Minister Alois Mock of Austria spoke out againstrepression in the East bloc, as did Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway,Hans van den Broek of the Netherlands and others.   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union wasto arrive in Vienna on Wednesday and speak Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
