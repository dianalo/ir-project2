Asthe White House-approved civil rights compromise heads forlikely Senate passage this week, the greatest impact forbusiness will be an increase in the cost of lawsuits broughtby women and the disabled who successfully sue for deliberatejob discrimination.   Until the White House and Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.),chief sponsor of the bill, reached an agreement late Thursdaynight, President Bush alleged the measure would causeemployers to hire racial minorities on the basis of strictpercentages to avoid lawsuits charging indirectdiscrimination. But once the deal was struck, quotas proved aphony divide.</LP><TEXT>   Even as the White House late last week proclaimed thepolitically explosive quota issue dead, it was largelyembracing a position it had previously abhorred.   &quot;The basic standard that we had wanted in the law is partof this compromise,&quot; said Kerry Scanlon, assistant counsel ofthe NAACP Legal Defense Fund.   If the bill clears Congress and is signed by thepresident, as expected, businesses will have to contend lesswith any real or imagined quotas than with a likely increasein lawsuits from women alleging deliberate sex-basedemployment discrimination, including sexual harassment.Although women have been able to sue for sex discriminationin the past, the bill would allow them for the first time toreceive jury awards for punitive damages. Punitive damagesare awarded in civil cases to punish or deter a defendant'sconduct and are separate from compensatory damages, which areintended to reimburse a plaintiff for injuries or harm.   In addition, businesses would likely face more lawsuitsfrom the disabled. Handicapped individuals who pressdisability-related job-bias claims in court received a strongboost from last year's Americans With Disabilities Act, butthat bill failed to determine the damages available to thosewho won such lawsuits. Under the civil rights agreement,disabled people could receive punitive damages.   Punitive damages also would be available to plaintiffs whosue for job discrimination based on religion, though suchlawsuits aren't expected to rise as rapidly as those based onsex or disability.   From a political standpoint, the most contentious issuesurrounding the civil rights bill was indirectdiscrimination.   In the past, lawsuits have been filed by blacks whoalleged that certain employment practices, such as a jobskills test, have the effect of indirectly screening outAfrican-Americans who seek a job or a promotion. Similarlawsuits have been filed by other ethnic groups and by women.The threat of such lawsuits, conservatives argue, has causedemployers to adopt quotas. But employers have been able towin such lawsuits by demonstrating that the practice underattack is justified by &quot;business necessity.&quot;   A 1989 Supreme Court decision in Wards Cove Packing Co.vs. Atonio made it easier for employers in such lawsuits toprove &quot;business necessity.&quot; Although the Bush White House andCongress eventually agreed that the decision should be atleast partly reversed, they argued endlessly over how todefine &quot;business necessity.&quot; Meanwhile, the White Housepressured Fortune 500 executives to discontinue negotiationsover the issue with civil rights groups, leading tospeculation that it didn't want a bill at all.   In the end, the negotiators agreed to disagree: The billdoesn't formally define &quot;business necessity,&quot; though itincludes some language on the issue more favorable to civilrights groups than to the White House. Instead, the billmandates a return to the concept of &quot;business necessity&quot; asenunciated by the Supreme Court prior to the Wards Covedecision, effectively removing the controversy from thepolitical arena to the courts -- where civil rights groupsare betting they will get a more sympathetic hearing.   Now that the White House has resolved the quota issue,even the bill's most vociferous opponents are conceding thatthe charge was a distraction. &quot;The quota issue was not assubstantive as originally made out,&quot; said Martin Payson, apartner in the law firm Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler andamp; Krutman,which represents companies against discrimination suits. JohnMotley, lobbyist for the National Federation of IndependentBusiness, added, &quot;The people who care about disparate impactare the lawyers at the White House.&quot;   While the new bill would restore rights that wereavailable to victims of race discrimination as recently as1989, women would win an entirely new right: access topunitive damages.   Under current law, women who sue for intentional sex-basedemployment discrimination can't receive punitive damages.This places women on an unequal footing with victims ofintentional race-based job discrimination, who are eligiblefor punitive damages under a 19th century law.   Women's groups have been vociferous in their demand forunlimited punitive damages, while the White House waspreviously willing to offer only limited access to suchdamages, and then only in cases involving sexual harassment.The civil rights compromise adopted, in slightly alteredform, a provision proposed by Sen. Danforth: that punitivedamages be available to women in job-bias cases up to acapped amount determined by the size of the company beingsued.   Under the bill, punitive damages in sex discriminationcases would be capped at $50,000 for firms of 100 or feweremployees; at $100,000 for firms with 100 to 500 employees;and $300,000 for firms with more than 500 employees. Firmswith fewer than 15 employees would be exempt.   The bill's provisions on punitive damages would also bringsignificant rights to the disabled.   Under last year's Americans With Disabilities Act, whichhad the strong backing of the Bush administration, thehandicapped for the first time received employment statusroughly equivalent to that enjoyed by minorities and womenunder the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act. But thedisabilities act didn't spell out the punitive damagesavailable to individuals who sue employers fordisability-related discrimination. Under the civil rightscompromise, plaintiffs who win such lawsuits could receivethe same damages as sex-discrimination plaintiffs.   Eventually, both women and the handicapped may gain evengreater access to punitive damages, even if Congress doesn'tact. Mr. Payson, the employment attorney, said that it ispossible the courts might rule the civil rights bill'spunitive-damages provision unconstitutional on the groundthat it violates the equal-protection clause, since employeesof smaller companies wouldn't enjoy the same rights asemployees of larger ones. If that happens, both groups mightend up being eligible for unlimited punitive damages.   In addition, if an amendment that Sen. Charles Grassley(R., Iowa) plans to introduce is accepted, job-bias victimswill have a right they never enjoyed before -- the right tosue a member of Congress for job discrimination.</TEXT></DOC>
