(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Evan Mecham was told that one of hisaides might have committed a felony, tampering with a grand jurywitness, the governor's former chief of security testified atMecham's impeachment trial Tuesday.   As the opening day of testimony closed in the first impeachmenttrial of a U.S. governor in six decades, lawyers were questioningCharles ``Beau'' Johnson, who once supervised security for thegovernor's every move.   Mecham has said under oath that he was not told about an allegeddeath threat by one of his aides against a grand jury witness andwasn't aware it might have been a crime.   Johnson's testimony came at the end of a day that featuredopening statements by both sides, a state Supreme Court refusal tostop the impeachment trial, and confusion over whether Mecham hadtried from his suburban ``government in exile'' to contact thetrial's first witness during a lunch break. There also was a lowercourt ruling refusing a move by Mecham supporters to block a recallelection scheduled for May.   Johnson said he went to the governor as soon as he knew aboutthe situation and researched the law to determine that if theallegation was true it was a felony.   The governor has claimed that Johnson ``mumbled'' when theytalked and said nothing about the possibly criminal nature of thesituation. Mecham is accused of obstructing justice by thwartingthe official investigation of the alleged threat.   Johnson insisted he personally told the governor a felony mighthave occurred.   ``Lieutenant, is there any question in your mind that thegovernor understood the problem?''asked prosecutor William French.   ``He never asked me to repeat anything,'' said Johnson.   However, he said he never mentioned the words, ``death threat.''   Frank Martinez, a state Department of Public Safety officer whotestified both Tuesday morning and afternoon, told the Senate hehung up the phone before the governor could talk to him.   Mecham, absent from the impeachment trial for a second day,issued a statement denying the story. His spokesman said thegovernor made a mistake and asked for the wrong officer, asking for``Frank'' when he meant ``Dave.''   On Tuesday night, Department of Public Safety Sgt. Allan Schmidtsaid the incident had been difficult to sort out, but ``we acceptthat the scenario they (the governor's office) are putting out isaccurate.''   He said a mistake may have been made in trying to put Martinezin touch with Mecham.   In his ruling, the state Supreme Court denied the request byMecham's lawyers in a 4-0 ruling. The governor's lawyers hadcontended that his constitutional right to a fair trial in criminalcourt would be jeopardized by allowing the impeachment to proceednow.   However, the Supreme Court said the Senate's impeachment trialis not a criminal proceeding. Rather, the court said, theimpeachment trial is a legislative proceeding solely intended todecide whether to remove a state officer.   Friday, the court had denied a request from Mecham's lawyersthat it delay Monday's start of the impeachment trial. The courthad said it would consider during its Tuesday conference a requestfrom Mecham's lawyers for an injunction against the trial.   The governor was the subject of both praise and denunications asattorneys delivered opening statements.   ``There's something wrong in this state when you can take anelected official and throw the book at him ... on the basis ofwitnesses who have a stake in his being outsted,'' defense attorneyFred Craft said in a loud, feverish statement to state senators whoare sitting as judge and jury.   ``What the facts are going to demonstrate is you had a mutiny,''said Craft, Mecham's former lobbyist in Washington. Several of theofficials involved in allegations against Mecham, he noted, were inoffice before Mecham was inaugurated in January 1987.   The attorney, warning of personal attacks to come on Mechamassociates, said he might be forced to ``take our dirty laundry outand lay it before the world.''   It has been reported that Craft will attack the credibility ofDirector of Public Safety Ralph Milstead, one of the key witnessesagainst Mecham, by alleging Milstead had sexual affairs withmembers of his staff.   Milstead issued a short statement Tuesday afternoon saying thesexual allegations are ``a ridiculous bunch of lies andintolerable.''   Craft's emotional opening followed a quieter presentation byprosecutor William French, who said he would prove the governorbroke the law when he allegedly ordered Milstead to resistcooperating with an investigation of an alleged death threat by aMecham aide.   ``The governor's conduct surrounding this threat was positivelywrong, without lawful authority. He violated his oath of office andobstructed justice,'' said French.   French, who is serving as a prosecutor for the state House,warned senators that the defense would try to divert theirattention from the governor and to ``prosecute'' others. Heimplored them: ``Don't be distracted. Keep your eye on the ball.''   With Mecham again absent from the proceedings which could endhis political career, testimony began on the first of three chargesagainst him _ the obstruction of justice allegation.   Mecham, a Republican, also is accused of improperly concealing a$350,000 campaign loan and misusing $80,000 from the governor'sprotocol fund by loaning it to his car dealership.   The opening statements Tuesday only dealt with the allegedthreat because the Senate agreed to consider one section of thearticles of impeachment at a time.   In his testinomy, Martinez offered a rough outline of the eventsbehind the obstruction of justice claim.   The 28 senators present Tuesday in the contemporary, reddihwood-paneled Senate chamber listened intently as Martinez spokefrom the witness stand elevated at the front of the semi-circularroom. Seated next to the witness stand was Frank X. Gordon, chiefjustice of the Arizona Supreme Court, who is serving as referee inthe proceeding. Four clerks sat below Gordon.   Several senators, seated at individual desks, took notes onyellow legal pads.   The gallery was only partly filled with spectators andreporters, including former Nixon White House aide John Ehrlichman,who went to prison in the Watergate scandal and is covering theimpeachment proceeding for Rolling Stone magazine.   Martinez, who was assigned to Mecham's security detail, said hewas on duty last Nov. 13 when Mecham administration official PeggyGriffith came to the detail's office appearing ``nervous, excitedand in need to speak to someone.''   Martinez said Mrs. Griffith spilled out details of a parking lotconfrontation with Lee Watkins, a senior aide of the governor, inwhich Watkins allegedly threatened the life of another Mechamassistant, Donna Carlson, who was believed to be testifying beforea grand jury investigating the loan.   He said Mrs. Griffith told of being confronted by Watkins whosaid: ``Your friend's been a naughty girl.''   ``Mr. Watkins then went on to say if she (Ms. Carlson) keptacting as she did she could take a long boat ride,'' Martinez said,quoting Mrs. Griffith.   The officer said he reported the matter to his superior, Lt.Beau Johnson, who consulted others. Eventually, it was reported tothe attorney general's office, he said.   The end result, Martinez said, was a meeting with Milstead twodays later in which Johnson was removed from command of thegovernor's security detail.   ``What did Mr. Milstead say?'' asked prosecutor Paul Eckstein.   ``That he had advised the governor what took place,'' saidMartinez. ``... The governor was very upset and angry. He asked forLt. Johnson to be transferred. He said he didn't want to have himcooperating with the attorney general and it would cost Lt. Johnsonhis job.''   Asked why he reported Mrs. Griffith's comments in the firstplace, Martinez said: ``In my opinion, the commission of a crimehad taken place.''   Mecham also faces a May 17 recall election and a March 22 trialon felony charges accusing him of concealing the loan.   The recall passed another hurdle Tuesday when Maricopa CountySuperior Court Judge Frederick Martone ruled that a pro-Mechamgroup, Concerned Arizona Voters, hadn't produced evidence ofwidespread fraud in the petition signatures that put the recall onthe ballot.   ``Plaintiffs have failed to show ... that the consequence offraud would be to invalidate enough signatures as to fall below theconstitutional threshold'' for signatures necessary to force arecall, Martone said. The recall backers had turned in about 80,000more petition signatures than the minimum needed for a recall vote.   Concerned Arizona Voters had contended in its suit that theelection should be stopped and a ``special master'' be appointed toinvestigate possible fraud.</TEXT></DOC>
