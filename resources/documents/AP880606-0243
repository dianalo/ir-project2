There are several ways to sharpen hooks, but they basically arevariables on two themes _ a tapered point and a designed point. Youcan go either way, but sharpen every hook one way or the other.   There are mechanical sharpeners which will produce needle pointsthat are needle sharp.   ``The needle is the natural shape in nature. If it weren't thebest way to puncture, animals wouldn't have evolved needle-shapedincisor teeth,'' according to Doug Hannon, who recommends the HookHone, a battery operated sharpener.   It puts a needle-sharp point on any hook in seconds.   John Juranitch, president of Razor Edge Systems, edge consultantsfrom Ely, Minn., recommends the designed hook, with three cuttingedges which cut into the bone of a fish's jaw. A three-sided point,with a flat face on the stem side of the point, ``attacks anysurface it touches,'' he said.   He recommends sharpening the three faces to create the threesharp cutting edges.   In addition, Juranitch said, it is critical that the point of thehook face the direction of travel. The point should be in line withthe shank of the hook, not curved in toward it, or pointed to a side.</TEXT></DOC>
