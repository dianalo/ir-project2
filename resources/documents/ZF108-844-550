One of those big, inflexible, RAM-sucking LANs hasalready been put into place by the powers that be? Don't surrender.andP;  You'regreat at getting the most from your applications, right? And a LAN is nothingmore than a great big application, right?andM;Be a guerrilla.andP;  Bend that impersonal network to your will.andP;  Learn how to getwhat you want from your LAN.andM;Guerrilla networking.andP;  LANs you can create on your own.andP;  Techniques formaking existing networks your own.andM;Go for it.andM;A network for everymanandM;THE BENEFITS OF NETWORKING electronic mail and file transfer, the sharing ofprinters and applications-have long been enjoyed by large organizations.andO;Only they could afford the necessary LAN hardware and software, not tomention the luxury of having a full-time network administrator to maintainthe beast.andM;But what if you're part of a small group of PC users-in a non-networkedoutpost of a large company, say, or in a small office of your own? What ifonly you and your assistant want to share files, applications andperipherals? Does that mean you'll never know the joys of networking?andM;The answer is no.andP;  In an afternoon or evening, you can easily rig a smallnetwork for two to six people.andP;  And you can do it for about what you'd payfor a high-end spreadsheet or desktop publishing program.andM;Before buying a do-it-yourself network, make sure it's what you truly need.andO;If all you want is printer sharing and simple file transfers for up to fourpeople, you can get by with a  &quot;sub-LAN&quot; such as PC InterLink, from SoftWorxInc. in Richardson, Texas (214-480-8278), which does all that for $169.95 fortwo users or $229.95 for four users.andM;But if you need more-if you want to share disk resources, files andapplications as well as electronic mail-you'll need a full-blown network.andM;We looked at five networks that cost  500 or less for two people.andP;  Of those,the best is clearly LAN-tastic, from Artisoft in Tucson, Arizona(602-293-6363).andM;LANtastic is inexpensive  $525 for a two-node, 2-megabit-per-second version;$249 for each additional node) and exceptionally easy to install andtroubleshoot.andP;  Like larger, more expensive networks, it offers many levels ofsecurity, sophisticated print queue management and network caching.andM;Artisoft's line of networks ranges from a slower, zero-slot version ($199),which can link only two PCS, to the 2Mbps version we used, all the way up toversions that run at 10Mbps on Ethernet cards ($725 for a two-node network;$349 for each additional node).andM;The company also sells LANtastic-compatible accessories.andP;  The voice-mailoption ($149) includes a card and telephone handset to attach to your PC.andO;When you call another person on the network, you can talk through yourhandsets as if they were an intercom.andP;  If the person isn't there, you canleave a voice message that can be played back on the PC.andM;Artisoft also offers a number of add-on programs, as well as hints for usingLANtastic, through a company-sponsored bulletin board  602-293-0065).andM;SIX STEPS TO INSTALLING A LANTASTIC NETWORK.andP;  It's easy to put together atwo-person network with LANtastic.andP;  Here's how to do it.andP;  Let's assume youhave a 386 PC linked to an ink jet printer for drafts and privatecorrespondence while your assistant has a 286 PC and a laser printer, whichboth of you use for the bulk of your printing.andM;You want your network to:andM;1.andP;  Let you print directly on your assistant's laser but keep the ink jet foryour use alone.andM;2.andP;  Allow you and your assistant to exchange messages via electronic mail.andM;3.andP;  Let you and your assistant transfer files directly from one PC to theother.andM;4.andP;  Enable shared access to certain files and applications-your calendar andyour expense reports, for example.andM;A two-node LANtastic network will easily do it all.andP;  When you open the box,you'll find two network cards, some cable, network software and thedocumentation.andM;STEP 1 .andP;  Install Network CardsandM;Start by installing the LANtastic network cards on both machines.andO;LANtastic's card has only a single switch bank that you probably won't needto touch; in all but rare cases, the factory setting will work.andP;  All you'llprobably have to do is take the case off your computer and install the board.andM;That's not to say that there aren't potential conflicts between LANtastic andyour PC and software.andP;  Must problems that you encounter, however, can beresolved by issuing software commands.andM;The most common conflict occurs when the network card tries to use the samehardware interrupt (called an IRQ) as a card or device in your PC, such as amouse, internal modem or serial port.andP;  Before installing the network card,pull out your manuals and note which interrupts those boards and devices use.andO;Or look at the boards; sometimes jumpers on them will indicate which IRQsthey use.andP;  If you still can't tell, get a system analysis program such asManifest (59.95 from Quarterdeck Office Systems, 213-392-9851) or  SystemSleuth ($149 from Dariana Technology Group, 714-994-7400), which will checkout your system and report which IRQs are in use.andM;Hint: If your system uses COM1: for a modem, it's using IRQ 4.andP;  COM2:occupies IRQ 3.andP;  If you can't recall which COM port you're using, load yourcommunications software and find its configuration menu.andM;LANtastic network cards default to IRQ 3.andP;  If there's a conflict, you won'tneed to pull a board and reset the jumpers, as you'd have to do with othernetwork cards.andP;  Instead, issue a command telling the board which IRQ to use.andO;If your assistant's internal modem uses IRQ 3, for instance, change theinterrupt on his or her network card by typingandM;LANBIOS2 IRQ=4 at the command line or including it in a batch file forloading the network software (see Step 4), and the LANtastic card will usethat interrupt.andM;STEP 2.andP;  Cable PCs and Run Installation SoftwareandM;After installing cards on both PCs, connect them with the cable provided byLANtastic.andP;  Then run the installation program on both hard disks.andP;  For now,let the network software use its defaults; later, you'll customize the batchand configuration files it creates.andM;The installation program will ask you to name the computers and supplypasswords for each user.andP;  In this example, you'll call your PC 386 and yourassistant's XT.andP;  Designate a user name and password of BOSS and HONCHO foryou, ASSIST and GOFER for your assistant.andM;Make sure, during installation, to specify that you want to set up bothmachines as both servers and workstations.andP;  LANtastic is a peer-to-peernetwork, which means that every computer on it can be configured for bothfunctions so that you don't need to dedicate a computer to run the networkfull-time.andP;  If the need arises, however, you can dedicate PCs to eitherfunction.andM;STEP 3.andP;  Establish Shared Resources and Access LevelsandM;It's time to specify which resources-printers, disks and subdirectories-youand your assistant will share and which you'll keep to yourselves.andM;Switch to the LANtastic directory on the 386 and type NET__MGR.andP;  The networkmanager menu will appear.andP;  Select the Shared Resource Management option.andO;Your screen will display a list of shared resources that the software foundduring installation.andP;  In this case, the resources found on your 386 arefloppy drives A: and B:, a hard disk with partitions C:, D: and E: and theink jet printer.andM;At first, all your disk resources (down to the drive level) and the printerwill be listed as shared resources.andP;  To make a resource private, eliminate itfrom the menu.andP;  Because you don't want your assistant to have access to yourfloppy drives, you'll start by eliminating them: Simply move your cursor totheir entries and hit the Delete key.andP;  That still leaves your three hard diskpartitions.andP;  In two of them--C: and D:--you will be keeping confidentialinformation, so delete them from the listing as well.andM;You want your final partition, E:, to be available to you both as a sharedresource.andP;  It's the one your assistant will use to send you files; you'llalso use it to test new software, and you'd like your assistant to try outthe programs as well.andP;  So leave E: on the menu (though it's your E: drive, itbecomes network drive D: on your assistant's XT).andM;Repeat this process on the XT.andP;  Pull up the shared resource menu and deletefloppy drives A: and B: from the menu.andP;  Also, to allow some privacy, deleteyour assistant's C: drive from the menu.andM;Next, create three shared subdirectories: one for your calendar, another foryour expense report and a third for other shared files.andM;The first subdirectory is called \CAL on your assistant's C: drive (eventhough you've deleted the drive from the shared resource menu, you canspecify subdirectories of C: that can be shared).andP;  Press Insert; a promptsaying &quot;Enter resource name:&quot; will appear.andP;  Whatever you type will be thename by which the subdirectory will be known on the network-in this case,CALENDAR.andP;  Then type in the name of the subdirectory, C:\CAL.andP;  You can nowaccess the \CAL subdirectory on the XT by switching to your F: drive, whichLANtastic created during installation.andM;Now set up access privileges for CALENDAR.andP;  You decide that only yourassistant, who maintains your schedule, should be able to make changes to it.andO;But you still need to be able to read it.andP;  So, on the shared resource menu,select CALENDAR and press Enter.andP;  Up pops the Access Control List, whichdefines the access that network users will have to the XT's C:\CALsubdirectory.andP;  There are a dozen types of access; check the LANtastic manualfor a full rundown.andP;  LANtastic's default allows full access to all sharedresources.andP;  To be more selective, hit F4 to clear all the access levels.andO;Then add the levels you want to establish for the resource.andM;In this instance, you want three types of access to CALENDAR.andP;  First, youwant to be able to run the calendar program from your 386, so make sure theaccess list includes E, for &quot;Execute Program.&quot; Next, you want to be able toread your calendar files, so include R, for &quot;Read Access.&quot; Finally, you wantto be able to see what files are included in the subdirectory, so specify L,for &quot;File Lookups.&quot;andM;Besides overseeing your schedule, your assistant keeps track of your expensesin a subdirectory named \MONEY.andP;  Create a new network resource calledEXPENSE, which is the network name for the C:\MONEY subdirectory.andP;  Again,give yourself only E, R and L access rights to it.andP;  LANtastic turns this intoyour network's G: drive.andM;Create another network resource for a subdirectory on the XT's hard diskcalled \SHARE, which you'll use to send files to your assistant.andP;  Giveyourself full rights to this directory, which will appear to your 386 as theH: drive.andM;Finally, decide who has access to printers.andP;  You want to keep your ink jetprinter to yourself, so delete it from the shared resource list on yourcomputer.andP;  But you want to be able to print from your assistant's laser, soleave it on the shared resource list on the XT.andM;If the laser printer is not on the list of shared resources, run NET__MGR andcreate a network resource for the printer by hitting Insert.andP;  When typing inthe resource name, make sure to type an @ sign first, like this: @PRINTER.andO;Make sure to include in the entry the printer port your assistant uses (mostlikely it will be LPT1:).andM;STEP 4.andP;  Load Network SoftwareandM;You're now ready to load the LANtastic software.andP;  Since the 386 and the XTwill each function as a server and a workstation, you'll put the server andworkstation software on both machines.andM;First, create a batch file like this one to load the necessary software ontoyour machine:andM;\DOS\FASTOPEN C: D: E:andM;\DOS\SHAREandM;LANBIOS2andM;REDIR 386 LOGINS=2andM;SERVERandM;FASTOPEN loads DOS's FASTOPEN program for your machine's physical drives C:,D: and E:, which will speed some network tasks.andP;  The DOS SHARE commandenables record locking and file sharing.andP;  The LANBIOS command loads theLANtastic operating system, the REDIR command installs the workstationsoftware, and the LOGINS parameter allows you to do two network tasks at atime (two is the recommended number for a small network).andP;  SERVER loads theLANtastic server software.andP;  Your assistant's batch file should look likeyours, with a few differences.andP;  The XT has an internal modem that uses IRQ 3,so you'll have to reset the IRQ interrupt (see Step 1).andP;  The batch fileshould look like this:andM;\DOS\FASTOPEN C:andM;\DOS\SHAREandM;IANBIOS2 IRQ=4andM;REDIR XT LOGINS=2andM;SERVERandM;Unlike many networks, LANtastic is no memory glutton.andP;  The network operatingsystem takes up 1.5K.andP;  If you configure your machine as a workstation, ittakes 11K; as a server, 23 to 27K; and if you want it to function as both (asin this example), it takes 34 to 38K.andM;Even though LANtastic makes sparing use of memory, you may want to load thenetwork software into the 386's high memory area using a memory manager suchas Quarterdeck's QEMM.andP;  You may not have enough high memory to accommodateall the network software, however.andP;  The server software in particular may bea problem-although it consumes only 23 to 27K while it sits in memory, itrequires more during loading.andM;A few other caveats about loading high: With an EMS board on a 286 you'll runinto trouble because that board tries to use the same memory as does theLANtastic board.andP;  There can be video conflicts as well.andP;  Use System Sleuth ormanifest to find a contiguous block of 32K bytes of memory that isn't in use,and then tell the LANtastic board to use that memory.andP;  If you find, forexample, the memory address C000-C7FF free, put the following command in yourCONFIG.SYS file:andM;LANBIOS2 RAMbase=C000-C7FF If this doesn't resolve the problem, cheek yourmemory board to see if you can relocate the memory it uses.andM;Even on a 386, you might run into a conflict if you use a multitaskingoperating system such as Desqview.andP;  You have to exclude Desqview frompoaching on LANtastic memory.andP;  Using QEMM, this would mean putting thefollowing line in your CONFIG.SYS:andM;DEVICE=QEMM.SYS RAM EXCLUDE=D00-DFFF If you have no high memory and can'tafford to give up those precious few kilobytes, you can buy a $99daughterboard from Artisoft.andP;  The board plugs into your network card andallows network software to be loaded into it.andM;STEP 5.andP;  Write Login Scripts to Access Shared ResourcesandM;Now you've loaded network software on both machines, but you still haven'taccessed any network resources.andP;  You'll have to log in and ask to get at thenetwork resources you set up with NET__MGR in Step 3.andM;For the 386, set up a batch file with the following commands (the fileassumes that your user name and password are BOSS and HONCHO):andM;NET LOGIN \ \386 BOSS HONCHOandM;NET LOGIN/WAIT \ \XT BOSS HONCHOandM;NET ATRACH/VERBOSE \ \XTandM;NET USE LPT2 \\XT\@PRINTERandM;NET QUEUE START \\XTandM;NET LPT TIMEOUT 1andM;:ENDandM;The first login command logs you into your own machine on the network.andP;  (Ifyou're worried about security, don't include this command in your batch file.andO;Type LoGIN 386 at the command line, and you'll be prompted for your user nameand password.)andM;The second logs you into your assistant's XT.andP;  The WAIT switch will stopexecuting the rest of the batch file if XT isn't found on the network.andP;  YourPC will wait, continually polling the network until XT logs in.andP;  If you'drather not wait, hit Esc, and the PC will go directly to :END at the bottomof the file.andM;Once your PC does find XT, the ATTACH command links you to all the XT'snetwork resources except the printer.andP;  NET USE LPT2 \\XT\@PRINTER links youtO the XT's laser (while the laser is LPT1: on the XT's system, it will beLPT2: on yours, since you want to use your LPT1: for your ink jet).andP;  NETQUEUE START \\XT starts the XT's printer queue.andM;NET LPT TIMEOUT 1 makes sure that all your programs can print through thenetwork.andP;  (Some applications handle printer output in a way that keeps youfrom sending files directly to the network printer-you have to exit theapplication first.andP;  The TIMEOUT command gets around that problem, sending theprint command after a certain interval, in this instance one second.andP;  You canchange the interval to as much as an hour.)andM;To log on to the XT manually, wait for XT to log on, type NET LOGIN \\XT BOSSHONCHO to log on to the XT and NET ATTACH \\XT to get at your assistant'sresources.andP;  When you use the /VERBOSE switch, you'll get an onscreen reportdetailing the network resources available to you.andM;The XT's batch file should be similar to yours:andM;NET LOGIN \\XT ASSIST GOFERandM;NET LOGIN/WAIT \\386 ASSIST GOFERandM;NET ATTACH/VERBOSE \ \386andM;NET USE LPT1 \ \XT\ @ PRINTERandM;NET QUEUE START \ \XTandM;NET LPT TIMEOUT 1andM;:ENDandM;If security is a concern, omit the first line of the batch file and have yourassistant log in manually as you would on your own machine, as describedabove.andM;STEP 6.andP;  Enjoy Your Network !andP;  You're both now attached to all networkresources.andP;  You can use them as if they were attached to your PC.andP;  Yourassistant can log on to your E: drive, which will appear as the D: drive onthe XT.andP;  You can log on to the XT's\CAL, \MONEY and \SHARE subdirectories,which are your F:, G: and H: drives, respectively.andM;LANtastic uses menu-driven software to give you full access to even morenetwork resources.andP;  Type NET, and the network menu pops up.andP;  From here youcan create, send and receive electronic mail, control printing jobs, changenetwork passwords and further customize a variety of network options.andM;You can still use your own PC's resources in the usual fashion.andP;  For example,go to the F: drive, load the calendar software and check out the scheduleyour assistant has prepared for you.andP;  To send a file called MYFILE to the\SHARE subdirectory, use the DOS copy command: copy C:\MYFILE H:\SHARE.andP;  Toprint on your ink jet, print as you normally would; to use the laser, printto LPT2: instead.andM;To send electronic mail, type NET at the command line to bring up the networkmenu.andP;  Then follow the menu-driven prompts for creating and sending mail.andO;Either use LANtastic's mail editor to create a message or create the messagefirst in your own word processor and send the file via e-mail.andP;  You can alsosend binary files such as spreadsheets in this manner.andM;Enjoy your network !andP;  MORE POWER TO YOU: FOUR OTHER LOW-COST LANSandM;Though LANtastic is the best do-it-yourself network you can find for about500, it isn't the only one.andP;  Invisible Software Not/30 This well-designednetwork comes up slightly short when compared with LANtastic.andP;  Softwareinstallation is exceptionally easy, but hardware installation is not.andP;  You'relikely to spend time setting jumpers and, if you run into conflicts,reinstalling network cards.andP;  Once the hardware and software are installed,you'll find Net/30 very easy to run.andP;  Menu-driven services make it easy tomop drives, connect to printers, set security levels and perform othernetwork functions.andP;  Network software occupies 30K to 70K.andP;  The Not/30 driverscon be loaded int memory.andP;  With the right configuration, you'll use only 3Kon a workstation.andP;  The network also features the clearest documentationwritten for these LANs.andM;The Net/30 doesn't support as many add-ons as LANtastic does--there's no wayto shore modems, for example.andP;  And LANtastic has mare network services.andO;Still, this is a top network choice.andM;Two-node starter kit with 8-bit 1.8Mbps cards, $430 ($215 per nodethereafter); two-node starter kit of 16-bit 3Mbps cards, $630 ($315 per nodethereafter);

 The awful documentation only makes things worse.andP;  Evenveteran networkers have been stymied by PowerLan.andM;Once it's up and running, PowerLan offers a full set of network services, andwhile it tends to be RAM-hungry (87K per server, 42K per workstation),programs can be loaded high, freeing memory.andM;Two-node starter kit, $499;

 in theory, it'seasy to install not many jumpers need be sat on the network cards, andsoftware installation is also simple.andP;  Solid troubleshooting software isincluded.andM;But ReadyNot is prone to hardware and software conflicts.andP;  in rare instances,its software may not run with your version of DOS, although patches areavailable.andP;  And, once installed, it's not as easy to use or customize asLANtastic.andP;  One of ReadyNet's biggest drawbacks is memory consumption--ittakes a whopping 184K per server and 60K per workstation.andM;Two-node startup kit, $499 ($249 per node thereafter);

 You won't have totouch a jumper, and installing the software is a cinch: After completing abrief question-and-answer session, you're ready to go to work.andP;  All networkfunctions are accessible from a simple pop-up menu, and the documentation isa model of clarity.andM;MainLan suffers from two problems, however.andP;  One of them is memory.andP;  Each ofthe machines on the network requires 177K of RAM, and the MainLan networkdrivers can't be loaded high.andP;  You can free memory by disabling certainfeatures, but doing so will leave you with less than a full-fledged network.andM;The second problem is that most network features are available only vic thenetwork menu--there's no way for you to access them from your command line,which makes the network inflexible and time-consuming to run.andM;Two-node startup kit,  499 ($199 per node thereafter).andM;US Sage Inc.andM;2005 Tree Fork LaneandM;Suite 113andM;Longwood, Fla.andP;

 And because many low-end LANs work with proprietary networkinterface cards, they cannot be upgraded to a Novell system without asignificant investment in now cards.andM;Novell offers a solution: the Entry-Level System (ELS) products, designed forsmall to midsize businesses that expect to expand their networks.andP;  ELS isavailable in two versions, Level I Version 2.12 and Level II Version 2.15.andO;Both offer the advanced security and printer-sharing features found inNovell's Advanced 286 and 386 products.andP;  They con be installed on any of thethree industry-standard network topologies--Aranet, Ethernet and IBMToken-Ring.andM;ELS Levels I and II are based on client-server architecture.andP;  Novell allowsyou to configure the server PC to operate in dedicated or non-dedicated mode;dedicated file servers can be used only to run the network operating system,not as workstations for data entry, while non-dedicated ones can do both atonce.andM;Anyone familiar with the basics of DOS can handle ELS NetWare Level I.andO;installation of the operating system requires answering only three questions.andO;Although it supports no more than four users, ELS NetWare Level I offers manyhigh-end features, such as directory and disk caching to speed performanceand &quot;hot fixing&quot; to detect and compensate for hard disk media defects.andO;Accounting features enable supervisors to bill for network usage.andM;ELS Level II goes beyond that, offering a fullfledged version of AdvancedNetWare 286 with only minor functional limitations.andP;  it supports eight usersat one time.andP;  in Level II, you con use Novell's Service Advertising Protocol,which lets you conned to other networks through gateways or via a bridge thatresides outside the file server.andP;  Although it can be difficult toinstall--don't try it without the manual--anyone familiar with DOS shouldhave little trouble.andM;Novell's NetWare Assurance Plan, which offers automatic, discounted upgrades,makes ELS an attractive option.andP;
