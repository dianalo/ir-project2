If a static electric fieldis also applied and if the atoms are initially electrically polarizedwith principal quantum number n=7, the cw infrared optical double-resonancetechnique previously used to study highly excited hydrogen atoms in intensemicrowave fields can be extended using picosecond excitation of localizedwave packets of Stark states. Employing calculations similar to thoseof Parker and Stroud, we find that at n = 60, the initial spreads inthe parabolic quantum numbers n, n/sub 1/, m can be kept below five units,while the initial spatial spreads of the electron are within 20% of theclassical outer turning point. Whereas Parker and Stroud calculated wavepackets localized into a spherical shell, our Stark wave packets areinitially localized in all three dimensions. The authors' interest inproducing such wave packets is to extend their experimental studies ofclassically stochastic many-photon microwave absorption by highly excitedhydrogen atoms.</TEXT></DOC>
