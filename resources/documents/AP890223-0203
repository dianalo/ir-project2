The kidnappers, who call themselves Islamic Jihad for theLiberation of Palestine, made the threat in an Arabic-languagestatement delivered to a Western news agency with a photograph ofhostages Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse Turner.   They pledged ``revenge on all those who took part in strong andferocious campaigns against Islam ... all institutions andorganizations that insulted in one way or another'' the prophetMohammed and his family through Rushdie's novel ``The SatanicVerses.''   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's 88-year-old Shiite Moslempatriarch, has ordered his followers to kill Rushdie.   Steen, Polhill and Turner, kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, from thecampus of Beirut University College, were shown from the knees upseated on what appeared to be a bed, looking directly into thecamera.   Polhill's left arm and hand were thinner than in a picturereleased 14 months ago and his left sleeve was pulled up to theelbow, showing what might be a deformity, but he was smiling.   Turner, 42, sat on Polhill's left clad in a striped sweater anddark trousers. Steen, 49, was on Turner's left in a dark track suit.   Steen, who is from Boston, taught journalism at the college.Polhill, 54, of New York, was assistant professor of business andTurner, of Boise, Idaho, taught mathematics and computer science.   They and six other Americans are among the 15 Western hostages inLebanon. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,1985.   Turner's wife, Badr, who knows all three men, said of Polhill'sarm: ``Maybe it's a shadow in the picture. I'm not aware that he hada deformity in his left arm and hand.''   She said the three captives have nothing to do with what thecaptors are saying.''   ``My husband looked fine, but I'm worried about theirpsychological well-being,'' Mrs. Turner, who is Lebanese, said in atelephone interview. ``We're suffering without them.'   Neither Polhill's wife, Ferial, nor Steen's wife, Virginia Rose,could be reached for comment.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said,``We hold the kidnappers fully responsible for the safety andwelfare of all the hostages. The hostages are innocent victims. Theyshould be freed immediately and unconditionally.''   In their statement, the abductors said their group had``persistently sought to find a peaceful settlement to the hostagesissue, in accordance with its principles and to show its goodintentioins in light of international detente.''   ``But it seems that Imperialism and Zionism consider that Moslemsshould go back on their beliefs and principles as if this were theprice of living in the shadow of international detente,'' thestatement said. ``We are going to shatter their dreams and foiltheir schemes.   ``American Imperialism and international Zionism should realizethat by supporting the ugly contents of The Satanic Verses they havelinked the destiny of their interests with the fate that awaits theso-called Indian author of the book as well as promoters of theanti-Islam campaign.''   The captors urged ``Moslems all over the world to stand againstthe laws of the jungle so that advocates of these laws would realizethat real human values ... lie in spiritual religions and not in thejungle's system.''   Rushdie's book is ``the worst type of insult to Islam'ssacredness in general and the sacredness of ... Islam's prophet inparticular,'' part of a ``serious and wide-ranging programs underway to strike against Islam because it is the force that fightsmoral and humanitarian degeneration,'' the kidnappers said.   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by portrayingMohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the Koran,the holy book of Islam, rather than receiving it from God.   An-Nahar, an independent Beirut newspaper, said efforts to freethe 15 hostages were undermined by the strain in Iran's relationswith the 12-nation European Economic Community caused by Khomeini'sexecution order. It did not attribute the report.   Reaction to Khomeini's death sentence has been mixed amongMoslems in Lebanon.   Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian group believed to be the umbrella forShiite extremists who hold most or all of the hostages, said astatement Khomeini's decree was ``just'' and added:   ``The publication of this book comes against a Zionist backgroundthat manifests malicious intentions scheming to defame Islam. Thisis also the purpose of the current campaign in the West,particularly in the United States and Britain.''   Hasan Saab, adviser to Sunni Moslem grand mufti Sheik HassanKhaled, declared: ``Islam does not allow the killing of man withouta trial. The Koran teaches us that the unjustified taking of onelife is tantamount to killing the whole world.''</TEXT></DOC>
