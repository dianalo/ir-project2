Half a dozen tanks stand on the treeless, snow-covered terrain tothe right of the soldiers, arranged in a rough semicircle withcannons pointed north.   Shivering in their filthy uniforms, the troops stand at the footof the vital Salang highway, three miles outside Kabul, with ordersto stop Moslem guerrillas who have isolated the city since theSoviets left the countryside.   This final line against the Moslem insurgency that began with aCommuist coup in 1978 looks as uncertain as the future after Feb.15, the deadline for the Soviets to end their role in a war theyjoined nine years ago.   Departing Soviet military forces leave behind a regimestockpiling ammunition for a battle of survival with the guerrillas,who ring the capital in mountain bases and have rejected proposalsfor a political settlement.   Kabul's daily life is a tableau of war, suffering, fear andefforts to escape. Amputees hobble in the potholed sreets. Longlines wait for visas at the Indian Embassy.   The U.S. Embassy shut its visa section last month after a delugeof more than 250 applications a day, compared with five a month lastyear.   Food and fuel are scarce because of guerrilla attacks on convoysalong the Salang, making the bitter weather even harder to bear. Thehighway connects Kabul to the Soviet border, carrying Red Armysoldiers home and supply convoys south toward the capital.   Giant Ilyushin 76 transports drop cascades of anti-missile flaresas they climb from the Kabul airport, bound for Moscow with soldiersand civilian advisers after delivering cargoes of ammunition.   An average of six planes arrive and depart daily. Hundreds offully equipped Soviet troops have been seen boarding them.   Incoming road convoys roar down the Salang with ammunition aswell as food and fuel.   North of the Salang Pass toward the border, Soviet troops aredigging in at new positions, diplomats say, apparently to secure theroad for the final withdrawal.   Workmen in Kabul are felling an avenue of trees and leveling theground on either side of a long, wide road that runs from theDarulaman Palace, headquarters of the Defense Ministry, past theSoviet Embassy.   It is wide enough to accommodate smaller Antonov transports andthere is speculation the Soviets are preparing an emergency airstrip.   Indications are that thousands of Afghans, including supportersor beneficiaries of the current regime, are trying to slip away ormake arrangements for quick exits.   Since the U.S. Embassy stopped issuing visas, lines form outsidethe embassy of India, the nearest country for those who can affordair fare.   Most embassies, down to skeleton staffs with families alreadyevacuated, have contingency plans to close. The U.S. Embassy has 11American staff members left and says the question of whether to stayis ``under constant review.''   U.N. aid agencies have instructions from headquarters in New Yorkto withdraw 20 foreign staff by the end of January, leaving justeight.   The West German Foreign Ministry on Saturday confirmed that ithad ordered its diplomats to leave Kabul.   Fur-hatted Soviet troops still man mountainside artilleryemplacements on Kabul's outskirts but have handed over some posts onthe perimeter road.   Rumors abound, including one that Soviets are about to move partof their military headquarters from Kabul to Mazar-e-Sharaf. Thatcity is near the Soviet border and, more importantly, on the otherside of the daunting Hindu Kush mountain range.   Some analysts believe the guerrillas, who have reduced rocketattacks on the capital, are holding off a major assault to let theSoviets out.   President Najib fills his public pronouncements with a blend ofexhortations to fight on and urgings that the guerrillas resumetalks with Kremlin representatives on a political solution.   ``We will forge ahead and struggle,'' he told a recent gatheringto mark the ninth anniversary of the feared Ministry of StateSecurity.   An estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers were in Afghanistan whenwithdrawal began May 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed inGeneva. Half were gone by Aug. 15 and Feb. 15 is the deadline forall to be withdrawn.</TEXT></DOC>
