Merrill Lynch also announced a major accounting change in itsemployee retirement program that will free $220 million in excesspension funds that have accumulated over the past few years andreturn the money to the company.   Executives briefing reporters about the pension plan change saidthe 32,700 employees affected would continue to receive equivalentbenefits under the new arrangement and would be able to participatein a stock ownership plan that takes effect next year.   Courtney Jones, chief financial officer, said the company woulduse the $220 million surplus for various purposes but did notelaborate. He said the change would be reflected in fourth-quarterearnings results but did not estimate them.   Third-quarter earnings totaled $65.6 million or 58 cents a sharefor the three months ended Sept. 30, vs. $195.1 million or $1.78 ashare in the equivalent period a year earlier, the company said inan earnings statement.   Total revenues in the third quarter totaled $2.79 billion vs.$2.66 billion, a 4.8 percent increase. But commission revenuestumbled 33.9 percent.   The results partly reflected a severe decline in investor demandfor stocks in the aftermath of the October 1987 market crash, whichhas devastated stock trading volumes and brokerage commissions ofmany Wall Street investment firms.   Merrill Lynch said in its earnings statement that the decline inthird-quarter results also reflected an extraordinary $100.3million after-tax gain in the comparable 1987 quarter, when thecompany sold a partnership interest in its Manhattan headquarters.   While the results were sharply lower, they were fairlyconsistent with the 60 percent average drop in third-quarterearnings that the securities industry has been experiencing.   Daniel P. Tully, Merrill Lynch president and chief operatingofficer, called the results ``positive in an environment marked byan industry-wide decline in activity, particularly among individualinvestors.''   Other Merrill Lynch officials said the company's effort over thepast several years to diversify into other areas, such asinvestment banking, bond trading and corporate takeover financing,had helped defray the impact of the stock market slump.   For the first nine months of the year, Merrill Lynch earningstotaled $187 million or $1.67 a share, a 51.7 percent drop from the$387 million or $3.52 a share earned in the first nine months of1987.   Revenue for the nine months totaled $7.68 billion vs. $7.50billion, a 2.3 percent increase. But commission revenue fell 33.8percent.   Merrill Lynch is one of the largest U.S. investment andfinancial services firms, with capital of $3 billion and more than500 offices worldwide.</TEXT></DOC>
