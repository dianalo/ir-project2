Normally this exchange is in balance, and the mineralcontent remains relatively constant. This balance may be disturbed asa result of certain metabolic and endocrinologic disorders. The termdystrophy, referring to a disturbance of nutrition, is applied to metabolicand endocrine bone diseases and should be distinguished from the termdysplasia, referring to a disturbance of bone growth. The two terms areeasily confused but are not interchangeable. Metabolic bone disease iscaused by endocrine imbalance, vitamin deficiency or excess, and otherdisturbances in bone metabolism leading to osteoporosis and osteomalacia.</TEXT></DOC>
