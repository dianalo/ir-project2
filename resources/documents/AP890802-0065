Bush is theAmerican League pennant chase.   Bush _ oilman, baseball team owner and president's eldest son _declared Tuesday he would not run for governor of Texas next year.   ``I have had time to think and sort things out, and at thistime, I am not a candidate for governor in 1990,'' Bush said in aspeech to lawyers.   ``For now I want to focus my obligations to the Texas Rangersbaseball team and more importantly on my responsibilities as afather and as a provider,'' he said.   Bush is managing partner of the Rangers, who are battling forthe American League West division title.   Bush said he knows better than to ``never say never,'' but hefelt very little could change his mind about not running in 1990.   ``I think that's a very honest and forthright statement,'' saidFred Meyer, state GOP chairman. ``I do believe at some point he'sgoing to be a factor on the political scene because I think hehandles himself very well.''   Since returning to Texas last year after helping his father'spresidential campaign, the 43-year-old Bush has been widely viewedas a likely candidate for governor.   Republican Gov. Bill Clements has said he will not seekre-election.</TEXT></DOC>
