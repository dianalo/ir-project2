Wolverine said it paid $12.88 each, or about $5.6 million, for the shares, owned by Mallcap Corp. of Australia and Blue Mountain Properties N.V. A Wolverine spokesman said the company recently heard of Blue Mountain and had no details about it since Wolverine is buying the shares through a broker. Before the purchase, Wolverine had an estimated 7.1 million shares outstanding.    The spokesman said a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last year said the shares were held by Mallcap and Austexport Properties Ltd. of Australia. In the filing, the two companies said they were acting jointly in their investment.    Wolverine said a third party, which it wouldn't name, purchased an additional 300,000 Wolverine shares from Mallcap and Blue Mountain. The two transactions left Mallcap and Blue Mountain with combined holdings of 1.5% of Wolverine's shares outstanding, Wolverine said.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Wolverine closed at $12.25 a share, up 25 cents.    The spokesman said the two companies had offered to sell Wolverine the shares. He said that despite the fact Wolverine paid the companies above the current market price for the shares, the company thinks the payment was &quot;reasonable.&quot; He said any attempt by Wolverine to buy a similarly large block of its stock in the open market probably would have driven the price up, and increased its expenditure.    Thomas D. Gleason, Wolverine's chief executive officer, said the purchase fits company efforts to maximize long-term shareholder value. The company, best known as the maker of Hush Puppies, said the stock purchase will increase its total debt to capitalization ratio to 29% from 25%. Wolverine financed the purchase with bank borrowings, which it plans to replace with more permanent financing.    Because of the purchase, Wolverine said it was ending a previously announced stock-repurchase program. Under the program, Wolverine planned to buy as many as 350,000 shares of its common stock. It had bought 91,000 shares to date. </TEXT></DOC>
