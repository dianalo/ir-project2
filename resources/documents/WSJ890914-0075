An asset sale was expected. Imperial previously agreed to offer for sale C$550 million of oil and gas properties as part of its agreement with Canadian investment authorities in its $4.15 billion acquisition of Texaco Canada Inc.    Imperial, which is 70% owned by Exxon Corp., said it would use proceeds to reduce debt raised to finance the Texaco Canada purchase. The company said the properties up for sale represent about 5% of its proved reserves.    Denis Mote, an analyst with Maison Placement Canada Inc. in Toronto, said the properties are &quot;worth about C$800 million depending on the quality of the reserves.&quot; An Imperial spokeswoman declined to put a value on the properties.    The properties include interests in the Swan Hills, Mitsue, Nipisi, Utikuma and Waterton fields of Alberta. Proved reserves before royalties amount to about 115 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and about 300 billion cubic feet of natural gas.    In 1988, the average daily gross production of crude oil and natural gas liquids from the properties was 26,000 barrels and 50 million cubic feet of natural gas. Imperial said production from the properties in 1988 made up about 7% of the average daily gross production of crude oil and about 9% of gross production of natural gas of the combined average daily production of Imperial and Texaco Canada. </TEXT></DOC>
