More than 7,500 Syrian troops and about 500 tanks and armoredvehicles massed around the labyrinthine slums, where 18 Westernhostages, including nine Americans, are believed held by factionslinked to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.   The Syrian troops include two battalions of elite Special Forcescommandoes, Syrian and Lebanese military sources said.   Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, Syria's military intelligence commanderin Lebanon, told the pro-Syrian Amal militia and Hezbollah to laydown their arms.   Asked when the Syrians would make their move into the16-square-mile warren of narrow alleyways and cement-block houses,Kenaan said: ``This is our decision. We'll decide the rightmoment.''   He warned: ``Our forces will shoot without hesitation any gunmanon the street or in buildings.''   As Syrian troops surrounded the slums, dozens of families wereseen fleeing in convoys of bullet-scarred cars, packed with clothesand blankets.   Since intense fighting broke out May 6 between Amal andHezbollah, police say most of the slum's 250,000 residents havefled. At least 211 people have been killed and 586 wounded.   Lebanon's Interior Minister, Abdulla Rassi, told The AssociatedPress that the Syrians ``are going to enter the suburbs in a day ortwo, but I'm not setting deadlines.''   Hezbollah's spiritual guide, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,branded Syria's military buildup ``an act of intimidation.''   He said ``all the suburbs will be destroyed if the Syriansattempt to enter by force,'' indicating that Hezbollah, which hasfielded around 3,000 hard-core fighters, would resist the Syrians.   Shell blasts echoed across the capital as Kenaan spoke at a newsconference in west Beirut.   Police said Hezbollah and Amal militiamen were locked inartillery duels, but they had no reports of overall casualties.   In one incident, police said a shell hit the fourth floor of a10-story building crowded with Palestinians in west Beirut'sSanayeh district, killing a baby and two adults and wounding fourother people.   ``It was imperative for Syria to take the decision to rescue thepeople from this bloodbath,'' Kenaan declared.   ``So orders have been issued to the Syrian Arab forces to enterthe southern suburbs and enforce security in the enclave.''   He added: ``We call on the gunmen in the suburbs to lay downtheir arms ... and warn them, without exception, of theconsequences of firing a single bullet at our forces.''   Kenaan cut off a reporter who asked whether the Syrians wouldseek to free the foreign hostages. ``There is a disaster in thearea. People are suffering distress that we will try to end,'' hesaid, without elaboration.   The Syrian decision to commit its troops into what coulddeteriorate into house-to-house fighting underlined the failure ofAmal, the Syrians' strongest Lebanese ally, to crush Hezbollah.   Hezbollah's fighters have seized control of the slums in 10 daysof savage fighting with Amal, which is led by Justice MinisterNabih Berri.   When the fighting began, Hezbollah held about one-third of thedistrict that borders Beirut airport.   Kenaan declined to say whether the Syrian decision to move intothe slums was taken in coordination with Iran.   Syria is Iran's main Arab ally in the 7{-year-old gulf waragainst Iraq.   But that alliance, which is increasingly crucial to Iran after astring of military setbacks and growing political isolation, hascome under strain in recent months.   Syria considers neighboring Lebanon its sphere of influence. Ithas been alarmed by Hezbollah's drive, with Tehran's blessing andfinancing, to dominate Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the largestsingle sect in the country.   The Syrians moved 25,000 troops into north and east Lebanonunder a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.   They also deployed 7,500 troops in west Beirut in February 1987in an effort to end three years of militia anarchy. But, despitebombings and kidnappings, they have not until now sought to moveinto south Beirut.   The Christian-run Voice of Lebanon radio said, without naming asource, that the hostages are now held in the basement of theIranian embassy in a seaside neighborhood outside the battle zone.   ``This report is untrue. It's absolutely baseless,'' an embassyspokesman said. He declined to be named.   The weekly Ash-Shiraa magazine reported earlier that thecaptives were moved during the fighting from an exposed Hezbollahbarracks to the home of Hezbollah spokesman Sheik Ibrahim al-Aminin the less vulnerable Haret Hreik neighborhood. The report couldnot be verified.   Police said most of the 250,000 people who lived in the slums,mostly poor Shiites, have fled since the fighting erupted.</TEXT></DOC>
