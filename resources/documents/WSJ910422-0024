If these multibillion-dollar investors follow through onplans to gradually increase their holdings of small stocks,they could nourish the rally that has propelled the NasdaqComposite Index to a 54% gain from its mid-October low.</LP><TEXT>   Footprints of big investors can be found in blocks of10,000 or more shares. These show that since early December,institutions have poured more than $2 billion intoover-the-counter stocks, says Laszlo Birinyi, head of a stockresearch firm bearing his name. Most of that money, he says,has come from mutual funds, the stronghold of smallinvestors.   But now there are also signs of increasing interest fromthe pension-fund behemoths. No longer are they quick todismiss small stocks as a flyspeck in their portfolios, toodifficult to trade and too tiny to affect overall returns.   Big institutions &quot;don't need small-cap stocks, but we'rekind of intrigued that you can kind of get a little extrakicker on your portfolio&quot; with them, says Roland M. Machold,director of New Jersey's $32 billion public-employee pensionfund. With $12 billion in equity holdings, the New Jerseyfund has bet a $40 million sliver on small stocks sinceNovember, and expects to reach $100 million by year end.   More institutional investors are hunting for small-stockmanagers. Callan Associates Inc. of San Francisco, forexample, has launched 11 searches to match clients withsmall-stock money managers so far this year, compared withonly four such searches for all of 1990. And the small-stockcategory accounted for 14% of announced searches for alltypes of stock managers last year, according to consultantsEager andamp; Associates, Louisville, Ky. That was about the samepercentage as in 1989, but up sharply from 3% in themid-1980s.   Even more telling, to Mr. Birinyi, is that big investorswere willing to back OTC stocks by pouring in nearly $600million even as the stocks sagged in the month before thePersian Gulf war began in January. &quot;The investor buying astock that is going down is forecasting a long-term, positiverally,&quot; he says. In the first quarter, he adds, money flowinginto OTC stocks from all sources boosted the total value ofNasdaq stocks nearly 7% to $403 billion, compared with a 2%rise in New York Stock Exchange issues to $3.2 trillion.   Veteran money managers such as Dreman Value ManagementInc. and Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. are adding small-stockinvestment products. Bernstein hired five new analysts in thepast two years solely to do research on small stocks, saysRichard Pzena, who two years ago stopped covering big oilcompanies to start up the firm's small-stock value fund.Bernstein is about to offer the fund to institutionalclients; it rose 33% this year during a test run.   Florida's $23 billion public-employee pension fund haslong held small stocks. &quot;They were the worst thing to havefor a number of years,&quot; says Cliff Hinkle, the fund'sexecutive director. Now, &quot;it's paying off . . .Fundamentally, it makes sense to have stocks that have anextraordinary ability to grow.&quot; At the moment, Mr. Hinklewould like small-cap stocks &quot;better if they were cheaper,&quot;but he says, &quot;there are still values in that sector.&quot;   Idaho Power Co. also is benefiting from the recent run-upin small-stock prices, having invested $10 million throughProvident Investment Counsel in Pasadena, Calif., more than ayear ago. While many mangers were hit with losses last year,Provident eked out a gain, then posted a 27% rise for thisyear's first quarter.   &quot;We got lucky,&quot; says Ronald Meyers, administrator forIdaho Power's $122 million pension fund. Investing in smallstocks, he adds, &quot;is not for the faint of heart, even with agreat manager. {But} for a small portion of the portfolio,the growth opportunities are very attractive.&quot;   Big buyers can easily upset the market, driving up pricesfor shares they want. The New Jersey fund has slowed itspurchases to no more than $100,000 or $200,000 in some weeks,instead of the $2 million in shares it had originally thoughtit would buy. &quot;We just decided to be patient,&quot; says Mr.Machold. He thinks other big institutions also are beingcautious about not causing run-ups in small stocks with theirpurchases.   Small stocks will inevitably stumble, cautions GordonFines, who manages small-stock investment for institutionalclients of IDS Financial Services Inc. of Minneapolis. &quot;Wewill have a correction at some point and it will be painful,&quot;he says, &quot;but then I think there will be a fair amount ofbuying. What's been set into motion is a longer-term theme.&quot;   Among Mr. Fine's holdings are retailer Duty FreeInternational Inc. of Ridgefield, Conn.; Cisco Systems Inc.,a Menlo Park, Calif., maker of computer peripheral equipment;Sensormatic Electronics Corp., a maker of surveillanceequipment based in Deerfield, Fla.; and Applied BioscienceInternational Inc., an East Millstone, N.J., medical productsconcern.   Fears of a stock-price dive are keeping some institutionsat bay, says Thomas Larsen, who manages $350 million of smallstocks for Chancellor Capital Management, overseer of a totalof $5 billion in stocks. The &quot;cash on the sidelines,&quot; hesays, is &quot;just more potential gas on the fire&quot; when the biginvestors start buying.   At Dreman Value Management, David Dreman says less than$30 million of the firm's $4 billion under management isinvested in small stocks. Mr. Dreman thinks that number willgrow, but he's treading lightly in the small end of themarket, saying, &quot;I'm frightened by the overheated parts ofit.&quot;   With prices for some biotechnology, health-care andcomputer shares at dizzying levels, Chancellor's Mr. Larsenexpects a reviving economy to prompt investors to switch intocapital goods, energy service and consumer stocks. He'sputting bets on restaurateur Cracker Barrel Old Country StoreInc. of Lebanon, Tenn.; Duriron Co. of Dayton, Ohio, a heavymachinery company; and machine-tool maker Giddings andamp; LewisInc. of Fond du Lac, Wis. He also likes Sierra On-Line Inc.,an entertainment software company based in Coarsegold, Calif.   Of course, such bets may be peanuts for a mammothinstitutional investor. At the New Jersey pension fund, allthe small-stock holdings combined don't amount to the $150million to $200 million routinely invested in a single BigBoard stock.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks fell sharply as investorscontinued to cash in some of their recent gains.
