While Mr. Popoff wouldn't specifically estimate profit for the quarter, he said it would exceed first-quarter profit of $2.67 a share and implied that the company expects it to be around $3 a share.    &quot;The analysts are asking will we be over $3 (a share) or under $3 in the second quarter and I don't know which way to answer,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;I don't feel any less secure above or below $3.&quot;    If profit does reach $3 a share, that would be the highest net income Dow Chemical has ever posted in one quarter. Sales of more than $4 billion would also be a record. In the year-earlier second quarter, Dow Chemical had profit of $312 million, or $1.62 a share, on sales of $3.41 billion.    Separately, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. raised Dow Chemical's debt ratings, saying it is convinced the chemical maker's acquisition strategy won't overly strain its cash flow.    The agency said nearly $4 billion of debt was involved in its ratings change. Its action included raising Dow Chemical's senior debt rating to single-A from single-A-minus; its commercial paper to A-1 from A-2; and the senior Eurodebt of its Dow Chemical Overseas Capital N.V. finance unit to single-A from single-A-minus.    Sandamp;P also removed the debt from its CreditWatch list, where it was placed Feb. 8 with positive implications. At the time Sandamp;P was considering raising the company's debt ratings but still worried that Dow Chemical might adopt aggressive acquisition tactics and that the cyclicality of its basic chemicals business might imperil the company's ability to finance those moves. The ratings service was reacting, in part, to Dow's unsuccessful bid last year to buy A.H. Robins Co.'s flagship consumer brands for $950 million, said Michael Kaplan, a vice president at Sandamp;P.    Yesterday, however, Sandamp;P said it now believed the company's continued strong earnings, among other things, would prevent a cash flow pinch. Mr. Kaplan added that Dow Chemical's prices were holding firm and that demand was likely to continue strong for the company's commodity chemicals, factors which contributed to the debt upgrade. Moreover, Mr. Kaplan noted that Dow Chemical has cushioned itself against cyclical downturns in its basic chemicals business by expanding its household goods and pharmaceuticals operations in recent years.    He added that, &quot;in speaking with management, we became satisfied&quot; the company's approach to acquisitions wouldn't overly tax its cash flow.    Dow Chemical's stock closed in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday at $82.75 a share, up $1.25.    Mr. Popoff said earlier that he was generally comfortable with analysts' estimates that Dow Chemical will earn around a record $10 a share for the year, assuming there isn't a drastic worsening in the economy. That would compare with profit of $1.24 billion, or $6.47 a share, last year, a record for the company.    Mr. Popoff also said sales in 1988 could be &quot;approaching&quot; $16 billion, up from last year's record $13.38 billion.    Dow Chemical, like the rest of the industry, has been benefiting from a boom in demand for basic chemicals and from newly constrained capacity world-wide. During the past several years, the industry as a whole has been eliminating excess capacity by closing plants and delaying construction of new facilities.    Mr. Popoff said these factors, as well as stabilized raw materials costs, are continuing to help Dow Chemical's business this year. He said the company's prices will rise about 7% to 8% this year from last year, with much of that increase already having taken place in the first quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
