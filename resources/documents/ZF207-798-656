 A recent survey of 3,500 computersecurity professionals by the National Center for Computer Crime Data (NCCCD)in Los Angeles estimates the annual losses from computer abuse, nationally,at $555,464,000.andP;  Of the survey respondents, the average installationexperienced losses of $109,000,365 person hours and 26 hours of computertime.andM;The survey also detailed nine types of computer crime--money theft,information theft, damage to software, malicious data alteration, deceptivedata alteration, theft of services, harassment, extortion and damage tohardware.andP;  Telephone services were the most common service theft, withcomputer services constituting much of the remainder.andP;  Theft of servicesexperienced the biggest jump in occurrence--24%--from the previous survey.andM;Nevertheless, there are as many avenues of thwarting computer crime as thereare types of computer crimes.andP;  In determining which way to go, it is mosthelpful to consider some of the standards and practices in use among othercomputer professionals.andM;Donn Parker, a leading computer security consultant at SRI International inMenlo Park, Calif., studied the practices of a city, a county and a statedata-processing service organization; a criminal justice research institute;a large insurance company; and two university data-processing centers.andP;  Hedevised a set of generally used controls that should be present in everywell-run computer center (see table, &quot;The Well-Secured Computer Center&quot;).andO;They were detailed in Computer Security Techniques, a 1982 publication of theU.S.andP;  Department of Justice Bureau of Criminal Justice Statistics.andM;Top Management CommitmentandM;Though it was written seven years ago, Parker says the categories of baselinepractices haven't changed, but 50 or 60 new practices have been added.andP;  Thesepractices include the separation of duties, such as prohibiting applicationdevelopers from administering the application; the &quot;aging&quot; of trash, where afirm holds onto its trash for 24 or 48 hours so nothing important is thrownout; and using daily code words for voice communications systems.andP;  One bank,which was aging its trash, was able to rescue $12 million worth ofunprocessed checks that had been thrown out.andP;  Managers who choose not toimplement these types of controls, Parker adds, will have to justify theiraction if challenged by upper management over a system failure.andM;The computer security professionals responding to NCCCD's survey, &quot;Commitmentto Security,&quot; ranked top management commitment to security the most importantand valuable component of a general security strategy.andM;David Johnson, a lawyer with Washington D.C.-based Wilmer, Cutler andamp; Pickeringand author of a white paper on the legal issues involved with computerviruses, concurs with NCCCD's assessment.andP;  He recommends that corporationsand other institutions consider security issues thoughtfully at their highestpolicy levels and adopt a set of preventive measures.andP;  These includeenforceable policies for employee or student use and an emergency action planthat will minimize damage.andM;Security GuidelinesandM;Other components of a security strategy, ranked in order of importance byNCCCD's survey respondents, are establishing corporate ethical norms forcomputer use, maintaining employee awareness and training, enforcing computercrime laws, securing communications and electromagnetic emanations andcontrolling physical access.andM;IS managers may find other complementary ideas for securing their systems inthe security guidelines and standards developed by the National Institute forScience and Technology (NIST), formerly the National Bureau of Standards.andO;These are among the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), whichthe agency issues in all areas of computer use.andM;Steward Katzke, chief of the Computer Security Division at NIST, describesthe FIPS as &quot;good practices.&quot;andP;  &quot;If neither they nor a comparable alternativeare used,&quot; he adds, &quot;it will be up to the user to explain why not.&quot;andM;Under the Computer Security Act of 1987, government users with &quot;sensitive&quot;information in their computers have no choice but to develop a computersecurity plan and to submit it to NIST.andP;  The express goal of the act is toensure that agencies move toward more standardized government computersecurity practices.andP;  As of March 1989 NIST had received about 1,500 plans.andO;Next, the agencies will have to implement the plans and train their personnelin computer security.andM;The NCCCD survey responses also show that security professionals areconstantly changing the types of technologies they use to fend off any cracksin system security (see chart, &quot;Technology Safeguards Against Crime&quot;).andP;  Useof mainframe and minicomputer access controls, for example, rose to 85% in1988 from 61% in 1985, but is expected to drop 10% by 1991.andM;In contrast, many other technologies and products, including smart cards,advanced encryption, intrusion detection expert systems, secure networks andantivirus products will be much more widely used in 1991 than in 1988.andM;Consequences of InactionandM;Stan Stahl, the center's director of research, says: &quot;The results of oursurvey demonstrate what others are doing to protect against various types ofcomputer security violations.andP;  There is no escaping the need to keep abreastof other managers' practices, particularly those with similar vulnerabilitiesor in the same industry.&quot;andM;Attorney Johnson adds, &quot;An institution that doesn't take the computer crimethreat seriously and consider reasonable policies to reduce its risk willface a higher risk of litigation and be less well able to answer a claim thatthe institution had not acted responsibly to avoid the risk.&quot;andM;J.J.andP;
