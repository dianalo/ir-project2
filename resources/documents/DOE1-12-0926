A statistical computeranalysis of the contribution of each of the three tests, and in combination,to the final diagnoses of hypothyroid, euthyroid, and hyper thyroid stateswas designed. The best contributing test for hypothyroidism and euthyroidismwas TSH-RIA (98.5 and 93%, respectively). T4/T3+TSH-RIAs were the optimaldual combination for diagnosing euthyroidism (98.0%). For diagnosinghyperthyroidism T4-RIA was the best single test (82.5%) followed by T3+ T4 as an optimal dual combination (95%). Using all three tests wasof no significant additional value over dual combinations. It is concludedthat the work and cost of randomly performing three tests routinely isnot justified without clinical basis. An algorithm is proposed to guidethyroid studies based on computer analyses of the above-mentioned singleor dual-test combinations to establish accurate diagnosis at the lowestlaboratory cost.</TEXT></DOC>
