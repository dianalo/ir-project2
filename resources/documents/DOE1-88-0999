Because of the rapid attenuation of the carbon xrays, cellular dimensions at the time of exposure were measured usingoptical and electron microscopy, and frequency distributions of meandose absorbed by the cell nucleus were obtained. The results indicatethat the differences in cell killing between ultra-soft and hard x raysmay depend on the nuclear thickness of the cells. Studies of the effectsof hypoxia on V79 and 10T1/2 cells using carbon K, aluminum K (1.5 keV),and copper K x rays show decreasing OER values with decreasing x-rayenergy and no difference between the two cell lines. Age response studieswith V79 cells show similar cell-cycle variation of survival for carbonK and aluminum K x rays as for hard x rays.</TEXT></DOC>
