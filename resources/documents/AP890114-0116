Newly elected U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, Mayor Xavier Suarez and U.S.Rep. E. Clay Shaw visited the Bobby Maduro Miami Stadium to examinethe problems facing the growing number of Nicaraguan arrivals. Atotal of 263 Nicaraguans are living at the stadium.   Shaw, a Republican congressman from Fort Lauderdale, pledged hisefforts in Washington ``so that Miami won't have to take on alonethe financial burden of these new refugee arrivals.''   ``The reality is that those (federal) funds don't come easily''to help find jobs and homes for immigrants streaming across theTexas border from Mexico and seeking political asylum, said Mack, aRepublican from Cape Coral.   ``But it is important that we understand a lot must be done tofind a solution to the problem,'' Mack said through Suarez, whoacted as an interpreter.   Miami officials are worried that the latest wave of Nicaraguanspouring into the city will overburden facilities like schools andhospitals.   The Central Americans began arriving from southern Texas by thebusload Thursday and Friday, following a federal judge's ruling thatthe government could not keep them there while their applicationsfor political asylum were being processed.   The Nicaraguans maintain that they are fleeing oppression bytheir country's leftist Sandinista government. The Immigration andNaturalization Service says the immigrants are not eligible forasylum if they actually are fleeing bad economic conditions in theirhomeland, which has been hurt by a U.S. trade embargo.   Since the judge's decision Monday, about 400 people have comehere, bringing the two-month total to about 2,000, most of themNicaraguans. Officials expect about 100,000 more to make their wayto this heavily Hispanic city during the next 18 months.   A delegation of community leaders visited southern Texas onFriday to warn those awaiting transportation to Miami.   ``They need to know that they're going to have to fend forthemselves,'' Tony Ojeda, and assistant county manager from DadeCounty, said in Harlingen, Texas.   Shaw recalled an earlier meeting he had in the Nicaraguan capitalof Managua with President Daniel Ortega.   ``He's ruining your country,'' Shaw said of the Sandinistaleader, ``and I pledge full support for the Contras.''   His call was met by cheers in Spanish to the effect of ``longlive democracy'' and ``communism out.''   Mack told the refugees he plans to speak with President-electBush about the refugees. He already had contacted Attorney GeneralRichard Thornburgh to help coordinate federal efforts, he said.   Huge piles of used clothing were gathered under a palm treeoutside the stadium, and a church group was distributing free orangedrinks and chili dogs to those in the shelter _ as well as to dozensmore camping outside the stadium who arrived after authoritiesdeclared the shelter full.   One refugee who arrived too late to get a cot under the bleacherswas Sergio Lezama, 54, of Managua. The lawyer said he has slept at afriend's house since his arrival.   ``I don't have a family here in Miami,'' he said, ``so I'm justwaiting here hoping for some place to live and some work.''   The refugees at the baseball stadium will be relocated to BeckhamHall, a county facility, before Jan. 25, when the Baltimore Oriolesbaseball team arrives for spring training, officials said.   ``We have something arranged with the county (for thoseaccommodations),'' Suarez said.</TEXT></DOC>
