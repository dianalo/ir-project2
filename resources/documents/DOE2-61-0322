In general figures, the machine costs (ex works)represent about 50% of the overall investment costs for small WECs and80% to 90% in case of large WECs. The operational costs range in theorder of 2,5% of the costs for hardware and infrastructure. Instead ofthe income -depending on the specific tariffs and tax laws - the generatingcosts are widely used. These can be calculated using the energy-specificinvestment costs of the diagram. The values have to be multiplied bythe assumed cost factor for the infrastructure and then by the annuitydue to the interest rate and economic lifetime.</TEXT></DOC>
