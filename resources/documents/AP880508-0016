(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Clarence ``Cap'' Cornish celebrated the70th anniversary of his first solo flight the same way he's markedthe occasion every year _ flying high.   The 89-year-old retired insurance executive took his wife, Lois,and daughter, Ruthanne Krieg, for a five-minute plane ride Friday.Through the years, Cornish hasn't missed a single May 6commemorative flight.   Flying was different when the man who eventually becameIndiana's first aeronautics commissioner first took to the air as a19-year-old.   ``There weren't any navigational aids at all then and no charts.I flew with a Rand McNally road map,'' said Cornish. ``Those werethe days before parachutes, too. If you made a serious error, youcould end up dead and embarrassed.''   Cornish served during World War I in the aviation section of theSignal Corps, the precursor of the U.S. Air Force. Cornish took hisfirst solo flight May 6, 1918, after just four hours and 20 minutesof instruction. He was then assigned to train other young airmen.   ``I didn't know anything about fighting Germans in the air andneither did my students,'' he said. ``It was the blind leading theblind.''   Cornish served for eight years as Indiana's first aeronauticscommissioner following World War II.</TEXT><DATELINE>CHADBOURN, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Everyone was so busy marching and judgingand eating strawberries that hardly anyone noticed the homemadeshortcake had taken a big splat and had to be replaced with thestore-bought variety.   Beauty queens and high school bands marched through this town of2,000 and judges tasted every variety of strawberry recipe as NorthCarolinians celebrated their 56th Strawberry Festival.   The weekend fair, billed as the state's oldest agriculturalfestival, drew hundreds of entries and thousands of spectators.   ``I don't think anybody has noticed that the cakes werestore-bought,'' said Jack Yates.   He was supposed to deliver 15 large sheet cakes baked by thewomen of his fraternal society, based in another town a few milesaway. But the cakes fell out of the back of the pickup.   Yates said he and a fellow lodge member ``heard something'' whena large truck passed them. ``We got out, went around and looked,and sure enough ... all the cake was in little pieces all over thehighway.''   They beat it to a local supermarket and bought up as much poundcake as they could find _ enough to make the approximately 1,500servings needed.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Theresa Earwood left VirginiaSpeciality Stores to pick up lunch for a co-worker, she didn't planto bring home a moral dilemma in the bag.   Inside was a game piece for a new giveaway being test-marketedby Wendy's in Virginia. Ms. Earwood opened the piece, thinkingBernadette Barber would never notice.   It was an instant $5,000 winner.   Morals came out on top, and Ms. Earwood, 26, decided to slip thepiece back in the bag and forget about it.   ``I would have had to live with it for the rest of my life,''she said.   Ms. Barber, 39, found the open game piece in her lunch Thursday,but didn't realize she had won until a few hours later. ``Then whenI did, I cried.''   Mike Fields, district manager for Wendy's International inVirginia Beach, said the company had to wait for independentverification that Ms. Barber's game piece was a winner, whichshould take about a week.   After she pays taxes on the prize, Ms. Barber said she plans topick up some ``odds and ends.''   She said she does not plan to split the money with Ms. Earwood,but will give her some kind of reward.   ``It's a hard decision,'' she said. ``What would you do?''</TEXT><DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It was with some trepidation that PatBagley, cartoonist for The Salt Lake Tribune, opened the packagefrom retiring Salt Lake City Police Chief E. L. ``Bud'' Willoughby.   After all, Bagley had lampooned the chief more than once aboutthe day in 1980 when Willoughby popped a trash can over his headand gingerly carried a what looked like a bomb out of a bank. The``bomb'' turned out to be a bundle of highway flares.   The moment was captured on film and published in the newspaper,and there are those who believe to this day that Willoughbysecretly wished he could have crawled underneath that can andstayed there until the cameras were gone.   So it wasn't surprising that Bagley took cover beneath his owntrash can and cautiously peeled away the tape on the cardboard box.   The precautions were unnecessary. So were Bagley's concerns thatmaybe Willoughby didn't like him so well.   The box contained one of Willoughby's prized possessions _ theofficial Salt Lake City Bomb Squad ``helmet'' given him bythoughtful patrolmen after the bank incident.   It's a gunmetal gray trash can, resplendent with official SaltLake City Police patches, visor and a peephole.</TEXT></DOC>
