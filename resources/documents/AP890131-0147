The meeting also was told that the Central Committee will discussdemands for the ouster of national party chief Stipe Suvar, but thatthe 23-member Politburo, the most powerful party body, will make afinal decision.   Suvar took the floor to announce that if the Politburo decides torelieve him, ``I shall accept this only as a moral reprimand becausethe Central Committee alone can decide on an ideological-politicalmeasure,'' such as dismissing him.   His comments suggest there is disagreement even on the rules andprocedure for a possible dismissal.   The meeting of the policy-making Central Committee, which startedMonday, is marked by a rift between liberals and conservatives overways to overcome the country's worst economic and political crisis.   As opposing delegates clashed, two senior military officersissued dramatic warnings that the armed forces would not remain idleif the country's fortunes continue to decline.   ``One of the biggest barriers to the stabilization of thesituation in the country is the disunity of the leaderships on alllevels,'' said Vice Adm. Stane Brovet, the deputy defense minister.   ``Yugoslavia can survive only as a true federation, and theforces which are striving toward the breakup of such a Yugoslaviashould be prevented primarily by political, but also by all othermeans,'' Brovet said.   The military has remained on the sidelines of recent politicalconflicts between those favoring more democracy and politicalpluralism and those advocating a strong, centralized communistsystem to solve the country's problems.   Senior officers show signs of increasing unease over the crisis,which includes a 250 percent inflation rate, a sharp drop in livingstandards and an alarming increase in labor and ethnic unrest.   The political chief of the armed forces, Adm. Petar Simic, toldthe meeting Monday: ``What some describe as the battle forYugoslavia will not be waged without the Yugoslav army.''   Both military men have called for an end to the feuding.   But supporters of Slobodan Milosevic, the hard-line party chiefof the Serbian republic, continued attacks on Suvar, a Croat, andother non-Serbian federal officials whom they blame for Poland'sprotracted crisis.   Croatian Ivo Druzic sparked a sharp debate when he appealed toSuvar and Milosevic to reconcile their differences and compromise.   Druzic compared their clash to ``a train being pulled in oppositedirections by two locomotives.''   Milosevic rejected this assertion without indicating anywillingness to compromise.   Vukasin Micunovic, a Central Committee member from Montenegro,said, ``The intolerance shown at this meeting ... is a result of thestruggle for power'' under way in the party leadership.   Milosevic's supporters at the session criticized Suvar's openingspeech Monday, when he said the country faces a stark choice betweenmore democracy or ``neo-Stalinism.''   ``Yesterday's speech, without a trace of self-criticism ... doesnot offer answers to any of the key questions,'' said Serbian memberTomislav Radovic.   Milosevic is supported by Yugoslavia's poorer regions, which fearthat market-oriented economic reforms will cause layoffs atloss-making, state-subsidized enterprises.   Suvar is supported by Slovenia and his native Croatia, whichfavor increased political pluralism, more democracy and radicalmarket-oriented reforms.</TEXT></DOC>
