KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   CIA Director William Webster says Libyarecently experienced a serious toxic spill at chemical weaponsproduction facilities as the country rushes toward large-scalemanufacture of mustard gas and nerve agents.   Webster told the Senate Government Operations Committee onThursday that the spill occurred at Rabta, some 60 miles southwestof Tripoli, but he provided no other details.   He said that while such problems are expected to continue, Libyais on the verge of producing a chemical weapons capability far inexcess of any realistic military needs, posing the possibility suchweapons could be transferred to Middle East nations with past linksto terrorists.   Webster based his statements on intelligence estimates.   Webster said the Libyan facility is the largest single factorycomplex in the Third World capable of producing chemical weapons.Iraq's overall chemical weapons potential is thought to be largerstill, he said.   ``We are concerned that the plant's production capabilities far,far exceed what Libya could use for its own military purposes,''Webster said.   ``Therefore it becomes a potential brokering agent for othercountries,'' in the Middle East with links to groups which may havepast terrorist intentions, he said. He did not elaborate.   Webster said the Libyan chemical complex is linked to a nearbymetal fabrication facility ``equipped with the precision materialsto manufacture components for a variety of bombs and artillery.''   ``Other facilities are involved with filling and storing chemicalweapons,'' he said.   Repeating previous U.S. assertions, Webster said West Germancompanies have given Libya extensive assistance to assemble thechemical complex and provide materiel for it.   In a related development, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole ofKansas predicted a ``strong American reaction'' unless West Germanyquickly cracks down on companies helping Libya develop chemicalweapons and enacts tough domestic laws to control the export ofchemical weapons technology and material.   Dole said he delivered that message Thursday to WolfgangSchaeuble, chief of staff to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,during a meeting in his Capitol office.   ``West Germany is among our strongest allies and we can't affordto have this important issue _ on which we should share the sameview _ divide us,'' Dole said.   Dole is pressing for congressional passage of legislationimposing sanctions on foreign firms which help Libya and other ThirdWorld nations develop chemical weapons.   He said firms providing such assistance have been both wittingand unwitting about the ultimate nature of the Libyan facility.   Asked why a Western company would knowingly help Libya and otherThird World nations achieve a chemical warfare potential, Webstersaid: ``I can only surmise that greed is the explanation.''</TEXT></DOC>
