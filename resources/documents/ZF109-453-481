 Over the next year, you're going to be swept undera tsunami of rhetoric about the new class of &quot;slate PCs.&quot; That name may nothold--&quot;pen PCs&quot; is catchy, too--but by whatever name, these computers aregoing to draw a great deal of hype, breast-beating, and utter nonsense.andP;  Notonly in the computer press, but also in business, technology, and pop-sciencemagazines, and in the daily press.andM;That coverage will converge around two opposite and equally ill-informedviews: (1) these slate PCs are the greatest computers ever and will changehow we live and work; and (2) no, no, a thousand times no; they're a joke anda fraud.andM;No one ever said figuring out the PC market was easy, right?andM;Before that wave of media hysteria hits the beach, let's take a calm,intelligent look at these new machines: how they work, who constitutes theirintended market, and whether you're a likely buyer.andM;A lot of the confusion about this market-to-be arises because most of thesemachines can accept handwritten input.andP;  Using a stylus, the user writes on apad; the data is read, interpreted, and entered by the computer as a seriesof ASCII characters.andM;Handwriting recognition still hasn't reached the stage where we can scribbletypically sloppy handwriting and have the computer extract the alphabet fromour chicken scratch.andP;  So at least in the beginning, slate PC users will needto print block letters or discrete upper- and lowercase characters.andM;The focus on handwriting recognition, and its current limitations, fires upthe &quot;No, no, a thousand times no!&quot; anti-slate troops, who point out thatthese things are never going to replace regular PCs, including laptops, untilthey can turn scribbled, nearly illegible handwriting into clean input.andP;  Andeven with that, they add, slate PCs will never really replace keyboard-basedportables, since people aren't that afraid to type.andM;Which is where the great misunderstanding of slate PCs begins.andM;&quot;These things&quot; are not meant to replace standard PCs--desktops, laptops, orpalmtops, nor are they meant as keyboard substitutes for PC users who entertext and numbers, then manipulate that input in word processing, spreadsheet,and other mainstream business-PC functions.andM;THE WORKPLACE WITHOUT PCsandM;Slate PCs are after the other hemisphere of the workplace--those people whoaren't PC users today, and are likely never to be users of PCs in theirpresent form.andP;  These people don't sit at desks and write letters, draftreports, analyze pricing strategies, send out bagfuls of mail-merged letters,or add new records to shared databases.andM;Instead, they drive trucks, man loading docks, count inventory, put bread outon grocery shelves, deliver FedEx packages, fix the PCs at our desks, stockFritos racks, write traffic tickets, read electric meters, nurse us back tohealth, repair aircraft engines, take orders in the field, and perform 10,000other vital functions in our economy.andP;  Most but not all are blue-collarworkers; there are few &quot;gold-collar&quot; workers among them.andP;  They make anincredible contribution to our lives and to this country's economy.andM;They're not PC users now, and likely will never use even the slickestdesktops or laptops.andP;  Palmtops might be a possibility for them, but sincetheir use of a computer doesn't focus on keyboard entry, the space given tothe keyboard on palmtops--and the prevailing vision of palmtops as highlyminiaturized desktop PCs--make palmtops a poor fit for their needs.andM;When the naysayers on slate PCs finally stumble onto this fact, theirresponse is often like that of Emily Litella on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;: a longpause while the shock sets in, then &quot;Oh, never mind.andP;  &quot;andM;If the naysayers persist, very likely they launch into a closet-elitistwheeze about how these aren't real PCs after all, and how they don't knowthat much about the needs of Those People.andM;I embrace the idea of sweeping millions of nonoffice workers into the fold ofthose who use computers.andP;  It will enlarge their lives and their roles in mylife.andP;  And I wish both slate PCs and those they are built to serve got alittle more respect.andM;A CUSTOM FITandM;Slate PCs are perfect for highly customized software which relies on the userchecking off boxes, or calling up scrolling lists on-screen and then tappingthe right entries to select them.andP;  It's much faster and more accurate to pickitems from lists with stylus-taps than to remember and enter product codes.andO;To indicate quantities or dates, most slate PC users will simply tap theappropriate number from an appropriate range of digits shown on-screen.andM;There won't be much handwriting to recognize; what little alphanumeric inputis needed will hardly be burdensome.andM;ARDIS, the Advanced Radio Data Information Service assembled nationwide byMotorola and IBM, is the last step in tying these slate PCs into our widearea networks and information systems.andM;Sony, GRID, Go, and Momenta are leading the development of slate PCs andsoftware.andP;  Technical innovation will abound; most of these machines will runoperating systems other than DOS.andP;  (I hope they do, because otherwise how wesee their role and functions will be bounded by how we have learned to applyDOS machines in the office.)andM;Alvin Toffler, author of Future Shock, wrote years ago that in the comingThird Wave of technological change, some willandM;surf&quot; the Third Wave, adopting the new ways; while others, bound to the past,will be swept under.andP;  The slate PCs market will be a highly visible exampleof that principle at work.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
