S/370-series mainframe ingestsdata from automated wind towers at major NASA sites.andM;The automated stations routinely send out reports on wind condition, whichflight directors need to determine which runways are usable in case of alaunch abort, said Art Rasmussen, Mitre's technical project leader on theFlight Directors Weather Monitoring System.andM;Flight directors have to consider weather conditions at multiple sitessimultaneously because if the launch is aborted prematurely, the craft mighthave to land at an alternate site, Rasmussen said.andM;If there is an abort, &quot;We would have to be real concerned about the weatherat the other site.andP;  This system lets you monitor that,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;By pushingdifferent keys you can see on the display a layout of the runways at thesites and indicators that show where the towers are.&quot;andM;The IBM forwards the wind data to a Lynx 386 workstation at Johnson's WeatherOffice through a 9,6000-bit/sec serial link.andP;  Rasmussen's self-named Digesterprogram, written in C and located on the Weather Office's Lynx machine, sortsout the raw data and disposes of extraneous information, such as informationon visibility and barometric pressure.andM;The 386 workstation in the Weather Office transmits the remaining windinformation via Ethernet running TCP/IP to a second Lynx 386 workstationdedicated to the flight director.andP;  The flight director's 386 system furtheranalyzes the data and puts it in tabular form using a Mitre program writtenin C called the Flight Director Display.andM;A real-time environment was important to the project because the system mustprocess data continuously, Rasmussen said.andP;  &quot;We needed a systemthat can keepup with the cycle,&quot; he said.andM;Both C programs run on the Lynx operating system.andP;  Rasmussen said NASA choseLynx because basic Unix versions are not practical for real-time use.andP;  LynxOSis easier to work with than conventional Unix, he said.andP;  &quot;It looks likeBerkeley Unix, so I don't have to relearn the environment,&quot; he said.andM;Because it is a real-time system, it is more efficient and requires lessprocessing power so it can run more easily on a 386, he said.andM;NASA also chose LynxOS because of its future plans for the system.andP;  As NASAupgrades its system to add payload, navigation and other segments, it willneed powerful real-time power.andM;NASA plans to upgrade to Lynx's new line of RISC-based workstations when theybecome available later this year, Rasmussen said.andP;  &quot;We didn't need thecomputing horsepower for the first stage, which was the weather display.andO;When we get to handling real-time telemetry data from the shuttle, we will belooking for something 10 times as fast.&quot;andM;Before the new system was put into place, flight directors monitored weatherconditions by listening to weather forecasters at all possible landing siteson headphones.andP;  &quot;Everybody would be talking at once,&quot; Rasmussen said.andP;  At anygiven time, the flight director was probably listening to at least a dozenvoices, often creating misinterpretation and confusion.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
