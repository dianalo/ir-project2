(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman whose son was born addicted tococaine was charged Friday with child abuse and delivery of the drugto her baby, a felony drug charge prosecutors say has never beenused against a new mother.   Michael Hudson was born Nov. 13 addicted to cocaine and infectedwith syphilis. He has been treated and placed in a foster homeawaiting adoption.   His mother, Toni Suzette Hudson, 29, was arrested Thursday on astreet corner known for drug sales. She remained in custody in theSeminole County jail in lieu of $2,000 bond.   Other Florida prosecutors have charged mothers of addicted babieswith child abuse, but never with violating drug laws, said JeffDeen, Seminole-Brevard assistant state attorney.   Conviction of child abuse generally carries a sentence of no morethan 60 days. The drug charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 years.   Deen said he could prosecute Ms. Hudson for delivering the drugbecause state law defines it simply as a transfer from one person toanother. He plans to argue that the mother transferred the drug toMichael by ingesting it.   Ms. Hudson, who is unemployed and lives just east of AltamonteSprings, gave birth to Michael at Florida Hospital Altamonte, whereurine tests showed the infant and mother had cocaine in their bodies.   The hospital reported the case to the state Department of Healthand Rehabilitative Services as required by law when pregnant womenappear to be drug users.   HRS investigator Patsy Buckley interviewed Ms. Hudson four daysafter Michael was born, according to the arrest report. The motheradmitted using cocaine almost daily throughout her pregnancy, thereport says.   Ms. Hudson told investigators she had used cocaine for aboutthree years and even used the drug while in labor before enteringthe hospital.   ``Buckley advised that Hudson told her that she was not addictedto crack cocaine but tremendously enjoyed using crack cocaine, andit made her life worthwhile,'' the arrest report says.   Michael's cocaine addiction was sufficient evidence for Deen tosubpoena Ms. Hudson's hospital records, which showed cocaine in herbody. A pediatrics expert told investigators the only way a newborncould be addicted to cocaine would be if the mother used the drug.   Next week, authorities plan to arrest three more women on childabuse charges. The women being sought followed a similar pattern ofdrug abuse, sheriff's spokesman Roy Hughey said.</TEXT></DOC>
