ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The fledgling private American space launchindustry has signed 20 customers already and may have 10 more bythe end of the year, the Transportation Department says.   The first of the private launches, a communications satellitefor the government of India, is scheduled for launch next March byMcDonnell Douglas, according to a ``manifest,'' or list, releasedMonday by the department.   ``The manifest illustrates the significant success Americanlaunch firms have had in capturing the major share of the worldlaunch markets,'' said Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley.``American firms won 13 launch contracts last year compared to justtwo by the European consortium, Ariane.''   The commercial launchers will use federal facilities, mostly atCape Canaveral, Fla., and will reimburse the government for allcosts.   Burnley said the launch contracts will provide 8,000 jobs.   ``Eleven of the manifested payloads will be launched for foreigncustomers and will offset the U.S. balance of payments by as muchas $660 million,'' he said. ``The commercial launch sector may verywell be the most active part of America's non-military spaceprogram for the next several years.''   Eight of the satellites on the list previously had beenscheduled for launch from the space shuttle. Late in 1986, afterthe Challenger accident grounded shuttle flights, President Reaganfostered a private launch industry by ordering the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration out of the business.   The schedule announced by Burnley is subject to delays, not theleast of which may come because of a shortage of ammoniumperchlorate, a component of solid rocket fuel. One of the two U.S.plants that manufacture the fuel was destroyed in an explosion May4.   Burnley said allocation of the scarce fuel is being worked outamong NASA, the Defense Department and his agency and thatcommercial launch companies are looking for supplies frommanufacturers in Europe and Japan.   Two of the 20 missions are suborbital flights for gravityresearch, using light rockets. Seven flights are for the U.S.government, four are for international consortia, three are for theBritish and one each is for Indonesia, Japan, India and a Europeanconsortium.   McDonnell Douglas is launching eight of the cargoes, GeneralDynamics six and Martin Marietta four. A Maryland company, Conatec,is handling the light rocket launches.</TEXT></DOC>
