I loved that. I've read stories since I wasvery little. I grew up with storytelling.''   ``Eva Luna'' (Knopf, $18.95) takes place in a Latin Americancountry closely resembling Chile. The title character is orphanedas a child and grows up poor, working as a domestic. But she soondiscovers she can earn a living by telling stories.   ``I never realized it was something that I had and that I couldtrade for something else,'' Allende said. ``Like Eva Luna, Irealized when I was 40 that I had been trading stories for othergoods and making a living of it.''   Storytelling, the author explained, is a way of preservingmemory. Since leaving Chile after the 1973 military coup, she hasstruggled to remember the environment that shaped her as a child.   ``I realized about myself that I have lost something that wasinvisible, that I could not put in words,'' said Allende, whobecame a resident of Caracas, Venezuela. ``The only word I couldthink of was roots. It's memory.''   And what Allende misses goes beyond specific sights and sounds.Living in a foreign country, she struggles for a sense of identity.   ``If you walk in your own city, in your own country with yourpeople, you hear the language of your own country. You have thefeeling that somehow you know the subtle rules and you know how toget along.   ``When you're taken away from that, you don't belong anywhere.You're all by yourself, you have no roots and the memory of thepast starts fading away.''   So Allende uses her stories to keep the past alive.   ``I have the feeling I have lost my family, my country, myfriends, the accent of my own language,'' she said. ``But veryspecifically, the memory _ something that had been with menaturally. Now I'm reconstructing every day. Now it's finally mine,it's printed, portable. I can take it with me.''   Allende, whose father was a diplomat, was born in 1942 in Lima,Peru, but moved to Santiago, Chile, at the age of 3. She livedcomfortably as a child and was spared the poverty under which somany in her country lived.   ``I grew up in a world on contrasts _ extreme wealth and extremepoverty,'' she said. ``I belonged to the bubble. That means I'vebeen fortunate, but I was also aware of that inequality. Though Iwas always touched by that, I never came to terms with it until themilitary coup.''   She married an engineer when she was 19 and had two children.She supported the government of Salvador Allende, a Socialistelected president in 1970. (The author says she's a distantcousin). He was overthrown by the military in 1973 and executed.After Gen. Augusto Pinochet took over and declared a state ofemergency, he tortured and murdered political opponents andcensored the press.   Allende, a journalist at the time, recalled the day of the coup:``I left my house very early in the morning and I went to my job. Isaw only soldiers passing in tanks and airplanes and everybodyhiding in their homes. I saw the bombing of the (President's)palace. That very day, I had the feeling my whole life waschanging.''   She was an outspoken opponent of the regime and went into exilein 1975, leaving her family behind. They were later reunited.   ``When I learned I could be taken into prison with my childrenand have them tortured in front of me, it became unbearable. I hadto leave,'' she said.   Her first novel, ``House of the Spirits,'' was released in 1982and combined her strong political beliefs with ``magic realism,'' awriting style associated with such Latin American writers asGabriel Garcia Marquez.   ``You can not be an artist for the sake of art only in LatinAmerica,'' she said. ``I would say the same goes for any country inthe world where there is great repression and violence.''   Magic is also essential. Allende writes in Eva Luna:   ``I was writing a new episode every day, totally immersed in theworld. I was creating with the all-encompassing power of words,transformed into a multifaceted being, reproduced to infinity,seeing my own reflection in multiple mirrors, living countlesslives, speaking with many voices.''   And magic also is part of her roots: ``It's a combination oflegends, superstitions, myths. The Indian culture, the Africanculture. The dreams of the Spaniards who came here. The possibilityof finding Utopia.''   Allende's second novel, ``Of Love and Shadows,'' came out in1987, and had the same themes of good and evil, darkness and light,that appear in all her works.   She balances Eva Luna's passionate love affairs with theviolence and oppression of the outside world.   ``I think that I'm surrounded by violence, shadows, confusion,''the author said. ``Writing is maybe a naive attempt to make theworld more comprehensible, more tolerable.   ``Shadows for me are all those things that are threatening andhave always been there, are still there. Death, repression, abuse,inequality, mystery _ things in which I'm immersed, constantly.''   Allende is divorced from her first husband and recently marrieda San Francisco lawyer. With Chileans rejecting the presidency ofPinochet in a recent plebescite, she will visit the country inDecember.   ``I froze a country 15 years ago and took it with me,'' shesaid. ``When I go back, I won't know where I'll belong. Who will bemy friend when I go back?''   But no matter what, Allende will go on telling stories.   ``Eva Luna can not only trade the stories, she can make her lifebetter and others around her. She makes the world more tolerable.That's what I try to do all the time.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Nov. 11-13</NOTE></DOC>
