(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Park Service should lookbeyond park borders and adopt a regional approach to maintaining thenation's environmental legacy, according to a study commissioned bya non-profit conservation group.   The study, done for the National Parks and ConservationAssociation, also urged that funds for the park service be increasedas much as 10 percent and that park managers cooperate with stateand local groups to preserve the 80 million acres in national parks.   ``We have to give up the notion that park management stops atpark boundaries,'' said John C. Gordon, dean of Yale UniversitySchool of Forestry and Environmental Studies, who headed the panelof experts who made the recommendations.   ``If you have a grizzly bear range that stretches across twonational parks, six national forests, a state forest and 43 ranches,you must coordinate your efforts,'' he said. ``We can't solve allproblems simply by buying land.'' The group presented the studySunday to Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and National ParkService Director William P. Mott Jr. Park service spokesman GeorgeBerklacy said it ``will be given close scrutiny.''   ``We generally agree with the commission's conclusions, but it isa time of very tight budgets. Thus the commission's recommendationswill be weighed against those realities,'' he said.   Berklacy emphasized that the report was prepared by anindependent panel of experts. ``We are not bound by their findings,but we certainly will be guided by them,'' he said.   The 17-member panel examined policies at 49 national parks, inaddition to national monuments, historic sites, battlefields,seashores, recreation areas, the Statue of Liberty and the Alaskawilderness area.   ``The national parks are a uniquely American gift to the nationand the world,'' said Gordon, an authority on forest biology andforest management.   ``We now need a renewed commitment to the parks and a quantumleap forward in the level of research and management to safeguardthis irreplaceable heritage,'' he said.   Gordon said it is essential for the park service to educate thepublic about conservation. In addition, he said, the parks should beused to educate the public about toxic waste, deforestation, thegreenhouse effect and the extinction of plant and animal species.   He cited the National Park Service's handling of last year'sfires at Yellowstone National Park as an example of mismanagementwithin the agency. The fires affected nearly half of Yellowstone's2.2 million acres.   The park service has had a policy of allowing fires to burnnaturally so long as they don't threaten areas of human habitation.But Gordon said the agency should adopt ``ecosystem management,'' inwhich each area is considered individually.   For instance, he said, some park ecosystems should be allowed toburn naturally, but others should not; natural predators should bepermitted to control animal populations in some places but not inothers.   ``But what this nation should avoid is having all its eggs in onebasket by treating all ecosystems _ inside and outside the parks _alike,'' he said.   Gordon's panel pointed to the 1988 agreement involving the GreatSmoky Mountains National Park as a model for others to follow. TheGreat Smoky agreement calls for national, state and local agenciesto share data and cooperate in the management of natural andcultural resources throughout the southern Appalachian region.   Gordon's group also examined the so-called Leopold Report, namedafter a 1963 committee chaired by A. Starker Leopold. That reportput forth the idea of letting nature take its own course, unimpededby humans.   But Gordon said that as national parks face increasing pressures,it is important for the experts to intervene sometimes.   ``One of the big problems that still exists in the park serviceis that there is a desire to believe that by letting things aloneyou keep them from changing. Why people think that happens withnatural systems when they know it doesn't happen with thir own home,I don't know,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
