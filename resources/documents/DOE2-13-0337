Pure(andgt; 92%) 1-[/sup 18/F]fluoro-2-pyridone is obtained within 35 min fromend of bombardment in yields of up to 48%. Quality control consistedof HPLC combined with /sup 19/F-NMR spectroscopy. The mean specific activityof several preparations was 4 MBq/{mu}mol ({epsilon} = 16.6). The precursormay be used directly or purified by sublimation.</TEXT></DOC>
