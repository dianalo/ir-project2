That apathy ended, she said, when the Supreme Court agreed toreview a Missouri abortion dispute in which arguments will beconducted Wednesday.   At stake could be the continued vitality of the court's landmark1973 decision legalizing abortion.   The legal status of a fetus is not a key point in the Missouricase, just as so-called fetal rights were not a consideration inthe 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.   The court ruled then that a fetus, referred to as the``potentiality for human life,'' is not a person under theConstitution's 14th Amendment.   The amendment, ratified in 1868, says no state may ``deprive anyperson of life, liberty or property without due process of law nordeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection ofthe law.''   Roe vs. Wade said women have a constitutional right to abortion,based on their right to privacy.   The court said a woman's decision to have an abortion during thefirst three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor.   It said states may interfere in the abortion decision during thesecond trimester only to protect the woman's health, and may takesteps to protect fetal life only in the third trimester when thefetus is capable of surviving outside the womb.   State authority to regulate abortions after the first trimesterwas not made absolute.   Outside the abortion context, fetal rights had been expandinglong before 1973. The trend has continued since, although affectedby Roe vs. Wade.   Under laws in virtually all states a child has the right toinherit even though he or she was not yet born when the will makerdied.   Since 1946, most states have imposed legal liability _ eithercriminal or civil _ on those who willfully or negligently cause thedeath or injury of a fetus.   For example, the fetus is a person for purposes ofMassachusetts' vehicular homicide law. It is protected by murderstatutes in some states, such as Illinois, Iowa, Michigan,Mississippi, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Utah, Washington andWisconsin.   Two years ago, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that a fetus is aperson for insurance purposes.   The state court said the parents of a 6-month-old fetus who diedas the result of an automobile crash caused by an uninsuredmotorist were entitled to collect from their insurance company for``loss of consortium.''   NARAL's Johnsen said in a recent interview that treating a fetusdifferently in differing legal contexts is not inconsistent andsaid she has no quarrel with laws that protect ``the woman and herwanted fetus.''   In a 1986 law journal article, Johnsen wrote: ``Holding thirdparties responsible for negligent or criminal destruction offetuses is consistent with, and even enhances, the protection ofpregnant women's interests.''   But the article criticized courts for failing ``to recognize thefundamental differences between a woman deciding to terminate herown pregnancy and a third party intruding upon her body to end thatpregnancy against her will.''   James Bopp, general counsel of the National Right to LifeCommittee, bristles when discussing the ``potentiality of humanlife'' phrase used in Roe vs. Wade.   ``Is it human life? Of course,'' he said in an interview. ``Nowoman has ever given birth to anything but a member of the speciesso it is human. And it's a biological fact that it's alive.''   He said, ``The central question is whether the fetus has valuedhuman qualities that society wants to protect. The question iswhether taking the life of the unborn is consequential.''   Johnsen disagrees. ``Defining the fetus as human life does notanswer any questions about the legal status of a fetus,'' she said.``The central question is the legal implications of treating afetus as a person under the law.''   She called extending 14th Amendment protection to a fetus adangerous step because it would necessitate balancing the fetalright to life against a woman's right to privacy.   ``Once you say politicians can speak in behalf of the fetus,there's no stopping point,'' Johnsen said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, April 24</NOTE></DOC>
