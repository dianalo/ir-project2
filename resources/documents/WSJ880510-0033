Rothschild's Mutual-Fund Business </HL><AUTHOR> Michael Siconolfi (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> R BEN </CO><IN> TNM FND </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   When L.F. Rothschild Holdings Inc. agreed to be acquired by Franklin Savings Bank earlier this year, the securities firm's tiny mutual-fund family was left with nowhere to go.    Enter Franklin Resources Inc., the large San Mateo, Calif., mutual fund group. The company -- no relation to Franklin Savings -- quietly has agreed to acquire the four funds run by L.F. Rothschild Fund Management Inc., which have a total of $82 million in assets.    The mutual-fund consolidation was the first in the industry since the stock market crash in October, mutual-fund specialists said. They expect more such combinations to occur among smaller funds, given the recent slump in sales of equity mutual funds.    &quot;Now that the (sales) tide is running out, some funds won't be able to hack it,&quot; said William Lippman, Rothschild's portfolio manager of the funds.    For Franklin Resources, which has more than $33 billion under management, the acquisition fills out its product line, providing it with an intermediate-term bond fund and its first closed-end fund. &quot;It neatly fits some niches we don't have,&quot; said Charles Johnson, Franklin Resource's chairman.    L.F. Rothschild, in a terse statement, didn't give any explanation for the move. But an official close to the fund group said Franklin Savings hadn't any intention of getting involved in the fund business, particularly after Rothschild recently shed its retail sales force.    &quot;With no distribution system, our reason of being disappeared,&quot; the official said.    For Rothschild investors, the change probably won't be traumatic. Mr. Lippman, a respected money manager, will continue to run the four funds as a Franklin Resources senior vice president. If anything, investors likely will benefit from Franklin's expertise in distribution and management. The mutual funds acquisition, which requires shareholder approval, is expected to be completed by July 1.    Some fund names will change: L.F. Rothschild Managed Trust, which consists of three mutual-fund portfolios, will become Franklin Managed Trust. Hampton Utilities Trust, a closed-end fund that trades on the American Stock Exchange, will retain its name. </TEXT></DOC>
