In a letter this week to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, PresidentBush turned down Israel's request for help to rehabilitate camps inthe Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to YossiAhimeir, Shamir's spokesman.   He said Japan, Canada and European nations also rejected therequest.   The Maariv newspaper reported that in his letter Bush said therefugee camps should be part of a ``comprehensive plan to resolvethe conflict'' between Israel and Arab states.   Finance Minister Shimon Peres denounced Shamir's appeal. Israelradio quoted him as saying the move was ``folly lacking elementaryreasoning.''   The national news agency Itim reported that Peres, speaking at aHistadrut Labor Federation meeting Tuesday night, said the first wayto aid the Palestinian refugees in the camps is ``for Israel to getout of there.''   Peres, leader of the socialist Labor Party, has accepted theprinciple of trading land occupied by Israel for peace with its Arabneighbors.   Shamir's conservative Likud bloc, which shares power with Laborin a coalition government, opposes any territorial concessions.   The issue concerns more than 2 million Palestinians who wereuprooted with the founding of the state of Israel in 1948 and duringsubsequent Arab-Israeli wars.   Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left Tuesday forWashington, where officials said he will promote the refugee planand argue against PLO chief Yasser Arafat's being granted a U.S.visa so he can address the U.N. General Assembly.   Israeli soldiers on Tuesday shot and killed an Arab guerrillafound several hundred yards north of the Israeli-Lebanon borderacross from an Israeli communal farm, an army spokeswoman said.   She said two other guerrillas fled after the pre-dawn clash inthe security zone Israel maintains in southern Lebanon. Israeliforces suffered no casualties, according to the spokeswoman.   Military sources said the guerrilla was found with an AK-47assault rifle and grenades. Officials did not identify him or hisorganization.   The spokeswoman was not identified under military regulations.   The army has begun using helicopters to track down wantedPalestinians in remote West Bank villages and mountain hideouts,Israel radio said Tuesday.   An army spokesman said the military has used helicopters forspecific missions but refused comment on the report they would beused in a new strategy to capture leaders in the nearly 21-month-oldPalestinian uprising.   At least 558 Palestinians have been killed in clashes withIsraeli soldiers or civilians in the revolt against Israelioccupation. Thirty-nine Israelis also have died.   The latest Palestinian victim was 12-year-old Ahmed al-Abedel-Bittar, who died Tuesday of wounds suffered in a clash last weekwith soldiers, Arab reports said. He was from Khan Yunis in the GazaStrip.   In the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, masked Palestinian youthsstabbed to death Naeem Fakhri Afana, 27, who was suspected ofcollaborating with Israel, Arab reports said.   At least 107 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs duringthe uprising, most on suspicion of cooperating with Israeliauthorities or for drug dealing or prostitution.   Eight Palestinians were shot and wounded in stone-throwingclashes with Israeli troops on Tuesday, hospital officials said.   The army confirmed the two deaths and one gunshot wound casualty.It said it was checking other reports.   Bush's letter came in response to Shamir's request about twomonths ago for the United States to take a leading role in aidingrehabilitation of the refugee camps, Ahimeir said.   Bush reportedly told Shamir that the United States already playsa prominent role in aiding the refugees by contributing to the U.N.Relief and Works Agency, which administers the refugee camps.   Resolving the refugee problem is a major issue in Shamir's peaceproposal, which centers on his call for elections in the occupiedterritories to select Palestinians to open talks on an interimautonomy agreement.   Palestinian leaders demand that refugees be repatriated. Israelrejects this and also opposes Palestinian demands that the PalestineLiberation Organization be their prime negotiator.</TEXT></DOC>
