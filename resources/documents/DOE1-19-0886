In-vivo counting yieldedan estimate of about 40 mg of natural U initially deposited in the lung.An effective committed dose equivalent in the range of 67 mSv and 137mSv was calculated to correspond to this lung contamination, using asingle exponential lung clearance and the modified ICRP models, respectively.The effective committed dose equivalent of a person 47 y old involvedin this incident can hardly be used to quantify the risk, and thereforecommitted and annual dose equivalent systems were discussed in lightof risk assessment.</TEXT></DOC>
