Bush said he and his fitness czar, actor-bodybuilder ArnoldSchwarzenegger, want to debunk the notion that only the fiscallyfit have the time or means to worry about exercise.   The president, who turns 66 next month, has an array ofexpensive exercise equipment for his personal use a few steps fromthe Oval Office, not to mention a horseshoe pit, heated pool andtennis court nearby.   Bush captained the baseball team at Yale and has played tennisand golf all his life. He still jogs three times a week for twomiles at a ``slowpoke'' 9{-minute pace. The 6-foot-2 president saidhe is about five pounds overweight.   Bush credits all this exercise with helping him keep up a daily7 a.m.-to-6 p.m. schedule in the Oval Office, plus ``two or threeother events'' at home in the evenings.   ``I don't believe I could do that if I weren't physically fit,''he told interviewers.   ``People think, `What's this Ivy League elitist doing playinghorseshoes? This is some put-on deal,''' said Bush. ``But now theyknow I like it and, as Arnold can attest, I'm reasonably good.''   Bush acknowledged he came from a privileged background wherecompetitive sports were part of growing up.   ``I'm not suggesting that everybody's had it so good,'' he said.``But I am suggesting that an example of an athletic presidency canset a tone for this concept of fitness that Arnold and I areworking together on.''   The writers pressed the president on what he planned to do forAmericans who cannot afford to see a doctor. An estimated 30million Americans, most in working poor families, have no healthinsurance.   Bush said Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan issearching for ways ``to get control of costs. And if we can dothat, I think that will expand services.''   Asked if health care should be a basic right for all citizens,he said: ``I would think so, yes. But that doesn't mean that Ithink the federal government is the only way to do it.''   ``All levels of government'' must be involved, plus charitablecare and ``neighbor helping neighbor,'' Bush said.</TEXT></DOC>
