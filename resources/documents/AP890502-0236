The nation's cable system operators vow to fight Pacific'splans, fearing that the phone companies' far greater financialresources will muscle aside competition and concerned thattelephone companies may, if allowed by the federal government tobuy in, be able within a few years to provide phone and televisionservice through a single cable.   The initial battleground is Chicago. Pacific announced lastmonth it intends to buy an interest _ worth more than $100 million_ in a system serving 97,000 homes in the Windy City.   Before that can happen, though, Pacific must win approval fromthe Federal Communications Commission and from the federal judgewho oversees operations of the seven regional telephone companiesthat were created with the breakup of the Bell System in 1984.   The seven ``Baby Bells'' have been barred by U.S. Districe JudgeHarold Greene from generating information services, including cableTV programming, out of fear they could use their vast financialresources to compete unfairly.   But the regional companies, including Pacific, are allowed toenter the cable television business outside their telephone serviceareas if they can show they will not use their monopoly powers toimpede competition in the cable market they enter.   Pacific announced April 20 it had reached a tentative agreementto buy, through a series of transactions, a 68 percent interest inthe Chicago system. Now owned by Group W, the system would bepurchased for $198 million by an affiliate of Prime Cable ofAustin, Texas. Prime would operate the system, which serves 97,000customers in a franchise area of 410,000 homes.   One telecommunications industry analyst, Berge Ayvazian ofBoston's Yankee Group, said the Chicago deal had been ``verycarefully structured ... to test the limits'' of Greene'srestrictions on the Baby Bells' operatons.   ``This is a breakthrough for them if they get away with it,'' headded.   The Justice Department has already approved Pacific's plans. Thecompany intends to ask Greene for a waiver this summer.   The Bell companies, particularly Pacific, have been pecking awayat the fringes of the cable business while hoping that someday theywill be free to compete fully in cable TV.   Pacific must persuade Greene that a waiver would not impede theoperations and profit potential of other Chicago cable systems.   ``They stand a pretty good chance of getting the waiver,'' saidHenry Geller, a former Federal Communications Commission officialand director of Duke University's Center for Public PolicyResearch. ``They're clearly going to argue ... they don't have amonopoly in Chicago.''   An association representing cable operators will argue beforeGreene that granting Pacific a waiver would substantially undercuthis 1984 decree.   ``We support the consent decree, which is premised onjustifiable fears of telephone companies using their huge monopolyphone business to cross-subsidize (cable operations) and otherwiseimpede competiton,'' said James Mooney, president of the NationalCable Television Association, an industry trade group.   ``One of the (Baby Bells) has a gross revenue base that is aslarge as the entire cable television industry,'' said StephenEffros, president of the Community Antenna Television Association,another cable operators' trade group.   Besides concerns that the phone companies' very size couldradically alter their industry, cable operators fear that thefiber-optic cables being installed by phone companies to replacecopper wires could one day eliminate the need for a separate cableto deliver television signals to customers.   Telephone companies are replacing thousands of miles of wireeach year with fiber cables, those pencil-thin bundles of glassstrands capable of transmitting enormous amounts of information onbeams of laser light.   If extended directly to customers' homes, a single fiber-opticcable could at the same time carry television signals, telephonecalls and computer data.   Southwestern Bell and Sammons Cable are testing new cabletechnology in the Fort Worth, Texas, area, and the FCC last weekallowed a non-Bell company, General Telephone of California, toconstruct a system using both conventional coaxial cable, made ofcopper, and fiber-optic cable in Cerritos, Calif., a Los Angelessuburb that also gets its phone service from the GTE subsidiary.   Cable industry critics say that it will cost telephone companies$500 billion to completely convert to fiber optics and that sellingTV programming would be a fine way to make up the expense.   Raymond W. Smith of Bell Atlantic, another of the Baby Bells,told broadcasters last week in Las Vegas that only by allowingtelephone companies to provide video programming will a full fiberoptic network _ with the cables extending to individual homes _ becompleted in this century.   ``In my view, only one factor could accelerate this timetabledramatically _ allowing telephone companies to cover the costs offiber-to-the-home with revenues'' from a range of services,including television transmission.   Many in Congress and at the FCC think it is time to unleash thetelephone companies to compete in the information service andtelecommunications equipment-manufacturing businesses.   Members of Congress concerned about such things, such as Reps.John Dingell, D-Mich.; Al Swift, D-Wash., and Tom Tauke, R-Iowa,want to relieve Greene of his oversight of the Bell companies. Lastmonth, they introduced legislation to lift those two restraints onthe Bell companies.   While the bill would not let the Bell companies into cable TV,there is a growing feeling that the existing cable TV industrycould stand a little competition.   FCC Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis has said repeatedly thatthe federal government should now establish rules to assure thatfiber-optic phone lines carry a ``cornucopia'' of voice, video anddata into the nation's homes.   The FCC began relaxing its restrictions on phone companies'entry into cable television last July, when it voted to considerrecommending to Congress that the companies be allowed into cableTV even in the regions where they provide phone service.   The commission also suggested it would try to encourge telephonecompanies to enter cable TV if Congress fails to act by broadlydefining ``good cause'' for waivers from its existing regulations.   The FCC said it probably would grant waivers if telephonecompanies wire homes with fiber and allow competitors to use thosecables to sell video programs too.   With this writing on the wall, many cable TV executives arelooking to involve telephone companies as partners in cable systemsoutside telephone company service areas.   ``There'a major split within the cable industry on that issue,''Effros said. ``Frankly, I don't think many cable operators woulddisagree that we could live with telephone companies'' outsidetheir service areas.   ``Their money is as green as anyone else's and the amounts ofmoney needed to continually improve cable TV ... is massive, so itwould be nice to get a new influx of money,'' Effros said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for AMs Sun May 7 and thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
