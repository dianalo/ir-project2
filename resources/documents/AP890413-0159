In the first case, the Commerce Department issued orders denyingexport privileges to Goran Josberg and his firms, Globe Trade,Globe Computers and Globe Metals of Stockholm, Sweden, and toHelmut Keck and his firm, OTC Mess-Und Videoteknik, GmbH, ofHamburg, West Germany.   Josberg's denial of export privileges extends for 35 years andKeck's for 10 years, the agency said.   Between 1983 and 1985, Josburg allegedly directed a conspiracyin which Keck and others received sophisticated U.S. technology andequipment through Keck's dummy corporations in West Germany, thedepartment said. The two then allegedly re-exported the technologythrough Finland to the Soviet Union without authorization from theCommerce Department.   The equipment included a WAS-3000 airstream modulator that hasdirect military applications because it is used to test missilesand missile components, said Paul Freedenberg, undersecretary forexport administration.   ``Some members of this high-tech diversion ring posed aslegitimate businessmen in Sweden, West Germany and Singapore toacquire U.S.-origin technology for their carefully planned schemeto supply highly sought-after, militarily useful items to East Bloccountries,'' Freedenberg said.   In the latter case, the Commerce Department issued a 180-day banon export privileges for four businessmen and their firms becausethey were suspected of trying to obtain U.S.-origin equipment forillegal export to Bulgaria.   The order, effective April 6, covers Franciscus B. Govaerts andhis firm, Printlas Europa; Goris Christiaan Grandia and his firm,Grandia Project Services; Marcel Sanders and his firm, BelgianTrading Company Lokeren S.A. and Roger Van Alphen.   The department alleged that Govaerts attempted to export amemory test system and laser repair system to Grandia and VanAlphen in the Netherlands by falsely describing the equipment on ashipper's export declaration.   Grandia and Van Alphen, with the help of Sanders, planned tore-export the equipment to Grandia's customers in Bulgaria withoutapproval, the agency said. Sanders allegedly was to finance theillegal purchase and shipment, Commerce said.   Govaerts and Sanders were arrested on related charges inDecember and are awaiting trial; Grandia was arrested in Italy andhas been released on bail pending extradition to the United States;Van Alphen still is at large, the department said.</TEXT></DOC>
