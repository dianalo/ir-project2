John Waihee said lastweek.   The U.S. weapons from West Germany would add 100,000 rounds tothe 300,000 rounds of nerve and mustard gas stored at the remoteisland since 1971.   The transport of the munitions from West Germany will beginThursday and would continue through September, Pentagon spokesmanPete Williams said Tuesday. Containers holding the weapons will beloaded onto Navy ships for transport to the Pacific.   The containers will be put in storage on Johnston Atoll untilthe Army finishes testing an incinerator for the munitions. Thetests are to be completed late next year, and full-scaledestruction is not expected to begin until 1992.   The Army said moving the weapons and destroying them at JohnstonAtoll would have minimal public health, safety and environmentaleffects.   ``Safety of people and nations and protection of the environmentis foremost in our minds,'' said John Fairbank, a spokesman for theArmy Western Command in Honolulu.   ``The good part is we are in fact destroying a very unpopularweapon,'' Fairbank said. ``The end result when we get through isall of the weapons will be destroyed. We think theenvironmentalists should cheer that goal.''   There's been little cheering.   ``Transporting the European stockpile halfway around the worldinescapably increases the risks,'' said a statement issued by theFederated States of Micronesia, a former U.S. territory.   Leaders of the Marshall Islands, Cook Islands, New Zealand andthe U.S. territory of American Samoa also have expressedreservations about the plan.   While most of the leaders have said they support destruction ofthe weapons, they said they worry about the environmental dangersof transporting the weapons across the Pacific and destroying themat Johnston Atoll.   The Pacific Council of Churches, representing 26 Protestant andRoman Catholic churches in the South Pacific, asked the Army tocancel the move. The Hawaii Legislature and Honolulu City Councilalso have objected.   Spaulding said the Sierra Club Legal Defense Club was planninglegal action to halt the shipment of the weapons until officialshave fully assessed the dangers.   ``The problem with Johnston Atoll is this is an unproventechnology,'' Spaulding said. ``It hasn't been tested enough toprove it's safe.''   Fairbanks responded that the Army has tested the incinerationtechnology. ``This isn't something that we're just jumping off anddoing all of a sudden,'' he said.   He agreed that the safest way to get rid of the weapons is todestroy them in place. However, he said, ``We could not do that inGermany because they are our munitions on foreign soil and we'veagreed to remove them.''   Fairbank emphasized that the weapons at Johnston Atoll combinedwith the weapons from West Germany represent about 6 percent of theUnited States' chemical weapons. He said the Army has no plans touse Johnston Atoll to destroy munitions from mainland storage sites.   The $240 million disposal system was built to meet a 1985congressional requirement to destroy all U.S. chemical weapons by1997.   The Army began testing the incinerator on June 30.</TEXT></DOC>
