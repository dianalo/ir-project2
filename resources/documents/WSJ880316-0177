Her memoirs are entitled &quot;Woman of Violence.&quot; He was one of her commanders. Their organization carried out assassinations, bombings, massacres.    Today, Geula Cohen and Yitzhak Shamir sit in the Israeli Knesset and refuse to negotiate with terrorists -- by which they mean the Palestine Liberation Organization. If Israel once could afford a certain amount of hypocrisy about the PLO, the price now is increasing rapidly. In scores of interviews with Palestinians -- from fiery-eyed rock-throwers to urbane professionals -- there is overwhelming insistence that the PLO, not Jordan, must represent them in negotiations with Israel.    As far as the Palestinians are concerned, Secretary of State George Shultz jetted around the Middle East recently trying to knit a peace initiative using only one needle. It's fine to touch down in Tel Aviv, in Cairo, in Amman. But the most important &quot;yes&quot; will have to come from the occupied territories, from the Arab towns of Nablus, Ramallah, Gaza and ultimately, PLO headquarters in Tunis -- destinations that were barred from Mr. Shultz's itinerary by official policy in both Israel and America that prohibits talking to the PLO.    If 40 years of stillborn Middle East peace initiatives have proved anything, it is that there is no detour around the Palestinians, who insist that their representative is the PLO. The Camp David peace treaty envisioned not only peace between Egypt and Israel but a resolution of the Palestinian problem that could bring a broader peace between Israel and her other Arab neighbors. But that peace was stunted. Without the PLO, Camp David couldn't deliver the comprehensive peace that Anwar Sadat and Jimmy Carter sought. If Egypt, the largest Arab nation, couldn't deliver a comprehensive peace alone, Jordan, a small and fragile kingdom, certainly can't.    Unfortunate, surely. The PLO has a loathesome record. It commits unspeakable acts against civilians and daily threatens the lives of Israeli soldiers. Its rhetoric is about as objectionable as can be; its duplicity renowned.    But when Britain ruled Palestine, it loathed Mr. Shamir's Stern Gang. It sentenced Ms. Cohen to nine years in prison for her activities on that organization's behalf. More recently, the U.S. and the South Vietnamese weren't warmly disposed to the Viet Cong. That is the nature of enmity: Your enemy hates you, kills you, threatens your children and your very existence.    But if you want peace, you have only two choices: crush the enemy, or talk with it. As the uprising in its occupied territories so graphically shows, Israel has failed to do the former. The U.S., meanwhile, abets its continued refusal to contemplate the latter.    The Reagan administration excoriated Daniel Ortega for his unwillingness to negotiate with the Contras. It continues to quibble with Pretoria for ignoring the African National Congress. But in a remarkable demonstration of inconsistency, it not only applauds Israel's deafness to the PLO, it stuffs legislative plugs in its own ears as well.    No one expects Mr. Shamir to run right down to the airport and embrace Yasser Arafat. What's needed now, many Palestinians argue, is a round of technical talks at which leaders needn't even appear. Let some of Israel's best diplomatic minds sit down with some thoughtful Palestinian technicians and hammer out just what it is that both sides might -- just might -- be able to agree upon.    What could this possibly cost Israel? Too many Israelis right now seem to think that to negotiate means the same as to capitulate. It doesn't.    At worst, the parties will find each other's position unconscionable and both sides will be stuck with the status quo. Israel will have lost nothing. On the contrary, it will have proved once again that it is indeed the party prepared to reach out for peace -- an assertion that has worn a little threadbare in recent years, thanks to the nay-saying of Mr. Shamir and his sizable Knesset chorus.    Ms. Cohen, his former Stern Gang colleague, is one of the most strident voices against compromise in the Knesset. She quit Likud and founded the ultranationalist Tehiya Party in protest of the Camp David peace treaty. But as a passionate nationalist, she of all people should recognize what Israel is up against in its PLO adversary.    In his 1987 book, &quot;Sands of Sorrow,&quot; Milton Viorst quotes Ms. Cohen's description of her 1946 trial at the hands of the British. As the judge passed sentence, her mother stood up in the courtroom and began singing the Jewish anthem. &quot;I remember the face of the judge as if it was yesterday,&quot; Ms. Cohen says. &quot;When my mother was singing the song, I saw the thought written on his face, 'With such mothers, we can't win.'&quot;    If Ms. Cohen has been to Gaza or the West Bank in recent months, she's undoubtedly looked into the faces of Palestinian mothers handing rocks to their children as they confront Israeli guns. It would be interesting to know what conclusion she's drawn.    ---   Ms. Brooks covers the Mideast for the Journal.
