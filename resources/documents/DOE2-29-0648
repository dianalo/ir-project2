Refining started in the province in 1927, butexcess capacity and stringent environmental standards caused the lastoperating refinery to close in 1983. The industry today is still activein exploration and drilling and in oil and gas production, 1987 oil productionbeing valued at about $110 million. Productive oil formations total four,with a number of pre-Mississippian formations in the southwest havinghydrocarbon potential.
