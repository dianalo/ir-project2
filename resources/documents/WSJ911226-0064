You'll find yourself bombarded with claims and smotheredby techno-babble -- terms like &quot;nanoseconds&quot; and &quot;RAM cache&quot;that might as well be Greek, even to many salespeople.   But keep your eye on the ball. Two of the most importantfactors in choosing a personal computer are how much memoryis included, and how much disk storage capacity it features.They can play a greater role in your satisfaction with yourcomputer than the minor differences in processing speed thatcomputer vendors love to play up. Last week, I explained thecore concepts of memory and disks. This week, I'll talk aboutusing that knowledge.   The basic rule about memory and storage is this: Buy asmuch as you can afford at first, even if it means sacrificingother bells and whistles.   There's nothing more frustrating than laying out thousandsof dollars for a computer and then finding you can't run newprograms or even put them on your hard disk because you'reout of room. Some modern software will suck up most of amegabyte (the equivalent of a million typed characters) ofyour memory just to load, and even some games take up fourmegabytes on a hard disk. In general, software will runfaster, and with fewer crashes, if you have plenty of memoryand hard-drive space. Cutting either to the bone invitesheadaches.                                                                                                          MOREOVER, extra memory and added hard disk space arerelatively inexpensive parts of a PC's overall price. Onceyou're putting together a configuration, an added megabyte ofmemory can often be had for $50 or $60, and a 50% increase inhard disk capacity can cost less than $200.   Given today's hardware and software, two megabytes ofmemory and an 80-megabyte hard disk drive are a bare minimumon either a Macintosh or an IBM-compatible PC. But I'd adviseaiming for four megabytes of memory and a 100-megabyte harddrive, especially if you're planning to run Microsoft'sWindows 3.0 software system on an IBM-compatible, or Apple'snew System 7 software on a Macintosh.   IBM-compatible buyers should also be sure to get twofloppy drives (to handle both 5-inch and 3-inch disks), and acomputer whose memory can be expanded using easily insertablemodules called SIMMs. These modules can be bought by mail forunder $50 per megabyte of capacity. Even with extra memoryinstalled, IBM-compatible owners may have to delve intomanuals to make sure their computers and software can use itproperly. Incredibly, the main operating system for thesepopular machines, Microsoft's MS-DOS, is still based on anold concept that limited usable memory to just 640 kilobytes.The latest version, version 5, strives to overcome its rootswith a special program called a memory manager to fool thesystem into using more memory. But it can be tricky to getevery program to share memory smoothly.   One way around this is to rely on the Windows program andthose application programs specifically designed to work withit. They automatically recognize and apportion added memory.                                                                                                          ALL THIS is much simpler for Macintosh owners. The Macuses only plug-in memory modules, its operating systemautomatically recognizes all the memory present, and all Macsoftware can share it. But be aware that the twolowest-priced models, the heavily promoted Classic andClassic II, can accept less memory than the others and comein a sealed case that complicates memory expansion. Armedwith your new knowledge about memory, you'll find some of thecomputer ads you see a bit less beguiling. Take the ZeosInternational ad in a current computer magazine. It offersfor &quot;only $1,195&quot; a computer with &quot;ultra high speed&quot; memorychips. Unfortunately, there aren't enough of them to do muchuseful work on modern software.   Indeed, this bargain Zeos comes with a paltryhalf-megabyte memory and a 42-megabyte hard drive, and lacksa floppy disk drive for the new 3-inch disks. A call to thecompany finds that it costs $1,662.75 for the same unit withfour megabytes of memory, an 85-megabyte hard drive and the3-inch floppy disk drive. (Adding a color monitor, mousedevice and Windows software brings it to over $2,000.)   The Zeos ad isn't unique, nor is it deceptive; all thedetails are plainly spelled out. And the company, which has areputation for both good quality and low price, offers morecomplete configurations on other pages of the same magazine.But a novice buyer might never get past the alluring $1,195price and could wind up with plenty of heartburn.   If you're absolutely certain you're going to run onlytext-based word processors or spreadsheets on anIBM-compatible, or simple word processors and spreadsheets ona Mac, you can settle for a basic box with one megabyte ofmemory and a 40-megabyte hard drive. If not, go for as muchcapacity as possible. You won't regret it.</TEXT></DOC>
