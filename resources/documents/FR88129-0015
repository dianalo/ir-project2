(2) Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts File System, JUSTICE/CIV-005. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in thesesystems is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j)(2), (k)(1)and (k)(2).   (b) Only that information which relates to the investigation, prosecution,or defense of actual or potential criminal or civil litigation, or whichhas been properly classified in the interest of national defense and foreignpolicy is exempted for the reasons set forth from the following subsections:  (1) <T3>Subsection (c)(3). </T3>To provide the subject of a criminal or civilmatter or case under investigation with an accounting of disclosures ofrecords concerning him or her would inform that individual (and othersto whom the subject might disclose the records) of the existence, nature,or scope of that investigation and thereby seriously impede law enforcementefforts by permitting the record subject and others to avoid criminal penaltiesand civil remedies.   (2) <T3>Subsections (c)(4), (e)(4) (G) and (H), and (g). </T3>These provisionsare inapplicable to the extent that these systems of records are exemptedfrom subsection (d).   (3) <T3>Subsection (d). </T3>To the extent that information contained in thesesystems has been properly classified, relates to the investigation and/orprosecution of grand jury, civil fraud, and other law enforcement matters,disclosure could compromise matters which should be kept secret in theinterest of national security or foreign policy; compromise confidentialinvestigations or proceedings; hamper sensitive civil or criminal investigations;impede affirmative enforcement actions based upon alleged violations ofregulations or of civil or criminal laws; reveal the identity of confidentialsources; and result in unwarranted invasions of the privacy of others.Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcementproceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiringcriminal investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.   (4) <T3>Subsection (e)(1). </T3>In the course of criminal or civil investigations,cases, or matters, the Civil Division may obtain information concerningthe actual or potential violation of laws which are not strictly withinits statutory authority. In the interest of effective law enforcement,it is necessary to retain such information since it may establish patternsof criminal activity or avoidance of other civil obligations and provideleads for Federal and other law enforcement agencies.   (5) <T3>Subsection (e)(2). </T3>To collect information from the subject ofa criminal investigation or prosecution would present a serious impedimentto law enforcement in that the subject (and others to whom the subjectmight be in contact) would be informed of the existence of the investigationand would therefore be able to avoid detection or apprehension, to influencewitnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony.  (6) <T3>Subsection (e)(3). </T3>To comply with this requirement during thecourse of a criminal investigation or prosecution could jeopardize theinvestigation by disclosing the existence of a confidential investigation,revealing the identity of witnesses or confidential informants, or impedingthe information gathering process.   (7) <T3>Subsection (e)(5). </T3>In compiling information for criminal law enforcementpurposes, the accuracy, completeness, timeliness and relevancy of the informationobtained cannot always be immediately determined. As new details of aninvestigation come to light, seemingly irrelevant or untimely informationmay acquire new significance and the accuracy of such information can oftenonly be determined in a court of law. Compliance with the requirement wouldtherefore restrict the ability of government attorneys in exercising theirjudgment in developing information necessary for effective law enforcement.  (8) <T3>Subsection (e)(8). </T3>To serve notice would give persons sufficientwarning to evade law enforcement efforts.
