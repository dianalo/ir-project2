(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal agency recommended Friday thatPresident Bush intervene and block a strike planned next week byEastern Airlines mechanics and ground personnel, an administrationofficial said.   The National Mediation Board suggested Bush name a presidentialemergency board to investigate the protracted dispute, saidpresidential spokesman B. Jay Cooper, accompanying Bush on athree-nation trip to the Far East.   If Bush accepted the recommendation it would automatically delaythe strike, schedule to begin March 4, by 60 days.   ``It's under review,'' Cooper said of the recommendation. He saidthe president will consult with the Labor, Transportation andJustice departments before deciding.   An earlier order blocking a strike expires at midnight March 3,in effect imposing a deadline of midnight next Friday for Bush toact.   If Bush approves the recommendation, the union will be restrainedfrom striking during a 30-day investigation and a follow-on 30-daycooling off period.   The mediation board made the recommendations after a final roundof mediation with Eastern management and representatives of theInternational Association of Machinists failed to produce asettlement in the 16-month dispute, the sources said.   Attempts to reach board officials Friday after word of therecommendation surfaced were unsuccessful. But grounds forrecommending such a panel include a finding that a strike probablywould cause an emergency in the affected industry.   Labor leaders have been urging Bush to intervene in the dispute,which centers on Eastern's demands for $150 million a year in annualconcessions from the Machinists union.   The union contends Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air Corp.,which owns Eastern, is trying to destroy the airline and incorporatemost of its operations into non-union Continental Airlines, anotherTexas Air property.   ``I would hope the president would accept the board'srecommendation for the good of the workers and the good of theairline,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said when informed of themediation board's recommendation.   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell, asked for the airline's reactionto the NMB recommendation referred to a Tuesday letter to the boardfrom Thomas J. Matthews, Eastern's senior vice president for humanresources, who was responding to reports the board was leaningtoward asking Bush to intervene.   ``This course of action as the effect of almost totally undermingthe negotiations,'' the letter said. ``Is the NMB trying to createan atmosphere for an agreement or do the bidding for one side? ...There is no precedent for this action in the airline industry.''   The letter said there was no evidence interstate commerce wouldbe disrupted during a strike, grounds for presidential interventionunder the Railway-Labor Act.   Several labor leaders familiar with labor laws said it isunprecedented for a president to ignore recommendations from themediation board to name an emergency panel.   Such boards have 60 days to review the dispute and to makecontract proposals. If the board's final offer is rejected the panelcan submit it to Congress, which then can enter the contract-writingbusiness by imposing the proposal on both sides in the dispute.</TEXT></DOC>
