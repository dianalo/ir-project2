The courageous couple have already sacrificed careers and health to exercise their human right to voice a political opinion. The news that these two will not have to live out their years under house arrest in Gorky comes alongside the recent release and emigration of a number of other dissidents, including Yuri Orlov, Anatoly Shcharansky and Irina Ratushinskaya. It's premature, however, to concede Moscow any claim to the moral high ground.    The so-called &quot;resolution&quot; of these celebrated cases came amid laboriously orchestrated publicity. Mr. Sakharov's 24-hour guard was sent away and a telephone was installed, after he had lived without one for seven years, so that Mr. Gorbachev could ring him up with the good news.    Never before has a Soviet leader engaged a prominent opposition figure in such a dialogue. Mr. Sakharov wasn't awed. After thanking the general secretary, the physicist, who in 1980 was banished without trial to Gorky for criticizing the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, expressed his sorrow over the recent &quot;murder&quot; of his friend Anatoly Marchenko in a prison camp. He implored Mr. Gorbachev to free all other &quot;prisoners of conscience.&quot; Mr. Gorbachev disagreed with these views.    Nor has Mr. Gorbachev given any sign that he is concerned about the fate of 600 or so other less-publicized political prisoners and psychiatric patients tracked by organizations such as Amnesty International, and of untold thousands whose status is unknown to the West. Nor do the weekend developments resolve the basic grievances that led to these illegal incarcerations. Moreover, the future status of the Sakharovs themselves remains ambiguous.    The real significance in the release of Mr. Sakharov will be found less in what it suggests about the state of Soviet human rights than in the domestic and foreign pressures coming to bear on Mr. Gorbachev. The pace of recent Soviet activity seems to indicate the Kremlin's pot is aboil.    The Soviets have just threatened to end their nuclear test moratorium. Pravda has named and assailed the last major Soviet party boss, Leonid Brezhnev. And the Kremlin has publicized riots in the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan.    Much of this may be attributed to the Gorbachev glasnost policy of &quot;openness.&quot; A handy device to disarm political opponents, glasnost could get out of control and vent latent discontent among the Soviet masses. Glasnost can't indefinitely paper over the substantive issues bedeviling the Soviets.    These include energy shortages and a stagnating economy, to which Mr. Gorbachev's own oft-voiced frustrations are testament. The Kazakhstan riots suggest that nationalist ferment is recurring. The foreign-policy picture is equally bleak.    The toll in the Afghan war is accelerating. A report just released by the American State Department counts at least 3,000 Soviet casualties this year, bringing the total since 1979 to 35,000, more than a third of them deaths. The nation is also suffering from the campaign's financial and political burdens; the same study says that for the past three months the Mujahedeen shot down an average of one Soviet plane or helicopter a day.    Mr. Gorbachev is under even greater pressure on the strategic front. The prospect of having to engage the scientific and productive capacities of the U.S. in a race to develop the technologies associated with strategic defense must appall the proprietor of a poorly functioning economy. Weapons building in a Marxist economy based on state allocation of scarce resources has little benefit for the civilian sector, which it simply displaces ruble for ruble.    All this adds up to significant pressure for which Mr. Gorbachev must find release. Note, therefore, that the sole favorable concession Pravda made in its recent criticism of Leonid Brezhnev was &quot;the policy of detente.&quot; Mr. Gorbachev's rule so far has been noteworthy for its aggressive efforts at public relations. Rekindling the detente of the 1970s would be a rational goal for his efforts to appear reasonable and conciliatory. During detente the Soviets got cheap grain, credit and technology from the U.S.; that in turn allowed them to solidify their newly gained parity in nuclear strength.    In his country's current circumstances, Mr. Gorbachev is playing a high-stakes game in which the margin for error is small. The phone call to Gorky sought to enlist Mr. Sakharov's prestige in the general secretary's game. </TEXT></DOC>
