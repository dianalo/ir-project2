(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pat Thompson can't walk much anymore.   She is only 49, but has lung disease and uses an electricscooter to go shopping and take her treasured neighborhood walks,all the time hooked up to an oxygen tank.   ``I had a real intimidation about using'' the three-wheeledscooter, Mrs. Thompson. ``What will they think? What will theysay?''   ``They,'' she said, was ``everyone around me - that silly notionthat everybody's looking.''   That's not a problem anymore, and as using scooters becomes moreacceptable to older people and those with disabilities, thequestion will increasingly focus on a consumer issue: which one tobuy.   On a bright, clear, cool morning, 16 people set out on scootersalong the six-mile bicycle and walking path at Valley ForgeNational Historical Park to help find that answer.   Only one scooter broke down, about two miles into the tour pastmonuments and small log cabins that mark where Washington's troopsholed up for the winter of 1776.   ECRI, a non-profit evaluator of healthcare technology originallycalled Emergency Care Resource Institute, is trying to help othersdo what Mrs. Thompson had to do herself.   The models tested by ECRI show what consumers face when choosinga scooter. Some had three wheels, some four; some had twobatteries, some one; some can turn more easily in tight spots; onehad large wheels and thus better suited to outdoor use. Some havecloth seats, some vinyl, which can be important to someone withincontinence.   Mrs. Thompson last year tried out five scooters, without theinformation ECRI hopes to provide.   ``Especially after sharing it with so many people at the beachthis summer, I think it's important that people have theinformation on what it can do for them,'' said Mrs. Thompson, ofnearby Plymouth Meeting.   ``For me personally, I wanted to be able to use it in the house.I wanted to be able to use it in small spaces. And I wanted to beable to assemble and disassemble it myself.''   ``Mine takes me around my neighborhood real nicely - stop andvisit the dogs and the kids. The other thing is braking, how it'llhandle a hill, its maneuverability, whether it'll tip.''   Those are exactly the kinds of concerns ECRI investigated withthe financial help of the National Institute of Disability Researchand Rehabilitation, the U.S. Department of Education and theNational Rehabilitation Hospital.   The engineers and other ECRI employees at Valley Forge ratedscooters for comfort, hill-climbing, braking, stability of theride, driver fatigue, speed control and battery power. The outdoortest is part of the testing from which ECRI expects to releaseresults around next June.   Mrs. Thompson said her scooter will tip, but that if she gets ina tricky spot she can get a foot out to brace herself. Many peoplewho use such vehicles - such as stroke patients with some paralysis- aren't so fortunate, said Kenneth Brown of ECRI.   ``You don't have an arm to brace yourself. You just kind of goover in it,'' said Brown, who leaned to one side on two wheels todemonstrate.   Sharon Lawler, a marketing specialist for ECRI who rode one ofthe scooters, said ECRI has no ties to manufacturers. ``That waypeople can be sure that our data is at least objective.''   Her scooter made it, but Rob Schluth's didn't have the power tohandle the hills at the park. That won't ruin its evaluation,ECRI's Brown said. It will simply put it in perspective of what isdetermined in other tests that may make it good for indoor use.   ``If the unit is acceptable, it would be conditionallyacceptable, that you don't take it out on rough terrain,'' he said.   Having 15 finishers impressed Brown. ``I didn't expect this manyto do this well. A lot of these models were indoor models and theyhandled the park very well,'' he said.   Scooter prices range from $1,500 to $3,500, Brown said.Generally, insurance has not helped pay the bill, he said.   Pat Suda, national sales director for scooter manufacturerOrtho-Kinetics of Waukesha, Wis., said Medicare rarely reimbursesfor the scooters. She said the company is telling distributors,``Be prepared to ask for cash, don't ask what their insurance is.''   She agrees with ECRI that projections of the aging of the U.S.population promises growth in the scooter market. Al Thieme hasseen the growth firsthand. Thieme made his first scooter 22 yearsago for his wife, who suffered multiple sclerosis. Now he has a $9million business as president of Amigo, a Bridgeport, Mich.-basedmanufacturer of scooters.   ``Today there's a lot of competition. There are probably 20different manufacturers in the United States and I would say 20 to25 manufacturers in other countries,'' Thieme said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thursday, Oct. 18</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
