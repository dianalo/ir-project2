RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today agreed to decidewhether lawyers who win civil rights cases can collect a big chunkof their clients' awards under an agreement made when the attorneyswere hired.   The court said it will hear an appeal by a California manawarded $2.12 million and then ordered to pay 40 percent of thejudgment to his lawyer.   The case stems from a federal lawsuit by Juan Francisco Venegasagainst Long Beach police officers. Venegas was imprisoned for 2{years for a murder conviction obtained with perjured evidence,according to court records.   Venegas hired Michael Mitchell to represent him in the suit andagreed to a pay the lawyer 40 percent of any award he won.   A federal court also awarded Mitchell $75,000 in legal fees, anamount to be paid by the police officers.   Mitchell and Venegas parted ways in 1986 when the lawyer askedfor another 10 percent of the judgment to represent him on appealand Venegas refused.   The lawyer then filed a court motion to place a lien on thejudgment to recover his 40 percent contingent fee, or $406,000.   A federal judge gave Mitchell a partial victory, ruling he maybe entitled to the contingent fee but leaving the matter to a statecourt to decide.   Mitchell won a bigger victory before the 9th U.S. Circuit Courtof Appeals.   The appeals court last April sent the case back to the federaljudge to reconsider the lawyer's bid to enforce a lien on the $2.12million award.   The appeals court also said that under federal civil rights law,Mitchell is not limited to court-awarded attorneys' fees when acontingency fee agreement exists with a client.   Federal law ``does not place a ceiling on an attorney'sentitlement under a contingency fee agreement,'' the appeals courtsaid. ``Fairness requires that we respect the freedom of clientsand attorneys to agree to a contingency fee in excess'' of anycourt award.   Venegas also argued that Mitchell misled him when they made thecontingency fee agreement. Venegas said Mitchell did not tell himabout the benefits the lawyer was entitled to receive under federalcivil rights law.   The case is Venegas vs. Mitchell, 88-1725.</TEXT></DOC>
