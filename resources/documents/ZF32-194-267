(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Two high-capacity data-storage backup systems -- 4mm DAT and 8mm tape -- areattracting attention in the Macintosh network market.andP;  Both methods arehelical-scan recording devices that offer at least 1.3 Gbytes of storage, butthey differ in other ways.andM;The knock against 8mm tape is that Exabyte Corp. of Boulder, Colo., is theonly manufacturer.andP;  Several manufacturers market DAT drives, resulting inmore price competition.andP;  DAT, however, has lower capacities.andM;andgt;Pricing.andP;  Several vendors sell 8mm products in the Mac market, includingTecmar Inc., a subsidiary of Rexon Inc.; Contemporary Cybernetics Group Inc.;andO;and Transitional Technology Inc.andP;  An 8mm system is priced between $5,000 and$8,000.andP;  DAT drives sell for as low as $1,700, and prices are dropping.andM;andgt;Capacity.andP;  While 8mm drives offer higher capacity -- 2.2 Gbytes comparedwith DAT's 1.3 Gbytes -- both technologies are expanding their storagevolume.andM;Kelly Beavers, vice president of customer satisfaction at Exabyte, said hiscompany is shipping a 5-Gbyte drive called the EXB-8500.andP;  DAT vendors,though, predict they'll reach 5 Gbytes soon through data compression andextended tapes.andM;andgt;Performance.andP;  Exabyte 8mm drives have a faster transfer rate than 4mm DATdrives, but DAT has a much faster file-search capability.andP;  An end-to-end filesearch of an 8mm drive would take about 16 minutes, but it would take lessthan one minute with DAT, said Todd Smith, manager of storage products withTecmar.andM;&quot;Waiting to find what you're looking for is the major drawback to 8mm,&quot; saidRandy Yerzyk, manager of Macintosh systems with Shepley Bulfinch Richardsonand Abbott Inc., an architecture company in Boston.andM;Exabyte's new EXB-8200SX drive could solve the speed problem.andM;&quot;Through a hardware and software combination, Exabyte enhanced the originalproduct to yield a much faster file-to-file movement,&quot; said Bob Abraham, vicepresident of Freeman Associates Inc., a tape-backup consulting firm in SantaBarbara, Calif.andP;  &quot;It doesn't approach disk speed, but Exabyte says thatrather than tens of seconds, it will take just a matter of seconds.andM;Exabyte claims an average access time of 85 seconds, which would reduce thetime by a factor of five to 10.andP;  Exabyte sells the EXB-8200SX to resellersfor $1,715.andM;andgt;Reliability.andP;  &quot;As far as reliability, both 4mm and 8mm work,&quot; said MichaelPeterson, president of Peripheral Strategies Inc., a market research firm inSanta Barbara, Calif.andP;  &quot;Eight millimeter has a longer track record, with160,000 units sold, but 4mm is coming up fast, at 60,000 units.&quot;andM;One vendor that sells products in both markets believes the competition andlow prices in the DAT market spell trouble for Exabyte.andP;  &quot;Exabyte's in deeptrouble because DAT technology is clearly overtaking it,&quot; said the vendor,who declined to be identified.andP;  &quot;The company can't keep up with theinnovations of the multiple DAT vendors.&quot;andM;But don't count Exabyte out, observers cautioned.andP;  The 8mm-tape maker has aninstalled base that should serve it well.andP;  -- By Emily Kay</TEXT></DOC>
