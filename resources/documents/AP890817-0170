Another meeting gone awry.   Hours later, at a new place, he explained.   ``Police came to my house and arrested me. They held me 10 days.I'm still under investigation. I'm afraid my work unit may fire mebecause of it. I want to leave the country.''   There was quiet defiance in his manner _ defiance of the officialline, as expressed in the People's Daily, that China's young peopleshould ``uphold the Communist Party leadership, wholeheartedly servethe people and struggle hard'' and that they should renounce``bourgeois-liberal'' _ meaning Western _ culture.   On another night, more than 100 people, mostly in their 20s,gathered at a private bar for an ear-thumping, rock 'n' roll party.   So much for renouncing bourgeois-liberal culture.   Although swept off Tiananmen Square by the army the night of June3-4, the student democracy movement now is an undercurrent, roilingout of sight of officialdom.   Two months into the Communist Party's biggest purge in more thana decade, a final effort by China's aging revolutionaries topreserve their Marxist-Maoist dream, the younger generation hastuned the government out, quietly ignoring a re-education programlaunched after Tiananmen.   Many Chinese foreigners get to talk to, including some over 30,say they did not bother to watch the latest government televisiondocumentary on the seven-week student movement that the governmentdenounces as counter-revolutionary.   Discreetly, many seek out foreigners in Beijing for informationor just to talk.   A shopkeeper, tossing a basin of water out his door and seeing aforeigner, beckoned: ``Please come in and have some tea.''   A park worker, walking home after an ideological study sessionthat claimed the West was trying to colonize China, sat on a benchnext to a foreigner and struck up a conversation.   A young woman selling clothing eagerly pulled a foreigner intoher tiny stall.   Like the others, she brought up June 3-4.   ``The government says no one died in Tiananmen Square. But wehear on the Voice of America that many people died. We don't believeour own government.   ``Can you tell me what is true?''   The news that went out around the world from Beijing that nightand the days following was that the government sent an estimated150,000 soldiers into Beijing to crush the students' democracymovement. Hundreds, possibly thousands of people, were killed in twodays of street fighting between soldiers with tanks and guns andcivilians with stones and Molotov cocktails.   The Chinese have other questions when they meet up withforeigners: Is it true student leader Wang Dan has been arrested?(He was arrested July 2 but the government did not announce it untilAug. 17.) How many student leaders escaped? (Fewer than a dozen.)Will President Bush impose more sanctions on China? (He says no.)   They also turn to foreigners to pour out bitterness they dare notexpress to a fellow Chinese.   A taxi driver: ``China is still ruled by emperors.'' Told to anunsympathetic ear, that remark could mean police interrogation and ablack mark in his file.   In the aftermath of Tiananmen, the government arrested thousandsof people, executed at least 12 and sentenced others to life inprison. It has terrorized the intellectual community by purging themost open-minded and most creative government advisers, writers andacademics.   (Li Lu, a 23-year-old student leader who has fled China, toldreporters Aug. 17 in Geneva, where he had addressed a U.N. humanrights panel, that 120,000 people had been arrested since June andthat some of them had been secretly executed. ``Most of the Chinesepeople continue to support the students,'' Li said. ``They give meevery kind of information. For security reasons, I cannot name thesources but the information is reliable.'')   The government has installed cameras along streets throughoutBeijing, their long necks occasionally swiveling from side to side.Three cameras watch the Friendship Store, which the government runsfor foreigners.   It has hung banners praising the ``great and glorious'' CommunistParty from hotels and government buildings and filled the newspaperswith editorials and columns maintaining that the democracy movementwas a Western-aided plot to turn China into a ``vassal state.''   It has televised book burnings, with officials setting fire tohundreds of books said to be reactionary or obscene.   But the government has failed to get all the people to listen, tobelieve or to participate.   The party's anti-bourgeois liberalism campaign is being ignoredlike a television show with the sound turned off.   Ten years of contact with the outside world, encouraged by seniorleader Deng Xiaoping's policy of promoting rapid development, havechanged China to the point where old totalitarian methods no longerwork to the fullest, as they did in the past.   Deng was respected as a reformer when he began his rule in 1978.But now, as millions of people nationwide are required to study hiswords, and movies and books about him proliferate, his prestigecould hardly be lower.   ``We just string together words from Deng's speech,'' a Chinesereporter said of his office's mandatory twice-weekly sessions tostudy Deng. Each person must make a statement, he said, but ``it'snot necessary to be enthusiastic.''   Small numbers of Chinese in Beijing meet in secret to discussgoals of democratic change, but say they have no plans for immediateaction.   In most cases, derision or anonymous defiance are the weapons now.   ``All of these things will be answered for,'' reads a piece ofgraffito spray-painted in English on a subway station. Police,apparently uncomprehending, have not washed it off.   At viewings of a new movie lionizing Deng as a young Red Armyguerrilla leader, audiences laugh when the young Deng declares:``What I say goes.''   ``Even back then he had to have his way,'' said woman who saw themovie.   After the top leaders pledged to wipe out corruption, it turnedout that the sons and daughters of some of them were involved. Aditty began making the rounds about them: ``The junior official willwear handcuffs, the middle-level official will make a self-criticismand the top guy will make a report.''   Even university students, who are now being watched more closelyand given more intensive political education than any other group,have dared to show their anger over being punished for protesting.   One night in late July, several hundred graduates at BeijingUniversity, a center of dissidence in the spring, gathered on campusand began beating pots and pans, shouting sarcastically, ``Long livethe Communist Party.''   The government caught the sarcasm and withheld the diploma of thealleged ringleader.   More than anything, ordinary Chinese look to foreign investmentand foreign ideas to open up their one-party system to allow freedomof speech and the press.   ``You are our hope,'' a student told a foreigner.   Said the park worker to the foreigner on the park bench: ``Weneed foreign governments to help us make revolution.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 27</NOTE></DOC>
