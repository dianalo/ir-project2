Levine insider-trading case pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges.    The pleas bring to six the number of individuals convicted in the Levine case, which has since been dwarfed by the related Ivan F. Boesky matter.    Robert M. Wilkis, 37 years old, a former investment banker at Lazard, pleaded guilty to four felony charges. Randall D. Cecola, 25, currently a Harvard Business School student and a former junior financial analyst at Lazard, pleaded guilty to two criminal counts of filing false tax returns related to options trading at the investment firm. Mr. Cecola also settled, without admitting wrongdoing, related Securities and Exchange Commission charges that he tipped Mr. Wilkis to inside information that Mr. Wilkis forwarded to Mr. Levine.    Sentencing for Mr. Wilkis was set for Feb. 9 and for Mr. Cecola the next day. Mr. Wilkis faces a maximum 20 years in prison and fines totaling $850,000. He earlier surrendered to the government about $2.5 million in profits from illegal insider trading, his attorney, Gary Naftalis, said. Mr. Cecola faces a maximum of six years imprisonment and total fines of $500,000.    The U.S. attorney's office said Mr. Wilkis is cooperating with a continuing criminal investigation. Mr. Wilkis also figures in the Boesky case as a corroborating witness to Mr. Levine's alleged profit-sharing pact with Mr. Boesky.    Mr. Levine faces as much as 20 years in prison and fines of $610,000, at his own sentencing next year; he agreed last June to give up $11.6 million in illegal trading profits. Mr. Boesky, who is to plead guilty to a single felony count, agreed to pay $100 million in penalties and surrendered profits in his civil case.    Mr. Wilkis was employed at Lazard from November 1979 to May 1985, when he moved to securities firm E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. and was named a first vice president in the mergers and acquisitions department. He resigned from Hutton last summer. Mr. Cecola was at Lazard from September 1983 to July 1985. He starts his last semester at Harvard Business School next month.    Messrs. Wilkis and Cecola entered their pleas in barely audible voices before U.S. District Judge Peter K. Leisure.    &quot;I was recruited by Dennis Levine to reveal to him confidential information&quot; from Lazard, Mr. Wilkis told the judge. Waiving his right to indictment, Mr. Wilkis pleaded guilty to securities fraud, mail fraud, tax evasion and bringing in $10,000 cash to the U.S. from the Cayman Islands without reporting it. Of his tax-evasion plea, Mr. Wilkis explained: &quot;I had extremely high profits in 1985,&quot; but didn't report more than $2.5 million in income on that year's income tax return, thus shaving $1.2 million off his tax bill.    The waiver of indictment is not unusual for an insider-trading case. Though a guilty plea in the absence of an indictment is the same as a trial conviction, the maneuver saves the government time and money. A defendant, in turn, takes this course in hopes that the immediate plea and subsequent cooperation will bode well at sentencing.    Mr. Wilkis, who met Mr. Levine when both worked at Citibank in the 1970s, admitted in the securities fraud count to making $137,268 and helping Mr. Levine make $200,076, by using nonpublic information from Lazard concerning Chicago-based consumer products company Chicago Pacific Corp.'s 1984 takeover bid for Textron Inc., a Providence, R.I.-based aerospace, industrial products and financial services firm. The transaction was one of 21 in which Mr. Wilkis leaked confidential information from Lazard to Mr. Levine, according to the earlier SEC charges.    Mr. Wilkis also admitted to mail fraud in the purchase in March 1985 of stock in American Natural Resources Co., an energy concern that was being taken over by Houston-based Coastal Corp., based on information Mr. Levine received from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., where he was a managing director. Mr. Wilkis made $300,232 in that transaction.    Mr. Naftalis said his client has fully cooperated with the government since June. &quot;This is a tragic day for Robert Wilkis and his family,&quot; the lawyer said, adding that Mr. Wilkis feels &quot;great remorse.&quot;    Mr. Cecola didn't admit any Levine involvement. His criminal pleas referred to $66,342 in unreported trading profits he made in an account at Lazard in a friend's name. He told Judge Leisure that Lazard wouldn't allow him to trade in stock options, but he wanted to anyway to support his mother and younger brothers.    However, in the related SEC complaint filed yesterday, Mr. Cecola was charged with trading on and tipping Mr. Wilkis to the Chicago Pacific takeover bid, a tip Mr. Wilkis then forwarded to Mr. Levine. He also was charged with trading in April 1985 on a Wilkis tip about a tender offer for Houston Natural Gas Corp. by InterNorth Inc. The two concerns are now known as Enron Corp., a Houston-based energy concern. Mr. Cecola, in turn, later gave Mr. Wilkis an updated tip on the transaction, the SEC charged.    In addition, Mr. Cecola was charged with misappropriating confidential information on four other transactions while at Lazard and making $15,000 in trading profits.    Though he didn't admit or deny the SEC charges, Mr. Cecola agreed to disgorge $21,800 in trading profits, the SEC said. Mr. Cecola said after his court appearance yesterday that he was relieved to have the allegations behind him. &quot;This will hopefully let Randy get on with the rest of his life,&quot; Mr. Cecola's lawyer, Alan Kaufman, said. </TEXT></DOC>
