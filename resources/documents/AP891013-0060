At a Dinkins fund-raiser Thursday night, Allen said he found``no malice or racism'' in comments made by Mason that were printedin the Village Voice and elsewhere two weeks ago. Mason was forcedto resign as Rudolph Giuliani's honorary campaign chairman over theincident.   The Village Voice quoted Mason as saying Dinkins looked like amodel without a job and that there ``was a sick Jewish problem ofvoting for a black man.'' Dinkins is black.   Mason also reportedly referred to Dinkins as a ``fancy shvartzewith a mustache.'' Shvartze is a Yiddish term for blacks that isgenerally derogatory.   ``I think that he's in no way racially prejudiced, and that hewas just joking, and these are the same jokes that he's alwaysmade, and that the press was pious and foolish and, you know, thathe got a raw deal,'' Allen said of Mason, star of ABC's ``ChickenSoup.''   ``He was just joking in the same style that he always jokes,''Allen said. ``Shvartze'' could be pejorative, he said, but ``Idon't think it's pejorative in this case.''   He also defended Mason's suggestion that Jews would vote forDinkins out of guilt. ``I don't know whether it's Jews or blacks,but I think that people make decisions out of guilt as amotivation.''   Dinkins stood by as Allen spoke to reporters at the$1,000-a-head fund-raiser at the home of Arthur Krim, chairman ofOrion Pictures. The smile left his face and he replied curtly:``I've made all the comments I intend to make on that subject.   ``Frankly, I would prefer to talk about crime and drugs andhousing and homelessness. And I would hope that I could somehow orother interest the media in these issues as well,'' he said.   Allen said he had met Mason once, for only 30 seconds. A formerstand-up comic himself, the director featured a gaggle of Borshtbelt gagmen similar to Mason in his film ``Broadway Danny Rose.''   Another comedian, Billy Crystal, made a face when asked aboutMason's comments in a USA Today interview. ``I think Jackie'sremarks are Jackie's remarks,'' he said.   He did say he thought Mason should have known better, and headapted a basic rule of stand-up comedy to apply to politics: ``Ifyou're going to be a spokesperson, know the room.''</TEXT></DOC>
