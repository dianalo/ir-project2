The cells were labeled with monoclonal antibodiesthat were specific for each type of T cell. Significant changes aftertherapy were decreases in the proportion of T-helper/inducer cells, pan-Tcells, and in the ratio of T-helper/inducer to T-suppressor/cytotoxiccells. There was an increase in the percentage of T-suppressor/cytotoxiccells. When the site of the primary cancer was considered, genitourinarycancer and cancer of the head and neck both showed a decreased percentageof T-helper/inducer cells and a reduced ratio of T-helper/inducer toT-suppressor/cytotoxic cells. The percentage of pan-T cells in head andneck cancer and the ratio of T-helper/inducer to T-suppressor/cytotoxiccells in breast cancer were decreased. The percentage of T-helper cellswas particularly decreased by radiation therapy in advanced stages ofcancer, in higher grade tumors, and in larger tumors. The absolute numbersof various T-cell subsets were decreased in all groups.</TEXT></DOC>
