ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The rules of the mergers game may be changing,but it was clear Tuesday there's no shortage of players _ even ifthere is turmoil on Wall Street.   While UAL Corp. executives were trying to appease big banks andsalvage a planned buyout of the parent of United Airlines, a muchsmaller carrier, Mesa Airlines Inc., received a takeover bid fromStateswest Airlines Inc.   Stateswest _ like Mesa a small regional carrier _ declined toreveal the terms. But coming as the stock market continued tofluctuate _ the Dow Jones industrial average closed down more than18 points after seesawing throughout Tuesday's session _ the offershowed there's still confidence in the takeover business.   In the UAL deal, the management-led investor group seeking tobuy the airline restructured its offer and lowered its price to$5.62 billion from $6.75 billion, trying to persuade Japanese banksto help finance the takeover.   News that banks would not back the deal contributed to the stockmarket's tremendous slide on Friday, when the Dow Jones averageplunged 190 points. It also raised concerns that takeovers hadskidded to a halt.   On Monday, one possible takeover bid became a casualty of themarket volatility as developer Donald Trump withdrew his $7.5billion proposed offer for AMR Inc., the parent of AmericanAirlines.   Andrew Geller, who follows AMR for Provident National Bank inPhiladephia, said the snag in the UAL offer probably helped Trumpdecide to shelve his proposal.   Observers said the takeover business would survive the UALproblems and the tumult on Wall Street. But billion-dollar buyoutswere expected to be more difficult to accomplish and prospectivedeals were likely to undergo the same kind of scrutiny as the UALoffer.   Bankers have become cautious because companies such as CampeauCorp. and Resorts International Inc. have been unable to make theinterest payments following takeovers.   Campeau, for example, ran into trouble because its FederatedDepartment Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. units did not havethe kind of sales that Chairman Robert Campeau anticipated when hewent heavily into debt to buy the two retailers.   Without those sales, Campeau did not have enough cash to pay hisbills.   Bankers want to ensure that a company will be able to handle theheavy debt load undertaken in a buyout and ``are looking at acertain kind of credit risk,'' Geller said.   UAL's bankers are concerned about a falloff in air travel. IfUnited does less business it would not have the cash needed toservice its debt, and its assets _ particularly its fleet ofairplanes _ would be worth less because of the reduced demand.   By lowering its price, the group seeking UAL is lowering thepayments it would have to make after the buyout and thereby easingits cash flow requirements.   While all deals will be examined closely, some prospectivebuyers will have an easier time than others.   For instance, analysts say, if KohlbergKravis Roberts andamp; Co. werepresenting its $24.53 billion bid for RJR Nabisco Inc. before bankstoday, it likely would win approval for its proposal faster than ifit were buying an airline like United.   The reason is that RJR Nabisco has a business that is considered``recession proof.'' Even if consumers become cautious, they'llstill buy the food and tobacco company's products and its cash flowwould likely be steady.   Put another way, consumers might forgo expensive vacations andput a crimp in an airline's cash flow, but they would not stopbuying Oreo cookies or Camel filters.</TEXT></DOC>
