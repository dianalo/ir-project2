The pope restated his and the Roman Catholic Church's oppositionto all forms of racial discrimination, adding that a change in thestructures of discrimination requires ``a change of hearts.''   The 10-member delegation was a joint group of the South AfricanCouncil of Churches and the Southern African Catholic Bishops'Conference.   In their address to the pope, the church officials said recentgovernment actions in South Africa have ``resulted in bitterness,resentment and frustration _ feelings which can easily lead toviolence.''   They said an emergency meeting of church leaders will be held inJohannesburg on May 30.   ``The emergency convocation will develop effective non-violentaction to put pressure on the South African government to sit atthe negotiating table and for the church to refuse to collaboratewith the unjust system,'' the delegation said in a news statement.   At a news conference, Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, said thepope was making an ``eloquent statement'' by not visiting SouthAfrica during his tour of four African nations next September.   ``It speaks to the perpetrators of apartheid, it speaks to thevictims,'' he said.   Tutu called for tougher sanctions by Western nations against theSouth African government.   ``If we do not apply sanctions, or if sanctions are ineffective,what is effective?,'' he said. ``If you say sanctions will fail orhave failed, than you can tell us what will succeed...then the verylast last option available is violence and we have consistentlyexpressed our opposition to violence... So we say, `help us.' ''   He criticized Japan for its trade links with South Africa.   ``We hope that the Japanese would be embarassed that they havestepped into a vacuum,'' he said. ``I hope the Japanese willremember that they were insulted in South Africa when thegovernment was enforcing racial classification. Because they wantedthe Japanese as traders, they called them `honorary Europeans.' Iwould hope they would get so upset, they would go back home.''</TEXT></DOC>
