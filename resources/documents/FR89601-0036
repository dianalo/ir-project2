McEntee,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Under Secretary, Bureau of Export Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Summary</ITAG>Pursuant to the February 9, 1989 Recommended Decision and order of theAdministrative Law Judge, which Decision and Order is attached hereto andaffirmed in principal part by me, Hon Kwan Yu, individually and doing businessas Seed H.K. Ltd., both with an address of 7/F Cheung Kong Building, 661Kings Road, North Point, Hong Kong, is, and the Respondents are collectively,assessed a civil penalty in the amount of $35,000, to be paid within 30days of the date hereof, and denied for a period two years from the datehereof all privileges of participating, directly or indirectly, in anymanner or capacity, in any transaction involving commodities or technicaldata exported from the United States, in whole or in part, or to be exported,or that are otherwise subject to the regulations (14 CFR Parts 768 through700); provided, however, that commencing from the date of the payment ofthe civil penalty herein assessed the denial of export privileges set forthshall be suspended for the balance of the two year term, and shall be terminatedat the end of such period, provided that Respondents have committed nofurther violations of the Act, the Regulations, of the Final Order enteredin this proceeding.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>In the Recommended Decision and order of February 9, 1989, the AdministrativeLaw Judge (ALJ) apparently inadvertently misspoke himself in paragraphIII of his order. In that Paragraph, the ALJ provided that the two yeardenial period provided for in Paragraph II would be suspended for threeyears. This provision is not in keeping with the general suspension provisionsand is inconsistent with the rational advanced for the penalty by the ALJon page 12 of his Recommended Decison and Order. This final Decision andOrder modifies the ALJ's Order in that respect.Paragraph III of the ALJ's Recommended Decision and Order also providesthat the suspension of the denial of export privileges shall commence uponthe date of this final action. In view of the fact that a civil fine hasbeen assessed and that the ALJ has held that the suspension will be inaffect only so long as, <T3>inter alia, </T3>there is no violation of the final Order entered inthis proceeding, it is more appropriate for the suspension to begin uponpayment of the fine by the Respondents. This final Order reflects thismodification of the ALJ's Recommended Order.One further issue must be disposed of in this case. That issue involvesthe Department's contention_raised by brief in this proceeding and by Motionfor Reconsideration in <T3>In re Behar</T3>, 53 FR 48666 (Dec. 2, 1988)_that in a matter submittedto the ALJ for resolution pursuant to a consent agreement between the Departmentand the Respondent, it is inappropriate for the Administrative Law Judgeto make a finding of violation of the Export Administration Act beforeimposing penalties for past action. In <T3>Behar</T3> this office held, as quoted in full on page 3 of the attachedRecommended Decision and Order of the ALJ, that while a Respondent maybe free to maintain in a consent pleading that the imposition of penaltiesdoes not necessarily maintain an admission of a violation of the Act, wherethere is to be a penalty imposed, whether a denial period with respectto export privileges, a fine, or both, there must be some finding by theUnder Secretary_and hence the ALJ_of a violation of the Act to supportthe imposition of that penalty. In challenging that holding, the Departmentcites section II(i)(2) of the Export Administration Act which providesthat ``nothing in subsections (c), (d), (f), (h), or (h) limits * * * theauthority to compromise and settle administrative proceedings with respectto violations of [the] Act or any regulation, order, or license issuedunder [the] Act * * *.'' The Departmental also cites some general authoritieson compromise and settlement of claims, and relies specifically on <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>ITT Continental Baking Company</T3>, 420 U.S. 160 (1975). In that case,the court made the general observation that consent degrees are like contracts,``are arrived at by negotiations between the parties and often admit noviolation of law * * *.'' <T3>Id</T3> at 236. Counsel also cites <T3>Ford Motor Company </T3>v. <T3>Federal Trade Commission</T3>, 547 F2d 954 (6th Cir. 1976)_for theproposition that the principal purpose of a consent order is to avoid fact-findingand the ajudicatory process_and Coch, <T3>Administrative Law and Practice</T3>, West Publishing Company, 1985,section 5.81_for the proposition that an agency in accepting a consentdegree by the parties need not support the order by any fact-finding orconclusions of law.The Department's arguments are correct insofar as they go, but superficialwith respect to the real issue. To take Department's authority in reverseorder, the Coch treatise does not stand for the proposition that the agencymust not support an order by fact-finding or conclusions of law. With respectto <T3>Ford Motor Company </T3>v. <T3>Federal Trade Commission</T3>, <T3>supra</T3>, there are many purposes for a consent order, only one ofwhich is the avoidance of fact-finding and the ajudicatory process. Finally,<T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>ITT Continental Baking Company</T3>, <T3>supra</T3>, is certainly correct that consent agreements between partiesoften admit to no violation of law. However, that simple statement is notdispositive of the issue of whether or not a tribunal, whether judicialor administrative, may impose penalties absent a finding of violation ofa particular law or regulation.The principal starting point for a discussion of the law as it relatesto consent decrees is the Meat Packers Consent Decree of 1920. That consentdecree related to alleged violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act andthe Clayton Act. In <T3>Swift andamp; Company </T3>v. <T3>the United States</T3>, 276 U.S. 311 (1927), one of the Respondentsattempted to vacate the consent decree entered into in 1920 by itself andothers. The consent decree had been entered on the same day as the filingof the original complaint by the Government and general denials by theRespondents. The consent decree expressly provided that the Respondentsdid not admit to violation of either of the Acts involved, but did providethat the Government's allegations were sufficient to state a cause of actionunder the two Acts. The decree then went on to enjoin the Respondents,by consent, from certain future actions. In the Motion to Vacate, Swiftattacked the decree upon several grounds, the main one being that the courtlacked jurisdiction to render an enforceable injunction because there wasno case or controversy within the meaning of Article III, Section 2 ofthe Constitution. The argument advanced was that since there had been noproof of facts constituting a violation to overcome the Respondent's generaldenial, indeed since the consent decree had specifically stipulated thatthere would be no such finding, technically the Court and Government petitionerhad abandoned all charges that the Respondents had violated the law. Thus,Swift argued that the decree was null and void for want of adjudication.In rejecting the Respondent's claim, a unanimous court, by Brandeis J.,held that the Respondent's argument ``ignores the fact that a suit foran injunction deals primarily, not with past violations, but with threatenedfuture ones; and that an injunction may issue to prevent future wrong,although no rights had been violated.'' <T3>Id</T3> at 326. The court implicitly accepted the claim of the petitionersthat an imposition of a penalty for past acts must be based upon a findingof wrongdoing. Since the consent decree that the Department has advancedin both <T3>Behar</T3> and the case at bar would have imposed penalties based onpast acts rather than the approval of an injunctive order relative to futureaction, the Department's claim falls under the rationale of <T3>Swift. </T3>Section 11(i)(2) of the Export Administration Act merelygives the Department the right to compromise and settle administrativeproceedings, it does not mandate that the <T3>Swift</T3> rationale be rejected. Indeed, as in anti-trust litigation,the Department might conceivably enter into a consent agreement with aRespondent which would call for the Department's abandonment of claimsrelative to past action in return for an injunctive agreement with theRespondents relative to future action.A case which relies on <T3>Swift</T3> is <T3>Securities and Exchange Commission </T3>v. <T3>Dennett</T3>, 429 F2d 1303, 10th Circuit 1970. In that case a defendanthad challenged not a penalty for past action, and not even the generalterms of the injunction to which he had agreed relative to future activity,but rather, he had challenged the wording of the final order of the courtwhich apparently implied misconduct on his part. The Court held as followsat 1304:<ITAG tagnum="21">We gleen from defendant's brief that he is agreeable to the generalinjunction requiring him to obey the law but objects to the specifics ofthe injunction granted because it implies misconduct. The judgment grantedthe relief sought in the complaint. It says that the defendant does notadmit to the allegations of the complaint. In affect, we have a plea of<T3>nolo contendre</T3> and a judgment pursuant thereto. If the defendantis innocent of the charges, as he insists, he had full opportunity to contestthem. He chose not to do so and is in no position to object on the groundsthat the injunction was specific rather than general.</ITAG>Thus, even in a case where under the <T3>Swift</T3> doctrine there need not have been a finding a misconduct,the court was free to find the same. The parties to a consent agreementcan always go forward on the merits if they do not like this risk. Thereare many reasons in an Export Administration case for agreeing to a penalty,even if it involves a finding by the Under Secretary of a violation inorder to impose that penalty. Recently a Respondent has been denied exportprivileges for 35 years. In the face of that possibility, a future Respondentmight feel that it is in his or her best interest to agree to a stipulatedfinding upon an agreement by Departmental counsel to recommend the impositionof a lesser penalty. Finally, <T3>Janus Films, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Miller</T3>, 801 F2d 578 (2nd Cir. 1986) explains that one must differentiatebetween suits involving the public interest and those involving only privateinterests in dealing with consent agreements. It is axiomatic that in asuit between private litigants the parties are free to frame consent decreesin whatever form is agreeable to themselves, subject only to the limitationof contracting for illegal purposes. In cases involving the public interestthat is not the case. ``The court must be satisfied of the fairness ofthe settlement.'' <T3>Id</T3> at 582. In dealing with a national security program, the violationof the statute and regulations relating thereto carrying with them notonly the possibility of administrative sanction but criminal penalty aswell, it is incumbent upon this office to have some showing by Departmentalcounsel of what its case was based on, and to impose a penalty for pastaction only if a fair reading of the unchallenged submission constitutesa violation of the Act or Regulations. While a Respondent is free to agreethat the evidence submitted to support the settlement between the partiesneed not be tested by the ajudicatory process, the evidence is necessaryif the Under Secretary is asked to impose a penalty based on past action.Thus the holding of this office in the <T3>Behar</T3> decision is reaffirmed. Finally, in this case the ALJ recommends imposition of a penalty whichhad apparently been agreed to by the parties before the consent processbroke down. The Department complains that the penalty is not severe enoughgiven the fact that it has been imposed pursuant to a default proceedingrather than a consent proceeding. The argument lacks merit. Presumably,the Department would not have agreed to propose an unreasonably lenientpenalty to the ALJ in the consent proceeding, thus it can hardly complainnow that the penalty it had agreed to propose is in fact unreasonable.That being the case, and the penalty not appearing unreasonble on its face,this Office is not inclined to modify the same.<ITAG tagnum="84">Order </ITAG>A. The decision in <T3>In re Behar</T3>, 53 FR 48666 (December 2, 1988), is reaffirmed. B. On February 9, 1989 the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) entered his RecommendedDecision and Order in the captioned matter. That Decision and Order, acopy of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof has been referredto me for final action. Subject to the following modifications, I herebyaffirm the Recommended Decision and Order of the ALJ: 1. Suspension of the two year denial period shall begin only after thepayment in full of the $35,000 fine assessed in this case; and 2. The suspension of the denial period shall begin upon the payment ofthe $35,000 fine as above and shall be in effect for the balance of thetwo year period of denial provided the Respondents, or either of them,commit no further violations of the Act, the Regulations, or this finalOrder in this proceeding. This constitutes final agency action in this matter.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date March 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Paul Freedenberg, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Under Secretary Bureau of Export Administration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Appearance for Respondent Stanley J.

Ltd, began with the issuance February9, 1988 of a charging letter by the Office of Export Enforcement (``theAgency''), Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce.This charging letter was issued under the authority of the Export AdministrationAct of 1979 (50 U.S.C.A. app. 2401-2420), as amended (the Act''), and theExport Administration Regulations (``the Regulations'') \1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Act was reauthorized and amended by the Export AdministrationAmendments Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-64, 99 Stat. 120 (July 12, 1985), andamended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-418,102 Stat. 1107 (August 23, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28">The Regulations, formerly codified at 15 CFR Parts 368-399, were redesignatedas 15 CFR Parts 768-799, effective October 1, 1988 (53 FR 37751, September28, 1988). </ITAG>The charging letter alleged that Respondents had violated Sections 387.4and 387.6 of the Regulations in 1982-84 by reexporting six U.S.-origincomputers from Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China (P.R.C.) withoutthe required U.S. authorization. \2\<NOTE/> On May 16, 1988 the original February 9, 1988 charging letterwas amended by increasing from six to seven the number of such allegedanauthorized reexports. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ As the charging letter noted (at 1 n.l), the 1982-84 periodduring which the alleged violations occurred included a time during 1983when the Act had lapsed and the Regulations were maintained in effect pursuantto the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50U.S.C. 1701-1706 (1982)).An Order of September 30, 1988 declared Respondents to be in default since,although they had been granted two extensions for filing an answer, theyhad not filed any. Accordingly, the Order of September 30 directed theAgency to make the submission provided for default cases by andSection; 388.8of the Regulations.The Agency instead submitted a Consent Agreement, under andSection; 388.17of the Regulations, signed on behalf of Respondents by their Counsel (Agency'sOctober 28, 1988 Response). In the Consent Agreement, the parties agreedto settle this matter by Respondent's paying a $35,000 civil penalty andaccepting a two-year denial of U.S. export privileges that would be suspended.By an Order of December 7, 1988, this Tribunal directed the Agency to submitevidence that would support its charge that Respondents had violated theRegulations, citing <T3>Behar, </T3>53 FR 48666 (December 2, 1988). In <T3>Behar, </T3>which also concerned a consent agreement under the Actand the Regulations, the Under Secretary for Export Administration statedas follows (53 FR 48666, 48667).<ITAG tagnum="21">[I]n the imposition of civil penalties under the Export AdministrationAct and Regulations, a respondent may admit to certain facts for the purposesof accepting the imposition of a penalty which will bring the matter toa close, while maintaining that the admitted facts do not necessarily constituteviolation of the act of [sic] the regulations. However, the ALJ, as inthe case of a plea of <T3>nolo contendere, </T3>is free to find that the facts thus admittedconstitute violations of the Export Administration Act or Regulations.Indeed, the Under Secretary's authority for imposing civil penalties insuch cases is based on the finding of a violation * * *. For Export AdministrationAct cases in which there will be the imposition of a penalty, whether adenial period with respect to export privileges, a fine, or both, theremust be some finding by the Under Secretary of a violation to support theimposition of the penalty.</ITAG>In reply to the Order of December 7, the Agency stated that it had fileda motion with the Under Secretary for reconsideration of that part of <T3>Behar </T3>pertinent to this case (Agency's December 28, 1988 Response3). The Agency argued that, until it obtains a ruling on that motion in<T3>Behar</T3>, it would be ``premature for it to file the requested evidence''in this case (<T3>id</T3>.), and accordingly it requested a stay in the Order of December7 until it obtains such a ruling (<T3>id. </T3>4). This Tribunal, in an Order of January 9, 1989, denied the requested stay,and instead scheduled a January 17, 1989 informal hearing. The nature andpurpose of this hearing, and the reason for directing that it be a stepin resolving this case, were explained as follows (January 17 Order 1-2).<ITAG tagnum="21">For this case, and future consent submissions, the following policyand practice is adopted. This approach is essentially similar to that whichexisted under Hearing Commissioner Levinson and which were followed * ** in the 1973 and 1974 era. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Upon receipt of consent agreements, an informal, tape recorded, hearingwill be scheduled, usually within 10-15 days, at which the representativesof both parties may be present. It is not expected that testimony willnormally be taken, however, a ``paper case'' consisting of documents, diagrams,records, statements and the like, along with the explanations of the representativeswill be received and made a part of the record. Following receipt of thesematerials, the Administrative Law Judge's action, with the record, willbe forwarded to the Under Secretary for the 30-day statutory review andfinal Agency action. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The history of review of settlement proposals by this Office reflectsalmost unanimous concurrence with those submissions. It is not expectedthat this will change. On the other hand, this Office and the Under Secretaryeach have the statutory responsibility to take informed actions. Not merelyrubber stamp * * *. The review should be meaningful. Without some record* * * it cannot be. (footnote omitted)</ITAG>Counsel for Respondents filed a letter stating that Respondents had instructedCounsel not to attend the January 17 hearing, indicating that ``budgetaryconstraints'' were the reason (Respondents' January 17, 1989 Letter). Respondentshave not participated in this proceeding since the filing of that letter.Agency Counsel did appear at the January 17 informal hearing, but declinedto present evidence of Respondents' alleged violations. Agency Counselfiled a written statement setting forth its position as follows (Agency'sJanuary 17, 1989 Statement 3).<ITAG tagnum="21">As agreed to by both the Department and Yu, the Consent Agreementdoes not address the issue of whether Yu in fact violated the Regulations.Accordingly, in the context of the review of the Consent Agreement in thismatter and as a matter of law, the Department does not believe that thatissue should be the subject of further discussion.</ITAG>Based upon Agency Counsel's declining to present evidence of the allegedviolations, this Tribunal issued an Order of January 19, 1989 rejectingthe proposed settlement between the parties. The Order of January 19 furtherreinstated the Order of September 30, which had declared Respondents tobe in default, and again directed the Agency to make the submission providedfor default cases. The Agency then filed a motion for default that set forth evidence to supportits allegations against Respondents and proposed a ten-year denial of Respondents'U.S. export privileges (Agency's January 30, 1989 Motion). In filing thismotion, the Agency expressly stated that the Agency in no way concededany concurrence with this Tribunal's basis for rejecting the Consent Agreement(<T3>id</T3>. 4). Discussion The Agency' evidence documented its charges that in 1982-84 Respondentsobtained seven computers from their U.S. manufacturer and reexported themto the P.R.C. without the required U.S. authorization. Five computers wereof one type, and two of another. For the five computers, the Agency's evidence included Respondent Yu'sMarch 14, 1983 order for them from their U.S. manufacturer (Agency Exhibit(hereinafter ``Exh.'') 4), and the manufacturer's shipping document forthem, dated April 7, 1983, from the United States to Hong Kong (<T3>id.</T3>). The manufacturer shipped these computers to Respondentsunder a distribution license (Agency Exh. 11, 12, 13).     From April 1983 through January 1984, according to the Agency's presentation,Respondents reexported these five computers to five different P.R.C. endusers. Here the Agency's evidence consisted of the U.S. manufacturer'sreports of its investigation of the situation (Agency Exh. 11, 13) andof parts of applications for U.S authorizations, made after the reexports,in which each of the P.R.C. and users apparently affirmed its possessionof one of these computers (Agency Exh. 6-10). The Agency showed that eachof the five reexports required U.S. authorization for national securityreasons (although a properly filed application would have benefited froma presumption of approval) (Agency Exh. 5), and showed that Respondentshad not obtained the required authorization (Agency Exh. 14). The Agency argued that each of these five reexports violated andSection;387.6of the Regulations, which proscribes unauthorized exports and reexports.The Agency contended that in making each of these five reexports Respondentsviolated also Section 387.4, which proscribes participating in an exportor reexport knowing, or having reason to know, that it is unauthorized.To show Respondents' knowledge, or reason to know, that the reexports wereunauthorized, the Agency cited the invoices billing Respondents for thefive computers; each invoice stated that the computer was licensed by theUnited States for ultimate destination in Hong Kong, and diversion contraryto U.S. law was prohibited (Agency Exh. 6-10). The Agency cited also thecertification that Respondents signed in order to become a consignee onthe U.S. manufacturer's distribution license under which the five computerswere shipped to Respondents; in the certification, Respondents agreed tocomply with the Regulations (Agency Exh. 12). As to the first of the remaining two computers of the other type that werethe subject of the charging letter, the Agency introduced Respondents'order, dated September 10, 1982 and addressed to the U.S. manufacturer(Agency Exh. 2(a)). The Agency presented also a manufacturer's shippingdocument, dated October 1, 1982, showing that the order was filled by ashipment to Respondents from a West European facility of the manufacturer(Agency Exh. 2(b)). To prove that Respondents subsequently reexported the computer to the P.R.C.at some point after December 4, 1982 (Agency Exh. 2(c)) and before sometime in January 1984 (Agency Exh. 13), the Agency introduced two documents.The first was a manufacturer's report of its investigation of the situation(Agency Exh. 13); and the second was part of an application for U.S. authorization,made after the reexport, in which the P.R.C. end user apparently affirmedits possession of the computer (Agency Exh. 2(d)). The Agency showed that reexport of the computer from Hong Kong to the P.R.C.required a U.S. authorization for national security reasons (although aproperly filed application would have benefited from a presumption of approval)(Agency Exh. 3), and showed that Respondents did not obtain the requiredauthorization (Agency Exh. 14). Therefore the Agency asserted that Respondents'reexport violated andSection;andSection;387.4 and 387.6 of the Regulations,the same two sections it named for the five reexports discussed above.To indicate that Respondents knew, or had reason to know, that the reexportwas unauthorized, the Agency cited a statement on the manufacturer's invoiceto Respondents to the effect that the United States had licensed the computer,ultimate destination Hong Kong, and diversion contrary to U.S. law wasprohibited (Agency Exh. 2(b)). The last of the reexports raised by the charging letter concerned the otherone of this second type of computer. According to a manufacturer's reportof its investigation of the situation that the Agency introduced (AgencyExh. 11), Respondents had obtained this computer from the manufacturerpursuant to a validated license authorizing its reexport to a particularP.R.C. end user, but in 1984 had instead reexported it to a different P.R.C.end user. Apparently the originally intended end user had decided againstbuying the computer (<T3>id.</T3>). The Agency again cited its evidence that reexport of this computer to theP.R.C. required U.S. authorization for national security reasons (although,as before, a properly filed application would have benefited from a presumptionof approval) (Agency Exh. 3). Further, the Agency cited the manufacturer'sreport to show that no authorization had been obtained for reexportingthe computer to that P.R.C. end user to which it was actually shipped (AgencyExh. 11). As with the other six reexports, the Agency charged a violationof both Sections 387.4 and 387.6. To show Respondents' knowledge, or reason to have knowledge, that the reexportwas unauthorized, the Agency noted that Respondents had received the computerinitially pursuant to a validated license, which indicated that at leastup to that point the computer had been subject to the Regulations. Thenthe Agency cited the evidence it advanced for its Section 387.4 chargefor the other six reexports, and argued that Respondents therefore knew,or had reason to know, that this reexport also required U.S. authorization,expecially since the computer was the same type as the computer that wasinvolved in one of these other reexports. Conclusion The evidence of record sustains the allegations of the May 16, 1988 amendedcharging letter that Respondents during 1982-84 reexported seven U.S.-origincomputers from Hong Kong to the P.R.C. without the U.S. authorization thatwas required. The record shows both that Respondents made these seven reexports,and also that Respondents knew, or had reason to know, that they lackeda U.S. authorization that was required. Thus each of these seven unauthorizedreexports violated Section 387.4 and Section 387.6 of the Regulations.For a sanction, the settlement arrived at in the parties' Consent Agreement_a$35,000 civil penalty and a suspended two-year denial of U.S. export privileges_isreasonable. The violations that Respondents committed are serious; butthe sanction proposed by the Agency in its default motion_ten years denialof U.S. export privileges with no suspension_seems unduly severe. The sanctionarrived at through the bargaining that produced the Consent Agreement isappropriate to serve the interests of justice here.   OrderI. Respondent Hon Kwan Yu, individually and doing business as RespondentSeed H.K. Ltd., is assessed a civil penalty of $35,000, to be paid withinthirty days of the date of the final Agency action.II. For a period of two years from the date of the final Agency action,as modified by the suspension set forth in paragraph III below, Respondents<ITAG tagnum="14">Hon Kwan Yu, individually and doing business as Seed H.K.

Commencing from the date that this Order becomes effective, the denialof export privileges set forth above shall be suspended, in accordancewith andSection;388.16 of the Regulations, for a period of three years commencingfrom the date that this Order becomes effective, and shall be terminatedat the end of such period, provided that Respondents have committed nofurther violation of the Act, the Regulations, or the final Order enteredin this proceeding.
