The resistivity rho, densityd and proportional limit {sigma}/sub p/ for several amorphous alloysas functions of shrinkage psi have also been determined. The resultson the curve of p-epsilon-c and {Delta}R/R-epsilon-c indicate the existenceof elastic, anelastic, and the plastic regions. Stress p and {Delta}R/Rincrease linearly with strain epsilon-c in the first two regions. Density,resistivity and proportional limit vary with psi obviously, however,their changes are very small after psiandgt;30%. Mechanism of the plasticdeformation occurring in amorphous alloys is also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
