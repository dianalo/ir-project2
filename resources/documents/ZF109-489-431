REPORTSandM;ON AS/400 WERE JUSTIFIED: IT ISandM;Bob Labant, IBM director of Application Business Systems and responsible forAS/400 development, was in the UK last week.andP;  He arrived hot on the heels ofhis marketing director, Mark Ryan, who was here in mid-September to tout thebenefits of the new low-end machines, and to convince the sceptics thatAS/400 users are the happiest bunch imaginable (CI No 1,514).andP;  Perhaps hedidn't do a very good job since Labant found it necessary to reiterate mostof the facts and figures that prove the AS/400 is irrefutably successful.andO;The rate of installation outstrips that of System 36s; double digit revenuegrowth during 1989 and the first half of 1990; market share is increasing;the number of new installations is on the up; the high-end machines areranked second only to the 3090-600 in the US; and since it's IBMspeak,customer satisfaction is high.andP;  Between 40% of installations are migrationsfrom Systems 34, 36, and 38, 30% is from multiple installations, and 30% isnew business.andP;  Of that last figure, half were non-IBM houses, and the restdidn't have a computer system.andP;  In terms of worldwide revenue, 45% is derivedfrom Europe, and Japan is the fastest growing market, although that is partlyexplained by the negligible base.andP;  Labant is perhaps more willing than hissubordinate to acknowledge that the history of the AS/400 has been achequered one, and IBM has not always displayed whole-hearted commitment.andO;For example, he says that Systems Application Architecture compliance wasneglected and that more should have been done more by now.andP;  To remedy that,he has reorganised the Rochester, Minnesota development site and appointedDave Schliker - the OS/400 architect - as head, alongside Burl Wheeler, MrSAA.andP;  Labant believes that IBM needs to get more SAA-compliance into theAS/400, and that it is now committed to doing so.andP;  However, he is moreambiguous on AD/Cycle.andP;  While the Synon alliance is a key application driver,Labant says that IBM is working on how much of AD/Cycle should be in theAS/400, and the issue is whether or not users really want anapplication-driven machine.andP;  IBM's neglect of System 36 users has been a sorepoint which the company tends to deny, saying that it cannot understand suchaccusations.andP;  Nonetheless, when asked if he would be exerting himself topersuade these users to ugrade, Labant's response was an unequivocal darnright, and he also admitted that - yet again - IBM should have done morebefore now.andP;  System 36 emulation ought to have been better, and the AS/400should be as easy to operate as System 36s.andP;  He reckons that both of thoseproblems have been addressed, and that more users will migrate as theirbusinesses will demand and benefit from AS/400 applications.andP;  Also importantis the openness of machine level instructions which provide the capability tocustomise applications.andP;  Changes in the mid-range arena, and user demands foran enterprise-wide system means that IBM will have to keep expanding theAS/400 in terms of power, communications and openness.andP;  Labant says that theAS/400 will cover a range of requirements, and there is no technological wallat the high-end.andP;  It is a lorry to an 18-wheeler system.andP;  Next year's Juneannouncement will double performance, and plans are afoot to go well beyondthat in the following 18 months.andP;  All of which sounds as though the AS/400could be in serious competition with some of the ES/9000 mainframes.andP;  Labantacknowledges that there will be an overlap - there already is with the 4381s- and he says that the AS/400 won't be in that marketplace to cause conflict,but because users are demanding more power without the expense of maintainingdata processing departments.andP;  Around 40% of AS/400 sales are to businesseswith between 50 and 1,000 employees, 25% go into small businesses, andcorporations with over 1,000 staff account for the remaining 35%.andP;  Since itis this last category that may well have a 3090 machine or equivalent, itseems that the AS/400 already has a foothold in the large systemsmarketplace.andP;  Interoperability, never an IBM favourite, has acquired such ahead of steam that TCP/IP, Ethernet and a more open Machine Level InstructionSet have had to become part of the AS/400 world.andP;  But Lavant believes thatwhile some vendors talk of openness only in Unix terms, his users want more.andO;Small businesses look for interoperability with PC-DOS, intermediateorganisations want personal computer support plus multi-vendorinteroperability, and the largest clients want personal computer support,multi-vendor support and System 370 interoperability.andP;  He denies that the Ccompiler for the AS/400 is a first step to doing a version of AIX Unix forthe machine, and maintains that applications will continue to differentiatebetween proprietary and open systems.andM;RS/6000 confusionandM;The RS/6000 and AS/400 are creating some confusion, but he says that theRS/6000 has not impacted on AS/400 sales, simply because there are manythings that the Unix machine can't do.andP;  It is not a question of Unixcapability, it just that users have to buy a database, systems management andnetwork management facilities.andP;  Labant says that these are already part ofOS/400 and require neither the installation of multiple systems andfootprints, nor a dedicated management team.andP;
