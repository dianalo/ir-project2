Merchants in Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf reportbusiness remains down since the Oct. 17 quake. They blamelingering fears that have scared off leisure travelers, andstill-damaged freeways that are causing regional visitors togo elsewhere for entertainment and shopping.</LP><TEXT>   Spring, the season of the Chinese New Year, is typicallythe busiest time of year in Chinatown. But businesses therehave seen sales drop 15% to 40%, says Rose Pak, consultant tothe city's Chinese Chamber of Commerce. Restaurants, giftshops, and even small Chinese bakeries and produce marketshave been affected, she says.   &quot;Besides the overall decline in tourists, there's been adecided drop in bedroom-community business,&quot; says Ms. Pak.&quot;It's too cumbersome now. We're worried the change in patternwill become a habit, and they'll never come in anymore.&quot;   &quot;It's truly a mess to come into the city and drivearound,&quot; says Al Falchi, owner of the Waterfront restaurant,which has seen business fall about 10%. &quot;There are so manydetours, you don't know where you're going.&quot;   Businesses have been hurt by the closure since the quakeof the major freeway artery leading to Chinatown, Fisherman'sWharf and North Beach, a popular neighborhood dominated byItalian restaurants.   To repair and strengthen the existing double-deckerfreeway structure would cost about $32 million and take abouteight months. But Mayor Art Agnos has suggested a plan toraze the structure and replace it with an undergroundfreeway, which would cost between $100 million and $120million, and take about five years to complete.   The current structure, built in the late 1950s, &quot;would beconsidered a monstrosity on the Thames or the Seine,&quot; saysArt Silverman, the mayor's deputy press secretary. &quot;The mayorfeels the earthquake has given us the opportunity to get ridof an eyesore.&quot; Tearing it down would ease safety concerns,he says, and the city believes federal funds would pay formost of the proposed new project.   San Francisco's board of supervisors is scheduled to voteon the mayor's proposal today. But Ms. Pak says at least 700Chinatown merchants will be shutting down their businesses toattend the meeting and oppose the proposal.   Most city hotels suffered only minor earthquake damage,and are in full operation, though occupancy rates are down.(The Hyatt Regency at the San Francisco Airport, however, hasbeen closed since the quake for repairs and reinforcement. Itis scheduled to reopen July 1.)   Occupancy fell sharply after the quake; Fisherman's Wharfhotels, which before the quake boasted the city's highestoccupancy rates, were down 7% for the year, says Jay Scott,hotel analyst with Laventhol andamp; Horwath. Citywide, theoccupancy rate for 1989 was 70%, compared with 72% the yearbefore. For the first quarter of this year, the rate was 68%.   Convention and business travel has rebounded, althoughfewer spouses are coming along for the trip. Independenttourists, who account for about a third of hotel rooms, &quot;havebeen very reluctant to come back,&quot; Mr. Scott says. Besidesquake fears, he says overall belt-tightening in travel, andhigher airfares, may have contributed to the drop in leisuretravelers. The prime tourist season, now approaching, &quot;willtell how much the memory of the quake has faded and how gooda marketing job the city has done.&quot;   Even though some merchants have tripled marketing budgets,&quot;there's no question some may close their doors,&quot; saysAlessandro Baccari, executive secretary of the Fisherman'sWharf Association, which represents major retailers and 144restaurants. Despite trying gimmicks ranging from a fishfestival to a live satellite telecast from the Wharf toAustralia, merchants have seen business fall 25% to 30%.   Even a half-year later, San Francisco still finds it toughto counter the television images of the fire and devastatedhomes in the Marina district, and of the Bay Bridge. &quot;Themedia showed the same pictures, over and over,&quot; Mr. Baccaricomplains. &quot;People say `My God, you've sunk into the bay, thewhole city's destroyed . . . We keep saying, `We're allright. We want you. We need you.' &quot;   Mother Nature shouldn't take all the blame for tourismwoes, says Sharon Rooney, spokeswoman for the San FranciscoConvention and Visitors Bureau. &quot;People are laying things atfoot of earthquake that don't belong there.&quot; Part of thereason for lower occupany rates may be that about 2,000 newhotel rooms have been added in the city in less than a year.The San Francisco Marriott, the city's second-largest hotelwith 1,500 rooms, opened the day of the earthquake.   Yet, she concedes misconceptions continue to hurt tourism.She recently received a clip from a Texas newspaper reportingthat the Golden Gate bridge was back up. (The Bay Bridge,which links San Francisco to Oakland, was damaged by thequake. The Golden Gate bridge was intact.) &quot;People see ourskyline and think, `Those buildings are going to fall on me.'We know that the buildings swing. Other people have to beeducated.&quot;   And despite the perception, based on erroneous earlyreports, that hundreds died in the quake, she notes 62 peoplewere actually killed, 13 of them in San Francisco. And sheadds, &quot;not a single tourist was injured. We're trying tostress that.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
