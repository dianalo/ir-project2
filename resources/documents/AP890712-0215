(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Mine Workers extended itscontract-sanctioned work stoppage Wednesday in a move that will keepabout 60,000 coal miners east of the Mississippi off the job therest of the week.   Police made 17 strike-related arrests in Virginia and nine in aPittsburgh suburb, and a federal judge refused to order railwayworkers to cross UMW picket lines in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.   The extension was intended to give The Pittston Co. time torespond to Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles' request to resumenegotiations with striking miners, said Howard Green, a UMWinternational executive board member.   ``Our goal is to get people back to work and get it settled,''Green said.   Pittston Chairman Paul Douglas was on jury duty this week and hassaid he wouldn't consider a meeting with UMW officials until thatobligation is over.   About 1,900 miners struck Pittston in Virginia, West Virginia andKentucky April 5 after working without a contract for 14 months.Wildcat sympathy strikes by as many as 37,000 miners in the Midwestand Appalachia began June 12.   On Monday, the union announced a three-day ``memorial period,''or cooling-off period, to take about 60,000 miners east of theMississippi River off the job. The extension of that work stoppageruns through Friday.   The UMW's 1988 contract with the Bituminous Coal OperatorsAssociation allows a memorial period up to 10 days.   Telephone calls to Pittston spokeswoman Susan Copeland were notimmediately returned, and Morris Feibusch, BCOA's vice president forpublic affairs, refused to comment on the extension.   Robert Quenon, chief executive officer of the giant PeabodyHolding Co., said he hopes to see hopes to see miners back on thejob at his company's mines soon.   ``It's taken them an awful long time to get things turnedaround,'' he said. ``I hope this two-day extension is about as longas it takes, and that's about all we have to say on the subject.''   But some of the 400 UMW members from Appalachia and the Midwestcamping out in Carterton in southwestern Virginia said they had noplans to end their wildcat strikes next week.   ``We're going to continue to show our support until some kind ofsettlement is reached,'' said Bill Wall of West Frankfort, Ill., whowalked away from his job at Brushy Creek Coal Mine.   UMW District 17 President Bob Phalen said the memorial period hadeased tension in the coal fields, though state police were reportingincreasing violence.   ``There's a lot of things in the coal field that have calmed downin three days, and an additional two days will help calm things evenmore,'' Phalen said.   In Virginia, state troopers made 17 strike-related arrests oncoal-hauling roads, mostly for impeding traffic, said state policeSgt. Mike Frank.   In Alabama, police said up to six shots were fired Wednesday at acoal-loading facility where union miners were harassing non-unionhaulers. A shot struck a coal truck, but no injuries were reported,officers said.   In the Pittsburgh suburb of Neville Island, Pa., police chargednine demonstrators with obstructing traffic and disorderly conductfollowing a protest in which UMW members blocked entrances to a cokeand iron plant for three hours.   UMW members said they targeted Shenango Inc. because it is ownedby a family whose Aloe Coal Co. near Imperial, Pa., operatesnon-union coal mines.   In Pittsburgh, U.S. District Judge Donald Ziegler refused toorder 230 Monongahela Railway Co. employees to cross UMW picketlines in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.   Some members of the United Transportation Union and theTransportation Communications Union have refused to work when minerspicket their job sites and to operate trains at night.   ``Monongahela Railway failed to prove its employees are not inany immediate danger,'' Ziegler said.</TEXT></DOC>
