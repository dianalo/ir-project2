At the end of trading, the dollar was quoted at 122.00 yen, up0.85 yen from Friday's close of 121.15 yen. Expectations that theU.S. Federal Reserve may raise key lending rates fueled dollarpurchases, dealers said.   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225selected issues plunged 380.27 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at28,983.32.   Analysts said a combination of the firmer dollar and investors'concern over a possible rate increase and higher oil pricestriggered a round of profit-taking.   It was the largest decline posted by the index since Aug. 29.   The dollar was bought in expectation that U.S. monetaryauthorities may raise prime lending rates and the nation's discountrate, the rate the Federal Reserve Board charges on loans tocommercial banks, a dealer at the Bank of Tokyo said.   Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita told reporters Monday thatJapan's central bank was closely watching for a possible move by theFederal Reserve, Kyodo News Service said.   The dollar opened higher at 121.60 yen and moved between 121.58yen and 122.00 yen throughout the day.   The firmer dollar and expectations of a tightening by the FederalReserve encouraged investors to take profits from the recent rallyon the Tokyo stock market, pushing prices lower, analysts said.   Investors were ready for a round of profit-taking after aneight-session rally that ended early last week, traders said. Duringthe rally the Nikkei rose 1,263 points, or 4.5 percent. UntilMonday, it had given up only about 67 points of that gain.   ``The view is spreading that there is a strong likelihood theU.S. will raise its discount rate,'' said a division chief atTaiheiyo Securities Co., who asked not to be named.   The dollar's rebound was also hard on prices, he said. The markethas risen along with the stronger yen, which is believed to dampeninflation by lowering import prices, taking pressure off the Bank ofJapan to tighten its monetary policy.   Trading was heaviest in large-volume steels and heavy industrials.   Investors sold steels, constructions and oil issues, anticipatingthat prices will rise when an agreement on production limits isreached in Vienna among the members of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries.</TEXT></DOC>
