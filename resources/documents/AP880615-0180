(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A security guard rescued a giant toad froma downtown street and splinted its broken leg with a paint stirrer,but one wildlife expert suggested the pesky four-pound amphibianwould be better dead than fed.   Jim Bartlett, 20, found the 9-inch green-and-brown toad when hegot out of his car after seeing an animal that had evidently beenstruck by a vehicle.   ``I thought it was a dead cat or something. I wasn't preparedfor this,'' Bartlett said Wednesday, holding up the toad he namedTurbo.   Wildlife and agriculture officials believe Turbo is a Bufomarinus, a giant toxic toad native to coastal areas in SouthAmerica but introduced to South Florida in the 1930s to try tocontrol the beetle population in sugar cane fields. They grow up toa foot long and are sometimes found around Miami.   ``I have never heard of one that far north,'' said HenryMushinsky, a biologist at the University of South Florida in Tampa.``But they are becoming more and more common here (in Florida). Thefact that we haven't had any harsh winters in the last few yearshas helped them move up both coastlines.''   Wildlife and agriculture officials fear the giant toad couldbecome a proliferating pest on the order of the Mediterranean fruitfly, the Formosan termite or the South American fire ant.   ``If he found several dozen, then we would be concerned,'' saidLt. John Moran, a wildlife inspector at the state Game andFreshwater Fish Commission office in Orlando.   One agricultural specialist whom Bartlett's mother, Mary,contacted suggested that their Turbo would be better dead than fed.   ``I can't see killing something that hasn't done anyone anyharm,'' said Bartlett, who has tried to nurse Turbo to health.   Bartlett said he would turn over the toad to the Central FloridaZoo. Senior reptile keeper Carl Barden will examine it.   Bufo marinus has glands near its eyes containing a strong poisonthat can cause temporary blindness in humans if the fluid comesinto contact with the eyes. The white secretion also can kill smallanimals, including cats and dogs, that eat the toad.   Turbo is showing signs of a pet personality, the Bartletts said.   ``He seems to like affection,'' said Mrs. Bartlett. ``When youstroke his back, he pushes himself up and moves around like a cat.''</TEXT></DOC>
