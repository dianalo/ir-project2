But don't call them senior citizens.   ``It's instant death,'' said Marion Williams, who developedBoston Five Cents Savings Bank's program for older customers.   ``In the early going, some banks made the mistake of pitchingaccounts with names like Golden Years,'' said Marsha Blasco ofFlorida National Bank Inc.   Since the early 1980s, banks around the nation have been payingmore attention to their older customers. Government figures projecta 40 percent increase in the number of people over 50 during thenext 10 years as the baby boom generation ages. This group earns$900 billion dollars a year and controls 75 percent to 80 percentof financial assets in the marketplace.   ``Those are numbers that say this is an important segment,''said Thomas Munsell of Shawmut National Corp. in Hartford, Conn.``They're there and have big dollars. But they're sophisticated andelusive.''   Munsell, who did considerable research in developing the Shawmut55 program, said the mature bank customer is anything but an easysell. They are very well-read and, in some cases, have the time tolook into and carefully compare what banks offer. ``These peopleare astute,'' he said.   Retirement account managers agree the most important point inwooing the over-55 set is they regard themselves as anything but``older.''   ``Most of these people consider themselves about 10 yearsyounger than they are,'' said Blasco, an assistant vice president.``They don't feel their age and are much more active than priorgenerations.''   When Barnett Banks of Jacksonville, Fla., in 1982 designed apackage of financial and banking services for older customers itwas an anomaly, said Denise Martin, retirement market manager. Now,the competition is fierce. ``Everybody is finally realizing thatit's a very important population.''   And the scramble has just begun, said Michael P. Sullivan, aCharlotte, N.C., consultant and author of ``Banking on the MatureCustomer.'' ``There's going to be some real warfare out there asmore and more attractive programs are made available to theseniors. Up till now, most banks have targeted the young urbanprofessional market. But suddenly they're realizing that 60 to 85percent of their savings balance is held by people over the age of50.''   To appeal to that market, hundreds of banks have adoptedprograms like Barnett's Senior Partners program. Specializedservices have become standard.   Customers over 55 can expect free checking, travelers andcashiers cheques. Special financial planning guides and accidentaldeath insurance have become de rigeur. And any bank worth its saltis liable to have a newsletter addressed to ``the mature bankingcustomer,'' Martin said.   In addition to standard banking discounts, marketing directorssaid their older customers are interested in travel, entertainmentand medical benefits.   ``They're no longer acquiring and are instead in theappreciation stage of life,'' said Williams, an assistant marketingmanager at Boston ive.   A Florida bank offers older customers free memberships to DisneyWorld's Magic Years Club and a pocketsized computer card containingthe client's entire medical history.   But travel perks and dining discounts aren't high on someseniors' lists, and many seniors banking programs require minimumbalances of as much $10,000, excluding many people on fixedincomes, said Barbara Hughes, a consumer affairs specialist at theAmerican Association of Retired Persons.   ``Our concern is for those who through deregulation andincreased fees have found banking services beyond their budget,''Hughes said. ``In many places banking services are beyond the reachof low- or moderate-income people.''   Between 70 percent and 80 percent of banks offer free checkingwith no minimum balance to people over age 60, said Ken McEldowneyof Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based advocacy group. But banksgenerally don't advertise them or notify customers they areeligible, and ``the advertising ends up targeting at thewell-heeled consumers in an attempt to persuade them to open anaccount with lots of frills and whistles when in fact such anaccount may not be as advantageous as a more stripped-downaccount,'' he said.   AARP has lobbied for increased sensitivity to older consumers'needs in all sectors, and in particular banks, Hughes said.``Seeing, hearing and moving may be diffficult for older consumers.And older consumers still very much like one-on-one-contact withindividuals at the bank tellers.''   Straight talk about banking service options is another thingolder customers want, she said. Banks have ``devised so manyinvestment vehicles that it's hard to comparison shop and to knowwhat you're getting into.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for XX</NOTE></DOC>
