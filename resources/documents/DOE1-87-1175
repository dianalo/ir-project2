To reflect the different crude dietsand product slates prevalent across Canada, refineries were segregatedinto four regions. A process simulator was used to compute the processparameters and models were developed representing the four regional compositerefineries. It was deduced hypothetically that no capital investmentwould be required if 2 g and 1 g per imperial gallon lead level controlswere imposed. To conform to a zero lead level control, the model indicatesthat significantly more processing capacity would be required in allregions. The approach adopted in the study was one whereby existing processunit capacity would be utilized to the best extent possible and as such,extra process units would be confined to catalytic reforming, virginnaphtha isomerization and alkylation. The associated incremental capitaland operating costs have been estimated. Projected construction scheduleshave been developed and a staggered 4-5 year program is recommended.It is considered that there will be many opportunities for market specializationto alleviate some of the constraining parameters induced when lead-freegasoline is produced, notably by refineries specializing in premium gasolineand diesel fuel. Brief discussions are included in the report on futuregasoline production to 1995, heavy oil refining, and technological progressto produce high octane gasoline without the use of lead anti-knock additives.20 refs., 22 figs., 66 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
