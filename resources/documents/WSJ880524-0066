Vice President George Bush and Gov. Michael Dukakis are now campaigning for next month's California primary, but already their focus is on November -- when this state may be a critical battleground in the general election.    The Republicans have carried California in eight of the last nine presidential elections and they believe that by winning here again they can seriously complicate the Massachusetts governor's fall plans. &quot;George Bush could win the election without winning California,&quot; says Craig Fuller, the vice president's chief of staff, &quot;but I don't think Dukakis can.&quot;    The worry of Republicans, however, is that Mr. Dukakis has built a substantial lead over Mr. Bush -- 17 percentage points, according to the latest Los Angeles Times poll -- in Ronald Reagan's home state. Mr. Dukakis, seeking to defeat the Rev. Jesse Jackson in the last round of spring primaries but to win his support for the autumn election, says confidently, &quot;California is winnable for us.&quot;    The vice president's difficulties here have led to a new round of talk that Mr. Bush might have to turn for a running mate to the bland Gov. George Deukmejian to salvage his chances here. That notion alarms California Republicans who don't want to turn over the governor's office to a Democrat as the state approaches congressional reapportionment after the 1990 census, when California is expected to gain four additional House seats.    &quot;If Bush can't win in California without Deukmejian, how's he going to win elsewhere?&quot; asks GOP Rep. William Thomas of Bakersfield. &quot;And if you put him on to win California, what does that cost you elsewhere?&quot;    The key to Mr. Dukakis's prospects almost certainly will lie in the large mass of blue-collar Democrats, principally in Southern California, who since Mr. Reagan's first gubernatorial campaign in 1966 have emerged as the critical block of swing voters. GOP Rep. Robert Badham of conservative Orange County acknowledges that Mr. Bush's &quot;voice and manner are not that of Ronald Reagan&quot; and says, &quot;We'll have to sell George Bush.&quot;    For that reason, Mr. Dukakis is stressing many of the themes that Mr. Reagan and Mr. Deukmejian used so deftly here. He went into an inner-city school here to talk to black students about drugs, emphasized family issues in a speech outside a church in Sacramento and flew to San Francisco to walk a police beat with a complement of officers and to talk with shopkeepers worried about crime in the city's Chestnut Street area.    Mr. Dukakis calculates that by getting the upper hand or at least neutralizing these social issues, he'll be positioned to capitalize on the economic issues. &quot;Democrats are at our best when we're talking about producing good jobs,&quot; Mr. Dukakis says in an interview shortly before the rally in the stifling heat of Sacramento. &quot;If we can do that, we'll win their support.&quot;    The Dukakis forces are building a field organization in the state far more extensive than they need for next month's primary because they intend to mobilize it again in November. Moreover, they are confident that backers of the Rev. Jackson, who has scant hopes of an upset in the primary, will fall in line behind the Democratic ticket in the fall.    But Mr. Dukakis has had less success with the politically active gay voters here, many of whom resent his policy of making it more difficult for gays and lesbians than for traditional couples to be foster parents. They object, moreover, to his refusal to issue an executive order banning discrimination on the basis of sexual preference.    &quot;His strategy is to be a liberal on most social issues but to stand up to gays so he looks more moderate,&quot; complains Eric Rofes, who heads the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center but who hasn't endorsed any candidate.&quot;    Mr. Bush's campaign has its own troubles here.    &quot;Bush is very much on the defensive here and the defenses aren't very good,&quot; says Austin Ranney, a political scientist at the University of California at Berkeley. &quot;He's surprisingly poorly prepared. He has no message for California. It doesn't seem as if he or his people have given any thought at all about how this state is different.&quot;    Only a last-minute intercession by Richard Douglas, senior vice president of Sun-Diamond Growers of California, prevented Mr. Bush from talking about the Export Enhancement Program, which is used to buy down the price of wheat, corn and soybeans in places like Iowa, instead of the Targeted Export Assistance Program, which affects California products like walnuts, in an agriculture speech in the Central Valley. The narrowly averted gaffe left some Republican political figures despairing.    Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater traveled to Capitol Hill recently to speak with GOP Sen. Pete Wilson of San Diego and his advisers about California, and the Wilson staff expressed astonishment at the campaign's failure to assess the state's mood. &quot;They don't have a clue,&quot; says one aide to Mr. Wilson, who is seeking a second Senate term.    The Wilson campaign has told Bush operatives that conservative Attorney General Edwin Meese is even more unpopular in California than Rose Bird, the liberal state supreme court chief justice ousted by voters two years ago. It also advised them that the vice president must distance himself from Mr. Reagan, whose record on the important issues of crime and drugs offers voters here little comfort.    And so Mr. Bush, too, is plunging into the drug issue, even stepping gingerly through the debris at a crack house on Los Angeles's East Side that was so heavily fortified that police needed a motorized battering ram to penetrate its three separate steel barriers.    &quot;This issue touches all Californians -- it's the biggest economic prop around -- and he's got to deal with it,&quot; says Mervin Field, the non-partisan California pollster. &quot;The public has the feeling that drugs are out of control, and that's a big negative for Bush.&quot;    Unless Mr. Deukmejian is selected as Mr. Bush's running mate, the GOP ticket will be only the third in the last 11 elections not to include a Californian. But the presence of a Californian doesn't guarantee the Republicans success; the 1948 ticket with Gov. Earl Warren as New York Gov. Thomas Dewey's running mate was defeated by President Harry Truman.    With Mr. Bush withdrawing from the 1980 presidential race before the California primary and with Mr. Reagan atop the ticket in 1980 and 1984, Mr. Bush has had little reason to make political trips or alliances in this state. &quot;We're almost strangers out here,&quot; says Peter Teeley, the vice president's spokesman.    The election may come down to a contest in a state where both candidates seem out of place. Even wearing sunglasses on a stage with a student production of &quot;Grease,&quot; Mr. Dukakis isn't the picture of the laid-back Californian. Mr. Bush, meanwhile, projects the air of the landed gentry in a land without a gentry.    &quot;Dukakis has a slight advantage,&quot; says Mr. Ranney, the Berkeley political scientist. &quot;We've all known Bush to be uncharismatic for decades. Californians have only known Dukakis to be uncharismatic for a few months.&quot;    ---                     California Statistics Population (July 1987, in thousands) .......... 27,663 Percentage of U.S. total ...................... 11.4% Percentage of state's population who are Hispanics (July 1987) ................. 23.2% Percentage of state's population who are blacks (July 1987) .................... 7.5% Percentage of state's population who are Asian-Americans or other minorities (July 1987) .................. 9.0% Percentage of state's registered voters who are Democrats (Jan. 1988) .......... 50.7% Percentage of state's registered voters who are Republicans (Jan. 1988) ........ 38.4$ Unemployment rate (April 1988) ................ 5.0% Per capita income (1985) ...................... $11,885 Rank in U.S. (1985) ........................... 8th highest   Sources: U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Labor Dept., Calif.
