III.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>The artificial-intelligence industry is driven by new technologyand is suffering from many 'growing pains' as the pace oftechnological change increases.andP;  AICorp's purchase of 1st ClassExpert Systems created a firm with a strong base in both theself-contained microcomputer expert system tool and micro tomainframe connectivity tool markets.andP;  Some once-successful firmshave failed, and many others are consolidating throughacquisitions and mergers.andP;  Many 'AI oriented' companies now denythey are in the artificial intelligence business or jump on the'object oriented programming' bandwagon.andP;  Use of intelligenttechnology now consists chiefly of attempts to improve on existingtechnologies that are already installed.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Artificial IntelligenceBusiness PlanningObject-Oriented ProgrammingComputer IndustryTrends.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>All Things ConsideredandM;Every once in a while, you have to sit back and examine what you're doingwith your life, career, goals, and of course, what you're doing with AI.andO;Many of the great thinkers of our time have made a profession out of suchcontemplation: Aristotle, Socrates, Plato, Nietzsche, Kant, Jean-Paul Sartre,Pee Wee Herman -- the list goes on.andP;  This activity is usually performed insome hazy field or lake-front like you see on the covers of new-age recordalbums and is often accompanied by a cold drink.andP;  And while Pepsi may thedrinking choice of a new generation, I still prefer a cold gin and tonic withfresh lime.andM;So that's what this column is all about: thinking about what's going on inthis business we've all grown to love.andP;  By my estimate, the AI industry is 15years old.andP;  That's when the first businesses such as Nestor and AICorp wereformed.andP;  But the actual business of AI started in 1984 when companies beganselling their products, so you could say the industry is only six years old.andO;On the other hand, commercial buyers of AI technology have been lining upsince only 1988, so maybe it's only two years old.andP;  Depending on how you lookat it, we're dealing either with a quickly growing adolescent or a toddler,and I tend to think of it as the latter.andP;  Despite the speed of changes thataccompany the ravages of being a teenager, more changes occur in the courseof a two year old's existence.andP;  The changes we've seen in the AI business inthe last few months, and the ones we're likely to see in the next few, aremore akin to a small child's rapid development.andM;Let's look at some of these changes, shall we?andP;  When AICorp bought 1st-CLASSExpert Systems last month, it created a new company firmly entrenched in twoseparate markets: fully contained PC-based expert-system tools and IBMenvironment tools for complete PC-to-mainframe integration.andP;  At the sametime, Borland International, that perennial favorite of the bargain-huntinghacker, decided to get out of the AI business by returning the marketingrights for Turbo PROLOG to the original developers -- essentially a totalwithdrawal from AI competition.andM;Last month, Gold Hill Computers shut its doors.andP;  At one time Gold Hill was atthe pinnacle of AI success; it had exploited the growing PC market for AIdevelopment tools and capitalized on the failure of Symbolics to maintain&quot;industry leadership.&quot;andP;  Gold Hill threw great parties, had fun, dedicatedemployees, and epitomized AI success.andP;  The memory of those days is simplythat -- a memory.andM;IntelliCorp, a top-five AI company since its inception, just acquired a smallstartup called MegaKnowledge, which developed a well-received object-basedproduct called KAPPA.andP;  Now IntelliCorp is taking a renewed strategy to themarket that will capitalize on its involvement with objects over the pastdecade.andM;Nestor, that vaunted if not rather haunted neural-net company, has reportedhorrendous losses over the past year.andP;  At the same time, Intel and Motorolaare demonstrating neural-net-based microprocessors that will allow developersto incorporate neural nets into standard architectures.andP;  Japanese giantsMitsubishi, NCC, NTT, and Matsushita are also introducing chips of this kind.andM;IBM is touting a complete application development solution in its newAD/Cycle strategy, introduced at the beginning of the year.andP;  AD/Cycle willallow the expansion of applications as a part of systems evolution, promisingthat users will not outgrow applications with inherent growth capabilities.andO;One of the five significant components of AD/Cycle is knowledge-baseintegration, and an expert system called TIRS, The Integrated ReasoningShell.andP;  This means that IBM (in theory, at least) sees aI as an essentialelement of future applications development.andP;  Many experts think this strategyindicates that IBM may finally be getting serious about expert systems,meaning that it will actually try to sell AI, as opposed to just talk aboutit.andM;Industry mainstays NeuralWare, Inference, Neuron Data, and Lucid are allreporting profits, a big deal when you consider that none of them have toreport anything; they're privately held companies.andP;  IntelliCorp has had itsbest year ever, and it seems that profitability is busting out all over.andM;Cimflex-Teknowledge, the company formed last year by Teknowledge and AmericanCimflex, is publicly held.andP;  It has changed both its NASDAQ trading symbol andits stripes; the company no longer actively competes in the AI market.andP;  Now,depending on who you talk to within CT, the company is still active in AIsomewhere, but I don't know where.andP;  And nobody at the Pittsburgh, Pa.,andO;headquarters seems to be able to find it, either.andP;  Its emphasis seems to beheaded in a more CAD/CAM/CASE/CAE direction, so I think it can be safely saidthat Cimflex is no longer a player in the AI market.andM;Well, that's a good smattering of what's going on in this industry.andP;  Sowhat's the pattern?andP;  Consolidation.andP;  Mergers, acquisitions, corporateshutdowns: all are tell-tale signs of a complete industry consolidation.andO;This change is not the same thing that happened in 1986-1987, when theindustry weakened by living on over-inflated expectations and hype.andP;  Whatwe're seeing is an honest-to-God consolidation.andP;  You know what I'm getting at-- the weeding out of the weak in favor of the strong.andM;Occurring simultaneously, and not necessarily fortuitously, is a renunciationof the past by many people and organizations in the business.andP;  In an informalsurvey conducted by The Relayer Group, almost 25% of companies classified asAI-oriented denied they were in the business.andP;  (AI is defined as involvingsome aspect of expert systems, natural language, neural networks, voicerecognition, machine translation, intelligent text or media, and relatedendeavors.)andP;  This denial is natural -- AI is the acronym that was hyped to ahysterical level that would make even Donald Trump proud.andP;  A lot of companiesare scared of the name.andP;  Symbolics doesn't even use the term in its marketingliterature.andM;But the fear of inappropriate appellations has even made some in the businesswant to do away with other generic terms, such as &quot;expert systems.&quot;andP;  There isa great whining across the land -- a whining of the sort that only dogs canhear -- about calling expert systems what they really are: knowledge-basedinformation systems.andM;Please, spare me.andP;  Just about the time the average computer user gets used tothe concept of expert systems and finds they are viable computer-softwaretools, a whole contingent of AI people start moaning about changing the nameof the game again.andP;  Or they jump on that other popular hayride,object-oriented programming.andM;Being object-oriented is all well and good, but let's not confuse the issuesor the marketplace.andP;  Object-oriented programming and expert-systemdevelopment are not the same thing.andP;  They can certainly be integral parts ofeach other (depending on which direction you're viewing them from), but theyare not the same thing.andP;  Just be prepared to get a new object-oriented namefor the product you bought as an expert-system development tool.andM;Finally, what is the purpose of all of this technology in the long run?andP;  Thisissue is the real one behind any changes in the AI business.andP;  I mean, what'sthe point?andM;By and large, companies aren't using AI just for fun, although I know a fewwho are.andP;  Mostly, however, using any intelligent technology is an attempt toimprove on existing installed technologies by creating applications or systemenhancements that perform what the observant user would call &quot;smart&quot;functions.andP;  This attempt has to do with the kinds of things people &quot;know&quot; asopposed to what they &quot;do.&quot;andP;  (Follow closely here, it gets tricky.)andP;  Forinstance, using a hammer to pound a nail is something you &quot;do.&quot;andP;  The factthat the hammer is used to immobilize the nail in a wall so you can hang apicture is something you &quot;know.&quot;andM;Traditionally, we've used computers as hammers -- tools for things that wedo.andP;  These activities include keeping rolodex files (databases), managing ourcorrespondence (word processors), acting as our calculator (spreadsheets),and a host of other &quot;doable&quot; things.andM;But the things we know are rarely used in these contexts.andP;  The word processordoesn't help us express what we know any better; it just facilitates puttingit on paper.andP;  A database doesn't really help us with the information we knowabout a person in our rolodex; it simply helps us keep it organized.andM;Intelligent technologies like expert systems take an entirely oppositeapproach; they do indeed facilitate what we know.andP;  Knowledge is captured (orautomated, cloned, codified, or whatever) in a medium that can behave in amanner closer to &quot;knowing&quot; than &quot;doing.&quot;andP;  The system that &quot;knows&quot; the soundof your voice or that an engine needs repair does not &quot;do&quot; the necessarywork.andP;  In an interesting paradox, people usually reverse roles with AI; they&quot;do&quot; what the machine &quot;knows.&quot;andP;  Or their doable work is simplified oroptimized because of what the machine &quot;knows.&quot;andP;  This fact is especially truein areas such as forms processing or policy underwriting, where the machine'sknowledge can spare individuals from mundane pursuits.andM;I hope that wasn't too philosophical.andP;  The business of AI has to be put intoperspective; changing the names doesn't disguise the purpose of thetechnology any more than calling a rose a pile of dung changes its nature.andO;However, corporate consolidation does validate the purpose and nature of thetechnology, which can be put to its proper use by companies in strongpositions to continue development of intelligent systems.andM;Join me next month when we discuss new applications being developed by peoplewho have an appreciation for the finer things in life, like a good expertsystem, the pursuit of true machine intelligence, and a perfect gin andtonic.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
