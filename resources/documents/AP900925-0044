As part of its ninth annual Banned Books Week, the AmericanLibrary Association has released a list of censored books and theirauthors, ranging from Dr. Seuss to Stephen King.   ``We need to bring to the attention of the American public thefact that our First Amendment rights are under attack,'' saidJudith Krug, director of the association's Office for IntellectualFreedom.   More than 1,000 attempts to challenge or ban books were reportedto the 51,000-member American Library Association in the year up toMay, Krug said.   Webster's Dictionary was challenged in the Upper PittsgroveTownship, N.J., school district by parents who objected to itsdefinition of sexual intercourse as ``the sexual joining of twoindividuals,'' said Paul Whitman, secretary of the school board.   Webster's 1986 edition was removed from fourth- and fifth-gradeclassrooms last fall but is still used in upper levels, Whitmansaid.   A year ago, ``The Lorax'' by Dr. Seuss was challenged in aLaytonville, Calif., school district. Parents working for a locallogging company said the children's book offered a negativeportrayal of the industry.   The book remained on the second grade's required reading listuntil teachers decided to put it on an optional list in the spring,said Superintendent Brian Buckley.   Stephen King's ``The Stand'' was restricted to ninth-gradestudents with parental consent at a Beaverton, Ore., school afterparents raised objections to violence and sexual language.   Another King novel, ``Christine,'' was removed from libraryshelves at a Connecticut district after a parent complained aboutoffensive passages.   Banned Books Week, which runs through Saturday, is ``acelebration of our freedom to read,'' Krug said.   ``We've proven time and time again that censorship dies in thelight of day,'' Krug said.   Krug said she advises librarians and teachers to set specificpolicies on censorship, but professionals aren't the only ones whocan get involved. Anyone who attends school board meetings orwrites letters to newspapers can have an effect.   ``As individual citizens we have to stand up and be counted,''Krug said.</TEXT></DOC>
