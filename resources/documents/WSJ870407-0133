The differing prospects reflect the recent surge in prime-related or other variable-rate consumer debt, even as a growing number of large corporations are obtaining bank credit at below-prime rates or finding even less costly alternatives. The trend has essentially expanded the clout of banks to automatically dip into consumer pocketbooks whenever short-term rates rise.    If the prime rate keeps rising, &quot;a lot of consumers could be very unpleasantly surprised,&quot; says Randall Sanada, a Chatsworth, Calif., financial planner. &quot;People need to be more concerned than ever about rising rates.&quot;    Prime rate-related consumer debt is difficult to measure precisely but appears to be growing rapidly. In the past 18 months, consumers have signed up for some $40 billion in home equity lines of credit, which are frequently linked to the prime. The Federal Reserve Board estimates that 10% of the $578 billion in outstanding consumer installment debt carries variable rates, which are often pegged to the prime. American Express Co.'s recently announced Optima card is one of a growing number of credit cards pegged to the prime.    If the prime rate does increase sharply because of soaring money costs at banks and savings and loans, consumers also will have to worry about their $335 billion of adjustable rate mortgage debt, which will also increase in cost although much more slowly. Equity home loans and variable-rate consumer installment debt are usually tied to the prime rate; adjustable rate mortgages are usually tied to indexes for the cost of deposits and other short-term borrowings by banks and Sandamp;Ls.    The increase in the prime rate last week, to 7.75% from 7.5%, won't by itself make much difference in most consumers' monthly bills, and most economists don't expect rates to start soaring soon. But the increase was the first in three years, and a series of even modest boosts over coming quarters could jolt consumers. Bankers' groups say home equity lines alone could swell to $200 billion in four or five years, putting consumers further at risk.    &quot;I don't think a quarter percentage point will make a big difference,&quot; says Allen Sinai, chief economist for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. &quot;But if we get three, four or five of these, American families will really feel it in their pockets.&quot;    Moreover, because banks control the prime rate, some groups fear the possibility of future gouging, particularly because consumers have fewer credit options than corporations. Banks insist that prime rate increases reflect changes in their borrowing costs, but some believe other factors, including possible Latin loan losses, influenced the latest move.    &quot;It gives banks a further opportunity to hit consumers with artificially high rates,&quot; says Robert Gnaizda, a partner with Public Advocates Inc., a San Francisco-based public interest law firm.    For business, usually allied with the prime, the strategic rate is &quot;less meaningful today than ever in the past,&quot; says James McDermott, research director for Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., a bank securities firm.    Increasingly, banks have priced corporate loans as a function of their own borrowing costs or of other indexes, such as the London rate at which they lend one another money. Greenwich Associates, a Greenwich, Conn., consulting firm, found last year that the nation's largest companies generally borrow at rates &quot;well below&quot; the prime. In recent years, several banks have stopped using the term altogether because it no longer denotes their best rates.    Cut rates aside, banks currently account for less than 60% of short-term lending to big companies, down from 85% two decades ago, federal statistics show. Meanwhile, consumer loans have taken on growing significance. At BankAmerica Corp., for example, consumer installment loans have jumped 32% since 1982, including a growing portion that is variable-rate, while commercial and industrial loans have increased only 11%.    Consumers' growing stake in the prime rate may mean that changes in the rate will be more politically scrutinized. &quot;It may focus consumer attention on what causes interest rates to go up,&quot; says Lamar Smith, chief economist of the American Bankers Association, who nonetheless believes prime-related consumer debt is still &quot;relatively insignificant.&quot;    It may also deepen concern about other rates. Only a third of consumers believe credit card rates are fair, estimates Bank Credit Card Observer, a Kendall Park, N.J., newsletter. John Pollock, the letter's publisher, believes pegging card rates to variable market rates will make consumers less skeptical. &quot;But the prime is an administered rate,&quot; he says. &quot;We'd prefer rates more related to the market.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
