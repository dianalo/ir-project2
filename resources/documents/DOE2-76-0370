<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-76-0370 </DOCNO><TEXT>The dissolution of a soda-lime glass has been investigated in three differentaqueous solutions (deionised water, 5 M NaCl, and Si rich solutions)and at two temperatures (100 and 200/sup 0/C), in order to discriminatebetween proposed models based on ion exchange and/or molecular waterdiffusion. H and Na depth profiles of leached samples have been obtainedwith specific resonant nuclear reactions. We show that the variationswith depth of both the ratio of incorporated H to released Na and thedifference between these quantities are key parameters, suggesting thesimultaneous involvement of H/sup +/ and H/sub 2/O in the dissolutionof this silicate glass, the dominant species depending on both temperatureand solution composition. We tentatively attribute the chemical characteristicsof the hydrated layer to the formation of a stoichiometric Ca hydrosilicate.</TEXT></DOC>
