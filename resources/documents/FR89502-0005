Twenty-one effective comment letterswere received. Twelve comment letters (from private citizens, citizensgroups, regional coalitions and environmental groups) opposed the applicationof LBB to ECCS or EQ while eight comment letters (from utilities, a nuclearsteam supply system vendor, industry groups and a nuclear fuel vendor)supported such an application. One nuclear steam supply system vendor tooka neutral position.Among those opposing, repeated citation was made to the Surry pipe rupturein December 1986, the March 1988 General Accounting Office report, ``ActionNeeded to Ensure that Utilities Monitor and Repair Pipe Damage,'' the purportedunreliability of ultrasonic testing to detect piping flaws and public statementsmade in August 1983 by the then Director of the Office of Nuclear ReactorRegulation (NRR) pertaining to intergranular stress corrosion crackingin BWR piping. The NRC has determined that none of these citations discrediteither the present or proposed expanded scope of LBB. This is explainedas follows: LBB acceptance criteria cannot be satisfied in the feedwatersuction line which ruptured at Surry. There is no reason to expect LBBbehavior in this line. The cited GAO report treated erosion/corrosion ofpiping. The factors which control erosion/corrosion are sufficiently understoodso that the NRC can determine with confidence which piping systems aresusceptible to erosion/corrosion. NRC acceptance criteria do not permitpiping subject to erosion/corrosion to qualify for LBB. Difficulties withultrasonic testing are irrelevant to LBB. Leakage detection with high marginsis used instead to detect throughwall cracks in high energy piping duringservice. The statements made in August 1983 to the Commissioners by thethen Director of NRR were made at a time when LBB had not advanced to itspresent state, and moreover were directed to BWR piping. Unless specialmaterials or measures are employed, LBB cannot be applied to BWR pipingbecause of intergranular stress corrosion cracking.The nuclear steam supply system vendor that took a neutral position withrespect to the application of LBB to EQ and ECCS recognized that limitedsafety and operational benefits could result. However, this vendor concludedthat for plants utilizing its design comparable benefits could be obtainedemploying another recent rule change (as described below), and that ``economicbenefit * * * does not appear to be major, and net safety benefits maynot outweigh the detriments.''Among those supporting the expanded use of LBB to EQ and ECCS, many economic,operating, testing, maintenance and design benefits were cited. The NRCremains firm in using safety benefits as the prime measure in decidingwhether to divert limited resources to the research and rulemaking effortsneeded to apply LBB to EQ and ECCS. A few safety benefits were identifiedin public comment. These are discussed as follows. The test and designrequirement for fast starting of emergency diesel generators is derivedfrom the double-ended guillotine rupture of reactor coolant loop pipingwhen analyzed in accordance with 10 CFR 50.46 and Appendix K. The testrequirement degrades bearings, gears, the governor and power transmissionsuch that the propsect of reliable service from the emergency diesel generatorscould be diminished if pipe ruptures actually occur. Using LBB to postulatesmaller pipe ruptures would lengthen the starting time and assist in preservingthe reliability of the emergency diesel generators for some (but not all)plants. A second safety benefit deals with radiation embrittlement of thereactor pressure vessel. The relatively low peaking limits for the fuelwhich results from the currently required analyses might be increased insome plants when smaller LOCAs replace the double-ended guillotine breakrequirement. With higher peaking limits the fuel configuration can be redesignedto yield less radial fluence leakage. This can mitigate concerns with vessellife extension and pressurized thermal shock of the vessel. An additionalsafety benefit can be achieved by equipment reliability improvements (otherthan for the emergency diesel generators) resulting from fewer plant scramsand challenges due to lower ECCS set points and less harsh equipment qualificationenvironments. However, reliability improvement due to lower ECCS set pointsand less harsh equipment qualification environments may be offset by safetydegradations associated with such actions, particularly with respect tosevere accident performance. It is presently uncertain that overall safetywould improve when less harsh EQ profiles are specified or ECCS set pointsare reduced.In large part, the first two safety benefits cited above can be obtainedat this time more expeditiously and efficiently under the recent ECCS rule(53 FR 35996, September 16, 1988) which permits best estimate methodologywith quantified uncertainty for evaluating LOCAs. The models needed forimplementing the ECCS rule have undergone substantial development; however,research must be initiated to develop replacement design basis pipe ruptureswhen LBB is invoked for ECCS. Moreover, whereas the ECCS rule already existsin final form, the rulemaking needed to expand LBB technology would consumeat least two years and considerable NRC effort. Finally, while the ECCSrule can be applied directly to all light water reactors (except one withstainless steel fuel cladding), LBB can be applied only to qualifying reactors.The scope of qualifying reactors is unclear; especially in question areBWRs.With respect to harsh environments inside the containment, unless LBB canbe successfully applied to main steam lines, harsh environments will notsubstantially change. Significant requirements will remain unless mostof the large diameter piping inside the containment satisfy LBB requirements.Additionally, other breaches in the fluid system boundary, such as failedmanways or valve bonnets, must be examined to determine whether they controlEQ profiles. Reductions in EQ profiles are more readily achieved outsidethe containment because temperature, pressure and humidity do not build-updue to venting and blow out panels in some cases. However, EQ profilesoutside the containment attract lesser interest because the EQ profilesare usually less harsh and thus more easily satisfied.A few commenters noted difficulties with cable insulation, seals and valveseats resulting from materials selected to resist harsh environments associatedwith the postulated double-ended guillotine pipe rupture. The NRC acknowledgesthese difficulties, but is not certain that reducing harsh environmentswould, on balance, increase safety. Additionally, it was suggested thatthe threat of pressurized thermal shock would be reduced by lower pumpingset points for low pressure safety injection. The NRC does not accept thisposition because pressurized thermal shock is controlled by injection ofcold water at relatively high pressure during a small break LOCA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Policy Statement</ITAG>Having considered all public comments received, the Commission has decidednot to undertake any rulemaking to extend the applicability of LBB to ECCSor EQ at this time. In large part, any safety benefits associated withECCS can presently be more readily obtained under the recent ECCS rule.The use of exemptions for applying LBB to environmental qualification waspermitted in the revision to General Design Criterion 4 (52 FR 41288).This option continues to remain open.Nonetheless, the Commission has decided to keep open an avenue for futureconsideration of rulemaking which would permit the application of LBB toECCS and EQ. The Commission encourages industry to develop quantitativeinformation that could justify the diversion of resources to the rulemakingefforts. Primary attention should be given to establishing an appropriatesubstitute or replacement for the double-ended pipe rupture used in ECCSand EQ evaluations. The Commission will consider modifying its currentECCS and EQ regulations when adequate technical justification supportsthe feasibility and benefits of the proposed modifications. In the interim,the Commission recognizes that situations may arise where justificationcan be developed by the industry for alternative ECCS and EQ requirements.Such justifications, if accepted by the Commission pursuant to the existingexemption process, would allow a limited number of case-by-case modificationsto ECCS and EQ requirements. This could support future amendments to applicablerequirements addressing ECCS and EQ.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 26th day of April 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Samuel J.
