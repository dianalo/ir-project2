(AP) - A 58-year-old former grocery storeclerk accused of using arsenic to poison two husbands and aboyfriend over 16 years goes on trial Monday and could get thedeath penalty if convicted.   Blanche Taylor Moore, once described by a police official as``an average, ordinary neighborhood lady,'' is charged withfirst-degree murder in the Oct. 7, 1986, poisoning death of RaymondReid, who was her boss and later became her boyfriend.   Although several women are on death row, only one woman has beenexecuted in this country since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court rulingallowing states to resume the death penalty. Velma Barfield, alsoof North Carolina, was put to death in 1984 at age 52 for poisoninga boyfriend.   Prosecutors say Mrs. Moore systematically poisoned Reid; JamesN. Taylor, her first husband, who died in 1973; and the Rev. DwightMoore, her second husband, who survived.   Non-fatal amounts of arsenic also were found in the bodies ofher father, who died in 1966, and mother-in-law from her firstmarriage, who died in 1970. No charges were filed in those cases.   Moore was hospitalized in May 1989 shortly after returning homefrom his honeymoon. Doctors were perplexed by his severe nausea andvomiting. Tests showed the Burlington minister had ingested a nearfatal dose of arsenic; he remains disabled from it.   Hospital officials notified police, who began checking into thepast of Moore's bride.   They discovered that Reid, 50, had died three years earlierafter a long hospital stay. His body was exhumed and an autopsyshowed he died from arsenic poisoning.   A subsequent autopsy also found a fatal level of arsenic in theexhumed body of Taylor, who died at age 45 in 1973. At the time,his death was attributed to a heart attack.   Mrs. Moore will be tried later on the second murder charge inTaylor's death and assault charges in the poisoning of Moore.   Since her arrest July 18, 1989, Mrs. Moore has been held withoutbail in the Alamance County Jail in Graham, just a few miles fromBurlington, where she had once lived and worked at the localKroger's grocery store.   Mrs. Moore has steadfastly maintained her innocence.   ``She's been stuck in a cell in the county jail, and it hastaken its toll,'' one of her attorneys, Mitchell McEntire, saidlast week. ``But she has a spirit about her that remains verystrong.   ``Her innocence has given her the strength to overcome it all.''   While prosecutors declined to discuss the case, McEntire said heexpects the trial to last from six to eight weeks, including juryselection. He said dozens of witnesses will be called by bothsides.   ``I think it will be difficult to pick a jury,'' he said, addingthat the judge denied a defense motion for a different location forthe trial because of extensive pretrial publicity.   After Mrs. Moore was charged in the three poisonings, policealso investigated the deaths of several of her relatives andfriends.   Medical examiners subsequently found abnormally high, but notfatal, levels of arsenic in the bodies of her father, Parker KiserSr., who died at age 62 in 1966 after suffering his eighth heartattack, and Isla Taylor, Mrs. Moore's mother-in-law, who died in1970 at 83.   No charges were filed in those deaths.   Last spring, there was a new spin in the case.   A five-page, handwritten letter was delivered May 25 to Mrs.Moore at the jail. The letter, dated May 19, was signed by GarvinThomas, 59, of Burlington, who had died of natural causes May 22.It letter said Thomas was obsessed with Mrs. Moore and that heconfessed to the poisonings.   Prosecutors have since claimed Mrs. Moore wrote the letterherself. But defense lawyers claim they have evidence to prove thatThomas wrote the letter shortly before he died.</TEXT></DOC>
