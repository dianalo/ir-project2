But tourist industryofficials aren't waiting to see.;    They're trying a new strategy aimed atmaximizing the dollars spent in the state by Californians and residents ofnearby states. The theory is that people don't give up travel during toughtimes, they just don't wander as far.;    &quot;When times are tough, people areinclined to stay close to home and hearth,&quot; said Michael Collins, vicepresident of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau.;    &quot;You don'tplan a vacation while watching CNN and worrying about your cousin in theMiddle East. On the other hand, you will need family Randamp;R, and preferably closeto home,&quot; said Margie Ranc, executive director of Santa Barbara Conference andVisitors Bureau.;    Santa Barbara hotels, with visits by affluent singles andcouples already depressed by bad publicity about drought and fire, areshifting marketing tactics. They are trying to attract California families whomight have vacationed farther away at a less tense time, Ranc said.;    Buteven if the number of visitors to Santa Barbara doesn't decline, the amountthey spend probably will. And that could have a dramatic impact on retailsales in the city, 30 percent of which depend on tourists, she said.;    AtDisneyland in Anaheim, the marketing already reflects the switch.;    Earlierthis month, the park cut its admission prices for Southern Californians to $20for an adult or child. The lower price, in effect at least through March 3,compares with a normal $27.50 adult ticket or $22.50 child's ticket.;   &quot;There is a sort of stay-at-home philosophy because of the uncertainties,&quot;said Walt Disney Co. spokesman Tom Deegan. &quot;And for a lot of people, theattraction of a one-day trip is high.&quot;;    Disney's latest quarterly earningswere lower than a year earlier, as operating income from the theme park andresort division fell 15 percent.;    Too much of a decline in tourism andtravel could be devastating for the state as it faces a budget deficitestimated at $7 billion to $9.9 billion this year.;    The industry, broadlydefined to include everything from airline tickets to hotel rates torestaurant tips, generated an estimated $48.5 billion in spending inCalifornia in 1989, said Fred Sater, a spokesman for the state Office ofTourism.;    State tax receipts from that spending were $1.9 billion, localtax receipts $840 million; 727,000 jobs with a payroll of $10.4 billion weregenerated, Sater said.;    Fears abroad can affect travel even within thestate, said Margie Matsil, an agent with the small Travel Travel agency inIrvine.;    Two business travelers who work for a Japanese-based companyrecently canceled flights to San Francisco on orders from the company, whichbanned all flying, she said.;    The state's airports were predictably slow,but there was some unexpected good news for airport restaurant operators, astravelers urged to arrive early for security reasons looked for ways to killtime.;    As security was clamped down at San Francisco International Airportlast week, domestic business was estimated to be 10 percent off, andinternational travel about 25 percent below usual levels.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Los Angeles  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910128  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  567  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday January 28, 199100028002,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
