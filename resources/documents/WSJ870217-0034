Mr. Shamir also defended Israel's role in those arms shipments in clear east-west strategic terms. &quot;In the framework of strategic cooperation in our area, we considered it important to have some contacts between the United States and this strategically important country, Iran,&quot; the 72-year-old Israeli leader said. &quot;We cannot leave this country only to Soviet influence. . . . This has to be one of the goals of the policy of the free world. We have not to give up.&quot;    His comments came in a wide-ranging interview on the first day of an official visit to the U.S. that Israeli officials hope will help strengthen bilateral strategic cooperation in the region. Sitting back in a large chair in his New York hotel room, he was unusually expressive and expansive ahead of meetings in Washington with Secretary of State George Shultz today and President Reagan tomorrow.    Mr. Shamir's clear intention was to put behind him Israel's involvement in the Iranian arms sales and the controversy over Israeli spying on the U.S., and move on to other issues. He said that Israel wouldn't allow its citizens to appear before investigative committees or commissions in the U.S., though it would establish channels to answer questions put to the Israeli government through the State Department.    He said his trip also would focus on lobbying Jewish organizations and the government to change the U.S. policy of treating Soviet Jewish emigres as refugees. The apparent intention of this effort is to ensure that more Jews will come to Israel if Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev loosens emigration policies. He'll vigorously oppose any efforts at calling an international peace conference for the Middle East, and he wants to more concretely define strategic cooperation under Israel's classification as a major ally of the U.S. outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.    The White House told Mr. Shamir last week that the U.S. Congress would be informed of this new classification, and now he wants to &quot;fill this title with contents.&quot;    Under pressure from the U.S. Congress and American Jews, Mr. Shamir obliquely suggested Israel is reassessing its arms-sales relationship with South Africa. The most pressing factor is the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, passed by Congress in October, that decreed that the State Department must outline other nations' arms sales to South Africa by the end of March, &quot;with a view toward ending military assitance to countries engaged in that trade.&quot;    &quot;We are sensitive to all these demands of the international community,&quot; Mr. Shamir said, but he added that Israel wouldn't abandon its commitments.    The Israeli leader placed particular emphasis on the Soviet emigration issue as he prepared for his first visit to Washington since he succeeded Shimon Peres last October as the head of the national unity government that joins Mr. Shamir's Likud and Mr. Peres's Labor coalitions.    He said the U.S. policy of classifying Soviet Jewish emigres as refugees &quot;is a weak point&quot; in the Israeli effort to gain freer emigration policies from Moscow. Of the 1,000 Soviet Jews given exit visas to emigrate to Israel last year, some 80% went elsewhere once they reached transit centers in Vienna and Rome. Most of those went to the U.S., using their refugee status.    &quot;The Soviets have a case,&quot; he said of Moscow's complaints about emigration procedures. &quot;They should not be considered homeless refugees. They have a homeland, a country that is ready to help them and absorb them. I will try to convince the Jewish leaders, and I will speak about it also in the government.&quot;    That said, Mr. Shamir stressed that he hadn't yet seen any important changes of Soviet policies that would make him expect an increased emigration flow. &quot;Soviet officials try to make the impression that something is going on, but behind this impression, nothing exists,&quot; he said. Two recent meetings between Soviet and Israeli ambassadors in Washington were more polite than such encounters in the past, he said, but brought no results.    Mr. Shamir particularly opposed letting Moscow into the Middle East peace process through the means of an international conference proposed by Jordanian King Hussein and supported by Mr. Peres, who is now Israel's Foreign Minister. Mr. Shamir also said the U.S. government doesn't favor such a meeting, despite rumors that the U.S. has increased its interest.    &quot;We don't see any reason to give the Soviets such a role in our area,&quot; Mr. Shamir said. He said he would discuss the idea of such a conference in Washington, &quot;but I don't think Secretary Shultz believes in the necessity of such a conference.&quot; Mr. Peres has said that he wants a nonbinding international forum that would get the peace process going but wouldn't be the framework for actual negotiations. King Hussein of Jordan has shown some willingness to join direct talks with Israel if an international conference is convened first.    Mr. Shamir wouldn't comment directly on new revelations that U.S. Navy intelligence analyst Jonathan Jay Pollard was perhaps a more important Israeli spy in the U.S. than at first reported. He is said, however, to be angered by the Justice Department's decision to lift the immunity of three key witnesses on the grounds that Israel hasn't met its promises to be fully cooperative in providing information for the prosecution.    &quot;We have cooperated with the United States to put an end to this painful experience,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a rogue operation against the policy and the will of the Israeli government. For us all, this story is closed.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
