Bill Clinton worries that the Democratic presidential race is getting so nasty that none of the candidates is going to survive Super Tuesday in very good shape.    &quot;When the smoke clears, we have to find a way to put our campaign together,&quot; says Mr. Clinton, who is officially neutral but who turned out here, fraternally, at a campaign appearance by Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee.    Super Tuesday, the single biggest primary-campaign day in American political history, is getting nastier by the hour. &quot;Right now,&quot; says Gov. Clinton, &quot;the Republicans are split more than we are.&quot; That means, he figures, that the &quot;stature gap&quot; that once existed between the Democrats and the Republicans has narrowed in the Democrats' favor. But a prolonged battle among Democrats will only help the Republicans.    Many observers expect the Republicans will end their slugfest after Super Tuesday and rally around a single candidate, Vice President George Bush.    Super Tuesday -- the big day when 20 states and American Samoa are at stake for the Democrats and 17 states are up for grabs for the Republicans -- isn't turning out to be anything like the contest its original sponsors envisioned. To those who subscribe to the idea that it was established to turn both parties to the right, it's downright foolish. It's felicitous only to those who simply want the South to have a day in the full glare of national publicity -- two hours of prime time television tonight on two networks, one hour of prime time on the third network.    &quot;So maybe we don't have a horse (a conservative front-runner),&quot; says Democratic State Rep. Charles Capps of Mississippi, chairman of the Southern Legislative Conference. &quot;But we've had more attention paid to us in the last two months than we had the last 100 years.&quot;    Southern politicians, including those in the Southern Legislative Conference, hoped that by holding 14 contests in or on the borders of the South on one glorious day they would change the dynamics of American politics. (It is simply fortuitous that contests are also being held the same day in two New England states and four Western states.)    Former Gov. Charles Robb of Virginia thinks Super Tuesday is helping the South have more of a voice in politics. At the least, he said at a lunch with reporters yesterday, the campaign rhetoric has changed, aimed more directly at a Southern audience. Caucus states have become primary states, encouraging more participation. And, given the size of the audience, candidates are taking &quot;the grand view of the presidency as opposed to retail politicking.&quot;    He adds that the one candidate with a message is Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, conceding that his own candidate, Sen. Gore, &quot;doesn't really have a message as such.&quot;    Deep down, many Southern Democrats hoped Super Tuesday would pave the way to the nomination of one of their own as an electable moderate in November's general election. The &quot;horse&quot; many of them had in mind was Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia. Another possibility was Mr. Robb.    The polls show the front-runners for the Democrats are Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, a traditional Democratic liberal, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a radical on many issues. In the latest Gallup Poll in Texas, for example, they run first and second. The two moderates in the race, Rep. Gephardt and Sen. Gore, run third and fourth, with some indication that Mr. Gore is finally beginning to make his move. There are 1,307 Democratic convention delegates at stake today, and the party's proportional-representation rules give candidates a chance to win delegates as long as they pick up 15% of the vote.    The Republicans didn't have much to do with organizing Super Tuesday, but they are going to see one of their conservatives, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, come to the end of the line and another, Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson, continue to fade away. The two front-runners, Vice President Bush and Sen. Robert Dole, are both pragmatic Republicans.    The Republican rules are different. It's winner-take-all at the congressional-district and statewide levels in eight states with a total of 428 delegates. That means Mr. Bush, who may be leading in all 17 states, could roll up huge delegate numbers that could put him well on the way to the nomination.    Still to be considered after the smoke has cleared is the sheer size of Super Tuesday, and the consequences of trying to run reasonably rational campaigns across a territory larger than Europe. Bone-weary candidates puddle-jumped from one airport -- and one media market -- to another, trying to say something memorable, if they could just remember where they were.    Gov. Clinton says he tries to turn out to greet all the Democratic candidates as they barnstorm through Arkansas. He figures there's a slight chance it might help put them in &quot;a good humor.&quot;    In the final hours of Super Tuesday campaigning, the TV commercials became meaner and more strident, and still the electorate that was supposed to rise to the bait of the nation's first big regional primary remained sluggish. </TEXT></DOC>
