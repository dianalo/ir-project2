In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-stock index, which dropped 251.50points Wednesday, gave up another 239.69 points to 24176.54.</LP><TEXT>   However, in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei rose 11.21 points toclose the morning session at 24187.75.   Thursday's first-section volume was estimated at 230million shares, up from 216.1 million shares on Wednesday.Decliners outnumbered gainers, 716-233.   The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of allfirst-section issues, which fell 7.91 points Wednesday,retreated 14.95 points to 1822.66.   With the half-point cut in the discount rate to 5% out ofthe way, investors were looking for positive factors. As therate reduction failed to bring investors back to the market,index-linked arbitrage selling and an unwinding of futurespositions pushed the Nikkei down Thursday. Foreign buyers,who supported the market from early summer, have begun topull back. This and stubborn short-term market rates signal afurther drop for the Nikkei.   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-shareindex rose 15.1 points to 2561.6. The FT 30-stock indexgained 6.9 points to 1963.3. Volume was 462.4 million shares,compared with 452 million shares a day earlier.   Though positive earnings reports propelled London'soptimism, its focus was selective, on blue chips withdividend-growth promise. Robust futures buying also lentsupport to stocks' rise, which was checked in late trading byWall Street's soggy opening performance and by the pound'ssoftening against the German mark.   Most Frankfurt stock prices ended little changed intrading dominated by professionals, despite a spate of newssuch as strong corporate earnings, deals and analysts'recommendations. The DAX 30-stock index eased 2.27 points to1620.96. Elsewhere in Europe, where big bourses mostly scoredgains, Madrid share prices dropped sharply in response togloomy economic news for Spain and expectations of poornine-month earnings results. Paris stocks had a strongtechnical rally, spurred by bullish U.S. inflation figures.   Big stock markets were mixed in Asia and the Pacific.Profit-taking led to Hong Kong shares' solid decline, thoughthe market remains generally bullish after its recentrecord-setting rally that set five records in six sessions.   Among corporate developments, in Tokyo, Honda Motor fell10 yen to 1,490 yen ($11.45). The auto maker's consolidatedpretax profit for the six months ended Sept. 30 rose 4.5% to90.64 billion yen ($696.7 million) from a year earlier. Giventhe better-than-expected results for the half, Honda forecastnet income for the year ending March 31 would rise 5.1% to80.1 billion yen, which exceeds its May prediction of 77billion yen. But, citing the poor outlook for the domesticmarket, Honda said it will reduce the parent company'scapital spending 11% to 80 billion yen from the previouslyplanned level for the year ending March 31. The previous 90billion-yen sum was already 22% below year-earlier capitalspending.   In London, Wellcome soared 52 pence, or 6.5%, to 853 pence($15.12). In a betterthan-expected report, the pharmaceuticalcompany said pretax profit for the year ended Aug. 31 rose28% to #402.9 million ($714.3 million), helped by brisk salesof its Zovirax drug for treatment of herpes infections.

The drug maker and retailersaid pretax profit for the six months ended Sept. 30 climbed2.6% to #162.5 million, as a lighter interest bill made upfor a drop in sales.

Theinsurer's pretax loss for the first nine months widened to#214 million from #91 million a year earlier, as the groupboosted its British mortgage indemnity reserves by #110million.

In Frankfurt, Schering eased 70 pfennigs to 807 marks($493.24). The pharmaceutical company's profit for the firstnine months rose 6% to 214 million marks ($130.8 million).Year-earlier results reflect the sale of the Diamalt unit.For 1991, Schering predicted profit &quot;at the high level of theprevious year&quot; and vowed to pay a dividend of at least 13marks a share, the payout for 1990.   Daimler-Benz was unchanged at 714.50. Boosted by demandfrom a united Germany, the manufacturing giant's profit forthe first nine months rose 4.5% to 1.38 billion marks,despite problems at its unprofitable AEG electronics unit.AEG, which is traded separately, rose 1.90 to 202.   In Paris, Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine rose 24.3 Frenchfrancs to 433 francs ($77.42).

In Amsterdam, Royal Dutch/Shell Group closed at 152guilders ($82.53), up 0.20 guilder.

Including theinventory swings, net plunged 53% to $957 million; ayear-earlier temporary surge in crude prices bloatedinventory values. The results were modestly below forecasts.   In Stockholm, L.M. Ericsson plummeted 14 kronor, or 10%,to 123 kronor ($20.58), as its earnings report stunned thebourse, where the main index skidded 1.47%. Thetelecommunications group's pretax profit for the first ninemonths plunged 53% to 1.51 billion kronor ($252.6 million),because of lower sales and soaring technology costs, up 37%at 1.76 billion kronor. The results were far worse than themarket's expectations for a 30% to 40% decline. Ericsson saidthe poor performance will cause a reduction in developmentprojects next year. For 1991, Ericsson said its earnings&quot;will be considerably lower&quot; than those for 1990 but didn'tspecify a sum.
