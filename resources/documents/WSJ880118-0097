Many fund holders sold shares at year end for tax purposes, to generate net capital losses that can offset as much as $3,000 of ordinary income. This was particularly important last year because deductions were more valuable for many investors as a result of this year's decline in rates for many taxpayers.    Some tax strategies may be dealt a blow, however, by a little-noticed provision of the recent tax-revenue act applying to mutual-fund investors, some fund specialists say.    The act, as widely reported, delayed for at least one year the controversial &quot;phantom income&quot; tax that would require the estimated 20 million mutual fund investors to pay taxes on fund operating costs that are deducted from their investment returns. But the trade-off was a requirement that mutual funds increase, to 98% from 90%, the amount of capital-gains income distributed to shareholders last year. Though funds were required to declare the capital-gains payout by year end, they have until Feb. 1 to make the payout.    So a distribution paid this month but declared in December will be considered received by fund holders in the year of declaration. And those extra distributions are taxable.    Some fund specialists and tax attorneys say throwing back an item of income into an earlier year is unusual. It also could be problematic for some investors who thought they had balanced gains and losses for tax planning -- before these extra distributions occurred.    &quot;Here you are planning your brains out to maximize losses in '87 to offset high taxes, and now you get this payout -- when it's too late to do anything about it,&quot; says Robert Willens, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York. &quot;It's a missing link.&quot;    Some investors grouse that their plans were thrown a curve. &quot;I thought I had it all worked out,&quot; says a Sunrise, Fla., stock-fund holder who had carefully planned her year-end transactions to offset income. &quot;Now it turns out I have an additional slug of capital gains,&quot; she says, triggering an additional $200 in taxes.    Meanwhile, a handful of other fund holders face a rude awakening concerning so-called phantom income tax. This provision would require mutual funds to report their expenses as income to their shareholders, even though the investors never receive the money. Such expenses then would be deductible only to the extent that they, plus other miscellaneous deductions, exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. The one-year delay of this clause applies to mutual funds organized as corporations.    In the past year, however, more than a dozen mutual funds have organized as limited partnerships -- which won't get the benefit of the phantom income reprieve, tax attorneys say.    &quot;Investors going in mutual funds formed as limited partnerships fully expected to be relieved of the (phantom income tax) problem,&quot; says William Moore, a tax attorney for Willkie Farr andamp; Gallagher in New York. &quot;But many haven't had any way of knowing that they won't be getting the same relief.&quot;     ---   SELL SIGNAL: Milton Berg, who managed Oppenheimer Management Co.'s Ninety-Ten Fund to the No. 1 spot in equity mutual funds last year, has turned bearish on the stock market. Last week, he said, &quot;I hope the trade numbers take the market a little higher so it'll give me an opportunity to sell.&quot;    Indeed, as stocks rose sharply at the opening Friday, Mr. Berg began selling 15% to 20% of the stocks in his largest fund, the Premium-Income Fund, which has assets of $376 million. In Ninety-Ten, Mr. Berg remains 5% in call options, which bet that the market as a whole will rise, but he said he is interested in closing out the options position soon in the $8 million fund. The remaining 95% of that portfolio is in money-market instruments.    Mr. Berg achieved a more than 90% gain in the Ninety-Ten Fund last year by correctly timing the market's rise and fall. After Black Monday, Mr. Berg turned bullish again in expectation of a rally. But that recovery, he believes, is over, based on indicators ranging from weak money supply figures to &quot;exceptional down volume&quot; in Jan. 8's 140.58 point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    ---                 Some 1987 Capital Gains                  Payouts are made in 1988                             ASSETS*  DECLARATION  PAYABLE                           in millions)  DATE       DATE Fidelity Equity Income     $4,380    Dec. 23      Jan. 6 American Capital Pace       3,303    Dec. 31      Jan. 15 T.
