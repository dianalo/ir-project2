 Withthe Macintosh IIfx, the company has at last leapfrogged the PC makers with ahardware specification that goes way beyond any PC currently on the market.andO;It may be fully compatible with existing Macintosh software, but inperformance terms the IIfx is heading into new territory for Apple.andM;The market Apple is aiming at with the IIfx is currently occupied by high-end80486-based PCs and low-cost workstations like Sun's SPARCstation 1.andP;  It'sclaimed to be twice as fast as the previous Macintosh software, but inperformance terms the IIfx is heading into new territory for Apple.andM;Indeed, with the new video boards introduced with the IIfx any Apple monitor-- ranging from the 12-inch monochrome to the A3 Two-Page display -- can beplugged into the machine and will work automatically.andP;  If it wasn't for thedifferent name-tag on the front panel a IIfx system with an Apple monitorwould look precisely like a Macintosh IIx; the new system comes in a widecase with room for six expansion slots and 5-1/4-inch hard disk drives,rather than the compact case of the IIcx and IIci which restricts users to3-1/2 inch hard disks.andM;The IIfx runs its central 68030 processor and 68882 maths co-processor at40MHz rather than the 16MHz of the IIx and IIcx and the 25MHz of the IIci.andO;This is faster than the 33MHz of the original F-19 rumours, and the upgradeto 40MHz was a late decision by Apple.andP;  To help make the most of this speedthere are 32Kb of static RAM cache as standard, rather than as an option asit is in the IIci, and a new memory architecture that finally adopts some ofthe go-faster tricks first seen in the early 80386-based PCs.andM;But Apple's emphasis in its IIfx promotion is on 'balance' and besides theincrease in raw processor speed every obvious performance bottleneck in theMacintosh architecture has been bypassed.andP;  The SCSI bus used for hard disks,scanners and other peripherals now has a dedicated direct memory access (DMA)channel, while the serial ports, floppy disk interface and the Apple DesktopBus (ADB) used for the keyboard and mouse have each been given a dedicatedcustom processor to make better use of the central processor's time.andM;With all these processors at work, the 68030 doesn't have to waste clockcycles in handling every interrupt from the keyboard, mouse or floppy diskdrive, while data can be transferred directly from a SCSI device into RAMwithout needing central processor intervention.andP;  For most users this willbecome obvious whenever a floppy disk is inserted into the single 1.44Mb3-1/2-inch drive; the mouse cursor is still responsive while the disk is'mounted' on to the Macintosh desktop, rather than jerking all over thescreen as it does on current Macintosh models.andM;The memory architecture has also been completely redesigned with its owndedicated processor, and this means that single in-line memory modules(SIMMs) from other Macintoshes can't be used in the IIfx.andP;  It also means thatIIfx SIMMs can't be used in other Macintoshes, because each of the eight SIMMsockets in the IIfx has 64 pins rather than the standard Macintosh 30.andM;The 1Mbit RAM chips are 80ns 'fast-page-mode' types, giving the IIfx amaximum motherboard RAM capacity of 8Mb now and 32 or 128Mb as 4Mbit and16Mbit chips arrive.andP;  Using the 68030's 'burst-mode', as the IIci does, theIIfx can read four 32-bit memory blocks in half the clock cycles required ona IIcx.andP;  On top of that, the memory controller uses 'latched writes' so thatthe processor can write to main RAM and read from the cache RAM or ROM at thesame time.andP;  The cache itself uses 20ns static RAM chips, and Apple claimsthat this provides zero wait state operation 95 per cent of the time at40MHz.andP;  An optional extra at purchase is a RAM parity-checking chip, forthose applications -- particularly US Government ones -- where parity-checkedRAM is a condition of purchase.andM;The use of these low-level input and output processors and the new memoryarchitecture means that applications will have to adhere strictly to theMacintosh programming guidelines to run unchanged on the IIfx.andP;  Someapplications bypass the Macintosh Toolbox ROM routines and access the inputand output hardware directly, normally to improve communications performance;these applications will fail on the IIfx as they hit the new processorsinstead of the bare serial, SCSI or ADB chips.andM;With all this emphasis on squeezing extra speed out of every area of thesystem, the one big surprise is that the six NuBus expansion slots still runat 10MHz.andP;  This speed has been fixed since the first Macintosh II appearedwith NuBus slots in 1987, while the NeXT workstation runs its NuBus slots at25MHz.andP;  According to Apple, this difference in speed between the expansionbus and the main processor -- reminiscent of Compaq's 'Flex Architecture' andthe split bus speeds of other fast PCs -- is necessary because the publicNuBus standard doesn't specify a higher speed than 10MHz.andP;  The company saysthat it won't up the speed &quot;until the industry says so&quot;, which is pretty richcoming from a company that's so strict about building and protecting its ownproprietary technology.andM;A more convincing reason is that many existing NuBus boards would fail athigher speeds, just as the fear of possible board failures also explains whyPCs still use an 8MHz AT expansion bus.andM;But whatever the reason, the limited speed of the NuBus slots has led Appleto include a Processor Direct Slot (PDS) just like that in the SE/30 or,rather, not quite like that in the SE/30.andP;  It does give the same directinterface with the 68030 at its full clock speed, and even uses the samephysical connector, but it's described as a 'superset' of the SE/30 PDS andwon't work with SE/30 expansion boards.andM;Apple says that it will be &quot;relatively easy&quot; to convert the boards to work inthe IIfx, but that won't be much consolation for the board makers who haveyet another Apple 'standard' to work to.andP;  There are now four separateexpansion slot types in the Macintosh range -- the 16-bit SE PDS, the 32-bitSE/30 PDS, the 32-bit NuBus and now the 32-bit IIfx PDS -- and their mutualincompatibility makes it difficult for board makers to support them all.andM;However, since the most popular SE and SE/30 add-ons are accelerators andbig-screen graphics boards there won't be much point in producing versionsfor the IIfx PDS; video boards are handled perfectly adequately by NuBus,while accelerators won't really be necessary in the IIfx.andP;  The only add-onsto require the 40MHz speed of the IIfx PDS will be high-performance adjunctsto the main processor, such as Weitek maths co-processors or special-purposeco-processors like the TI MicroExplorer artificial intelligence chip.andM;The new NuBus video boards launched with the IIfx are actually replacementsfor the single video board supplied by Apple to date; they include thecompany's first 24-bit colour board and a reduced instruction set computer(RISC) graphics co-processor board.andP;  The 4/8 and 8/24 boards are actuallyidentical apart from the amount of video RAM each holds, while the 8/24 GChas an AMD29000 32-bit RISC processor that's claimed to accelerate allQuickDraw calls by a factor of between five and 30 depending on theapplication.andM;All three boards will drive any Apple monitor, automatically adjusting to theresolution of whichever monitor is plugged in; the current choice comprisesthe 12-inch grey-scale and 13-inch colour models at a resolution of 640X480,the A4 Portrait Display at 640X870, and the A3 Two-Page Display at 1152X870.andO;The 4/8 board can display 256 colours or shades of grey on the 640X480monitors and 16 shades of grey on the big screens, while the 8/24 and 8/24 GCcan go up to 16.7 million colours at 640X480 and 256 shades of grey on the A4and A3 screens.andM;None of the new video boards were available at the time of review, so anormal 640X480 NuBus board was used.andP;  It was immediately noticeable how theextra speed of the IIfx makes it feasible to use more colours on screen as amatter of course.andP;  Even with a Macintosh IIx or IIcx, many users with256-colour displays actually switch them into four-colour or monochrome modefor text work or for any graphics application that doesn't need the fullcolour choice, simply to get a decent screen updating speed.andP;  With the IIfx,256-colour mode can be used full-time and 24-bit colour should becomepracticable for more general applications.andM;All the applications tried, including Pixel Paint 2.0, Super 3D 2.0,Persuasion 2.0 and HyperCard 1.2.5, worked unchanged although there were somedisplay updating glitches with Super 3D.andM;The operating system was 6.0.5, with a few updates to support the IIfxhardware but no other features over 6.0.3; the IIfx, though, is reallydesigned for the forthcoming System 7.0.andP;  The 512Kb ROM, mounted on a SIMM,contains 32-bit addressing, 32-bit QuickDraw, and virtual memory software ontop of the usual collection of Toolbox routines.andP;  It's ready for System 7.0without the ROM change that will be needed on older machines.andM;As for performance, the IIfx lived up to its billing.andP;  Running a variety ofbenchmark programs put it at around twice the speed of a IIci and aroundthree times the speed of a IIcx, although the figures varied according to thejob mix.andP;  For maths-intensive applications the 40MHz 68882 of the IIfxproduces disproportionate benefits, while on one test -- the drawing of acomplex graphic generated by trigonometrical formulae -- the IIfx was morethan six times the speed of the IIcx.andP;  This was on a test that didn't use themaths chip, and it seems as though all the work was going on in the staticRAM cache of the faster machine, while the IIcx had to go to slower main RAMfor each calculation.andM;In general use, for such things as opening and closing windows and movingicons from place to place, the IIfx didn't seem spectacularly fast.andP;  But giveit some tough work to do, such as scrolling complex 256-colour images ortilting and rotating rendered 3D images in colour, and the speed advantage ismarked.andP;  For 24-bit colour work a IIfx could make the difference betweenpracticability and giving up, and the 8/24 GC should help even more.andM;The pricing of the IIfx, however, should cause some readjustments throughoutApple's bloated range.andP;  There are three IIfx configurations available, allwith 4Mb of RAM as standard.andP;  One has no hard disk, allowing dealers andusers to fit their own particular choice of drive, while the others have 80Mbor 160Mb of storage.andM;The prices for these configurations are 5,610 pounds, 6,290 pounds, and 6,970pounds respectively, not too much more than prices for similarly-configuredMacintosh IIx system units a year ago.andP;  The 4/8 board will cost 460 pounds,the 8/24 board will cost 610 pounds and the 8/24 GC will cost 1,345 pounds.andM;To give some idea of a typical system price, a IIfx with an 80Mb hard disk,8/24 video card, 13-inch 640X480 colour monitor, keyboard, mouse, systemsoftware and HyperCard will cost roughly 7,800 pounds.andP;  That doesn't comparebadly with the price of 33MHz 80386 or 25MHz 80486 name-brand PCs, and Appleis now in a position to say that it has system speeds that can't be matchedby the current PC market.andM;However, the IIx price must fall to accommodate the IIfx, and there must alsobe adjustments to IIci and IIcx prices.andP;  The new video board prices areaggressively low, with the 24-bit colour board undercutting the nearestcompetitor by around 200 pounds, and this should help Apple sell more bigmonitors.andM;But marketing aside, the IIfx should sell because Apple has finally stoppedbeing so conservative and has actually gone for performance in almost everyarea of the machine.andP;  It's still a Macintosh, but the IIfx makes theMacintosh experience a pleasure -- even in those applications that havecaused its predecessors to choke.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
