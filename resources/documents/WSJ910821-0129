German monetary policy and interest rates are closelywatched internationally because of their influence on marketsand currencies abroad. Likewise, the condition of the Germaneconomy is of great interest to other nations because theunified country and its appetite for products has been anengine for growth amid a general recession in Europe.</LP><TEXT>   The crisis in the Soviet Union has sent the mark reeling,undermining the German central bank's recent efforts tosupport the currency. The central bank last week raised bothof its key interest rates and drained funds from the bankingsystem to bolster the mark and try to curb inflation bymaking imports less expensive. But what the Bundesbank can donow remains to be seen.   In the short term, the potential for prolonged East-Westtensions or even civil war in the Soviet Union confrontsGermany's central bank with a quandary: Another rise inGerman interest rates may or may not help the mark, but itwould almost certainly pose new problems for Germany'seconomy.   &quot;There is no reason to act now,&quot; said Karl Thomas, bankpresident for the state of Hesse and a member of theBundesbank's policy-setting Central Bank Council. But he saidthat &quot;it is clear that the {inflationary} risks are greateras a result&quot; of the Soviet uncertainty.   The longer-term question is how the Bundesbank wouldrespond if a flight of Western money depressed capitalmarkets, sending market interest rates higher just as theBonn government must depend on borrowing to finance easternGermany's reconstruction. Easing monetary policy wouldn'tfurther the Bundesbank's primary task of keeping the currencystable and capital outflows to a minimum.   Mr. Thomas said the Bundesbank hopes that the Sovietcrisis won't escalate and that a &quot;more realistic&quot; balancewill soon return to currency and securities markets. Marketeconomists say Bundesbank policy makers have little choicebut to wait and hope.   &quot;There has to be a sense of frustration at the Bundesbank.But all they can do is wait and see what develops in theSoviet Union,&quot; said Jonathan Hoffman, a currency economistfor Credit Suisse First Boston in London. &quot;The last thingthey will want to do is raise rates again, with securitiesmarkets in this delicate state.&quot;   Dieter Wermuth, an economist for Manufacturers HanoverTrust G.m.b.H. in Frankfurt, said the German economy alreadyis cooling and that another rate increase could acceleratethe slowdown. Bundesbank officials &quot;just have to accept itand hope it solves itself,&quot; he said.   Yesterday, markets showed signs of returning to stability.The U.S. dollar closed in Frankfurt at about 1.80 marks, downfrom levels above 1.82 marks on Monday but still up fivepfennigs from late last week. Germany's bond and stockmarkets also recouped some of their Monday losses.   A worst-case scenario for the German economy would be aprotracted and bloody power struggle in the Soviet Uniontriggering a new flood of Soviet and Eastern Europeanrefugees into Germany. Even then, however, many analysts saythey wouldn't expect the Bundesbank to react with higherrates, saying that central bank actions wouldn't be enough tosway a skittish market driven by political factors.   &quot;Then it would be a fate for the currency that we wouldhave to live with,&quot; said Peter Pietsch, economist atCommerzbank AG. He pointed out that if the current 3 1/2percentage point spread between lower U.S. and higher Germanshort-term market rates isn't enough to bolster the Germancurrency, &quot;then another quarter-point or half-point increasewon't make any difference.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
