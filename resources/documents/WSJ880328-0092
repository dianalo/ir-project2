The nationalization has polarized the country and drawn continued heated protest from former owners and many bank employees, who charge the move is unconstitutional.    Court challenges to the law and noncooperation by former owners have bogged down the expropriation process. Banco de Credito and Banco Wiese, the largest of the nationalized banks, are the only banks where the government has taken control.    Analysts said Mr. Garcia softened the measure to quiet the strident protests. Employees at other nationalized concerns could also be given control of their companies in the future, they added.    Mr. Garcia, of the center-left ruling party, said the nationalization was needed because powerful monopolies were using bank funds and national savings for their own benefit or to dominate other productive sectors.    The powerful centrist and rightist opposition charges that the Garcia government nationalized the private financial system to retain power for his party by manipulating the availability of loans. </TEXT></DOC>
