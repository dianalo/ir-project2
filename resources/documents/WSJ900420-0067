In written answers to questions posed by the SenateBanking Committee, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed believes banksare reacting to changing economic conditions, bad loans and&quot;ongoing scrutiny by regulators.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Such tightening could reduce the amount of creditprovided to businesses and consumers . . . with potentialeffects on the level of local economic activity,&quot; Mr.Greenspan said. But responding to a query about Massachusettsfrom Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.), the Fed chairman said acredit crunch &quot;would most likely need to be prolonged andmore severe than we have been able to detect&quot; before itthreatens the economic stability of New England.   Mr. Greenspan, who said the Fed seeks a prudent balancebetween too much restraint on the part of bankers and toolittle, noted that bank lending essentially didn't grow atall in December and January. In February, it grew at anannual rate of 5.3%. For all of 1989, he noted, bank lendingrose 7.6%. Loan growth in the Northeast and Southwest hasbeen weaker than the national average. That can reflectbankers' reluctance to lend or customers' reluctance toborrow in an uncertain economy or both.   Mr. Greenspan added that the large losses reported bythrifts throughout the 1980s and, more recently, bycommercial banks &quot;suggests that financing activity in thereal estate industry, in particular, has been excessive.&quot;   Mr. Greenspan disclosed new Fed data showing that the 50largest bank-holding companies at the end of last year had$125.5 billion in loans outstanding to highly leveragedtransactions, a 50% increase from the end of 1988. So far,those loans, which include bank lending for debt-financedtakeovers, are performing better than other kinds of loans,the Fed data show. But the proportion of loans for highlyleveraged transactions that are going sour is on the rise.   The Fed currently is conducting special examinations ofcertain banks with high concentrations of such loans &quot;todetermine if significant deterioration is taking place,&quot; theFed chairman said.</TEXT></DOC>
