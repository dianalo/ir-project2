IBP Inc. says OSHA is trying to impose ``Alice in Wonderlandtheories'' on industry, but the union representing workers at IBP'sDakota City, Neb., meatpacking plant hailed Wednesday's decision toget tough with the company.   OSHA said it was imposing a $3.1 million fine against IBP forwillfully ignoring the hazards of repetitive motion. The agencymaintains that IBP could have taken numerous steps to reduce therisk of injury, but did not.   The affected employees work on production lines, doing such workas cutting, trimming, hide removal and lifting meat with hooks,said OSHA spokesman Terry Mikelson. All the work is done while themeat moves at high speed through work stations in a cold, dampenvironment.   Mikelson said safety inspectors from the agency first ``noticeda pattern of repetitive motion injuries'' during a preliminaryreview of safety records in November 1987. Such injuries can becrippling and are caused by repeated hand, wrist and arm motion.   OSHA Deputy Assistant Secretary Frank White said repetitivemotion injuries are ``a major health hazard in one of the mostdangerous occupations in the country, and we want the meatpackingindustry, in general, and IBP, in particular, to eliminate theproblem.''   OSHA says IBP refused to slow its production lines, changeequipment designs or educate workers about the need to changepositions periodically.   ``IBP has known about the high toll that these disorders havehad on its work force but has chosen not to deal with it,'' Whitesaid.   ``We're most pleased about the recommendations the OccupationalSafety and Health Administration made in their lengthy complaintagainst IBP _ recommendations for some very simple ways ofpreventing injuries,'' said Al Zack, a spokesman for the UnitedFood and Commercial Workers Union.   IBP, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Co., has 15 workingdays to contest the fine. The company already is contesting a $2.6million fine levied by OSHA last July for safety and recordviolations at the Dakota City plant.   In a statement issued late Wednesday, IBP officials indicatedthey will fight the case in court.   The citation, the company statement said, ``represents amisguided attempt by OSHA to force the meatpacking industry toblindly accept untested theories about the prevention of repetitivemotion disorders.''   ``OSHA's goal,'' the statement continued, ``is to intimidatecompanies by threatening enormous penalties unless they acceptAlice in Wonderland theories.''   The company said it has urged OSHA to develop a special programfor the meatpacking industry, but that OSHA has not done that.   Zack said the union is disappointed that IBP continues to ``denythere is a problem. It would be far preferable if IBP would startworking on solutions.''   After the preliminary study revelaed a pattern of injuries, OSHAhired an expert in ergonomics, David Cochran, of the University ofNebraska at Lincoln, to do more extensive studies, Mikelson said.   The studies found that 620 workers at 45 work stations at theDakota City plant were ``at grave risk'' of developing repetitivemotion illnesses, he said. Of those, 377 workers actually haddeveloped injuries, Mikelson said. Some required surgery, some areon restricted work schedules and some are on permanent disabilityleave, he said.   The $3.1 million fine represents a $5,000 penalty for each ofthe 620 workers.   Mikelson estimated that a total of 3,000 people work at theDakota City plant, one of 15 IBP plants.   Workers at the Dakota City plant went on strike in the winter of1987, following a bitter lockout by IBP. The strike ended last July.   The fine is the second largest OSHA has ever imposed against anindividual company. The largest was $4.2 million against Bath IronWorks in Bath, Maine, in November 1987 for health and safetyviolations.   The largest fine against multiple companies came in March ofthis year _ $5.11 million against five contractors that worked on aBrideport, Conn., apartment building that collapsed in April 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
