In Thailand, a government official has just suggested that Vietnamese refugees be exiled to &quot;rented&quot; desert islands. In Hong Kong, the British government has begun to treat all boat people as &quot;illegals&quot; and consign them to fetid camps. These Vietnamese no longer qualify as &quot;political&quot; refugees, explained Chief Secretary Sir David Ford. &quot;They are simply people seeking a better life.&quot;    Indeed, Americans would say, a better life. The rest of the world may reject the Vietnamese, but the genius of America has always been in accepting the boat people of the world who were simply seeking a better life. It began with the Mayflower. In return, they have helped build a better America.    This has proven true through our history, but the latest evidence has come from our most recent wave of immigrants -- in particular those from Asia. Nativists feared they couldn't assimilate into a Western culture, but now we learn that their children are often our best students. In San Diego's high schools, one in every four valedictorians and salutatorians has recently been Vietnamese. Children of Asian ethnicity do better in school, are less likely to drop out and have fewer run-ins with police, according to recent studies at Princeton and San Diego State University.    Say the San Diego researchers: &quot;Immigrants and refugees to the U.S. -- whether from Asia, Europe, or Latin America -- are systematically outperforming all native-born American students in grade-point averages despite . . . English-language handicaps.&quot;    The New York Times recently carried a photograph, a kind of American mosaic, of this year's Westinghouse Foundation high-school science award finalists. In the 1960s and 1970s, the winners tended to be the sons and daughters of European immigrants. Now they include the children of Asian immigrants. This year's 40 winners included seven who were born (or whose parents were born) in Taiwan, two in China, three in Korea, one in Vietnam, two in India, and one each in Guyana, Poland, Trinidad, Canada, Peru, Iran and Honduras. That's 22 of 40.    These will be America's future scientists and engineers, as indeed their parents may be today's. In 1986 alone, immigrants to America included more than 11,000 engineers, scientists and computer specialists. That doesn't count the tens of thousands who come each year to study at our universities, then stay here to work, teach or start businesses.    Our &quot;economic nationalists&quot; would block their entry, but without them we couldn't fill the teaching posts of our universities, the engineering and science staffs in American companies, or even our hospitals. Without them, America would be less competitive in biotechnology, computer science, superconductivity, everything.    Protectionists worry that Korea may sell us a few more shoes than we sell it oranges, but the Koreans themselves understand that the real competition in world markets is for human capital. That's why they're doing everything possible to lure U.S.-educated Ph.D.s back to Seoul. America's primary -- its overwhelming -- competitive advantage is in remaining a mecca for the world's human talent and knowledge.    Ah, but what of &quot;illegals,&quot; the poor and unskilled teeming masses? We know that some of their children will also be valedictorians, just as the children of boat people have been. But we also know they are eager right now to take the jobs unfilled as the nation's labor shortage worsens. The 1986 immigration &quot;reform&quot; isn't stopping Mexicans from coming over the border, the papers report, because the lure of American opportunity is too strong. A nation in which jobs that pay $5 and $6 an hour go begging has too few immigrants, not too many.    Immigration is never without problems. Communities where large numbers settle over short periods can find their services taxed, though the experience of California suggests this burden, too, is manageable. More troubling is that some immigrants have become trapped in a destructive welfare system, though even here at rates lower than the wider population.    The larger story, though, is one of epic success. The politicians and interests who would spurn immigrants boast of keeping America strong, but their policies would actually make it weaker -- spiritually, to be sure, but also economically. Chinese immigrants in the 19th century spoke of America as &quot;Gold Mountain.&quot; They not only found it but also helped build it, as their successors do today. </TEXT></DOC>
