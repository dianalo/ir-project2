In contrast to a non-exposed comparison group of postal workers,asbestos workers exhibited significantly elevated levels of somatic concern(P less than .03), and significantly lower levels of mental health functioningonly when experiencing high levels of stress (P less than .01). Despitefeeling significantly more susceptible to developing cancer (P less than.0001), 34% of asbestos workers were cigarette smokers (compared to 32%of the postal group) and long-term mask usage was minimal. Asbestos workers'increased sensitivity to stress and changes in health status along withthe lack of adaptation of health-promotive behaviors indicate the needfor interventions to attend to the psychologic effects of increased riskstatus.</TEXT></DOC>
