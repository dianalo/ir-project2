Exports, at 16.5 billion guilders ($8.75 billion), were unchanged from the year before and up 25% from August. Imports totaled 16.1 billion guilders, up 5.9% from a year earlier and 17% from August.    In 1987's first nine months, Dutch trade was in surplus by two billion guilders, down sharply from 12.1 billion guilders a year earlier.    Forecasts have said that the surplus will be around two billion guilders for all of 1987, down from 12.6 billion guilders last year, mainly because of the Dutch currency's strength. </TEXT></DOC>
