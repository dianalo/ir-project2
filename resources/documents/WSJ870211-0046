The insurance and financial services company had a net loss of $18.3 million in the year-earlier period. There weren't any per-share earnings in the most recent quarter as a result of the distribution of preferred-stock dividends.    The most recent quarter's profit included a one-time charge of $40.9 million from early redemption of 17% debentures. Before that charge, fourth-quarter profit was $47.2 million, or 53 cents a share.    For the year, net income rose 45% to $63 million, or 50 cents a share, from $43.4 million, or 21 cents a share. Annual profit before the one-time charge from redemption of debentures more than doubled to $103.9 million, or $1.14 a share. There weren't any one-time charges in the yearearlier quarter or full year.    The company said the profit increase was achieved despite substantial underwriting losses, which included a $100 million pre-tax charge to strengthen the liability for unpaid claims and related expenses. </TEXT></DOC>
