Is that particularly bothersomedepartment head yelling that &quot;we need a new phone system&quot; because his callscan't get through? Does your phone system sales rep tell you, &quot;Well, we dooffer that feature, but not on your software release.andP;  We can do an upgrade.andO;Of course, that will be expensive...&quot;andM;Add-ons or, if we want to be fancy about it - telephone peripheralenhancements, can save you anywhere from hundreds of dollars to hundreds ofthousands of dollars.andP;  Sometimes, an add-on device can mean  the  differencebetween keeping your old - but satisfactory - PBX without having to spend thereally big bucks on a new one.andM;Depending on the PBX (and model and software release and feature package ...andO;well, you get the idea), your phone system may have the inherent features toget the job done on a particular application.andP;  However, if the application isanything but the most basic, the application requirements often can not bemet by the PBX.andP;  Or the cost of a PBX-provided solution hurts worse than theproblem itself.andM;Enter the TSI (Telecommunication System Integrator).andP;  The TSI is not limitedto a particular phone system.andP;  In fact, most TSIs do not sell phone systemsat all.andP;  This can work to your advantage.andP;  The TSI does not see the add-onsale as a &quot;little sale&quot; or a distraction.andP;  The peripheral sale is his wholebusiness, his expertise, not to mention his bread and butter.andM;Armed with a sophisticated &quot;bag of tricks,&quot; the TSI is able to draw on a widerange of both products and manufacturers to satisfy a particular application.andO;So, without further ado, here are 10 of the more common &quot;hurts&quot; that can beaddressed with the antibiotic salve of a PBX add-on.andP;  1.andP;  AutomatedAttendant.andP;  We are all, by now, familiar with the automated  attendant.andO;Suddenly, they seem to be everywhere.andP;  At the bank, when you call the IRS,even popping up on late night TV ads for 900 services that say, &quot;Be sure tocall from a touchtone phone.&quot;andM;The most common application for automated attendant is still answering on themain number.andP;  &quot;Thank you for calling Really Big Enterprises.andP;  If you know theextension...&quot; More PBXs have had their lives extended by automated attendantsthan by all other peripheral devices combined.andM;If the operator can not handle the call traffic to the console, taking awayher old Dimension console and giving her a brand new ATandamp;T Definity consolewill have exactly zero impact on the problem.andP;  Adding a second operator - inthe long run, probably the most expensive option - will expand the ability toanswer calls by the tremendous number of one simultaneous call.andM;Conversely, an eight-port automated attendant can process an additional eightsimultaneous calls.andP;  You still need the operator to handle the overflow, butthe problem of calls being blocked at the console is solved.andP;  2.andP;  Voice Mail.andO;Most major PBX providers offer voice mail as an option.andP;  The cost ofTSI-provided voice mail may be lower, but this needs to be evaluated on acase-by-case basis.andP;  One caution just because you are lucky enough to have agreat tech for your PBX, doesn't mean he knows a thing about the wide,wonderful world of voice mail.andM;As many communications managers will attest, there are few biggerfrustrations that trying to cost justify voice mail.andP;  There is simply no harddollar savings in &quot;improved secretarial efficiency.&quot; However, there are acouple of niche applications where there are hard-dollar savings.andM;If you have an order-taking application, the callers can be asked a series ofquestions by voice mail and the order can be placed automatically.andP;  Or, ifyou have a dispatch center, you can reduce or eliminate the late shift byhaving callers leave messages requesting service.andP;  The voice mail system canthen automatically outdial a series of pages and/or phone numbers until atech calls in for the message.andP;  3.andP;  Interactive  Voice Response.andP;  The sexiestof all the add-ons.andP;  Initially, IVR seems similar to automated attendant.andO;The difference is that IVR accesses information from a mainframe or otherdatabase and gives the caller spoken information that is particular to thatcaller.andM;If voice mail is the most difficult to cost justify, IVR is the easiest.andP;  IVRis perhaps the only peripheral device that can completely replace thefunction of a person.andP;  In these days of reduced head count, that is a trueblessing.andM;The best response to upper management's almost invariable resistance to&quot;having our customers handled by a machine&quot; is to offer IVR as an additionaloption.andP;  If during business hours, there is always the option to speak to aperson, IVR can only be seen as an improvement to the level of service toyour customers.andP;  Not to mention the additional benefit that IVR works 24hours a day, 7 days a week and, you hope, never gets sick.andP;  4.andP;  Call DetailReporting (CDR).andP;  The most obvious cost justification for CDR is to monitoremployee phone abuse.andP;  The irony is that once CDR is in place and employeesare made aware that management is monitoring phone calls - hardly anyone isstill inclined to call their Great Aunt Minnie in Honolulu.andM;Standalone CDR systems offer features that are not found in most PBXofferings.andP;  In addition, if the application requires a network of CDR systemson dissimilar PBXs, a standalone CDR system is the way to go.andP;  5.andP;  CallDiverter.andP;  The call diverter is a little known but simple device that can bea real money saver.andP;  A call diverter accepts a call on one trunk and thenautomatically &quot;patches&quot; the call through to a different destination bydialing a pre-programmed number on a second trunk.andM;Your phone system can do this if it has a feature called &quot;Trunk-toTrunkTransfer.&quot; However, if the PBX does not have this feature, or if a softwareupgrade is required, call diverters may offer an inexpensive solution.andM;For example, imagine that customer service is using an automated attendant.andO;There has been a problem in the past because the billing department is in adifferent 54 building (and on a different PBX).andP;  Of course, the automatedattendant could simply announce to the caller the separate phone number forbilling and hang up.andP;  However, with a call diverter the customer could &quot;Press4&quot; for billing and be automatically transferred.andP;  This transfer would betransparent to the caller.andP;  6.andP;  Digital Announcer.andP;  In an application whereyour first thought would be to use an automated attendant, it can pay to takea look at a digital announcer.andP;  Far less expensive than automated attendant,a digital announcer can answer multiple calls and broadcast information.andP;  Theinformation will always play from the beginning (that's why they call themdigital announcers) and can be up to approximately 10 minutes in duration.andO;Some digital announcers even offer a simple, one-level automatedattendant-type menu of options.andP;  7.andP;  Answering  Machines.andP;  lets not forgetthe simplest of all add-ons, the old standby, the telephone answeringmachine.andP;  Voice mail is rapidly relegating answering machines to the storagecloset in many organizations.andP;  However, the answering machine should not bethought of as obsolete.andP;  With the cost of voice-mail hard-disk storageranging between $1,000 and $2,000 per hour, it can sometimes be veryeffective to use answering machines in conjunction with voice mail.andM;For example, if you have an application where customers often call to requestthat literature be mailed to them, rather than take these calls on voicemail, the callers could be forwarded to answering machines.andP;  This will resultin a cost of $100 per hour rather than thousands for voice mail.andP;  Inaddition, it can be more convenient for clerical staff to transcribeinformation from a cassette tape than from a mailbox on voice mail.andP;  Someanswering machines even offer a question-and-answer format.andP;  8.andP;  AutomaticCall Distributor (ACD).andP;  ACD offers inbound call centers the ability toanswer incoming calls with a message.andP;  Unlike the automated attendant, thismessage will invite the caller to hold for the next available representative.andO;Supervisory CRT monitors and agent reports are standard ACD features.andM;Certain PBXs provide excellent ACD software and optional packages.andP;  Examplesof PBXs that offer sophisticated ACD options would be the Northern TelecomSL-l and the ATandamp;T Definity.andP;  For those PBXs that do not offer fully featuredACD, the power of a standalone ACD can provide the user with greater controlover the call traffic and expanded system and agent reports.andP;  It is alsocomforting to know that peak call traffic on the standalone ACD will notnegatively impact the PBX's ability to handle the non-ACD call traffic.andP;  9.andO;Automatic Call Sequencer (ACS).andP;  Put simply - and bluntly - the callsequencer is a poor man's ACD.&quot; At a greatly reduced cost, the call sequencersounds to the caller like a million dollar ACD used by the major airlines.andO;It's as a management tool that the call sequencer falls short.andM;The call sequencer will monitor incoming calls, answer with an announcement,put the caller on hold and provide a simple system report.andP;  For the rightapplication where the sophistication of an ACD is not required - there's nobetter bang for the buck.andP;  (By the way, that's a technical term.) 10.andP;  VoiceLogging.andP;  Voice recording is one area that the PBX manufacturers have - sofar -  simply avoided altogether.andP;  Voice recording units let you record allphone conversations on reel-to-reel tape (or in the unique case of TEAC, onan ordinary VHS tape).andM;It is more and more common for customer service to use voice recording tomonitor agent performance, to aid in training new employees and to ensure ahigher level of professionalism and service to customers.andP;  Of course, as withvoice mail, there is no hard-dollar cost justification here.andM;On the other hand, as anyone familiar with the brokerage environment knows,when financial transactions are taking place over the phone, there's noeasier cost justification than the &quot;insurance policy&quot; of a voice logger.andM;In one case of an installation to a brokerage house, the communicationsmanager asked to have the voice recorder turned on as a test.andP;  In the first45 seconds of operation, the last half of a conversation was recorded.andP;  Inthat conversation there was a discrepancy that - due to the recording - savedthe company 45 thousand dollars.andP;  This was five thousand dollars more thanthe cost of the voice logger.andP;  The result one very happy communicationsmanager.andP;  John is president of new TSI ProtoCall, serving the New York, NewJersey area with a wide range telephone peripherals.andP;  They're also intocomputer consulting.andP;  So if you have two separate programs that need to talkto each other, they'll develop software for you.andP;  Prior to foundingProtoCall, John was the top seller for AB Communications.andP;  ProroCall may bereached at 718-625-5600.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
