On one hand, the nation is building a stockpile of chemicalweapons.   On the other, it condemns countries such as Libya and Iraq forproducing chemical arms.   Intellectual conflicts like that aside, the world's superpowersand other nations finally seem positioned to make major progresstoward a ban on chemical weapons.   Encouragingly, President Bush's condemnation of such weaponslast week before the United Nations General Assembly was wellreceived.   Bush offered to cut U.S. stocks of chemical weapons by more than80 percent if the Soviet Union would do the same.   The Soviet Union, in turn, said it would radically reduce orcompletely destory its chemical weapons, halt nuclear tests andstop making weapons-grade plutonium and uranium if the UnitedStates would do the same.   Bush's proposal would require that the Soviet Union make deepercuts than the United States, because the Soviets have more chemicalweapons. That might be a stumbling block toward further progress.So will the very breadth of the Soviet proposal, which also wouldaffect nuclear weapons.   But some of the biggest obstacles had to be overcome just to getthis far. Continued progress is welcome, whether it is wrapped inhypocrisy or not.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 2   Seattle Post-Intelligencer on Colombia:   The cocaine-beseiged president of Colombia, Virgilio Barco, madesome eminently reasonable requests of the United States on hisvisit to Washington last week.   Barco, who is trying to get tough with the drug lords who allbut run his country, did not come seeking more financial aid.Instead, he asked for help of a different sort than merely throwingmoney at the problem.   Barco rightly enough wants the U.S. to restore a coffee-exportquota system that favors Colombia. When the U.S. blocked renewal ofthe quota agreement last July, world coffee prices plummeted. Theeffect of this in Colombia is to turn more coffee farmers intococaine farmers, a development that is not in this nation'sself-interest.   Barco also asked President Bush to curtail the export from theU.S. to Colombia of chemicals used to manufacture cocaine and tolimit production of the automatic weapons used by the drug lords.   And Barco asked members of Congress for greater efforts toeducate Americans against the use of drugs to help shut off themarket.   In taking on the drug lords, Barco is risking his life. Theleast this government can do is support policies that make Barco'sunenviable task less daunting.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 1   The Providence (R.I.) Sunday Journal on the capital gains tax:   In retrospect, it is hardly surprising that President Bush'scapital gains tax cut should win so handily in the House ofRepresentatives last week.   Politicians can scarcely resist voting for a plan to getsomething for nothing, and despite all the rhetoric to thecontrary, that is just what this tax cut offered. ...   The ``rich'' that (Majority Leader Richard) Gephardt insistswill be the only beneficiaries of a capital gains tax cut includelow- and middle-income earners who would benefit only after cashingin their investments. ...   Many of these same people voted for George Bush last November,and (the) unexpectedly lopsided vote on capital gains may indicatethat their interests are being recognized by a growing number oflegislators.   This trend, if it spreads to related tax and budget issues,could provide the president with a working majority in Congress,similar to the one forged by Ronald Reagan in 1981.   We believe the economic policies that would emerge from CapitolHill under those circumstances would be good for the country.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 28   Hobbs (N.M.) Daily News-Sun on mail and telephone frauds:   Careless about who spends your money?   You are if you give out your credit card numbers to strangerswho solicit your business over the telephone, and you are if yousend out checks to ``official looking'' contest companies whoinform you that you can collect a fat prize if you will only sendthem money to pay for processing your award.   These scams and hundreds more just like them are literallyflooding the U.S. mails today, going out to countless millions ofunsuspecting Americans, and there is little difficulty in theserip-off artists reaching almost everyone with a post office address.   It's a crying shame that billions of dollars are being bilkedout of millions of Americans by reason of an all-out assault onthem through the mails and via telephones; and two things make itpossible: Federal regulations are not sufficiently strict toprevent massive mail and telephone fraud, and too many people (thevictims) still believe there is a free lunch.   We urge Congress to devise effective anti-fraud laws for thenation's communications systems to prevent the robbery of innocentpeople.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
