The two countries' semiannual subcabinet-level economic talks,which began Friday, also aired questions about continuing massiveJapanese trade surpluses and U.S. budget deficits, said officialsof both countries who talked to reporters on condition they not benamed.   The sources said the Japanese side asked why Americans were soconcerned about such investments as Sony Corporation's acquisitionof Columbia Pictures or Mitsubishi Real Estate's purchase ofRockefeller Center, since as a debtor nation America needs thecapital inflow.   ``Our attitude was that we welcome foreign investment, but it isbecoming increasingly difficult to defend it in the U.S. againstthe perception that Americans do not have the same opportunity inJapan,'' the U.S. informant said.   Even though Japan has a powerful economy second only toAmerica's, it does not even appear on the list of the 15 leadingnations that host foreign investment, the Japanese were told. U.S.businessmen have complained of waiting for years to get Japaneseapproval of investment proposals.   McCormack's delegation also warned the Japanese that ``politicalalarms'' could sound in Congress if recent reports are borne outthat the Japanese trade surplus will resume growing next year andthat excess capacity will prompt Japan to turn from domestic demandback to exports for economic growth.   The reply was that Japan would continue to stimulate domesticdemand and boost imports from the United States, especiallyhigh-ticket capital goods, the sources said.   The two countries agreed on broad cooperation in the forthcominground of global trade talks, sources said.   Richard McCormack, U.S. undersecretary of state for economicaffairs, presided over the talks, which were attended byrepresentatives of a half dozen departments of the two countries'governments. Deputy Foreign Minister Koji Watanabe headed theJapanese delegation.   Most of the same officials return Monday and Tuesday for thesecond session of the Structural Impediment Initiative, talks beguntwo months ago in Tokyo on non-trade causes contributing to the $50billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
