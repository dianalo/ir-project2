The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 27.3points, or 1.3 percent, at 2,033.7, the day's lowest level. At itsbest, the index was down 4.4 points.   Volume was little changed from the previous day at 547.8 millionshares, compared with Tuesday's 543.3 million shares.   Sparking the latest bout of nerves was news of a 0.6 percent risein U.S. consumer prices in January and a subsequent comment byFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that he found the increasedisturbing.   In addition, further declines in the level of the British poundagainst the West German mark were taken to mean the government hadroom to leave interest rates high for the time being.   But the widespread declines in equities took place in lighttrading volume. What institutional selling there was was met byreciprocal buying interest. Markdowns by market makers accounted formuch of the price falls, dealers said.   ``The momentum isn't really there this week. People are willingto stand on the sidelines,'' one dealer said.</TEXT></DOC>
