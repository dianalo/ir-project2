This Order implements and supplements requirementsfound in 43 CFR Part 3160 relating to the measurement of oil produced underthe terms of Federal and Indian (except Osage) oil and gas leases, as wellas oil produced from State or privately owned lands when Federal and/orIndian leases receive a share of such production under the terms of anapproved agreement. The Order addresses oil measurement by tank gauging,by positive displacement metering systems, and by other methods acceptableto the authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management. The Bureauof Land Management's existing internal guidelines on oil measurement werenever published as a Notice to Lessees and Operators. Thus, this Orderhas no direct predecessor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 23, 1989.

At the request ofseveral respondents, BLM published a <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice on April 6, 1988 (53 FR 11318), whichextended the comment period through April 19, 1988. During the comment period, 31 written comments were received: 23 from businessentities, 3 from associations, 1 from a State agency, and 4 from officesof Federal agencies. The Bureau appreciates the time and effort spent bythe respondents in reviewing the proposed rulemaking and the highly detailedresponses offering constructive suggestions for improvement. Many of thecomments, both technical and editorial, were adopted and are reflectedin the final rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of General Comments </ITAG>A number of comments supported formalizing measurement requirements andstated that promulgating rules will facilitate a better understanding ofthe requirements. Several comments objected to the entire concept of theproposed rulemaking, arguing that it is unnecessary. One comment statedthat the proposed rule in its present form was not authorized by the statutes.The necessary authority exists at 30 U.S.C. 1711 and 30 U.S.C. 189. Thefinal rulemaking will be of overall benefit to both the oil and gas companiesand the various Government agencies, by providing the minimum standardscritical to accurate measurement and reporting of production nationwide.Custody Transfer/Allocation Meters Numerous comments argued that the Order should only apply to custody transfermeasurements and not allocation measurements. They stated that the proposedrules are for application to single phase, homogeneous oil, gas, or condensateflows that have been cleaned up and stabilized for commercial pipelinetransport. They argued further that allocation meters may involve the flowof vapor and liquids, two-phase flow, and therefore that the allocationmeter should not be held to the same tolerances as the custody transferor sales meter. A custody transfer or sales meter is one from whose measurementsroyalty is determined directly. An allocation meter is a meter wherebyproduction is measured and credited to a lease(s) or well(s). BLM has theresponsibility to designate or accept measurement points (meters) fromwhose measurements royalties will be determined. All such designated measurementpoints are required to meet the minimum standards of this Order. The designatedor accepted measurement point may be a custody transfer meter, a salesmeter or an allocation meter. In any case, the meters are required to bemeasuring single phase flow. BLM requires that all production removed orsold from the lease be placed into marketable condition using appropriatelysized and maintained production equipment, and the oil, water, and gasseparated prior to measurement, or that a variance be approved. To clarifythat the proposed standards apply to allocation as well as sales meters,the phrase ``and allocation'' has been added to paragraph 2 of sectionIII.B. Responsibility for Proper Measurement Numerous comments were received expressing concern because the proposedOrder provided that the lessee/operator is responsible for the handlingand proper measurement of lease production, when in some cases the salesmeters are owned and operated by the purchaser/transporter. In such cases,the operator may not have control over the measurement equipment. Mostcomments urged that the responsibility for proper sales measurement shouldbe placed on the owner of the sales meter and that only the responsibilityfor allocation measurement should be placed on the lessee/operator. BLMrecognizes that the purchaser often owns and maintains the custody transferor sales meter. However, requirements for proper measurement are normallyincluded in the purchase contract. Existing regulations at 43 CFR 3162.1hold the lessee/operator responsible for assuring that all oil and gasproduction operations on Federal or Indian leases, including proper measurement,comply with Department of the Interior regulations, whether conducted bythe lessee or by parties having contractual agreements with the lessee.This Order does not change the responsibility of the lessee. First, thestandards in this Order are generally API standards. Second, normal salescontracts require the purchaser to maintain the sales meter properly, andthird, historically, holding the lessee/operator responsible for propermeasurement has not created significant problems for the operators or purchasers.The operator is often unable physically to correct violations resultingfrom meter problems, and this has been taken into account in setting abatementperiods. In addition, 43 CFR 3163.2(f)(1) provides civil penalties up to$25,000 for any person who knowingly or willfully prepares, maintains,or submits false, inaccurate or misleading reports. This regulation appliesto the purchaser as well as the lessee/operator. Phase-in Period Specific comments were requested as to a phase-in period of time afterwhich this Order will become effective. Ten comments were received recommendingeither no phase-in period or one ranging up to two years. The rationalefor a phase-in period offered in the comments included time to installand upgrade equipment, resolve contractual issues, to train field and accountingpersonnel, and obtain variance approvals. The BLM agrees that a phase-intime period is appropriate for the installation of new equipment or themodification of existing equipment, and the training of field personnel.The phase-in period will also allow those companies desiring to do so toobtain justifiable variances and be in full compliance on the effectivedate of this Order. Accordingly, all sales and allocation facilities arerequired to be in full compliance with the requirements of this Order within6 months. Where the operator is in possession of a valid variance issuedby the authorized officer, the variance will take precedence over the Order,and will be effective on the date of its approval. The phase-in periodshall begin on the day this Order is published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> During the phase-in period, until the effective date of this Order, theBLM will continue to inspect and enforce all standards that have been usedin the past. The phase-in period is intended to allow time for the lessee/operatorto bring all existing equipment and operations, including specified proceduresand reporting practices, into full compliance by the effective date ofthis Order, and does not in any way relieve the lessee/operator from complyingwith the Orders of the authorized officer or being subject to the existinglaws, regulations, and practices by which the BLM has carried out the inspectionand enforcement policies in the past. The authorized officer may granttime extensions, on a case-by-case basis, where the operator can justifythe need for additional time or where the shut-in of production would becomenecessary. Abatement PeriodsSpecific comments were requested regarding the abatement period statedin the proposed rulemaking as ``prior to sales or removal'', asking whetherit would be preferable to set a specific time period or firm deadline.One comment recommended that specific deadlines should not be set. Anothercomment stated that many of the abatement periods are entirely too shortto provide adequate time to correct violations, and made specific recommendationsfor several standards recommending increases of 5 to 30 days for abatement.Specific deadlines were not added where the abatement period is ``priorto sales or removal,'' and clarification of the phrase is added to sectionIII.B.3. A number of abatement periods were lengthened as recommended inthe comments for specific violations where increases could be justified.Whenever the abatement period is stated as prior to sales or removal, thepotential for permanent loss of royalty exists and no oil or gas may passthe meter that has been designated as the measurement point.PurposeOne comment supported BLM's stated intent to provide regulations pertainingto the rights of the operator to administrative and/or judicial reviewand appeal. The regulations pertaining to the rights to administrativereview and hearing on the record, as well as the right to appeal, are containedin 43 CFR Subpart 3165, and language of assurance from that regulation,and a provision allowing extensions of abatement periods for any violationsunder certain conditions, have been added to the Order in this section.Another change to the Order included the addition of one phrase of clarificationin the first paragraph following the words ``measurement of oil'', whichreads ``and to provide standard operating practices for lease oil storageand handling facilities.''ScopeOne comment suggested that the description of the applicable lands subjectto this Order, in addition to all Federal and Indian (except Osage) oiland gas leases, be changed to the wording contained in 43 CFR 3161.1_Jurisdiction.The suggestion was adopted and the wording in section I-C, Scope, was changedto correspond with andSection; 3161.1. Another comment stated that the scopeis too broad, and that it was arbitrary for the Order to be applicableto State or privately-owned lands, when Federal and/or Indian leases areentitled to share the revenues, no matter how small, from non-jurisdictionalwells. The wording in 43 CFR 3161.1 as authorized by the Federal Oil andGas Royalty Management Act of 1982 will be maintained.DefinitionsSeveral comments offered specific language for amending the definitionsor suggested the addition of several more.The term ``authorized representative'' was removed to clarify the intentand ``authorized officer'' was added as recommended in several comments.A definition for ``business day'' was added and the term ``working day''was changed to ``business day'' throughout the Order.Several comments addressed the definition of ``by-pass'', offering varyinglanguage. All references to ``by-pass'' were removed from this Order. Thisterm is adequately covered in Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 3.One comment observed that most of the major violations listed will notresult in a substantial adverse impact on royalty income. All of the violationsidentified as ``major'' in the proposed Order were re-examined to determinetheir effect on royalty income, and several were changed to minor violations.Violations designated as major involve improperly designed and/or installedequipment incapable of correct measurement, or other circumstances thatdirectly and adversely affect Federal or Indian royalty calculations.One comment suggested the term ``minor violation'' needs clarificationbecause it could be construed to ripen ultimately into a major violation.This Order contains the definitions of major and minor violations usedin the regulations. They are viewed as separate offenses with separatepenalties. However, a minor violation remaining uncorrected for as littleas a few hours could indeed attain the status of a major violation andthe INC be reissued as major. The civil penalties for failure to complywith written orders to correct major and minor violation are containedin 43 CFR 3163.2(g)(2).One comment suggested the addition of definitions for ``operator'' and``operating rights owner''. These definitions were added in order to explainthe distinction between the terms. A few comments suggested revisions ofthe definition of ``oil'', and one comment recommended that ``bad oil'',``clean oil'', ``slop oil'', and ``waste oil'' be made subheadings of thedefinition of ``oil'' and arranged alphabetically. The suggestion was adoptedwith the exception of the term ``bad oil'' which was removed. The definitionof ``oil'' is considered adequate and is unchanged. The suggestion to add``allocation measurement'', ``facility'', ``purchasers'', and ``transporters''was not adopted.RequirementsOne comment suggested that the provision on recordkeeping in Order No.5 be added to this Order. To maintain consistency with the gas measurementorder, Onshore Order No. 5, in which the recordkeeping provision was removedfrom the minimum standards, and because recording and reporting are a proceduralrequirement of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act rather thanbeing an enforceable minimum standard, the requirement for recordkeepingwas inserted as a notification under section III.A. To accommodate thisinsertion, section III.A. General was changed to III.B. General. Also,the words ``and allocation'' were inserted in III.B.2. to clarify the intentof the Order.Numerous comments asked questions as to the intent of the Order in generalterms and as to how the Government would respond in certain situations,such as whether equipment failure would result in a violation citationfor an operator. In response to such questions, section III.B. of the Orderwas greatly expanded to provide this information.One comment suggested that, to maintain consistency with the gas measurementorder, a paragraph clarifying the failure to comply with the minimum standardsshould be added to III.B.2. This suggestion was adopted. In addition, astatement was also added to section III.B.2. saying that meters installedin accordance with standards in effect at the time of construction neednot automatically be retrofitted to meet revised API standards. The term``or latest revised standard'' has been removed from the standards. NewAPI standards will be reviewed before being adopted in rulemakings amendingthis Order. It would be improper to impose automatic tightening of standardswithout allowing the public an opportunity to comment during the rulemakingprocess. On the other hand, if API standards were relaxed, the Governmentshould review them carefully to make sure the public interest in accuratemeasurement is not harmed before amending the Order.Oil Measurement by Tank GaugingA suggestion in several comments to revise many of the references from``ASTM'' to ``ANSI/ASTM'' and insert ``Reaffirmed 1987'' was adopted throughoutthe Order.One comment suggested a clarification that temperature measurements arerequired to be made in the tank and not from the samples. The proposedsentence was added to paragraph l, sentence 4. Another suggestion was madeto add a reference to ANSI/ASTM D-1250 Tables 5A and 6A. The suggestionwas adopted in the final rulemaking. One comment suggested amendments to allow line sampling of the tank contentsduring delivery, measurement of API gravity and sediment and water contentat laboratories offlease, and volume and gravity corrections after liquidlevel measurements have been completed. Line sampling and volume and gravitycorrections may be appropriate in special cases but are generally not applicableto measurements onsite on the lease. Nothing in the Order precludes thedetermination of API gravity and sediment and water contents at laboratoriesoff the lease so long as the determinations are made prior to sale or removalof the oil from the lease. One comment suggested that sampling of the oilbe accomplished after gauging. This suggestion was not adopted becausegauging prior to sampling could cause a contaminated sample, resultingin incorrect measurements of oil quality. Standard No. 1_Sales Tank Equipment Two comments were made recommending the removal of API RP-12 Rl from theOrder because it is an API recommended practice. The recommended practiceof the API in this case is the primary reference industry-wide for setting,connecting, maintaining, and operating lease tanks, and therefore it hasbeen adopted as the only available and reasonable minimum standard. Onecomment stated that RP-12 Rl does not apply to large welded tanks usedin some custody transfers. RP-12 Rl relates directly to lease productionand is acceptable as a minimum standard. Several comments suggested that, given the complexity of many API standards,the proposed Order is too detailed. They suggested that a simple referenceto the API standards would be more appropriate rather than the inclusionof many specific and detailed standards. The complexity of the publishedstandards is recognized, but inclusion of the standards in detail is appropriatebecause each carries a specific violation, corrective action, and abatementperiod. However, there were many revisions made to clarify the wordingand a significant amount of consolidation of standards. The consolidationof separate standards into a single standard in some cases clarifies theintent and makes the Order easier to read. A few comments recommended that the abatement period for installation ofa proper pressure vacuum thief hatch and/or ventline valve be extendedfrom 5 days to 30 days to allow a more reasonable time period to do thework. This recommendation was adopted. One comment stated that the standardhas no direct bearing on the quality of measurement and should be removedor downgraded to a minor violation. This recommendation was not adopted.The absence of this equipment could adversely affect the quality of somegrades of oil and could, therefore, adversely affect the royalty paymentsdue the Federal Government. Where the quality of the oil could not be affected,as, for example, when the lighter constituents of the oil, which have lowervapor pressures, are absent, a variance could be requested. As suggested by a comment, the standard (III.C.1.b.) regarding tank connectionsand sealable valves was removed from this Order. This subject is adequatelycovered in Onshore Order No. 3. A number of comments addressed the requirement for a gauging referencepoint. Most stated that a reference point is not necessary unless ``outagegauging'' is being used. BLM agrees with the statements regarding outagegauging, but does not agree that the reference point is not necessary atall. The upper lip (seal point) of the thief hatch may be designated asthe reference point. The operator/lessee is responsible for setting thereference point, and the owner of the tank, if not the operator/lessee,should agree on the reference point. BLM will not be involved except toinspect for accuracy. The designation of such a reference point is requiredto be stenciled on the tank near the hatch. Standard No. 2_Sales Tank Calibrations A number of comments addressed the requirement for tank calibrations, mostof them suggesting reduction of the violation from major to minor and extensionof the abatement period to 60 days for the calibration of sales tanks.With regard to the first recommendation, the reduction of the gravity ofthe violation to minor is reasonable because losses may be recouped throughrecalculation of the measurement after recalibration of the tank. As forthe second recommendation, recalibration may require as much as 60 days.These recommendations have been adopted. One comment recommended a clarificationfor sales tank recalibration by replacing the word ``removed'' with thewords ``relocated or repaired''. This recommendation was adopted becauseit more fully covers the circumstances that require recalibration. Oneadditional reference, API RP 2556, was also inserted, based on comments.Several comments objected to the automatic submission of all tank calibrationtables to the authorized officer and recommended that they be submittedonly on request of the authorized officer. This recommendation was adoptedas a way of reducing unnecessary paperwork.Standard No. 3_Oil Sampling A number of comments were received on oil sampling. One comment recommendedminor changes to the API reference title and the addition of another referenceconcerned with automatic sampling. Both amendments further clarified thereference sources and were adopted. One comment suggested that samplingshould be done after gauging and another recommended that the violationbe changed from major to a minor. These recommendations were not adoptedfor reasons discussed above under Section C, Oil Measurement by Tank Gauging.Standard No. 4_Sales Tank Gauging A number of comments were received, some of which pertained to the typeand accuracy of the working tapes and the methods of certifying the accuracyof the tapes with respect to National Bureau of Standards (NBS) standards.A few comments offered the rationale that when checking a working tapeagainst a tape certified as accurate to NBS standards, NBS traceabilityis achieved. This rationale is acceptable and expresses fully the intentof the standard. Working tapes used in the field do not need to be individuallycertified, and proper measurement can be attained by using tapes whichare traceable to a certified tape and are warranted by the manufactureras accurate. One comment suggested the violation be changed to minor. Inaccuraciesintroduced by defective tapes may cause a loss of royalty to the governmentwhich cannot be recouped and the violation is therefore considered to bemajor. Standard No. 5_Oil Gravity Several comments were received, two concerning the API references. Changesand additions were adopted as recommended in order to incorporate a referenceto a field thermohydrometer test. Two comments stated that API is incorporatingASTM D-287 into the Chapter 9 series of test procedures. BLM will evaluatethe proposed thermohydrometer test when it is published, and if acceptable,may authorize its use. Some comments recommended that traceability of thefield instrument be established for comparison of the instrument with aninstrument certified to NBS standards. BLM agrees that working themohydrometersdo not need to be individually certified and that proper measurement canbe obtained by using a thermohydrometer which is checked against one certifiedto be accurate to NBS standards and warranted by the manufacturer as accurate.Several comments addressed the tolerances allowed in measuring the temperatureand gravity. The recommendations were evaluated and adopted as more practical,based on field experience. The word ``observed'' was inserted, so thatthe phrase reads ``the observed gravity'', and the measurements were changedto read to the nearest 1anddegrees; F for temperature and to the nearest0.1anddegrees; API gravity, principally because the gradations on the thermometersand other devices are marked in these intervals. Standard No. 6_Tank Temperature Numerous comments were received, four of which recommended that thermometeraccuracy could be attained by using the method of traceability. The recommendationswere adopted and applied in a manner similar to that applied to gaugingtapes and thermohydrometers. Five comments suggested that the Order providefor the use of portable electronic thermometers for static temperaturedeterminations. It is recognized that portable electronic thermometersmay be in use. This method will be evaluated and may be approved on a case-by-casebasis by the authorized officer. One comment stated that the API standard2543 requires one temperature measurement for tanks of 5,000 bbls or less.Nevertheless, for the sake of accuracy, BLM will continue to require thata temperature reading be taken on both opening and closing gauges. Onecomment suggested that the violation be made minor rather than major. Thesuggestion was not adopted because of potential adverse effects on themeasurement. Standard No. 7_Sediment and Water Several comments addressed the API reference, the complexities of the determinations,and stated that the standard was being revised. Some comments suggestedthat the entire section be removed from the Order. Following a review ofthe Order and API references, it was decided to maintain the standardswith only minor revisions, because they were substantially correct as written.One comment suggested that the Order be changed to allow the use of 100percent centrifuge tubes. The Order does not prohibit or restrict the useof 100 percent centrifuge tubes. A discussion on this tube was not includedbecause the amount of sediment and water can be read directly from thegraduations on the tube. As suggested in a comment, the temperature for heating samples prior tocentrifuging was changed to 140anddegrees; F. to reflect the new API standarddeveloped following publication of the proposed Order. D. Oil Measurement by Positive Displacement Metering System Several comments suggested changes in the wording of and additions to theAPI references. Most were adopted to clarify the objective of the standards.The term ``shut-in LACT'' was removed throughout this section because itmay not be necessary in all cases and the authorized officer may approveother courses of action. Standard No. D1_LACT Unit Components Several comments addressed additional components and recommended that theybe added to the Order. The components, automatic temperature/gravity compensator,and sediment and water monitor, were added, along with appropriate descriptions.The term ``shut-off valve'' was included in addition to ``diverter valve''because either may be used. Descriptions of the required operation of thecharging pump and motor, air eliminator, and diverter valve or shut-offvalve were added, because they were inadvertently left out of the proposedOrder. Two comments addressed by-pass piping. After a review of the standard,it was decided to remove it entirely from the measurement orders becauseit is adequately covered in Order No. 3. Some comments stated that accessibility of the LACT for inspection needsfurther clarification. In response, the word ``reasonable'' was insertedbefore the word ``inspection''. Inspections will be accomplished duringnormal working hours except in cases of unusual circumstances, which wouldrequire notification. Several comments were made regarding LACT failure and consequent notificationto the authorized officer. The wording of this standard was changed torequire notification of the authorized officer that an alternate methodof measurement was used. The gravity of the violation was changed frommajor to minor because no nonrecoupable loss would be likely to occur incase of a violation. A suggestion to change the abatement period to 30days was not adopted because 5 business days is sufficient and prompt notificationis needed for proper production accountability. Standard No. D2_Operating Requirements for LACT Unit Components SamplerSeveral comments were made regarding the positioning of the sample probe.The standard was taken from API Chapter 8.2 and is believed to be adequatewithout change. One comment suggested that the standard be modified to permit the use ofdensitometers and pycnometers for the measurement of gravity. BLM believesthe standards in the Order are sufficient as minimums. Composite Sample Container The standard and corrective action were changed in response to commentsto specify emptying the container after each sample withdrawal. One commentrecommended additional requirements for the sample container, such as aback pressure regulator and a vacuum breaker. These design features aredesirable, but not necessary for a minimum standard. Mixing System_Strainer A few comments were received suggesting minor rewording of this standard.The word ``noncorrosive'' was changed to ``corrosion resistant'' as recommendedbecause it is recognized that no material is truly non-corrosive. The suggestionto change the word ``testing'' to ``measurement'' regarding the propertiesof the sample was not adopted. ``Testing'' seems more appropriate for thisstandard. Positive Displacement Meter Two comments recommended changing the corrective action for a meter withouta nonresettable totalizer. An appropriate change was made to allow replacementof either the meter or the totalizer. One comment reiterated that it isin the interest of the operator that the meter perform correctly and, therefore,the violation should be changed to minor. The supposition that self-interestof the operator assures proper performance of the meter may not alwaysbe the case. Many times the operator has only limited control of the measurementdevice. Unrecorded oil sales or transfers have the potential for nonrecoupablelosses of royalties, and the recommendation was not adopted. Meter Proving Connections Several comments were submitted. One comment recommended that a clarificationbe made to the prover connection allowing for multiple valves. Other commentsrequested clarification of the positioning of the back pressure valve andcheck valve. By combining and rewording the standards, the needed clarificationwas made and the standard is now adequate and sufficient. Standard No. D.3_Sales Meter Proving Requirements One comment argued that the corrective action for proving a meter withan unacceptable prover does not require a shut-in of the LACT because volumeadjustments can be made to the previously measured volumes. The provisionhas been amended as suggested. The violation was changed to minor and theabatement period to 30 days, because no nonrecoupable loss of royalty wouldbe caused by a violation. Three comments requested clarification on the notification of the authorizedofficer when positive displacement meters are proved. The submission ofthe schedule of meter provings is required to permit the authorized officerto be present for the proving. Several comments were submitted stating that only the prover should beresponsible for the on-site possession of evidence that the meter proverhas been calibrated, and that if a master meter prover is utilized, evidencebe available on the site that said meter has been calibrated to the statedtolerances. The standard was amended to place the responsibility for therequired documentaton on the prover, who has custody of the equipment.However, the abatement period remains ``prior to proving''. It is assumed that any irregularities in calibration or proving of theLACT meter will be corrected during the calibration or proving of the meteras prescribed in the Order. Irregularities (failure properly to calibrateor prove the LACT meter) discovered after the proving shall be treatedas a violation. An incidence of noncompliance will be issued stating theappropriate corrective action and abatement period. Accordingly, the abatementperiods in this section of the Order are prior to completion of the calibrationor proving. Two comments were made objecting to the required frequency to prove metersupon initial installation or following repair and at least monthly thereafterfor the first three months. It is agreed that this requirement may be excessive.The standard has been modified appropriately and the abatement period changedto 10 business days. A few comments recommended changes to the requirement for bi-weekly LACTmeter provings whenever the throughput exceeds 100,000 bbl per month andrecommended that the provings be made monthly. Following a review of thestandard and its historical application in the field, it is agreed thatthe frequency should be monthly and the abatement period has been changedto l0th business day.Establishing the Operating Meter FactorSeveral comments objected to the tolerance 0.0005 in establishing a meterfactor and the level of major for violation of the standard. After dueconsideration, the standard is considered to be correct and the violationis appropriately classified as major. The rationale for this decision isthat improperly established meter factors can result in losses of royaltywhich cannot be recouped by recalculation. The addition of ``(0.05%)''was made for clarity, rather than a substitution as suggested in one comment.The corrective action was changed accordingly and the abatement periodwas changed to 10 business days.One comment addressed correction for the effect of pressure and temperatureon steel (Cps) and (Cts). The comment observed that these corrections applyonly to provers. In response to this comment the standard was changed.One comment stated that a properly determined meter factor could be accurate,but could have a value well outside the brackets of 0.9950 to 1.0050. Itis agreed that there is such a possibility, but the factor will be requiredto be within the specified bracket unless the deviation can be justifiedto the satisfaction of the authorized officer. The violation was changedfrom major to minor, because inaccurate measurements of this type can berecalculated following recalibration, and a corrected report submitted.The corrective action was clarified and abatement period modified.Standard No. D.4_Excessive Meter Factor DeviationTwo comments offered suggestions for the calculation of volumetric correctionswhen excessive meter factor deviation is discovered. One comment observedthat current industry practice provides for correction of the error forone-half of the period between current and previous tests. A second commentrecommended the Order be made consistent with Minerals Management Service(MMS), 30 CFR Parts 250 and 256, which state the procedures for dealingwith meter malfunctions. Following a review of MMS regulations, it wasdecided to adopt this recommendation. This change in the Order does notin any way relieve the operator/lessee of the responsibility of notifyingthe authorized officer of meter malfunction or meter failure.Several comments discussed the standard requiring that a meter factor shallnot exceed l percent above or below unity. One comment suggested increasingthe allowable deviation to 2 percent while another comment recommendedthe removal of the standard in its entirety. The added explanation underExcessive Meter Factor Deviation (III-D-4) is adequate to answer thesecomments and offers a definite method for recalculation of volumes whenexcessive meter factor deviation or meter factor malfunction occurs. Theviolation has been changed from major to minor because recalibration willenable the meter factor to be recalculated.Standard No. D.5_Meter Reporting RequirementsTwo comments addressed the forms set out in API Chapter 12 for filing meterproving reports. One comment observed that these forms are only examplesand are not intended to be used as a standard form. Another comment recommendedan addition to the standard to allow the use of the forms in API Chapter12 or any similar formats provided all the data are included. It is agreedthat the intent of the standard is properly served so long as the reportis filed in a timely manner and includes all the data as prescribed onthe forms specified by API. Several comments recommended the extensionof time for abatement ranging from 15 to 30 days. This recommendation wasnot deemed appropriate and was not adopted. Proving reports should be availableto the operator at the time of proving and the 10 business days is consideredreasonable.E. Oil Measurement by Other Methods or at Other Locations Acceptable tothe Authorized OfficerStandard No. E.1_Measurement on Lease, Unit or CommunitizedAreaOne comment objected to the violation being classified as major and anotherrecommended approval of turbine meters for use, and any other method approvedby API, without first obtaining approval from the authorized officer. Inanswer to the first comment, the violation is considered major becausethere is the potential for immediate and adverse impact on royalty collectionand nonrecoupable loss due to possible improper or inaccurate measurement.In answer to the latter comment, 43 CFR 3162.7-2, Measurement of Oil, specificallyrestricts the measurement of oil, without prior approval, to tank gaugingand positive displacement metering systems.Standard No. E.2_Measurement at a Location Off the Lease, Unit, Unit ParticipatingArea, or Communitized AreaSeveral comments addressed off-lease measurement. One comment agreed thatprior approval is in order, but emphasized that such approval should notbe unreasonably delayed, and stated that the violation should not be classifiedas major. An application for off-lease measurement is not automaticallyapproved. The necessary data is required to be submitted for study anda justification for such an action is required to be made to the authorizedofficer. If the application is complete and proper justification is provided,the BLM will make a timely decision. The violation is major because thereis potential for improper measurement or allocation and adverse impactson royalty payments that may not be recoupable. Another comment objectedto the necessity for obtaining prior approval for existing off-lease measurement.The phase-in period of 6 months is considered sufficient time to obtainneeded approvals; however, existing off-lease measurement should have beenapproved by the authorized officer even without the advent of this Order.For consistency, the abatement period was changed to 20 days.F. Determination of Oil Volumes by Methods Other Than MeasurementOne comment observed that the cost of recording and reporting would exceedthe income from the oil. Recording and reporting are required by the FederalOil and Gas Royalty Management Act. Several other comments agreed withthe need for the standards. One comment suggested clarifying the intentby inserting the words ``or disposed of'' following the words ``may beclassified''. This suggestion was adopted because it recognizes a possiblealternative disposition of waste oil.Concerning slop oil, in response to comments, the standard was rewrittento require only that the authorized officer be notified of the volume soldor disposed of and the method of computation of the volume for proper productaccountability. IV. Variances from Minimum Standards Two comments recommended that both oral requests and approvals be allowedso long as the oral request was followed by a written request not laterthan the fifth business day following oral approval. This recommendationis acceptable and is adopted. In addition, the standard was expanded toinclude language allowing authorized officers to issue Notice to Lessees(NTLs) on their own motion and establish modified standards or variancesfor specific areas of operation. A provision for the authorized officerto protect royalty income and provide for proper product verification byrequiring additional standards was also included to provide administrativeflexibility. While situations requiring additional standards should beinfrequent, it must be remembered that the Order consists of minimum standards,not necessarily optimum standards applicable to every situation on a nationwidebasis. When additional standards are required, the operator/lessee willbe notified in writing, the additional requirements will be reasonable,and the rationale for imposing the standards will be fully explained. The principal authors of this final rulemaking are Richard T. Hunter, Lakewood,Colorado; Joe Delozier, Bakersfield, California; Terry Messerli, Billings,Montana; Upendra Parikh, Jackson, Mississippi; and Joe Chesser, Santa Fe,New Mexico, of the Bureau of Land Management Orders Committee responsiblefor the development and issuance of this Order, assisted by the OrdersTask Group, the staff of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management,Bureau of Land Management, the Office of the Solicitor, Department of theInterior, and Raymond W. Vinyard, retired from the Bureau of Land Management.Ronald Heath, Minerals Management Service, was also a part of the OrdersCommittee and assisted on royalty accounting issues. It is hereby determined that this final rulemaking does not constitutea major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C)of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C))is required. The final Order will have no adverse economic effects, because its requirementsreflect the operating practices currently followed by prudent operatorswhen oil production is measured in accordance with the standards and practicesrecommended by the American Petroleum Institute. The final Order may providea beneficial economic effect. Industry is less likely to be subjected toassessments or penalties resulting from violations and/or the requirementto undertake costly remedial actions, if it has a better understandingof the requirements of the Bureau of Land Management that relate to themeasurement of oil production. The State Governments that share in theroyalties collected and Indian mineral owners will also benefit from assuranceof more accurate oil measurement. The minimum standards established bythis Order essentially are those that have been required but not officiallypromulgated by this Department and impose the same burden on all lesseesand operators, regardless of the size of the entity, on lands where themeasurement of oil production is under the jurisdiction of the Bureau ofLand Management. Therefore, the Department of the Interior has determinedthat this document is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291 andwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>The Order does not affect current information collection and recordkeepingrequirements.

Introduction<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Authority</ITAG>This Order is established pursuant to the authority granted to the Secretaryof the Interior under various Federal and Indian mineral leasing statutesand the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982. This authorityhas been delegated to the Bureau of Land Management and is implementedby the onshore oil and gas operations regulations contained in Title 43CFR Part 3160. Section 3164.1 specifically authorizes the Director, Bureauof Land Management, to issue Onshore Oil and Gas Orders when necessaryto implement or supplement the operating regulations, and provides thatall such Orders shall be binding on the lessees and operators of Federaland restricted Indian oil and gas leases which have been, or may hereafterbe, issued. Specific authority for the provisions contained in this Order is foundat andSection;3162.7-1, <T3>Disposition of Production</T3>; andSection;3162.7-2, <T3>Measurement of Oil</T3>; and Subpart 3163, <T3>Noncompliance and Assessment</T3>.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Purpose</ITAG>One purpose of this Order is to establish requirements and minimum standardsfor the measurement of oil, and to provide standard operating practicesfor lease oil storage and handling facilities, by the methods authorizedin 43 CFR 3162.7-2, i.e., measurement by tank gauging, positive displacementmetering system, or other methods acceptable to the authorized officer.Proper oil measurement ensures that the Federal Government and Indian mineralowners receive the royalties due, as specified in the governing oil andgas leases. Another purpose of this Order is to establish abatement periods for correctiveaction when noncompliance with the minimum standards is detected. ThisOrder also serves as notice to any party cited for noncompliance that itmay request from the authorized officer an extension of the abatement periodfor any violation, provided that the request for extension is applied forand granted prior to the expiration of the abatement period previouslyallowed.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Scope</ITAG>This Order is applicable to all Federal and Indian (except Osage) oil andgas leases. In addition, this Order is also applicable to all wells andfacilities on State or privately owned mineral lands committed to a unitor communitization agreement that affects Federal or Indian interests,notwithstanding any provision of a unit or communitization agreement tothe contrary.II.

K. Minor violation means noncompliance which does not rise to the levelof a ``major violation'' (43 CFR 3160.0-5). L. Operating rights owner means a person or entity holding operating rightsin a lease issued by the United States. A lessee also may be an operatingrights owner if the operating rights in a lease or portion thereof havenot been severed from record title (43 CFR 3160.0-5). M. Operator means any person or entity, including but not limited to thelessee or operating rights owner, who has stated in writing to the authorizedofficer that it is responsible under the terms and conditions of the leasefor the operations conducted on the leased lands or portions thereof (43CFR 3160.0-5).

III. Requirements <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Required Recordkeeping </ITAG>The operator shall keep all test data, meter reports, charts/recordings,or other similar records for 6 years from the date they were generated,or if involved in an audit or investigation, the records shall be maintaineduntil the record holder is released by the Secretary from the obligationto maintain them. The authorized officer may request these records anytime within this period. Records submitted shall include all additionalinformation used to compute volumes so that computations may be verified.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. General (See 43 CFR 3162.7-2) </ITAG>1. The regulations at 43 CFR 3162.7-2 authorize oil measurement methodsfor production from leases, units, and communitization agreements subjectto the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management, as such jurisdictionis defined in 43 CFR 3161.1. The authorized oil measurement methods aretank gauging, positive displacement metering systems, and other methodsacceptable to the authorized officer. The requirements and minimum standardsfor each of these methods are set forth below. 2. These requirements and minimum standards are based on the standardsand practices recommended by the American Petroleum Institute (API). TheAPI standards and recommended practices are considered by both the Departmentof the Interior and the oil and gas industry to be appropriate for properoil measurement. The requirements and minimum standards set out hereinare those necessary to promote conservation of natural resources and toensure that oil production, except for waste oil, is properly measuredfor sales and allocation purposes, in order that the Federal Governmentand Indian mineral owners will receive the royalties due under governingoil and gas leases. When an infraction of the minimum standards in thisOrder is discovered it will be considered noncompliance and an incidentof noncompliance (INC) will be issued. Operators who discover noncompliancewith these minimum standards and take immediate corrective action willnot be issued an INC. If the authorized officer or his representative ispresent when an operator discovers a malfunction or does not use correctprocedures as specified in this Order, an INC will be issued unless immediatecorrective action is taken. A major violation as defined in this Order will generally require an immediateshut-in of the metering device. However, where the non-recoupable lossis not significant or where damage to the resource is likely to occur ifa shut-in is required, an abatement period of 24 hours may be given. The intent of these minimum standards is to ensure that when equipmentmalfunctions that could result in inaccurate measurement occur, that propercorrective actions are taken, the authorized officer is notified, and anamended production report is submitted. Equipment failure that is discovered by the operator and promptly correctedwill not be considered a violation. However, the incidents of noncompliancethat may result from equipment failure are considered violations, and apartial list is as follows: Failure to install equipment properly. Failure to repair or correct equipment malfunction properly or in a timelymanner. Failure to submit report of alternate method of measurement for sales.Failure to submit amended production reports in a timely manner. Failure to adhere to the minimum standard procedures specified in thisOrder. The use of improper equipment, when discovered, will be considered a violation,and an INC will be issued. The use of improper procedures will be considered a violation and, whenwitnessed by the authorized officer or his representative, immediate correctiveaction will be required. In the event that proper procedures are then usedas required by this Order, and prior to completing the operation, calibration,or proving, the violation will be considered as properly corrected. Inthis case, although the violation will be documented in the agency files,no formal INC will be issued. All future sales and allocation facilities and sales or allocation facilitiesin existence on the effective date of this Order, unless covered by a validvariance, shall meet the minimum standards prescribed in this Order. Meter installations constructed in accordance with the API standards ineffect at that time shall not automatically be required to retrofit tomeet revised API standards. The Bureau will review any revised API standards,and when deemed necessary will amend the Order accordingly through therulemaking process. Any variances from these requirements and minimum standards shall be inaccordance with section IV of this Order. 3. A violation of a minimum standard established by this Order shall beabated within the time period specified.   Where abatement is required ``prior to sales or removal'', this means thatnecessary actions shall be taken so that no oil may be removed beyond themeasurement point until properly measured.   If any such violation is not abated within the required period, actionshall be initiated in accordance with 43 CFR Subpart 3163.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Oil Measurement by Tank Gauging   </ITAG>Oil measurement by tank gauging shall accurately compute the volume ofoil withdrawn from a properly calibrated sales tank by measuring the heightof the oil level in the tank before delivery (opening gauge) and then measuringthe height of the oil level in the tank after delivery (closing gauge).The opening and closing gauges are then used with the tank calibrationcharts (tank tables) to compute accurately the volume of oil withdrawn.Gauging may be accomplished by measuring the height of the oil level fromthe tank bottom or a fixed datum plate upward to the surface of the oilin the tank (innage gauging) or by measuring from a fixed reference pointat the top of the tank downward to the surface of the oil in the tank (outagegauging). Samples shall be taken from the oil before gauging to determineAPI oil gravity and sediment and water content. Prior to gauging, the temperatureof the oil shall be determined from measurements made in the tank. Themeasured oil volume shall then be corrected for sediment and water content,and to the standard sales temperature of 60anddegrees; F.   The following requirements and minimum standards shall be accomplishedin accordance with API Standard 2545 (ANSI/ASTM D 1085) ``Method of GaugingPetroleum and Petroleum Products,'' 1985, reaffirmed in 1987, and (ANSI/ASTMD-1250), Tables 5A and 6A.   1. <T3>Sales Tank Equipment.</T3> Each oil storage tank to be used for oilsales by tank gauging shall be properly equipped for such gauging, usingthe ``API Recommended Practice for Setting, Connecting, Maintenance, andOperation of Lease Tanks, API RP 12 R1,'' 1986.
