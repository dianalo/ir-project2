Sweep Nets 400 Arrests</HEAD><BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   One thousand officers from the Florida Panhandle to the Keysarrested 2,000 people on charges of using or dealing crack, andpolice in Los Angeles arrested more than 400 people in anti-gangsweeps.   Many of the Florida suspects were nabbed by undercover officersposing as dealers, while others were captured in raids and dramaticfoot chases.   Many also were back on the street within hours.   After the 48-hour roundup ended early Sunday, officers counted2,076 arrests. In addition to the arrests, they seized 3,500 rocksof crack cocaine, 327 vehicles, more than $55,000 in cash, nearly 10pounds of powdered cocaine and 50 firearms.   ``It's gone way above our expectations,'' said Broward CountySheriff Nick Navarro, who organized ``Operation Rock Pile,''believed to be the largest coordinated effort against street-leveldrug users and dealers.   At some places Saturday night, authorities were taking insuspects at the rate of 100 an hour, with more than a third of thearrests in south Florida.   The Florida Sheriffs Association plans to meet later this monthto plan more large drug sweeps, said Al Gordon, Broward Sheriff'sspokesman.   ``Look how much crack we took in. It shows these type ofoperations work. You can expect more,'' Gordon said.   Gang members were the targets of the police sweeps in LosAngeles, part of a continuing ``Operation Hammer,'' which began lastsummer. Of the 412 people arrested, authorities said 221 were gangmembers.   But a religious leader said a bill that was enacted last year andallows police to designate particular gangs as criminal doesn't gofar enough. The Rev. Carl Washington urged state lawmakers to revisethe bill so that anyone can be charged for belonging to a gang.   ``There's no such thing as a gang for social gathering,''Washington said Sunday evening.   Gangs were believed to be the cause of violence that eruptedSaturday during a six-hour soul concert at the Los Angeles MemorialColiseum. Nearly 250 officers assigned to the sweeps were divertedto the arena when warring gangs stabbed three people and fired shotsat others, said Detective Tony Celli.   Details of the disturbance were unavailable from police, althougha Los Angeles Times review of the concert said hundreds of skittishpeople ran for exits as fights broke out on the field.   The Florida crackdown involved 67 sheriff's offices and severalpolice departments.   ``I am delighted with it,'' said Volusia County Sheriff BobVogel. ``We're attacking both ends _ supply and demand.''   Vogel, who has gained notoriety for seizing suspected drug moneyfrom interstate motorists near Daytona Beach, said the statewideeffort will be repeated until street-level buyers and sellers getthis message: ``If you sell crack cocaine or purchase crack cocaine,you're going to jail.''   Many of the suspects were charged with either cocaine possessionor dealing, and used bail bondsmen to post their $5,000 to $10,000bond.   Authorities targeted high-crime urban areas, but were surprisedby the more than 400 arrests in the mostly rural Panhandle.   ``It shows that crack is not just an urban problem,'' said Gordon.   The tactics used in the sweep _ particularly undercover stings _raised concern with some civil rights groups.   ``Anytime you have reverse stings with police used as a lure fordrug users you're entering a very sensitive area,'' said CharleenCarres, legislative counsel for the Florida chapter of the AmericanCivil Liberties Union in Tallahassee.   ``The ACLU is in favor of battling drugs, but we don't feelpeoples' rights should be violated in the rush to stop drugtraffic.''</TEXT></DOC>
