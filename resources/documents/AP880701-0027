On Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee tucked an amendmentinto the drug bill that would require prospective purchasers ofhandguns to wait seven days before taking possession, to allow forbackground checks.   ``We will be incapable of making substantial headway in our waragainst drug trafficking unless we are also prepared to disarm drugdealers and drug traffickers and drug users,'' said Rep. EdwardFeighan, D-Ohio, who offered the waiting-period amendment.   The proposal withstood a challenge from Rep. Bill McCollum,R-Fla., who attempted to substitute an amendment requiring that asystem be developed to identify felons who attempt to buy firearms.The McCollum substitute was defeated 22-12, and the waiting periodwas then approved by a voice vote.   Feighan noted that Republicans on the committee did not ask fora recorded vote, and said that is an indication that most membersdo not want to be publicly reported as opposing ``such a sensiblegun-control measure.''   ``The NRA is losing credibility in this institution andnationally because they have opposed the most reasonable efforts atgun control,'' said Feighan. ``Their insanity doesn't end.''   The NRA contends that waiting periods don't work.   ``We think that law-abiding citizens will be the only onesaffected and criminals will continue to evade the law,'' Baker said.   During the waiting period, law enforcement agencies could try todetermine whether a prospective buyer has a criminal record or arecord of mental incompetency.   The measure would exempt those who present dealers withcertificates from police stating that the purchasers' lives havebeen threatened.   Twenty-two states have some form of waiting periods, withCalifornia having the longest at 15 days. The amendment wouldsupersede less stringent state waiting-period laws, but leavestronger laws standing.</TEXT></DOC>
