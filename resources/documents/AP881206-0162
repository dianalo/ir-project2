Gorbachev arrived todayfor meetings with President Reagan and U.N. leaders, pledging to dohis part toward easing tensions in ``a world that is going throughsome very crucial changes.''   Gorbachev is expected to put a moderate face on Soviet foreignpolicy and show himself eager to achieve progress with the new U.S.administration. He was expected to offer wide-ranging proposals onarms control and other issues, including cuts in Warsaw Pact forces,sources said.   The plane carrying Gorbachev, his wife, Raisa, and three topSoviet foreign policy advisers touched down at John F. KennedyInternational Airport shortly before 3 p.m.   Gorbachev, dressed in gray overcoat and hat, exited the Aeroflotplane with his wife after the 10-hour flight and walked down to thetarmac, where they were welcomed by Aly I. Teymour, the UnitedNations' chief of protocol. Also on hand was U.S. Chief of ProtocolSelwa Roosevelt.   Addressing the crowd, Gorbachev said: ``We are living in a worldthat is going through some very crucial changes and we all, allnations, have their own concerns and interests. We shall be sharingour concerns and interests in thinking over the current situation.''   ``I believe that we can safely say even now that theconversations and the meeting itself will doubtless promote greaterdynamism in the dialogue and relations between our two countries,''he added.   The Soviet leader said he expected to meet with American businessleaders and officials of other countries and that he hoped thesewill be ``useful and fruitful days. We are certainly prepared tomake our contribution toward that end.''   Gorbachev spoke in Russian, with the English translation read byViktor Sukhudreyev, a Soviet Foreign Ministry official who hastranslated at U.S.-Soviet summits for two decades.   Gorbachev was accompanied to New York by Foreign Minister EduardA. Shevardnadze and Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, and byDeputy Premier Vladimir Kamentsev, according to the official Tassnews agency. Yuri Dubinin, the Soviet Ambassador to Washington andhis predecessor, Anatoly Dobrynin, who is now a foreign policyadviser to Gorbachev, also were on hand at the airport.   There was advance word that the Soviet leader may offer newproposals to ease superpower tensions, strengthen the United Nationsand improve the world's environment.   A U.S. official acknowledged the possibility of a ``grandgesture,'' such as a reduction of Soviet troops in Czechoslovakiaand Hungary. ``It is plausible they would do it on the eve of theopening of negotiations with the West and also as a public relationsmove,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The official told The Associated Press that the Soviets gave noformal notification in advance of Gorbachev's visit of a troopreduction. ``However,'' the official said, ``it is certainly on ourlist of expectations.''   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact areexpected to open talks on reducing troops, tanks and othernon-nuclear forces early next year.   A motorcade of some 45 limousines, including Soviet diplomats,U.N. officials and security officers, headed for Manhattan, givingthe city the first taste of the traffic tie-ups expected during theGorbachevs' three-day stay. It was the first visit by a Sovietleader to New York since Nikita Khrushchev's 1960 trip.   The Gorbachevs are staying at the Soviet Mission to the U.N., a16-mile trip from the airport.   On Wednesday, the Soviet leader addresses the United Nations andmeets with Reagan and President-elect George Bush. After a day ofsightseeing in Manhattan, he travels to Cuba and Great Britain.   In a dispatch by a diplomatic correspondent distributed shortlyafter Gorbachev's departure, Tass said Gorbachev intends to discussthe entire range of U.S.-Soviet issues with Reagan and Bush.   ``The Soviet leadership intends to talk about importantsubstantive matters concerning real political cooperation betweenthe two countries on the broadest range of problems, including thestate of affairs and prospects for further headway in the fields ofarms limitation and reduction, human rights, a settlement ofregional conflicts, and the development of bilateral relations,''   It said Gorbachev's decision to address the United Nations was asign of Soviet regard for the world body as an ``indispensablemechanism in the quest for a peaceful solution to internationalissues, for resolution of crisis situations, and for settlement ofother global problems.''   In several reports Monday, official media emphasized the newstyle of Soviet diplomacy and the need for speedy progress on armscontrol issues when Bush takes office in January.   In a front-page report from New York, the government newspaperIzvestia pointedly told its readers that Gorbachev's behavior at theU.N. will differ markedly from Khrushchev's shoe-thumping in 1960.   Izvestia, without naming Khrushchev, recalled ``how our leaderlooked then in the hall of the General Assembly, how he jumped upfrom place, trying to interrupt speakers he didn't like, pounded hisfist on the table (and not only his fist).''   But it was the need for more progress on arms control that Tassstressed. It sounded an optimistic note, saying four summits betweenGorbachev and Reagan leading to a treaty signed a year agoeliminating medium and shorter-range nuclear missiles had built a``strong and solid'' foundation for U.S.-Soviet relations.   It said there certainly would be future problems, but expressedconfidence the two sides could work through them.   ``It is perfectly natural that the new administration will needsome time to get its bearings in the complexity of domestic andinternational problems. But it is very important not to drag outthis period. Marking time in international affairs, especially inthe domain of arms limitation and reduction, is tantamount not onlyto loss of time, but to backsliding,'' Tass said.   New York police said the Gorbachevs would visit the ObservationDeck of the World Trade Center on Wednesday and drive past the StockExchange and through the Broadway area. Opening a Soviet exportshow, viewing European paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Artand visiting Central Park were on the schedule Thursday.   Police said Mrs. Gorbachev might also visit a department storeWednesday.   During his trip, the Soviet leader will try to end Soviet Union's``enemy image'' because the Kremlin needs to divert resources fromthe military and foreign aid to solve stubborn internal problems,Soviet sources in Moscow said.   Gorbachev will also try to persuade Fidel Castro in Cuba, thecostly Soviet client where he is to arrive Friday, that it is timeto de-emphasize his penchant for revolutions, the sources said.   Western diplomats in Moscow say the Soviet Union does not havethe resources to continue spending at its current rate on its ownmilitary and on aid to client countries such as Cuba.   Gorbachev has said he wants to lessen East-West tension to divertsome resources from the military to improving food, clothing andconsumer goods for Soviet citizens.</TEXT></DOC>
