This Part was published as an interim rule (effectiveMarch 30, 1989) on February 28, 1989, in 54 FR 8512.Subpart A: Certifications and DeterminationsThis Subpart establishes policies and procedures for submission by a commercialnuclear power plant licensee of a certification for Federal assistanceunder Executive Order 12657. It contains policies and procedures for FEMA'sdeterminations, with respect to a certification. It establishes a frameworkfor providing Federal assistance to licensees. It also provides proceduresfor review and evaluation of the adequacy of licensee offsite radiologicalemergency planning and preparedness.Subpart B: Federal ParticipationThis Subpart establishes policies and procedures for providing Federalassistance for offsite radiological emergency planning and preparednessin a situation when such assistance under E.O. 12657 has been requested.It describes the process for providing Federal facilities and resourcesto a nuclear power plant licensee after an affirmative determination onthe licensee certification under Subpart A. It describes response functionswhich Federal agencies might provide and the process for allocating responsibilitiesamong Federal agencies through the Federal Radiological Preparedness CoordinatingCommittee (FRPCC) and Regional Assistance Committees (RACs).An integrated approach to the development of offsite radiological emergencyplanning, preparedness, and response involving licensees and State andlocal governments, voluntary organizations, and the Federal Governmentis the approach most likely to provide the best protection to the public.To carry out the foregoing, FEMA is engaged in a cooperative effort withlicensees and State and local governments and other Federal agencies inthe development of State and local plans and preparedness to cope withradiological emergencies at commercial nuclear power facilities. Theseactivities are described in 44 CFR Part 350, ``Review and Approval of Stateand Local Radiological Emergency Plans and Preparedness,'' and Part 351,``Radiological Emergency Planning and Preparedness,'' which sets out Federalagency roles and assigns tasks for assisting State and local governments.In the event of an actual radiological emergency, the Federal RadiologicalEmergency Response Plan (FRERP) provides for the overall Federal supportto State and local governments for all types of peacetime radiologicalincidents including those occurring at nuclear power plants. The FRERPwas published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 8, 1985, (50 FR Part 46542).Executive Order 12657 was issued to ensure that adequate offsite radiologicalemergency planning and pareparedness is in place at commercial nuclearpower plants to satisfy the emergency planning requirements of the NuclearRegulatory Commission (NRC) for the issuance and retention of operatinglicenses. The Order applies to those situations where State and local governments,either individually or together, decline or fail to prepare commercialnuclear power plant offsite radiological emergency preparedness plans thatare sufficient to satisfy the NRC licensing requirements or to participateadequately in the preparation, demonstration, testing, exercise, or useof such plans.This regulation supports the amendments made to NRC's rule, 10 CFR 50.47(c)(1)and 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F., effective December 13, 1987,(52 FR 42078) for those situations where State and local governments declineor fail to participate in radiological emergency planning and preparedness.In connection with nuclear power plant licensing, FEMA has previously enteredinto a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on planning and preparedness (50FR 15485, April 18, 1985) with the NRC, under which FEMA will furnish assessments,findings, and determinations as to whether offsite emergency plans andpreparedness are adequate and continue to be capable of implementation(e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffinglevels and qualification, and equipment adequacy). These assessments, findings,and determinations will be used by the NRC in connection with its own licensingand regulatory responsibilities. FEMA will support these assessments, findings,and determinations in the NRC licensing process and related administrativeand court proceedings (See 10 CFR Part 50).The Executive Order makes provision for FEMA, to the extent permitted bylaw, to obtain full reimbursement either jointly or severally for servicesperformed by FEMA or other Federal agencies pursuant to E.O. 12657 fromany affected licensee and from any affected nonparticipating or inadequatelyparticipating State and local government. The policy and procedures forthe reimbursement process will be covered in separate regulations publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments on Interim Rule</ITAG>As no proposed rule was published, FEMA requested that comments on theinterim rule be submitted by May 1, 1989, with an indication that thesecomments would be reviewed and, as appropriate, amendments made.Twenty-six written communications were received and have been placed inthe Docket. Of these, 6 were from utility companies; 5 were from interestgroups (e.g., citizen groups, environmental groups, and utility associations);10 were from State governments, 2 were from local governments, 2 from Federalagencies, and 1 from a member of Congress. Eight supported the rule, 12opposed issuance of the rule, and 6 commented on specific matters, someunfavorably, without indicating one way or the other an overall positionon issuance of the rule.A number of the comments were general in nature. These considered the basicvalidity or authority for promulgation of the regulation or at least apart thereof, and certain of the premises underlying the regulation suchas the realism assumption and related issues, Federalism and ``conflictof interest.'' There were also a number of comments directed to specificsections of the regulation. These specific comments will be related tothe applicable section, discussed, and the Agency's response to the commentsnoted with supporting rationales.As a general principle underlying FEMA's response to the comments on thisregulation, it must be understood that FEMA is an independent establishmentwithin the Executive Branch of the Government and, as such, is subjectto the direction, control, and policy decisions of the President. FEMA'sfunctions under this regulation derive from authority (Federal Civil DefenseAct of 1950, as amended, and Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act)which is vested in the President and delegated by him to the Director ofFEMA.A. General Comments<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Role of FEMA in the Planning Process</ITAG>Several commenters, some opposing and some supporting the interim rule,expressed concerns that the rule might be applied in ways that would disruptthe status quo, i.e., under Part 350 and NRC regulations, States are ableto compensate for nonparticipation of local governments and utilities areable to submit offsite plans for FEMA review. Supporters of the interimrule were concerned that the rule might be applied in a way that wouldhinder a licensee's own effort to develop an adequate offsite emergencyplan, such as at the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant which was recently licensedby NRC under existing NRC and FEMA procedures. Critics suggested that FEMAmight find existing State or local participation in offsite planning ``inadequate''under the new rule without sufficient basis, thus subverting and replacingthe existing 350 process. There was general concern on the part of commentersthat the new rule which covers inadequacy might affect every nuclear powerplant and foster the assumption that FEMA would take over all offsite planning,preparedness, and response functions.Both existing FEMA and NRC regulations and the new rule apply to situationswhere State or local governments ``decline or fail'' to participate inpreparing offsite emergency plans. In some cases, the States have compensatedfor the lack of participation by local governments and these plans havebeen reviewed by FEMA under 44 CFR Part 350 and found to be adequate. Intwo cases, those of Shoreham and Seabrook Nuclear Power Plants, the utilitieshave compensated for the lack of participation of State and local governmentsby preparing their own offsite plans, with some technical assistance fromFEMA, and submitting them through the NRC to FEMA for review. Both planshave been reviewed by FEMA under 44 CFR Part 350 and the NRC-FEMA MOU onplanning and preparedness and were found to be adequate. Thus, the newrule will have no adverse effect upon these findings of adequacy. Section352.2(c) explicitly provides that the regulation in this part does notaffect the validity of emergency preparedness developed by licensees independentof or prior to Executive Order 12657.It is important to emphasize that FEMA continues to urge State and localgovernments to cooperate with NRC licensees in the development and implementationof offsite emergency plans. Similarly, the NRC continues to require itslicensees to seek the cooperation of State and local governments to developand implement these offsite plans. Both agencies have stated in many forumsthat they view State and local participation in the development and implementationof offsite emergency planning as the preferred approach.Under the new rule, NRC licensees have another option when State or localgovernments decline or fail to participate in emergency planning. The newrule provides for FEMA technical assistance in the development of utilityprepared offsite plans and for the utility plan to be supplemented withprovisions for Federal facilities and resources under certain exceptionalcircumstances.Under the new rule, the threshold for provision of Federal technical assistancein the development of offsite plans is a FEMA determination (under andSection;352.5(f)) after consultation with State and responsible local officials,that a ``decline or fail'' situation exists. Given FEMA's policy and beliefthat State and local participation in offsite planning is the preferredapproach, this is a significant threshold. This threshold for the provisionof Federal facilities and resources is a FEMA determination (under andSection;252.6(b)) that the licensee has made maximum feasible use of its own resourcesand it assumes that the State and local authorities would contribute theirfull resources under realism assumptions discussed in Section 4 hereafter.If the offsite plans are still deficient, the plans can be augmented withFederal technical assistance, facilities, and resources.Finally, FEMA views the development of a utility offsite plan, under eitherexisting regulations or the new rule, as a last resort that NRC licenseescan use in their attempt to demonstrate under NRC's regulations that thereis reasonable assurance that adequate protective measures can and willbe taken in the event of an emergency.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Command and Control and Federalism Issues</ITAG>A number of commenters, primarily those opposed to issuance of the ruleitself, commented on these matters. These commenters also opposed issuanceof Executive Order 12657 and challenged it for much the same reasons theychallenged the rule. At least one commenter who supported the rule repliedto these critics of the rule.The issues raised are primarily Federalism and command and control. Theformer encompasses States rights and the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.It also involves Sec. 5(c) and (d), of the Executive Order and andSection;352.27 of the rule which states that FEMA shall provide for initial Federalresponse activities including command and control of the off site responseas may be needed. The challenge to statutory authority is basically ofthis function. The authority for most of the functions under the rule wasnot challenged.The Federalism/States rights issue is, in effect, an argument over whetherState and local governments rather than the Federal Government have theright to determine that a particular site for a nuclear power plant isunsafe, that workable emergency plans are impossible, and that the FederalGovernment should defer to State and local governments on this point. Itis argued that the rule is in violation of Executive Order 10612 on Federalism_thatin applying that Executive Order site selection is a purely local matterand the Federal Government should defer to States and localities.These comments ignore the consideration that in the area of nuclear powerplant radiological health and safety matters, the Atomic Energy Act haspreempted the field and that site selection is a Federal matter. In connectionwith the issuance of the interim rule FEMA prepared a Federalism assessmentwhich certified that there was nothing in the regulation inconsistent withthe principles, criteria and requirements stated in Executive Order 10612and the regulation did not affect the States' ability to discharge traditionalState governmental functions or other aspects of State sovereignty.With respect to command and control, commenters shared a concern expressedin one comment that virtually the entire Federal Government apparatus isempowered to respond to a nuclear emergency at the behest of FEMA assuming``command and control'' authorities without the State and local officialsand even apparently over their objections. A commenter challenged the statutoryauthority for this function.These comments focus on only a very limited segment of Federal functionunder the Order and rule, do not give proper cognizance to the realismassumption, and fail to recognize the built in protections in the ruleitself.For most functions which would be performed under the rule such as planning,notification and warning, communications and dissemination of information,there is adequate statutory authority in Sections 201 and 502 of the FederalCivil Defense Act.On the basis of Section 2(b)(4) of Executive Orders 12657 and 10 CFR 50.47(c)(1)(iii)(part of the NRC Emergency Planning rule), FEMA's rule assumes that Statesand local government will be involved in a response to an actual radiologicalemergency to the maximum extent possible using their best efforts.The Executive Order directs and the rule provides that FEMA will consultwith State and local governments continually, especially when determiningwhether ``a decline or fail'' situation exists, (andSection; 352.4(d)) andmobilizing a response to an actual emergency (See andSection; 352.27). Section2(b)(2) of the Executive Order states explicitly that ``(FEMA) shall takecare not to supplant State and local resources. FEMA shall substitute itsown resources for those of State and local governments only to the extentnecessary to compensate for the nonparticipation or inadequate participationof those governments, and only as a last resort after appropriate consultationwith the Governors and responsible local officials in the affected arearegarding State and local participation.'' Section 5(b) of the ExecutiveOrder directs FEMA to coordinate (and turn over) the response functionwhen State and local governments do exercise their authority.The rule contemplates that FEMA or other Federal agencies acting at FEMA'srequest would assist the orderly activation of State and local governmentresponse functions. As an example, FEMA might be called on to marshal resources,such as reception centers, which cannot readily be made available withoutpreplanning.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Standards and Criteria for FEMA Findings </ITAG>A number of commenters pointed to the lack of standards and criteria fordeterminations on such matters as ``decline or fail,'' ``participate adequately,''and the like. The standards and criteria for a review and evaluation of a licensee planand for an analysis of whether there is a decline or fail situation orwhether a State or local government is participating adequately in thepreparation, demonstration, testing, exercise or using such plans are thoseused in 10 CFR 50.47 Appendix E, and Part 70 and NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1Rev. 1 (November 1980) and Suppl. 1 (September 1988). A brief version ofthese is set out at 44 CFR 350.5. This regulation states in andSection; 352.7(Review and evaluation) that FEMA will use Part 350 (44 CFR 352.7) in makingfindings. Requirements applicable to State and local government plans areapplicable to licensee plans. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Realism Assumptions </ITAG>Several comments challenged the appropriateness and factual validity ofthe realism assumptions, namely, that in the event of an actual radiologicalemergency, State and local officials will exercise their best efforts toprotect the public, cooperate with the utility, and follow the utilityoffsite plan. Section 2(b)(4) of Executive Order 12657 provides that in carrying outits responsibilities under that Order, FEMA shall assume that in the eventof an actual emergency or disaster, State and local authorities would contributetheir full resources and exercise their authorities in accordance withtheir duties to protect the public, and would act generally in conformitywith the licensee's radiological emergency preparedness plan. These realismassumptions have been adopted by the NRC in 10 CFR 50.47 (c)(1)(ii). Theirvalidity has been approved in a court decision (<T3>Massachusetts </T3>v. <T3>United States of America, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </T3>856 F.2d 378, CA 1, 1988). The FEMA regulation is based on the realism assumptions addressed in andSection;352.25(c), and with respect to making determinations or commitment of resourcesunder andSection; 352.6, the assumptions are explicitly adopted as andSection;352.6(c)(2). <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Conflict of Interest </ITAG>A number of commenters claimed that since the regulation provides thatFEMA would both develop plans and review and evaluate them, this wouldbe a ``conflict of interest.'' FEMA is of the view that the term is neitheraccurate nor helpful in discussing the matter but, for lack of a betterterm, it will be used in discussion of this subject. The FEMA role set out in the regulation is based squarely on the ExecutiveOrder. FEMA's role as evaluator derives from Section 4 of the Order. Itsplanning function derives from Section 3. In order to implement the ExecutiveOrder pursuant to Section 6, FEMA must assume both roles. As discussedelsewhere in this document, FEMA is an executive agency implementing functionsvested in the President and delegated by him to the Director, FEMA. FEMAcan mitigate any perceived conflicts by internal delegations within FEMAso that FEMA officials who develop the plans will not evaluate their ownwork. Also, it should be noted that the plans developed pursuant to this Partare not FEMA's plans. FEMA assists licensees and State and local governmentsunder the Executive Order only in those limited situations where a ``declineor fail'' situation necessitates remedial action. FEMA also provides planningassistance to State and local governments under the Part 350 process (44CFR Part 350). This process is considered correctly to be a cooperativeeffort and not a conflict of interest. The process under Part 352 is nodifferent. It should also be noted that under NRC rules, FEMA findingsand determinations on the adequacy of plans are advisory in character andhave the status of rebuttable presumptions. These findings and determinationsare not binding on the NRC, which remains the sole judge as to the adequacyof planning and preparedness under NRC regulations. This arrangement is not altered in any way by this rule. All FEMA findingson plans developed under this Part will receive the same careful scrutinyand be subject to the same independent NRC judgment as all other FEMA findingsand determinations. Moreover, any FEMA findings and determinations, includingthose submitted to the NRC under this Part, can be challenged by any Stateor local government or members of the general public, as parties to controversiesbefore the NRC, as outlined in NRC Rules of Practice. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Due Process </ITAG>Commenters claimed that the interim rule did not provide procedures forcommenting or objecting to FEMA actions in the certification process. Thefinal regulation has been modified to provide for State and local governmentcomment on licensee certification (See andSection; 352.5(d)) and to providefor an appeal to the Director, FEMA, of determinations by the AssociateDirector (See andSection; 352.29). <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Administrative Procedures Act </ITAG>One commenter noted that andSection; 352.7 provides that, in the event ofan inconsistency between E.O. 12657 and 44 CFR Part 350, the ExecutiveOrder prevailed. A claim was made that FEMA was amending 44 CFR Part 350without going through the Administrative Procedure Act process for informalrulemaking 5 U.S.C. 553. FEMA has no intent to modify Part 350. The standardsand criteria set out in andSection; 350.5 are unchanged. In the unlikelyevent of an inconsistency between an Executive Order and a regulation,the Executive Order would prevail as it is the action of a higher authority;i.e., the President, while the regulation is the action of the Directorof FEMA. Other commenters expressed concerns on the application of theAdministrative Procedure Act to issuance of licenses by NRC, which is notpertinent to this rulemaking. The effect of Part 352 in NRC proceedingsis governed by NRC rules.Another commenter objected to issuance of an interim rule without the formalityof a ``proposed'' rule. Section 6 of Executive Order 12657 states thatFEMA shall issue interim and final directives and procedures implementingthe Order as expeditiously as is feasible, and in any event, shall issueinterim directives and procedures not more than 90 days following the effectivedate of this Order and shall issue final directives and procedures notmore than 180 days following the effective date of this Order which isNovember 18, 1988.FEMA continues to rely on its belief that meeting the Executive Order deadlinedid justify the departure from issuance of a proposed rule. As this ruleis basically a procedural rule, the Administrative Procedure Act does notrequire FEMA to have issued a proposed rule. FEMA's own procedures whichcall for a proposed rule (44 CFR 1.12) allow for an exemption in this case.Issuance of the interim rule, with request for comment, has afforded adequateopportunity to the public for comment.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Other Comments</ITAG>One commenter recommended that an on-site specific environmental impactstatement be developed as part of the certification process. In individualcases, FEMA is of the view that certification acceptance would not be amajor Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environmentand that use of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process isnot required under the NEPA statutes and regulation.A commenter on the fee reimbursement provision challenged the regulatoryflexibility analysis statement that the rule did not place burdens on localgovernments. Regulatory flexibility may be an issue in fee regulations,but since that subject is not specifically addressed in this regulation,there is no need to amend the preamble to the interim rule.The assistance described in this Part is not Federal financial assistancedescribed in 44 CFR Part 4 and, thus, does not require use of the intergovernmentalreview procedure described therein.B. Section-Specific CommentsSections 352.1 and 352.2 Definition and Scope,Purpose and Applicability<T3>Comment:</T3> A commenter suggested that Subpart A begin with the Sectionon ``Licensee certification'' and that the first two sections be introductory.<T3>Discussion: </T3>This would make it clearer that the scope and definitionssections apply to both Subparts A and B.<T3>Response: </T3>Adopted as andSection; 352.4 herein. Also, the Table ofContents has been amended by adding new andSection;andSection; 352.3 (Purposeand scope) and 352.29 (Appeal process).Section 352.1 Definitions<T3>Comment</T3>: 352.1(g) Local government. There were a number of suggestionsfor additions to this listing such as public school districts and villages.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The intent of the definition is to be as inclusiveas possible as reflected in the term, ``other jurisdictions,'' which encompassesother entities such as school districts and villages. This term is deemedto include all local political entities which might have a planning andresponse function.<T3>Response: </T3>No change.Section 352.1(h) <T3>Decline or Fail</T3><T3>Comment: </T3>A number of comments were made with respect to the definitionof decline or fail, some to expand and some to contract the scope of thedefinition. Thus, suggestions were made to delete the references to Stateand local inadequacies, while another commenter would have added an exampleof inadequacies such as ``lack of demonstrated timely action by State orlocal governments'' or similar evidence of failure to perform properly.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Executive Order applies whenever State or localgovernments, either individually or together, ``decline or fail'' to prepareemergency preparedness plans or to ``participate adequately'' in the preparation,demonstration, testing, exercise, or use of such plans. The term, ``declineor fail,'' as used in this regulation, is intended to cover all these circumstances,FEMA is of the view that the existing definition, slightly modified, isa fair reflection of the intent of the Order, and that further additionsor contractions would not be more accurate or complete.<T3>Response: </T3>The words, ``in a timely manner,'' are added after ``correctthose inadequacies'' to more clearly express the need for promptness inState and local actions.Section 352.1(q) <T3>Command and Control</T3><T3>Comment: </T3>A suggestion was made that the term, ``protective actionrecommendations,'' was more accurate and familiar to response organizationsthan ``protective action decisions.'' <T3>Discussion: </T3>It is believed that in the context of this regulationthe word, ``decisions,'' more accurately reflects the intent of the ExecutiveOrder. Therefore, no change is required.<T3>Response: </T3>No change.Section 352.2(a) <T3>Scope, Purpose and Applicability</T3><T3>Comment:</T3> As discussed heretofore in the general discussion a numberof the commenters asked about the purported lack of criteria for determinationsas to ``decline or fail'' and ``participate adequately.''<T3>Discussion:</T3> In most cases, ``decline'' is more or less self evident.The criteria used in evaluating a fail situation or determining the adequacyof participation in planning and preparedness are the same criteria usedin reviewing State and local plans under Part 350. That is NRC's EmergencyPlanning Rule (10 CFR Part 50.47, Appendix E and Part 70) and the jointFEMA-NRC criteria for preparation and Evaluation of Radiological EmergencyResponse plans and preparedness in support of Nuclear Power Plants, NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1,Rev. 1, (November 1980) and Suppl. 1 (September 1988). See 44 CFR 350.5(a).Section 352.6 states this. This is believed to be an adequate definitionof criteria.<T3>Response:</T3> No changeSection 352.2(c) <T3>Applicability</T3><T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters wished clarification of paragraph (c)to make it clearer that the regulation should not be construed or appliedto hinder a licensee's own efforts to develop response plans to the extentnecessary to achieve adequate emergency preparedness.<T3>Discussion:</T3> FEMA agrees that nothing in the regulation shouldbe construed to hinder the licensee's efforts developed under this Partor any other Part such as 350. Thus, FEMA should not, as suggested, developgeneric plans which can be used by licensees.<T3>Response:</T3> We believe the existing language adequately expressesthe concept that the licensee's effort independent of this Part remainsin full force and effect, is not superseded, and that if any further assistanceunder this Part is furnished, it is supplemental.Section 352.4 Licensee Certification<T3>Comment:</T3> A number of commenters suggested that the regulationshould indicate how long the certification applied and that there shouldbe provisions to address changing situations. Other comments of an editorialnature were made such as what evidence the licensee should submit to supporta finding of decline or fail, e.g., press releases or litigation positions.Also, a suggestion was made to add the words, ``or designee,'' after ``chiefexecutive officer'' in paragraph a. Additionally, a suggestion was madefor the licensee to send copies of the certification to other places suchas the NRC Regional Offices.<T3>Discussion:</T3> It would not be feasible to set out more specificperiods of time for certification as each case varies. Obviously, thereis authority to amend or modify the certifications or other determinationsat any time. While press releases or litigation positions are an indicationof positions of State or local governments for a document such as the certification,FEMA is of the view there should be formality. Therefore, the documentationshould show that there has been a written request to State or local officials,with response or a lack of response in a reasonable time, for participationin planning, commitment of resources, or timely correction of inadequacies.The host FEMA Regional Office distributes copies of the certification,and takes the official actions with respect thereto. It should controlthis dissemination of documents. Therefore, there is no need for the licenseeto send the certification anywhere but the host FEMA Regional Office. Thesuggestion to add the words, ``or designee,'' after ``chief executive officer''is not adopted, as it is believed that a request of this magnitude shouldbe made only at the highest level by the chief executive officer.Response: No change.Section 352.5 FEMA Action on Licensee Certification<T3>Comment:</T3> A number of comments were made on this Section, particularlywith respect to the time frame for actions. Some thought the period forFEMA review should be shortened or that actions or inactions should bedispositive of a FEMA decision, such as automatic approval if no finaldecision is made in 30 days. Some desired that a timeframe be establishedfor FEMA consultation with State and local officials.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Suggestions to shorten the time for FEMA to act in10 days, or to assume if FEMA does not make a final decision within 30days the certification is automatically accepted, are rejected. However,when a utility meets the requirements of the NRC emergency planning rule(See 10 CFR 50.47 (c)(1) (i) and (ii), FEMA will determine this to be dispositive.<T3>Response:</T3> A number of modifications have been made in this Sectionto allow for comment by State and local governments and a new andSection;352.29on appeals from interested parties, applicable to this and other Sectionshas been added.The FEMA Associate Director will make a decision within 45 days of receiptof certification by the Regional Director. Action on an appeal will becompleted within no more than 60 days after the date of the decision. However,during an appeal FEMA will provide technical assistance to a licensee.Section 352.6 FEMA Determination on the Commitment of Federal Facilitiesand Resources<T3>Comment:</T3> A suggestion was made that the realism doctrine, whichis set out as an assumption upon which all resource determinations aremade, should be reiterated in a number of places in Section 5 and elsewhere.<T3>Discussion:</T3> FEMA is of the view that this duplication is unnecessary.(See andSection;andSection;352.6(c)(2) and 352.25(c).)<T3>Response:</T3> No change.Section 352.6(d) <T3>Commitment of Resources</T3><T3>Comment:</T3> FEMA should advise State and local authorities of thefacilities and resources provided the licensee.<T3>Discussion:</T3> FEMA believes that State and local governments shouldbe kept fully informed of Federal Assistance provided to licensees.<T3>Response:</T3> The phrase, ``the States and affected local governments,''is added to the third sentence of paragraph d.Section 352.23 <T3>Functions of a Regional Assistance Committee (RAC)</T3><T3>Comment:</T3> A commenter noted that this section extended Part 351assistance to licensees, and suggested that the RAC be able to provideassistance prior to certification. This has been done in Shoreham and Seabrookcases already under Parts 350 and 351. The commenter thought that andSection;352.23 prevented RAC assistance prior to such certification.<T3>Discussion:</T3> FEMA is of the view that this is an incorrect interpretationof andSection; 352.23, and that assistance can be furnished prior to a certification.Paragraph (b) quite explicitly allows consultation on the needs for facilitiesand resources. The present practice of RAC cooperation in absence of Stateor local cooperation is permissible and encouraged. Such cooperation isfurnished under Parts 350 and 351 independent of the Executive Order andPart 352, and will continue to be so furnished. A suggestion was made thatmilestones be established in the regulation for Federal agency responsesin andSection; 352.23(d). These are inappropriate in a regulation but shouldbe established as part of good management technique.<T3>Response:</T3> No change.Section 352.24 Provision of Technical Assistance and Federal Facilitiesand Resources<T3>Comment:</T3> It was noted that technical assistance is referred toin andSection;andSection; 352.23 and 352.24. The difference between these usesof technical assistance residues with the intent of such technical assistance.Following a determination under Subpart A, technical assistance is intendedto be part of plan development and completion. Prior to a determinationunder Subpart A, technical assistance is intended to be provided to helpevaluate the need for Federal assistance and Federal facilities and resources.<T3>Response:</T3> An additional statement has been added allowing provisionof technical assistance during pendency of an appeal.Section 352.28 Reimbursement<T3>Comment:</T3> Utilities commented that State and local governmentswhose non-participation in emergency planning gave rise to this situation,should bear financial burden. Licensees should not pay for this. Licenseesshould not be the conduit for collecting fees from State and local governments.Objections were made by State and localities to charging non-participatingState and local governments for any costs, particularly costs of servicesor resources provided by FEMA or RACs. This was based on lack of legalauthority and lack of a request for such assistance. Also, one commenterfrom a locality within the EPZ, but not receiving any services or tax benefitsfrom a nuclear plant, objected to possible fees assessed against it.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The issue of reimbursement is presently being consideredin separate regulations on this subject, and will not be addressed in thisregulation. FEMA has issued a proposed regulation based on 31 U.S.C. 9701which is specific to FEMA, and not other agencies, which covers fees tobe charged to utilities for FEMA services and resources under both Parts350 and 352. 54 FR 27395, section 352.28 restates the Executive Order andwill not be revised.<T3>Response:</T3> No change.Section 352.29 Appeal Process<T3>Comment:</T3> Commenters desire that there be a procedure for a Stateor local government or a licensee to appeal the decision made by the AssociateDirector concerning a certification request by a licensee or a requestfor resources.<T3>Discussion:</T3> FEMA supports the rights of State and local governmentsor others to appeal FEMA decisions, a provision provided in Part 350.<T3>Response:</T3> A new andSection; 352.29 is added.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Certification</ITAG>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b),the Director has certified that this rule will not have a significant economicimpact upon a substantial number of small entities.
