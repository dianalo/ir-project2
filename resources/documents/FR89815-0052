In that publication and inthe FEIS, EPA inadvertently stated that, in the case of <T3>Chemical Waste Management</T3> v. <T3>U.S. Department of Commerce, et al., </T3>Civil Action No. 86-624,the United States District Court for the District of Columbia determinedthat neither the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) nor the National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) regulations implementing the CZMAauthorize a State to impose conditions unilaterally on EPA as part of theconsistency determination. In fact, no decision was rendered in the casebecause it was ultimately dismissed by stipulation of the parties withoutany court determination. The Proposed Rule should have stated that in theabove case, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Department of Justice tookthe position that the CZMA did not apply. However, in voluntary compliancewith section 307 of the CZMA and 15 CFR part 930, EPA has issued determinationsthat the proposed designations would be consistent with the CZMA policiesof the States of New York and New Jersey and has transmitted these determinationsto the respective States. In these determinations, EPA informed the Statesthat it would not take final action regarding site designations until 90days after the issuance of the respective determinations. The comment periodfor the proposed rule will be extended thirty days from the date of publicationof this notice of correction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received on or before September 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Send comments to: Mario P.
