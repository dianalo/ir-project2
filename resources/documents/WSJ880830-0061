The enemy isn't Nicaragua, South Africa, or even each other. It's drugs.    Mr. Bush has said he would appoint a &quot;council of war&quot; within his Cabinet to battle drugs. Not to be outdone, Mr. Dukakis recently gave a speech that used the term &quot;war&quot; 19 times to characterize the fight he would wage.    As the overheated rhetoric suggests, both presidential candidates have spent an inordinate amount of time discussing their plans for fighting drugs. There are some broad similarities in their proposals: Both support putting a single official in charge of coordinating all government drug-fighting efforts, for instance, and both endorse limited use of the military to fight drug trafficking.    But there are important differences in emphasis. Vice President Bush tilts heavily toward toughening law enforcement and criminal penalties, including instituting the death penalty for some drug crimes. Gov. Dukakis stresses helping improve local education and prevention programs to curb demand and to balance tougher federal law enforcement.    Above all, though, the drug debate turns on a question of credibility: Which candidate's experience shows he is better able to prosecute the &quot;war&quot;? Mr. Bush was heavily involved in the Reagan administration's drug efforts, but the explosion of the problem over the past eight years has raised doubts about his fighting skills. As governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Dukakis has run a well-regarded state drug program, but experts wonder whether he can translate that experience into a national program requiring a far broader approach.    In any event, the recent experiences of the two candidates are likely to greatly influence the approach each would take in the Oval Office.    Mr. Dukakis &quot;has a record that's generally better than most governors on this issue, and he seems more likely to experiment with some local solutions,&quot; says Peter Bensinger, who led the federal Drug Enforcement Administration through both Republican and Democratic administrations in the late 1970s. That makes Mr. Dukakis something of a political anomaly; Republicans are the ones who generally stress local and state programs, while Democrats are considered more likely to favor federal solutions.    Mr. Bush's statements, meanwhile, suggest he favors continuing the Reagan administration's trend of channeling more new federal spending toward enforcement programs than toward treatment and prevention programs, says Karst Besteman, executive director of the Alcohol and Drug Problems Association, an advocacy group. Mr. Besteman adds: &quot;I wouldn't call it good, I wouldn't call it bad. It's just unbalanced.&quot;    The drug issue is such a high priority for the two candidates largely because it has shot to the top of the list of campaign issues Americans care most deeply about. In a recent poll conducted for Americans Talk Security, a bipartisan program to sample voters' opinions on national-security issues, more people named drugs as the nation's most urgent national-security problem than any other issue. In another survey, the program found that 81% of the respondents favored using the U.S. military to interdict drug shipments.    The rapid emergence of the drug issue poses a particular problem for Mr. Bush, who must defend the administration's record despite evidence that drugs have become more plentiful and less costly in the past eight years. Mr. Dukakis has been able to attack the administration's record as &quot;criminal&quot; and &quot;ridiculous,&quot; as he did in a speech just last week.    Mr. Bush has been closely identified with drug fighting. In 1982, he was named to head a new South Florida Task Force charged with cutting the flow of drugs into Florida. The group helped increase narcotics seizures and was credited with slowing the influx of drugs into south Florida -- but law enforcement officials say many traffickers just shifted to new routes.    In 1983, Mr. Bush took charge of a broader administration drug-fighting group, the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System, which is credited with helping to coordinate the work of various law-enforcement agencies. But it has faded from view, its work largely assumed by a newer and more active National Drug Policy Board led by the attorney general.    In defending its record, the administration argues that the federal drug-fighting budget has tripled to $3.3 billion from 1981 to 1988. While it acknowledges that the drug problem has grown in the 1980s, it points to some signs that may indicate that attitudes about illegal drug use are at least starting to change: A University of Michigan survey found that cocaine use among high school seniors dropped by a third in 1987, to the lowest level since 1978.    Still, the administration in general, and Mr. Bush in particular, have been roundly criticized for allowing a close U.S. relationship with Panamanian strong man Manuel Noriega to continue until the dictator was indicted this year as a drug trafficker.    In addition, the administration often has been lukewarm in supporting increased spending for education and treatment clinics. Both the Justice Department and the Drug Policy Board, for instance, balked at supporting multibillion-dollar proposals in Congress for education and treatment programs in 1986 and again this year. Lawmakers also chide President Reagan for vetoing a 1983 bill that would have appointed a single Cabinet-level official to lead anti-drug efforts.    Mr. Bush says he would put his vice president &quot;in charge of every aspect of federal drug policy.&quot; He says he will demand stronger penalties for offenders, including mandatory sentencing for drug dealers. He endorses the policy pushed by some Justice Department officials of &quot;zero tolerance,&quot; meaning confiscation of vehicles carrying even small amounts of drugs and increased prosecution for possession.    Similarly, the Republican nominee favors proposed legislation that would strip drivers' licenses and federal student loans from repeat offenders. The centerpiece of his enforcement policies is his death-penalty proposal, which is aimed at big drug traffickers and those who commit drug-related murders.    After initially expressing reservations about broader use of the military for drug interdiction, Mr. Bush now favors the idea. He talks of forming an &quot;alliance of mutual assistance&quot; with Latin American countries to fight the drug trade, as well as an &quot;anti-drug leadership coalition&quot; with governors to promote education and treatment programs.    For his part, Mr. Dukakis endorses cutting off aid to foreign governments that won't cooperate in fighting drugs, while providing special aid to those that will. He wants a series of hemispheric summit meetings to discuss drugs. And he would authorize the armed forces to aid foreign governments in destroying drug crops.    But Mr. Dukakis seems most passionate about a &quot;National Alliance Against Drugs&quot; to coordinate domestic drug-enforcement efforts and expand the idea of the &quot;Governor's Alliance Against Drugs&quot; he formed in Massachusetts in 1984.    In the state program, nearly 300 cities and towns receive assistance to fight drugs by developing education programs, rewriting school discipline codes and improving treatment programs. In addition, the governor's office says, the alliance has coaxed businesses to make some $2.2 million in contributions to education programs in the past 20 months.    His proposed national alliance, Mr. Dukakis says, would be led by a federal anti-drug &quot;czar.&quot; It would step up federal support for local treatment centers, while also increasing federal aid to state and local law-enforcement agencies. Mr. Dukakis also pledges to make better use of laws for confiscating property and profits of drug dealers. (He doesn't favor the death penalty, though.)    Analysts give Mr. Dukakis's Massachusetts program generally high marks. Some question whether the state has spent enough on it, although statistics from the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors indicate Massachusetts ranked fourth last year nationally in state funding for alcohol and drug programs, and sixth in the number of drug and alcohol treatment units.    Perhaps more important, analysts wonder whether the program can be elevated to the national level. In Massachusetts, says Mr. Besteman of the Alcohol and Drug Problems Association, &quot;he was particularly instrumental in getting groups together at the local level. Well, you can't do that as president.&quot;    Some say the use of economic sanctions and other pressure by the U.S. -- tactics endorsed to some degree by both candidates -- could backfire by unduly annoying friendly regimes. Ted Carpenter, a scholar at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-oriented Washington think tank, concludes in a paper that the U.S. international anti-narcotics crusade amounts to &quot;an operational failure that threatens to become a diplomatic catastrophe.&quot;    ---                Where They Stand: Drugs   Major elements of the candidates' positions                           Bush   -- Put vice president in charge of government efforts   -- Create an international anti-drug force   -- Authorize death penalty for drug-related killings, major traffickers   -- Form &quot;alliance of mutual assistance&quot; with Latin American nations   -- Implement policy of &quot;zero tolerance&quot; toward drug possession   -- Enact mandatory sentencing for drug dealers                           Dukakis   -- Appoint anti-drug czar to lead a National Alliance Against Drugs   -- Let U.S. armed forces help foreign nations eradicate drug crops   -- Increase aid to state and local law-enforcement agencies   -- Cut off foreign aid to countries that won't co-operate in fighting drugs   -- Step up use of laws allowing confiscation of drug profits   -- Increase funding for local treatment and rehabilitation programs</TEXT></DOC>
