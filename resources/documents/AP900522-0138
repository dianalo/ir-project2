Yeltsin won applause from Russiancongressional deputies on Tuesday with a call to wrest control ofthe republic _ the Soviet Union's largest _ from the Kremlin.   Yeltsin, a rival of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, isseeking the presidency of the republic, which includes Moscow, 52percent of the nation's population and three-quarters of its land.   He told the Russian Congress the top-heavy Soviet politicalsystem ``continues to cling to life though its time has passed, andhas hurt Russia most of all.''   Yeltsin's sovereignty proposal for the republic resemblesmeasures passed by the three secessionist Baltic republics in thebeginning of their independence drives.   Under it, the republic would have final say over whether Sovietlaws and decrees are valid on its territory, which stretches fromthe Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean. The Russian republic embraces11 time zones and the vast oil, gas, mineral and gold reserves.   Congress was expected to vote on various sovereignty proposalsWednesday or Thursday, then turn to nominations for president. Thepresident is chosen by the Congress rather than in generalelections.   Yeltsin is running against Russia's premier Alexander Vlasov andseveral others. He has said he believes about one-third of theCongress' 1,059 deputies support him.   A Yeltsin victory could mean a loss of face for Gorbachev, whosepolicies are frequently and stridently criticized by Yeltsin.Yeltsin is a leader of the Democratic Russia bloc that made majorinroads into local and republic councils in March elections.   The sovereignty plan outlined by Yeltsin would involve allowingrepublics and businesses to set trade contracts freely amongthemselves rather than having to go through the central government.   Other deputies offered more extreme proposals. Irina Zalevskaya,a newspaper editor from the Ural Mountains city of Perm, declaredthat Russia must break from the Soviet Union if it wants truecontrol over its own affairs.   ``Full sovereignty requires the republic's secession from theSoviet Union,'' she said. Russia should eventually seek U.N.membership, form its own army and set up embassies in the other 14republics, she said.   Her vehement speech won hearty applause.</TEXT></DOC>
