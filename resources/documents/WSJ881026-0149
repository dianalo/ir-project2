In the wake of KKR's historic bid for RJR, representatives of the leveraged buyout firm and a group including RJR management held sporadic talks throughout the day. KKR's $90-a-share bid tops the management proposal by $15 a share, but the management group has the expertise in running the Atlanta-based tobacco and food giant. &quot;Both sides,&quot; said an RJR adviser, &quot;are trying to see if there's any middle ground.&quot;    At day's end, RJR executives were huddling in their midtown Manhattan offices, ready to examine their options well into the night. Topping their list of options is increasing their proposed $17.6 billion bid. An announcement of their decision could come as early as today.    Yesterday's talks began with a morning meeting between KKR's Henry Kravis and Peter A. Cohen, chief executive officer of RJR's financial backer, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Over breakfast in New York's Plaza Hotel, Mr. Cohen vowed that Shearson would continue pursuing its buy-out proposal with RJR management.    &quot;Our position was laid out to Kravis: He's very welcome to come on board, but he's got to recognize the fact that Shearson and management are going full speed down the path of constructing a proposal together,&quot; said a Shearson official. &quot;Whether Kravis wants to join management's team is a function of whether he wants to be viewed as friendly.&quot;    The meeting between Messrs. Cohen and Kravis was more civil than a previous session Friday, in which Mr. Kravis vowed to bid for RJR to &quot;protect his franchise&quot; in the field of big buy-outs. Though he said he would consider Mr. Cohen's comments, Mr. Kravis apparently has no intention of joining the RJR-Shearson team, KKR advisers said.    Rather, KKR placed phone calls yesterday to woo F. Ross Johnson, RJR's president and chief executive officer, and his management group to its side. That effort apparently met with little immediate success: RJR executives spent much of the day huddled with representatives of Bankers Trust Co. about funding for their buy-out.    The KKR effort faces a major hurdle in Mr. Johnson's friendship with James D. Robinson III, chairman and chief executive of Shearson's 60% owner, American Express Co.    &quot;Henry wants Johnson and his whole management team,&quot; said an adviser close to Mr. Kravis. &quot;We want and need to do this deal with Johnson. It's not a dealbreaker, but it's a decided preference. We have a record of dealing very fairly with management in terms of equity.&quot; KKR aides suggested Mr. Kravis would be willing to give RJR managers more equity than Shearson.    Outside investment bankers watching the deal predicted that Mr. Johnson might use Mr. Kravis's overtures to sweeten the KKR bid for RJR shareholders, or to increase the equity offered to the RJR management team. Privately, people close to senior RJR executives said they wouldn't rule out RJR eventually teaming with KKR's Mr. Kravis.    Though the meeting between Messrs. Cohen and Kravis was described as cordial, angry charges flew like hail behind the scenes. KKR, fiercely protective of its dominant position atop the buy-out field, argued that Shearson executives were risking alienating the numerous buy-out firms that form a large chunk of Shearson's lucrative merger-advisory business.    &quot;The more you look at this deal, the more its seems to us Shearson is putting big bets, even careers, on the line,&quot; said one KKR adviser. &quot;It seems to us Shearson has to decide what it's going to be when it grows up.&quot;    Shearson has long performed merger advisory work for KKR, generating about $10 million in fees for Shearson over the past two years. KKR advisers portrayed Shearson as an ungrateful adviser that, having learned the buy-out business at KKR's elbow, now is trying to steal its franchise. Shearson &quot;learned the business from us! Now they're turning around and trying to elbow us out of our own business,&quot; said one KKR adviser.    KKR apparently believes it needs to retain Mr. Johnson in order to effectively run the post-LBO company and dispose of certain of its assets. He knows the value of the businesses, for the purpose of asset sales, and he commands the loyalty of RJR's top executives.    Any deal involving Mr. Johnson, however, would have to give him more say in major management decisions than a leveraged buy-out firm would customarily allow. His arrangement with Shearson is believed to be as significant for the amount of business control it gives him as the equity participation.    KKR would also probably need the cooperation of Edward A. Horrigan to stay on to run R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Even if KKR were inclined to sell the tobacco business, which Mr. Horrigan heads, it might have a hard time finding a buyer. It needs experienced management to stay in place there. </TEXT></DOC>
