Lt. Gen. Naruedol Dejpradiyuth said fighting between rivalCambodian factions had intensified over the past month in parts ofthe country close to the Thai frontier.   He said it appeared that the three guerrilla factions opposingthe Hanoi-backed Phnom Penh government were taking the opportunityof the Vietnamese troop pullout to capture key positions.   Vietnam said that it had completed the withdrawal of its last26,000 troops from Cambodia on Tuesday.   Naruedol said a civil war was inevitable in Cambodia now thatthe Vietnamese have gone. Hanoi's withdrawal has given theguerrillas their best opportunity yet to oust the Phnom Penhgovernment, he said.   He said heavy fighting has been reported in the Ratanamondoldistrict near the important gem-trading town of Pailin.   There were also battles at Sisophon in Battambang province andin the northwestern province of Oddar Meanchey, he said.   The guerrillas have taken many important areas formerly held bygovernment troops, the Thai general said, including positionsopposite the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet and another furthernorth opposite the town of Ta Phraya.   He said the guerrillas killed many government troops andcaptured 15.   The Phnom Penh army was forced to bring in 3,000 extra troops tohelp defend areas in Battambang and Oddar Meanchey, he said. Thenew troops came from Phnom Penh and included draftees from KompongCham, located northeast of the capital, he said.   The general said morale among the government forces seemed lowand that since Sept. 20, 146 Cambodian government soldiers haddeserted their units and fled to Thailand. The latest group of 27arrived on Tuesday, he said.   Thailand is a major supporter of the resistance. Details ofNaruedol's battlefield reports could not immediately be confirmedby other sources.   Naruedol said that many heavy shells had fallen into Thailandfrom the fighting over the past month. Three Thai villagers hadbeen killed in the southern part of the border between the towns ofChantaburi and Trat, he said.   On Wednesday, thousands of refugees at a United Nations refugeecamp on the Thai border were forced to flee as hundreds of shellslanded nearby. They were believed fired by Cambodian governmenttroops reacting to Khmer Rouge guerrilla operations in the area.   The strongest of the guerrilla factions, the Khmer Rouge hasclaimed several victories recently, both near Sisophon and aroundthe gem trading center of Pailin.   Phnom Penh officials recently have admitted some setbacks atPailin.   One official said the Khmer Rouge was firing up to 2,000 mortarrounds a day at the town.   The fanatical communist Khmer Rouge was responsible for thedeaths of hundreds of thousands of Cambodians when it ruled thenation between 1975 and 1978, when Vietnam invaded.   Many Cambodians have said they fear a return to power by theKhmer Rouge. But Phnom Penh officials insist their army is capableof fighting the guerrillas without Vietnamese military support.</TEXT></DOC>
