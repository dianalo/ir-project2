The departures over the next five days would mark the first timeAfrican students have left China en masse since anti-black racialincidents in four Chinese cities during December and January.   Two Senegalese students, contacted this afternoon, said they werehappy to be leaving.   ``This is my pass to freedom,'' said one man, holding hisairplane ticket. ``I've been here 3{ years but it's felt like adecade.''   The other student, Alpha Ndirye, said today that he and six otherSenegalese students will stay behind to finish the school year andthen follow their countrymen home.   When they leave, Ndirye said, there will be no more students fromSenegal in China. He said the students were going home because``China is racist.''   ``Everywhere we go they still call us names and rub our skin tosee if we will become whiter,'' Ndirye said. ``The situation hasbecome intolerable.''   Two Senegalese diplomats contacted today refused comment.   The anti-black incidents began in the eastern city of Nankingwhen Africans and Chinese fought on Christmas Eve after Africanstried to bring Chinese girlfriends to a school dance.   Chinese later stoned the Africans' dormitory and marched throughNanking's streets, shouting ``Kill the black devils!'' and demandingAfricans involved in the fight be punished. One African was held bypolice for 25 days and two others were detained two weeks.   One of them, Alpha Robinson of Ghana, left China.   Lesser confrontations involving alleged racism against Africanstudents occurred in Beijing and two other cities. About 500Africans students boycotted classes at the Beijing LanguagesInstitute. They returned to classes on Feb. 22 after the end ofwinter vacation.   Ndirye said the Senegalise students who are leaving have beenliving in several cities, including Beijing and Nanking, and mostwere on Chinese government scholarships.   He and the other student said they planned to continue theireducation in Western Europe, preferably France. Senegalese speakFrench.   Ndirye praised the government of Senegal for honoring theirrequests to leave China.   ``We are different than other African countries,'' he said. ``Weare more democratic. If we want to leave a place they respect us.''   African students from countries such as Mali have complained thattheir governments were not permitting them to leave China.   In January, a report by the Nanking branch of the General Unionof African Students attacked African embassies for seeming to``ignore us until things get blown up into crises.''   Senegalese students today said they knew of several Ghanianstudents who were trying to leave China. But a Ghanian diplomat saidhis country had yet to decide what to do with the approximately twodozen Ghanian students in China.   And at least one student, Alex Dosoo, the one detained for 25days in Nanking, said he will stay. In January, Dosoo told TheAssociated Press he was determined to leave China.   About 1,500 African students, most on Chinese scholarships,currently study in China as part of Beijing's policy to cultivateclose ties with the Third World.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, asked today about theSenegalese, said he had heard nothing of their reported departure.   He reiterated China's position that ``there is not such aquestion as racial discrimination in China.''</TEXT></DOC>
