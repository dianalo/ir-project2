It also was no great surprise to his relatives that Cicippio,58, was kidnapped at the university gates in Moslem west Beirut,which had become a hunting ground for kidnap gangs seeking foreignvictims.   ``We kind of expected it,'' his brother Thomas, 63, said inNorristown, Pa. ``We tried to keep him from going to Beirut, but hehad made up his mind.''   The decade before his abduction was one of great change forJoseph Cicippio.   In the early 1970s, he was a Norristown bank manager, with sevenchildren, who led a Veterans of Foreign Wars drum and bugle corps.   His travels began after his 20-year first marriage ended in 1974and a second broke up a few years later.   ``I think at the time he had a lot of things on his mind, justwanted to get things sorted out,'' said his first wife, Theresa.``At the time, it appeared to me he just wanted to get as far awayas he could.''   Family members say he worked for a helicopter company inPennsylvania's Bucks County, was a shipping manager in Jidda, SaudiArabia, then for a hotel in London.   He took the job at American University in 1984, after a briefstay in California.   ``None of us wanted him to go, but ... he had applied for thejob and this is what he wanted,'' his brother said. ``He was usedto working overseas.   ``In my view he should have had some fear, because we were allvery concerned, but he was the type of person, once he made up hismind to do something, he did it.''   Joseph Cicippio was born in Norristown on Sept. 13, 1930, theyoungest of nine children in a Roman Catholic family. His fatherworked for the Pennsylvania Railroad.   He graduated from Norristown High School and attended bankingclasses at the University of Pennsylvania, Bucknell and Rutgers butdid not receive a degree.   Cicippio served in the Army in the early 1950s and, when he leftNorristown, was assistant vice president in charge of an AmericanBank branch.   In 1985 in Beirut, Cicippio married Elham Ghandour, a25-year-old Lebanese secretary at the U.S. Embassy. He waskidnapped shortly before he had planned to take her to the UnitedStates.   Helen Fazio, a sister, said he had a lot of work to do that dayand had left for the university an hour early.   His lawyer, James J. Oliver, said Cicippio sometimes joked inletters about the dangers of Beirut.   ``If things get too bad, I may not have any time to do anythingbut just run,'' he wrote on March 25, 1985.   ``The war has been getting hotter in the last two weeks. Havenot been off the campus in four weeks. The university feels I couldget kidnapped because of my position. Nonetheless, it's safer thanliving in N.Y. (Ha. Ha.).''   On Feb 18, he told Oliver: ``I am well, still ducking from thebombing and bullets flying all over the place. I hope to be in theU.S.A. sometime in June.''</TEXT></DOC>
