Also of great importance is the proximity ofhorizontal wiring to electrical facilities that generate high levels of EMIelectromagnetic interfence.) Motors  and transformers are typical examples ofthese types of sources.andM;Sidenote: This EMI issue is being talked about more and more becauseunshielded twisted pair is becoming such a hot medium for horizontal wiring.andO;Add to that the fact that people are transmitting data at faster and fasterspeeds over this type of wiring, and it looms even larger.andM;Paul Andres, executive vice president  of Mod-Tap, sees the speeds going upand up.andP;  He figures in the next three to five years speeds of 20 to 30 Mbpson unshielded twisted pair from closet to desktop won't be uncommon.andO;Technically, the problem with EMI and high-bandwidth over unshielded twistedpair is a matter of signal-to-noise ratios.andM;A cable with a lot of voltage on it can take a lot of noise.andP;  So an analogvoice signal's high voltage (relatively speaking that is - it's actually lowcompared to, say, AC voltage, but high compared to the very low voltage on adata line) can take a lot of noise.andP;  Horizontal twisted pair running at thosepreviously mentioned speeds is going to be transmitting data (with theaccompanying very low signal voltage).andP;  Thus, they'll be highly susceptibleto EMI.andM;From an application standpoint, it's easier to understand.andP;  After all, ifyou're sending voice over a wire, who cares if there's a little noise on it?andO;But if it's data and the noise is taking a one dollar check you'retransmitting and turning it into a million dollar payday for some lucky soul,you have a problem.andM;Of course, the quality of the cable and the way it's run isn't the onlyfactor here.andP;  All the other components have to be EMI-resistance too.andP;  Acheap Radio Shack termination device might be fine for voice, but its justnot going to cut it with high speed data transmission.andM;Like  the TIA  report points out you have to take care of business today ifyou're gonna be taking care of  business t o m o r r o w. Right now, it lookslike it's going to be incredibly fast over unshielded twisted pair (th a t'sour trend, not the report's).andM;TopologyandM;According to the report, &quot;the horizontal wiring shall be a star topology.&quot;andO;That means it's mandatory (sounds kind of biblical, doesn't it?).andP;  See figureA to get an idea how they want this set up.andP;  It also gives the maximumdistances of the runs.andM;Recognized CablesandM;There are four types of cables that are recognized in their grand scheme of ahorizontal wiring system.andM;1.andP;  Fourpair 100-ohm unshielded twisted  pair (UTP).andP;  The cable consists of24 AWG (American Wire  Gauge) thermoplastic insulated conductors formed intofour individually twisted pairs and enclosed by a thermoplastic jacket.andP;  Itmust meet all requirements of ANSI/ICEA (American National StandardsInstitute/Insulated Cable Engineers Association respectively) publicationS-80576-1988 applicable to four-pair inside wiring cable for plenum or general wiring within a building.andM;The requirements go on and on.andP;  We can't list them all, but we will list somemore.andP;  These are important especially if you're starting a job now or areshopping.andP;  After all, how many end users know what to look for in unshieldedtwisted-pair cable?andM;The cable must be listed and marked as required under the applicable NEC (National Electric Code) and local building code requirements.andM;The diameter over the insulation must be 1.22 millimeters (0.048 inches)maximum.andM;It must follow a strict color code: first pair, white-blue and blue; secondpair, white-orange and  orange; third pair, white-green and green;  fourthpair,  white-brown and brown.andM;The  diameter of the complete cable must be less that 6.35 millimeters (0.25 of  an inch).andM;The  ultimate breaking strength of the completed cable, measured inaccordance with  ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) D4565-1986, must be 40.82 kilograms (90 pounds) minimum.andP;  And the maximum safepulling tension should not exceed 11.34 kilograms (25 pounds)  to avoidstretching the conductor.andM;The cable tested in accordance with ASTM D 45651986 must withstand a bendradius of 25.4 millimeters  1 inch) max mum at a temperature of -20 degrees Cplus or minus 1 degree C without jacket or insulation cracking.andM;The resistance of any conductor, measured in accordance with ASTM 4566, mustnot exceed 28.6 ohms per 305 meters (1,000 feet) at a temperature of 20degrees C.andM;The resistance unbalance between the two conductors of any pair must notexceed  5% when measured in accordance with ASTM D 4566.andM;It goes on from  there, folks.andP;  The report is thorough in its requirements.andO;You have to be too.andP;  That's the great  thing about all this.andP;  It gives yousome concrete tools to work with when  you're dealing  with this stuff.andP;  Sureit's boring.andP;  But it's also incredibly important, whether you're an installerwho wants to take care of your customer's needs or an end user  who doesn'twant to go back and rip out the walls.andM;2.andP;  Two-pair 150-ohm shielded twisted pair  STP).andP;  It must meet therequirements of EIA (Electronic Industries Association) OmnibusSpecification, NQ-EIA/IS-43 and several other detailed specs.andM;3.andP;  50-ohm coaxial cable.andP;  Must meet the requirements specified in IEEE (TheInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 802.3-1989 (10BASE2).andM;4.andP;  62.5/125 fiber optic cable.andP;  Sorry.andP;  The specific performancecharacteristic for fiber and its associated connection hardware and cross-connects are under study by the association.andP;  However, most industryexperts  agree, though hot as a backbone medium, fiber is a long way off tothe desktop.andM;Speaking of backbones.andP;  BACKBONEandM;WIRINGandM;Backbone wiring interconnects the various telecom closets, equipment roomsand network interfaces in the overall  wiring system.andP;  It consists of thetransmission media, intermediate and main cross-connects, mechanicalterminations, interbuilding entrances (because all this stuff can be locatedin different buildings) and the transmission media between buildings.andM;TopologyandM;TIA recommends the conventional hierarchical star topology.andP;  See figure B.andO;The basic setup  is  each closet is wired to a main cross-connect or anintermediate cross-connect and then to a main cross-connect, with theexception of &quot;bus&quot; or &quot;ring&quot; configurations.andP;  They'll allow directconnections between the closets if you decide to go that route.andP;  Some othergeneral rules:andM;There can't be any more than two hierarchical levels of cross-connects in thebackbone wiring.andP;  Interconnections between any two closets must pass throughthree or fewer cross-connects.andP;  And only a single cross-connect can be passedthrough to reach the main cross-connect.andP;  Bridged taps, of course, are notpermitted here.andM;Recognized CablesandM;Due to the wide range of services and site sizes, the TIA recognizes thatmore  than  one transmission medium (type of cable) can be  used in backbonewiring.andP;  Their  standard specifies four transmission media, which, again, canbe used individually or in combination.andP;  They're the same as above, that is:100-ohm UTP; 150ohm STP; 50-ohm coax; and 62.5/125 fiber.andM;Factors you should consider when choosing a backbone medium or media are:flexibility in the kinds of services and applications it can support; howlong are you gonna need it?; and site size and amount of users.andP;  Some moreadvice from the TIA.andM;Business-needs for telecom services vary over time and from company tocompany.andP;  Plans for the future use of the backbone can therefore range fromhighly predictable to very uncertain.andP;  When you can, figure out the servicerequirements.andP;  Try to group them together in a few categories such as voice,display terminals, LAN (local area network) and other digital connections.andO;Within each group, individual types should be identified and requiredquantities projected.andM;When you're not sure, always use &quot;worst-case&quot; scenarios.andP;  General cablingrule-of-thumb: take care of your wildest growth dreams.andP;  That way you won'tget burned in the long run (though that's not guaranteed).andM;Each of their recommended cables are suited towards certain backboneapplications.andP;  Again, a single cable-type might not satisfy all of yourrequirements for a site.andP;  When you have to use more than one medium in thebackbone wiring, the different cable must use the same facility architecturewith the same location for cross-connects, mechanical terminations,interbuilding entrance facilities, etc.andP;  It gets crazy if you startseparating the multiple backbone media into different, distinct systems.andM;But let's get back to specifics.andP;  That is, after all, what we really likeabout this report.andP;  It gives us something to sink our cabling teeth into.andO;Let's talk backbone wiring distances.andM;First off, see figure C. That pretty much spells it out for you.andM;To minimize cable distances, it's good to locate the main cross-connect nearthe center of a site.andP;  Installations that exceed these distance limits can bedivided into areas, each of which are supported by backbone wiring satisfyingthese distance requirements.andM;Furthermore, the distance between the entrance facility (network interface)and the main cross-connect must be included in the total distancecalculations.andP;  Regulatory policies can also influence this distance.andP;  Andtelecom equipment connected directly to the main or intermediatecross-connects must do so on cables of 30 meters (98.5 feet) or less.andM;And, as with any wiring, whether it's horizontal stuff or backbone, propergrounding, complying with NEC requirements and other local codes, must betaken care of.andM;WORK AREAandM;The work area components in a wiring system is all the stuff from the telecomoutlet end of the horizontal wiring system to the station equipment.andP;  Thestation equipment can consist of phones, data terminals, PCs, etc.andM;Work area wiring is critical to a well-managed distribution system.andP;  However,it is generally nonpermanent, so it should be built to be relatively easy tochange.andP;  Thus, the TIA doesn't get big-time into the issues that surround it.andM;They do know that it will change from application to application.andP;  And theydo stress that any adaptations at the work area must be external to thetelecom outlet.andM;Here's some things you can do, again, other than changing the telecom outlet:add a special cable or adapter when the equipment is different from thetelecom outlet connector; add a  Y' adapter when you need to run two serviceson a single multipair cable; add passive adapters when the cable in thehorizontal wiring is different from the cable needed by the equipment; addactive adapters when connecting devices which use different signalling rates,like EIA 232 to EIA 422; and screw around with pair transposition forcompatibility.andM;The good news here is that several manufactures make all the stuff you'llneed to keep the desktop flexible - the Keptels, the Levitons, the AMPS, theSiemons, the ModTaps, the Panduits, the International Connectors, theSuttles, etc.andP;  See our roundup of building innovation stuff in the JuneTELECONNECT for all the poop on that stuff.andP;  It's gotten pretty easy tomanage.andM;TELECOM CLOSETandM;A telecom closet is an area within a building set aside for the exclusivepurpose of housing equipment associated with the overall telecom wiringsystem (more of their words).andP;  Every building needs one, but you can have asmany as you think you need.andP;  For overall specs on how to design a telecomcloset, consult the requirements of EIA/TIA-569.andP;  They set up a standard forthat some time ago.andM;CONCLUSIONandM;Like we said at the beginning of this article, this report is verycomprehensive.andP;  There's a lot in it we haven't even touched upon.andP;  Too big.andM;We've highlighted it for you so you can get a basic understanding of thedifferent components that must go into today's all-important wiring systemand to stress to you that it should be a primary concern, not merely asecondary one.andM;Again, none of this stuff is compulsory under any regulation.andP;  Yes, it ismeant to standardize wiring system installation.andP;  But its purpose is tosimply optimize performance and to take care of users' needs.andM;Bottom line: it does give some excellent guidelines to follow.andP;  We need it.andO;There are a zillion different ways to wire up your office.andP;  Most, however,are dumb and wrong.andP;  This details a correct way of doing things.andP;  Yep, nodoubt about it, we need something like this.andP;  More RegulationsandM;It seems like there is more legislation affecting building wiring than anyother area in telecom.andP;  Safety is the big reason.andP;  Though now we're startingto see more performance-based forces behind new laws.andM;For example, New Jersey has passed a new law that forces companies thatdesign and engineer telecommunication systems to have an in-house, licensedProfessional Engineer on staff.andP;  That's tough on a small interconnect'andM;And we're told from industry insiders that similar laws are gonna go down inother states as well.andM;For more information on the New Jersey law, talk to BICSI.andP;  And stay tuned.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
