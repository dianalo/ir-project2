(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Members of a gubernatorial commission arerecommending dramatic changes in land-use practices in Marylandbecause they are alarmed that population growth will doom theChesapeake Bay.   The proposal unveiled Tuesday also recognizes politicalrealities and tries to steer a middle course.   The drafting committee of the Governor's Commission on Growth inthe Chesapeake Region urged passage of legislation designed todirect growth to areas where its environmental effects will beminimized.   ``The time has come - not to stop growth - but to grow in alogical, efficient pattern. That's the goal of this legislation,''said Walter A. Frey III, chairman of the panel.   ``This is not an issue of growth versus no-growth,'' Frey said.``The committee's recommendations emphasized the need to protectboth the environment and the state's economy, because economicdevelopment is a key part of Maryland's quality of life.''   The draft plan would require local governments to submit forstate approval 30-year growth management programs. The programswould have to outlaw all new growth in environmentally sensitiveareas, such as land around streams and key wildlife habitats.   The local plans also would have to restrict new development onfarmland and in forests to one housing unit for every 20 acres.   In general, the proposal is designed to ensure that most newbuilding take place in existing communities or be ``clustered'' tosave as much land as possible.   Frey said by ending the sprawl that characterizes currentdevelopment trends in Maryland, as much as two-thirds of the landthat would have been used for building can be saved.   Despite the dramatic changes proposed by the panel, thecommission's chairman characterized the proposal as a moderateapproach.   ``It's my feeling what we are proposing is a minimal program,''said former Rep. Michael D. Barnes, D-Md.. ``I wish we could gomuch further.   ``We have in the bay today 1 percent of the oysters that werethere in our grandfathers' time. Our grandchildren are not going tohave crabs if we don't change.''   The draft plan will now be considered by the full commission andthen submitted to Gov. William Donald Schaefer in January, in timefor consideration by the 1991 General Assembly session.   Alarmed by projections that Maryland's population would jump by1 million during the next 30 years and the environmentalimplications of that increase, Schaefer last fall formed the Barnescommission. At the time he called for an ``action agenda.''</TEXT></DOC>
