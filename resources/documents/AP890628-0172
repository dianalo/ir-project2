The requirement would be ``an infringement on rights ofAmericans,'' said David Runkel, adding that the attorney generalwon't recommend that option to President Bush.   Under the task force suggestion, published this week as part of agun-control study, each person who buys a gun would be required tofirst obtain a firearms owner's identification card valid for threeyears. The study estimated that as many as 5 million cards would beissued annually.   An applicant would wait four weeks to six weeks after beingphotographed and fingerprinted while police determine if theindividual has been convicted of a felony.   Thornburgh opposed a similar idea in the 1970s when he headed theJustice Department's criminal division, Runkel said.   The identification-card option was one of several ways the taskforce offered to prevent felons from obtaining weapons. The taskforce didn't recommend any one of the options it suggested.   The study also noted that criminals would be able to obtainweapons on the black market even if an effective screening systemcould be devised.   Thornburgh is required by Congress to propose a screening systemby Nov. 18, but won't review the options until a public commentperiod ends in September, Runkel said.   Another option in the 40-page report, published Monday in theFederal Register, would require the nation's 270,000 gun dealers tocall local police before selling a weapon to determine if thepurchaser has a criminal record.   There are an estimated 7.5 million gun sales each year.   Requiring identity cards would force the FBI to hire 1,700additional clerks to check fingerprints. The system would costfederal, state and local governments $136 million to $161 million ayear, which could be financed by a user fee of $27 to $32, the studysaid.   Federal law doesn't require checks of those who want to buy guns.Twenty states, as well as the District of Columbia, require checksof the buyer's criminal history.   The task-force study was mandated by Congress last year. Rep.Bill McCollum, R-Fla., proposed the measure to head off a billrequiring a seven-day waiting period for gun buyers.   McCollum's measure was seen by many as an effort by the NationalRifle Association to stall gun control by requiring further study.</TEXT></DOC>
