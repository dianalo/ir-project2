Despite a strong effort by the administration to line upsponsors from both parties, only Democratic Sens. Donald W. RiegleJr. of Michigan, J. James Exon of Nebraska and John Breaux ofLouisiana signed on as co-sponsors.   The bill was introduced in the House with 57 Democratic and 90Republican co-sponsors.   Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I. and the bill's chief Senate sponsor,referred to the lack of Democratic support indirectly, commenting,``The introduction of the president's bill is not the end of theprocess, but a major advance in the march.''   Chafee, the ranking GOP member of the Senate EnvironmentCommittee, added, ``After eight years of silence from the WhiteHouse on this issue, we now have a chief executive who recognizesthe need for a major overhaul of the Clean Air Act.''   The administration moved on Wednesday to blunt criticism of thelegislation by meeting with environmental groups that havecriticized the bill.   ``At this point, it's an information discussion and not anegotiating session,'' said assistant EPA Administrator WilliamRosenberg, assistant Environmental Protection Agency commissioner,who met with top White House officials and seven environmentalgroups.   ``The administration's bill stands as it is,'' Rosenberg said,also telling reporters that President Bush had briefly dropped bythe meeting.   Richard Ayres, head of the National Clean Air Coalition,characterized the administration officials at the meeting as ``veryupset by the criticism the bill has got from the environmentalcommunity and members of Congress.''   ``We responded with equal vehemence that `we don't think you'vebeen unfairly attacked. We believe what we're saying is based onthe facts.'''   Participants said the administration promised future meetings.   The environmentalists, who have characterized the legislation asa gift to industry, said they told the administration the billwould not protect public health and in some cases weakens currentlaw.   The invitations to Wednesday's meeting immediately becamecontroversial because the White House initially failed to inviteAyres, whose organization is the main environmental lobbying groupon clean air. He was summoned to the White House just 15 minutesbefore the meeting began.   An EPA source said EPA Administrator William Reilly andRosenberg, assistant administrator for air programs, ``were shockedthat Ayres was not invited'' and demanded the White House changeits mind. The source spoke on condition of anonymity.   The meeting concentrated on the portion of the bill seeking tocurb acid rain, a form of pollution caused by emissions of sulfurdioxide and nitrogen dioxide from power plants, autos and othersources. These pollutants can be carried thousands of miles throughthe atmosphere, and eventually return to earth as sulfuric ornitric acids, ruining lakes, streams and forests.   Environmentalists have considered the acid rain section thestrongest part of the legislation, because it would reduce sulfurdioxide emissions by 10 million tons by the end of 2000 and ``cap''the lower emissions figure to prevent growth of the pollutant inthe 21st century.   But even this section has aroused criticism, withenvironmentalists contending the real sulfur dioxide decrease wouldbe 9 million tons, while nitrogen dioxide would actually grow by 1million tons by the end of 2000.   The major unhappiness, however, has been with the sections onurban smog and releases of toxic chemicals into the air, andRosenberg promised to hold further discussions on both topics,participants said.</TEXT></DOC>
