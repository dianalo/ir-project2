Sidman said the guarantee, effective with the 1990 high schoolgraduating class, was approved unanimously Tuesday night by thePlymouth-Carver Regional School Committee.   ``It is the school committee's response to the cry foraccountability and also to complaints we hear all the time aroundthe country about student skills in reading and arithmetic,'' hesaid.   Sidman said the school district will take an employer's wordthere is an educational deficiency and offer retraining. He said thedistrict has a strong adult education program, so it can keep itspromise.   The two-municipality district, he said, has about 2,500 studentsin three high schools about 30 miles south of Boston.   Sidman said the area, which has a heavy concentration oftourist-related businesses, offers many year-round jobs to highschool graduates.   ``The school board has been very concerned with the performanceof their students,'' he said. ``They want to let the community knowthey are responsive.''   The idea was based on a guarantee program offered by the Wayzata,Minn., school district, Sidman said.   David Landswerk, superintendent of the Minnesota district, saidin a telephone interview the program has succeeded in the two yearsit has been offered, and that not a single graduate has beenreferred back to the school by an employer.   Lucille Balombiny, Landswerk's executive assistant, said theWayzata program was approved by the school board in February 1987and took effect with that year's graduating class. The Minnesotadistrict includes eight municipalities and has about 1,700 studentsattending one high school.</TEXT></DOC>
