White said.   ``It is a truism to say that over the years Congress has come tobe the primary source of change in federal law ... the upshot hasbeen that much more of the work of the federal courts has involvedthe interpretation and application of statutory law,'' White saidin a speech Friday night before the American Bar Associationconvention.   In the past 50 years, White said, courts have determinedcongressional intent of a law based not only on the statute itself,but on it's ``legislative history,'' including committee hearingsand reports, debates on the floor and conference committee actions.   The courts follow the statutory language if it clearly relectslegislative intent, he said, but many cases involve ``ambiguouslanguage, and in these cases resort to legislative history has beenthe usual course,'' White said.   ``This is often a very large undertaking, taking hours and hoursof effort by judges, law clerks, and librarians, to say nothing ofthe time lawyers spend and charge for seeking to present thematerials that the judiciary has indicated are relevant todecision.''   With the increasing complexity of subject matter, JusticeAntonin Scalia is advocating a return to interpreting statutesbased mainly on the legislation's text, White said.   The debate over how statutes should be interpreted ``isextremely important since it involves how the courts may best carryout the will of Congress,'' he said.   Sometimes, White said, Congress is vague on purpose, to forcecourt decisions.</TEXT></DOC>
