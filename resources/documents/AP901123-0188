DRISCOLL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Soybean futures prices advanced at the Chicago Board of TradeFriday as a team of Soviet grain buyers prepared to come to thiscountry next week.   On other markets, petroleum futures were sharply higher; metalsposted gains; cattle advanced; and pork futures were mostly lower.   Renewed hopes of an emergency food deal with the Soviet Unionand a report that Brazil had reduced its planting by 15 percentgave soybean futures enough of a jolt to send prices up by morethan 11 cents a bushel in early trading.   ``There seems to be a consensus in the market that eventuallythe Soviets and the U.S. will come to terms'' on emergency aid,said Joel Karlin, a grain analyst in Chicago with ResearchDepartment Inc.   The Soviet team reportedly will be discussing export credits andtheir country's long-term grain agreement with the United States.How much attention will be given he Soviet Union's food needs forthis winter was not known.   Corn futures tagged along with the soybean complex, but wheatslumped lower.   But some of the gains in soybean futures eroded due tocommercial selling.   Wheat settled \ cent lower to 1 cent higher with the contractfor delivery in December at $2.48} a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2}cents higher with December at $2.22{ a bushel; oats were } cent to1\ cents higher with December at $1.08{ a bushel; and soybeans were3 cents to 4} cents higher with January at $5.82 a bushel.   The prospect of a U.N. Security Council vote next week on usingforce to remove Iraqi troops from Kuwait was the latest PersianGulf development to send petroleum futures sharply higher on theNew York Mercantile Exchange.   Prices opened higher following gains in London on ThanksgivingDay, when the Merc was closed.   The price gains were sustained because of the Persian Gulfdevelopments and the vague uncertainty produced by MargaretThatcher's announced resignation as prime minister of GreatBritain, said Brian Tagler, energy broker in New York with ShearsonLehman Hutton Inc.   Then late in the day came word from the British foreign officethat the U.N. Security Council may meet next week to take up thePersian Gulf crisis.   Light sweet crude oil settled 75 cents to $2.27 higher with theJanuary contract at $31.90 a barrel; heating oil was 2.10 cents to4 cents higher with December at 88.66 cents a gallon; and unleadedgasoline was 3.30 cents to 3.54 cents higher with December at 82.40cents a gallon.   Cattle futures were higher while pork declined on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange.   Cattle got a boost from the futures market's steep discount tocash prices and from stronger wholesale beef prices.   Expectations for lower cash hog prices on Monday kept porkfutures under pressure.   Live cattle settled .05 cent to .37 cent higher with theDecember contract at 79.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle wereunchanged to .25 cent higher with January at 88.02 cents a pound;live hogs were .20 cent lower to .20 cent higher with December at53.45 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .22 cent to .40cent lower with February at 71.40 cents a pound.
