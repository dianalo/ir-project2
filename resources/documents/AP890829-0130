A strong statement issued at the State Department followed what aU.S. official said was a recent worsening of the situation and aninability by Turkey to absorb many more than the 311,000 ethnicTurks who have taken refuge in the country.   While estimates vary, about 1 million people of Turkishextraction live in Bulgaria where, according to the StateDepartment, they are systematically denied the right to speak theTurkish language and practice Turkish culture.   The Turkish government recently required visas of ethnic Turksemigrating from Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government accused Turkey ofhypocrisy.   Turkish border officials said they had strict orders to turn awaythe refugees waiting to cross into Turkey. However, thesemi-official Turkish news agency Anatolia said hundreds wereallowed to enter without visas last week.   Turkish opposition parties accused the government of backing awayfrom its pledge to accept all ethnic Turks who wanted to come, whileBulgaria blamed Turkey for refusing to hold talks on an immigrationagreement.   The Turkish ethnics, with strong U.S. support, accused Bulgariaof forcible assimilation, beginning in 1974, that made practicingIslamic rites more difficult.   ``The situation just continues to get worse,'' said RicharrdBoucher, the State Department spokesman, said. ``Repressioncontinues.''   He said Ambassador Sol Polansky had been recalled from Sofia``for consultations'' and that the Bush administration wasconsidering assistance for the refugees.   ``The ongoing abuse of the human rights of Bulgarian ethnic Turksby the government of Bulgaria remains an issue of serious concern tothe U.S. government,'' the statement said.   ``The U.S. has made its views on this matter known to thegovernment of Bulgaria both publicly and privately, and PresidentBush has spoken several times to Turkish leaders to express ourstrong support for their efforts to end this tragic situation,'' thespokesman said.   Simeon Darpatov, spokesman for the Bulgarian embassy, denied theallegations. He said Turkey had set preconditions for discussing theproblem with his government, including recognition of a distinctTurkish ethnic group in Bulgaria.   ``There should be a dialogue between the two neighoring countriesand we are not pleased when other countries interfere in bilateralrelations,'' Darpatov said.   The Bulgarian diplomat said ``nobody has been persecuted for hisreligion'' in the country.   Darpatov said his government, in accord with the 1975 Helsinkiaccords, permits all of its citizens to travel abroad.</TEXT></DOC>
