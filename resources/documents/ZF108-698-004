 But itwill function only on computers equipped with a special access card.andM;&quot;If you don't have the card in the system you cannot translate,&quot; saidRichaud.andM;Physically, the access card looks like a credit card, but it includes amicroprocessor which counts the words and manages the program and passwords.andM;Richaud said the price for the card falls between two and three cents a word.andO;Cards are sold in amounts of 100,000 to one million words.andM;&quot;Rather than selling the computer program, which we would have to sell at ahigh price, we're selling the card ...andP;  The idea was to make this system anaffordable product for everyone,&quot; he said.andM;The system can process the work at a rate of 250,000 words an hour (more than4,000 a minute) with only the editing left undone, he said.andM;&quot;With this kind of speed it means that you can roughly translate one page persecond.&quot;andM;However, he added that the XLT System is marketed as a &quot;productivity tool&quot;and not as a system that can do a final translation.andM;&quot;Nobody can do final translations now, and I doubt very much whether it canbe possible or affordable.&quot;andM;Rought draft producedandM;The raw text produced by the XLT System is equivalent to a first &quot;roughdraft&quot; translation, technically correct but which needs to be reviewed andcorrected to achieve its final form.andM;The XLT Computer-Assisted Translation System derives its name from computerterminology.andP;  Computer programmers and operators used the code word XLT (orXLTR) as an assembly language instruction meaning &quot;translate&quot;.andM;With the XLT System, entry of the source language text is extremely easy,said Richaud.andP;  For typed or printed documents an optical characterrecognition (OCR) scanner can be used.andP;  Data can also be input from wordprocessing disks, modem communications or electronic mail.andM;Along with the translation software, other utilities are integrated into thesystem for communications, word processing and terminology databasemanagement.andM;The system's general dictionary contains more than 40,000 roots with morethan 200,000 variations.andP;  &quot;The word bank that it has is totally open to theuser,&quot; said Richaud.andP;  &quot;It's up to the user to customize the system with thewords of his own trade.&quot;andM;The capacity of the hard disk is the only limit to the number of words andglossaries that can be maintained.andM;Richaud said translations from French to English will be available for theend of this year.andP;  capability for other languages, such as Italian andGerman, is currently being developed, for probable introduction at the ParisSalon Comdex show in the spring of 1991.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
