A standardized SEM-procedure (VDI-Guideline3492) as well as a TEM-method were used for the measurement and identificationof asbestos fibers in ambient air. The ambient air asbestos fiber concentrationsmeasured by means of the SEM-method were in the majority of cases lowerthan 100 fibers (longer than 5 {mu}m)/m/sup 3/. About 46% of all othermeasured asbestos concentrations in ambient air, which were higher than100 fibers/m/sup 3/, lay in the range between 100 and 200 fibers/m/sup3/. In about 42% of all these cases the asbestos fiber concentrationswere in the range 200 and 1000 fibers/m/sup 3/ and in 12% of cases theasbestos concentrations in ambient air were higher than 1000 fibers/m/sup3/.</TEXT></DOC>
