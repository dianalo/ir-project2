(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The courtroom battle for the child onceknown as Baby M ended last week when the woman who bore the childunder a surrogate contract won greatly expanded visitation rights.   Now the dispute over 2-year-old Melissa Stern's future moves outof the public eye and into the privacy of the counselor's office.   Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, the child's biological mother, andWilliam and Elizabeth Stern, who have custody of the girl, havebeen ordered to undergo counseling to come to terms with their newand complicated relationship.   The Sterns and Mrs. Whitehead-Gould disagree over how how easyit will be to work out their problems.   The Sterns still distrust Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and feel shedoesn't have the child's best interest in mind, said Frank Donahue,a lawyer for the Tenafly couple.   ``I think to make this work, Mary Beth is going to have torecognize that although she's the mother, Bill and Betsy are theones who are going to shape and form this child and they will bethe role models,'' Donahue said.   But Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorney, Joel Siegal, said the newarrangement will ``proceed much more quickly than the partiesthemselves realize.''   ``They're all nice people; they're intelligent. They all loveMelissa. They recognize that it's counterproductive not tocooperate,'' he said.   Wednesday's ruling by Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween wasthe final legal word in a dispute that began moments afterMelissa's birth on March 31, 1986, and went on to capture worldwideattention.   Both sides enter into their new relationship with victories andlosses in the courts.   The Sterns _ he a biochemist, she a pediatrician _ won custodyof Melissa in a Feb. 3 New Jersey Supreme Court ruling that upheldthe custody portion of a March 31, 1987, lower-court decision. TheSupreme Court then returned the case to Superior Court to resolvethe visitation issue.   The Sterns, both 42, had hired Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, 31, to bearthem a child for $10,000 by being artificially inseminated withStern's sperm.   When the child was born, however, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould changedher mind about the arrangement and refused to give up the baby. Nomoney ever changed hands.   Under Sween's visitation ruling, the Sterns will be in charge ofmost of the child's upbringing, including such matters as educationand religion. In effect, Stern will be the father, Mrs. Stern thestepmother.   But the Sterns lost their fight to cut Mrs. Whitehead-Gould offcompletely from the child. Sween granted the East Brunswickhousewife immediate, unsupervised visitation for six hours one daya week.   The judge ruled the visitation is to be expanded to include anextra day every other week, overnight, some holidays and a two-weekvacation in the summer of 1989.   The visitation and the counseling are to begin immediately, butthe exact dates were put under seal by the judge.   Lori Andrews, a researcher with the American Bar Foundation whohas followed the case closely, said the key to protecting the childis cooperation among the adults.   ``If the parties can see it as a final action and cooperate,there's less of a chance of harm. If they're both trying to enlargetheir rights constantly, the child will become more of an object,''Ms. Andrews said.</TEXT></DOC>
