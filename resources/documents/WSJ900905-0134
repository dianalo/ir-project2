Boyar's Aug. 21 letter to the editor dismissesthe national honor of the Ukraine on the basis of the welcomegiven to the invading German army of World War II. Suchdismissal ignores the most critical component of Ukrainiannationalism, namely the view that the Ukraine was a nationoccupied by Russian imperialism. It is worth rememberingthat, prior to Operation Barbarossa, the Russians hadsubjected the Ukrainians to severe repression during theagrarian uprisings, at an estimated cost of more than threemillion lives.   With this history, even a Nazi convoy could be mistakenfor a troop of white knights, under the presumption that theUkrainians were being liberated from their Soviet captors.When this proved to be a false hope, the Ukrainian partisansput up a heroic fight to expel the Germans.</LP><TEXT>   As evidence of Ukrainian fickleness, Ms. Boyar relies on asingle reference to how some Ukrainians acted under thepressures of concentration-camp life. As one who has neverbeen subjected to those horrors, I would not judge themorality practiced by those victims -- and neither should Ms.Boyar. After all, even the Jewish camps had their kapos.
