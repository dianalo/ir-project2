The Japan Foreign Trade Council said export contracts concluded by the country's 17 biggest trading concerns rose 2.8% in June from a year earlier, to 1.047 trillion yen ($6.9 billion), while import contracts grew 4.6%, to 1.131 trillion yen. In May, export contracts had declined 15%, while import contracts had risen 3.3%. The council said June's figures marked the first time in 19 months that both export and import contracts increased.    The 17 companies handle about 50% of Japan's exports and 65% of its imports. The council's statistics are considered an early indicator of the nation's short-term trade trends.    In a bearish report, meanwhile, the Japan Iron andamp; Steel Federation said that Japanese steel exports fell 19% in June from a year earlier, to 2.2 million metric tons, continuing a prolonged slump caused by the yen's strength and growing competition from other countries.    In the first half, the federation added, exports fell 13%, to 12.8 million tons.    The outlook for steel exports is &quot;really up to changes in the yen's rate against the dollar,&quot; a federation spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
