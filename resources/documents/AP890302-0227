The returnees were beginning the first repatriation program forboat people no longer willing to languish in crowded detentioncenters.   The English-language South China Morning Post, in a report fromHanoi published Friday, Vietnam's director of immigration upbraidedthe boat people for leaving the country illegally.   Officials told the group during a meeting at the airport'simmigration hall they could face 30 years in jail if they tried toflee again, the paper said.   The boat people, who were met by about 30 friends and relatives,spent the night at a makeshift reception center near the Vietnamesecapital's airport, the report said.   They were among about 11,000 Vietnamese who sailed into Hong Kongafter this British colony adopted a tough new policy last year thatfor most of them rules out resettlement.   The 2{-hour flight marked the first large-scale repatriation ofboat people, who have sailed by the tens of thousands to seek asylumin non-communist Southeast Asia.   Many of the returning 46 men, 19 women and 10 children boardedthe U.N.-chartered Boeing 737 jet smiling, waving and shaking handswith local officials. Several wore new clothes; a few carriedcassette tape players.   When their plane touched down in Hanoi on Thursday evening, theywere met by Vietnamese, British and U.N. officials, Hong Kong radioreported. Relief officials aboard the airplane said there was notension during the flight, it said.   ``I'm happy to be back,'' Lan Bun See told reporters as hestepped off the plane. ``This is my homeland. I feel ... veryhappy.'' The group was whisked to the passenger terminal by coachwhere they were rushed through immigration, reports from Hanoi said.   ``This is an important start,'' said Security Branch officialMichael Hanson, who watched the group leave Hong Kong. ``We hopemore people will take this route back to Vietnam'' and relieve thecrowded camps that are home to about 26,000 boat people in Hong Kong.   The repatriation was arranged under an agreement reached byVietnam and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Hanoi promisednot to prosecute its returning citizens and to allow theinternational organization to monitor their treatment back home.   The U.N. commission agreed to provide assistance to therepatriated Vietnamese. Returning adults received $50 and theirchildren $25, according to U.N. officials, and other unspecifiedassistance will be offered.   Two U.N. officials flew back with the group and were expected toaccompany the Vietnamese to their hometowns.   Hong Kong, about 500 miles north of Vietnam, long classified allarriving Vietnamese as refugees who could stay in the colony untilresettled elsewhere. Fewer than two dozen of the more than 120,000Vietnamese who have come to Hong Kong returned home between 1979 and1988.   But to stem a growing influx of boat people, the colony adopted anew policy in June under which Vietnamese are considered refugeesonly if they can prove they fled their homeland because ofpersecution.   The vast majority of the 11,000 boat people who have arrivedunder the new policy do not meet that standard under a Hong Konggovernment screening program and are classified as illegalimmigrants who fled their impoverished homeland for economic reasons.   Hong Kong wants to send them home forcibly, but Hanoi insists itwill only accept boat people who want to return.   Despite the new policy, boat people continue to sail to thecolony, with 356 arriving last month, up from 114 in January and 91in February 1988.   Resettlement of the 15,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong camps who havebeen granted refugee status have received a boost with severalcountries, including the United States, agreeing to increase thenumber they accept.</TEXT></DOC>
