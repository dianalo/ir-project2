The Finance Ministry said Friday that the current-account surplus shrank to $6.85 billion in February from $7.63 billion a year earlier. After seasonal adjustment, the surplus stood at $7.86 billion, down from $8.03 billion in January.    Last December, the surplus widened on a year-to-year basis for the first time in eight months. But it narrowed in the subsequent two months, heartening government officials who have been pressured by other nations -- largely the U.S. -- to narrow the surplus.    The current account comprises trade in goods and services, as well as some unilateral transfers. In its report, the Finance Ministry said Japan's merchandise-trade surplus narrowed to $7.44 billion in February from $8.28 billion a year earlier. After adjustment, the surplus was $8.45 billion, down from $9.10 billion in January.    Unadjusted imports rose 45.1% from the year before, to $12.43 billion. Officials said imports of manufactured goods surged a record 77.5% and accounted for 48.8% of total imports. They ascribed the large increase to expanding domestic demand and to the strong yen, which makes imports less expensive.    Exports, meanwhile, grew at a slower 17.9%, to $19.87 billion. Officials said exports of motor vehicles, computers and semiconductors were strong.    After seasonal adjustment, imports fell 1.2% from January, to $12.48 billion, while exports declined 3.7%, to $20.93 billion.    Ministry officials said recent Japanese trade reports showed a &quot;desirable&quot; pattern. &quot;We can't say anything definitive, but we have a feeling that this pattern is going to continue in the future. We certainly hope so,&quot; said one official.    Officials noted that when the current-account surplus is measured in yen, it has declined steadily for 11 months.    Japan reports two sets of merchandise-trade figures for each month. It first reports trade figures that are measured when goods pass through customs; in that report, imports include freight and insurance costs, but exports don't. When the current-account report is released, the ministry includes a second set of merchandise-trade figures that measure imports and exports when contracts are settled; in this case, neither imports nor exports include freight and insurance costs.    Last month, the government said the February trade surplus narrowed to $5.24 billion from $7.13 billion a year earlier and to a seasonally adjusted $6.46 billion from $7.79 billion in January.    Separately, the statistics bureau of the prime minister's office said that Japanese unemployment stood at a seasonally adjusted 2.7% in February, unchanged from January but down from 3% a year earlier.    Reflecting the economy's steady improvement, the bureau said, the number of job holders rose by one million from the year before, to 58.03 million. February was the third consecutive month in which the number increased from the year before by at least one million.    Japanese manufacturers have been hurt by the strong yen's impact on export prices. But the employment report said growth in the number of job offers was led by the manufacturing sector, where offers rose 56.9% from a year earlier.    A Labor Ministry spokesman said, &quot;It is necessary to watch closely the trend of the employment situation . . . there are still areas of Japan and sectors of the economy which have recently been in a slump, but the overall employment situation is showing steady improvement.&quot;    ---   Current Account in France   Special to The Wall Street Journal   PARIS -- France swung to a current-account deficit of 8.69 billion francs ($1.55 billion) in the fourth quarter from a year-earlier surplus of 11.46 billion francs, the Economics Ministry said in a provisional report.    After seasonal adjustment, the fourth-quarter deficit was 15.08 billion francs, sharply wider than a revised third-quarter gap of 6.43 billion francs.    The fourth-quarter figure left the deficit for the full year at 26.71 billion francs, in contrast to a year-earlier surplus of 20.19 billion francs.    The trade deficit ballooned last year to 53.17 billion francs from 13.29 billion francs in 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
