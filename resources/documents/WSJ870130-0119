The report, released yesterday, disputes the idea that the declining international competitiveness of U.S. industry is at the root of the nation's enormous trade deficits. Instead, the report argues that the trade deficits are purely the result of such broader economic problems as the high value of the dollar in recent years, large budget deficits and slow growth overseas.    The report principally reflects the views of the three free-market economists who head the council, but it also underscores the deep ambivalence in the Reagan administration about the competitiveness issue. The chapters of the report were reviewed by the White House and other agencies before they were released.    President Reagan on Tuesday unveiled a package of 43 initiatives to boost U.S. competitiveness, including a major new proposal to toughen U.S. trade laws. But the package was in many ways a defensive measure. It was designed to head off the efforts of members of Congress and others in Washington who want to use the banner of competitiveness to promote protectionist trade legislation, increase spending on education and training programs, or reinstate tax breaks that encourage research and investment.    The report argues that manufacturers' productivity has been growing strongly over the past five years. It has &quot;exceeded the postwar average and substantially exceeded the sluggish rate of productivity growth during the 1970s,&quot; the report says. In the absence of changes in the dollar's value, the improved productivity &quot;would have improved U.S. international cost competitiveness.&quot;    The report does note, however, that President Reagan's proposals could help &quot;enhance further U.S. productivity and competitiveness.&quot;    In a separate chapter, the report attempts to debunk the notion that the U.S. trade balance is the result of unfair foreign trading practices. It also argues that trade legislation -- including that being proposed by the president -- will do little to reduce the deficit. &quot;Trade balances are largely macroeconomic phenomena, not related directly to market access barriers or unfair trade practices by foreigners,&quot; the report said.    The council is headed by Beryl Sprinkel; the other members are Michael Mussa and Thomas Moore. The economists' 225-page report accompanied the annual &quot;Economic Report of the President.&quot; In his six-page report, President Reagan called for continued restraint on federal spending, efforts to strengthen productivity and competitiveness and the overhaul of U.S. farm policies.    Testifying about the report before the congressional Joint Economic Committee yesterday, Mr. Sprinkel said he expects the economy to perform better this year than last year because &quot;many of the problems that have adversely affected the economy are behind us.&quot;    He noted that oil prices have stabilized after last year's steep decline, and that the dollar has come down substantially from its heights of two years ago. He said he expects the lower dollar to reduce the nation's trade deficit about $30 billion this year, from last year's record of about $170 billion.    Mr. Sprinkel said that, in preparing its report, the council &quot;has made no assumptions about the future course of the dollar,&quot; and refused to say whether further declines in the dollar are needed to stem the trade deficit. He said that his economic projections were based on the assumption that Congress will enact spending cuts to narrow the budget deficit, and that Japan and West Germany will take steps to boost their own economic growth.    The Reagan administration has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to stimulate growth in order to increase their imports of U.S. products and help narrow the deficit. </TEXT></DOC>
