The rebelsacknowledge they made a tactical error in boycotting the February1986 election between Marcos and Mrs. Aquino, held two weeks beforethe uprising.   After taking power, Mrs. Aquino freed hundreds of politicalprisoners, including party founder Jose Maria Sison, who now livesin the Netherlands. She offered peace talks and negotiated a 60-daycease-fire in December 1986.   Rebel leaders such as Satur Ocampo and Antonio Zumel, bothformer journalists, emerged from years in the underground to appearon television talk shows and public rallies.   Both joined nearly 100,000 people in a funeral march for slainlabor leader Rolando Olalia during which communist flags wereopenly displayed.   The rebels also used the cease-fire to infiltrate nearly 3,000``armed city partisans'' into Manila. After peace talks collapsedand fighting resumed, guerrillas launched a campaign of streetassassinations, killing nearly 100 police officers, soldiers andcivilian officials during 1987 in Manila alone.   But rebels acknowledge that the urban strategy failed.Indiscriminate killings alarmed the urban classes. They alsoprompted sometimes draconian responses from the police.   In Bacolod, police drew up a list of suspected left-wingsympathizers and warned the rebels they would liquidate five ofthem for every policeman slain. Street killings there ceased.   Manila police organized a network of armed informants andlaunched a series of mass raids in which hundreds of civilians wererounded up for questioning.   The strategy led to protests from human rights groups butprompted slum dwellers to turn in guerrillas to avoid harassment.   Human rights groups even took out paid advertisements in Manilanewspapers urging the rebels to scale down their killings for fearthe military would target them in reprisal. The military claimssuch groups are rebel sympathizers.   The military claims the failure of the urban strategy led to ashake-up of the party's Manila branch in which more than 50 memberswere investigated, either for mistakes or as suspected militaryinformants. Some of them were executed, the military claims.   In a recent issue of its official organ Ang Bayan (The Nation),the central committee acknowledged it was reassessing ``the natureand style of operations of armed city partisans'' and would be moreselective in choosing targets.   The rebels apparently are gambling that killing an Americancolonel will not elicit the same public outrage as indiscriminateattacks on lowly Filipino policemen.   Meanwhile, rebel offers of peace in return for closing the sixU.S. bases appear to be a bid to build support among urban groups.Opposition to the bases is substantial among the nationalisticintelligentsia and the urban classes.   Mrs. Aquino has not accepted the offer, and the rebelsapparently hope this will make her appear an ``American puppet'' inthe eyes of many Filipinos.   Meanwhile, the rebels have put new emphasis on rural organizing.About two-thirds of the 58 million Filipinos live in rural areas,which have so far not benefited from improvements in the economy.There, the rebels hope to expand their system of shadow governmentsand recruit followers.   ``We are now trying to professionalize leaders in preparationfor building provisional revolutionary governments,'' said onerebel official on Negros Island, who used the pseudonym FidelCastro. ``We also need a higher level of training'' to combatgovernment counterinsurgency strategy, he said.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said in December that rebels haveseized more than 76,500 acres of land nationwide and aredistributing tracts to landless farmers.   The military last September drafted a two-stage, three-year planfor crushing the insurgents. The first stage, which is nearcompletion, calls for retraining troops, reorganizing commandstructures and selecting targets.   The second phase, beginning this spring, calls forsystematically eliminating rebel forces, first in remote mountainsand jungles and then nearer towns and cities.   Under the plan, the military is training and deploying thousandsof civilian militiamen to augment rural security. Plans called fordeploying about 80,000 militiamen, but the figure was scaled downto about 50,000 because of budget restraints.   Military and civil officials concede that the campaign cannotsucceed unless the government can improve the livelihood of itspeople, provide essential services and eliminate social injusticesthat are still widespread.   ``There are disturbing signs that basically the situation of ourpeople has not changed,'' said The Manila Chronicle in aneditorial. ``Seventy percent still live in abject poverty and thereare those who hold power, wealth and influence who have not learnedto share resources with the majority. For as long as these symptomspersist, the insurgency will find a fertile and hospitable ground.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 21</NOTE></DOC>
