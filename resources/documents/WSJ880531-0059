What would have happened if the jet hadn't held together for 13 minutes while the pilots pulled off their miracle landing last month?    The fate of another early Boeing 737 suggests a grim answer. On Aug. 22, 1981, the plane was flying across the island of Taiwan when it suddenly disintegrated in midair, sending all 110 people aboard to their deaths. The U.S. team investigating the Aloha accident hasn't seen a report that Taiwan did on that earlier accident, so parallels between the two crashes haven't received much scrutiny.    But they will.    Like the Aloha plane, the Taiwanese jet ruptured as it neared the 24,000-foot altitude where pressurization exerts maximum strain on an aircraft's skin. Like the Aloha plane, it fractured in a forward area, a part of the fuselage that Boeing calls Section 43. And there is one other, chilling similarity: Back in February of 1969, the Taiwanese plane had been the 151st Boeing 737 to roll off the assembly line. The Aloha airliner was No. 152.    &quot;Both accidents show that Section 43 is the Achilles' heel of the early-model 737s,&quot; contends Norman Jensen, a retired Los Angeles lawyer who was involved with suits by families of the Taiwan victims and has since been absorbed with studying possible design flaws in the early 737s.    &quot;There's nothing wrong with Section 43,&quot; counters Benjamin Cosgrove, vice president and general manager for engineering of the Boeing Co. division that designed the 737. The consecutive production-line numbers are &quot;pure coincidence,&quot; he says.    No matter who is right, the similarities in the Taiwan and Maui cases call into doubt an assumption many air travelers make about safety: that the system learns from the investigation of past disasters. Particularly worrisome is the evidence of a lack of international coordination, in a world where accident prevention depends much on the free flow of information about what causes planes to crash.    The two cases also underscore a peculiarity of the airline business, and possibly a dangerous one: When a design feature is called into question, the remedy usually isn't to recall and fix the plane but to let airlines rely on increased checking and maintenance if they choose.    The Federal Aviation Administration lately has made a project of studying the maintenance problems of the early 737s and the safety of aging aircraft in general. It has called together airlines and manufacturers for a conference starting tomorrow. But there's no indication that it or the National Transportation Safety Board ever acted on the government of Taiwan's recommendations following the crash there.    After that disaster, the FAA told owners of early 737s to either step up maintenance and corrosion checks or replace the airliners' metal skin. When Taiwan's government later came out with its report -- a copy of which was obtained by this newspaper -- it said more maintenance wasn't enough. The FAA should order skin-panel replacement, it said, partly because Boeing's design of the early 737s made it hard to spot rust-prone panels.    The U.S agencies haven't much to say about that report today. In fact, they apparently didn't even keep it on file. &quot;We've looked around for it here,&quot; says Stephan J. Corrie, a safety-board investigator. &quot;We're going to do all we can to make sure we have it&quot; before completion of the Aloha inquiry, still in its early stages.    G. Thomas McCarthy, who was head of the safety-board investigating team in Taiwan in 1981, is puzzled. &quot;They sure ought to have it on file,&quot; he says.    Boeing's Mr. Cosgrove has a theory about why the government can't find a copy. It didn't need to keep one, he says, because the U.S. investigators on the scene &quot;saw extensive corrosion that wasn't taken care of, and concluded no further action was required.&quot;    Whatever reason is eventually given for the Aloha mishap, Mr. Cosgrove says, the Taiwan 737 broke up because the airline had let its belly become so rusted. He says Far Eastern Air Transport, which flew the plane, repeatedly shipped fish in open containers, letting salt water slosh over the cargo hold. Far Eastern executives strongly deny that, saying fish were shipped only in stainless-steel containers that didn't leak. The Taiwan government report doesn't cite the shipping of fish.    Mr. Cosgrove acknowledges that in 1974, Boeing made major improvements in the structural design of 737s after the 291st plane came off the line. It strengthened some skin areas, and it replaced two methods of metal-bonding, the gluing process used in conjunction with rivets.    Boeing, like airlines and other plane-makers, denies that the age of a craft matters so long as it is well maintained. Nevertheless, the 737 is a clear instance of how current industry economics keep some planes flying beyond the manufacturers' original 20-year life expectancy for them.    First delivered in 1965, the stubby little 737s provide airlines with a twin-engine workhorse for their shortest hauls. Over 1,500 have been built, counting a handful of 737-100s, the longer 737-200 (which included Nos. 151 and 152) and the current 737-300. Nearly all still are flying.    Among early buyers were lines with island-hopping routes or with short, commuter-type turnarounds. Both the Aloha and the Far Eastern Air plane had seen California commuter duty. Island service subjects planes to a corrosive saltwater atmosphere. Short-hop service subjects them to the stress of many landings and pressurizations.    And there are more short hops now. Under deregulation, carriers have de-emphasized nonstop city-to-city flights for more-efficient &quot;hub-and-spoke&quot; patterns. At the same time, lower fuel prices have kept it economical to fly older planes like the 737 and given them unexpected longevity.    Maintenance, a big expense with any older plane, has been an issue from the beginning for 737s. Early on, airlines found that rust formed in joints where adhesives were used to bond metal airframe parts. The adhesives help take the pressure off the rivets. An early Boeing method used &quot;cold bonding&quot; adhesives where metal skin sections overlapped, and &quot;hot bonding&quot; to help join frame parts in the cargo hold. Both kinds of bonding required a lot of anti-corrosion attention, as the stress of planes' typically brutal schedules began to take a toll in rust-related cracking, especially along the airplanes' skin.    In 1974, after building 291 planes, Boeing introduced a redesigned 737 fuselage with stronger rivets doing the job of the former cold bonding. Parts made from a single piece of metal replaced most hot bonding in the cargo area. And the skin was made thicker in Section 43 -- the 15-foot slice of fuselage in front of the wing.    The 291 planes built with old designs were left in service. Boeing continued to issue service bulletins to their owners. A March 1978 bulletin, for instance, suggested additional &quot;skin&quot; inspections and repair in hot-bonded areas. Another in May 1981 proposed reinforcement of cargo-compartment walls. And the FAA issued an &quot;air-worthiness directive&quot; requiring certain inspections beginning July 1, 1981less than two months before the Taiwan plane disintegrated in flight.    With such guidance, Boeing's Mr. Cosgrove says, airlines haven't had problems continuing to operate the old planes safely. Many have reskinned their planes to incorporate Boeing-designed improvements, while others have adopted special maintenance procedures.    United Airlines has 46 of the original batch of 291 Boeing 737s -- including No. 150, the one that rolled off the assembly line ahead of the ill-fated Taiwan plane. They are entirely safe, it says. United replaced the belly skins on its older 737s after the Taiwan crash, a spokesman says, adding that they aren't operated near salt water and high humidity.    But a continuing Boeing study indicates that many airlines would rather spend money on more expensive repairs and parts replacement after rust develops than devote the resources to preventive maintenance. In Far Eastern Air's case, Boeing says it had actually provided the Taiwanese carrier with a kit for replacement of the corroded skin. &quot;Apparently, the replacement kit was still in their spare-parts inventory at the time of the accident&quot; 16 months later, according to a Boeing internal memo written after the 1981 crash. (Far Eastern executives say they are unable to confirm this.)    Far Eastern's 737 was hardly a geriatric case when it took off from Taipei for Kaohsiung, just across the island. At 12 years old, with 33,000 of the takeoff-pressurization-landing cycles that are a truer measure of age, it had seen far less service than the nearly 90,000 cycles of Aloha's plane.    But the Far Eastern jetliner, bought used from United in 1976, did have an extensive history of corrosion, cracking and pressurization problems apparently related to a rusted skin. In fact, its previous flight that day was aborted when the cabin didn't pressurize properly. A return to Taipei for some minor replacement parts seemed to have corrected things.    It hadn't. The corroded skin appears to have simply burst under the stress of cabin pressurization on its last flight. A study of the widely spread wreckage and of flight data suggested to investigators that disintegration began just after the plane reached 22,000 feet.    Among those on board were 53 Taiwanese, 19 Japanese and five Americans. The crash received press coverage, of course, some speculating about a bomb -- a theory dismissed early in the investigation. But within a few months two other disasters had overshadowed it: a Yugoslav MD-80 that went down in December, killing 180, and the dramatic plunge into the Potomac River the next month of a poorly de-iced Air Florida 737 that had just left Washington's National Airport.    In January 1982, the FAA ordered owners of old 737s to make regular checks for rust in the forward and aft cargo compartments. (Agency records show that by late 1983, Aloha had serviced No. 152 under this directive and found substantial corrosion and cracking that required numerous skin-panel replacements, mostly on the bottom.)    But the rusted areas often were hard to detect visually because they were deep within metal joints. The Taiwan report stopped short of directly criticizing either Far Eastern or Boeing, though it observed that anti-corrosion repairs by the airline were often patchwork. Maintenance hadn't addressed whether the patches could adequately fix the overall corroded and cracked state of the fuselage, it said.    Far Eastern's chairwoman, Linda Hwoo, says her airline still believes the crash reflected &quot;a design problem&quot; at Boeing. I.L. Shih, the airline's maintenance director, says the older 737s in its fleet now are being carefully maintained under FAA guidelines.    The Taiwan government's prime recommendation was that the FAA broaden its own directive to order airlines to replace the cargo panels, with the required assistance of Boeing, &quot;so as to improve the structural design, with which maintenance is difficult.&quot; Though the FAA didn't do that, the agency says it isn't sure today just what its initial reaction to the Taiwanese report was.    Some air-safety officials in Washington suggest a reason why the U.S. didn't keep the report on file. They say some foreign governments don't want U.S. agencies to keep such reports because the Freedom of Information Act makes them available to victims' lawyers.    Charles O. Miller, a former safety-board official who was a consultant to plaintiffs in the Taiwan crash litigation, says the greatest failing is the lack of a &quot;closed loop&quot; to make certain that airline-safety lessons like those of the Taiwan crash are followed not just by government or manufacturer warnings, but by actual correction of flaws.    Mr. Miller worries that the U.S. air-safety system has a short memory. After an accident, &quot;for a few months there's a lot of attention,&quot; he says. &quot;Then the system falls back on how we have a super record and there's nothing to worry about.&quot;    There's usually one exception to that rule, he adds: &quot;If there is an accident of the same kind -- and people didn't do enough to prevent a recurrence.&quot;    ---                         Who Is Flying                     The Early-Model 737s             Five or more airplanes, as of March 31      U.S.        United                                       46        Continental                                  40        Piedmont                                     21        American Air                                 18        America West                                  9        Pan American                                  8        Braniff                                       7        Aloha*                                        7      Foreign        VASP (Brazil)                                 9        Aer Lingus (Ireland)                          8        Aerolineas Argentinas                         8        All Nippon Airways                            6        Indian Airlines                               6        Britannia                                     5        Far Eastern Air (Taiwan)                      5        Canadian Airlines Intl.                       5      Crashed or otherwise      out of service                                 14   *Includes three planes leased out, three grounded and one damaged.
