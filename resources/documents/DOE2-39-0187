In the local approximation the range ofthe s-wave potential is of the size of the baryon wave function and thepotential has a strength of {approx_equal} 1 GeV. When the long rangetensor meson exchange potential is added to the short range quark rearrangementpotential we reproduce the Nanti N s-wave elastic and inelastic crosssections quite well. With the same potential s-wave branching ratiosinto various meson channels are calculated. They agree moderately wellwith experiment.</TEXT></DOC>
