<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-57-1006 </DOCNO><TEXT>The new short-lived complex cis-Cr(CO){sub 4}(C{sub 2}H{sub 4}){sub 2}is observed by time-resolved IR absorption spectrometry after pulsedlaser photolysis of gaseous mixtures of Cr(CO){sub 5}(C{sub 2}H{sub 4})and C{sub 2}H{sub 4}. No evidence is found for associated productionof trans-Cr(CO){sub 4}(C{sub 2}H{sub 4}){sub 2}. cis-Cr(CO){sub 4}(C{sub2}H{sub 4}){sub 2} reacts with CO to re-form Cr(CO){sub 5}(C{sub 2}H{sub4}) by dissociative substitution. From the dependence of the observedexponential decay constants on CO and C{sub 2}H{sub 4} pressures, theunimolecular decay constant of cis-Cr(CO){sub 4}(C{sub 2}H{sub 4}){sub2} is found to be (6 +/- 2) x 10{sup 4} s{sup -1} and the ratio of thebimolecular rate constants for the reaction of Cr(CO){sub 4}(c{sub 2}H{sub4}) with CO vs C{sub 2}H{sub 4} is found to be 0.7 +/- 0.2 favoring reactionwith C{sub 2}H{sub 4}.</TEXT></DOC>
