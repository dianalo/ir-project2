This would, of course, depend on the nature of the information atrisk - but the point is that supposedly private information can be accessedby outsiders as easily as this, and, according to Dave Perras, seniorconsultant at Commslogic Ltd, the majority of information technology usersstill cling on to the irrational and dangerous belief that computers andassociated data processing peripherals are somehow in the private domain, andare therefore as safe from intrusion as a whispered conversation.andM;DismayandM;Perras, who was speaking at a briefing session as part of the Department ofTrade's three year IT Security Awareness campaign co-ordinated by theNational Computing Centre, explained that every electronic processing deviceemits its own unmistakable electromagnetic signal that can be detected andinterpreted by any unauthorised person using simple receiving equipment,usually within a hundred yards or so, but in certain conditions over more amile.andP;  Some years ago, the Dutch scientist Dr Van Eck amused himself at anexhibition by taking his receiving equipment and a display screen down theaisle where various suppliers of computer security devices were exhibiting:to the understandable dismay of the exhibitors, the result was that as hepassed from stand to stand, their security software demonstration programsappeared one by one on his screen - regardless of whether data encryption wasused or not.andP;  Since then, a few of the organisations most at risk - mostnotably NATO and some large financial institutions - have taken steps toprevent such detection, known as passive electromagnetic eavesdropping.andP;  NATOhas developed a set of specifications called Tempest, which effectively makesthis form of eavesdropping impossible by restricting the extent ofelectromagnetic emanance down to as little as 2mm; all NATO equipment mustconform to these specifications, but the cost of producing equipment to meetthe Tempest requirements is too large at the moment for any significantimpact in the civilian sphere.andP;  One financial institution was sufficientlymoved to consider constructing a vast aluminium shell over its entirepremises, but was finally advised simply to reconsider the way it usedinformation technology in the first place.andP;  -andM;By Mark JohnandM;The other problem is that passive electromagnetic eavesdropping is notillegal - simply because it uses airwaves that are necessarily in the publicdomain, and therefore does not constitute a breach of privacy in the same waythat, for example, raiding a filing cabinet does - and even if it were madeillegal, detecting eavesdroppers would be virtually impossible.andP;  As thingsstand at the moment, Ferras concludes that for firms whose informationrepresents a valuable, and therefore risky asset, the only sensible solutionis to re-evaluate their use of technology from the bottom up - in otherwords, to accept that using computers, networks, modems and other devices isin fact as private as shouting from the rooftops, and until there is atechnological solution - such as a less stringent but still effective versionof the Tempest specifications - that will bring the use of technology intothe private domain, they are well-advised to return to more traditionalmethods to communicate and process particularly sensitive information.andP;  Thepossibility of electromagnetic emanance eavesdropping could threaten tochange the role of information technology in a profound way - but Ferrasadmits that trying to get users interested in the subject is rather likesaying to a crowd, &quot;there is an odourless gas that is poisoning you now -please panic!&quot;andM;Computer viruses on the other hand have more obvious effects and the factthat, as the next speaker Dr Jan Hruska of Sophos Ltd explained, theseeffects can range from a harmless joke to the complete destruction of alldata being processed, means that organisations are more inclined to takesteps to eradicate them - not least because there has been a significant risein the number of viruses reported.andP;  For anyone intent on protectingthemselves from the effects of computer viruses and similar foreign bodies,Hruska argued that it is important to be able to distinguish the differentstrains.andP;  A &quot;trojan horse&quot;, for instance, is not a virus: it is simply apiece of code that performs something - often harmful - that is not statedwithin its specification; for example a release of a data compression packagestated that it would compress data to occupy 40% of the disk space itrequired originally - in fact, it compressed the data to 0% of its originalsize, resulting in the total loss of that data.andM;Logic bombandM;A &quot;logic bomb&quot; is a piece of code that is triggered off if a set ofconditions are fulfilled - quite often this is a time trigger - and thenthere are viruses proper, which are often written with elements such astrojan horses and logic bombs included.andP;  Viruses are distinguished by theability to replicate themselves from machine to machine, network to network;by the existence of side-effects, and by a disguise that allows them to bepassed from machine to machine without detection.andP;  Examples of virusesinclude the &quot;Italian&quot;, which is memory resident and time-triggered, andcauses a bouncing ball to appear on the screen; the &quot;New Zealand&quot; or&quot;Stoned&quot;, which, one time in every eight that the machine is re-booted, willdisplay the message, &quot;Your PC is stoned!&quot;; &quot;Cascade&quot;, which according toHruska accounts for 35% of known UK computer infections - between October 1and December 31 of any year, Cascade causes the characters displayed on aninfected machine to drop to the bottom of the screen; other viruses, such asthe &quot;Jerusalem&quot; or &quot;PLO&quot;, have the more serious consequences of file deletionand system slow-down.andP;  Sophos provides handbooks, video training courses andconsultancy on how to deal with viruses, but Hruska says that for those thatare uninfected and wish to remain so, the message can be summed up in oneline: Don't use software of doubtful origin.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
