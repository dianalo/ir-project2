By defeating a pair of amendments to end or delayproduction of additional radar-eluding B-2s, the Senate setthe stage for a historic test of wills with the House overthe kind of military forces the U.S. needs to cope withSoviet nuclear threats and Third World crises in the late1990s and beyond. The margin of victory was eight votes orfewer in both instances.</LP><TEXT>   In spite of the fact that saving the B-2 remains PresidentBush's highest military priority, the House is almost certainto reject additional purchases of the bat-shaped bomber whenit approves its version of the defense authorization bill inSeptember.   Reflecting sharp erosion of bipartisan support even in theSenate, lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to withhold any moreproduction funds until the Air Force and Northrop Corp., theprime contractor on the B-2, present convincing new testresults showing that its performance in the air has matchedits billing.   &quot;This horse is heavy enough already,&quot; said Sen. Sam Nunn(D., Ga.), adding that significant further delays will makeit &quot;very, very difficult to ever sell it to the Americanpeople.&quot;   Still, yesterday's dramatic series of votes was a victoryfor both President Bush and Sen. Nunn, chairman of the ArmedServices Committee. Sen. Nunn staked his reputation as theSenate's leading voice on defense matters on the outcome ofthe B-2 battle. Last year, only 29 senators voted to cut offB-2 production. This time, 43 senators voted to haltpurchases and begin closing down the assembly line, while 56opposed the amendment.   Acknowledging that &quot;the popular decision in the UnitedStates today {would be} to cancel the B-2,&quot; Sen. James Exon(D., Neb.), another outspoken supporter, urged the Senate tosalvage the &quot;quantum leap forward&quot; in technology.   The lengthy debate originally was expected to focus onarms-control issues, the B-2s huge price of more than $850million a plane, and disputes about Soviet militarycapabilities and intentions. Instead, Iraq's bloody invasionof Kuwait altered the tone of the entire debate. Supportersof the B-2, who clearly had been on the defensive before,gained momentum and fresh ammunition by attacking Iraq'smoves and pointing out the B-2's capabilities to respond tosuch an emergency.   The unexpected Iraqi attack &quot;reminded {lawmakers} there isa lot of mischief in the world,&quot; Senate Minority LeaderRobert Dole (R., Kan.) said. &quot;We ought to err on the side ofbeing prepared.&quot;   Almost every lawmaker who joined in the debate -- fromstaunch supporters of the B-2 to newly converted opponentssuch as Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio) -- tried to capitalize onthe Middle Eastern development to help make their case. Sen.Glenn, a former astronaut and advocate of new aviationtechnology, took the Senate floor to announce that afterweeks of &quot;agonizing&quot; he concluded that the B-2 would siphonoff badly needed funds from conventional weapons and militarypersonnel accounts. The Air Force, he said, simply hasn't&quot;been willing to address that {issue} head on,&quot; adding thatthe B-2 &quot;isn't what we need to go against the situation inthe Persian Gulf.&quot;   All told, the Senate approved almost $2 billion forprocurement of two more B-2 bombers and at least that muchfor continued research and testing during the fiscal yearstarting Oct. 1. The Pentagon has spent about $27 billion for15 planes already authorized or currently being built. Thetotal price is expected to be well over $65 billion if thefleet of 75 B-2s proposed by the White House is built. Barelya few months ago, the Pentagon insisted it needed 132 of theplanes to fulfill its nuclear-deterrent mission.   In his spirited defense of the plane, Sen. Nunn arguedthat terminating production would send U.S. arms-controlnegotiators &quot;back to the drawing board&quot; and leave the U.S.vulnerable to continued improvements in the Soviet's nucleararsenal. &quot;All of us are suffering from sticker shock&quot; withthe B-2, he acknowledged. But if Soviet advances eventuallyforce the U.S. to begin investing in a new network ofsuper-sophisticated air defenses, he said, &quot;it will make the. . . B-2 look like the biggest bargain we ever killed.&quot;   The anti-B-2 amendment that garnered the mostvotes-introduced by Sens. William Cohen (R., Maine) andPatrick Leahy (D., Vt.) -- sought to withhold all newproduction money until at least 1992, pending the outcome offlight tests. &quot;The biggest stealth characteristic of thisplane has been its mission,&quot; Sen. Leahy asserted, adding:&quot;Unfortunately, it's not stealth dollars.&quot; The amendmentfailed on a 53-45 vote.   B-2 supporters insisted that a one-year disruption inproduction could be tantamount to killing the entire program,by adding $4.7 billion to the already skyrocketing cost ofthe B-2 and prompting layoffs of some assembly-line workers.   In a speech to the Aspen Institute in Colorado, PresidentBush echoed that sentiment. &quot;To maintain clear and confidentstrategic deterrence into the next century, we need the B-2.. . . further delay will only increase cost.&quot; The presidentalso urged Congress to fund continued development of theMidgetman and mobile MX missiles.   Working late into the evening, the Senate also defeated anamendment that would bar construction of an airbase inCrotone, Italy.</TEXT></DOC>
