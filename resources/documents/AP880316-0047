(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An asteroid collision with Earth mayhave released enough gas to heat the planet 65 million years ago,causing gradual extinction of dinosaurs and other species bydestroying their food, researchers say.   The study drew guarded praise from a critic of the theory,because the findings attempt to explain why only certain creaturesbecame extinct and why the extinctions were gradual, not sudden.   The asteroid impact theory differs from ones in which scientistssaid such a collision caused mass extinction by kicking up enoughdust to block sunlight, plunging the planet into a freezingdarkness that killed plants, a source of food.   California Institute of Technology planetary scientist JohnO'Keefe and geophysicist Thomas Ahrens reached their conclusion byanalyzing experiments in which Ahrens and geophysicist ManfredLange shot steel bullets into rocks at 4,500 mph.   Based on the amount of carbon dioxide released by the shatteredrocks, the scientists calculated that a 6-mile-diameter asteroidhitting limestone or other carbon-rich rocks on Earth would havereleased enough carbon dioxide to increase the amount of the gas inthe atmosphere two to five times.   Such an increase in the gas, which traps solar heat like glassin a greenhouse, could have caused a ``greenhouse effect'' thatwarmed the planet by 9 to 36 degrees Fahrenheit for 10,000 yearsafter the asteroid struck, Ahrens said Tuesday.   ``The leafy plants which dinosaurs ate were selectivelydestroyed'' by the heat while other plants survived, Ahrens said.``So there was probably (increased) competition for available food,and eventually food supplies declined to a point where differentspecies, including the dinosaurs, became extinct in aless-than-sudden manner.''   Fossils show dinosaurs and other creatures became extinctgradually, while many species survived. Many biologists andpaleontologists argue the mass extinction 65 million years ago wascaused by gradual climate change, not an asteroid or other suddencatastrophe.   William Clemens, paleontology chairman at the University ofCalifornia, Berkeley, and a leading critic of asteroid theories,said he was skeptical of the O'Keefe-Ahrens theory because thedinosaurs started to die earlier than 65 million years ago.   But he called their study ``clearly a positive step'' because itis consistent with gradual, selective extinction.   O'Keefe will present the study Thursday in Houston at the 19thLunar and Planetary Science Conference.   Scientists debating the dinosaurs' extinction fall into two maincamps: those who blame gradual climate change and those who blamecatastrophe. Catastrophe theorists disagree on whether an asteroidor gigantic volcanic eruption was to blame.   Geophysicist Charles Officer of Dartmouth College said hebelieves the O'Keefe-Ahrens theory does not have merit becausegeologic evidence supports the theory that volcanoes spewed enoughash skyward to block sunlight and cause mass extinction.   Geochemist Frank Kyte, of the University of California, LosAngeles, disagreed, saying the theory that the asteroid triggeredgreenhouse warming of the atmosphere is probably sound.   While other scientists previously suggested the greenhouseeffect caused the extinctions, they said the carbon dioxide wasgenerated by volcanoes, changes in ocean circulation, or acid rainthat dissolved carbon-rich rocks.   It is important to learn what killed the dinosaurs because ``itbehooves us to find out if we're just sort of sitting here awaitinganother (asteroid) impact to seal our doom, or if some of thethings we're doing to the environment might ... lead to theextinction of many species,'' Clemens said.   Scientists believe rising levels of carbon dixoide and othergreenhouse gases will warm Earth 3 to 5 degrees by the year 2050,possibly causing crop-threatening droughts and partly melting polarice caps to raise sea levels and threaten coastal cities.   Ahrens said an asteroid impact not only may have triggeredgreenhouse heating, but possibly caused chemical reactions thatformed intense acid rain, which either killed many creaturesdirectly or wiped out their food plants. Clemens, however, wonderedhow birds and other surviving species could have hidden from thecorrosive downpour.</TEXT></DOC>
