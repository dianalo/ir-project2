This paper is concerned with the transformationof residuals into ambient pollution, a subject that has received verylittle attention in the economics literature. It is showed how economictheory can be used to develop an aggregate relationship between residualsgeneration and ambient pollution in very much the same way that a productionfunction summarizes engineering relationships of production. Restrictionson the functional form of such a pollution possibility frontier are developed.The frontier is estimated for the Petrified Forest region of Arizona.</TEXT></DOC>
