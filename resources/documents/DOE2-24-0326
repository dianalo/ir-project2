A constant ratio between the thermal far-infraredradiation and non-thermal radio emission is a universal property of starformation in spiral galaxies. The current rate of star formation in starburstgalaxies is found to be 3-20 times larger than in the Milky Way. Galaxieswith the higher far-infrared luminosities and warmer dust, have the largermass fractions of molecular to atomic interstellar gas, and in some instances,striking deficiencies of neutral hydrogen are found. A statistical blueshiftof the optical systemic velocities relative to the radio systemic velocities,may be due to an outward motion of the optical line-emitting gas. Fromthe high rates of star formation, and from the short times required forthe depletion of the interstellar gas, we conclude that the most luminousinfrared galaxies represent a brief but important phase in the evolutionof some galaxies, when two galaxies merge changing substantially theiroverall properties.</TEXT></DOC>
