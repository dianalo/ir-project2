But Prof. Tribe goes further. For this occasion only, he becomes a strict constructionist to limit federal power -- so strict, in fact, that he rigidly construes constitutional words that aren't even there.    He says that the governor's lawsuit to block use of National Guard members in Central America raised a conflict between the Constitution's militia provisions and what Mr. Tribe calls &quot;the clauses empowering the federal government to raise and control regular armies.&quot; But nowhere do those clauses contain his limiting word &quot;regular,&quot; and the broad federal authority they confer has not been confined to regular armies for 200 years. Federal power applies of course to the reserve components of the Army, including federal National Guard members, no less than to persons on active duty.    What the court in Massachusetts held -- and the crucial point Mr. Tribe does not mention -- is that members of the Massachusetts National Guard are at the same time members of a separate organization, the National Guard of the United States (which pays for their training), and as such are subject to federal orders as federal, not state, militia. Although they serve part time, they are just as much members of the federal armed forces as any second lieutenant whose regular Army bars were pinned on this spring at West Point.    Nor were the orders that they train for two weeks in Central America some sort of &quot;evasion&quot; of &quot;democratic principles.&quot; The Army has sensibly sent its National Guard members abroad for training for many years. Air National Guard pilots fly serious missions every weekend around the world. Without their trained availability for service overseas, we would need far larger active armed forces, an expensive alternative that many might see as an even greater threat to &quot;democratic principles.&quot;    The court did not simply, as Prof. Tribe implies, deny this governor a particular form of relief; it told him that what it called his &quot;rather extraordinary&quot; constitutional theory was flat wrong. Military and foreign policy have never been thought the province of state governors, certainly not since the passing of John C. Calhoun. As the court pointed out, a string of decisions going back to World War I, including one last year against Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota in a virtually identical lawsuit, had plainly settled the point Gov. Dukakis sought to revive.    Litigation can be diverting and, as Prof. Tribe suggests, a few rare cases like Marbury v. Madison can be instructive. But one Marbury v. Madison per generation is all that is required.    John G. Kester   Attorney   Washington   ---   Is Prof. Tribe coming round? To a principled view of constitutional jurisprudence, that is.    In his letter, he appears to realize that there are certain &quot;democratic principles that animated the Framers' creation of a citizen army.&quot; It is truly startling that he should acknowledge, at long last, that the Constitution states a core value, which the framers intended to enshrine and protect.    That major premise is that the Constitution establishes a democratic framework, which, of course, implies the legitimacy of a democratic majority. While courts must define the proper spheres of democratic authority and individual liberty, in doing so they must always recognize the constitutional bias in favor of the freedom of the democratic majority.    If now Prof. Tribe would only recognize that these same &quot;democratic principles&quot; also &quot;animate&quot; the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, we might expect to see from him a constitutional point of view that is founded on intellectual integrity instead of on unprincipled social theory.
