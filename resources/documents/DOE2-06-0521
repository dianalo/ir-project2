The problem of the energy loss incurredby heavy ions at the foil is discussed. Intensity decay curves includingthe region around the foil are analysed using VNET, a multiexponentialfitting routine which includes the instrumental window function. Theseanalyses are found to give results virtually identical with those obtainedusing normal curve-fitting of the data excluding the foil region in ourcase, where the window region only extends over one or two primary lifetimes.A comparison of the experimental and theoretical f-values trends forthe resonance transitions of the ions belonging to the gold and mercuryisoelectronic sequences shows that the model potential used by Migdalekand Baylis in 1985 to allow for valence-core correlation gives good agreementwith observation for the mercury sequence, whereas their similar calculationin 1979 for the gold sequence appears to give f-values lower than thosefound by experiment for Tl III and Pb IV.</TEXT></DOC>
