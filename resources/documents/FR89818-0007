The changes are intended to increasethe use of delegations, to codify certain interpretations of the rule,to add conditions of approval, and to interpretations of the rule, to addconditions of approval, and to make technical revisions in the rule. Inaddition, the final rule modifies the bases for supervisory objection toapproval of a subordinated debt application now found at 12 CFR 563.8-1(b)(2)by authorizing the Office of Regulatory Activities of the Federal HomeLoan Bank System (``Office of Regulatory Activities'') to develop guidelinesin consultation with the Office of District Banks and the Office of GeneralCounsel and to specify the bases for supervisory objection to the issuanceof subordinated debt (the ``Guidelines''). The Guidelines developed bythe Office of Regulatory Activities will be issued before the effectivedate of this final rule. The Board expects to limit the imposition of non-standardconditions in subordinated debt approvals. Accordingly, the Board is deletingcertain of the bases for supervisory objection currently specified in theregulation, some of which have become obsolete, and the Office of RegulatoryActivities will issue shortly Guidelines that specify supervisory basesfor objection to subordinated debt applications. The Guidelines will implementthe general standards contained in the final regulation. Further, the rule now includes a set of standard conditions that will beapplicable to approvals of applications to include subordinated debt inregulatory capital. Except in highly unusual circumstances or where supervisoryobjections are raised based on the Guidelines in effect at that time, theBoard expects that such standard conditions will be the only conditionsimposed by the Board or its delegates in the approval of subordinated debtapplications.Finally, the final rule gives the Principal Supervisory Agents (``PSAs'')authority to deny as well as to approve subordinated debt applications.Coupled with this new authority, the regulation includes an appeal processdesigned to provide ``final agency action.'' The Board is aware that under the pending Financial Institutions Reform,Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, inclusion of subordinated debt asa form of regulatory capital may become more limited than is the case today.Accordingly, to the extent that inclusion of subordinated debt as a formof regulatory capital is restricted, the revised regulatory provisionswill apply to only that portion of an insured institution's subordinateddebt that would be permitted to be treated as regulatory capital and tothe extent such subordinated debt can be included in regulatory capitalunder the new legislation and new regulations issued pursuant thereto.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> September 18, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Paul D.

No. 88-1569, 54 FR 1379 (January 13, 1989). TheBoard invited comments on the proposed changes to the regulation at thetime the proposed changes were issued. The comment period expired on March15, 1989. The Board has carefully studied the comments and the issues raised by thecommentators in determining whether and in what manner to proceed in changingthe subordinated debt regulation. As a result, while major elements ofthe final rule are substantially the same as the language proposed, someprovisions have been changed in response to comments. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background </ITAG>Since 1973, the Board, as operating head of the FSLIC, has permitted insuredinstitutions to include as part of their regulatory capital the proceedsof the sale of subordinated debt securities issued pursuant to 12 CFR 563.8-1.Initially, insured institutions were permitted to include as regulatorycapital the principal amount of such debt securities up to a limit of 20percent of their capital. In 1982, the Board amended its regulations toallow insured institutions to include the full amount of the proceeds ofthe sale of subordinated debt securities having a remaining maturity inexcess of one year as part of their capital and statutory reserve.\1\<NOTE/> On April 18, 1985, the Board further amended its regulationsto require that the amount of qualifying subordinated debt with a remainingperiod to maturity of less than seven years that may be included as regulatorycapital must be reduced annually pursuant to an amortization schedule setforth in andSection; 561.13.\2\<NOTE/> The principal rationale underlying the Board's decision toallow the inclusion in regulatory capital of the proceeds of the sale ofsubordinated debt securities issued under 12 CFR 563.8-1 is that subordinateddebt meeting the requirements of the regulation has some of the characteristicsof other types of permanent capital and reduces the risks to the FSLIC.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ See Resolution No. 82-581 (August 26, 1982). Under GenerallyAccepted Accounting Principles (``GAAP''), subordinated debt is treatedas a liability. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ See Resolution No. 85-292, 50 FR 20550 (May 17, 1985).On August 10, 1987, the President signed into law the Competitive EqualityBanking Act of 1987 (``CEBA''), Pub. L. 100-86, 101 Stat. 552. The CEBAaddresses a number of important issues relating specifically to the thriftindustry, including recapitalization of the FSLIC, emergency acquisitionsof troubled thrift institutions, and potential areas for improvement inthe examination and supervisory process. As required by CEBA, the Boardon October 9, 1987, promulgated Applications Processing Guidelines as partof 12 CFR 571.12. The present regulatory proposal seeks to promote moreefficient processing of subordinated debt applications, consistent withthe objectives of CEBA and the requirements of the Applications ProcessingGuidelines, and also reflects an additional four years of experience withthe subordinated debt regulation since the regulation was last amended.The Board is aware, however, that under the pending Financial InstitutionsReform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, inclusion of subordinateddebt may be more limited than is the case today. Thus, the revised regulationswill apply to only that portion of an insured institution's subordinateddebt that is permitted to be treated as regulatory capital under the newlegislation and new regulations issued thereunder. The rule changes herein are effective September 18, 1989, and are applicableto subordinated debt applications in process but not yet deemed completeas well as those filed after the effective date of this rule. The Board has followed the notice and comment procedure pursuant to 5 U.S.C.553(b) and 12 CFR 508.11 by publishing the proposed rules for notice andcomment. <T3>See</T3> 54 FR 1379, January 13, 1989. The Board has determined thatthe 30-day delay of effective date pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d) and 12 CFR508.14 is appropriate in this instance. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Comments and Discussion of the Rule </ITAG>The Board received two letters of comment on the Board's rule proposal_onefrom an insured institution and one from a thrift industry trade association.The letters were generally supportive of the rule proposal. The followingparagraphs address the concerns raised in those letters as well as furtherinsights of the Board and its staff. 1. Issuance of Guidelines One commentator objected to authorizing the Office of Regulatory Activitiesto issue Guidelines. While the Board has considered this objection, theBoard is of the opinion that, on balance, the industry and the agency arebetter served by having guidelines that can be changed as opposed to havingno guidelines and that up-to-date specific guidelines are preferable toout-of-date vague regulations.Guidelines will provide a mechanism to clarify and keep current the basesfor supervisory objection to applications to include subordinated debtin regulatory capital of insured institutions. The use of uniform Guidelinesalso should increase efficiency in approving applications to include subordinateddebt issues as part of regulatory capital.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ In its release No. 87-1298 dated December 22, 1987, theBoard similarly authorized the Office of Regulatory Activities to developguidelines for administering the Board's new rule providing for individualminimum capital requirements. See 12 CFR 563.14. The Office of Regulatory Activities will prepare such Guidelines in consultationwith the Board's Office of District Banks and the Board's Office of GeneralCounsel. These Guidelines will be published in the near future before theeffective date of this rule. In keeping with the Board's desire to haveuniform national supervisory policies, the Office of Regulatory Activities,under the Board's oversight, will administer and maintain the Guidelineson an on-going basis. The format of Guidelines will allow for increasedflexibility in future modifications, as needed. The Guidelines are designedto identify supervisory factors that PSAs may use in considering whetherto approve or deny an application. Some of the current bases for supervisoryobjections now set forth at 12 CFR 563.8-1(b)(2) are obsolete and havebeen revised and/or expanded into Guidelines. The Guidelines are illustrativebut not exclusive bases for supervisory objection to subordinated debtapplications. The Office of Regulatory Activities in consultation withthe Office of District banks and the Office of General Counsel will beable in the future to change the Guidelines as circumstances warrant, withoutthe necessity for notice and comment rulemaking.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Such Guidelines will not form the basis for assertionsof violations of statutes and regulations, but may be part of a findingthat an institution is engaged in unsafe or unsound practices. 2. Defaultsand Other Events Providing for Mandatory Prepayment of Principal One of the factors considered in the processing of a subordinated debtapplication is whether the issuance of the subordinated debt securitiesand any related transactions will result in a transfer of risk from theFSLIC to parties other than insured institutions. See 12 CFR 563.8-1(b)(3).The Board, on the basis of this provision, has objected to the inclusionin subordinated debt instruments of terms that provide for mandatory redemptionof the debt or for events of default (which could give rise to accelerationof maturity of the principal of the debt) based on changes in control ofthe obligor (known in anti-takeover parlance as a ``poisoned put''), ora failure of the obligor to comply with maintenance and operating covenantsthat were believed to be unreasonable in the circumstances. In this connection,the Board notes that one of the bases for permitting an insured institutionto include an amount equal to the proceeds of the sale of subordinateddebt securities in its regulatory capital is that the issuance of suchsecurities represents a relatively long term commitment of capital to theinsured institution. For this reason, the Board has not approved subordinateddebt applications where the subordinated debt securities (or the indenturespursuant to which they were proposed to be issued) included provisionsthat might unduly accelerate payment of the debt prior to scheduled maturities,because such provisions could subject the FSLIC to a significant risk ofprecipitous decline in an institution's regulatory capital. The Board recognizes,however, that to effect a successful offering of debt securities, the securities,or the indentures pursuant to which they are issued, must include provisionsthat investors have come to accept as customary in offerings of such type,to the extent such provisions can be included without frustrating the purposeof the subordinated debt regulation. Thus, although provisions that requireacceleration of maturity (through declaration, mandatory prepayments, orotherwise) following a change of control of the obligor will continue tobe objectionable, the Board will not object to subordinated debt applicationssolely because the terms of the securities (or related indentures) includeevents of default such as failure to make timely payment of interest andprincipal, failure to comply with reasonable and customary financial maintenanceand operating covenants, and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency,receivership, and similar events. The final rule has been revised appropriatelyto add clarifying language to 12 CFR 563.8-1(b)(3) to address these considerations.3. Voluntary Prepayments The subordinated debt regulation provides that payment of principal maynot be accelerated without approval of the FSLIC, if, after giving effectto such accelerated payment, the insured institution obligor would failto meet its regulatory capital requirement. 12 CFR 563.8-1(d)(1)(iv). TheBoard has consistently taken the position that if any mandatory prepayment(such as payment upon acceleration of maturity following an event of default)is restricted to this extent, <T3>a fortiori, </T3>any voluntary prepayment should be similarly restricted.Further, an institution obviously should not be permitted to make suchpayments if the institution is already failing to meet its regulatory capitalrequirements. 12 CFR 563.8-1(d)(1)(iv) now reflects these long-standinginterpretive positions.4. Issuance of Subordinated Debt Securities Pursuant to an Indenture While the Board proposed for comment the proposition that all insured institutionsbe subject to requirements based upon standards of the Trust IndentureAct of 1939, as amended, (``TIA'') 15 U.S.C. 77aaa-77bbbb, the Board hasdecided to take a more limited approach. The Board considers the benefitsof the use of an indenture in certain circumstances to be beneficial tothe discipline of the institution and for the institution in dealing withits debt holders. Thus the Board has determined to require an issuer toissue its subordinated debt securities pursuant to an indenture in certaincircumstances. Such an indenture must provide for the appointment of atrustee other than the obligor or an affiliate of the obligor and for thecollective enforcement of the rights and remedies of the security holders,if the aggregate amount of debt securities ``publicly offered'' (salesin a non-public offering as defined in 12 CFR 563g.4 are excluded) andsold by a single obligor in any consecutive twelve month period exceeds$2,000,000 and/or exceeds $5,000,000 in any consecutive thirty-six monthperiod. One commentator suggested that the proposed trust indenture requirementshould ``grandfather'' any subordinated offerings already approved by theBoard. The Board has followed that suggestion. The indenture requirementwill be applicable to subordinated debt applications in process but notyet deemed complete as well as those applications filed after the effectivedate of the rule. Another commentator objected to the requirement that some subordinateddebt offerings would be required to use an indenture. That commentatoropposed the requirement of using an indenture because of the added costto an insured institution for the trust indenture and the related costsof the trustee's expenses over the life of the obligations.\5\<NOTE/> The Board has considered the objections of this commentator,but has determined to adopt the limited requirement outlined above.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The Board notes that both bank holding companies and savingsand loan holding companies would have to comply with all of the requirementsof the TIA. Any related exemptions to the TIA would apply only to any debtsecurities issued by their subsidiary insured institutions and not to theholding company itself. The TIA, which by its terms is inapplicable to securities issued by insuredinstitutions, and the Rules and Regulations under the TIA provide, generally,that any debt securities offered and sold to the public by a single obligorin an amount in excess of $2,000,000 in any consecutive twelve month periodmust be issued pursuant to an indenture and that debt securities that arepublicly offered and sold by the same obligor in an amount exceeding $5,000,000in any consecutive thirty-sixty month period must be issued pursuant toan indenture that is ``qualified'' under the TIA. See 17 CFR 260.4(a)(1)and 260.4(a)(2). Although the TIA specifies in considerable detail theprovisions that must be included in a qualified indenture (which requiredprovisions relate principally to the qualifications, duties and powersof the trustee, the duties of the obligor, and the rights   of the holdersof the debt securities), neither the TIA nor the rules promulgated thereunderset forth any requirements with respect to the provisions of a non-qualifiedindenture. The Securities and Exchange Commission, however, for many yearshas taken the position that any indenture must, at a minimum, provide forthe appointment of a trustee other than the obligor or an affiliate ofthe obligor and provide some reasonable procedures for the collective enforcementof the rights of the holders of the debt securities. The Board's experience has been that most publicly offered issues of subordinateddebt securities of any significant size by insured institutions are offeredand sold through underwriters, and in such cases the securities are invariablyissued pursuant to an indenture that includes all or substantially allof the provisions that would be required to be included in an indenturequalified under the TIA. The use of an indenture in connection with theissuance of subordinated debt securities can be beneficial, since certainof the terms included in such an indenture may provide a framework of financialdiscipline for the obligor, which in some cases may further the interestsof the Board and the FSLIC. Further, it may be more efficient and workablefor the insured institution obligor to deal with a trustee (some actionsmay be subject to ratification by the holders of a specified majority inprincipal amount of the debt securities) if the debtor should desire toamend the terms of the securities or to obtain a waiver of any convenantsprovided therein, or in the related indenture, rather than to contend witha large number of individual security holders. The Board is aware thatthe requirement to use an indenture will result in additional expense tocertain issuing institutions but has concluded that the additional expenseis warranted by the benefit received. 5. Reports One commentator noted that GAAP requires an institution to include as abalance sheet liability the entire amount of subordinated debt issued includingany capitalized expenses and therefore this commentator argues that theBoard should allow insured institutions to include as regulatory capitalall subordinated debt, including the portion of the subordinated debt offsetby the expenses of the debt offering. The Board agrees that GAAP requiresthe entire debt to be listed on the liability side of the balance sheet.However, under GAAP, no portion of debt is included as capital. The purposeof the Board's subordinated debt regulation is to specify the portion ofsubordinated debt the Board is willing to count as ``capital'' for regulatorypurposes. Since capital is designed to provide protection for the FSLICand since only net proceeds provide that protection, the Board is willingto give such credit for only the actual net amount of moneys raised bythe issuer that are available for the insured institution's use and thatmeet the other requirements of 12 CFR 563.13 for inclusion as regulatorycapital. Thus this aspect of the proposed regulation has not been changed.To clarify this point, however, the Board has added the additional sentenceto the requirement in 12 CFR 563.8-1(h) that an insured institution mustfile a report with the Board 30 days after completion of the sale of subordinateddebt securities. This sentence clarifies that the amount to be includedin regulatory capital is an amount net of all expenses incurred in connectionwith the sale of the subordinated debt securities. This revised provisionrequires the issuing institution to specify the actual amount of the proceedsfrom the sale of the subordinated debt securities that the insured institutioninitially intends to include in its regulatory capital.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ On an ongoing basis, the insured institution must calculatethe amount of subordinated debt including any unacreted premiums or unamortizeddiscounts as required by GAAP. This concept means essentially that as thecapitalized expenses of the debt offering are amortized over the life ofthe obligations, the net amount of subordinated debt to be counted as capitalwill increase. Similarly, as any premium on the sale of the debt is amortizedover the life of the obligations, the net amount of subordinated debt thatwill be counted as capital will decrease. 6. Delegations of Authority Currently, PSAs are authorized to approve applications filed pursuant to12 CFR 563.8-1 unless such applications involve significant issues of lawor policy upon which the Board has not taken a formal position, or unlessan offering circular will be required in connection with the public offeringand sale of the securities that are the subject of any such application.The revised regulation eliminates the requirement that an application beforwarded to Washington solely because an offering circular is involvedand gives the PSAs authority to deny applications as well as to approvethem, subject to an appeal process. Applicants must be aware, however,that   even though the PSA under the proposed regulatory amendments couldapprove a subordinated debt application where securities are to be soldpursuant to an offering circular even if such offering circular has notyet been declared effective, PSA approval would be conditioned upon theoffering circular in the form declared effective not disclosing any materialadverse information concerning the applicant's business, operations, prospects,or financial condition not disclosed in the latest form of offering circularfiled as an exhibit to the subordinated debt application.At the present time, the Board is concerned about so-called ``retail''sales of subordinated debt securities by institutions on their own premises.Such sales present a variety of legal and policy concerns. Accordingly,where such sales of subordinated debt are proposed to be made by the institutionitself in its offices or those of an affiliate, those applications willbe carefully reviewed consistent with the guidance provided by the Officeof Regulatory Activities (<T3>see, </T3>Thrift Bulletin 23, dated April 13, 1989) and the Corporateand Securities Division, Office of General Counsel. If such applicationfails to meet such standards, the PSA should deem the application to involvesignificant issues of law and policy and refer the application to WashingtonDC to be considered by the Board. The revised regulation otherwise further delegates authority to approveor deny requests for extensions of time requested pursuant to 12 CFR 563.8-1(g)to whomever is authorized to approve an application. Such extensions oftime could be granted for a period of time of up to six months. All suchextensions of time taken together may not exceed one year from the dateof the original approval of the subordinated debt application. 7. Appeals The Board has considered an additional idea that the ``appeal process''should include the right to appeal any non-standard conditions includedin the approval of a subordinated debt application by the PSA pursuantto their newly delegated authority. While the Board does not expect thePSAs to be including non-standard conditions in their approvals of subordinateddebt applications, the Board thinks that the idea is appropriate and hasrevised the final rule accordingly. In connection with the delegation of authority to the PSA's to deny applicationsunder 12 CFR 563.8-1, the Board is adopting an appeal process for the furtherconsideration of denials of applications by the PSAs in the form originallyproposed. In essence, the appeal process requires any applicant wishingto appeal a determination of the PSA to file with the Office of DistrictBanks, within 30 days of the PSA's determination, a written request forreview describing with specificity the action appealed from and the reliefsought. The filing of such a request will be necessary to seek judicialreview of an initial determination. Such appeals will be processed underthe time-frames and other requirements of the Board's standard applicationsprocessing guidelines at 12 CFR 571.12. The Director of the Office of District Banks, with the concurrence of theExecutive Director of the Office of Regulatory Activities, and the GeneralCounsel, or their respective designees shall consider appeals from denialsby the PSAs unless the Director of the Office of District Banks in hisor her sole discretion determines to refer the appeal to the Board on thebasis that the appeal involves policy considerations that warrant resolutionby the Board. In the event that the Director of the Office of DistrictBanks fails to obtain the concurrence of the Executive Director of theOffice of Regulatory Activities and the General Counsel, the Director ofthe Office of District Banks shall present the matter to the Board. 8. Standard Conditions of Approval The Board has considered the concept that one of the ``standard conditions''to be included in the regulation could require that before any offers orsales of the subordinated debt are made on the premises of the institutionor any of its affiliates, the applicant shall submit to the SupervisoryAgent a set of policies and procedures for such sale of the subordinateddebt satisfactory to the supervisory agent. Such policies and procedureswould address the considerations set forth by the Office of RegulatoryActivities in its Thrift Bulletin 23 issued on April 13, 1989. The Boardhas considered such an idea to have substantial merit and has includedsuch a provision in the final regulation. With the foregoing addition, the Board is adopting the proposed set ofstandard conditions that will apply to all approvals of subordinated debtapplications. The Board anticipates that such conditions will, except inrare cases, be the only conditions applied to subordinated debt approvals.Other conditions would be imposed only where one or more of the bases forsupervisory objection specified in the Guidelines developed by the Officeof Regulatory Activities in consultation with the Office of District Banksand the Office of General Counsel are present and where such non-standardconditions are necessary to address the areas of concern that would otherwiseform a basis for denial of the application. These standard conditions ofapproval also will apply to any subordinated debt application that is approvedautomatically pursuant to the Board's Applications Processing Guidelinesfound at 12 CFR 571.12. For technical considerations, these conditionsare now included in the text of the rule rather than in a separate appendixas proposed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604,the Board is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis: 1. <T3>Reasons, objectives, and legal basis underlying the rule. </T3>Theseelements are incorporated above in <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2>.2. <T3>Small entities to which the proposed rule applies.</T3> The final rulewill apply to all FSLIC-insured institutions without regard to size. However,the Small Business Administration defines a small financial institutionas a ``commercial bank or savings and loan association, the assets of which,for the preceding fiscal year, do not exceed $100 million.'' 13 CFR 121.13(a)(1987).Therefore, small entities to which the rule applies are the 1,651 insuredinstitutions that had assets totaling $100 million or less as of December31, 1987. 3. <T3>Impact of the final rule on small entities.</T3> The Board believesthat the revision to procedures for processing subordinated debt securitiesapplications will not have a disparate effect on small entities. To theextent that under the revised regulations small entities will more likelybe able to file their applications at their district Federal Home LoanBank, the impact of the proposal will be liberalizing. 4. <T3>Overlapping or conflicting Federal rules.</T3> There are no known federalrules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this rule. 5. <T3>Alternatives to the final rule.</T3> There are no alternatives thatwould be less burdensome than the rule changes addressing the concernsexpressed in the <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2> set for above. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 563 </ITAG>Bank deposit insurance, Currency, Investments, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Savings and loan associations.Accordingly, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board hereby amends Part 563, SubchapterD, Chapter V, Title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="72">SUBCHAPTER D_FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 563_OPERATIONS </ITAG>1.
