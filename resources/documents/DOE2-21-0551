A correspondence between the insulinconcentration in the defined medium (1-100 ng/ml) and both the rate ofincrease and maximum attained level of ChoAcT activity was observed.Maximal ChoAcT activity was 2- to 3-fold greater in cells cultured inthe presence of 100 ng of insulin per ml than in cells cultured in thepresence of 1 ng of insulin per ml. To elicit maximum ChoAcT activity,insulin at 100 ng/ml was required in the medium for only the first 4days of the culture period, at which time insulin could be reduced tomaintenance levels (10 ng/ml) without affecting ChoAcT activity. Insulinbinding assays performed during a 7-day culture period revealed thatirrespective of the {sup 125}I-insulin concentration in the medium duringculture, cell-surface insulin receptors decreased by {approx} 90% between4 and 7 days in culture. This decrease in insulin binding correspondedto the observed decrease in the sensitivity of ChoAcT activity to insulin.The findings suggest that insulin plays a role in mediating cholinergicdifferentiation in the embryonic chicken retina.</TEXT></DOC>
