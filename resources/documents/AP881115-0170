The Commission on Base Realignment and Closure, in a 2{-pagestatement, outlined a five-step process ``for the evaluation ofmajor military installations within the United States, itsterritories, commonwealths and possessions.''   ``We're going to be running everything under the microscope, andthis simply explains how,'' said Jim Abbee, a spokesman for thepanel.   ``You can't make any inference from this that any base is or isnot likely to be recommended for closure. You'll have to wait untilDec. 31 for that.''   Legislation signed by President Reagan last month authorized the12-member citizens' commission to review the nation's military basesand to decide which are outmoded and can be closed, at a projectedannual savings of $2 billion to $5 billion.   The panel has until Dec. 31 to report its findings to DefenseSecretary Frank C. Carlucci, who may forward the list to Congress ifhe wishes. Should he decide to do so, Congress can veto the entirelist but cannot act to protect individual bases, as it often has inthe past.   The ``all-or-nothing'' legal procedure is viewed as offering thebest chance in more than a decade to actually close unneededmilitary bases over the objection of local congressmen.   According to Tuesday's statement, the commission is firstgrouping together ``by mission'' the military facilities across thecountry; for example, all Army depots, all Air Force fighter bases,all Navy submarine ports.   ``The second step will evaluate bases within the category todetermine whether additional mission capacity exists beyond current,future or mobilization requirements,'' the panel added.   After reviewing overall capacity, the commission said it wouldbegin evaluating each individual base on five factors: missionsuitability, including geographical environment and ease ofdeployment; the physical facilities in place; the quality of thosefacilities; the quality of life for personnel such as housing, andcommunity support.   The bases that rank at the bottom of each ``mission'' list willthen be considered for closure by determining if other bases higheron the list are in a position to become ``receiving'' bases, thepanel added.   ``The combination of possible realignments and the closing of thebase will be considered as a package for cost evaluation ...,'' thestatement says.   In the final step, the ``package'' of a ``closing base'' and ``areceiving base'' will be reviewed for environmental concerns such ashazardous waste problems and for socio-economic impact ``in the formof evaluation of the potential closure's impact on localemployment.''   Abbee said the commission is in the midst of applying theprocedure to 871 large military facilities. He declined to predicthow many of them might end up on the recommended closure list.</TEXT></DOC>
