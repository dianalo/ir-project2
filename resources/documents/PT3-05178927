It will      be understood that the multi-layer laminated trim panels can be contoured      according to the customer's needs. </PAR><PAR>  The major components of the multi-layer laminated trim panel 10, as shown      in FIG. 1, include a first sheet of relatively high density cross-linked      polyethylene foam 20, a second sheet of relatively low density      cross-linked polyethylene foam 30 and a plurality of fasteners 12 wherein      the fastener heads are entrapped between the first and second sheets of      cross-linked polyethylene foam. A third sheet of cross-linked polyethylene      foam 40 as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 can also be included. Likewise, one or      more buns in FIG. 6 can be incorporated between the first and second      sheets. Each of the multi-layered trim panel embodiments can be provided      with an external covering 50. </PAR><PAR>  Various different types of conventional fasteners 12 can be utilized with      the present invention as demonstrated by FIGS. 3A through 3D. The type of      fastener is selected according to the customer's needs. Although many      different types of fasteners may be used, it has been determined that      fasteners having a relatively large flat head are best suited to limit the      foam breakaway values during the manufacturing process and to maximize      ultimate fastening strength. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention resides in the assembly of the trim panel, which has      fasteners entrapped between first and second sheets of cross-linked      polyethylene foam 20 and 30, respectively. It has been determined that      fasteners having an elongated flat head are best suited for the invention.      Referring to the embodiments of FIGS. 1 and 2, the trim panel 10 includes      a first sheet of relatively high density cross-linked polyethylene foam 20      having a top surface 24, a bottom surface 26 and one or more side edges 28      depending on the desired shape of the trim panel. This first sheet of      cross-linked polyethylene foam 20 generally has a thickness in the range      of between about 0.100 and about 0.150 inches with a standard thickness of      approximately 0.125 inches. For the purposes of this invention, relatively      high density cross-linked polyethylene foam is defined as cross-linked      polyethylene foam having a density in the range of between about 10      lbs/ft..sup.3 to about 14 lbs./ft..sup.3. A preferred high density      cross-linked polyethylene foam is Huls' brand XJ1200 which has a density      of approximately 12 lbs/ft..sup.3. </PAR><PAR>  The first sheet 20 is formed with a plurality of apertures 22 at      preselected locations along the sheet which provide for the attachment of      any one of several different types of mechanical fasteners 12. Upon      complete insertion into the apertures 22, the fastener heads 14 abut the      top surface 24 of the first sheet 20 and the leading end 18 of the      fastener shaft 16 extends beyond the bottom surface 26. </PAR><PAR>  A second sheet of relatively low density cross-linked polyethylene foam 30      also includes a top surface 32, a bottom surface 34 and one or more side      edges 36. The second sheet 30 is positioned contiguously upon the first      sheet 20 such that the bottom surface 34 of this second sheet 30 is bonded      to the top surface 24 of the first sheet 20, thereby entrapping the      fastener heads 14. The second sheet 30 has a general thickness in the      range of between about 0.100 and about 1.500 inches. The thickness of the      second sheet 30 is dictated by the customer's needs. For example, when the      trim panel 10 is to be used on pillars, mainly for decorative purposes,      the sheet thickness tends to be about 0.125 inches, however, when the trim      panel 10 is to be used for side impact protection on vehicle doors, the      thickness tends to be about 1.500 inches. It will be understood that the      second sheets' thickness can be varied over the course of the sheet to      provide the sheet with a contoured appearance. For the purposes of this      invention, relatively low density cross-linked polyethylene foam is      defined as cross-linked polyethylene foam having a density in the range of      between about 2 lbs./ft.sup.3 to about 4 lbs./ft.sup.3. Huls' brand XJ200,      which has density of approximately 2 lbs./ft.sup.3 is a preferred brand. </PAR><PAR>  A cover sheet 50 made of a cloth, vinyl or a combination of cloth and vinyl      is bonded to the top surface 32 of the second sheet 30 and the side edges      28 and 36 of both the first and second sheets 20 and 30 to provide the      multi-layer laminated trim panel 10 with a decorative appearance. Milliken      302WCK Textura is a preferred brand of decorative cloth and Haartz 5A is a      preferred brand of vinyl. An adhesive or bonding agent may be applied to      the top surface 32 and side edges 28 and 36 of the second sheet 30 before      the cover sheet 50 is bonded to the top surface 32 for increased adhesion.      A film adhesive such as Avery Fastape 8706UHA or a spray adhesive such as      XR-1305/1375 brand by the H. B. Fuller Co. are preferred brands. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to embodiments of FIGS. 4 and 5, three-layer laminated trim      panels are shown, wherein the second sheet 30 of cross-linked polyethylene      foam is sandwiched between first and third sheets 20 and 40, respectively.      In these embodiments, the first sheet is comprised is relatively high      density cross-linked polyethylene foam and the third sheet is comprised of      relatively low density cross-linked polyethylene foam as previously      described. The second sheet of cross-linked polyethylene foam 30 generally      has a medium density in the range of about 6 lbs./ft.sup.3 to about 8      lbs./ft.sup.3. Huls' brand XJ600, which has a density of approximately 6      lbs./ft.sup.3 is a preferred brand. The second sheet 30 is positioned      contiguously upon the first sheet 20 such that the bottom surface 34 of      the second sheet 30 is bonded to the top surface 24 of the first sheet 20,      thereby entrapping the fastener heads 14. The third sheet 40 is positioned      contiguously upon the second sheet 30 such that the bottom surface 44 of      the third sheet 40 is bonded to the top surface 32 of the second sheet 30.      A cover sheet 50 is bonded to the top surface 42 of the third sheet 40 and      the side edges 28, 36 and 46 of sheets 20, 30 and 40 respectively. Again,      it may be desirable to provide the top surface 42 and side edges 28, 36      and 46 with an adhesive such as Avery Fastape 8706UHA or H. B. Fuller Co.      brand XR-1305/1375. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 6, a trim panel 10 which can be used for side impact      protection includes a first thermoformed sheet of relatively high density      cross-linked polyethylene foam 20 having a recessed portion 21 is shown.      The recessed portion 21 houses a piece of cross-linked polyethylene,      referred to herein as a bun, having a density in the range of between      about 6 lbs./ft.sup.3 to about 8 lbs./ft.sup.3. A second sheet of      relatively low density cross-linked polyethylene foam 30 is positioned      upon the first sheet 20 such that the fastener heads 14 are entrapped      between the first and second sheets 20 and 30 and the bun 31 is entrapped      within the recessed portion 21 of first sheet 20 below the second sheet      30. </PAR><PAR>  The various multi-layer laminated trim panels 10 can be manufactured as      demonstrated in FIGS. 7, 8, and 9, where like reference numerals are used      for similar parts. The embodiments of FIGS. 1 and 5 are manufactured      according to the method demonstrated in FIG. 7. A heating oven 60 heated      to about 300.degree. F. having two separate conveyors 62 and 64 which are      operable at different speeds is shown. A first sheet of relatively high      density cross-linked polyethylene foam 20 containing fasteners 12 inserted      through apertures 22 is placed upon the first conveyor 62 which carries      the sheet 20 into the oven 60. When this first sheet 20 reaches a      predetermined point within the oven 60, a second sheet of relatively low      density cross-linked polyethylene foam 30 is placed on the second conveyor      64 which carries it into the oven 60. The more dense first sheet 20      requires a greater amount of oven exposure time than the less dense second      sheet 30 to become sufficiently tacky for subsequent chemical bonding of      the sheets to occur. The first conveyor 62 is therefore run at a slower      speed than the second conveyor 64 so that the first sheet 20 exits the      oven 60 just prior to the second sheet 30. </PAR><PAR>  Once the first sheet 20 has exited the oven 60, the first sheet 20 is      placed in a compression mold press 66 with the fastener heads 14 facing      upwardly. Shortly thereafter, while the first sheet 20 is still hot, the      second sheet 30 is placed contiguously over the first sheet in the      compression mold press 66 as demonstrated by arrows 68 so that the      fastener heads 14 are positioned between the first and second sheets 20      and 30, respectively. The cover sheet 50 is then positioned over the first      surface 32 of second sheet 30 and the compression mold press 66 is closed      to cut and form the trim panel 10 to its specified shape and size.      Depending upon the customer's needs, an adhesive may be applied over the      first surface 32 of the second sheet 30 and the side edges of the first      sheet 20 prior to positioning the cover sheet 50 over the second sheet 30.      When the compression mold press 66 is closed, the fastener heads 14 become      partially recessed into the first surface 26 of the first sheet 20 and the      second surface 34 of the second sheet 30 due to the flaccid nature of the      first and second sheets 20 and 30. By recessing the fastener heads 14, the      trim panel 10 obtains structural rigidity once the trim panel 10 cures. </PAR><PAR>  The embodiment of FIG. 5 is manufactured similarly to the embodiment of      FIG. 1 except that a third sheet of cross-linked polyethylene foam 40,      shown in phantom in FIG. 7, is provided. The third sheet of relatively low      density cross-linked polyethylene foam 40 is placed upon the second      conveyor 64 immediately behind the second sheet of medium density      cross-linked polyethylene foam 30. The first sheet of relatively low      density cross-linked polyethylene foam 20 is placed in a compression mold      press 66 as it exits the oven 60 with the fastener heads 14 facing      upwardly. The second sheet 30 is then placed contiguously over the first      sheet in the compression mold 66 as demonstrated by arrow 68 and the third      sheet 40 is contiguously positioned over the second sheet 30. Cover sheet      50 is then positioned over the first surface 42 of the third sheet 40 and      the compression mold press 66 is closed to cut and form the trim panel 10      to its specified shape and size. Again, depending on the customer's needs,      an adhesive may be applied over the first surface 42 of the third sheet 40      and the side edges of the first and second sheets 20 and 30 prior to      positioning the cover sheet 50 over the third sheet 40. When the      compression mold press 66 is closed, the fastener heads 14 become      partially recessed into the top surface 26 of the first sheet 20 and the      bottom surface 34 of the second sheet 30 due to the flaccid nature of the      first and second sheets 20 and 30, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  The multi-layer laminated trim panels 10 of FIGS. 2 and 4 are manufactured      as demonstrated by FIG. 8. The embodiment of FIG. 2 is manufactured by      placing a first sheet of relatively high density cross-linked polyethylene      foam 20 which is at room temperature and has fasteners 12 inserted through      apertures 22 in the compression mold press 66 with the fastener heads 14      facing upwardly. A second sheet of medium density cross-linked      polyethylene foam 30 is placed on a conveyor 62 which carries the second      sheet 30 into and through an oven 60 which is heated to about 300.degree.      F. The second sheet 30 remains in the oven 60 just long enough to become      sufficiently tacky to bond to both the first sheet 20 and the cover sheet      50. </PAR><PAR>  Once through the oven 60, the second sheet 30 is placed contiguously upon      the first sheet 20 in the compression mold press 66 so that the fastener      heads 14 are positioned between the first and second sheets 20 and 30,      respectively. A cover sheet 50 is then positioned over the top surface 32      of the second sheet 30 and the compression mold press 66 which contains a      mold having the three dimensional contour of a finished panel is closed,      as demonstrated by arrows 68, to cut and form the trim panel to its      specified shape and size. Here again, depending upon the customer's needs,      an adhesive may be applied over the first surface 32 of the second sheet      30 and the side edges of the first sheet 20 prior to positioning the cover      sheet 50 over the second sheet 30. The fastener heads 14 become recessed      within the second sheet 30 due to the flaccid nature of the second sheet      30. </PAR><PAR>  The embodiment of FIG. 4 is manufactured similarly to the embodiment of      FIG. 2, except that a third sheet of cross-linked polyethylene foam 40,      shown in phantom in FIG. 8, is provided. The third sheet of relatively low      density cross-linked polyethylene foam 40 is placed upon the conveyor 62      just behind the second sheet of medium density cross-linked polyethylene      foam 30. Once through the oven 60, which is heated to 300.degree. F., the      second sheet 30 is placed contiguously upon the first sheet in the      compression mold 66 so that the fastener heads 14 are positioned between      the first and second sheets 20 and 30, respectively. The third sheet 40 is      then positioned over the top surface 32 of the second sheet 30 and a cover      sheet 50 is placed over the top surface 42 of the third sheet 40. It may      be desirable to apply an adhesive over the top surface 42 of the third      sheet 40 and the side edges of the first and second sheets 20 and 30 prior      to positioning the cover sheet 50 over the top surface 42. Compression      mold 66 which contains a mold having the three dimensional contour of the      finished panel is then closed, as demonstrated by arrow 68 to cut and form      the trim panel to its specify shape and size. During compression in the      compression mold, the fastener heads 14 become recessed within the second      sheet 30 due to the flaccid nature of the second sheet 30. </PAR><PAR>  The embodiment of FIG. 6 is manufactured as demonstrated by FIG. 9. The      first sheet of thermoformed high density cross-linked polyethylene foam 20      which is at room temperature and has fasteners 12 inserted through      apertures 22 is placed in the compression mold press 66 with the fastener      heads 14 facing upwardly. A bun 31 made of medium density cross-linked      polyethylene foam is placed within the recessed portion 21 of the first      sheet 20 within the compression mold press 66. A second sheet of      relatively low density cross-linked polyethylene foam 30 is placed on a      conveyor 62 which carries the second sheet 30 into and through an oven 60      which is heated to about 300.degree. F. The second sheet 30 remains in the      oven 60 long enough to become sufficiently tacky to bond to both the first      surface 22 of the first sheet 20, the top surface 33 of the bun 31 and the      cover sheet 50. </PAR><PAR>  Once through the oven 60, the second sheet 30 is placed contiguously upon      the first sheet 20 and over the bun 31 in the compression mold press 66 so      that the fastener heads 14 are positioned between the first and second      sheets 20 and 30, respectively. A cover sheet 50 is then positioned over      the top surface 32 of the second sheet 30 and the compression mold press      66 which contains a mold having the three dimensional contour of a      finished panel is closed, as demonstrated by arrows 68 to cut and form the      trim panel 10 to its specified shape and size. It may once again be      desirable to apply an adhesive over the top surface 32 and side edges of      the first sheet 30 and bun 31 prior to positioning the cover sheet 50 over      the top surface 32. The fastener heads 14 become recessed within the      second sheet 30 due to the flaccid nature of the second sheet 30. </PAR><PAR>  While it will be apparent that the preferred embodiment of the invention      disclosed are well calculated to provide the advantages above stated, it      will be appreciated that the invention is susceptible to modification,      variation and change without department from the proper scope or fair      meaning of the subjoined claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
