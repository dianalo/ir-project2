Gasoline futures price plunged in record turnover yesterday amid signs of swollen supplies, softer demand and increased output. Gasoline's retreat led other oil prices lower.    The slide underscored developments that may promise motorists good news at the pump. An oil industry report shows gasoline inventories are 15% larger than a year ago while demand has slackened a bit. And there are indications that Saudi Arabian wells are pumping much more oil than a month ago.    Statistics released by the American Petroleum Institute after the market closed Tuesday show that U.S. gasoline inventories exceed year-earlier levels by 31.5 million barrels, or about 15%. Demand over the past month ran 3.1% behind a year earlier, analysts noted.    The inventory report also showed that U.S. refiners operated at 80.4% of capacity in the week ended last Friday, compared with 78.3% the week before and 77.4% a year earlier. This is the second significant increase in the past three weeks and suggests higher output of refined products is coming.    &quot;These aren't just fluky statistics based on one week; these are underlying fundamental trends,&quot; said Robert Boslego, vice president of Boslego Corp., a Winchester, Mass., trading firm.    Meanwhile, some refiners' sales to gasoline distributors are poor, said Nauman Barakat, energy futures analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York.    &quot;Oil companies are getting very concerned about the large inventories they have built,&quot; Mr. Barakat said.    As for motorists, &quot;they shouldn't be terribly worried about gasoline prices coming into the driving season.&quot; said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.    Mr. Boslego said that with &quot;high stockpiles, lower demand and higher production, support for gasoline prices this spring is likely to erode.&quot;    Meanwhile, news service reports estimated Saudi Arabian crude oil production averaged between 3.3 million and 3.5 million barrels a day for the first week of April, a surge of more than 40% from the same week a month ago. The largest producer within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Saudi Arabia has an output quota of 4.133 million barrels a day under the cartel's accord.    Meanwhile, private industry analysts estimated that the United Arab Emirates, a small OPEC member, produced between one million and 1.2 million barrels a day in March, exceeding its quota of 902,000 barrels a day by as much as one-third.    Unleaded gasoline for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange skidded 1.71 cents a gallon to 51.56 cents. The record estimated volume of 18,057 contracts surpassed by 18% the previous mark of 15,254, set March 24. May heating oil slipped 1.09 cents a gallon to 48.15 cents. May crude oil fell 19 cents a barrel to $18.65.    Some traders attributed the relative strength of crude oil prices to technical factors, including trading so-called crack spreads, or the margin between prices of refined products and crude oil. Yesterday, traders sold gasoline and heating oil contracts and bought the less-costly crude, betting that the price margin between the refined products and crude will narrow, said Eric Bolling, an oil broker at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in Boston.    A barrel of oil equals 42 gallons, so yesterday's crude price was the equivalent of 44 cents a gallon.    Most spot, or noncontract, prices, also fell. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, fell 20 cents a barrel to $18.65, while the May price of North Sea Brent, the abundantly-traded European blend, fell 15 cents a barrel to $18 in late trading.    Also yesterday, the Dow Jones International Petroleum Report news service said European oil industry sources indicated the Soviet Union agreed to sell 50,000 barrels a day of its Urals blend crude to a major international oil company at prices pegged to the spot price of North Sea Brent.    The reported contract, which would be a departure from the Soviet December decision to set an official fixed selling price, isn't expected to have an immediate effect on world oil prices, analysts said. </TEXT></DOC>
