Trading was light, with many European markets closed for the Ascension Day holiday. In late New York trading, the pound stood at $1.6288, up 0.8% from $1.6155 Wednesday.    Although the British government reported that the country's visible trade deficit widened in April, the figure wasn't as bad as some analysts expected. The deficit also was small enough to keep Britain's current account in surplus.    The data took on greater importance than usual to currency traders because of the June 11 national elections, in which British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party government is favored to be reelected. A poorer trade performance might have given a boost to the Conservatives' opponents, whose policies traders fear could hamper Britain's economic growth.    The pound had fallen earlier in the week because of indications that the Thatcher government's lead in public-opinion polls was narrowing.    &quot;The pound is in its pre-election gyration phase,&quot; Trevor W. Woodland, vice president, foreign exchange, at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said. &quot;It's going to remain a fairly nervous market for the next week or so.&quot;    Britain's Department of Trade and Industry said the country's visible trade deficit widened to 504 million pounds ($821 million) last month, compared with a revised 417 million pounds in March and 255 million pounds in April 1986.    With April's surplus in invisible trade estimated at 600 million pounds, Britain's April current account showed a surplus of 96 million pounds, compared with a revised surplus of 183 million pounds in March and a surplus of 231 million pounds in the year-earlier month.    &quot;These figures weren't excellent numbers, but there was the background fear that they would be horrible,&quot; Mr. Woodland said.    The dollar, which generally showed little movement yesterday, appeared to get some support from remarks by Federal Reserve Board Governor H. Robert Heller, speaking at a conference in New York. Mr. Heller said the U.S. government shouldn't rely exclusively on exchange rates or monetary policy to reduce the nation's current-account deficit. The dollar's intraday low of 143.05 yen was reached just before the Fed governor spoke.    &quot;Focusing economic policy on just one variable places too much burden on that instrument alone and runs the risk of introducing additional instability somewhere else in the economic system,&quot; Mr. Heller said.    Some traders yesterday said the dollar is entering another period of trading in a narrow range, as it has done for much of this month, but at a slightly higher level as a result of its surge Tuesday.    The U.S. currency eased to 1.8170 West German marks from 1.8183 Wednesday and to 143.35 Japanese yen from 143.38.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 143.53 yen.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery climbed $5.20 an ounce to $453.40 in brisk trading. Estimated volume was 5.7 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $452.25 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                 LATE NEW YORK TRADING                 Thursday, May 28, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
