In a circular published yesterday, the British central bank clarified a major area of uncertainty in the international plan. The Bank of England said it won't allow British banks' general provisions for likely losses from Third World lending to be counted as capital.    The central bank also said the 8% ratio between a bank's eligible capital and a weighted total of its assets, proposed by the 12 nations as a new international standard for 1992, should be a minimum for British banks. &quot;In the great majority of cases, the ratios agreed for individual banks are expected to be above&quot; the 8% level, the Bank of England said.    In December, international bank supervisors made an important advance toward increasing the stability of the world banking system by proposing specific capital-adequacy rules for internationally active banks in the industrialized world. The bank supervisors said their proposals would be discussed with banks during this year's first half.    Anxious to achieve a complete international agreement quickly, the Bank of England has given the British banks until March 31 to respond to its ideas. In its circular, the Bank of England said it intends to apply its new rules to virtually all institutions authorized under British banking law. The only exceptions would be certain specialized bodies such as money funds and discount houses.    The Bank of England also proposes to continue present British regulations that avoid double-counting of capital within banking groups. These are tougher than the basic rules worked out by the international supervisors' committee.    In addition, the British central bank wants to apply more-restrictive standards to the asset side of British banks' balance sheets. The supervisors' committee said individual bank supervisors could apply a zero weighting to bank holdings of domestic central government securities because such securities are considered to be without credit risk.    The Bank of England, however, said such securities should be given a 10% weighting if they mature in less than a year; this weighting would rise to 20% if they carry a maturity of more than a year. It argued that banks can incur losses through holding such investments if, for example, interest rates rise.    In keeping with the British central bank's concern over the rapid growth of credit, the Bank of England also plans to limit the capacity of banks to apply a low 50% weighting to mortgages on their books. The central bank said such mortgage loans should only qualify for the 50% weighting when the loans have been granted to people buying their main residence. </TEXT></DOC>
