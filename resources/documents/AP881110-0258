(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   GTE Corp. is taking a much-needed step aswell as following a national trend by announcing it would trim 7,000jobs _ some through layoffs _ in the next four years, analysts said.   ``They definitely have too many people relative to othertelephone companies,'' Geoff Johnson, a telecommunications analystwith Argus Research in New York, said Wednesday after the companyannounced the planned cuts.   ``It's also part of a broader trend in the industry ... everyonehas been trying to cut costs and reducing through attrition earlyretirement,'' he said.   GTE said the previously announced restructuring of its telephoneoperations would result in nearly 7,000 personnel reductions by 1992.   The company said in a statement the reductions would come fromstaff functions that support local service operations. Totalemployment for GTE's domestic telephone companies and associatedheadquarters staff is about 85,000 and about 28,000 of those peopleare in staff positions.   GTE announced plans to streamline its telephone operations inMarch to continue improving service quality and to become faster,more flexible and responsive to customer requirements.   The company said some of the reductions would come from earlyretirement offerings.   ``We expect as many as 2,000 people may take advantage of this(early retirement) option,'' said Kent B. Foster, group vicepresident of GTE Telephone Operating Group. ``In addition, we havehad a virtual hiring freeze in place throughout most of this year,so a number of already-vacant positions simply will go unfilled.''   He said some employees would be reassigned to positions in otherGTE businesses.   ``Some layoffs are inevitable, however, and will be used only asa last resort,'' Foster said. ``The majority of these will come fromour management ranks and will occur over time.''   The company would not project the number that would be laid off.   Johnson projected that GTE's plan could save them about $93million a year for three years. He said that savings does notinclude severance costs.   James L. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer, said``These reductions are expected to generate substantial annual costsavings, which will be reflected over time in rate reductions to GTEcustomers and in improved earnings for GTE shareholders.''   Johnson also said that additional reductions unrelated to thisrestructuring would occur over the next five years as the companyinstitutes changes brought about by new technologies.   GTE had revenue of $15.4 billion in 1987. Its three corebusinesses _ telecommunications, lighting and precision materials _employ about 161,000 people in 44 states and 38 other countries.</TEXT></DOC>
