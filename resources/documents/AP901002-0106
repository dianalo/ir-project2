A shopkeeper, Mohammad Anwar, said he saw a government officialbeing stopped by the troops in the street and made to sit down onthe pavement.   ``Then they just shot him in the head and threw him into aburning shop,'' Anwar said.

There were reports that 200 schoolchildren had not returnedhome, he said. Handwara has a population of about 30,000.
