(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A robot with a neutronray gun that spots deadly corrosion in Air Force jets could becomean important weapon in ensuring the safety of the nation's agingcommercial airliners.   The new, computer-controlled machine is being programmed to testF-111 fighter-bombers and other planes inside a specially builthangar at this Sacramento-area base.   Even before it goes into day-to-day use in mid-1990, the FederalAviation Administration has commissioned a study to see if versionsof the $7.3 million hangar would be practical for use on civilianairliners.   The new machine can scan an entire airliner in a period ofhours, zeroing in on problem spots, say the private engineers whodesigned it.   ``You've got to find that Achilles' heel,'' said Doug Froom, thecivilian Air Force employee who designed the device. ``That's whatthis system is good at.''   The safety of the nation's passenger jets has taken on newsignificance since a section of fuselage peeled off the top of anAloha Airlines Boeing 737 over Hawaii in April 1988. That accident,which killed a flight attendant, was blamed on metal fatigue in theairliner's skin.   The FAA responded by ordering airlines to inspect the outside oftheir planes more thoroughly for cracks that could indicate metalfatigue. And earlier this month, the agency revealed it waspreparing a series of orders requiring airlines to regularly stripthe insides of airliners to check for corrosion, a problem similarto metal fatigue.   The N-ray, say its designers, could take the place of thetime-consuming searches the FAA will order.   The corrosion-detector at McClellan shoots neutrons _ one of theparticles that makes up the atom _ through a plane to a receiver onthe other side.   Neutrons penetrate metal but are absorbed by the hydrogen in thedust produced by corrosion. The neutron flow is translated into atelevision image that inspectors can watch and record.   The scanner is held by a flexible arm, operated by remotecontrol inside a hangar with concrete walls thick enough to containerrant low-level radiation. The designers say the radiation isn't ahealth threat to workers who follow safety precautions.   But airline industry representatives said the machine has majordrawbacks, not the least of which is its high cost. They also citedradiation fears, though those aren't considered a problem at theAir Force installation, and the potential difficulty of adjustingthe machine to scan airliners.   Boeing Co. spokesman Jack Gamble, asked to list objections otherthan cost, said, ``I'm not going to give 10 reasons why we don'twant to use it. It's a technical question.''   Consumer groups, which have criticized existing inspectionefforts as outdated and inadequate, said they want to make sure thecontroversy over the N-ray centers on the device's effectivenessrather than its cost.   ``If it reveals corrosion in the places in which traditionallyit's been hard to find, then what price safety?'' said RichardLivingston of the International Airline Passengers Association.``It's hard to imagine anything costing too much to safeguard humanlife.''   The firm that built the robot, Cimcorp Robotic Systems of St.Paul, Minn., said it could make a machine big enough to scan thelargest commercial airliner for about $30 million, without countingthe cost of a radiation-shielded building to house it.   Cimcorp's Ken Bucher contrasted that to the cost of a commercialjetliner, which runs up to about $125 million for a Boeing 747.``You look at that cost against the cost of one airliner and thatnumber becomes small again,'' he said.   The Air Force says the N-ray device _ and an adjoining X-rayinspection station similar to those already in use in the industry_ should make back their $28.7 million cost in two years by savingon maintenance spending. The N-ray, for example, can do in 16 hourswhat human inspectors would need several months to do if they hadto dismantle the plane.   Earlier this year, the FAA, which oversees commercial airtransportation, awarded a New Jersey-based research firm, GalaxyScientific Corp., a $47 million contract to study the N-ray andother inspection techniques.</TEXT></DOC>
