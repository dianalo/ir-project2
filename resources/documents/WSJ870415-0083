Christian HillStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN)CONSTRUCTION, MATERIALS (CON)REAL ESTATE, REITS, LAND DEVELOPMENT (REL)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   Turmoil in the mortgage markets has caused rates for fixed-rate home loans to soar as much as two percentage points in the past month, one of the fastest and sharpest reversals ever. And the chaos is beginning to restrict the availability of mortgage credit itself.    There's still debate about whether the rise will continue. But already the huge rate hike is touching off a stampede of home buyers and owners, seeking to use commitments from lenders issued at lower rates or to obtain loans before rates go higher. But they may be out of luck; many lenders won't have to honor commitments because of escape clauses built into the contracts.    At the same time, many lenders are reluctant to quote rates right now, and are considering refraining from issuing commitments that guarantee rates.    &quot;The ability to quote rates has been seriously impaired,&quot; says James Wooten, president of Lomas andamp; Nettleton Co., one of the country's biggest mortgage bankers. &quot;You have to question the prudence of making any kind of commitment. What do you do, make a commitment for two hours? Wall Street is making commitments that last two seconds.&quot;    Lomas andamp; Nettleton is quoting a 30-year rate, but it has jumped by two percentage points in the past four weeks to 10.875% from 8.875%. Its 15-year rate has soared to 10.375% from 8.5%.    Adds Frank Howard, president and chief executive officer of McLean Financial Corp., a mortgage-bank holding company, &quot;It will be very, very hard for anyone to guarantee a rate or points until the loan is ready to close.&quot;    The turmoil stems from the fact that most fixed-rate mortgages are now bundled into securities, for sale in the so-called secondary market to big investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, banks and thrifts. These investors seek yields similar to comparable U.S. or corporate bonds.    The soaring interest rates in the bond market therefore have spilled over quickly into the mortgage market. And mortgage rates have increased even more sharply than other interest rates; that's because when rates rise, investors expect mortgage refinancings to decline, making it likely that mortgage securities won't be paid off as quickly as before. So they demand higher rates on what they now view as longer-term securities.    Dennis Jacobe, research director for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, says that home buyers will have to get used to mortgage rates bouncing up or down in response to the same forces that drive the bond market. Bond rates have soared recently because of concern about the weakening dollar, the trade deficit and tentative signs of higher inflation.    &quot;We are to the point that the American home buyer is being affected by the value of the yen,&quot; Mr. Jacobe says. &quot;The new tie-in with the capital markets is really coming through to the average person's mortgage rate.&quot;    Some real-estate agents and home builders report a surge in activity by consumers trying to beat the higher rates. &quot;In the 10 days, we've had a tremendous spurt&quot; in traffic, says Richard J. Loughlin, president and chief executive of Century 21 Real Estate, a nationwide real-estate brokerage based in Irvine, Calif. &quot;A lot of people have decided to go out there and make that purchase.&quot;    Home builders say traffic at their new-home developments is just beginning to be affected. &quot;The interest-rate issue wasn't really significant until Friday,&quot; says Chad Dreier, a senior vice president at Kaufman andamp; Broad Home Corp., a large Los Angeles-based builder. While &quot;it's not a consensus&quot; yet, he says, &quot;we've had more impetus (from customers) towards, 'Gee, we better get in.'&quot;    An official of Lindal Cedar Homes Inc. in Seattle said home buyers who have houses on order for delivery are &quot;calling to hurry up orders&quot; in cases where rates haven't been locked in by the contract. And Lindal's salespeople are using the prospect of future rate increases as a sales tactic, adds Chairman Walter Lindal.    Adjustable-rate mortgages are expected to become more attractive in the near term, because the gap between fixed rates and the introductory rate for adjustables is growing. Many thrifts so far are keeping their &quot;teaser rate&quot; for adjustable rates as low as 7.5%. But the indices on which adjustable rates are based, such as the thrifts' average cost of funds, will eventually force rates on these mortgages to reflect the general rise in interest rates.    Meanwhile, savings and loan associations, many of whom keep their mortgages rather than resell them, have increased their rates less sharply than mortgage bankers. Stockton Savings andamp; Loan of Stockton, Calif., lifted its 30-year rate to 10% from 9.25% two weeks ago. Washington Federal Savings andamp; Loan of Seattle, Wash., yesterday increased its rate to 10.375% from a low of 8.875% at March 30.    &quot;If it doesn't get any worse than this, I don't think it's going to have a serious impact,&quot; says Charles R. Richmond, an executive vice president at Washington Federal. &quot;At or near 10%, we still have a pretty broad portion of the public than can qualify (for a home loan). If rates go beyond 11%, then we're in the soup again.&quot;    Mortgage rates have jumped sharply before in response to bond-market volatility, notably in a brief upswing last spring and in October 1979 when the Federal Reserve Board started to let interest rates jump. But the volatility in the past two days is unprecedented. Yesterday morning, enormous swings in the price of some mortgage securities occurred &quot;in the blink of an eye,&quot; says McLean Financial's Mr. Howard. &quot;I've never seen anything like it in my 14 years in mortgage banking.&quot;    Toward the end of the day, rates demanded by investors were up again from the day before. At 3 p.m. (EDT), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. was asking a net yield of 10.32% on 30-year mortgages for delivery within 60 days it was offering to buy, up from a close of 10.14% the day before. In four weeks its required yield has jumped about 17.5%. The interest rates paid by home buyers or owners are generally one-quarter to one-half of a percentage point higher than loan agency's yields.    Meanwhile, securities traders and economists are sharply divided on the outlook for fixed mortage rates. &quot;What you're seeing in the last week is an aberration,&quot; says Lewis Ranieri, vice-chairman of Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;I don't believe . . . we are embarked on a cyclical rise in rates.&quot;    But Ronald G. Keenan, vice president of mortgage-backed securities trading for Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp., isn't betting that rates will go down. &quot;This isn't short-lived,&quot; he says, &quot;for the very fundamental reason that the market has determined that the next change in rates is not going to be down, but up.&quot;    ---                 SOARING MORTGAGE RATES   Net yields required by the Federal Home Loan MortgageCorp. Rates quoted to consumers will be one-quarter toone-half of a percentage point higher.                           15-year       30-year         April 13           9.72%        10.14%         April 6            8.95          9.22         March 30           8.70          9.00         March 23           8.23          8.78         March 16           8.54          8.78</TEXT></DOC>
