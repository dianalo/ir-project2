The September contract on the New York Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange rose $59 a metric ton to $2,006. This represents a gain of more than $100 in just three trading days and more than $150 in the past eight trading days.    &quot;In addition to the dry weather, the 75,000 tons of cocoa the manager of the buffer stock of the International Cocoa Agreement has purchased so far may also be having an impact for the first time,&quot; said William O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc. in New York. According to some estimates, that amount approximates this year's production surplus.    West Africa -- particularly the Ivory Coast and Ghana, the largest and third-largest cocoa producers in the world, respectively -- has received only about 50% of its normal rainfall this year.    &quot;Last year we had a similar situation, when the Ivory Coast and Ghana only received about half their normal rain&quot; in May and June, usually the rainiest months in West Africa, said Debra Tropp, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.    However, she noted, rains came in late July and lasted through September -- helping produce a record crop of 590,000 metric tons in the Ivory Coast in the 1986-87 season that began Oct. 1. The previous season 580,000 tons were produced.    A metric ton is equal to 1.1 U.S. short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds.    However, there may be a long-term effect from the current drought, Miss Tropp said. The dry weather could keep &quot;the pods of the 1987-88 crop from forming properly,&quot; she said.    Meanwhile, in the Bahia region of Brazil, the world's second-largest cocoa-producing country, dry conditions in January have delayed the temporao cocoa crop, Miss Tropp said. Although the harvest normally begins in April, it was pushed back until this month.    That is expected to reduce the output to between 1.4 million and 1.5 million bags of 132 pounds each, down from 2.8 million bags last year, Miss Tropp said.    Peter Leavitt, vice president of Weather Services Inc. in Bedford, Mass., said the weather problems in cocoa-producing areas can be traced to &quot;El Nino,&quot; a phenomenon in which the Pacific Ocean's surface temperatures off the southwestern coast of South America warm up, disrupting weather throughout the tropical belt around the world.    &quot;It doesn't affect weather much outside the tropics, but it raises havoc with fishing off the west coast of South America and weather in many countries, as far away as Africa and the Philippines,&quot; Mr. Leavitt said.    El Nino doesn't occur in specific cycles but in periods varying from every four to every 10 years, he said. &quot;When there is an El Nino, Ivory Coast cocoa production tends to be poor,&quot; he said. &quot;When there is no El Nino, Ivory Coast production is good.&quot;    Last year, there was no El Nino, Mr. Leavitt said. &quot;At the moment, we are having a moderate El Nino, which does not bode well for West African cocoa output,&quot; he said.    And a repetition of last year's late rains in the Ivory Coast can't be expected, Mr. Leavitt said. That was a freak occurrence for which there is no real explanation, he said.    &quot;The usual pattern in West Africa is that the weather usually continues the way it begins,&quot; he said. &quot;If it begins rainy, it will be a rainy season; if it begins dry, it stays dry.&quot;    In other futures markets yesterday:    ENERGY: Most oil futures prices eased amid profit-taking, as some traders liquidated their long, or buying, positions ahead of today's meeting of the oil cartel. Market specialists expect the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to maintain its official price of about $18 a barrel and boost member output quotas for the third and fourth quarters, as outlined in its December agreement. Recent oil-price increases were tied to expectations that the cartel would raise its official price, some traders and analysts said. &quot;There had been a false bullishness in the market based on OPEC nervousness,&quot; said Eric Bolling, vice president, futures and options, at Geldermann Inc. in New York. &quot;Now we're having a fundamental correction back to the equilibrium price&quot; for crude oil. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, August crude fell 17 cents a barrel to $19.40. July heating oil fell 0.35 cent a gallon to 50.86 cents, and July unleaded gasoline edged up 0.05 cent a gallon to 54.28 cents. Some of the weakness in crude and the relative strength of gasoline prices was attributable to weekly oil-inventory data released by an industry group after the market closed Tuesday, traders said. The American Petroleum Institute reported increases in U.S. crude and distillate inventories and a decline in gasoline inventories for the week ended Friday.    INTEREST RATES: Treasury bond futures prices closed near their lows for the day amid profit-taking by traders concerned about the outlook for the dollar. Depressing prices in the foreign currency as well as fixed income markets was a news service report early in the day that quoted an unidentified Bank of Japan official as saying the dollar's rebound wasn't sustainable in light of the worsening U.S. trade imbalance between Japan and the U.S., said Jeffrey Priest, head taxable fixed-income securities trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch andamp; Co. in New York. However, the outlook for Treasury bond futures should improve today as the Treasury Department's scheduled auction of $7 billion of seven-year notes is likely to attract interest from foreign investors, traders said.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Most cattle futures prices closed lower, while hog prices were mixed. Traders in both pits exercised caution, awaiting next Tuesday's release of livestock population reports, said Gerald Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. The Agriculture Department is scheduled to release a national cattle inventory report, as well as a hog and pig report. The cattle inventory report -- which should show drops in the number of animals on farms and in the 1987 calf crop, is expected to be bullish for the long-term, Mr. Abbenhaus said. He estimates the hog and pig report will show that the industry is in the midst of an expansion, with a 7% increase in the total number of hogs on farms as of June 1, compared with a year earlier. Farrowing intentions, or births, for the fall pig crop should be up 11% from a year earlier. The fall pig crop will be available for slaughter during the first part of next year. Pork belly futures were also mixed yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
