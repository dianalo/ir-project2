Rafsanjani, in remarks carried later by the news agency, alsosaid Tehran will work for the release of Western hostages if theUnited States adopts a more friendly stance toward the Islamicrepublic.   The agency said he made the remarks during a meeting with ForeignMinister Yaqoub Khan of Pakistan.   ``We condemn hostage-taking and have many times declared this,but we know that some of the people who resort to these things outof innocence and because they have no other recourse, have no otherway to defend themselves,'' he said.   Rafsanjani has emerged as Iran's new strongman following the June3 death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, architect of the 1979revolution that toppled the monarchy.   Elected president in a landslide vote July 28, Rafsanjani isviewed as eager to build ties with the West to gain technology andfinancing to rebuild the country's economy, shattered after eightyears of war with Iraq.   Rafsanjani succeeds Ali Khamenei, a Rafsanjani ally who waspicked to succeed Khomeini as Iran's spiritual leader.   Khomeini's son, Ahmad, today rejected any possible relationsbetween Tehran and Washington. He also dismissed speculation thatIranian authorities had been indirectly in contact with U.S.officials to discuss the release of 16 Western hostages, includingeight Americans, held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.   Tehran radio quoted Khomeini, 43, as saying Iranian officialswill ``punch America in the face, and they will kick America out ofthe Middle East.''   The younger Khomeini holds no official position in Iran. He hasaligned himself with the hard-line elements of the government, butis more a symbol now that his role as his father's spokesman is gone.   Rafsanjani made no mention of the hostages in his remarks duringtoday's ceremony. Previous reports indicated that he was sworn intooffice on Aug. 3, but Iranian media subsequently characterized thatevent as a religious ceremony confirming his victory.   The former speaker of the Majlis, or parliament, said his firstgoal in office would be to get the nation's factories working and,in a veiled warning to his radical opponents, said a policy ofpolitical autonomy was meaningless if the people are hungry.   Rafsanjani acknowledged a fight was brewing over his Cabinetappointments, with some current ministers refusing to serve in hisgovernment.   Rafsanjani did not specifically name the hard-line oppositionheaded by former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, who supportcentral control over the economy and keeping Islamic revolutionaryfervor sharp by challenging the West.   ``We have a constitution, we make a pledge to implement it butnot just one aspect of it, like guarding our borders and politicalindependence. We must secure economic independence too,'' Rafsanjanisaid.   Iran's leaders have maintained a public front of unity since thedeath of Khomeini.   Speeches are tempered with references to following hisguidelines, but the tug of war expected after Khomeini's death isemerging.   ``I certainly do not intend to choose or reject this or thatperson on political or factional grounds,'' Rafsanjani said.   He said some current ministers had refused to join hisadministration, but said he would try to make use of them in somecapacity.   On Wednesday, parliament elected a radical, anti-Western clericto succeed Rafsanjani as speaker rather than his choice, formerInterior Minister Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.   Mehdi Karrubi, a 51-year-old middle ranking cleric and deputyspeaker under Rafsanjani, won 145 votes from the 243 deputiespresent.   Karrubi is allied to Rafsanjani's political rivals, led byMohtashemi, and outgoing Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, whose postwas scrapped in a constitutional reshuffle.   Karrubi's brother, Hassan, was involved with Rafsanjani in secretarms-for-hostages negotiations in 1985 with then-U.S. NationalSecurity Adviser Robert McFarlane.</TEXT></DOC>
