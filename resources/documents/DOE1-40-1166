Air cooled microwave applicatorsintracavitary and interstitial antennae operating at 915 or 300 MHz wereused in various sites. Temperatures were measured by micro-thermocouples.Minimum tumor temperatures of 42{sup 0}C were maintained at 1 hour, twiceweekly. Treatment included a radiation dose of 1600-1700 rads. Tumorresponse was 94% with 60% or more total response. Frequency and durationof total responses depended mainly on the radiation dose. Skin tumors,melanomas, chest wall recurrences responded better than head and neckor intrapelvic recurrences. Side effects observed were minor burns; proctitisor oesophagitis with intracavitary devices; ulcerations or fistulae dueto rapid tumor regression; 4 cases of pleuritis treating chest wall.Overall toxicity was less than 5%. In conclusion: 1) Combination heat-lowdose radiation offers good palliation. 2) Response depends on radiationdose. 3) Combination of full dose radiation therapy plus hyperthermiaproves to be well tolerated.</TEXT></DOC>
