Some big New York arbitrage funds indicate that they have earned 40% or more so far in 1987 -- before management fees that sharply reduce the return to investors. These funds invest mainly in takeover stocks, buying big positions after bids are announced. New funds are forming, and existing ones are attracting more money from investors.    &quot;The business has definitely turned around,&quot; Arnold Amster, a partner in the arbitrage firm of Lafer Amster andamp; Co., says. &quot;We've had a much better environment the past four months.&quot;    Merger activity has heated up, arbitragers say, and corporate restructurings such as that of Allegis Corp. have proved especially lucrative.    Most private arbitrage firms welcome outside investors, at a price. Minimum investments are steep, ranging from $150,000 to $10 million. Under U.S. regulations, each partnership is usually limited to 100 investors. Most are even smaller. One New York firm says it has deliberately raised its minimum the past few years to avoid being deluged by would-be investors.    Arbitrage management isn't cheap, either. Managing partners keep 20% to 40% of profits before distributing the rest to investors. In boom years, that fee can be as much as 10 times the flat rates that conventional money managers charge. Some fees used to be even higher: Mr. Boesky kept 48% of profits in his final fund.    But when things go right, arbitrage funds can boast big returns. Plaza Securities Co., an arbitrage fund led by New York investor Asher Edelman, says it has returned more than 22% to investors in five of the past six years. In its best year, 1982, the fund earned 61.8% before fees, with outside investors getting a 35.5% return.    Of course, arbitrage remains highly risky. Last November, for example, arbitragers had several hundred million dollars of losses when expected bids for Gillette Co. and Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. fell through, sending those stocks plunging. Plaza's latest offering document lists three pages of hazards and warns prospective investors that &quot;losses may occur from time to time.&quot;    The insider-trading scandals have caused jitters among arbitragers, too. Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. has disbanded its arbitrage department as part of a settlement of insider-trading charges, and independent arbitragers go to great lengths to explain that they trade strictly on announced takeovers and don't try to act on rumors.    Arbitragers estimate that their profession's total &quot;buying power,&quot; which was as high as $15 billion while Mr. Boesky still operated, had shrunk to about $10 billion by the end of 1986.    But that figure is believed to be increasing again. In New York, independent arbitrager Paul Sonz is among several starting a new fund. Established arbitrage players such as Kellner, DiLeo andamp; Co. and Oppenheimer andamp; Co. decline to comment on any recent fund-raising. Still, one arbitrager says, &quot;It's been a great time for investing, and a pretty good time for marketing.&quot;    Investors in an arbitrage partnership should hope any boom is long-lasting. Unlike most money managers, who allow withdrawals on short notice, most arbitrage partnerships &quot;lock up&quot; investors' contributions for a year. And some funds charge higher fees if money is left in for less than three years.    GROWING INTEREST: John Nuveen andamp; Co. aims to increase its giant closed-end municipal bond fund. Nuveen and Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc., co-managers of the $1.5 billion fund, are offering underwriters an option to buy an additional 22.5 million shares to cover overallotments, according to a Nuveen spokesman.    The Nuveen Municipal Value Trust Inc. offering could reach $1.73 billion, a record for any initial public offering. Strong retail demand is cited as the reason for the increase. So far, the Nuveen fund's shares have held at their initial price of $10.    Knowledge that the Nuveen fund will be an active purchaser of municipal bonds has &quot;had a positive effect&quot; on tax-exempt bond prices, Damon Smith, a managing director at Dillon Read andamp; Co., said. But the most immediate winners are the underwriters. Their fees will total 6.5% of the offering price, or $97.5 million to $112 million.    ---   Money Fund Assets Fall   NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's 384 money market funds dropped $702.4 million to $235.75 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade association, said. It was the third drop in a row.    &quot;Continued improvement in securities markets during the past week may have prompted some investors to move dollars from general purpose and broker-dealer funds into stocks or bond and income funds,&quot; Ann Anderson, assistant vice president, research, at the institute, said.    Assets of 199 general purpose funds fell $728.7 million to $67.46 billion, and assets of 90 broker-dealer funds fell $310.7 million to $104.51 billion, while assets of 95 institutional funds rose $337 million to $63.78 billion.    The average seven-day yield for funds in the week ended Tuesday rose to 6.01% from 5.97% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. The average 30-day yield rose to 5.93% from 5.88%. The average maturity of funds remained at 44 days.    Banks, which compete with money funds, were paying an average yield of 5.35% on money market savings accounts in the week ended Wednesday, compared with 5.32% the week before, according to Banxquote Online, a New York-based information service. Bank yields were 6.54% on six-month savings certificates of deposit, compared with 6.57% the previous week, and 7.02% for one-year bank savings CDs, compared with 7.05%. </TEXT></DOC>
