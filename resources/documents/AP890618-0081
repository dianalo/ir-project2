Preliminary results from all 12 countries of the EuropeanEconomic Community indicated the number of socialist deputies willincrease from 166 to 192 in the 518-seat body based in Strasbourg,France.   Although it is still mainly a consultative body, the Parliamentcould play a major role in the trading bloc's efforts to forge asingle borderless market by late 1992.   Voters in Belgium, West Germany, Greece, France, Luxembourg,Italy and Portugal cast their ballots Sunday. Elections took placeThursday in the other EEC nations _ Ireland, Britain, Denmark, Spainand the Netherlands.   Final results involving all 7,126 candidates from 178 nationalpolitical parties were not expected to be announced until lateMonday.   Each country elected its own deputies to the Parliament.   News media projections, preliminary EEC reports and exit pollsgave this partial indication of the composition of the newlegislatures:   Greens and other environmentalist parties are among thesignificant gainers after the socialists, winning 18 more seats fora total 38.   Communist parties were losing eight of their 48 seats, but analliance of socialists, environmentalists and communists wouldcontrol a majority with 270 deputies.   Although many of the gains were made at the expense ofconservatives, extreme right-wing parties in France and West Germanyfared well. West Germany's Republican Party was expected to enterthe Parliament for the first time with seven seats. France'sNational Front was holding on to its 10 seats.   Projections showed British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher'sConservatives dropping from 45 seats to 26 while the oppositionLabor Party would increase its number of deputies from 32 to 51.   The EEC, or Common Market, used a staggered system of reportingresults based on poll-closing times in the various countries.Results of the balloting in Thursday's elections were withheldpending the elections Sunday.   Results were tabulated for all of Britain except NorthernIreland. The returns from that British province were not to bereleased until midday Monday along with the outcome of the electionin the republic of Ireland.   The socialists, with 166 seats, were the largest political groupin the previous Parliament.   The Parliament meets one week each month in Strasbourg.   Recent polls have shown many of the 325 million people in the EECcountries consider the Parliament to be little more than a debatingsociety, but reforms adopted in July 1987 give it more power.   It can veto some EEC treaties with other countries, amend orreject the annual budget, fire the 17-member Executive Commissionand delay an opinion on proposed laws, thus preventing them fromtaking effect.   The two other institutions involved in the community's lawmakingprocess are the Executive Commission and Council of Ministers, whichare based in Brussels.</TEXT></DOC>
