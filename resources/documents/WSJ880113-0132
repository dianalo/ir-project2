But they wax enthusiastic when they speak of improving trade and other relations with ideological enemies who are coming to their 1988 Summer Olympics.    The Soviet Union confirmed this week it would participate in the September games in Seoul despite the probability that its ally, Communist North Korea, will boycott them. China, also an ally of North Korea, is sure to come, and &quot;unofficial&quot; trade with Beijing, despite the lack of diplomatic relations, is flourishing.    North Korea announced Monday that it wouldn't meet the Jan. 17 deadline on accepting an invitation to take part in the games. Seoul and the International Olympic Committee have offered to allow the North to stage five of the Olympic events on its territory, but Pyongyang is insisting that it be allowed to host half of all the events scheduled for Seoul.    Seoul has replaced Pyongyang-bashing with a world-wide diplomatic offensive to achieve dominance over the North. South Korea is using the Olympics, its burgeoning economic strength and confidence born out of last month's presidential elections to lengthen a string of foreign-policy gains that have little to do with military might in which North Korea is superior.    &quot;Our prestige and international position is improving greatly,&quot; says Park Soo Gil, a Foreign Ministry official. &quot;Regardless of what North Korea wants, it will gradually be put in a position where it will be forced, bit by bit, to accept peaceful coexistance with us. By the time the Olympics is over, we will enter a new stage in our relations with Communist countries.&quot;    Western diplomats doubt Seoul can establish diplomatic ties soon with North Korea's Communist allies, which depend on the North for strategic position and intelligence gathering in the region. But South Korean officials make clear their aims aren't purely political: They hope North Korea's eroded diplomatic and economic position leaves it no option but to deal more on Seoul's terms. Moreover, Seoul wants to diversify its markets to make itself less vulnerable to possible protectionist moves by the U.S., which buys 40% of Seoul's exports.    Officials like to show off their geopolitical scorecard: South Korea leads the North 128-102 in the number of countries with which it has diplomatic relations. The Foreign Ministry's Mr. Park is effusive when he talks about No. 127, the tiny mountain kingdom of Bhutan; &quot;The North Koreans aren't there at all,&quot; he says. He is happier still about No. 128, the East African nation of Somalia. &quot;They were North Korea's strongest ally in the region.&quot;    He eagerly confirms that &quot;secret&quot; trade with China, carried on indirectly, exceeded $1.5 billion in 1987 and will surpass $2 billion this year. Trade with the Soviet bloc grew by 40% in 1987 to more than $200 million, and Hungary has opened a trade office in Seoul.    U.S. officials see mostly good coming from South Korea's rising foreign profile. Washington hopes Seoul will be a capitalist road map for development in the Third World. Even Vietnamese experts are secretly visiting South Korea to take notes.    &quot;South Korea could be the best example that American aid does pay off in creating influential, Western-minded friends,&quot; says a Western diplomat.    Yet Seoul's international effort to win friends also breeds problems. Seoul is closer to Iran and Libya than Washington would like; South Korean officials maintain that their radical friends really don't engage in terrorism. U.S. officials say they have had to intercede to stop small shipments of South Korean weapons to Iran.    A Korean official says only one such shipment -- mortar-launcher parts being sent to Iran that a South Korean company says it thought were destined for Spain -- was stopped after U.S. intercession. &quot;They cooperate fully when we know about something,&quot; says an official in Washington, &quot;but we suspect they aren't too troubled about what we don't know about.&quot;    Alan Romberg, a former State Department official now at the Council on Foreign Relations, says, &quot;As South Korea gains in independence and prestige, some natural differences (with the U.S.) will arise, but that won't qualitatively harm the overall relationship.&quot; Mr. Romberg says that U.S.-South Korean cooperation in the region instead will grow as Seoul becomes more important economically, politically and perhaps also militarily.    South Korea has invested heavily in pursuing diplomatic gains in the Third World, where it hopes to find new markets and a base for political influence among non-aligned countries. It uses a $10.5 million annual grant program to train Third World students in Korea and to send instructors abroad to teach disciplines ranging from computer science to karate.    The government last year established a $70 million Overseas Cooperation Fund, government-insured loans similar to U.S. Export-Import Bank financing. The amount increases to $120 million this year and to between $360 million and $500 million by 1992. The money already has been used for such projects as co-production of television sets with Indonesia and Malaysia, Korean officials say.    A key South Korean target is the Moslem world. More than 40,000 Koreans work on projects in the Middle East and North Africa, primarily in rich Persian Gulf states. More than 6,000 Koreans work in Libya alone, and the Dong Ah construction company is working on a $3.3 billion project to build a 1,500-mile water pipeline in that country. Korea plays both sides of the Persian Gulf conflict, with workers in Iran and Iraq.    But China holds the most political and economic allure. Korean optimism grew after the December elections, when new Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said he would help contacts between Seoul and Beijing. President-elect Roh Tae Woo wants to develop an economic zone in Cholla province that could grow rich off Chinese trade. This might soothe the resentment of people in this southwest part of the country who feel they have been left out of Korea's economic miracle.    Korean businessmen are confident they will be able to take much of the Japanese-Chinese trade in time. &quot;The Chinese hate the Japanese,&quot; says one business executive. &quot;They will come to us if we offer the same goods at the same price.&quot;    Park Seh Jik, Seoul's Olympic Committee chairman, says the wooing of China began with the Asian Games in 1986 and will accelerate after the Olympics, when Beijing is likely to open a trade office here. &quot;Remember, relations between the U.S. started with pingpong,&quot; he says. &quot;We are already beyond pingpong.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
