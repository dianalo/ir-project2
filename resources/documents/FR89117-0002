Best, Flight ProceduresStandards Branch (AFS-420), Air Transportation Division, Flight StandardsService, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue SW.,Washington, DC 20591; telephone (202) 267-8277.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This amendment to Part 95 of the FederalAviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 95) prescribes new, amended, suspended,or revoked IFR altitudes governing the operation of all aircraft in IFRflight over a specified route or any portion of that route, as well asthe changeover points (COPs) for Federal airways, jet routes, or directroutes as prescribed in Part 95. The specified IFR altitudes, when usedin conjunction with the prescribed changeover points for those routes,ensure navigation aid coverage that is adequate for safe flight operationsand free of frequency interference. The reasons and circumstances whichcreate the need for this amendment involve matters of flight safety, operationalefficiency in the National Airspace System, and are related to publishedaeronautical charts that are essential to the user and provide for thesafe and efficient use of the navigable airspace. In addition, those variousreasons or circumstances require making this amendment effective beforethe next scheduled charting and publication date of the flight informationto assure its timely availability to the user. The effective date of thisamendment reflects those considerations. In view of the close and immediaterelationship between these regulatory changes and safety in air commerce,I find that notice and public procedure before adopting this amendmentis unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest andthat good cause exists for making the amendment effective in less than30 days.The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifiesthat this amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 95</ITAG>Aircraft, Airspace.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC on January 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert L.
