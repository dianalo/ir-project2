Box 449, Helper, Utah 84526 has filed anamendment to a petition for modification. On April 3, 1988, Castle GateCoal Company, submitted a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR75.503 (permissable electric face equipment) to its Mine No. 3 (I.D. No.42-00165) located in Carbon County, Utah. On June 1, 1988, MSHA publishednotice of the petition in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 20029), allowing interested parties 30days to submit comments. On July 26, 1988, petitioner submitted a requestto amend the originally submitted petition for modification. The amendmentis filed under section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Actof 1977.A summary of the petitioner's statements follows:1. The petition concerns the requirement that trailing cables be 500 feet.2. Development in the 10th East panel will be by means of a three-entrysystem with crosscuts and entries on 104-foot by 140-foot centers and 140-footby 100-foot centers. The size of the coal blocks is required due to thegeological characteristics of the property. The size of the coal blocksrequires the use of either longer trailing cables or distribution boxes.Longer trailing cables would be more easily protected from mechanical damagethan distribution boxes. Distribution boxes are difficult to protect dueto 16-foot-wide entries dictated by roof conditions and due to pitchedseam and water problems.3. As an alternate method, petitioner proposes to use 800 feet of No. 6AWG trailing cables on shuttle cars and 650 feet of No. 6 AWG trailingcables on roof bolting machines.4. Petitioner states that increasing the length of the shuttle car cablesto 800 feet, and increasing the length of the roof bolter cables to 650feet would eliminate the need for backspooling and the addition of junctionboxes. Backspooling causes undue wear and damage to the trailing cablewhich results in premature failure and/or breakdown of the cable. Thiscable damage creates a greater potential for fire and shock hazards tooccur. Elimination of junction boxes reduces required system maintenanceand also eliminates another potential sources of fire and shock hazards.5. Petitioner further states that no voltage-drop, motor overheating, droppingout of contractors, or starting problems due to low-voltage have been encounteredwith the machines.6. Petitioner states that the proposed alternate method will provide thesame degree of safety for the miners affected as that afforded by the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>Persons interested in this amendment to the petition for modification mayfurnish written comments.
