The decision was reached Sunday after a series of meetings withunion leaders from IP mills across the country, said Robert Frase,executive assistant to UPIU president Wayne Glenn in Nashville,Tenn.   The company was informed by telegram Sunday, he said.   International Paper had continued to run its mills withreplacement workers. It boasted that production was nearly atpre-strike levels, and insisted the non-union employees are thereto stay.   Elections are pending to decertify the UPIU and theInternational Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers as bargainingagents for mill employees. Once the strike was a year old, only thereplacement workers were eligible to vote.   A small number of Firemen and Oilers are included in thedecision to end the strike.   Frase said ending the strike was a strategic move that willforce IP to rehire strikers when openings occur.   ``The decision was made by the rank and file, by their electedleaders,'' he said.   ``No one twisted their arms or put a gun to their heads,'' Frasesaid.   More than 1,200 members of the UPIU and the IBFO walked out inJay in June 1987 in a contract dispute over premium pay for work onSundays and holidays and IP's demand for looser work rules. Thecompany has continued to run the mill with non-union replacementworkers.   Since the walkout began, this once-sleepy western Maine town hasseen boisterous rallies and marches and a court order to curbname-calling, vandalism and occasional violence on the picket lines.   Mill spokesman Richard White said today that IP intends to keepthe replacements and said the mill was currently ``at fullcomplement.'' Still, he acknowledged that strikers will now belegally entitled to first preference for any job openings, which hesaid occur at average of three per week.   ``As openings occur, we will welcome workers who have been onstrike who qualify for those openings,'' he said.   The mood was somber this morning at union headquarters, where asign out front urged the strikers to ``Stand Tall. We Will All GoBack Together.'' Inside, scores of union members milled about.   ``It's not that we don't want to fight _ it's just that wecan't. We have nothing to fight with,'' said one striker, RolandSamson.   Felix Jacques, executive vice president of the local, said UPIUlawyers would explain the implications of the action in detail at aunion meeting in Jay on Wednesday night but that essentially itwould entitle the strikers to any jobs that become available at themill.   ``By law, they cannot hire any permanent replacements as oftoday,'' Jacques said.   Frase maintained that the walkouts at the Jay mill, as well asat IP mills in Depere, Wis., and Lock Haven, Pa., had successfullysent IP and other paper companies the message that such disputesare `'something that's not going to be won easily.'' However, herefused to concede defeat for the union.   ``Just because the strike is over doesn't mean the conflict hasended,'' he said.   The paperworkers union had sought to consolidate the strikes atthe three mills, as well as a lockout at the IP mill in Mobile,Ala., where today's action by the union has no direct impact.</TEXT></DOC>
