The Commerce Department said residents of the Southwest posted a5.3 percent increase in income to $14,350 for every adult and childin 1988, compared with a 3.0 percent increase in 1987.   At the same time, residents of the Rocky Mountain region postedaverage earnings of $14,363, up 5.5 percent compared to 4.0 percenta year earlier, and those living in the Great Lakes region earned anaverage $16,239, up 6.6 percent compared to 5.6 percent in 1987.   For the nation as a whole, incomes averaged $16,489, up 6.6percent compared to an increase of 6.0 percent in 1987. The revisedfigures show that income growth in the United States was a bitstronger than first reported four months ago. The original reportput national per capita incomes at $16,444, a 6.2 percent increase.   ``The `oil patch' Southwest and Rocky Mountain areas benefitedfrom rebounds in industries hard hit by the 1986 decline in oilprices, and the Great Lakes region benefited from a surge inmanufacturing payrolls,'' the report said.   For the Southwest and Rocky Mountain regions, the per capitaincreases reflected faster growth in total personal income combinedwith slower population growth in 1988 than in 1987. Per capitaincome in the Great Lakes region also resulted from faster growth inincome, although population growth remained the same in both years.   Despite the acceleration in incomes, residents of heartlandAmerica continued to earn less than those living along some areas ofthe East and West Coasts.   The top regions were New England, with an 8.4 percent increase to$20,191; the Mideast, up 7.6 percent to $18,959, and the Far West,up 5.7 percent to $18,138.   Top average incomes were posted by residents of Connecticut whoearned $23,059 per capita in 1988, an increase of 8.5 percentcompared to an 8.6 percent hike a year earlier.   Also in the top 10 were New Jersey, up 8.5 percent to $21,994;Massachusett, up 8.8 percent to $20,816; Maryland, up 7.0 percent to$19,487; New Hampshire, up 7.5 percent to $19,434; New York, up 7.6percent to $19,305; Alaska, up 3.3 percent to $19,079; California,up 5.5 percent to $18,753; Virginia, up 6.9 percent to $17,675, andDelaware, up 8.3 percent to $17,661.   Mississippi ranked at the bottom of the list with a per capitaincome of $11,116, a 7.9 percent increase over the previous year.   Also at the bottom of te list were: West Virginia, up 6.6 percentto $11,735; Utah, up 5.8 percent to $12,193; Arkansas, up 7.0percent to $12,219; Louisiana, up 6.8 percent to $12,292; NewMexico, up 5.0 percent to $12,488; Idaho, up 7.4 percent to $12,665;South Dakota, up 2.7 percent to $12,755; Kentucky, up 6.9 percent to$12,822; North Dakota, up 0.1 percent to $12,833, and Alabama, up6.7 percent to $12,851.   The department defines personal income as income received byindividuals and certain non-profit institutions from all sourcesbefore individual Social Security taxes, including Social Securitypayments and other transfer payments, interest, dividends andprofits from farms and other unincorporated businesses, withestimates for cash equivalents of certain non-cash items such asfood produced and consumed on farms and the rental value ofowner-occupied homes.</TEXT></DOC>
