The bubble is the excess of the nation's natural-gas supply over demand. The surplus is currently estimated at two to three trillion cubic feet of gas, or 12% to 18% above annual U.S. demand of about 17 trillion cubic feet.    Many industry sources say the excess supply already is shrinking and will disappear in one or two years. Some even see shortages developing.    That will mean higher natural gas prices for industry and individuals. But it also will mean increased drilling, especially in the economically distressed Southwest.    The primary reason for the shrinking excess, the sources say, is a five-year decline in drilling caused by a drop in oil and gas prices. The number of active drilling rigs, which peaked at 4,530 in December 1981, dropped to fewer than 700 this summer before rising to just over 900 currently. Many oil and gas producers say that, unless prices rise, there will be little or no further increases in drilling next year.    Industry sources also point to new market opportunities for gas that may boost demand, such as gas-fired cogeneration facilities that simultaneously produce electricity and steam from a single fuel source.    Moreover, there is considerable concern that some gas wells in the Gulf of Mexico will run dry soon, said Gamble Baldwin, a gas pipeline analyst at First Boston Corp. Those wells contribute about 30% of the U.S. supply.    To be sure, the forecasts of a shrinking gas surplus could be wrong. Mr. Baldwin said increased gas imports from Canada and Algeria could boost overall U.S. supplies. Moreover, most analysts agree that the winter weather will play a major role. For example, after three straight warm winters, Brooklyn Union Gas Co., a New York utility, is starting this winter with half of the gas it will need already in storage. A cold winter, analysts say, could lop off about 500 billion cubic feet of the gas surplus.    A survey of energy companies by Salomon Brothers Inc. indicates a shrinking gas surplus. Polled by Salomon on their 1987 drilling plans, most of the 50 or so companies that have responded said they expect supply and demand to be in &quot;equilibrium&quot; by next winter. Equilibrium, explained James D. Carroll, a Salomon oil-services analyst, denotes a 7% to 8% surplus of gas.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., in a recently issued report, predicted that the &quot;acute reduction&quot; in drilling will continue through 1987, resulting in a &quot;fully balanced&quot; gas market in 1988.    In Houston, Ted Davis, general manager of the natural-gas department at Du Pont Co.'s Conoco Inc. subsidiary, said, &quot;We're going to see severe declines&quot; in the amount of gas available for delivery. Conoco reduced its oil and gas exploration by 50% this year. It even held some gas off the spot market because prices have fallen below Conoco's cost to develop new gas reserves.    Some analysts and industry officials see possible shortages. &quot;Beginning in 1989 at the latest, U.S. gas supplies will be insufficient to meet demand,&quot; predicted Purvin andamp; Gertz Inc., a Houston-based energy consulting firm. Meanwhile, Raymond Plank, chairman of Denver-based Apache Corp., an oil and gas exploration concern, said, &quot;We could have significant (supply) problems (as early as) next winter.&quot;    The surplus began forming about five years ago, after the U.S. government's partial decontrol of gas prices and increased demand had produced higher prices and more drilling activity.    However, as demand declined from a peak of more than 20 trillion cubic feet, gas prices paid to producers fell as much as 50% in the past five years, with this year's oil-price collapse accelerating the fall in gas prices. Caught in a cash-flow squeeze, many producers have been forced to close wells.    The gas surplus also has hurt pipeline companies, which in many cases were forced to buy high-priced gas they didn't need under old contracts. In addition, utilities and gas distributors began to reduce pipeline deliveries.    While gas supplies are now starting to dwindle, new markets for gas are emerging, which could boost demand. The biggest new market is gas-fired cogeneration facilities, which are far more efficient producers of electricity than traditional power plants.    Robert Steinke, vice president, fuel supply, for Public Service Electric andamp; Gas Co., Newark, N.J., said dozens of new gas-fired cogeneration plants are about to come on line in New Jersey. They will increase PSEandamp;G customers' demand for gas about 10% over the next two years, he said.    Other new markets include gas-powered cooling equipment and small-scale electric power plants. Such new business should &quot;put a good dent in the bubble,&quot; said Michael Germain, an analyst with the American Gas Association, a distributors' trade group.    Whether next winter brings equilibrium or shortages, this much seems clear: Gas prices will go up and the spate of windfalls customers have recently gotten will cease.    &quot;No question about it, we're going to see an increase in rates,&quot; said John Fick, manager of supply, planning and energy affairs for Southern California Gas Co., a Los Angeles utility. He added that he doesn't know how much of an increase to expect. And Mr. Steinke of PSEandamp;G, which recently had a $180 million gas-rate cut, said, &quot;The give-backs will end.&quot;    In the spot market, where 35% of all natural gas is sold, prices have already moved up a little. The Natural Gas Clearinghouse, a Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. unit, reported that November spot prices generally showed a five-cent increase over October, ranging from $1.30 to $1.50 a thousand cubic feet.    While most of the U.S. might not like the bubble-popping, some energy-based states will. Mr. Carroll of Salomon Brothers said there has been a healthy gain in the number of drilling permits issued for wells from 10,000 to 15,000 feet, typical drilling depths for gas prospects. &quot;Just recently, we've seen a pickup in gas-well drilling&quot; in Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana, he said. If the gas surplus vanishes, prices will rise, spurring further drilling. </TEXT></DOC>
