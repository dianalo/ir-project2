Allowed To Buy Into Foreign Cable</HEAD><DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pacific Telesis is eager to invest inJapan's $1 billion long-distance market now that it's become thefirst ``Baby Bell'' to be allowed to tap into a major foreigntelecommunications venture.   ``We've been working for more than two years to gain thisfoothold,'' said Lee Cox, president and chief executive of PacTelCorp., which heads San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group'sunregulated operations.   Cox made his comment Monday after a federal judge in Washington,D.C., cleared PacTel to take a stake of up to 10 percent of aJapanese-led consortium that will own and operate a fiber-opticcable between the United States and Japan.   At the same time, U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene refused arequest by Nynex Corp., another Baby Bell, to take a 50 percentstake in a trans-Atlantic fiber-optic cable with Great Britain'sCable and Wireless Co.   The approval of PacTel's request marks the first time sinceGreene's 1984 order to break up the American Telephone and TelegraphCo. that one of the seven regional phone companies has beenpermitted to invest in a major foreign telecommunications operation.   American companies, supported by arguments by U.S. trade policyrepresentatives, have aggressively sought entrance into Japan'stelecommunications industry for the past decade.   The Japanese overseas telephone market makes $1 billion worth ofcalls a year and is growing annually by 20 percent.   PacTel needed judicial approval because of concerns overantitrust violations. The ATandamp;T breakup barred the regional companiesfrom entering the long-distance telephone business.   The trans-Pacific cable would run from Honshu in Japan, toAlaska, and then to Pacific City, Ore., and is scheduled forcompletion by the end of next year.   Greene, who said he based his ruling on the commercial and tradepolicy implications of the case, dismissed objections raised by ATandamp;Tand MCI Telecommiunications Corp., which argued that PacTel'sventure would constitute an antitrust abuse of its monopoly statusas a local telephone utility.   Writing that the investment ``serves positive Americanpurposes,'' Greene added that without PacTel's investment, theUnited States ``could also lose a long-term opportunity to influencepolicies that could open more Japanese markets.''   Greene's order said he was permitting the Pacific Telesisinvestment because the company would only take part in the Japaneseend of the project and could not exercise monopoly power over thelines in this country.   He said Nynex had failed to show ``that there is no substantialpossibility that it could use its monopoly power to impedecompetition in the market it seeks to enter.''   Unlike PacTel, Nynex would have been responsible for marketingthe services of its venture in the United States.   Greene said PacTel's lack of marketing involvement made it``difficult for PacTel to discriminate in favor of its trans-Pacificcustomers inasmuch as it could not communicate the necessaryinformation directly to such customers.''   The consortium is to be named International Digital Co. Inc. andPacTel will have one seat on its board of directors, to be based inJapan.   Cox said PacTel's option to be part of the venture would haveexpired Feb. 23.</TEXT></DOC>
