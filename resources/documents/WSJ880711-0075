It wasn't immediately clear to what extent the scheme was successful, but the bank said it has dispersed no funds so far, and foresees no impact on earnings as a result of the alleged fraud. The official, Haitian national Max Buteau, resigned from his position as vice president in late June, a Bank of Boston spokesman said. He declined to give details of Mr. Buteau's former duties. Mr. Buteau is in police custody in London.    Alan McKinnon, the bank's chief financial officer, said that on the strength of the guarantees authorized by Mr. Buteau, payments by other banks or parties may have already been made. He declined to give a figure for these payments, or the parties that made them or received them, but said that they were much less than the $22.9 million total.    In court Friday, British police said the guarantees were made to corporations and individuals outside Britain. The police named Tina Jeffe, a French doctor, as a co-conspirator with Mr. Buteau, according to reports in the British Press Association.    Mr. McKinnon said, however, that so far, Bank of Boston hasn't been called on to make good on its guarantees. One of the guarantees was for $10.3 million, and another was for #7,383,500 ($8.7 million).    Bank of Boston may have a legal obligation to pay on the guarantees if parties that have already made payments wind up taking losses. But Mr. McKinnon said the amount of the bank's possible losses would be covered both by insurance and by reserves already set aside for fraud contingencies. </TEXT></DOC>
