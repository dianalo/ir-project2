The government on Sunday ordered the arrests of Fang and hiswife, Li Shuxian, an assistant professor at Beijing University, forwhat authorities said were counterrevolutionary activities.   The two prominent dissidents sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy inBeijing after the June 4 military attack on students in TiananmenSquare.   In Washington, the Bush administration indicated it would notturn the couple over to Chinese authorities. A U.S. official, whospoke on condition of anonymity, indicated that any attempt toarrest Fang and Li would be resisted.   As a result of the army's assault on unarmed protesters in thesquare, U.S.-Chinese relations have plunged to perhaps the lowestpoint since diplomatic ties were restored a decade ago.   The government-controlled media today accused the Voice ofAmerica, which reported hundreds of deaths in the city center a weekago, of false reporting and distortion. Official media claim no onewas killed on the square.   Authorities have launched a propaganda campaign aimed atconvincing the populace that soldiers were the victims of arampaging mob and that foreign reports of troops opening fire onunarmed crowds are lies.   Official media told people to study senior leader Deng Xiaoping'sspeech Friday that praised the army for crushing the 7-week-old,pro-democracy movement. Deng claimed the movement's leaders intendedto turn communist China into a capitalist republic.   National television repeatedly showed scenes of one man,identified as a leader of an independent labor union in Shanghai,who had apparently been beaten and was being held at gunpoint bypolice.   His face was swollen so badly he could barely open his eyes.   Broadcasts also showed the arrests of dozens of other people,many described as ``thugs'' who took advantage of the movement tocommit crimes during protests that hit more than a dozen Chinesecities.   The propaganda assault and heavy troop presence in Beijing haveended nationwide protests that broke out after the capital wasoccupied by troops.   The Ministry of Public Security announced in a notice read todayon Beijing Radio that: ``All illegal organizations which incite orcreate social disturbances and counterrevolutionary rebellion arebanned.''   It said those leaders who refuse to surrender ``will be arrested,brought to justice and dealt with severely ...''   Many student leaders appear to have gone underground.   Authorities have arrested about 750 people, mainly workers andunemployed youths, in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Wuhan, Lanzhou andGuiyang. There have also been arrests in Xian, Canton, Changsha,Zhengzhou and other cities.   The attacks on the U.S. government-funded VOA intensified todaywith the official Beijing Daily running an editorial that was readon television.   ``VOA really has created too many rumors,'' it said. ``They'vedone enough to add fuel to the flames of the counterrevolutionaryturmoil.''   The editorial continued: ``Beijing is returning to order and thepeople are settling down. VOA also should take a rest.''   The government also criticized the U.S. Embassy for harboringFang and Li.   The official Xinhua News Agency said Fang and his wife werecharged with ``committing crimes of counterrevolutionary propagandaand instigation'' in connection with the pro-democracy protests.   The Foreign Ministry strongly protested the sheltering of Fang,and official media have repeatedly demanded that the outspokencritic of Marxism be turned over to authorities.   China also has lashed out at the United States for banningmilitary sales in China in response to the June 4 assault. TheChinese government says nearly 300 people were killed, mostlysoldiers. However, Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence saidthe toll could be as high as 3,000, most of them civilians.   The only comparable strain on U.S.-Chinese relations since formalties were re-established in 1979 has been the question ofWashington's ties with Taiwan, the Nationalist Chinese-ruled islandBeijing considers a renegade province.   ABC quoted Chinese sources Sunday as saying police arrested RenWanding, a leading dissident and accountant who had written essayscriticizing the Communist government.   Like Fang, Ren did not play a leading role in the recent studentdemonstrations but voiced support for their goals.   The British Foreign Office today said it had asked China'sForeign Ministry to look into the case of a Hong Kong student whowas arrested in Shanghai as he was about to board a flight to gohome to the British colony.   Yao Yongzhan, 19, was in the company of several British studentsand British consulate officials when he was detained at the airport.   Shanghai authorities said Yao headed an independent Shanghaistudent group. In Beijing, foreign reporters must have localgovernment approval to report from all areas under martial law,meaning all of central Beijing.</TEXT></DOC>
