The compounds inhibit the action of substances in the brain called excitatory amino acids. Nova said these substances may be linked to disorders including epilepsy, anxiety and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.    The Baltimore-based company said experiments in animals indicate that the inhibitory compounds it is developing are capable of penetrating the brain. The compounds have yet to be tested in people. </TEXT></DOC>
