Most of the work has to be done through cooperativestudies with management agencies and takes many years to complete. Thus,to address immediate problems, this research has focused on the top ofthe trophic levels, using field data to understand the forces regulatinglarge animal populations. In the current year, work continued on theYellowstone grizzly bear, a species classified as threatened under theEndangered Species Act and impacted by energy development. The researchincludes estimates of abundance and certain essential population parameters,such as reproductive and survival rates. Various kinds of models havebeen used in an effort to assess the available data.</TEXT></DOC>
