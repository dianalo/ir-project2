The small, two-engine 737 is among several aircraft BritishAirways is sizing up as a successor to the BAC 1-11s due to beremoved soon from London's main airports, Heathrow and Gatwick,said the spokesman on condition of anonymity.   The 99-seat BAC 1-11s, manufactured by British AircraftCorporation Ltd., will be transferred to provincial airports, saidthe spokesman.   A decision from top British Airways management on whichreplacement aircraft to purchase is expected soon, the spokesmansaid. Other aircraft under consideration are the British AerospaceBAe-146, the Fokker 100 and the Airbus A320.   ``Historically, we've tended to be a Boeing airline,'' said thespokesman. ``Their aircraft fit the profile we want.''   The spokesman denied a report in London's Times newspaper thatBritish Airways directors had already decided to purchase 35aircraft from the Seattle, Wash., aircraft manufacturer.   The newspaper said British Airways would purchase 25 of the 737sworth more than $750 million and about 10 longer-distance 767medium-sized jets. The 737 aircraft would be from the 300, 400 and500 series, providing between 110 and 160 seats, the story said.   In Seattle, Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman David Jimenezdeclined comment on the report. Boeing's policy is not to discussaircraft sales or negotiations until a customer announces them.   In May, Boeing and Airbus Industrie of Europe split the biggestcommercial aircraft order in history, a 130-plane purchase byInternational Lease Finance Corp. of Beverly Hills, California.   Boeing got the largest part of that contract, selling 100 planesfor $3.69 billion. Among the aircraft were 72 of the 737 series.</TEXT></DOC>
