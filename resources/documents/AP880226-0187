Adminstrators planned to teach classes for 3,600 seniorsstarting Monday if the walkout continued.   The Cleveland Teachers Union went on strike Thursday afterrejecting the school board's latest contract proposal. Negotiationsresumed Friday afternoon under the guidance of a federal mediator.   ``I'm hopeful, and the parties seem resolved to try to make adeal this weekend,'' said Craig M. Brown, the school district'schief negotiator.   Said Richard Farmer, the union's strike coordinator:``We wouldhope they sit at the table until it's resolved. We don't want along strike.''   The district canceled classes Friday because of the strike bythe 5,093-member union. Schools were closed Thursday because of badweather, although other area school systems remained open.   The closure was viewed as an effort by school administrators togive negotiators in marathon talks more time to reach a settlement.   Schools spokesman John M. Hairston said the school board plannedto seek a court order to limit the number of pickets at thedistrict's buildings because of problems Friday. At Lincoln-WestHigh School, pickets prevented adminstrators from entering thebuilding to prepare for classes for seniors at that school Monday,he said.   The school board had offered a three-year package with a 3percent pay raise retroactive to Sept. 1, and 5 percent increasesthe next two years contingent on passage of a tax levy and avoluntary ``career ladder'' in the third year, which would link payraises to performance evaluations.   The school board also offered a one-year contract with a 3percent raise.   Cleveland teacher salaries range from $17,600 to $37,450,depending on education and experience. The average teacher makes$29,000 annually.</TEXT></DOC>
