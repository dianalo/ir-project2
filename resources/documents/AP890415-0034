The Communist Party daily Pravda and the Defense Ministrynewspaper Red Star reported Tbilisi was calm during the day butthat tensions still rose nightly as the 11 p.m. curfew approached.   However, Pravda suggested the 11 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew that wasimposed after Sunday's clash could end soon.   The reports came after the southern republic's Communist Partyand government leaders were replaced following the killings by RedArmy troops who were trying to disperse nationalist protestersSunday.   ``Nobody and nothing can justify the deaths of absolutelyinnocent people,'' Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, anethnic Georgian, said in a speech Friday to Georgia's party plenum,which made the leadership changes.   At a meeting in Moscow, a group of prominent intellectuals,including human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, today blamedthe clash in Tbilisi on Moscow bureaucrats who imposed strongersecurity measures last year.   Decrees approved at the end of July require advance permissionfor meetings and demonstrations and gave a special force attachedto the Interior Ministry special power for keeping order atdemonstrations.   Soviet officials are conducting an investigation to determinewhether security forces who broke up the demonstration in Tbilisikilled people by beating them with shovels they had been issued todig trenches.   The group said the killings in Georgia threaten PresidentMikhail Gorbachev's reforms, known as perestroika.   ``This is a knife pushed into the back of perestroika byhigh-ranking bureaucrats, first and foremost, I believe, by theMoscow ones,'' said one member of the group, economist LeonidBatkin.   Sakharov, a 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner and Tribuna boardmember, sat near Batkin but did not speak.   Mourning Georgians continued piling fresh flowers at the site ofthe clash Sunday outside the local government headquarters inTbilisi. More funerals in the Black Sea republic bordering Turkeywere scheduled today.   Red Star reported new ``calls for people to commit terroristacts.''   ``In a few regions, rocks and bottles have been thrown atmilitary vehicles during the night,'' the paper said.   Shevardnadze, party chief in the southern republic from 1972 to1985 and now a member of the ruling Politburo in Moscow, wasdispatched to Georgia after Sunday's bloodshed.   Givi G. Gumbaridze, Georgia's KGB chief for two months, waselected Friday by the party plenum to succeed Dzhumber I.Patiashvili as party first secretary. Gumbaridze, 45, previouslyserved as party leader in Tbilisi, a city of 1.2 million people.   Patiashvili, 49, who held his post since replacing Shevardnadze,accepted responsibility for the clash and resigned.   Premier Zurab Chkheidze also was removed at a separate meetingof Georgia's Presidium, or top government body, the Tass newsagency reported. Nodari Chitanava, a Central Committee secretary,was named the new head of the republic's government, Tass said.   Patiashvili has said he did not expect fatalities when troopswere ordered to quell Sunday's protest.   Signs posted at Tbilisi State University called Patiashvili a``killer.''   In shaking up their leadership, Georgian party officials werefollowing a pattern set last year in the neighboring republics ofArmenia and Azerbaijan. After four months of nationalist protests,the Armenian and Azerbaijani party chiefs were fired, apparentlyfor their inability to halt unrest.   In the Baltic republics to the north, residents in the Latviancapital Riga and two other cities were startled this week by tanksthat thundered through the area on what military officials calledtraining exercises.   Ten to 20 tanks were reported in Riga on Monday, five in theEstonian city of Tartu on Thursday, and armored personnel carrierswere seen Friday in Tallinn, the Estonian capital.   All three cities have had demonstrations drawing tens ofthousands of people demanding greater autonomy.</TEXT></DOC>
