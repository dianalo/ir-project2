Coal industry leaders recognize that new technology andtighter control of operations will be an absolute necessity to remaincompetitive in the world energy market. The challenge for innovationto achieve greater productivity has never been greater. Automation ishelping meet this challenge by controlling processes and flows in coalpreparation plants, by monitoring mine ventilation and conveyor beltsystems, and by controlling movement of mine production machinery, includinglongwall equipment, to name only a few. To assure continued progressin this area the industry must have professional people to design, manufacture,install and operate this technology. To keep abreast of this ever-changingtechnology, the present professionals on board must continually expandtheir horizons. At the University of Alabama, the latest coal industrycomputer applications were discussed at a conference and this book presentsthe compilation of those papers.</TEXT></DOC>
