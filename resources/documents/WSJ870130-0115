The cost of the two projects wasn't disclosed. Gallium is a metal used in making semiconductors for the electronics industry. Gallium is produced as a byproduct in the smelting of aluminum.    The big aluminum producer said that output from the two Canadian facilities will be sent for further processing at Alcan's gallium refinery at Rorschach, Switzerland. Alcan said the Quebec facility will begin operations by the end of this year, and the Ontario recycling operation will start production next month. </TEXT></DOC>
