Beginning early today, hundreds of artillery shells could beheard falling inside Cambodia. The shelling, which continued intomidday, shook houses in the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet.   Thai military and guerrilla sources said the shelling came fromgovernment positions in response to the guerrilla attacks.   The guerrillas' main objectives were the town of Svay Chek andgovernment-held positions around the village of Nimit, said asenior official of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front inAranyaprathet. He spoke on condition of anonymity.   Western and Thai military observers on the border confirmed thata major attack had begun.   At the Liberation Front's base of Boueng Trakuan, about twomiles inside Cambodia, guerrillas showed off large quantities ofcaptured weapons, including four 122mm artillery pieces, mortars,heavy machine guns, assault rifles and ammunition.   Soviet-built trucks captured from government forces were seencarrying weapons to forward guerrilla positions at Svay Chek about12 miles to the southeast.   More than 1,000 guerrillas attacked Svay Chek, which wasdefended by about 600 government troops, said the guerrilla sourcein Aranyaprathet.   The Liberation Front coordinated the attacks with thenon-Communist guerrilla group loyal to opposition leader PrinceNorodom Sihanouk, the source said. The Sihanoukists attackedgovernment positions at Kok Mon close to the town of Banteay Chamarin the far northwest, he said.   The guerrillas failed to take Svay Chek during their biggestoffensive in 11 years beginning in late September. They did,however, seize the towns of Banteay Chamar, Thmar Puok and Kandoulas well as many villages and other military positions.   Thai military sources, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,said today's attacks were intended to secure those gains in advanceof an anticipated government counteroffensive.   Large concentrations of Communist Khmer Rouge fighters alsooperate in northwestern Cambodia. However, it was unclear how muchof a role they played in the latest attacks.   The Khmer Rouge is the most powerful group in a three-partycoalition fighting the government in Phnom Penh.   The Communist group took over Cambodia in April 1975 and killedor starved hundreds of thousands of people before it was ousted bya Vietnamese invasion 11 years ago. The Vietnamese installed thecurrent Cambodian government.   Vietnam said it withdrew the last of its combat troops in lateSeptember.</TEXT></DOC>
