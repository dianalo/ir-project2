Her family said she died in a hospital in Buckinghamshire,northwest of London after suffering a stroke a month ago. Shesuffered a first stroke in 1984.   Mrs. Woodhouse's son, Patrick, said: ``We shall miss her verymuch but she had been very ill for some time.''   In the 1970s and early 1980s, millions of dog owners in Britainand the United States watched Mrs. Woodhouse schooling pets on theBritish Broadcasting Corp. television program ``Training Dogs theWoodhouse Way.'' Before long, loyal viewers were telling theirdogs, ``Walkies!'' as her byword caught on.   Mrs. Woodhouse's book, ``No Bad Dogs, The Woodhouse Way,'' was abestseller in 1982.   She insisted no dog was untrainable and showed they could betaught within minutes with ``tone of voice, telepathy and a littlebit of loving.'' Her way of getting to know an animal was tobreathe into its nose.   Mrs. Woodhouse's smiling, bespectacled face, framed by shortgray hair, became a familiar sight on television talk shows. In1980, she was ``flabbergasted'' to be named female TV personalityof the year in Britain.   ``She had an amazing ability with animals,'' her husband, Dr.Michael Woodhouse, said.   The Woodhouses lived in Croxley Green in Hertfordshire north ofLondon.   The daughter of a clergyman, Mrs. Woodhouse developed her knackwith animals as a child when her mother boarded dogs. She learnedshe could stop their barking by talking to them in a quiet voice.   She trained dogs as her three children were growing up and atone time ran a hotel for dogs and their owners.   She made her first dog training film, ``Love Me, Love My Dog,''in 1955 using her Great Dane, Juno. It was shown in movie theatersaround the country. Her first record album, in 1967, had advancesales of 25,000.   Mrs. Woodhouse said she received 400 letters a day when thetelevision program was running.   She once told The Associated Press that because of thetelevision appearances, she could not go out in public withoutbeing asked for her advice, but she said she didn't mind.   The public recognition could be helpful, she said. Once, goingthrough passport control at a London airport, the inspector said``Oh, here's the dog lady. No need to see your passport. Walkies!''</TEXT></DOC>
