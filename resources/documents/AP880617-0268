This is not just the substitution of a fancy phrase for a simpleword to make the subject sound more elaborate.   It is a different approach to the business of managing pensionfunds and other large pools of money that comes close to the heartof the recent debate over computerized ``program trading,'' thecollapse of stock prices last fall and the future of the market.   To put it in simplest terms, asset allocation involves theeffort to spread and shift money among various categories ofinvestments for the greatest possible return.   The three main categories of financial investments in the U.S.markets are stocks, bonds and short term interest-bearingsecurities, such as Treasury bills, that are known in Wall Streetparlance as ``cash.''   The philosophy behind this, as described by the brokerage firmof Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. in a treatise on ``our position onfinancial market reform,'' is that ``the asset allocation decision,the choice of the proportions of the portfolio to hold in stocks,bonds or cash, is of greater importance than the stock selectiondecision.   ``These new asset allocation strategies ... consider the U.S.equity market in aggregate.   ``Active management is employed in shifts between stocks, bondsand cash, but passive management may be used within each categoryof assets.''   Passive management means not trying to beat the performance of agiven market, but rather simply seeking to duplicate it.   In the case of stocks, that may translate into buying a fund orpackage of stocks set up to duplicate the performance of a marketindex such as Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock composite index.   When you get seriously into the process of asset allocation,``program trades and stock index and bond index futures are themechanisms whereby exposure to each asset class are most easilyadjusted,'' Kidder Peabody said.   What could be wrong with all this? Many pension managers,sensibly enough, stopped trying to pick individual stocks when theywere confronted with studies showing they had little chance ofbeating the market that way. They were just too big.   Brokerage firms developed program trading, the index futuresstrategy known as portfolio insurance, and other asset allocationsystems in large measure to try to meet the needs and desires ofthose pension managers, who are some of the brokers' most importantcustomers.   In addition, the growth of international investing hascontributed to the popularity of asset allocation and indexinvesting.   As Kidder Peabody says: ``Many global investors view a country'sstock market as a single unit and prefer to trade it as such.Buying and selling individual stock issues when an investment in aforeign market is desired can be a very inefficient and costlymeans of active international investing.''   The problem some people have with all this is the lumping of allstocks together as a single ``market'' that can be bought and sold,making stocks no more distinguishable from one another than bushelsof corn or sheets of plywood.   If everybody practices asset allocation and nobody cares aboutindividual corporate earnings or dividends, then the market wouldlogically stop fulfilling its role as a means of promoting andrewarding business success.   ``We are at the point that traditional equities investors willcapitulate control of the equities market to the futures traders,''said William King at Nikko Securities International.   Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. maintains:``The function of financial markets is not to provide a privatehunting preserve where large institutions can get in or out quicklywith minimum costs.   ``The real function of the markets is to raise necessary capitaland to allocate it in the most efficient, productive way. And therethe markets are failing badly.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Mon June 20</NOTE></DOC>
