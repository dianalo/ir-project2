Maybe just as well. Asuccessful presidential tour is a bore, but a good debaclecan be a learning experience.   Surely the American nation learned for itself, via CNNfrom Tokyo, that it really doesn't want its head of state tobe a car salesman. The president of France can double as apitchman for Perrier and Camembert, but the president of theUnited States is in charge of a superpower. We expect more ofhim.</LP><TEXT>   Via the same hookup, the American public saw with its owneyes that the CEOs of the American-based auto companies whinea lot. It also learned that the heads of GM, Ford andChrysler are paid a lot more money than the heads of Toyota,Nissan and Honda. Now, Japanese CEOs no doubt get theircompensation in other ways, like expense accounts and bowing,and money is after all the American way. The public doesn'tmind seeing large incomes for real services, like throwingbaseballs, and no one complains when a Harvard dropoutbecomes a billionaire by starting a software company. Butsomehow Microsoft's William Gates did not show up in thepresidential entourage, and $4.8 million a year does seem alot of money for whining.   The American electorate is digesting these direct lessonsin its own acute, inchoate way. This is likely to mean thatprotectionism will once again show itself as the fool's goldof American politics.   ---   The pyrite glitter always attracts prospectingpoliticians; after all, foreigners don't vote. But it fadesin the cold light of the assay booth. So in 1988, RichardGephardt, who conquered the Iowa caucuses with aprotectionist message, shortly found himself dropping out ofthe Democratic primaries. And Sen. Robert Dole, as well asevangelist Pat Robertson, found the protection racket didn'twork in the Republican primary in South Carolina, heart oftextile country. For that matter, the longstandingcongressional careers of Sen. Reed Smoot and Rep. WillisHawley were both ended two years after passage of theirfamous 1930 tariff.   For one thing, the protectionist appeal keeps stubbing itstoe on stubborn reality. Chrysler, GM and Ford put thedriving wheel on the wrong side to sell in Japan, forexample. When Michael Dukakis's campaign stumbled in 1988, hejoined Rep. Gephardt on a visit to Moog Automotive Inc., nearSt. Louis, telling workers he didn't want America's children&quot;to work for foreign owners, pay rent to foreign owners andowe their future to foreign owners.&quot; The Moog workers hearingthis were happily employed by the same Italian holdingcompany that owns Fiat.   Like Mr. Dukakis, President Bush is in principle in favorof free trade, only sticking a toe into protectionism to testthe water. On CNN Sunday, Commerce Secretary Mosbacher deniedeven the toe, saying the president wanted to open Japanesemarkets rather than close American ones. The auto executiveshad to be invited along, he explained, because autosrepresent a big part of the trade deficit with Japan. Mr.Mosbacher, who is changing hats to run the Bush re-electioneffort, asks us to believe the White House didn't understandthat inclusion of the auto chiefs would put a protectionistspin on the trip.   Transparently, though, the spin was domestic politics.&quot;Jobs, jobs, jobs&quot; was the theme, and the centerpiece was anagreement for the Japanese to buy more American auto partsthan they want to. The president wanted at least to seem tobe doing something about the recession, and unable to get aneconomic policy out of Congress, he wanted to get one out ofthe Japanese. And he wanted to blunt Pat Buchanan's insurgentnativist appeal in the New Hampshire Republican primary.   Yet the president came back with an agreement to managetrade, an image of begging the Japanese to help and aconfession to Australian farmers that we're guilty too -- notto mention his unfortunate illness and his tennis loss to theemperor. None of this will help efforts to fight off managedtrade when it's offered by France or India in negotiationsfor a new free trade round. Even in domestic politics, thepotential costs are considerable.   First, the embarrassments from Tokyo to Sydney call intoquestion Mr. Bush's sure grip on foreign affairs. To say theleast, the trip did not provide much evidence of a New WorldOrder. The media are just now starting to celebrate victoryin the Gulf War, asking why Saddam Hussein is still pesteringhis neighbors and terrorizing his countrymen. It will now beopen season on the president's foreign record as well as hisdomestic one.   Worse, it will be open season on his capacity forleadership. The questions will be: What kind of a presidentlets Pat Buchanan push him around? And, if George Bush ismushy even in his devotion to free trade, what does hebelieve in? Naturally, the first critic to find this jugularwas noncandidate Mario Cuomo, labeling the Bush White House&quot;more responsive to the polls and the political winds thananybody.&quot; He told Ted Koppel the other night, &quot;They willchange their mind on abortion, they'll change their mind ontax cuts, all you have to do is get enough people to stand upand say `You're wrong.'&quot;   ---   This could all pass, of course, as quickly as the 24-hourflu. The worrisome thing is that the president may actuallybe a minority of one who believes his trip was a success.Instead, he needs to start asking questions: How did we gowrong? Whose idea was this anyway? Isn't the best politicsdoing the job of president? Could it be there's something to&quot;the vision thing&quot; after all? For a vision, how about the onethat won three presidential landslides in a row?   If George Bush starts to ask himself questions like these,maybe his trip will turn out to be a success after all,indeed a turning point in his presidency. A good debacle canbe a learning experience not only for a people but for apresident.   ---   Mr. Bartley is editor of the Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
