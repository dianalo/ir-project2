 It may seemlike a story about an enhancement to an operating-system software product,but it's really not.andP;  There is no reason to tell you about a product that youprobably won't purchase this year or even next year.andP;  By the time youpurchase this product--and I have no doubt you eventually will--you'll have alater version than the one I describe here.andP;  Some things I say in thisarticle may no longer be true.andP;  Other things will be very obvious to you.andM;This story is really about the future of PC application software, theapplications that you'll be using for much of the next decade.andP;  Theseapplications will probably be written for, and will run under, the OS/2Presentation Manager.andM;Like all operating systems, OS/2 is meaningless in itself.andP;  The support ofapplication programs is its primary function.andP;  OS/2 is a relatively newoperating system, and the Presentation Manager (included for the first timein OS/2 1.1) is never still.andP;  Obviously, most applications for thePresentation Manager have not yet been written or even conceived.andM;When these applications become available, I think you'll discover that theyare better than what you're using now.andP;  They will be easy to learn but at thesame time very powerful; visually attractive but also visually interactive;fun to use yet designed for serious work.andM;Making possible this new generation of PC application software is what theOS/2 Presentation Manager is all about.andM;AGUIFOR OS/2andM;The Presentation Manager is a graphical user interface (or GUI) for OS/2.andO;Many concepts of the GUI were originally developed at Xerox's Palo AltoResearch Center (PARC) and first successfully brought to small computers withthe Apple Macintosh.andP;  The GUI has come to be regarded as the state of the artin user interfaces and will probably be common on computers (both small andlarge) produced over much of the next decade.andM;Typically a GUI displays multiple programs in separate windows on the screen.andO;Users can move these windows around, resize them, and easily switch among theprograms.andP;  The programs have a consistent user interface that makes use ofpull-down menus, dialog boxes, and graphical objects such as scroll bars andbuttons.andM;Programs running under a GUI use graphics for all screen output.andP;  This makespossible the display of text in different fonts and sizes, as well as theeasy integration and manipulation of text and graphics.andP;  The use of graphicsresults in a richer and denser information content than is possible incharacter mode.andM;Graphical user interfaces commonly support a secondary user-input device,most often a mouse.andP;  The mouse provides an easy way for the user to switchamong programs, manipulate windows, and indicate program options.andM;Users generally find a graphical user interface easy to learn.andP;  The GUIestablishes a consistency in the user interface that allows knowlege of oneapplication to carry over into the next.andP;  Ease of operation becomesincreasingly more important as the use of PCs extends to less-sophisticatedand more-casual users.andP;  Of course, power users also benefit.andP;  If the basicfunctions of a program are trivial to learn, more time can be spent on themore-difficult features (such as macro languages).andM;The Presentation Manager makes its debut in OS/2 1.1.andP;  Its absence from OS/21.0 (released in December 1987 and discussed in &quot;OS/2: A New Beginning for PCApplications,&quot; PC Magazine, April 12, 1988) may indicate that thePresentation Manager has been &quot;tacked on&quot; to the base operating system.andP;  Butit's more accurate to see the Presentation Manager as an integral part ofOS/2.andP;  In this sense, OS/2 1.1 is the first real version of OS/2, while OS/21.0 was an unfinished interim product.andP;  The Presentation Manager is theprimary application environment of OS/2.andP;  The future applications that cometo characterize the operating system will be written for the PresentationManager environment.andM;OS/2 is being developed by IBM and Microsoft working under a jointdevelopment agreement.andP;  Both companies always intended for the new operatingsystem to support some type of multitasking windowing environment, but atfirst they did not see eye to eye on the form this interface would take.andO;Presentation Manager is a result of negotiation, collaboration, and a mergingof software technologies.andM;STRANGE BEDFELLOWSandM;Like politics, the computer industry sometimes makes strange bedfellows.andO;It's hard to imagine two companies more different than IBM and Microsoft, andharder still to believe that any codevelopment between these two industrygiants could work at all, let alone yield a worthwhile product.andP;  But in aclassic example of synergy, the Presentation Manager turned out to besuperior to anything either company could have created by itself.andM;IBM (bigger than Microsoft) got to name the product.andP;  &quot;Presentation Manager&quot;is a pretty klunky name all right, but that's IBM.andP;  The Presentation Managerincludes a sophisticated vector-graphics programming interface, one of themost powerful graphics systems ever brought to a personal computer.andP;  Andthat's IBM, too.andM;Much of the windowing and user interface technology in Presentation Managercomes from Microsoft Windows, a DOS operating environment that Microsoftintroduced in 1985.andP;  The graphics system in Presentation Manager includessome raster graphics and bitmap support (in addition to the IBM vectorgraphics technology) that also comes from Microsoft Windows.andM;In software technology, the Pesentation Manager combines the best that IBMand Microsoft have to offer.andP;  The involvement of both companies in theproduct is also beneffical for more-practical reasons.andP;  Although Microsofthas succeeded in making Windows a GUI standard for DOS, this has been o longand laborious process.andP;  The endorsement of IBM helps ensure that OS/2 and thePresentation Manager will become industry standards more quickly.andM;But IBM could not have done it alone.andP;  In recent year IBM, working by itself,has had great difficulty establishing standards in either software (witnessTOPView, IBM's nongraphical windowing environment) or hardware (the MicroChannel architecture of the PS/2).andP;  Fear that IBM wants to move toproprietary hardware and operating systems inhibits industry acceptance ofanything from IBM that is not built with the concept of open architecture.andM;The involvement of Microsoft helps to establish OS/2 as an industry standardrather than an IBM proprietary product.andP;  Microsoft will be licensing OS/2 andthe Presentation Manager to other hardware manufacturers that will adapt itto their own hardware.andM;IBM's version of OS/2 1.1 was released on the last day of October 1988.andO;Other hardware manufacturers are expected to follow with their versions ofOS/2 1.1 during 1989.andM;APPLICATIONS ON THE HORIZONandM;Of course, it makes little sense for most users to consider moving from DOSto OS/2 until a sufficient number of Presentation Manager applications becomeavailable.andP;  Some applications are expected this year, but OS/2 probably won'tbcome viable for most users until 1990 or 1991.andM;Some of the early Presentation Manager programs will be applications nowavailable for Windows.andP;  These include Aldus's PageMaker and Microsoft Excel(two programs originally developed for the Apple Macintosh) and several CADproducts from Micrografx, including Designer.andP;  The Presentation Managerversions of these programs will probably show better performance than theWindows versions owing to increased memory space, better memory management,and more-efficient multitasking under OS/2.andM;Microrim and Oracle have both demonstrated early versions of PresentationManager database products, and Ashton-Tate plans a Presentation Managerversion of dBASE.andP;  In the spreadsheet arena, Lotus Development Corp. plans tointroduce 1-2-3/G, a Presentation Manager version of the best-sellingspreadsheet program.andP;  It will have some competition from Microsoft Excel, aswell as Presentation Manager versions of Borland's Quattro and ComputerAssociates's SuperCalc.andM;Word processing, too, reaps benefits from a graphical user interface bygaining a true WYSIWYG display.andP;  Although Microsoft and WordPerfect have notofficially announced plans for the Presentation Manager, it's quite likelythat both companies are working on something.andP;  Presentation Manager versionsof MultiMate, DisplayWrite, and WordStar are also expected.andM;The first company to release a Presentation Manager application is BorlandInternational, with SideKick for Presentation Manager.andP;  Although the programwas not available at press time, demonstrations of this new SideKick havebeen very impressive.andP;  It is quite different from the old program andintroduces some powerful features.andP;  For example, the calculator &quot;paper tape&quot;is actually a one-column spreadsheet that can be edited (with changesrippling through the calculation), saved, and retrieved.andP;  The phone directorycreates a Paradox database.andM;The role of Borland in developing the first commercially availablePresentation Manager application is significant: historically, Borland hasbeen a strong critic of Microsoft Windows.andP;  But like many other companies,Borland apparently sees the Presentation Manager as the environment that willsupport future PC software.andM;HARDWARE REQUIREMENTSandM;The hardware necessary to run the OS/2 Presentation Manager has been thesubject of much confusion and misinformation.andP;  I will try not to add to thisconfusion, but I think it would be helpful to make a distinction between&quot;minimum&quot; and &quot;practical&quot; requirements.andP;  The minimum requirements are whatyou need to run OS/2 1.1 with no regard to performance, whereas the practicalrequirements are what you need to achieve adequate performance, operationalease, and reasonable video display fidelity.andP;  The minimum requirements to runOS/2 1.1 are an 80286- or 80386-based personal computer with 1MB of memory, agraphics video board and display, and a 10MB hard disk.andM;IBM's version of OS/2 1.1 supports all its 80286- and 80386-based PCs (the PCAT, the XT Model 286, and PS/2 Models 50 and above).andP;  Other vendors' versionsof OS/2 1.1 will support their 80286- and 80386-based machines.andP;  Obviously,OS/2 will run better on a high-speed 80386 machine than on a low-speed 80286.andO;But so will most other software.andM;The 1MB minimum memory requirement is probably the lowest OS/2 memoryrequirement you've ever seen, but it's no misprint.andP;  OS/2 will boot and runin 1MB and will even allow a 256K DOS compatibility mode.andP;  I've done it, andit works.andM;Running OS/2 1.1 under 1MB of memory is equivalent to living in an apartmentwith 3 by 6 feet of floor space and a large closet.andP;  You may not becomfortable, but you could keep most of your possessions in the closet andtake out only what you need at any one time.andP;  In this analogy, the largecloset is your hard disk.andP;  OS/2 implements virtual memory, which means thatif it needs more memory than is physically available, it will use hard diskspace to temporarily store data in memory.andP;  When this data is needed again,OS/2 will save something else in memory on the hard disk and swap in what itneeds.andP;  Only when the hard disk fills up will OS/2 applications actually runout of memory.andM;While OS/2 1.1 may run under 1MB, performance is intolerable.andP;  IBM recommendsa more practical requirement for the operating system: 2MB with another 512Kif a DOS compatibility mode is used.andP;  But 4MB offers a more comfortableenvironment for the operating system and a couple of applications runningconcurrently.andM;Beyond this, estimations of practical memory requirements get a littletricky.andP;  It depends on the size of the applications you run, how many youhave loaded at the same time, and what performance degradation you arewilling to tolerate.andM;The performance problems will occur mostly in switching among programs.andP;  Whena program has been loaded into memory but is not doing anything, OS/2 candiscard the program's code segments and swap its data segments to disk.andP;  Theprogram then takes up very little memory.andP;  But when you switch to the programto use it, the code and data segments must be reloaded.andP;  This results in adisk access.andP;  If you want to keep several large programs loaded and you won'ttolerate any disk access when switching among them (and if RAM prices drop toa reasonable level), you'll want at least another couple of megabytes.andM;People will run OS/2 with various amounts of memory depending on theapplications they run, their work habits, the performance they want from thesystem, and the thickness of their wallets.andP;  Systems will range from 3MB onup, probably averaging in the 6 to 8MB region a few years from now.andM;This may sound like a lot, but it's following a normal trend.andP;  In 1980,before the IBM PC was introduced, 64K was normal on CP/M machines.andP;  By 1985,PC users were butting up against the 640K memory limit of the PCarchitecture.andP;  Six megabytes for 1990 is right in line.andM;The initial release of IBM's OS/2 1.1 has graphics device drivers for theEnhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA), Video Graphics Array (VGA), and the IBM8514/A.andP;  Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) support is expected in a set of devicedrivers that IBM is scheduled to distribute at the end of February 1989.andO;(The IBM monochrome board is not capable of graphics and thus cannot be usedwith the Presentation Manager.)andM;In time, manufacturers of other video boards are expected to develop anddistribute their own device drivers for Presentation Manager, just as they dotoday for Microsoft Windows.andP;  From the perspective of application programs,the Presentation Manager has a device-independent graphics interface.andP;  If adevice driver is available for a particular video display adapter, allprograms written for the Presentation Manager can use it without any changes.andM;The CGA (black-and-white with 640- by 200-pixel resolution) is the minimumrequirement for a Presentation Manager video board.andP;  But the practicalrequirement is an EGA, with 640 by 350 resolution and 16 colors.andP;  Higher onthe scale is a VGA, increasing the resolution to 640 by 480.andM;Because the Presentation Manager works with graphics, performance will beimproved by video boards with hardware-assisted drawing.andP;  The first suchboard with a Presentation Manager driver is the IBM 8514/A (1,024- by768-pixel resolution with 256 colors).andP;  This is not the last word in videoadapter technology.andM;For a hard disk, the minimum requirement is 10MB.andP;  But OS/2 1.1 itselfoccupies 8MB of hard disk space, and you'll want to reserve a couple ofmegabytes for disk swapping, so this is a real minimum and leaves no room forapplications!andP;  A practical requirement would depend on the size of theapplications you'll be using.andP;  A 30 or 40MB hard disk will be fine for manyusers, but 80 to 120MB would be safer.andM;You'll also want a mouse for the Presentation Manager.andP;  While the system hasa complete keyboard interface (and most Presentation Manager programs willalso), a mouse certainly adds to the ease of use.andM;Another desirable hardware option is a printer capable of graphics.andP;  As withvideo boards, the device-independent graphics interface of the PresentationManager will allow all Presentation Manager programs to use a printer forwhich a device driver is available.andP;  The initial release of OS/2 1.1 includedonly one device driver that supports the IBM Proprinters I and II, but thisdeficiency is obviously only temporary.andP;  For example, a PostScript driver forthe Presentation Manager is expected soon.andM;FIRST ENCOUNTERSandM;Assuming that OS/2 1.1 is the current version when you decide to move fromDOS to OS/2 (which will probably not be the case), here's what you'll findwhen you open the box and install the system.andM;The IBM OS/2 1.1 package consists of five high-density diskettes and onebinder containing several manuals.andP;  The package is available with either5-1/4-inch diskettes (for the IBM PC AT and the XT Model 286) or 3-1/2-inchdiskettes (for the IBM PS/2 Models 50 and above).andP;  The documentation includesa 159-page Getting Started manual, a 281-page Using the System manual, a176-page Command Reference, and a 54-page System Editor manual (covering anew full-screen text editor).andM;Installation of OS/2 1.1 on a hard disk is fairly easy.andP;  You boot up theinstallation diskette and follow the instructions.andP;  This takes about 20minutes.andP;  Most files on the distribution diskettes are in a packed format, soit would be difficult to install OS/2 1.1 without the installation program.andO;The installation creates several subdirectories on your hard disk, copiesfiles from the diskettes, and unpacks the files.andM;After the installation you can boot OS/2 1.1 from your hard disk.andP;  Midwaythrough the boot process, the screen switches to a graphics mode.andP;  A windowand several icons appear, as shown in Figure 1.andP;  This is the PresentationManager session.andM;The program in the center of the screen is labeled Start Programs.andP;  Thiswindow lists the programs currently installed to run under OS/2.andP;  You can runone of these by moving the reverse-video highlight with the keyboard andpressing Enter, or by using a mouse to double-click (pressing the mousebutton twice in succession) the program you want to run.andM;The programs installed on the Start Programs window are organized in&quot;groups.&quot;andP;  Start Programs initially displays the Main Group, but you canswitch to the Utility Programs Group from the menu.andP;  The menu also lets youadd and delete groups and add and delete installed programs within a group.andM;The Main Group includes two items labeled &quot;OS/2 full-screen command prompt&quot;and &quot;OS/2 windowed command prompt.&quot;andP;  These start up the OS/2 CMD.EXE program(the equivalent of COMMAND.COM in DOS) for entering OS/2 commands or runningOS/2 programs from the command line prompt.andP;  You can run CMD.EXE in either aseparate full-screen character-mode session (as in OS/2 1.0) or in a textwindow in the Presentation Manager session.andP;  Figure 2 shows several copies ofCMD.EXE running in different windows.andM;As is the case with CMD.EXE, most programs written for OS/2 1.0 can be run intheir own full-screen sessions or in text windows in the Presentation Managersession.andP;  OS/2 1.0 programs cannot take advantage of Presentation Managergraphics and other aspects of the user interface.andP;  Programs prohibited fromrunning in a text window are those that write directly to video displaymemory and those that install monitors or subsystems.andM;Using either the keyboard or the mouse, you can switch among windows, move orresize windows, &quot;maximize&quot; a window to fill the whole screen, &quot;minimize&quot; awindow to be displayed as a small icon, or &quot;close&quot; the window (whichterminates the program).andM;The icon at the lower right corner of the screen is the Task Manager.andP;  Youcan display the Task Manager window at any time by pressing Ctrl-Esc.andP;  (Ifyou're currently in a character-mode session, OS/2 will switch to thePresentation Manager session when you press Ctrl-Esc.)andP;  Within thePresentation Manager session, you can also enable the Task Manager bydouble-clicking the icon with the mouse.andM;The Task Manager displays the names of all currently running programs, asshown in Figure 3.andP;  You can switch to one of these programs by using eitherthe keyboard or the mouse.andP;  For a program running in a character-modesession, OS/2 will switch to that session.andP;  For programs in the PresentationManager session, the program that you switch to will be moved to the top ofall of the other windows.andM;The icon at the lower left corner of the screen is labeled DOS.andO;Double-clicking this icon with the mouse (or selecting &quot;DOS command prompt&quot;from the Task Manager) switches to the full-screen DOS compatibility modesession, which you can use for running most DOS programs.andP;  The remaining icondisplays a little image of a printer.andP;  This is the OS/2 print spoolerprogram.andP;  Its window lists all print jobs currently queued or being printed.andM;Three other Presentation Manager programs are included with OS/2 1.1 and canbe run from the Start Programs window.andP;  Introducing OS/2 is a short tutorialthat takes you through the basics of the interface.andP;  The Control Panel(listed in the Utility Programs group) lets you set the system date and time,change system defaults (such as the screen colors), and install printerdrivers and font files.andM;The File System (shown in Figure 4) is the most sophisticated PresentationManager program included in OS/2 1.1.andP;  This program displays a directory treeand lets you open multiple directory windows that list the files in thedirectory.andP;  Menu commands let you perform the equivalents of many OS/2 filecommands.andP;  Some file operations can be performed without help from the menu.andO;For example, you can move files from one directory to another by opening twodirectory windows, selecting the files you want to move, and then draggingthe files with the mouse to the destination directory window.andM;At almost any time, help is available by pressing F1.andP;  Help windows displaytext in the default Presentation Manager font, an easy-to-read,proportionally spaced Helvetica.andP;  A help window from the File System is shownin Figure 5.andM;Although the programs included in OS/2 1.1 are functional and do what they'resupposed to do, some of them--in particular, Start Programs, Task Manager,File System, and Control Panel--are not quite ready for prime time.andP;  They arecertainly not shining examples of what can be done in the PresentationManager and still need some work before they function in a truly natural andintuitive fashion.andM;For example, the Task Manager and Start Programs windows, which performcompletely different functions, look very similar and often list some of thesame programs, which makes them easy to confuse.andP;  The installation ofprinters in the Control Panel is a total disaster.andP;  The File Manager has somegood ideas, but I get frustrated every time I try to use it.andM;The initial release of OS/2 1.1 also lacks some essential pieces, such asgraphics printer drivers for anything except the IBM Proprinters I and II.andO;(As of this writing, some additional printer drivers for IBM printers areexpected from IBM shortly.)andP;  Microsoft is working to get printer driverswritten for non-IBM printers, but it is still not clear to me how thesedrivers will be distributed.andM;For most users, these problems are irrelevant.andP;  The deficiencies are soobvious that I'm sure everyone at Microsoft and IBM knows of them.andP;  By thetime most users get their hands on the Presentation Manager, these programswill be fixed.andM;What is much more important, of course, is the Presentation Manager API(application program interface).andP;  This is what programmers must work with towrite applications for the Presentation Manager.andM;THE PROGRAMMER'S VIEWandM;The primary purpose of the OS/2 Presentation Manager is to provide a platformfor applications written specifically to its API.andP;  While most users will notencounter the Presentation Manager until these programs are written,programmers must look at the Presentation Manager much earlier.andP;  Obviously,the applications that they write will determine how users will eventuallyencounter the Presentation Manager.andM;Programmers approaching the Presentation Manager API as their first graphicaluser interface will find a system that is very big, initially confusing, andconceptually difficult.andP;  The API is big because it adds about 500 functioncalls to OS/2.andP;  These are divided almost equally between the two maincomponents of the system: the windowing and user interface component, and theGraphics Programming Interface (GPI).andM;The Presentation Manager API is initially confusing and difficult because,like most graphical user interfaces, it is based on an &quot;event-driven&quot; or&quot;message-driven&quot; model.andP;  This differs considerably from the &quot;top-down&quot; modelthat most programmers are accustomed to, and it requires some mentalreorientation.andP;  The relationship between a Presentation Manager program andthe operating system is simply not the same as (and is significantly morecomplex than) the program/operating system relationship in more conventionalenvironments.andM;Programmers experienced with Windows have a head start.andP;  They will find muchfamiliar territory in the Presentation Manager API.andP;  The APIs of the twosystems are similarly structured, but they differ in nearly all the details,particularly in the graphics language.andP;  The big distinction between Windowsand the Presentation Manager is that windows is an add-on to DOS (whichinhibited some software manufacturers from considering a Windows product),while the Presentation Manager is an integral part of OS/2.andM;Programmers acquainted with other GUIs (such as the Apple Macintosh, GEM, orthe Unix X Window system) will also find some familiar concepts, but many newones as well.andP;  The Presentation Manager and Windows go further than most GUIsin implementing a more object-oriented environment.andM;When a Presentation Manager program first begins execution, it performs somenecessary initialization (in particular, creating a window for the program)and then remains dormant while awaiting messages from the operating system.andO;These messages inform the program of significant events.andP;  Some messagessignal user input from the keyboard and the mouse.andP;  Other messages come fromthe program's menu or other user interface objects such as scroll bars.andP;  Theprogram also receives a message when the user has resized the program'swindow or when part of the surface of the program's window has to be updated.andO;Working with this message-driven structure is a significant hurdle for theprogrammer.andM;I suspect it will take a couple of years for programmers to become suitablyfamiliar with OS/2 and the Presentation Manager to begin exploiting its fullpotential.andP;  (This delay is normal.andP;  for example, although the very firstversion of DOS released in 1981 could support RAM-resident programs,commercial products using this technique did not become prevalent until1984.)andM;With experience, the Presentation Manager API reveals itself to beextraordinary, well crafted, and elegant.andP;  For most tasks that a program mustperform, the API maintains a careful balance between ease, power, andversatility.andP;  Overall, it is perhaps the best API ever implemented for agraphical user interface environment.andP;  GPI, in particular, is a very powerfulgraphics programming tool.andM;There are a few minor flaws in the API, of course, but that's to be expected.andO;In real life, perfection is rarely achieved.andP;  The API also lacks a fewhelpful high-level items, such as multiline edit controls (supported underWindows) and a standardized File Open dialog box (which the Macintosh has).andM;THE BASE OPERATING SYSTEMandM;Because the Presentation Manager is part of OS/2, programs written for thePresentation Manager benefit from the strength of the base operating system.andM;OS/2 uses the protected-mode operation of the 80286 and 80386 microprocessorsto make available a 16MB physical address space.andP;  The implementation ofvirtual memory also allows each application to use much more memory than isphysically available.andM;OS/2 is a multitasking operating system, obviously an important feature for agraphical user interface that can run several programs at once.andP;  Unlike thatof Microsoft Windows, OS/2's multitasking is preemptive and priority-based.andO;OS/2 also has other operating-system support necessary for multitasking, suchas file sharing and protection, and semaphores that help coordinate access ofresources by multiple applications.andM;OS/2 programs can themselves take advantage of OS/2's multitasking bycreating multiple threads of execution, each of which can run concurrently.andO;It turns out that multiple threads are particularly useful in a graphicaluser interface.andP;  The messaging architecture of the Presentation Managersometimes inhibits normal preemptive multitasking because all messagesrelated to user input must be serialized (processed one after another, ornonconcurrently).andP;  Programs can get around this limitation by creatingadditional threads of execution that carry out work independently of themessaging architecture.andP;  This results in a much smoother and more efficientoverall operation of the system.andM;INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATIONandM;One particular strength of OS/2 1.0 was the support of various types ofinterprocess communication (IPC).andP;  These include shared memory, systemsemaphores, Unix-style pipes, and queues.andM;OS/2 1.1 adds three more forms if IPC to this collection.andP;  First, &quot;namedpipes&quot; are now a part of the base operating system rather than only part ofMicrosoft's LAN Manager.andP;  While named pipes are the most important form ofIPC over a local area network, they may also be used by programs running onthe same machine.andM;The second form of new interprocess communication is the Presentation Managerclipboard.andP;  This is a form of shared memory that assists in cut-and-pasteoperations between programs.andP;  Under user control, a program can copy data ina specific format to the clipboard, and other programs (or the same program)can retrieve this data and paste it into its document file.andM;Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is a form of interprocess communicationoriginally developed for Microsoft Windows that is also supported under thePresentation Manager.andP;  DDE is based on the messaging architecture of thePresentation Manager.andP;  It allows programs to send out requests forinformation from other programs (perhaps even programs that the requester isnot familiar with) and receive this information through messages.andM;THE CONSISTENT USER INTERFACEandM;The Presentation Manager establishes (but does not impose) a consistent userinterface for programs.andP;  All the logic that implements menus, dialog boxes,buttons, scroll bars, and so forth is built into the Presentation Manager.andO;All menus in Presentation Manager programs function the same way because theyuse this common code.andM;If Windows is any indication, programmers who write applications for thePresentation Manager will go further by styling their programs' menus onthose of existing programs.andP;  For example, many programs (such as wordprocessors, spreadsheets, and so forth) work with files.andP;  The recommendedpractice in Windows and the Presentation Manager is to name the first item onthe program's menu &quot;File.&quot;andP;  This option invokes a pull-down menu with an Openoption that displays a dialog box to open a new file.andP;  The keystrokes Alt-F-Owill always invoke a dialog box to open a file regardless of the program.andM;Although some people fear that this consistent user interface will causeapplication programs to become overly similar and bland, this has not beenthe case in Macintosh or Windows software.andP;  What actually happens is quitedifferent: the Presentation Manager takes care of the more mundame aspects ofthe user interface, leaving the programmer free to spend more time where itreally counts.andM;DEVICE-INDEPENDENT GRAPHICSandM;DOS is so weak on even text output that many programmers ignore the operatingsystem and the ROM BIOS and write output directly to the screen.andP;  Forgraphics, writing directly to the screen is nearly a necessity.andP;  Over theyears this has caused problems, since programs must struggle to keep up todate with emerging graphics standards.andM;The situation with printers is even worse.andP;  Most DOS word processing programsthese days come with one or two diskettes filled with nothing but smallfiles, each one for a particular printer.andM;Presentation Manager's device-independent graphics system, GPI, makes thiscollection of files no longer necessary.andP;  Presentation Manager programs useGPI for all text and graphics output.andP;  Device drivers take care oftranslating the graphics to a particular output device.andM;GPI is largely derived from IBM's Graphics Data Display Manager (GDDM)mainframe graphics system, with some extensions inherited from Windows.andO;Quite simply, GPI is the most sophisticated and powerful graphics systemavailable for small computers (with the possible exception of DisplayPostScript).andP;  GPI goes far beyond the graphics systems in other popularwindowing environments, such as the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI),Macintosh QuickDraw, and the Unix X Window system, and even beyond morededicated graphics programming languages such as the two-dimensionalimplementation of the Graphical Kernel System (GKS).andM;Here are a few features for graphics aficionados: GPI supports bothimage-based and vector-based fonts; a variety of curved lines (ellipses,Bezier splines, and quadratic interpolations); a hierarchy of coordinatespaces with matrix transforms between them; rectangular and arbitrarynonrectangular clipping; PostScript-style paths (used for filling, clipping,or thick stroking with ends and joins); alternate and winding area fillmodes; all 256 possible raster operations for displaying a bitmap combinedwith a pattern on a surface; color table (palette) support; retention ofgraphics drawing orders in segments; and metafiles that retain the currentgraphics state as well as drawing and attribute commands.andM;That such a rich graphics system is included in OS/2--and available to everyprogram that uses the Presentation Maager API--still, to my mind,astonishing.andM;LAURELS AND ADMONITIONSandM;People who enthuse about the direction that IBM and Microsoft have taken withOS/2 (and I am obviously one of these people see the Presentation Manager asa important evolutionary step for the industry that has grown up aroudn theIBM PC.andP;  As a successor to DOS and a competitor of everything from the AppleMacintosh to Sun workstations, OS/2 and the Presentation Manager must helpbring the PC into the modern age.andM;Most important, IBM and Microsoft have done a really fine job with thePresentation Manager API.andP;  This is obviously the critical part of the system,and it's in good shape.andP;  In contrast, the various programs included in theretail release of OS/2 1.1 obviously need some more work.andP;  these are theprograms that are important for using Presentation Manager.andP;  They must beeasy to use and intuitive, and they must be models of good PresentationManager programming style.andP;  They are not.andM;Another troublesome aspect of the Presentation Manager involves thedevelopment and distribution of device drivers for video display adapters andprinters.andP;  At this time it seems as if IBM is interested in supporting onlyvideo boards and printers that have IBM labels on them.andP;  The people atMicrosoft have taken a much greater interest in getting printer driverswritten, but it is not clear at this time how these drivers will bedistributed.andP;  I think that IBM and other hardware manufacturers that sellOS/2 should be involved at least in the distribution (if not the development)of these devices drivers.andM;OS/2 and the Presentation Manager have taken a lot of flak regarding thehardware (particularly memory) required to run the system with reasonableperformance.andP;  This is partially the result of OS/2's being released at a timewhen memory prices are very high.andP;  But certainly no one at IBM or Microsoftcan claim that the OS/2 and Presentation Manager code is as memory efficientas possible.andP;  This is another area where more work should be done, even ifit's likely that memory prices will be more reasonable by the time most usersare ready for OS/2.andM;It strikes me that it would truly be a shame if the success of a system asfine as this one were compromised by something as trivial as memory chips.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
