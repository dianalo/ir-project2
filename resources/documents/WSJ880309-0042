The dog runs a close second.    It all began eight years ago, when tourists discovered the powdery beaches of this tropical island. With the tourists came drugs. Almost overnight, Sri Lanka developed an illegal-drug problem. From no known heroin addicts in 1980, the country now has 30,000.    To combat the drugs, Sri Lanka went to the dogs: drug-sniffing German shepherds, to be precise. Twelve Sri Lankan policemen were dispatched for dog-training courses in Austria and West Germany. They came back with nine dogs that went to work at the airport and the docks.    But with the imported dogs came problems. One was cost. Whenever they stray from the country's cool capital, the northern-bred dogs need air-conditioned accommodation. Special vehicles have been built to squire them around. Each dog needs a trainer. A cook prepares the dog chow. Upkeep runs to $150 a month per canine, triple the salaries of the trainers.    But the biggest problem came on jumbo jets from the Persian Gulf, Indonesia and Pakistan. Moslem visitors to Sri Lanka won't tolerate dogs sniffing them or their luggage.    &quot;It's repulsive to them,&quot; says Donald Mendis, director of the Police Narcotics Bureau. So the dogs covertly sniff the passengers' bags outside the airport arrival hall. They can't get within a whiff of the passengers themselves. Which got the Sri Lankans to thinking: If only a less-expensive, less-offensive animal could be used.    Like the mongoose.    Upcountry Sri Lankans frequently keep mongooses around the house. When domesticated at an early age, they prove themselves clever, clean and extremely sharp of smell. Unlike the German shepherd, it thrives in the tropics. Could the mongoose, happy in the heat and ignored by the Koran, be trained to sniff drugs?    The U.S. State Department pledged $10,000 for an experimental training program, although the public announcement gave some trouble to the department's spokesman, Charles Redman. &quot;Mongeese? Mongooses?&quot; he puzzled before amused Washington reporters.    The training of 10 mongooses began in September at Colombo Zoological Gardens, in a row of cages behind the jaguars. One was a complete failure. &quot;I think it's bitten every one of us,&quot; complains Bradley Fernando, the zoo's director. Seven others are considered too temperamental.    That leaves Tikki and Noni, who have learned to find buried film canisters stuffed with hashish and have begun trials with heroin.    Tikki and Noni have hungry eyes and sharp teeth. With their tapered tails and pointy snouts, they could be a fashion designer's rethink of a rat. Even if they prove adept at ferreting out drugs, there are several questions. Will jet-lagged passengers find them amusing? And what will the mongoose do once it detects drugs on a visitor?    &quot;I don't know if it will squeak or wag its tail or lie down,&quot; admits Superintendent Mendis. &quot;We'll have to teach it to make a signal.&quot; Asks local newspaper columnist Rodney Jonklaas: &quot;What guarantee is there that the canny creatures will not ascend baggy pants and slacks?&quot;    Sri Lankans aren't the only ones experimenting with new drug sniffers. A German researcher has high hopes for drug-sensitive pigs.    And the Israelis are training bedbugs to detect heroin. The bedbugs are placed in a porous box; when they smell the drugs, they become agitated and their movements are amplified electronically. Colombo Zoo's Mr. Fernando calls that experiment &quot;far-out.&quot;    According to a joke making the rounds in Colombo, the mongoose project's success would be bad news indeed for the region's drug smugglers. On the other hand, it would be great news for Colombo's cobras -- the mongoose's natural prey. </TEXT></DOC>
