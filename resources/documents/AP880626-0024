The Democrat's camp has a less charitable label:``hit squad.''   No matter the name, the Bush surrogates _ made up of senatorsand House members, governors, and other prominent Republicans _ arealready having an impact on the 1988 presidential race.   The surrogates are fanning out across the country andcriticizing the all-but-certain Democratic nominee, sometimesspeaking in the same cities hours before or after Dukakis, atechnique the Bush campaign calls ``bracketing.''   For a national campaign strapped for cash, the tactic isinexpensive and enables the vice president to get mileage from thesharp attacks without having to utter the words himself.   The Republican strategy became apparent during a Dukakis swingthrough the South last week when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., spokein Nashville and Miami a day ahead of Dukakis, branding theMassachusetts governor soft on crime and an opponent of the deathpenalty.   Dukakis called it negative campaigning and derided McCain assomeone who ``doesn't know beans from brown bread.'' But the GOPfootwork was not lost on Dukakis strategists.   A few days later, Bush delivered a strong law-and-order speechto the National Association of Sheriffs in Louisville, Ky. Afterthe room cleared, one sheriff lingered near the press area. Wearinga large ``Dukakis'' sticker, he was hard to miss.   Sheriff Robert C. Rufo of Suffolk County, Mass., which includesthe city of Boston, suggested the vice president _ not Dukakis _lacked a crime-fighter's record.   ``At all these conventions, there are going to be very strongDukakis supporters. They're not going to be shy,'' said LeslieDach, communications director for the Dukakis campaign.   But Dach said that, while Dukakis will have some surrogatespeakers, he will not field anywhere near the number that Bush isusing.   ``Ultimately, this kind of tactic is not going to work. GeorgeBush's problem is he hasn't articulated his own vision of thefuture. And that's what people want in a president, they're notlooking for somebody who can organize a hit squad,'' Dach said.   Although surrogates have been used before, including elected GOPofficials who spoke out vociferously in 1984 in behalf of PresidentReagan's re-election effort, the Bush campaign is seeking to turnthe practice into a science _ carefully targeting speakers tosubjects and audiences.   ``We have about 10 out there now. By the fall, we'll have 100,''said Alixe Glen, a Bush spokeswoman.   Bush, who says the surrogate speakers will play a vital part inhis campaign, told reporters last week that he thinks thedifferences between him and Dukakis remain out of focus _ andthat's where the surrogate speakers will help.   ``I've got to spell it out (the differences) and get surrogates_ those other people who believe as I do _ to spell it out,'' Bushsaid.   Some of the surrogates have specific assignments.   For instance, New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu's marching ordersare to chip away at Dukakis' so-called ``Massachusetts miracle,''which the neighboring governor derides as the ``Massachusettsmirage.''   On Friday, for example, Sununu told reporters no one should besurprised at Dukakis' signing a $40 million cigarette tax into lawbecause ``everytime he's had a problem, he's run to a tax increase_ even when he ran the first time and gave an iron-clad commitmentthere would be no tax increase.''   Former Massachusetts Gov. Ed King is also speaking on behalf ofBush with the same message, and Illinois Gov. James Thompson andNew Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean have also been active as surrogates.   To counter his high negatives among women voters, Bush iscounting on a number of prominent GOP women, including Rep. LynnMartin of Illinois and Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas to get outthe word that he is concerned with issues that affect women.   Vanquished GOP presidential rivals Rep. Jack Kemp of New Yorkand Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas are also busy on the surrogate circuit.Dole, the Senate minority leader, ``has already been to nine stateconventions and we will be to 20,'' said Dole aide Walt Riker.``He's just crashing his way downfield.''   The Bush campaign and the Republican National Committee aresharing the expenses of the surrogate program.   But one Republican skeptical of the ultimate value of thetechnique is McCain, the Arizona senator who dogged Dukakis in theSouth.   ``The Dukakis people were clearly stunned by this,'' saidMcCain, noting that Democrats retaliated by attacking him at homefor missing Senate votes while campaigning for Bush.   ``I was gone 24 hours. I missed five votes, all of which wereeither non-essential or carried by margins such as 92-to-3.''   McCain said that surrogate speakers have been used extensivelyin the past by both parties and that he believes the concept ``ishelpful but only minimally'' to candidates.   ``That's why I was intrigued at the way Dukakis and his peopleoverreacted,'' McCain said. ``I think it's ridiculous that heresponds by saying I don't know the difference between beans andbrown bread. What kind of response is that?''   McCain, who said he does know the difference, is turning downthe RNC's offer to pay for his trip.   Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, who expects to speak extensivelyin the West, said the surrogate program is a chance to correct whathe claims are misconceptions among voters that are hurting Bush inthe polls.   ``A lot of the polls show either two-fifths or three-fifths ofthe people polled said that Dukakis was more conservative thanBush. That isn't a loss of focus, that's a loss of youreyeglasses,'' Simpson said. ``There isn't any way Dukakis is goingto pull that one off.''</TEXT></DOC>
