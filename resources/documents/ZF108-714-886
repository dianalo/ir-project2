You can make changes to the dBASEtables with the SQL UPDATE and DELETE statements.andP;  UPDATE and DELETE cancause referential integrity and other integrity exposures, leaving datavulnerable to different flavors of corruption.andM;Reports and other text output can be sent to any type of printer, but if youwant graphs, you'll need an HP LaserJet II or compatible.andM;Query includes DOS 3.1 multiuser support for networks.andP;  All file and recordlocks are handled automatically to prevent data collisions by LAN users.andM;The system requires 200K memory to run, but Query will use all availablememory up to 640K to speed execution.andM;YSC Tech also offers an OS/2 version of Query that uses 80386 protected mode.andO;This version is functionally the same as the DOS version.andM;There are good programmers and there are good documentors, but rarely in thesame person.andP;  Query's documentation leaves a lot to be desired.andP;  Thestandard, three-ring, black binder with a white sticker on the cover thatposed as a manual is poorly written with no examples of the output you shouldexpect to see or produce.andM;For knowledgeable SQL users who can get by with little documentation and havean understanding of SQL and dBASE III PLUS, Query could be the answer you'relooking for to generate good-looking, ad hoe graphs from your dBASE Ill PLUSand dBASE IV databases.andP;  For the rest of the world trying to learn SQL, thisisn't the place to start.andP;  The stiff hardware requirements might prevent someof us from using Query's graphing abilities.andM;Query requires an IBM PC-, XT-, AT-, or PS/2-compatible.andM;Query version 2.1 sells for $88 plus $3 shipping.andP;  It comes with a 30-daymoney-back guarantee and free technical support.andM;- Jeffrey BersinandM;YSC Tech 47 Protea Gardens Willowdale, Ontario M2K 2W5 Canada (416) 733-0228</TEXT></DOC>
