As part of a wide-ranging scheme uncovered by the government, some of the former Wedtech officials also admitted to conspiring to bribe other federal, state and city officials, defrauding Wedtech shareholders through false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission and filing $5 million in false bills with the Defense Department.    Separately, in Manhattan state court, a former commander of the state National Guard, Maj. Gen. Vito J. Castellano, was charged with taking bribes from a former Wedtech attorney, Bernard Ehrlich, to lobby for the company. He agreed to plea guilty to tax evasion and filing a false tax return, prosecutors said. Mr. Ehrlich pleaded innocent.    Wedtech, once a Bronx success story, recently came under federal and state scrutiny for its success in obtaining no-bid Defense Department contracts through the Small Business Administration. Wedtech won about $494 million in defense contracts starting in 1975 by falsely portraying itself as a minority-owned small business, the government charged. The firm makes bridge supports, small machines and spare parts for the military.    The four former officials who pleaded guilty left Wedtech last month. They are: Fred Neuberger, 56 years old, former chairman; Mario Morino, 45, former treasurer and vice president; Anthony Guariglia, 36, former chief financial officer and president; and Lawrence Shorten, 40, formerly a senior vice president in charge of marketing and international operations.    Wedtech filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection Dec. 14 after it lost a major Navy contract and received unfavorable publicity about the criminal probes into its connections with current and former public officials. Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate with protection from creditors' lawsuits while working out a plan to pay debt.    The four men pleaded guilty Jan. 30 in federal court before Judge Charles E. Stewart. The indictment and guilty pleas were sealed until yesterday.    The public officials allegedly involved in yesterday's charges weren't named in court papers. Details of the Wedtech scheme were disclosed yesterday by state prosecutors in the Bronx and U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani in Manhattan.    According to Mario Merola, Bronx district attorney, the former Wedtech officials each pleaded guilty in state court to one count of second-degree grand larceny for the theft of money from Wedtech and its predecessor company, Welbilt Electronic Die Corp. Each of the men admitted to misappropriating &quot;in excess of $500,000&quot; from Wedtech.    All four admitted to a conspiracy count involving a $50,000 bribe paid to an unidentified New York City official.    On the federal charges, the former Wedtech officials face sentences ranging from five to 15 years in prison and fines of as much as $750,000.    All four men are cooperating with the government's continuing investigation. Mr. Giuliani said current Wedtech management and attorneys have cooperated in the joint investigation and have &quot;been of great assistance.&quot;    Martin R. Pollner, corporate counsel for Wedtech, said, &quot;it is clear that the allegations are limited to past conduct of certain former officers and directors rather than the corporation itself, its new management team or Wedtech's present operation.&quot;    In Washington, meanwhile, Attorney General Edwin Meese testified on Capitol Hill yesterday about his knowledge of Wedtech's efforts to win federal contracts in 1982, when Mr. Meese served as counselor to the president.    Acknowledging that &quot;I may have known at the time&quot; about former White House aide Lyn Nofziger's efforts on behalf of the company, Mr. Meese said &quot;I have no knowledge, that I recall, of anything being done improperly.&quot; An independent counsel requested by the Justice Department is investigating whether Mr. Nofziger violated federal ethics laws. </TEXT></DOC>
