On the other hand, Mr.Milken has an enormous opportunity. Federal judges in NewYork have been reversing other white-collar convictions byformer U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani as quickly as lawyerscan file the appeals.   Mr. Dershowitz, whose bestselling &quot;Chutzpah&quot; describes hisusual credo, sounds rather modest as he prepares advice duein a month to Mr. Milken and his main lawyer, Arthur Liman.Instead of withdrawing the plea bargain altogether, it'slikely the Milken team would settle for a reduction in theoutlandish jail sentence of 10 years plus three years offull-time community service.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Dershowitz and his team of Harvard Law talent hope toforce the appeals court and trial Judge Kimba Wood to answerthese questions: What rubber hoses caused Mr. Milken to pleabargain? And isn't his jail sentence disproportional? Thesequestions are easier to answer now that appeals courts inother cases have seen others commit more serious crimes,&quot;cooperate&quot; with prosecutors by delivering perjury and berewarded with jail time a fraction of Mr. Milken's.   The civil-rights violations started with what Mr.Dershowitz calls &quot;the RICOizing of business practices thatwere prevalent on Wall Street.&quot; Prosecutors also held Mr.Milken's brother hostage to the racketeering indictment,threatened criminal charges in every state, dispatched an FBIagent to harass Mr. Milken's grandfather and tried to stopDrexel Burnham Lambert from giving Mr. Milken his back pay.   Mr. Milken's six-count plea bargain includes such arcane&quot;crimes&quot; as aiding and abetting someone else's false filing,as if Mr. Milken vetted the securities disclosures of thethousands of people on the other side of his trades. The pleadoes not include insider trading or any junk-bond fraud.Especially now that judges have reversed several otherconvictions, Mr. Milken's jail term is greater than thesentences for the other major Wall Street figures combined.   Mr. Dershowitz understands why Mr. Giuliani tried so hardto transform what had been civil offenses into criminalcharges. &quot;Mr. Giuliani is most proud of being an imaginativeprosecutor who used the criminal law to change the rules,&quot;Mr. Dershowitz says. &quot;It's like Robert Bork's complaint aboutjudicial activists. As with judges, prosecutors should havethe patience in a democracy to rely on the legislativeprocess to change the laws if they don't like them.&quot; If Mr.Giuliani didn't like junk bonds or takeovers, he should haverun for office sooner.   Mr. Boesky was the main source for the Milken indictment,which charged serious offenses, including insider trading.But how believable was he? One answer is that prosecutorsrefused to call Mr. Boesky to testify at Mr. Milken'spre-sentencing hearing. Drexel trader Peter Gardiner didtestify about Mr. Milken's alleged stock manipulation, butanother prosecution witness contradicted Mr. Gardiner, whohimself changed earlier testimony. Judge Wood said governmentwitnesses were less than &quot;wholly credible.&quot;   There is a special danger in these kinds of cases becauseit's so easy to concoct a false accusation, especially ifprosecutors offer a choice of RICO or testifying againstsomeone else. Unlike in the case of murder, the differencebetween a legal and allegedly illegal act of stockmanipulation is whose explanation of the motive for thetransaction prosecutors want to believe.   John Mulheren Jr. was convicted for manipulating the shareprice of Gulf andamp; Western by buying stock with the sole purposeof helping Mr. Boesky, who was the main witness against him.&quot;Although we harbor doubts about the government's theory ofprosecution,&quot; the judges said, they reversed &quot;because we areconvinced that no rational trier of fact could have found theelements of the crimes charged here beyond a reasonabledoubt.&quot; Mr. Mulheren had his own reasons for buying thestock, including to cover his short position.   Indeed, the Mulheren case is a reminder that Mr. Boesky'sgreatest insider-trading coup was the deal he cut withprosecutors. This prosecution was also his only appearance onthe witness stand, which included this exchange:   &quot;And those were the only two lies that you can rememberthat you've told?&quot;   &quot;I don't know. Other lies. I'm sure I have lied more thanthat.&quot;   &quot;Have you lied more than 1,000 times, Mr. Boesky?&quot;   &quot;The answer is very simply, sir, I've lied more thantwice. I can't tell you how many times more than twice.   &quot;Have you lied 900 times?&quot;   Perjury was also key to reversing the RICO convictionsagainst Robert Wallach. Prosecutors argued that their starwitness, Wedtech officer Anthony Guariglia, might have boughtgambling chips in a casino, but he didn't gamble. &quot;We fearthat given the importance of Guariglia's testimony to thecase,&quot; the appeals court said, &quot;the prosecutors may haveconsciously avoided recognizing the obvious -- that is, thatGuariglia was not telling the truth.&quot;   Then there was apparent perjury in the stock-manipulationconviction of GAF and its James Sherwin. The supposed keyevidence of the manipulation of Union Carbide stock by 1/8point was a telephone call confirming the trade. Prose cutorsassured that the call was made, but that no phone recordsexisted. Defense lawyers unearthed records from an ATandamp;T vaultthat showed no such call occurred. Judge Daniel Mahoney saidit was &quot;disturb ing&quot; that prosecu tors still refuse to investigate apparent perjury by their witness.   These prosecutorial abuses are not news to the nearly halfof the federal appeals judges for New York who have been onthe three-judge panels that reversed Mr. Giuliani'sdecade-of-greed prosecutions. Still, Ivan Boesky and theother inside traders now walk free, while Mr. Giulianiprepares to run again for mayor of New York City.   Meanwhile, Mr. Milken spends his days cleaning toilets andmopping floors at a remote federal work prison. The judgesstill have some justice to do.</TEXT></DOC>
