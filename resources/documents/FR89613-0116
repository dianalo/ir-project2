Applicant is a Massachusetts business trust currently registered underthe 1940 Act as an open-end management investment company. Applicant hasestablished and currently offers shares in twelve investment portfolios.Eleven of these portfolios are stock and bond funds (each individuallyan ``Acquiring Fund'' or collectively ``Acquiring Funds''). The twelfthportfolio is a money market fund (the ``Money Market Fund''). First InterstateBank of Denver, N.A. (``FIBD'') and First Interstate Bank of Oregon, N.A.(``FIOR'') serve as investment advisers to the Acquiring Funds. FIBD andFIOR are each wholly-owned bank subsidiaries of First Interstate Bancorp,a publicly-held, multi-state bank holding company. Denver Investment Advisors,Inc. (``Denver Investment''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FIBD, servesas sub-advisor to certain of the Acquiring Funds. In addition, Denver Investmentserves as investment adviser to the Money Market Fund (``FIBD, FIOR andDenver Investment are sometimes referred to as the ``Advisers''). ALPSSecurities, Inc. (``ALPS'') serves as administrator and distributor forthe Applicant. It is requested that the order sought extend to any subsequentlycreated series of Applicant which will avail itself of such prospectiverelief only upon the terms and conditions set forth in the application.2. The Money Market Fund invests solely in U.S. dollar denominated debtsecurities determined to be of high quality and present minimal creditrisk, and is designed as a cash reserve investment vehicle. Each AcquiringFund invests its assets principally in either equity or non-money marketdebt securities. The Acquiring Funds may have relatively small cash reservesemanating from a variety of sources, including interest and dividends receivedon portfolio securities, unsettled or ``failed'' securities transactions,reserves held for investment strategy purposes, cash arising from the liquidationof investment securities to meet anticipated redemptions, and new moniesreceived from investors.3. The Advisers will be in the unique and best position to know at anygiven moment the cash balances held by each Acquiring Fund, to know thepurpose and need for these balances, and to make and implement decisionswith respect to the investment of these balances. If the requested orderis granted, the Advisers could immediately invest the Acquiring Funds'uninvested monies into the Money Market Fund while considering the purchaseof appropriate portfolio securities for the Acquiring Funds. If each Serieswere required to invest small cash balances directly in money market instruments,rather than purchasing shares of the Money Market Fund, each Series islikely to be adversely affected by a lower return and reduced and lostinvestment opportunities. The securities in which the Acquiring Funds investare normally unavailable in small lots and it often proves impracticalto invest the small cash balances of the Acquiring Funds.4. The proposed transactions will comply with the limitations set forthin section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act and will not result in layering ofadvisory or administrative fees. Each Acquiring Fund has agreed to payan advisory fee to the Advisers; however, the Money Market Fund does notpay an advisory fee. ALPS, as administrator and distributor for both theAcquiring Funds and the Money Market Fund, is entitled to receive feesfrom each portfolio for its administrative services at a maximum annualrate of .05 percent of the average net assets of each Acquiring Fund. (ALPSis not entitled to any fee for its services as distributor.) ALPS willwaive its administrative fees with respect to the Acquiring Funds to theextent attributable to the net assets of the Money Market Fund held bythe Acquiring Funds. To effect the waiver, the net asset value of eachAcquiring Fund's holdings in the Money Market Fund will be excluded fromthe net asset value of the Acquiring Fund in the calculation of its fees.Similarly, should the Money Market Fund ever pay an advisory fee to theAdvisers in the future, advisory fees payable by the Acquiring Funds tothe Advisers would be waived in a manner identical to the waiver proposedabove for administrative fees. The Money Market Fund does not impose afee pursuant to a plan adopted under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act. Sincethe Acquiring Funds retain the freedom to invest some or all of their cashbalances directly in money market instruments, there exists an independentcheck upon the investment of the Acquiring Funds' assets in an investmentwhich produces a non-competitive rate of return. Conversely, the MoneyMarket Fund reserves the right to discontinue selling shares to the AcquiringFunds if such sales adversely affect its portfolio management and operations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant's Legal Analysis</ITAG>1. Applicant requests an order pursuant to sections 6(c), 17(b) and 17(d)of the 1940 Act, and Rule 17d-1 thereunder, to permit the Money MarketFund to sell to, and redeem its shares from, the Acquiring Funds and topermit the Advisers, to effect such purchases and sales of shares of theMoney Market Fund by the Acquiring Funds. Because the Applicant's seriesare controlled by the same Board of Trustees, and have the same administratorand distributor and also have affiliated Advisers, the Money Market Fundand Acquiring Funds may be deemed affiliated persons within the meaningof section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act. Therefore, the issuance of Money MarketFund shares to the Acquiring Funds may be deemed a sale of securities toregistered investment companies by an affiliated person of such companiesin violation of section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act. Conversely, the redemptionby Money Market Fund of its shares may be deemed a purchase of securitiesby a registered investment company from affiliated persons thereof, inviolation of section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. Finally, the contemplatedtransactions may be deemed a joint arrangement requiring prior SEC approvalunder Rule 17d-1.2. The proposed transactions satisfy the section 17(b) standard for exemptionfrom section 17(a). In this regard, Applicant points out that the considerationpaid and received for the sale and redemption of Money Market Fund sharesis their net asset value and therefore is reasonable and does not involveoverreaching on the part of the Acquiring Funds or the Money Market Fund.Moreover, the proposed arrangement does not involve the imposition of doubleadvisory or administrative fees on the Acquiring Funds. Applicant alsosubmits that the investment of the Acquiring Funds in Money Market Fundshares and issuance of Money Market Fund shares to the Acquiring Fundsis consistent with their policies as recited in the Applicant's prospectuses.3. Applicant contends that it has considered the relative benefits to theAcquiring Funds and to the Money Market Fund to be derived from the proposedarrangement and determined that operating in this proposed manner wouldbe beneficial to each series and that there is no basis on which to predictgreater benefit to any one series than to another. Applicant also contendsthat the Acquiring Funds participate in the arrangement on the same basiswith one another and do not participate on a basis which is different fromor less advantageous than one another. Applicant represents that to theextent the Money Market Fund participates on a basis which is differentfrom or less advantageous than (or more advantageous than) the AcquiringFunds, the relative advantages and/or disadvantages vary randomly overtime are within a range of fairness. Applicant notes that although theAcquiring Funds may derive administrative convenience and a nominal costsavings, the most significant benefit to the Acquiring Funds is the eliminationof the need to maintain relatively small sums of money in cash. Finally,Applicant contends there are no ``conflicts of interest'' between or amongthe series, and there is no inherent bias favoring one series over another.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant's Conditions</ITAG>If the requested order is granted, Applicant agrees to the following conditions:1. The Money Market Fund will calculate its net asset value in accordancewith Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act. 2.

Each Acquiring Fund will purchase shares of the Money Market Fund withinthe limits of section 12(d) of the 1940 Act. 4. ALPS will waive its administrative fees with respect to the AcquiringFunds to the extent attributable to the net assets of the Money MarketFund held by the Acquiring Funds.5. The Applicant will vote the number of Money Market Fund shares thatare owned by the Acquiring Funds and are entitled to vote in regard tosuch matter in the same proportion as the votes of all other Money MarketFund shareholders.6. The Acquiring Funds will purchase and redeem shares of the Money MarketFund as of the same time and at the same price, and will receive dividendsand bear their proportionate share of expenses on the same basis, as othershareholders of the Money Market Fund. A separate account will be establishedin the shareholder records of the Money Market Fund for each AcquiringFund.7. The investment by the Acquiring Funds in shares of the Money MarketFund will be in accordance with each Fund's investment restrictions andwill be consistent with their policies as recited in each Fund's registrationstatement and prospectus.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant todelegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
