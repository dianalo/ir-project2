Col. William Higgins, a U.N. peacekeeper,provoked ``outrage and revulsion'' today from Secretary-GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar.   Also today, the Security Council unanimously passed a resolutionthat ``condemns unequivocally all acts of hostage-taking andabduction,'' and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellardenounced Israel's capture of a Shiite cleric.   The Security Council was also scheduled today to extend for sixmonths the mandate of its peacekeepers in Lebanon, the U.N. InterimForce in Lebanon.   Higgins' Shiite captors announced today that they carried outtheir threat to hang him and issued a videotape purporting to showhis slaying.   The U.N. chief's spokesman, Juan-Carlos Brandt, said that if thereport is confirmed, ``the secretary-general can only express hisoutrage and revulsion at the fact that an innocent man serving theUnited Nations in the cause of peace should be murdered in thisfashion,'' said Brandt.   The resolution, which has been debated in private in the councilfor weeks, ``demands the immediate safe release of all hostages andabducted persons wherever and by whomever they are being held.''   It calls on all nations to use their political influence for therelease of hostages, and urges international cooperation to``facilitate the prevention, prosecution and punishment of all actsof hostage-taking and abduction as manifestations of terrorism.''   Higgins, 44, was serving as head of an observer group attachedto the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when he was seizedFeb. 17, 1988.   Higgins' captors, a shadowy pro-Iranian group called theOrganization of the Oppressed on Earth, accused him of spying forthe CIA.   The kidnappers said they would hang him today unless Israelfreed Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, an influential Shiite Moslem clericcaptured by Israeli troops three days ago. Perez de Cuellarcondemned Obeid's capture.   Obeid is the reputed spiritual leader of the Shiite MoslemHezbollah militia in south Lebanon, the umbrella group for factionsbelieved to be holding 17 foreign hostages in Lebanon, nine of themAmericans.   Lebanese security sources and Israeli officials say Obeid playeda role in the kidnapping of Higgins last year, but Obeid denies it.</TEXT></DOC>
