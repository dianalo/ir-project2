The bank said the loan will help back energy pricing revisions and continuing efforts by the Turkish government to get more private business participation in the production and distribution of energy products.    In other action, the World Bank cleared two loans totaling $205 million for Mexico to help finance small and medium-sized industrial enterprises and to improve agricultural output through technical training programs for farmers.    Zaire will receive $161 million in low-cost credits from the World Bank's International Development Association affiliate and the bank's special African fund to support structural economic adjustments. The World Bank said Japan will provide $15.9 million in special joint-financing loans and grants for the structural economic adjustments.    Brazil will receive a $100 million World Bank loan to rehabilitate the state-controlled railroad system serving the industrial areas of Sao Paulo and the port of Santos. Niger will get $80 million from the IDA and the World Bank African fund to support economic reforms.    The World Bank loans will be at variable lending rates; the IDA credits and the money provided through the bank's special African fund will be interest-free except for administrative fees. </TEXT></DOC>
