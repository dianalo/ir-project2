The imminent shipment of these switches was announced byWilliam Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer of UnitedTelecommunications Inc., shortly after completing a visit tothe Soviet Union with Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher andthe chief executives of other U.S. companies. UnitedTelecommunications, of Westwood, Kan., is the parent of USSprint.</LP><TEXT>   The export license that US Sprint expects to obtain asearly as this week will be the first license fortelecommunications equipment granted by the U.S. under thenew, relaxed regulations for shipping technology to theSoviet Union, Mr. Esrey said.   The Soviet venture, Telenet USSR, will be owned by a USSprint subsidiary, Sprint International, and the SovietMinistry of Post and Telecommunications and the LarvianAcademy of Sciences, a Soviet research group.   The Commerce Department doesn't discuss details ofindividual license applications, but Mr. Mosbacher haspublicly supported technology tie-ups between the U.S.companies represented in his traveling group and potentialSoviet partners.   US Sprint appears to be leading the race among Americantelecommunications companies to establish solid ties in theSoviet Union. An earlier proposal by U S West Inc. to laydown part of an international fiber-optic line across theSoviet Union was rejected by U.S. authorities because of theadvanced nature of the technology.   US Sprint's packet switches, however, appear to be withinthe new standards for permissible exports to the SovietUnion. The switches are used to route telephone calls andcontrol traffic in voice, facsimile and digitalized datatransmission. These eight-bit switches are one or twogenerations behind the comparable systems in use in Westerncountries, but are still good enough to sharply improve theability of Sprint's Soviet customers to communicate withother countries, Mr. Esrey's aides said. The company declinedto discuss the value of its investment or to disclose howmany switches will be sold.   US Sprint said its venture will operate through new,dedicated satellite lines that will augment theoften-congested 32 international lines that currently existfor Moscow-based businesses. Mr. Esrey said he expects theventure to be in operation before the end of this year.</TEXT></DOC>
