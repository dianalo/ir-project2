The agreements, which cover loans from 30 lenders for about 250 properties, represent one of the largest real estate debt restructurings since the nationwide real estate crash in the mid-1970s, lenders believe.    Closely held Vantage, which has been hurt by rent concessions and high vacancies in the overbuilt Southwest, chose to restructure all its loans at one time rather than adopt the piece-meal approach being used by other battered developers. &quot;What they didn't want to do was go through a series of postings,&quot; said one lender.    John Eulich, chairman of Vantage, said the company still was negotiating with its remaining lenders, but that they &quot;have problems of their own.&quot; He declined to identify those lenders.    In general, Mr. Eulich said, the agreements stretch out the loan payments on the company's short-term bank debt and defer or reduce interest payments on the long-term mortgages held by its insurance-company lenders.    New York's Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. and Dallas-based First RepublicBank Corp. are Vantage's main bank lenders, with about half the company's total debt. Hartford, Conn.-based Travelers Corp. and Prudential Insurance Co. of America, Newark, N.J., hold most of the company's long-term mortgages, and Travelers is a partner in five large joint ventures.    Robert Lisle, Travelers' senior vice president in charge of real estate, said that for some of the properties, the insurance company agreed to reduce debt payments and to carry interest charges.    The agreements were designed to carry Vantage through periods of free rent given as an inducement to some Vantage tenants. &quot;It was purely the give-ups the whole industry was giving that was causing the cash flow problems,&quot; said Mr. Lisle.    Faced with the rapidly worsening Southwest real estate market, Vantage approached some of its lenders last October with a request to restructure its debt and in March presented a formal plan for the restructuring. Mr. Eulich said that at the time, it was never in default on any of the loans nor had any of the lenders called in their loans.    However in July, Dallas-based First Texas Savings Association posted for foreclosure a 240,000-square-foot office building, seeking to accelerate payment on Vantage's $36.2 million note on the property. First Texas and Vantage reached an agreement on the loan and the property wasn't foreclosed.    Mr. Eulich said Vantage hadn't missed a payment on the loan and described the posting as a &quot;technical default&quot; used to bring the company to the negotiating table. &quot;It did embarrass us,&quot; Mr. Eulich said. A First Texas executive declined to comment.    Founded by Mr. Eulich in 1959, the company has developed about $6 billion of commercial and industrial properties-initially industrial warehouses and showrooms and later office and retail buildings. In the past year, Vantage has trimmed costs by cutting jobs and selling its hotel unit and its construction subsidiary. </TEXT></DOC>
