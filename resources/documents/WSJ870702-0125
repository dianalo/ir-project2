The report, requested by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, looks at U.S. competitiveness in such service industries as banking, information technologies, engineering and construction. It concludes that the U.S. remains competitive in all these areas, but is being challenged by the Japanese and others, particularly in banking, engineering and construction.    The new report also disputes the argument that a growing service sector can replace manufacturing as a base for the U.S. economy.    &quot;The services and manufacturing sectors depend on one another, both domestically and internationally,&quot; the agency said in a press release accompanying the 400-page report. &quot;To maintain an affluent society, with large numbers of well-paying jobs, the United States must remain competitive in both high-value-added goods and knowledge-based services.&quot;    The report also criticized official government statistics on service industries, saying they vastly underestimate exports of services. In 1984, for instance, exports of services totaled between $69 billion and $91 billion, said the report, far higher than the official $44 billion reported by the Commerce Department.    But while exports of services are larger than government estimates, they create relatively few jobs, according to the report. That's because U.S.-based service companies do more business overseas through foreign affiliates than they do through direct exporting.    Government statistics on high-technology information services are particularly weak, the report said. &quot;The data on services trade are poorest for precisely those industries -- the knowledge-based services -- where the United States should have the greatest dynamic comparative advantage, and where the greatest strategic benefits for other American industries lie.&quot;    In an effort to improve its data on services trade, the Commerce Department is surveying 20,000 large companies on their overseas activities. The survey was mailed last week, and results aren't expected to be released until the fall of next year.    The bureau also hopes to conduct an annual survey on services trade, but hasn't yet received permission from the Office of Management and Budget to do so.    &quot;We gather much more information on manufacturing than on services,&quot; acknowledged Larry Moran, public information officer for the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Affairs. &quot;There's clearly a gap, and we are taking steps to close that gap.&quot;    Eliminating barriers to trade in services has become a top priority of administration trade officials in the past few years, but the effort has been hampered by the lack of reliable economic data on services. </TEXT></DOC>
