Some of those rules were written in the Chicago MercantileExchange rule book. Others were simply practices devised by ahost of harried exchange members, at all levels, who werestruggling to cope with a crush of customer orders in thego-go 1980s.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I went according to the system,&quot; Mr. Cali says. &quot;I didn'tget rich, and I didn't steal any money.&quot;   But prosecutors have a darker view of Mr. Cali: To them,he is a key defendant among the 14 traders of Japanese-yenfutures who go on trial beginning today for allegedlystealing customer profits.   The 39-year-old Mr. Cali, a thin, softspoken man, facestwo counts of racketeering, and more than 90 counts of fraudand violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. He could beimprisoned for as long as 20 years if found guilty ofracketeering by the 12-member jury in federal district courtin Chicago.   Mr. Cali certainly doesn't fit the popular image of afutures trader as a high-rolling Prince of the Pits. He sayshe never made more than $65,000 to $70,000 a year as aChicago Mercantile Exchange broker. Not bad for a high-schoolgraduate. But not much compared with the six- andseven-figure annual incomes reaped by the biggest brokers inthe yen pit.   Nor does Mr. Cali live in an exclusive suburb or drive aflashy car. To pay his legal bills, he is being forced tosell a four-bedroom, two-story colonial home in thismiddle-class suburb northwest of Chicago. Until he had togive up his leased exchange seat recently, Mr. Cali left homefor the Merc every morning at 5:45 a.m. in a five-year oldVolvo that now has 90,000 miles on it.   Mr. Cali's relatively modest circumstances, and thesimilar life styles of many of the other traders on trial,highlight the difference between the Chicago futures-pitprobe and the Wall Street insider-trading investigation ofthe past few years. In New York, insider-trading charges sentmultimillionaire investors such as Ivan Boesky to jail.   In Chicago, the trial's scope has raised questions aboutthe government's willingness to pursue the worst offenders.Critics charge that despite its claims to the contrary, thegovernment is content to see just small fry jailed in orderto scare the markets into reform. The Merc's 14 yen tradersare among 48 people indicted last year in a government stingoperation aimed at rooting out alleged fraud in the futurespits.   Next week, opening statements will be heard in a separatetrial of 10 soybean-futures traders from the Chicago Board ofTrade who are charged with stealing customer trading profits.An 11th trader, Scott Anixter, pleaded guilty yesterday tofour misdemeanor charges against him in the case, and agreedto cooperate with the government's probe of soybean traders.   Nine of the 19 soybean-futures traders indicted last yearhave pleaded guilty to reduced charges in return for agreeingto cooperate with the probe. Six of the 21 indictedyen-futures traders have pleaded guilty. A seventh yen traderpleaded no contest to the government charges and is alsocooperating with the investigation.   The yen and soybean trials, each expected to take at leastfour months, will cover ground similar to an earlier casethis summer that resulted in a mixed verdict. In that case, afederal jury in Chicago convicted two out of threeSwiss-franc traders of a total of eight trading violations,but remained deadlocked on two-thirds of more than 100charges against the three.   Many of the pending charges allege that pit brokersroutinely avoided having to pay for trading errors byinducing an independent &quot;local&quot; trader in the pit to take alosing trade into his account. The local would get repaidlater with profits or &quot;points&quot; from other customer orders.Brokers also stand accused of exploiting futures-price swingsby skimming off a slice of the profits on customer trades. Afutures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specificamount of a commodity or financial instrument at a certainprice on a specified future date.   Mr. Cali grew up on Chicago's North Side, following hisfather into the glass business after high school. In 1980 hejoined a high-school friend on the Merc trading floor tobecome a futures pit broker. A year and a half ago hefollowed another trader and close friend to the trader'sapartment building near the Merc. Once there, Mr. Cali wasconfronted by federal agents, including one who had posed forover a year as a fellow futures broker named Peter Vogel.   Mr. Cali said he knows he hasn't done anything wrong. Buthe refused to comment on any of the specific governmentcharges against him.   His attorney, Thomas Durkin of Durkin, Foster andamp; Roberts inChicago, has harshly criticized the government's use ofracketeering charges against his client, and said earlierthat Mr. Cali is innocent of all the charges. He declined tobe interviewed for this article.   Mr. Cali started small when he came to the Merc tradingfloor in 1980. He held the &quot;deck&quot; of customer orders for hishigh-school friend Dean Kaulentis, who was a broker in thelive cattle-futures trading pit at the Merc. By 1983 Mr. Calihad transferred to the Japanese yen-futures pit, one of theMerc's most boisterous and fast-growing trading arenas.Within a year he was trading as many as 1,000 yen futurescontracts for customers on a busy day, compared with 200daily when he moved into the pit.   Peter Vogel, the undercover agent whose real name wasDietrich Volk, appeared in the yen pit regularly in early1988. The agent stood in front of and one step below Mr. Caliin the stepped trading pit. Mr. Cali would chat with theagent when trading was slow. Occasionally they would havebreakfast together at Lou Mitchell's, a local restaurantpopular with Merc traders.   The agent was always asking Mr. Cali and other brokers ifhe could &quot;help them&quot; execute customer orders. &quot;I must havetold him 100 times no,&quot; Mr. Cali said. He said he turned toanother broker in the pit at one point and asked: &quot;Why isthis guy always in my face?&quot;   The government alleges that Mr. Cali did more than justsay no. When Mr. Cali was confronted by the agent and ahandful of assistant U.S. attorneys in January of 1989 at hisfriend's apartment, he said, &quot;I'm not a criminal. I mean Iam, but I'm not,&quot; according to the agent's testimony at apretrial hearing. The agent testified that Mr. Cali also toldhim of participating in specific trades that the governmentalleges were fraudulent.   After the investigation surfaced, Mr. Cali, at the Merc'srequest, quit handling customer orders and started tradingone to five contracts at a time for his own account. The Mercasked that other brokers who were targets of the governmentinvestigation do the same. Mr. Cali said his income plungedabout 80% as a result.   His wife, Hiba, recently took a job at the checkoutcounter of a local Dominick's supermarket to help keep hermind off the coming trial and to bring in some income. &quot;It'sscary,&quot; she says, sitting at the round oak kitchen table withher husband. &quot;Financially, we're busted.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
