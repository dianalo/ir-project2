One of the largest international criminal investigationsever resulted in murder charges being brought in a federalcourt here against two relatively low-level Libyanoperatives. Similar charges were filed yesterday in Britain.The two are believed to be in Libya, which won't voluntarilyturn them over. U.S. officials vowed they would &quot;track down&quot;the suspects and didn't rule out kidnapping them from Libyaor a third country. U.S. prosecutors admitted they didn'tknow when, if ever, the defendants might stand trial for thebombing, which killed 270 people, including 189 Americans.</LP><TEXT>   The Bush administration intends to follow up thelong-awaited indictment with a series of steps designed toforce Libya either to end its association with terrorists orpay a higher price for it, Bush administration officialssaid. Officials suggested that in the next few days theadministration is likely to demand that Libya begincooperating with the Pan Am prosecution and shut downterrorist groups operating there.   If Libyan leader Muammar Ghadafi doesn't cooperate,officials said, the U.S. will try to organize aninternational economic crackdown on the oil-rich nation. Thateffort would focus on trying to persuade European nations tocurtail purchases of Libyan oil and sales of manufacturedgoods to that country. The U.S. already has a virtuallycomplete economic embargo on the African nation.   Administration officials didn't rule out military actionagainst Libya, but they suggested it isn't likely.   The 193-count indictment indicates that the Libyanintelligence service was deeply involved in planning the PanAm bombing. But prosecutors refused to comment on whetherhigher-ranking Libyan officials would be charged. ActingAttorney General William Barr said the investigation willcontinue &quot;unrelentingly until all responsible are brought tojustice.&quot;   The two men named in the indictment were Abdel Basset AliAl-Megrahi, 39 years old, and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, 35. Bothwere identified as officers of Libya's Jamahirya SecurityOrganization, which prosecutors said is &quot;the intelligenceservice through which Libya conducted acts of terrorismagainst other nations.&quot;   Investigators have at different times looked into thepossibility of Syrian, Iranian and Palestinian complicity inthe bombing. But prosecutors said yesterday that they have&quot;no evidence&quot; linking Syrian, Iranian or Palestinianterrorists to the destruction of Flight 103.   The decision to avoid blaming Syria or its agents for anyrole in the bombing is certain to be controversial. Familiesof victims of the bombing have voiced suspicions that theU.S. government is reluctant to blame Syria because itdoesn't want to disrupt improving ties with Syria orjeopardize Syria's participation in American-organized MiddleEast peace talks.   Investigators once suspected the bombing was carried outby a Syrian-based Palestinian group, the Popular Front forthe Liberation of Palestine-General Command. But whileinvestigators still think that group planned to blow up anairliner, it's believed the effort was aborted when some ofits operatives were arrested in Germany in October 1988.Meanwhile, a timer on the bomb used in the Pan Am 103explosion was linked to the Libyan intelligence agents.   According to the Associated Press, Tripoli's ambassador toFrance told the British Broadcasting Service that &quot;there isno proof&quot; that Libyan agents were involved in the explosion.&quot;We are victims of terrorism and not perpetrators of it,&quot; hesaid.   U.S. officials refused yesterday to ascribe a motive inthe Pan Am bombing, but it is widely believed to be an act ofrevenge after the U.S. bombing of Libya in 1986.   In October, a French judge charged four high-rankingLibyan intelligence officials, including the brother-in-lawof Mr. Gadhafi, for a similar 1989 mid-air bombing of aFrench airliner. There have been news reports that the twobombings were planned jointly in Tripoli, Libya, in late1988, but U.S. officials refused yesterday to comment on anyconnections between the two cases.   The U.S. indictment describes a 3 1/2-year conspiracy. Theplot, involving a number of other Libyans, some named andothers not, allegedly began with the acquisition in 1985 ofspecial timing devices from a Swiss firm. The devices,fragments of which were found during a painstaking groundsearch by Scottish police, proved to be important cluesbecause Libyan terrorists had used them in other operations,the indictment said.   The defendants constructed a bomb using plastic explosivematerial and the Swiss timer, and concealed it in a Toshibaportable radio-cassette player, which, in turn, was placed ina Samsonite suitcase, the indictment said. Mr. Bassetpurchased clothing in Malta, which was also packed in thesuitcase to give it a normal appearance, the indictmentadded.   In December 1988, the defendants and their co-conspiratorsbrought the suitcase from Libya to Malta, where they acted asemployees of the Libyan national airline to place the bag onan Air Malta flight to Frankfurt, Germany, according to theindictment. In Frankfurt, the suitcase was transferred to aPan Am feeder flight to London, where the bag was put onFlight 103, which was supposed to fly to New York, theindictment said.   The indictment appears to exonerate a passenger travelingto Detroit, Khalid Jaafar, who at first was suspected ofunwittingly carrying the bomb on board in his baggage. The21-year-old Lebanese-American was killed in the crash.</TEXT></DOC>
