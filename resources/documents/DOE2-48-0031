GFCC technology was examined ineight utility systems in six geographic regions to estimate the potentialbenefits of its use. In all systems, GFCC technology was shown to havethe potential to reduce the cumulative capital costs for adding new capacity.The overall conclusion of the study is that GFCC technology offers thepotential for significant savings in many regions of the United Statesand that these benefits would appear over a wide range of economic conditions.The study provides insight into the important technological and economicfactors influencing the competitiveness of GFCC power generation.</TEXT></DOC>
