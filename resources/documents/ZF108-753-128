Given Intel's effort to kill the286 architecture, this product will probably be based on the 386architecture.andM;Applications such as notebook computers are the most demanding when it comesto minimum size, maximum functional integration, and minimum power, yet arerelatively undemanding with regard to CPU performance and peripheralinterfaces.andP;  Notebook computers typically don't have any mass-storagedevices, eliminating the need for a disk controller.andP;  Their displays arerelatively small, making the lower resolution of CGAtype graphics moreacceptable than in desktop systems.andP;  Typical notebook computer applications,such as notetaking, calendar and reminder functions, and simple spreadsheetsand databases, do not require tremendous computational power.andP;  For thesereasons, processors and system logic are likely to merge first in chipsdesigned for notebook computers.andM;With the advent of more pen-based notebook computers and more sophisticateduser interfaces, the minimum acceptable processor speed will steadily rise.andO;Multichip modules promise to provide higher performance than single-chipsystems simply because they can include much more silicon.andP;  A package nolarger than a 386 itself could include a 486 processor, a graphicscoprocessor and display controller, a disk controller, a secondary cachecontroller, and SRAMs for the cache.andM;Chips and Technologies is rumored to be developing a processor/system logicchip for notebook computers, to be announced this fall.andP;  Candamp;T pioneered thechip set business and remains a major player, but has so far depended onstandard microprocessors from Intel and other vendors of 8086 and 286processors.andP;  Candamp;T has been building a microprocessor design team for years,and has advertised extensively for architects with 8Ox86 experience.andP;  Therehave been rumors that Candamp;T is developing their own 386 microprocessor, but thecompany has steadfastly refused to comment.andM;It appears, however, that Candamp;T is close to announcing its first products thatincorporate Intel-compatible processors.andP;  Because low-end applications suchas notebook computers don't clearly require 386 compatibility, and because an8086-type processor core is much smaller and easier to develop, Candamp;T is likelyto start with such a core.andP;  This would put the Candamp;T product at a lowerprice/performance point than Intel's.andM;Another company that is likely to be pursuing the integration of amicroprocessor and support logic is AMD.andP;  AMD has the advantage of having8086 and 286 microprocessor technology in-house as a licensed alternatesource, and is widely rumored to have a 386-compatible design ready toannounce this fall.andP;  the company has been recruiting engineers with PC systemdesign experience to join a group at their Austin, Texas facility.andP;  AMD isnot yet in the chip set business, and it would make sense for them to enterthe business by taking advantage of their microprocessor capability.andM;Business ImplicationsandM;At first, the combination of microprocessors and system logic on the samechip will be limited to low-end, compact systems.andP;  Eventually, however, themajority of desktop systems are likely to use chips of this type.andM;The implications of this trend have caused considerable concern-and perhapseven a little terror-at chip set companies.andP;  Companies that don't have theresources to develop Intel-compatible processor cores could be left behind,or limited to niche markets that the highly integrated devices won't address.andM;Of all the chip set vendors, Chips and Technologies seems the most ready torise to the challenge of building processors into the chip sets.andP;  It is notyet clear if other major chip set vendors, such as Western Digital, VLSITechnology, and Headland Technology, will develop their own processor cores.andM;Western Digital was first active in the PC business as a supplier of disk andcommunication controllers.andP;  The company entered the system logic business byacquiring Faraday Electronics, and then gained display controller capabilityby purchasing Paradise Systems controller capability by purchasing ParadiseSystems.andP;  Headland Technology began as `G-2,' a spinoff from LSI Logic whichwas later merged with display controller supplier Video7.andP;  What thesecompanies need now is a source of Intel-compatible processor technology, butit's not clear whether such a supplier will emerge.andM;Intel has not been a major player in the chip set business.andP;  Early PCs usednumerous Intel peripheral chips, but this business evaporated as PCs moved tochip sets that replaced all the standard peripherals.andP;  Intel was late gettinginto the PC/AT chip set market, relying on alternate source agreements withZymos and VLSI Technology, but was the first company to ship Micro Channeland EISA chip sets.andP;  So far, however, PC/AT chip sets represent a much largerbusiness.andM;Intel seems well positioned to lead the industry in shipping combinedmicroprocessor/system logic chips, and is all but guaranteed to have asubstantial lead when it comes to 386-architecture chips.andP;  Unlike MicroChannel and EISA chip sets, the `single-chip PC' will be a very high-volumebusiness.andM;Companies that make chip sets, but not processors, are going to face toughchallenges in the next few years, but the chip set business isn't going away.andO;Today's partitioning of a standard microprocessor combined with a PC systemlogic chip set will remain a popular approach for many applications.andO;Single-chip PCs will have little advantage in high-end systems, where a fewadditional chips is not much of a concern.andM;One key benefit of not integrating the entire system on one chip is that moresystem configurations are possible.andP;  This allows system vendors todifferentiate their products from those made by their competitors using thesame chips.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
