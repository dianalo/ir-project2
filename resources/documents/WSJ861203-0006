The telecommunications concern also said it would cut capital spending sharply, beginning with a reduction in 1987 of more than $100 million, and would consolidate some of its operations.    In addition, MCI said it plans, from time to time, to buy back as many as 15 million of its 283.2 million common shares outstanding, subject to market conditions.    MCI said the one-time charge would come mainly from write-downs in the value of analog and satellite communications equipment that is being replaced with newer digital and fiber-optic equipment. MCI also said the charge would cover severance pay and other costs associated with the planned consolidation of facilities and staff. Company officials declined to say how many jobs would be eliminated.    MCI, the second-largest long-distance company, has seen its profits squeezed by rising costs and industrywide price cuts. Company officials have repeatedly said that MCI would remain profitable, but that goal has become increasingly difficult to attain.    William E. Conway Jr., MCI's senior vice president and chief financial officer, acknowledged that the company would report a fourth-quarter loss, after the charge, but he didn't indicate its magnitude. In the comparable period a year ago, MCI earned $8.3 million, or four cents a share, after unusual items.    In the third quarter, net income dropped almost 41% to $17.9 million, or six cents a share, from a year earlier. Excluding unusual items, profit was a penny a share.    MCI estimated that the moves will save more than $150 million annually in operating and depreciation expenses.    The announcement was made yesterday after the stock market closed. In national over-the-counter trading, MCI closed at $6.50, unchanged.    Some analysts criticized MCI's decision to cut capital spending at a time when its major competitors, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and US Sprint Communications Co., are maintaining or increasing their budgets. Sprint, the third-largest long-distance company, is a joint venture between GTE Corp. of Stamford, Conn. and United Telecommunications Inc. of Kansas City, Mo.    &quot;MCI is putting its market share in jeopardy by backing away from the challenge of ATandamp;T,&quot; said Robert B. Morris III, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in San Francisco. &quot;It looks like MCI is throwing in the towel.&quot;    Analysts viewed the fourth-quarter charge for equipment write-downs as a necessary part of doing business in an industry where the technology is changing rapidily. ATandamp;T said it doesn't have &quot;any plans now for a write-off of network equipment.&quot; ATandamp;T, which is accelerating plans to put new digital technology in its network and will spend about $3 billion next year, isn't faced with the same situation as MCI, analysts said. The giant-long distance company took a $3.2 billion pre-tax write-down for obsolete network equipment in 1983 prior to shedding the local phone companies.    Jack Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., questioned the wisdom of MCI's stock buyback plan, which at current market prices would cost as much as $97.5 million. &quot;I think the money may be better spent somewhere else, like in capital spending,&quot; he said.    Mr. Conway, however, defended the company's actions. He said the capital spending cuts were made possible by the efficiencies of MCI's digital network. And he characterized the plan to buy back MCI shares, which have been hovering near their two-year low, as a signal of &quot;our own confidence in the company.&quot;    Nevertheless, Mr. Grubman of PaineWebber said the moves signal a retreat by MCI. &quot;It means they don't anticipate the level of revenues over the next year or two that would allow them to remain profitable, which is why they are downsizing their company,&quot; Mr. Grubman said. </TEXT></DOC>
