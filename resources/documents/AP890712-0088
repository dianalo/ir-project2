But the White House says Bush, who last Friday permanently bannedimports of 43 styles of the weapons, has no intention of resigninghis lifetime NRA membership.   ``The president's a good, solid member of the NRA, always hasbeen, always will be,'' spokesman B. Jay Cooper said Tuesday.``We've done nothing that goes against the Second Amendment,'' whichensures the right of citizens to keep and bear arms.   Wayne LaPierre, executive director of the NRA Institute forLegislative Action, said ``a lot of people are very upset aboutthis'' because many voted for Bush because of his opposition to guncontrol laws.   ``President Bush ran on a `no more federal gun control' pledge,''LaPierre said. ``People believed that when they heard candidate Bushsay that. The pledge couldn't have been any clearer.''   The petition drive ``is not something the organization isundertaking,'' said LaPierre. But, he said, ``The sentiment iscertainly understandable ... There is an awful lot ofdisillusionment around the country.''   Anthony J. Hilder, a radio talk-show host in Anchorage who isspearheading the petition drive in Alaska, said he gathered 400signatures over the weekend at a gun show there.   Similar petition drives are under way in 22 other states and theDistrict of Columbia, Hilder said.   Bush took office maintaining there was no need for more guncontrol. But he began to reassess that view following a publicoutcry over the increasing popularity of high-powered assaultweapons among drug dealers and the slaying of five children in aStockton, Calif., schoolyard in January by a man wielding an AK-47.   First lady Barbara Bush was among those saying such guns shouldbe banned.   The Bush administration Friday banned imports of 43 styles ofsemiautomatic assault-style weapons, including the popularChinese-made AK-47 and the Israeli-made Uzi carbine.   U.S.-made weapons are not affected, but Bush called in May for amagazine limit of 15 rounds, even more stringent than the 20 roundssought in a bill pushed by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, that alsowould ban many domestic weapons.   Stephen E. Higgins, director of the Treasury Department's Bureauof Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the permanent import ban onthe 43 styles was required because the weapons did not meet thestandards imposed by the Gun Control Act of 1968. That law barsimportation of weapons that are not used for legitimate sportingpurposes.   LaPierre said it takes only one complaint by one NRA member thatanother member has violated the organization's bylaws to get aperson considered for suspension or expulsion from the NRA. Onebylaw requires that members protect and defend the Constitution, inparticular the Second Amendment.   A single NRA member can call for the expulsion of another memberby alleging a violation of NRA bylaws. The group's ethics committeeconsiders complaints.   If the committee recommends suspension or expulsion, the memberis given 30 days to request a hearing. After a hearing, thecommittee's final recommendation is considered by the 75-member NRAboard.</TEXT></DOC>
