A true compromise would not have cleared the subcommittee, as this bill did, by only a single vote more than a bare majority.    Initially, we were approached by Rep. Thomas A. Luken (D., Ohio), the subcommittee chairman, regarding a genuine compromise that would not undo the successes of the 1980 Staggers Rail Act. Although we were willing to pursue that goal in good faith, he withdrew the offer and instead introduced the so-called compromise. It is merely a modified version of the reregulation bill supported by a group calling itself Consumers United for Rail Equity or CURE. The common content of the Luken and CURE bills is evident: The only subcommittee members who voted for the Luken &quot;compromise&quot; (other than Mr. Luken) were supporters of the CURE bill.    The changes in railroad regulation contained in the Luken bill are fundamental and drastic. The bill would actually treat many rail rates within the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission as unreasonable unless proved otherwise by the railroad. This &quot;guilty until proved innocent&quot; policy would turn the Interstate Commerce Act on its head and severely reduce the pricing flexibility made possible by the Staggers Act.    Contrary to your report, the bill would not merely make it easier for &quot;captive&quot; shippers to gain access to competing railroad lines. In fact, the measure would require railroads to maintain connecting rates and routes at every &quot;actual or practicable interchange connection&quot; -- with no requirement whatsoever that the shipper be &quot;captive.&quot; Likewise, a shipper could mandate the use of one railroad's tracks by another railroad, even if that shipper &quot;has used or is using alternative transportation service.&quot; This is regulatory overkill, not relief targeted at &quot;captive&quot; shippers.    The supposed compromise would also remove from our national rail transportation policy the goal of having railroads earn revenues that are adequate to make them self-sustaining businesses. In a potential body-blow to the economy of rural and small-town America, it would impose elaborate procedural burdens that would probably halt the recent growth of short-line and regional railroads and increase the abandonment of railroad lines. Legislation such as this, which would benefit primarily coal-related interests while harming most other businesses and consumers, can be considered a compromise only if the standard is: &quot;What's mine is mine, and what's yours is negotiable.&quot;    Rep.
