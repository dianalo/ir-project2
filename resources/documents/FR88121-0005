Interested parties have been afforded an opportunity to participate inthe making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the twocomments received. The first commenter, the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, hadno objections to the proposal. The second commenter, Airbus Industrie, recommended the proposal be revisedto include the requirement that, for airplanes which had accumulated over10,000 landings, the initial inspection be accomplished within 250 landings.The intent of this suggestion was to include high-time airplanes that mightbe placed on the U.S. register in the future. The FAA does not concur.Since any Model A300 B2 airplane placed on the U.S register would haveto meet the requirements of all applicable AD's, the FAA considers thesuggested revision to be unnecessary. After careful review of the available data, including the comments notedabove, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest requirethe adoption of the following rule. It is estimated that 2 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by thisAD, that it will take approximately 1 manhour per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost will be $40 per manhour.Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD to U.S. operatorsis estimated to be $80. For the reasons discussed above, the FAA has determined that this regulationis not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291 or significantunder the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and it is further certified under thecriteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this will not have a significanteconomic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of smallentities because of the minimal cost of compliance per airplane ($40).A final evaluation has been prepared for this regulation and has been placedin the regulatory docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Aviation safety, aircraft. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
