<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-80-0645 </DOCNO><TEXT>A statistical study is presented of signatures of the high-latitude ionosphericconvection pattern and the simultaneously observed energetic electronprecipitation. Most often convection cells are found in which the sunwardflowing-region contains auroral particle precipitation but the antisunwardflowing region does not. However, observations also show the frequentoccurrence of convection cells in which neither the antisunward nor thesunward flowing plasma region contains auroral particle precipitation.These findings may appear within the dawnside or duskside convectionpattern and strongly suggest that such convection cells may be associatedwith open magnetic-field lines that thread the magnetotail lobes. Examinationof the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) data shows that this lobecell convection signature is most likely to be accompanied by the signatureof dayside merging when the IMF has a significant y component but isdirected southward. A lobe convection cell has a location and sense ofcirculation that are dependent on the sign of By. For the northern hemisphere,clockwise circulation displaced to the duskside appears roughly 35% ofthe time when By is positive, and anticlockwise circulation displacedto the dawnside appears when By is negative. The same circulation senseand location exist in the southern hemisphere for the opposite polarityof By. At times of northward IMF, the circulation within the polar capcan be at least partially on closed field lines and cannot be easilyreconciled with merely a distortion of the standard two-cell convectionpattern. The significance of these results to several models of the solarwind/magnetosphere interaction is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
