(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>As enthusiasm for the AD/Cycle development environment and SystemView systemmanagement blueprint wanes, IBM is looking to appease its MIS audience byunveiling the Information Warehouse architecture.andM;Observers note that the Information Warehouse concept which allows users ofIBM mainframes to access data stored in IBM and non-IBM database managementsystems (Software Magazine, July)--has become a fundamental requirement forMIS multivendor sites.andM;However, sources expect that IBM officials will be incapable of fullyexplaining the architecture at its unveiling because key components remainincomplete.andM;These sources blame the premature introduction on top management's pushinghard for the disclosure of the plan during the unveiling of the newestmembers of the Enterprise System (ES)/9000 mainframe family this month.andP;  IBMofficials are looking to those new computer systems to stem the sluggishsales of its newest mainframe line, which analysts blame for the recent poorfinancial results.andM;The Information Warehouse architecture is also said by observers to mark theonset of an expected IBM effort to combine its three key Systems ApplicationArchitecture (SAA) blueprints--AD/Cycle, the SystemView systems managementblue-print and the OfficeVision integrated office automation system.andM;Observers expect the Repository Manager/MVS data repository, based on the DB2mainframe relational DBMS, or a new implementation of the technology, to playa key role in joining the blueprints.andM;REPOSITORY CHANGES EXPECTEDandM;&quot;Systems software is integral to application development so why would not thetwo [AD/Cycle and SystemView] together,&quot; said David Sharon, president of CaseAssociates Inc., Oregon City, Ore.andP;  &quot;The most logical place to do that is inthe Repository.&quot;andM;Jack Nelson, vice president of Case technology at On-Line SoftwareInternational Inc., Fort Lee, N.J., noted that the Repository informationmodel currently lacks many key capabilities, including support for codegeneration, fourth-generation languages, object-oriented development andartificial intelligence technology.andM;Though the next Repository version, expected to be defined at the SeptemberInformation Warehouse briefing, will include several new features, Sharonpredicted that its capabilities will not surpass those already available inthe repository offerings of Brownstone Solutions Inc., New York City, ReltechProducts, Fairfax, Va., and InfoSpan, Edina, Minn.andM;&quot;I expect what IBM adds this fall will be as robust as those,&quot; Sharon said.andM;Some observers even expect that IBM plans, within a year, to come out with anew offering that can store data for both AD/Cycle and SystemView toeffectively replace Repository Manager/MVS.andP;  The OfficeVision platform mayalso be included, though no decision has been made yet.andM;For months prior to the formal unveiling of the Information Warehouseconcept, IBM officials were conceding that AD/Cycle and SystemView required acloser relationship.andM;Judith Teson, manager of market strategy and support in the IBM ProgrammingSystems unit, said the company is looking very hard at finding ways &quot;to makethe worker more productive [by looking] at ways of pulling all the dataandlsqb;stored in disparate DBMSs] together.&quot;andM;Teson acknowledged, during the recent Software World conference, held inToronto, that IBM users will someday be able to acquire the capabilities foraccessing and using data stored in most IBM and non-IBM DBMSs.andM;During a presentation at the conference, Teson specifically cited the AdabaseDBMS from Software AG of North America Inc., Reston, Va., the RelationalDatabase Management System from Oracle Corp., Redwood Shores, Calif., andundisclosed DBMS offerings from Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass.andO;Presumably the DEC offerings supported will include the Rdb relational DBMS,observers said.andM;&quot;We are not the IBM of 10 or 15 years ago,&quot; said Teson, who is baded in theIBM Santa Teresa laboratory, San Jose, Calif.andP;  We don't want to do it allanymore.andP;  Now we are concentrating on our strength.&quot;andM;Teson acknowledged IBM's plans for the Information Warehouse concept, alsodesignated as the Data Warehouse by some IBM officials, but declined todisclose the schedule for offering its capabilities.andM;Some observers expect that the Information Warehouse plan will createconfusion among potential AD/Cycle and SystemView users.andP;  Those observers saythe premature unveiling will cause IBM officials to remain silent on the keyInformation Warehouse technology.andM;A source described that as-yet incomplete technology as a &quot;business datadictionary,&quot; which can be expected to gradually replace the RepositoryManager/MVS offering.andP;  The new dictionary/repository offering has tentativelybeen scheduled for unveiling by mid-1992, sources said.andM;The current Repository offering, whose latest version began shipping lastspring, can still be used to prepare for the new offering, the source said.andM;Even IBM said the Repository is not yet an essential ingredient for manycompanies looking to begin implementing AD/Cycle.andP;  &quot;I hear people say that 'Ihave to have the Repository now, but there really isn't much you can do withit yet,'&quot; Teson said.andP;  &quot;From the beginning, we've said the Repository willcome in stages.&quot;andP;  For now, she said, many operations can start by installingsingle or multiple AD/Cycle-compliant Case tools.andM;This month's announcement will include the revealing of the first so-called&quot;inner-circle&quot; partner for the Information Warehouse blueprint, InformationBuilders Inc., New York City.andP;  IBI's fourth-generation language technologywill be incorporated in the links to the non-IBM databases.andM;Through August, IBM was negotiating with potential partners but had not yetreached agreements.andP;  Sources expect the inner circle to total two or threevendors by mid-September.andM;Some vendors are expected to reject overtures, claiming the price tag for anagreement is too high, sources said.andP;  IBM faced a similar circumstanceearlier this year when Legent Corp., Vienna, Va., and BMC Software Inc.,andO;Sugar Land, Texas, both turned down invitations to join the SystemView innercircle.andP;  Sources said IBM will discuss the recent SystemView difficultiesduring the upcoming announcement.andM;IBM will also continue to use technology licensed from DB Access, SantaClara, Calif., in the Information Warehouse effort.andP;  IBM currently sellsdatabase links based on the DB Access technology under an OEM pact.andM;Diana LaTour, president and chief executive of DB Access, declined to commenton the Information Warehouse plan, but did note that her firm is &quot;in fullsupport&quot; of any data access/delivery standards proposals put forth by IBM.andM;AD/CYCLE IMAGE PROBLEMSandM;Observers noted that IBM is also under the gun to boost the image ofAD/Cycle.andP;  &quot;The amount of serious interest in AD/Cycle is waning,&quot; saidChristopher Bird, president of Model Systems Inc., a Stamford, Conn.,andO;consulting firm.andP;  He expects the interest to return quickly if IBM can showusers it is on the right track again.andM;&quot;I think it is very confusing out there&quot; in the Case world, affirmed teson ofIBM.andP;  But the key goal of IBM--which Teson said has always been the toppriority--is to create &quot;a single point of control.&quot;andP;  For example, &quot;I thinkyou will see library services and the Repository moving closer together.&quot;andM;The delays in implementing the AD/Cycle blueprint, primarily due to delays indeveloping the repository, has prompted some users to look elsewhere wherefor an integrated Case system, analysts said.andM;Implementation of the AD/Cycle blueprint, Teson said has &quot;been a bigchallenge and has gone slower than we would have liked.&quot;andP;  IBM developers arealready hard at work on adding object-oriented technology to the AD/Cycleblueprint.andM;&quot;We are working on object orientation across the board,&quot; she explained.andP;  &quot;Youcan see it with our recent partnerships [as with Metaphor Systems Inc,Mountain View, Calif., and Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif.,] And Ithink you'll see Small-talk PDQ,&quot; she said.andM;Prior to IBM's acquisition of Metaphor earlier this year, the two firms hadjointly formed Patriot Partners to develop object-oriented technology.andP;  Sincethe acquisition, the Patriot Partners project has added developers from Appleunder an IBM-Apple pact.andM;The alternatives to AD/Cycle include offerings from Texas Instruments Inc.,andO;Dallas, CGI Systems Inc., Pearl River, N.Y., and AD/Cycle inner-circle memberKnowledgeWare Inc., Atlanta.andM;&quot;Relative to users, [AD/Cycle] is still a vision,&quot; said Aaron Zornes, a VP atMeta Group Inc., a Westport, Conn.-based consulting operation.andP;  He said thatthe implementation has been slowed by what he called its &quot;unprecedentedcomplexity,&quot; which includes &quot;client/server, graphical user interface anddesktop systems technology.&quot;andM;While the implementation of AD/Cycle has been slow, Teson is willing toquickly list ten directions in which the technology will go.andP;  They are:maintenance and reengineering (&quot;at the top of the list&quot;), reusability,cooperative processing, client/server, distributed local-area networks,heterogeneity, interoperability with IBM's Unix-based AIX operating system,object-oriented technology and multimedia.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
