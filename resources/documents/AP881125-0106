Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leftist leader who lost the Julypresidential election he contends was fraud-ridden, said Salinasinvited Castro and other foreign leaders to the Thursdayinauguration to legitimize his victory.   Castro will probably arrive in Mexico City the day of theceremony, according to Salinas' office.   Castro, 61, lived in the capital from mid-1955 until he and 81fellow rebels sailed for Cuba on Nov. 25, 1956, from Tuxpan on theGulf of Mexico. He has not been back to the capital since.   During his Mexican exile, Castro set up clandestine guerrillatraining camps, raised funds, stockpiled weapons and put thefinishing touches on his plans for the revolution that overthrewdictator Fulgencio Batista in January 1959.   It was also during this exile that he met the Argentinerevolutionary Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, who played a key role inBatista's overthrow. Guevara died trying to launch anotherrevolution in Bolivia in 1967.   Castro has been to Mexico only once since 1956. He held two daysof talks in the Yucatan Peninsula resort of Cancun in 1979 withthen-President Jose Lopez Portillo.   Security is expected to be tight when Castro attends theinauguration. Secretary of State George Shultz will represent theUnited States at the ceremony.   Castro is revered by much of the Mexican left. Rumors he mightattend the inauguration sparked sharp arguments in leftist circles,where some feel Castro should not endorse Salinas' victory in theJuly 6 election.   Both the right and the left accuse the governing InstitutionalRevolutionary Party of election fraud. The party, which claimedvictory with just over 50 percent of the vote, denies the charges.Cardenas was the second-place finisher.   Salinas' inauguration will be the first Mexican inaugurationattended by foreign heads of state, Salinas' office said. Only suchleaders of Latin America were invited.   So far, the presidents of Nicaragua, Argentina, Brazil, Honduras,Uruguay, and Venezuela are confirmed guests.   Cardenas said Friday that Salinas' invitations to foreign leaders``means that the government of Mexico is searching with a certaindesperation for foreign support because they don't have enoughinternal support.''   He was asked if he would advise Castro and other foreign leadersfrom attending inauguration.   ``It's up to them whether they want to lend support to anillegitimate government or if they don't want to lend support to anillegitimate government,'' he said.   Cardenas' late father, the revered former President LazaroCardenas, befriended Castro in Mexico.   Despite Mexican wariness about Castro's vow to export hisrevolution, relations between the two countries have remainedbasically sound. Mexico was the only country in Latin America thatresisted U.S. pressure to break relations with Cuba in the 1960s.   One of the rougher patches in Mexican-Cuban relations came in1983, when police arrested two Cuban diplomats with a bomb in a busyMexico City bus terminal. The two were expelled.</TEXT></DOC>
