On September21, 1989 and October 13, 1989, OCC filed amendments to its proposal. Nocomments were received. As discussed below, the Commission is approvingthe amended proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27157 (August 21, 1989),54 FR 35743.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Introduction</ITAG>OCC proposes to revise its rules to provide for the clearance and settlementof market baskets traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'').\3\<NOTE/> OCC's proposed By-laws define a ``market basket'' as a contractobligating the seller to sell and the purchaser to purchase a designatednumber of shares of each of the stocks comprising the index group on whichthe market basket is based.\4\<NOTE/> Although market basket trades are purchases and sales ofthe component basket stocks, OCC will process market basket trades as ifmarket baskets were exercised equity options, but will include market basketsas a class group within the non-equity option system for other purposes.To account for the differences between market baskets and options, OCCalso proposes to add a new set of rules and procedures designed specificallyto accommodate market baskets. These are described more fully below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ OCC's proposal is generic and would apply to all marketbasket products cleared and settled through OCC. However, because OCC'sproposal was submitted concurrently with CBOE's proposal to begin tradingtwo market basket products based on the Standard and Poor's 100 Stock PriceIndex and the Standard and Poor's 500 Stock Price Index, this release willdiscuss OCC's proposal as it relates to CBOE's market basket products.<T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27383 (October 26, 1989),File No. SR-CBOE-88-20, approving CBOE's proposal (``CBOE Approval Order'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See </T3>Article 1, Section 1(    ) of OCC's proposed By-laws.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description</ITAG>OCC proposes to revise its rules so that clearing members involved in baskettrading (``market basket clearing members'') are subject to the same generalrequirements as OCC clearing members that trade non-equity options. Forexample, any clearing member desiring to trade market baskets first wouldhave to obtain OCC's approval to do so. Before receiving such approval,each clearing member, among other things, would be required to meet OCC'sminimum initial net capital requirements.\5\<NOTE/> After receiving approval to trade market baskets, a marketbasket clearing member would have to deposit the minimum required contributionto OCC's non-equity securities clearing fund,\6\<NOTE/> and maintain the level of minimum net capital required byOCC.\7\<NOTE/> A market basket clearing member also would be required tomaintain the records prescribed by OCC \8\<NOTE/> and maintain a bank account in a clearing bank \9\<NOTE/> for each of its market basket accounts.\10\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See </T3>OCC Rule 301.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See </T3>OCC By-laws, Article VIII, section 2. Under Rule 1001(b),a market basket clearing member's minimum required non-equity securitiesclearing fund contribution is equal to the greater of (1) $75,000; or (2)the member's proportionate share of 7% of the average daily aggregate marginrequirement for non-equity securities options contracts, and market basketsoutstanding during the preceding month. Under OCC's proposal, a marketbasket clearing member's proportionate share is determined by calculatingthe member's daily average long and short positions in non-equity securitiesoptions contracts and the daily average of the net number of market basketspurchased or sold during the preceding month and dividing it by the samesum as calculated for all non-equity securities clearing members.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>See </T3>OCC Rule 302.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>See </T3>OCC Rule 207.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ A ``clearing bank'' is a bank located in a city in whichOCC has a clearing office and which has entered into an agreement withOCC for settlement of transactions on behalf of a clearing member. <T3>See </T3>OCC Rule 101(c).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ <T3>See </T3>OCC Rule 203.OCC's proposal also adds new provisions to its rules and By-laws that applyspecifically to market baskets. In many areas, these rules and By-lawsparallel those for processing equity option transactions. For example,under OCC's proposal, each exchange must report to OCC each exchange transactionin market baskets for which the purchasing clearing member and the sellingclearing member have submitted matching trade information. This reportmust identify the purchaser and seller of the market baskets, the numberof market baskets bought and sold, and the class \11\<NOTE/> and trade price of each market basket. This report also mustidentify the transaction to the clearing member's firm, market maker orcustomer account. After OCC receives this report, OCC will calculate thedifference between the price at which a member purchased or sold a marketbasket and the closing price of the component securities on that day (``cashadjustment''). OCC will net the member's cash adjustments across accountsto arrive at a net cash adjustment credit or requirement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ OCC's proposal amends OCC Rule 602A(b)(2) to set marketbaskets in a separate class group from the other non-equity options productsissued, cleared and settled at OCC. Market baskets will, however, be includedin OCC's broad-based index product group.After calculating each member's net cash adjustment, OCC will net out eachmember's market basket trades to either a net long or short position, bursteach member's net position into its underlying component securities,\12\<NOTE/> and assign each component security a price equal to its closingprice as determined by OCC's reporting authority. OCC then will reportthe above information to each market basket clearing member's designatedclearing corporation by 2:00 a.m. (Central Time). If OCC does not receivethe closing price of any of the component securities, OCC may either setthe market price of the securities based on the most recent market priceavailable for such securities or suspend the settlement obligations ofits clearing members for such securities.\13\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ The CBOE will determine the particular securities comprisingthe market basket and the number of shares of each such security in thebasket at or prior to the opening of trading on each exchange on whichthe market basket is traded.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ <T3>See </T3>OCC proposed By-Law XIX, section 5.Each market basket clearing member must deposit margin at OCC for its netbasket position by 9 a.m. (Central Time) on the day after the trade date.\1\\4\<NOTE/> Members with a net cash adjustment requirement also mustpay this amount to OCC at this time. Members with a net cash adjustmentcredit may offset their required margin deposits by this amount.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ OCC will calculate margin requirements for market basketsin essentially the same manner it makes such calculations for non-equityoptions. Accordingly, each member must pay margin consisting of two components:(1) ``Premium margin'' (which covers OCC's exposure resulting from theone day price movement in the market value of the member's net basket position),and (2) ``additional margin'' (which covers any exposure OCC may have asa result of liquidating a member's net basket position). After OCC calculatesa member's margin requirement (credit) for market baskets, it will determinethe member's product group margin requirement (credit) by combining suchrequirement (credit) with the member's margin requirements (credits) forother broad-based index options. OCC will determine a member's aggregatemargin requirement by adding the member's aggregate class group and productgroup margin requirements and (1) subtracting 50% of any credits attributableto such class groups and product groups; (2) adding (subtracting) any mark-to-marketpayments which the member has paid (collected) for its net basket position;and (3) subtracting any margin credit attributable to the member's positionin equity options. <T3>See </T3>OCC proposed Rule 602A.Each member must pay the required margin on its net basket position ona daily basis. In addition, members with net cash adjustment requirementsmust maintain such amounts on deposit with OCC until the settlement date.\1\\5\<NOTE/> Although members with net cash adjustment credits may usethese credits to offset their daily margin obligations, they may not collectthese amounts until the settlement date.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ All market basket transactions will settle on the fifthbusiness day after the trade date (``T'').After members pay their margin and net cash adjustment requirements, OCCwill ``accept'' (<T3>i.e.</T3>, guarantee) their market basket transactions and interposeitself between the parties to the transactions. OCC will deem all acceptedmarket basket positions to be in the member's firm account. OCC will reporteach member's net market basket settlement obligations to the member'sdesignated clearing corporation by 2:00 a.m. (Central Time) on the dayafter the trade date.\1\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ Each market basket clearing member must designate eitherNational Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC''), Midwest Clearing Corporation(``MCC'') or the Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia (``SCCP'')(``Clearing Corporation(s)'') as its designated clearing corporation forthe purpose of settling the deliver and receive obligations arising outof the member's market basket activity. OCC has supplemented its optionsexercise settlement agreements with the Clearing Corporations to providefor settlement of these obligations.At 1:00 p.m. (Central Time) on the day before the settlement date, OCC'ssettlement obligations for accepted market basket transactions will betransferred to each member's designated Clearing Corporation. From thatpoint forward, each member's designated Clearing Corporation will guaranteeits member's market basket settlement obligations.\1\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ <T3>See</T3> Supplement to Options Exercise Settlement Agreements betweenOCC and NSCC, MCC and SCCP dated October 26, 1989. After OCC's market basketsettlement guarantees are transferred to each member's designated ClearingCorporation, OCC will continue to calculate and collect margin from marketbasket clearing members until the settlement date. <T3>See</T3> discussion at p. 16, <T3>infra.</T3>Money and securities settlement of market baskets will occur at the member'sClearing Corporation on the settlement date. Members also will settle theirnet cash adjustment credits on the settlement date through OCC's cash settlementsystem. Any member with a net cash adjustment credit will receive thisamount from OCC at or before 10:00 a.m. (Central Time).If a certain component security is ineligible for settlement through amember's Clearing Corporation, OCC may require that the security be settledoutside the Clearing Corporation on a broker to broker basis. In addition,OCC may postpone settlement of one or more component securities comprisingthe basket if, in its opinion, such action is required because of unusualmarket conditions or is in the public interest. If OCC determines that,because of extraordinary conditions, delivery of such securities is impossibleor unduly burdensome for the delivering member, OCC may relieve the deliveringmember from its obligation to deliver such security and adjust the aggregatevalue of the market basket accordingly.\1\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ <T3>See</T3> OCC proposed By-Law XIX, Section 4.If OCC suspends any member obligated to deliver the securities comprisinga market basket before the member's Clearing Corporation becomes obligatedto effect settlement (<T3>i.e.</T3>, before 1:00 p.m. (Central Time) on the day before the settlementdate), OCC will direct a receiving member to buy-in the securities andreport the execution price of the buy-in to OCC. If the member buying insuffers a loss, OCC must satisfy the loss by 10:00 a.m. (Central Time)the following business day. If such a buy-in results in a gain, the buyingmember must pay the gain to OCC, and OCC will deposit the amount in thesuspended member's Liquidating Settlement Account.\1\\9\<NOTE/> If a member is suspended after his designated clearing corporationis obligated to effect settlement on his behalf, any amount the memberis entitled to receive is paid directly into his Liquidating SettlementAccount. These same procedures apply in reverse to a situation in whicha member obligated to receive securities is suspended from OCC.\2\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ After a member is suspended, OCC promptly convertsall of the member's margin deposits, clearing fund contributions and otherfunds subject to OCC's control to cash and deposits these funds in a LiquidatingSettlement Account in the name of the clearing member. OCC then uses thesefunds to satisfy the member's outstanding liabilities. <T3>See </T3>OCC Rule 1104.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ The Commission has received an opinion from OCC's counselstating that in the event of a suspension of a clearing member, the rightsof OCC as set forth in proposed section 3(b) of Article XIX of OCC's By-Lawswould be enforceable by OCC against the clearing member and any receiver,examiner or trustee appointed for the clearing member's estate under theSecurities Investor Protection Act of 1970 or the Bankruptcy Code, to thesame extent as if such transaction had originated in the clearing member'sfirm account and without regard to whether market basket transactions effectedby such clearing member are or have been identified in any of OCC's reportsas having originated in the customer, market-maker or other account ofthe clearing member. <T3>See</T3> letter from James R. McDaniel, Schiff, Hardin andamp; Waite,to Jonathan Kallman, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation,dated October 24, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. OCC's Rationale for the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>OCC believes its proposed rule change is consistent with the purposes andrequirements of the Act. Specifically, OCC believes that its proposal willpromote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securitiestransactions by applying to market basket transactions rules and procedurescomparable to those that have been used successfully for the clearanceand settlement of options transactions. OCC also believes that its proposalwill promote the safeguarding of funds and securities because it will applyto market baskets a system of safeguards which is substantially the sameas those that OCC currently uses for options.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion</ITAG>The Commission believes that OCC's proposal is consistent with section17A of the Act and with OCC's obligation to promote the prompt and accurateclearance and settlement of securities transactions and to safeguard fundsand securities in OCC's custody and control. Accordingly, the Commissionis approving OCC's proposal for the reasons provided below.The Commission believes that market basket trading will benefit the financialmarkets. Indeed, one of the many recommendations in the aftermath of theOctober 1987 market break was the creation of a market basket product.\2\\1\<NOTE/> Advocates of such a product believe that trading basketsof portfolios of stock may reduce the volatility and dramatic price changesin the market that are associated with index-related trading strategies.\2\\2\<NOTE/> They also believe that a specific post or posts for tradingmarket baskets will enhance the liquidity of the markets by providing amechanism for the efficient trading of portfolios of stocks.\2\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Division of Market Regulation, <T3>The October 1987 Market Break </T3>(February, 1988) (``Staff Report'')and N. Katzenbach, <T3>An Overview of Program Trading and Its Impact on Current Market Practices</T3>(December 21, 1987) (``Overview of Program Trading''). <T3>See also </T3>Report of the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms(January 1988) and The Interim Report of the President's Working Groupon Financial Markets (May 1988) for other recommendations arising out ofthe market break.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ <T3>See </T3>Overview of Program Trading at note 20. <T3>See also </T3>H. Stoll, <T3>Portfolio Trading, </T3>Working Paper No. 87-14 (September 1987) (availableat the Owen Graduate School of Management, Vanderbilt University).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ <T3>Id. </T3>For a more complete discussion of the benefits provided bythe creation and trading of market basket products, <T3>see </T3>CBOE Approval Order note 3, <T3>supra, </T3>and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27382 (October26, 1989), File No. SR-NYSE-89-05, approving the New York Stock Exchange(``NYSE'') proposal to trade a market basket product.The Commission is satisfied that OCC's proposal to clear and settle themarket basket product to be traded on the CBOE is well designed to promotethe prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of these transactionsconsistent with section 17A(b)(3) of the Act. As stated in OCC's proposal,a market basket is not a separate security;\2\\4\<NOTE/> instead, it is a contract to purchase and sell a designatednumber of shares of each of the stocks comprising the index group on whichthe market basket is based.\2\\5\<NOTE/> Thus, because the assets underlying market baskets are equitysecurities, and because the purchase and sale of a market basket resultsin an obligation to deliver or receive equity securities, the Commissionbelieves that the clearance and settlement of market basket transactionsshould be similar to the exercise and settlement of equity option transactions.As described above, OCC's proposed rules, for the most part, follow OCC'swell-established system for processing equity option transactions. Therefore,the Commission believes that OCC's proposed rules facilitate the same promptand accurate clearance and settlement of market basket transactions thatOCC's rules presently provide for equity option transactions.\2\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ <T3>See </T3>proposed section 1 (mmmm) of Article I of OCC's By-Laws.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ <T3>See </T3>CBOE approval order at 26.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ Section 31 of the Act requires each national securitiesexchange to pay certain transaction fees to the Commission. <T3>See </T3>15 U.S.C. 78ee (1982). OCC and CBOE have agreed in writingthat OCC will collect the so-called Section 31 fees attributable to marketbasket trading on CBOE's behalf and pay them to the Commission as CBOE'sagent. Although Section 31 does not specifically contemplate this arrangement,the Commission does not believe that it is inconsistent with the requirementsof Section 31. The Commission also notes that this arrangement does notaffect CBOE's obligation to pay Section 31 fees. <T3>See </T3>Section 18 of the Market Basket Supplemental Agreement betweenOCC and CBOE dated October 26, 1989.Although OCC's proposal relies heavily on its existing equity option exerciseand settlement procedures, some aspects of OCC's proposal are tailoredto fit the unique characteristics of market baskets. For example, unlikepurchases and sales of equity options, a clearing member who buys or sellsa market basket is obligated to purchase or deliver the stocks comprisingthe basket. Consequently, the Commission believes it is appropriate thatOCC's proposed rules require both the purchasing clearing member and theselling clearing member to deposit margin on the morning of the day afterthe trade date.\27\<NOTE/> Moreover, although settlement of market basket transactionsresults in the delivery or receipt of stock, OCC proposes to margin itsmembers' positions in market baskets under its non-equity option marginsystem. The Commission believes this is appropriate because OCC's non-equityoption margin system, unlike its present equity option margin system, isa ``portfolio-based'' system that provides a sophisticated method of calculatingthe amount of margin necesssary to cover the risk posed by the member'spositions.\28\<NOTE/> OCC's proposal also recognizes that the contract price ofthe basket may be greater or less than the aggregate settlement value ofthe individual stocks comprising the basket.\29\<NOTE/> OCC will use a cash adjustment to eliminate this disparity.\30\<NOTE/> This cash adjustment will settle through OCC's cash settlementsystem on the settlement date. The Commission believes this mechanism isappropriate because it simultaneously ensures that market basket clearingmembers pay the agreed upon price for a market basket while facilitatingnetting by allowing OCC to combine transactions in the same securitiesexecuted at different prices in a single netting process.\31\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ <T3>See</T3> OCC proposed Rule 602A(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ Both OCC's equity and non-equity option margin calculationsare based, in part, on options premiums. In both systems, open positionsare marked to market daily based on closing ask prices. The second componentof equity options margin, however, is based on a flat 30% of the currentvalue of the underlying securities. The second component of non-equityoption margin is more flexible and is adjusted according to the currentrisk posed to OCC by the member's position.<T3> See</T3> Staff Report at 10-50.<ITAG tagnum="28">OCC's non-equity option margin system uses options price theory toproject the cost of liquidating a member's positions in the event of anassumed ``worst-case'' change in the price of the underlying asset or index.The margin requirement on the same class of options equals the premiumplus the additional margin calculated by determining the assumed maximumone-day price movement in the underlying assets and by projecting the liquidatingvalue of such position. To provide additional protection, OCC presumesthat the cost of liquidating a member's out of the money positions wouldincrease by a minimum of 25% of the margin interval. For a further discussionof OCC's non-equity options margin system,</ITAG><T3> see</T3> OCC,<T3> The Back-up System, A Special Study by the Margin Committee Subcommittee</T3>(``Backup Report'') (August 3, 1988) at 24-41.<T3> See also</T3> Staff Report at 10-36.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ For example, assume a basket comprised of one share eachof two separate stocks. Assume each stock has a fair market value of $50\1/2\and that the purchaser buys the basket for $101.00. Further assume thateach stock has a system price (<T3>i.e.,</T3> the price used to facilitate netting) of $50 per share.Because each stock will settle at $50 per share, the seller is entitledto receive a $1.00 cash adjustment to account for the difference betweenthe basket contract price and the settlement value of the underlying stocks.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ <T3>See</T3> OCC proposed Rule 2001(b)(3).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ NSCC intends to use a similar mechanism to facilitatethe netting of transactions in the NYSE's market basket product.<T3> See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27388 (October 26, 1989),File No. SR-NSCC-89-08.Finally, OCC's proposal is designed so that market participants who buyand sell stocks through individualized stock transactions in the exchangeand over-the-counter markets and who buy or sell stock through basket tradingwill have a report that summarizes all of their previous day's tradingactivity before the beginning of trading on the following day. OCC willreport market basket transaction data to the Clearing Corporations in timefor them to include this data in position reports that are made availableto members before the opening of trading on the following day.\32\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that this aspect of OCC's proposalis beneficial because it allows market participants to have a report thatreflects all of their previous day's compared stock trades regardless ofthe marketplace in which such trades were executed or the trading vehicleused to acquire such stocks before trading commences on the following day.This, in turn, provides market participants a complete and accurate pictureof their market exposure and the credit risk \33\<NOTE/> to which they are subject. It also allows them to gauge theirfinancial commitments and allows them to adjust their trading strategyaccordingly.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ For example, NSCC will include market basket transactiondata in the reports it provides to its members in automated form throughthe current Regional Interface Operation by 8:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) onthe morning of T+1.<T3> See</T3> letter from Robert A. Schultz, Executive Vice President,NSCC, to Ross Pazzol, Attorney, Branch of Clearing Agency Regulation, Divisionof Market Regulation, dated October 19, 1989. MCC also will report marketbasket transaction data to its members by 9:00 a.m. on the morning of T+1.<T3> See </T3> letter from Jeffrey Lewis, Associate Counsel, MCC, to RossPazzol dated October 24, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transactionwill not be able to meet its obligations under the terms of the transaction.The Commission, however, believes that there is room for further improvementin OCC's market basket processing procedures. For example, as discussedbelow, the Commission believes that OCC and the Clearing Corporations couldenhance their protection against the credit risk associated with marketbasket transactions.Under OCC's proposal, OCC will assume the credit risk involved in marketbasket transactions by guaranteeing transactions upon payment of the marginon the morning of T+1 at 9:00 a.m. (Central Time). OCC also will protectagainst the market risk \34\<NOTE/> associated with market basket transactions by collectingmarket-to-market payments daily through its margin system. On T+4, eachClearing Corporation will take over OCC's guarantee by becoming the counterpartyto every market basket transaction settled through its facilities. Thisguarantee will remain in effect until settlement occurs on T+5.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ Market risk is the risk associated with the change inthe market price of a security. This risk arises where the price of thesecurity rises or falls after trade execution but before settlement. Ifthe price of the security rises and the seller does not deliver the security,the buyer may have to find another seller at a higher price. Conversely,if the price of the security falls and the buyer does not honor the trade,the seller may have to find another buyer at a lower price. Currently,stock clearing corporations such as NSCC calculate marks-to-the-marketon a daily basis but do not collect such amounts until the settlement date.The Commission believes that requiring members to make daily mark-to-the-marketpayments would provide the clearing corporation (and its members) withthe greatest degree of protection against the market risk.<T3> See</T3> Staff Report at 10-25.Under the Clearing Corporations' current rules, locked-in equity tradesare guaranteed as of midnight on T+1.\35\<NOTE/> This trade guarantee policy does not apply to exercise andsettlement of equity option transactions. Thus, because OCC's proposaltreats the clearance and settlement of market basket transactions in muchthe same way as the exercise and settlement of equity options, the ClearingCorporations' guarantee will not become effective until T+4. The Commissionunderstands that OCC will be revising its exercise settlement agreementswith the Clearing Corporations to reflect the Corporations' earlier tradeguarantees. The Commission encourages OCC to do so with a view toward providingadequate protection against Member default in a manner that does not imposeunnecessary costs on clearing members. Until such revised agreements arein effect, however, the Commission believes that OCC and the Clearing Corporationscan take certain steps to increase their protection against clearing memberdefault within the framework of their existing arrangements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\5\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27912 (August 29, 1989),54 FR 37070.As explained above, the Clearing Corporations' trade guarantee with respectto equity option transactions and market basket transactions is currentlyeffective from 1:00 p.m. on T+4 (Central Time) until settlement on T+5.OCC, however, collects margin from T+1 until settlement on T+5. The Commissionbelieves OCC should explore ways to make the margin deposited in connectionwith equity option and market basket transactions available to the ClearingCorporations (to the extent necessary to satisfy losses arising out ofequity options exercise settlement obligations and market basket transactions)from the time the Clearing Corporations' guarantee becomes effective untilsettlement. OCC could make this amount available by giving the ClearingCorporations a perfected, first lien on such amounts deposited at OCC.\36\<NOTE/> This would provide the Clearing Corporations with more directprotection against market risk than is currently provided under their existingfinancial safeguards.\37\<NOTE/> OCC's exposure would not be increased under such an arrangementbecause its loss of control over the margin on deposit would coincide withthe termination of its guarantee. After settlement of exercised equityoptions and market basket transactions at the appropriate Clearing Corporation,the Clearing Corporation's lien would be terminated and OCC would thenrelease the margin to the appropriate clearing member.\38\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ This proposal assumes that OCC would have no liabilityremaining with respect to the equity options and market basket settlementobligations it guaranteed after its guarantee is superceded by the ClearingCorporations' guarantee on T+4. If OCC retains some residual liabilityfor performance of such guaranteed settlement obligations, OCC would wantto maintain control over the margin deposited with it on T+4 and T+5 tosatisfy any contingent liability it may have with respect to such obligations.The Commission urges OCC and the Clearing Corporations to resolve thisissue expeditiously.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ OCC's margin calculations include a mark-to-market component.<T3>See</T3> note 14, <T3>supra.</T3> By contrast, each Clearing Corporation's current clearingfund calculations does not normally cover the full amount of its members'daily mark-to-market exposure. <T3>See</T3> Securities and Exchange Act Release No. 27912 (August 29,1989), 54 FR 37070. The Commission and NSCC are currently exploring, ina separate proceeding, the appropriate calculation of clearing fund requirements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ The Commission notes that OCC has not completed actionwith respect to some of the recommendations made in the Backup Report,including guaranteeing trades as they are compared, instead of making OCC'sguarantee conditional on payment of the premium. OCC has represented thatit will assess the feasiblity of moving to an earlier trade guarantee andthe corresponding increase in risks by the end of this year. Conversationbetween James Yong, Deputy General Counsel, OCC and Jonathan Kallman, AssistantDirector, Division of Market Regulation, on September 25, 1989. Thus, theCommission expects OCC to inform the Commission of the results of its assessmentand set a timetable for completing action of Backup Report recommendationsby January 1, 1990.For the reasons stated above, the Commission believes that OCC's proposalis consistent with Section 17A of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.
