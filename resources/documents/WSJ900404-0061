As part of its efforts to raise funds to satisfycreditors, Drexel is offering for sale computer databasescontaining names of its contacts at more than 4,000 firms;technical and pricing information on all the firm's publicsecurities offerings and mergers and acquisition deals in thepast several years; and its system for trading, selling andresearching high-risk, high-yield bonds.</LP><TEXT>   Steven Anreder, a spokesman for the company, said the firmhad received calls from &quot;virtually every major firm on theStreet, and others&quot; interested in buying the information.   &quot;Everybody wants to step up to the plate and take overDrexel's place in this market,&quot; says Mike Ross, a junk-bondanalyst at Blunt, Ellis andamp; Loewi. &quot;Now you've got a chance toget your hands on some of their proprietary info.&quot;Particularly valuable, he said, will be Drexel's guide topricing junk bonds, a task that has proven difficult amid therecent upheaval in the junk-bond market.   Much of the interest has come from former Drexelemployees, now at other firms, who find their new employers'analytical software inferior to Drexel's, says a spokeswomanfor Drexel's corporate finance department. Drexel hasinformation on &quot;little-known, thinly traded junk-bondofferings&quot; and has developed software to compare merger andacquisition deals in different industries for pricingpurposes, she says.   But perhaps the most desired item is the &quot;contactsdatabase,&quot; she said. &quot;People feel very strongly about gettingtheir hands on&quot; the list of &quot;financial decisionmakers at eachcompany, and what level of interest they have&quot; in buyingbonds or doing deals, according to the spokeswoman.   Drexel has already successfully, and privately, sold mostof its fixed-income bond databases, and now is anxious tosell those for mergers and acquisitions and junk bonds. &quot;Thelonger we wait to sell things, the less value they'll have,&quot;the spokeswoman said.   The databases are up for bid both separately and together.Strong interest has come from &quot;boutiques, some of the LBO{leveraged buy-out} firms, merger-and-acquisition advisersand niche players,&quot; according to the spokeswoman.   Drexel declined to provide a price estimate price for theinformation. But the auction for the databases, in WallStreet fashion, will be run like a Dutch auction. If Drexelsells its data bases to more than one buyer, the sale pricefor all buyers will be set based on an average of the highand low bids. Any firm that wants the Drexel information onan exclusive basis will have to bid more than all the otherbidders combined.</TEXT></DOC>
