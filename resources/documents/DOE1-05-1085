Thisresidual radioactivity emits ionizing radiation, thus producing a potentialhazard to personnel requiring access to the cyclotron vault and targetcave to do work. The qualitative and quantitative knowledge of theseradionuclides, together with the time dependence of residual photon dose-ratesmay be used to predict, to a reasonable degree of accuracy, the radiationenvironment after any operating regime. This in turn will help to schedulemaintenance, repair of development activities so that a maximum practicaldecay time is allowed to minimize personnel exposures.</TEXT></DOC>
