The major partsof the profiles show good agreements in shape and depth. Nevertheless,differences were observed in the near-surface region. It could be shownthat proper attention has to be paid to the vacuum environment of theinstruments and to sample preparation before evacuation in order to avoidevaporation of hydrogen containing species incorporated into the silicatestructure during leaching or weathering.</TEXT></DOC>
