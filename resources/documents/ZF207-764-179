 The strength of a page-layout package is in page designand the smooth integration of text and graphics.andP;  To be called a page-layoutpackage, the program doesn't necessarily have to do all of the textmanipulation on a page.andM;Many users, in fact, prefer to employ their favorite word processors forinputting text, adding many of the formatting chores--tabs, font changes andso on--and the importing that text file into a page-layout package.andM;The advantage of this is that users can do all of the textual work in anenvironment they already know, without having to learn another program.andM;This review covers page-layout software that imports native word-processingfile formats.andP;  The products range from basic, easy-to-use packages to complexand feature-rich programs.andM;At the high end of the spectrum, Xeros Corp.'s Ventura Publisher and AldusCorp.'s PageMaker include features essential for professional-quality desktoppublishing, such as color support and advanced typographic control.andP;  Theyalso take full advantage of laser printers and add-on font systems.andM;These programs provide extensive support of various word-processor fileformats with detailed documentation about their import functions.andM;Others, such as Timeworks Inc.'s Publish It!, International MicrocomputerSoftware Inc.'s PagePerfect and Software Publishing Corp.'s PFS:FirstPublisher, are capable products but do not offer the sophisticated featuresfound tin the high-end offerings.andP;  Consequently, their file-import functionsare less impressive.andM;In evaluating the import capabilities of these five products, a standardizedtest document was created in four formats: WordPerfect 4.2, WordPerfect 5.0,ASCII and XyWrite III Plus 3.54.andP;  Each document was imported into thedesktop-publishing programs to test the effect on any embedded formattingcodes during the process.andM;None of the page-layout programs could accurately convert all of theinformation found in each file format.andP;  Some formattingcommands--strikethrough, superscripts, subscripts and italics--were supportedinconsistently, if at all, by the page-layout packages.andM;For instance, the special formatting features of some word processors weretranslated to PageMaker with incorrect attributes in their place.andP;  Textformatted with XyWrite Inc.'s XyWrite III Plus reverse-type option becameitalic in PageMaker.andM;The new file format in WordPerfect Corp.'s WordPerfect 5.0 differs so muchfrom WordPerfect 4.2 that total rewrites of conversion algorithms wererequired.andP;  All of the desktop-publishing programs that claimed to supportWordperfect 5.0 did so correctly, with the exception of PFS-First Publisher.andM;There are alternatives to importing native word-processor file formats.andP;  Anypage-layout program can accept a word-processing document if it has beenconverted to ASCII text.andM;Some page-layout packages support IBM's Document Content Architecture (DCA),a document-exchange standard supported by many word processors.andM;However, converting a file first to ASCII or DCA and then to page-layoutformat is not as convenient as a one-step file import from the word processorto the page-layout format.andM;Supports Most FormatsandM;ALDUS CORP., PAGEMAKER 3.0, $795andM;Arguably the most popular product in the development of desktop publishingPageMaker imports a wide variety of text and graphics files--virtually allmajor word-processing and graphics packages.andM;PageMaker uses &quot;filters&quot; to import and convert and graphics.andP;  Some filtersare internal to the product and work automatically, but other--includingthose for dBASE II and Lotus 1-2-3 formats--are considered external and areselected during the installation process.andM;Aldus provides installable import filters when new or upgraded wordprocessors become available.andP;  For example, with the introduction ofWordPerfect 5.0 and its special file format, Aldus prodived a Filter DriverPack ($15) that contained a WordPerfect 5.0 import filter and new versions ofboth the printer command language and Postscript printer drivers.andM;Like Ventura Publisher, PageMaker is able to add tags to ASCII text to denotea paragraph style within PageMaker, and it can also convert the double-quotecharacter (&quot;) to so-called newspaper quotes (&quot;).andM;When testing PageMaker's native file-format capability with files created bythe two WordPerfect versions, XyWrite III Plus and ASCII formats, each filewas imported successfully with all special formatting intact.andM;While other programs give lip service in their documentation to the abilityto import files in different formats, PageMaker allocates almost 40 pages tothe subject.andP;  Users will know exactly what can be transferred and how thedocument will be interpreted by PageMaker.andP;  They do not have to guess howtheir document will appear after it is imported.andM;Aldus Corp., of Seattle, can be reached at (206) 628-2320.andM;Buyers say: Importing is no problemandM;DEspite its steep learning curve, PageMaker 3.0 is a flexible, powerfulpage-layout package, according to users.andM;Larry Shaw, a PC coordinator for Nordstrom Inc., a retail clothing chainbased in Seattle, said that PageMaker gives him the ability to createhigh-quality graphics and text for his firm's internal newsletters andbrochures.andM;Using PageMaker, Shaw is able to publish company brochures and newslettersthat combine text and high-quality graphics.andP;  He imports Microsoft Word filesto PageMaker on a regular basis and reported no problems.andM;&quot;I'd like to see good use of expanded memory,&quot; Shaw said.andP;  &quot;As far as I cantell, the program does not use any of my EMS [Expanded Memory Specification]at all.&quot;andM;Most users reported that the product was difficult to learn.andM;&quot;It's overkill in terms of how powerful it is, [so] it's not really easy tolearn,&quot; observed Shaw.andP;  &quot;While the long learning curve is a negative outcome,it also indicates how many powerful features the program has.andP;  There are somany features that most people don't take advantage of them.&quot;andM;&quot;Overall, we're happy with the program,&quot; said Barbara Lovelace,office-systems analyst at Ryder Systems Inc., a transportation servicescompany in Miami.andM;&quot;We were looking for a program that imported numerical tables.andP;  It'scomprehensive page-layout system with graphics and text import capabilities,&quot;she said.andM;&quot;One of the most advantageous features we've found is the fact that it runsin the Microsoft Windows environment,&quot; said Keith Fiske, another officesystems analyst at Ryder Systems.andM;In future versions, Fiske would like to see a dynamic data-exchange function&quot;linking the text in Microsoft Excel to PageMaker, and updating thespreadsheet and corresponding [PageMaker] sheet.&quot;andM;According to Karen Pattist, a computer-graphics consultant for Southern NewEngland Telephone Co. in New Haven, Conn., PageMaker offers a way to easilytransfer MS-DOS files to a Macintosh.andP;  With this ability, a user can edit anMS-DOS file and print it out using a Macintosh, she said.andM;Integrated Word ProcessorandM;PagePerfect is unique in that it offers an integrated word processor completewith a spelling checker, a thesaurus and other typical word-processingfeatures such as search and replace.andM;If users want to format their documents using PagePerfect's built-in wordprocessor, they will have no problems importing other file formats.andP;  However,those who continue using another word processor will find that PagePerfect isnot compatible with the latest versions of popular word-processor fileformats.andM;For instance, files can be imported from PagePerfect's proprietary format,WordPerfect (up to version 4.2), Microsoft Word (to 4.0), WordStarInternational's WordStar (to 4.0) and WordStar 2000, and Ashton-Tate'sMultiMate.andP;  Because PagePerfect can only handle these earlier file formats,it is inconvenient for users of WordPerfect 5.0 or Microsoft Word 5.0.andM;PagePerfect successfully imported WordPerfect 4.2 and ASCII text files.andO;XyWrite III Plus test documents must be converted to either ASCII or DCAformats before being imported into PagePerfect.andM;IMSI, of San Rafael, Calif., can be reached at (415) 454-7101.andM;Buyers say: Convenient and completeandM;&quot;There are a lot of toys out there that claim to be desktop-publishingprograms, but they're really glorified word-processing programs with a fewfeatures thrown in,&quot; said Glenn Burklund, President of Glennloc Corp., acomputer hardware manufacturer in Fairfax, Va.andP;  &quot;This is a desktop-publishingprogram that's as easy to use as word-processing program.&quot;andM;Burklund reported that PagePerfect produces documents rapidly and easily.andO;&quot;It's very easy to use, very flexible and extremely powerful,&quot; he said.andM;On the other hand, &quot;They have very poor documentation for importing [AutodeskInc.'s] AutoCAD files,&quot; he added.andM;&quot;In terms of being easy to use, there is no comparison [to other producers]&quot;said Harley Gleckman, chairman of Wall Street Financial Corp., a LosAngeles-based investment bank.andP;  &quot;Anyone in the office can be up to speed andeffectively running the program in a couple of hours.andP;  It will take a week tolearn all of its power.andM;&quot;It saves time--hours--to have the word-processing program integrated,&quot; hecontinued.andP;  &quot;We don't have to do conversions and relay the file out [to thepage-layout program]&quot;andM;However, Gleckman noted that PagePerfect lacks rulers for margin control.andO;Also, during document editing, the screen-refresh time was a disappointment.andM;&quot;When you're editing and insert a word or character, the remainder of theword or line drops down,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It's just plain awkward.&quot;andM;Peter Harris, president of Microweb Software Duplication, a softwareduplicator in San Rafael, Calif., said PagePerfect &quot;allows me to creategood-looking, typesetlike documents.andP;  Everything is all set up and ready togo.andP;  I have no reason to use a word-processing program anymore.&quot;andM;Users generally liked the ease of handling fonts.andM;&quot;All you have to do is hit a few keys and you've got the whole format forfonts, kerning, underlining, etc.,&quot; said Burklund.andP;  &quot;It's just a keystroke.andO;I just can't believe the results I've been getting.&quot;andM;Poor XyWrite III SupportandM;Those who need an easy-to-use package that provides high-quality output maywant to take a close look at PFS:First Publisher.andP;  This product importsword-processing files from Microsoft Word (up to version 4.0), WordPerfect(to 5.0), WordStar, PFS:First Choice, PFS:Write and PFS:Professional Write.andM;Overall, the file conversions worked well.andP;  Since PFS:First Publisher doesnot support XyWrite III Plus, users must first convert those files to ASCIIor DCA before importing them.andM;Importing WordPerfect 5.0 documents, however, did reveal a bug.andP;  Due to theinteraction between PFS:First Publisher's document-conversion algorithm andWordPerfect 5.0's file format, an extra blank line would appear occasionallyin the converted file.andP;  This problem can be corrected by either deleting theextra lines or by first converting the document to the WordPerfect 4.2version.andM;One outstanding feature is the product's compatibility with Bitsream Inc.andO;fonts, which lets users take advantage of Hewlett-Packard Co.'s LaserJetprinter or compatibles.andM;Sample fonts are included with the word processor, but they are provided asbit maps only.andP;  In order to create scalable fonts, users must mail anenclosed coupon to obtain the full Fontware kit.andM;Software Publishing Corp., of Mountain View, Calif., can be reached at (415)962-8910.andM;Buyers say: High quality at low costandM;&quot;I wanted something like PageMaker and Ventura without having to pay theprice,&quot; said Eliud Landin, systems administrator at Zenger-Miller Inc., asupervisory training firm in San Jose, Calif.andM;Moreover, his firm was looking for a program that did not require sendingusers to instructional classes, said Laudin.andM;Importing word-processing files was an easy process for users, according toLaudin &quot;All they have to do is take a document from WordPerfect 5.0, importit into First Publisher and add graphics,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;[Users] find it easy todo without setting up baselines and kerning.&quot;andM;Barbara Gibson, manager of human-resources information systems at Sytek Inc.,andO;a manufacturer of LAN systems in Mountain View, Calif., liked being able toincorporate graphics and Bitstream fonts easily.andM;The product is intuitive, flexible and easy to use with high-quality results,reported Gibson.andP;  However, she was disappointed that it didn't displaycolors.andM;Users were impressed with version 2.1's compatibility with Bitstream fonts.andM;&quot;They give me a lot more variety of fonts, which was one of the things FirstPublisher 2.0 didn't have,&quot; said Landin.andP;  The proprietary fonts provided inversion 2.0 were &quot;jaggy when printed out on the LaserJet,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;WithBitstream fonts, the letters are coming out a bit smoother.&quot;andM;Landin hopes a future version of First Publisher will be able to importMacintosh files.andM;Layouts on a BudgetandM;This easy-to-learn product is good for basic desktop-publishing chores.andO;Publish It! operates under Digital Research Inc.'s GEM graphical environment,as does Xerox's Ventura Publisher.andM;Although the manual pays little attention to the details of what file formatsthe product can import, the screen in the program where the user chooses theformat indicates that Publish It! can import files from WordPerfect,WordStar, Microsoft Word 4.0, GEM 1st Word Plus, Timeworks' Word Writer PCand Quintet, and straight ASCII files.andM;The product will not import WordPerfect 5.0 documents, but did well withWordPerfect 4.2 files, importing them with all formatting intact, includingboldface and underline.andP;  Users of version 5.0 will have to convert documentsto version 4.2 formats first, using the document-conversion utility includedin WordPerfect.andM;Publish It! illustrates the dividing line between low-end packages andhigh-end products such as Ventura and PageMaker.andM;Although Publish It! comes with several basic fonts, it does not support anyof the font cartridges designed for hte LaserJet printer.andM;The product supports a wide range of printers and output devices--from laserprinters to dot-matrix models--and will appeal to those putting together pagelayouts on a budget.andM;Timeworks Inc. of Deerfield, Ill.andP;  can be reached at (312) 948-9200.andM;Buyers say: Nice for the priceandM;&quot;Publish It! is economical and useful to the small-business user,&quot; said TyMaxey, a city planner for the City of Port Orange, Fla.andP;  &quot;However, thedocumentation is horrible.andP;  It's very limited and doesn't assist you ingetting from one place to the next.andP;  You have to explore on your own.andP;  Onceyou learn the program, it's a nice product for the price.&quot;andM;Maxey had difficulty importing some word-processing files into Publish It!andO;&quot;WordStar 3.3 imports easily, but we haven't been able to import WordPerfect5.0,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;When we try doing this, we come up with crazy commands whichlook like a foreign language.&quot;andM;Other users echoed this complaint.andP;  &quot;It's not easy to learn,&quot; said DaltonBell, program chairman of the Capatug Users Group in Harrisburg, Pa.andP;  &quot;I'vespent many, many hours trying to import graphics and prepare headlines fornewsletters.&quot;andM;Price was the main factor in the purchase decision for Gary Thrun, directorof sales and marketing at Anchor Products Co., a manufacturer of sutureneedles in Addison, Ill.andP;  &quot;We looked at Ventura and PageMaker but didn't wantto spend $800.andP;  We wanted something in the $200 to $250 price range,&quot; hesaid.andM;Thrun would like to import TIFF graphics files directly, but &quot;right now youhave to convert to it to PCX first,&quot; he explained.andM;&quot;It would be nice to have totally scalable fonts, which they don't havewithin this package,&quot; said Thrun.andP;  &quot;With a PostScript printer, you shouldhave the capabilities to scale.&quot;andM;Still, Thrun said, the product &quot;does what it claims to do.&quot;andM;Flexible Import OptionsandM;Ventura Publisher is a file-format polyglot, offering a wide variety of word,processing and graphic-file format import options.andM;Unlike Pagemaker, with its wide variety of import filters, Ventura Publishercan import many word-processing file formats by means of the DCA method ofdocument interchange.andP;  Users can avoid DCA if they use one of the wordprocessors that import directly to Ventura Publisher--Microsoft Word,WordPerfect versions 4.2 and 5.0, WordStar versions 3.3, 3.4, 4.0 and 5.0,Xerox Writer version 2.0 and XyWrite III Plus.andM;In addition to text that can be imported from native word-processing files,Ventura Publisher (like PageMaker) offers a rich set of text formattingcommands, or &quot;tags,&quot; that can be used in either standard ASCII text orembedded in a file created with any word processor.andP;  A user's ability to addformatting tags is one advantage of a professional-quality page-layoutprogram.andM;Documents created in WordPerfect 4.2 and 5.0, XyWrite III Plus and ASCIIformats were imported successfully.andP;  Once inside Ventura Publisher, theimported files displayed all of the formatting commands that had beenembedded in the original word-processing files.andM;Xerox Corp. can be reached in San Diego at (800) 832-6976.andM;Buyers say: Easy to Import filesandM;&quot;It's easy to import different word-processor files&quot; into Ventura Publisher,claimed David Radansky, a marketing specialist at Mutual Benefit LifeInsurance co. in Newark, N.J.andP;  Radansky uses Ventura Publisher to createpromotional brochures.andP;  &quot;Anything can go in there,&quot; he said.andM;Importing word-processing documents is straightforward with VenturaPublisher, according to David Conrad, senior business system analyst at theinsurance company Metropolitan Life Co., in New York.andM;The product is &quot;easy to use but not necessarily easy to learn,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Ithink for a lot of people it would be easier to use a word-processingprogram.&quot;andM;Some users said training is necessary in order to fully utilize the program'sfeatures.andM;&quot;It's so powerful.andP;  Without a guide, you get confused with the multitude ofchoices,&quot; said Cathy Wessels, an administrative assistant at RutgersUniversity in New Brunswick, N.J.andP;  &quot;As you get into it, you realize how verypowerful it is.andP;  I'm impressed with the ease with which it handles graphicsand text.andM;&quot;I would like the professional extension feature--which allows you to takeadvantage of expanded memory, among other things--to be included with thepackage and not sold separately,&quot; she added.andM;&quot;One thing that I don't like is that the size and scale functions aren'tintuitive,&quot; said Conrad.andP;  Users must type in the desired dimensions of animage until, by trial and error, they produce the image size they want, hesaid.andM;&quot;If you're familiar with graphic arts, the interface is not intuitive,&quot; saidEmily Stuart, a graphics specialist at the New England Journal of Medicine inWaltham, Mass.andP;  &quot;The terminology is not consistent with the standards oftypography.andP;  It's also limiting in some ways.andP;  Sometimes you can only have8,000 characters in a paragraph, a certain number of paragraphs in a chapter,128 tags in a chapter--that's limiting.&quot;andM;Vendor support was unsatisfactory, according to some users.andP;  &quot;We haveextended support service and get put on hold for a really long time,&quot; saidStuart.andP;  &quot;When we do get them, they try to offer unacceptable ways to workaround problems.&quot;andM;PC WEEK ANALYST'S NOTE ...andM;Importing by UtilityandM;In terms of the import features of page-layout software, some versions ofpopular word-processing programs are supported poorly, if at all.andP;  Somepage-layout programs do not do word processor file conversions well.andP;  Thereis a solution, however.andM;Stand-alone software utilities are available that convert nativeword-processing files into a format that desktop-publishing products canunderstand.andP;  For instance, most desktop-publishing packages can import fileswritten in IBM's Document Content Architecture (DCA) format, virtually alingua franca in the industry.andM;Software Bridge, a $149 utility from Chicago-based Systems CompatibilityCorp., speaks DCA, as well as several other file formats.andP;  It supports 23file formats, including DCA, Microsoft Word, MultiMate and WordPerfect.andO;Contact Systems Compatibility at (800) 333-1395.andM;At the high end, those who want complete control over the way aword-processor file is converted during importation may want to look atXchange, from Emulation Technologies Inc. of Cleveland.andP;  This relativelyexpensive product ($595) lets the user lay down the &quot;rules&quot; for convertingfile formats.andP;  Its file-translation programs must be written by the user,though.andP;  Contact Emulation Technologies at (800) 336-2014.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
