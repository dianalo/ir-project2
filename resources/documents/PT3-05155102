Dev. Psycopharmacol. 3, 22, 1976) and oxiracetam (see.      e.g. II Farmaco. Ed. Sc. 39/1, 16, 1984). As illustrated hereinbelow, the      compounds of the present invention are more potent than the known      compounds. </PAR><PAR>  The compounds of formula (1) are prepared via a process illustrated in the      following synthesis scheme.      ##STR3##      3-amino-.epsilon.-caprolactam is reacted in an anhydrous, inert organic      solvent, such as acetonitrile or methylene chloride or in      acetonitrile-H.sub.2 O mixture, at room temperature, for 10-24 hours, in      equimolar amount with respect to an activated carboxylic acid (Y.dbd.COX      wherein X represents an activating group) via a halogenating agent, such      as thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride, or a condensating agent, such as      dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), carbonyldiimidazole (CDl), or      2-ethoxy-1-ethoxy-carbonyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ). </PAR><PAR>  The condensation product thus obtained is purified by crystallization or by      silica gel chromatography. When R.sub.1 is other than hydrogen, the      compound of formula 1' is reacted with a halogen derivative (molar ratio      1:2) in an inert solvent, such as acetonitrile or tetrahydrofurane, in the      presence of sodium or potassium hydride (molar ratios from 1:1 to 1:2) at      room temperature or at the reflux temperature, from 2 to 24 hours, thus      giving the compound (1). </PAR><PAR>  The following non-limiting examples illustrate the preparation of some of      the compounds of formula (1). </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAC>  Preparation of (S)-3-(4-phenylbutanoylamino)-.epsilon.-caprolactam (ST 707) </PAC><PAR>  CDl (3,891 g; 24 mmoles) was added to 4-phenylbutyric acid (3.284 g; 20      mmoles) in CH.sub.2 Cl.sub.2 (100 mL) and the resulting solution was kept      under stirring for 30 minutes at room temperature.

Amnesia was brought about by administration of scopolamine      (cfr. Bammer, Pharmacological investigations of neurotransmitter      involvement in passive avoidance responding: a review and some new      results. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev., 6 (3) 247-296, 1982); or by      electroconvulsive shock (ECS) (cfr. Bammer et al., A screening method for      substances potentially active on learning and memory. J. Pharmacol.      Methods Vol.: 8 (4) 255-263, 1982). </PAR><PAR>  Male CDI mice (Charles River--Italy) weighing 25-26 g were used for the      scopolamine-induced amnesia test. </PAR><PAR>  Male CDI mice (Charles River--Germany) fed on a normal diet, were used for      the ECS-induced amnesia test. </PAR><PAR>  The compounds were administered i.p.; 0.9 mg/kg in the scopolamine-induced      amnesia test; and 9 and 0.9 mg/kg in the ECS-induced amnesia test. All      doses were equimolar to piracetam. </PAR><PAR>  The compounds were dissolved in saline. </PAR><PAR>  The apparatus for passive avoidance conditioning was a black plastic      chamber (42.times.42 cm, height 40 cm) provided with a floor constructed      of metal rods that could be electrified. From the front wall extended a      white runway, 30 cm long and 10 cm wide provided with side walls 12 cm      high, which led into the box through a guillotine door. The runway was      lightened by a 60 W lamp (cfr. Ader et al., Retention of passive avoidance      response as a function of the intensity and duration of electric shock.      Psychon. Sci., 26 (3), 125-127, 1972). </PAR><PAC>  Passive Avoidance Following Scopolamine-Induced Amnesia </PAC><PAR>  The animals were administered the compounds and scopolamine (1.5 mg/kg      s.c.) 30 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively, before the test and were      then placed on the runway. After one minute of adaptation, the door was      raised and the time employed by the animal to enter the darkened box with      all four feet, was recorded. </PAR><PAR>  Upon entry, the guillotine door was lowered and three seconds thereafter      the rods were electrified, 0.21 mA for 2 seconds. </PAR><PAR>  Immediately thereafter the animal was placed in the housing cage. Retention      was assessed 24 hours later by placing the animal on the runway and again      evaluating the latency in entering the chamber, using an end-point of 300      s (cfr. Bammer, loc. cit.). </PAR><PAR>  In each experiment, two groups of animals in addition to the treated ones      were used, that were defined as follows: </PAR><PA1>  (1) ceiling control animals (treated with placebo and not subjected to      amnesia treatment with scopolamine or ECS) to ensure that these animals      not treated with the amnesia agent remembered the task; </PA1><PA1>  (2) base-line control animals (treated with placebo and subjected to      amnesia treatment with scopolamine or ECS) to ensure that ECS or      scopolamine produced amnesia in the animals not treated with the compounds      of the present invention. </PA1><PAR>  The results of each compound under examination were expressed as percentage      of amnesia reversal (AR) in order to make comparisons across the tested      compounds. </PAR><PAR>  AR is defined as follows:      ##EQU1##      wherein CI, comparison index (the subscripts &quot;t&quot; and &quot;c&quot; refer to      &quot;treated&quot; and &quot;ceiling control&quot;, respectively) is defined by the formula </PAR><EQU>  CIandequals;andlsqb;.SIGMA.Aij/Ni.Nj)andrsqb; 100 </EQU><PAL>  wherein </PAL><PA1>  Ni is the number of animals belonging to the i-nth group (ceiling control      or treated animals); </PA1><PA1>  Nj is the number of animals belonging to the j-nth group (base-line control      animals), and </PA1><PA1>  Aij is a binary function that can take only the values andplus;1, 0 or -1      depending on whether the latency time (in seconds) of an animal belonging      to the i-nth group, Xi, is higher than, the same as or smaller than the      latency time (in seconds) of an animal of the j-nth group, Xj. </PA1><PAL>  The sum .SIGMA.Aij encompasses all the possible paira obtained by combining      each term Xi with each term Xj. </PAL><PAR>  Whenever in performing the test the comparison index (CI) between ceiling      control animals and base-line control animals, generally expected to range      between 60 and 80%, turned out to be lower than 40%, the data for the      whole experiment were discarded. </PAR><PAR>  The results are shown in Table 1. In particular, at the dose of 0.9 mg/kg,      the amnesia reversal of ST 796 and ST 800 was 65% and 64%, respectively.      ST 734 and ST 893 showed to be inactive.
