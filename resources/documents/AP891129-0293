A modification to a four-month-old temporary restraining ordercalls for the 13 defendants to appear Dec. 12 in U.S. BankruptcyCourt in New York for a hearing on Sunday's disturbance in Atlanta.   Seven strikers were arrested on charges of unlawful assemblywhen they refused to leave Hartsfield Atlanta International Airportafter a group of pickets pelted cars with rocks and injured aworking Eastern employee.   On Monday, Atlanta Aviation Commisioner Calvin O. Carter orderedthe strikers to dismantle a tent city erected on airport groundsshortly after the Machinists went on strike March 4. The strikershave established a new compound near the airport.   The show-cause order issued by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.Lifland cites ``willful defiance'' of a July 17 temporaryrestraining order prohibiting the Atlanta pickets from threateningor injuring Eastern workers.   Lifland is overseeing the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganizationof the Miami-based airline, which filed for protection five daysafter the strike began.   Machinist union leaders, meanwhile, huddled in Washington toassess the impact the defections of pilots and flight attendantswould have on their strike and pledged to continue their walkout``however long it takes.''   Machinists union President George Kourpias said the union wouldtry to pressure Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent, and thebankruptcy court overseeing the cash-strapped carrier into asettlement.   The plans include demanding that Lifland remove himself from thecase. Kourpias and other Machinists leaders have accused Lifland ofbias in favor of Texas Air.   The Machinists cited in the order could face fines and courtcosts if found in contempt, said Eastern spokesman Robin Matell.They include Charles Bryan, head of the Eastern Machinists, andRobert Taylor and Charles Pecca, Machinist officials based inAtlanta.   Lifland's order also requires that a special union telephonemessage in Atlanta carry a statement from Local 1690 GeneralChairman Bob Taylor condemning the Sunday incident and saying theunion ``does not condone these acts or are they part of the ...strike strategy.''   Anthony Chapman, vice president of the Atlanta Machinists'local, said Wednesday he had not received the filing and declinedto comment.   Defendants are expected to receive the order no later thanFriday.   Matell noted that the temporary restraining order and theshow-cause order only affect Atlanta.   In Miami, meanwhile, talks opened Wednesday between Eastern andits flight attendants union, which joined pilots last week inending an 8{-month-old sympathy strike.   Matell said the two-hour meeting produced no agreements, and theflight attendants are scheduled to make a contract proposal Monday.   Sandra Mickley, a spokeswoman for the Transport Workers Union,declined to give details of the contract offer. The TWU representsflight attendants at Eastern.   She said topics raised at Wednesday's meeting included thecompany policy for rehiring workers and the union's suit againstthe airline seeking back union dues.   Eastern currently has about 3,400 flight attendants. The unionrepresented about 6,000 workers at the beginning of the strike, butit is unknown how many remain, said Ms. Mickley.   National Mediation Board representative Sam Cognata held thefirst negotiating session Tuesday between the Air Lines PilotsAssociation and Eastern management, which began rebuilding withoutits unions following the walkout.   The airline has asked U.S. District Court in Miami to clarifythe rights of employees and those of strikers who wish to return towork. Matell said no hearing date had been set on that request.</TEXT></DOC>
