(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush said today drugsare ``the ultimate fatal attraction'' and he renewed his call oncompanies to institute anti-drug programs in order to receivefederal contracts.   ``The point is that stopping drugs in the workplace is not justa profit and loss issue, it's a matter of protecting the health andsafety of workers. It's no less important than OSHA regulations onthe conditions of machinery,'' the certain Republican presidentialnominee told the U.S. Jaycees annual meeting.   ``The federal government should not dictate what kind ofdrug-free program a company should have, but it should require anyfederal contractor to have one in place,'' he said.   As in the past, Bush left open the question of whether theseprograms must include some form of mandatory drug testing.   In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Bushsuggested that many Americans still don't know ``who I am'' despite7{ years as vice president. He said he would rely heavily onadvertising and surrogate speakers to help get his message out.   Bush also said he may select a woman as a running mate.   And he blamed some of his high negatives in recent publicopinion polls on Democrats ``shooting at you every day'' during thejust-ended primary season.   ``I think we have time to be sure that a positive image is outon who I am and what I feel and where I'll take the country. AndI'll readily concede that some of that's not clear yet,'' he said.   ``I think the answer on the polls, if there are negatives there,is to turn them into positives,'' Bush said.   On the subject of a running mate, Bush said that thevote-drawing ability of an individual to help him in the polls``would be a factor _ man or woman'' in the selection. However, hesays his primary consideration remains a capability to take over inthe event something happened to the president.   ``Look, the gender question was crossed when Geraldine Ferrarowent on the (1984 Democratic) ticket,'' he said. ``And that was agood thing, a very good thing.''   Among those women mentioned prominently in speculation about thespot are former Transporation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Sen. NancyKassebaum, R-Kan., Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor andNebraska Gov. Kay Orr.   ``Literally, I haven't started thinking about names'' ofpotential running mates, although ``it's thoroughly understandablethere's increased speculation,'' Bush said.   The vice president declined to say whether he thought recentpolls, showing him trailing Democrat Michael Dukakis, were partly areflection of President Reagan's lagging popularity. ``I don't wantto lay off any problems I may have on somebody else,'' he said.   Bush said he hoped to narrow the gap _ especially the ``gendergap'' indicating he has far less support among women than among men.   ``People are interested in the family. I've got a good one,''Bush said. ``I don't think we get credit for how we manage familyvalues yet, and what really motivates me. And caring, andcompassion and all that stuff.''   He said that Dukakis ``will come out of that Democraticconvention with a traditional liberal Democratic platform. We'llcome out with a sound, forward-looking Republican platform. Thatwill put the differences in focus.''   In a wide-ranging interview on Wednesday, Bush also:   _Indicated he would pursue the Reagan administration's fight forcontinued military aid for anti-government Contra forces inNicaragua if elected, but with more of an effort to reach anaccommodation with Congress. ``I'd want to do it practically tosee, let's be sure what we do will pass,'' he said.   The adminstration has repeatedly run into broad opposition inCongress for its efforts to provide military assistance to theContras. ``I'd love to find a way to take a package to the Hill andget it passed,'' Bush said.   _Said, if elected, he would ``redouble whatever efforts wehave'' to press for the release of jailed South African blackleader Nelson Mandela and to get the Pretoria governent tonegotiate with opposition factions.   However, he said he opposes the depiction by Democratic platformwriters of that white minority-ruled country as a ``terroriststate'' and said he opposes Dukakis' call for tougher economicsanctions. The ones now in place, he said, ``aren't working and arehurting the people we're trying to help.''   _Conceded that his efforts to paint Dukakis as an elitist``Harvard liberal'' could backfire, saying: ``I wouldn't want to dotoo much of that.'' However, he said he plans to mix campaignrhetoric against Dukakis with facts and said: ``I've got to getpeople's attention.''   Bush was to address a national convention of the Junior Chambersof Commerce today in Richmond.   On Wednesday, he went to the Capitol to endorse a HouseRepublican plan to severely punish narcotics users _ including aproposal for the death penalty for major drug dealers, which he hadpreviously supported _ and used the opportunity to accuse Democratsof making a ``shrill political issue'' of anti-drug programs.   He also joined former rival Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole atthe Agriculture Department for a briefing from AgricultureSecretary Richard E. Lyng on this year's drought throughout much ofthe nation.</TEXT></DOC>
