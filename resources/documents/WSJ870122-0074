The contract stems from the recovery plan mapped out by the Air Force last year after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger and the failure of an Air Force Delta rocket. The new rockets, called Delta IIs, will be used mainly to lift Navstar satellites into space. The U.S. relies on these to provide global military information to U.S. ships, aircraft and command and control centers.    McDonnell Douglas won the contract after a competition with three other bidders -- Martin Marietta Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and Hughes Aircraft Co. The Air Force also took an option to procure another 13 of the rockets. If exercised, these options would bring the total value of the contract to $669.3 million.    A McDonnell Douglas spokesman said the contract calls for the company to build and launch the seven vehicles over a three-year period. He added that the company plans to offer the Delta IIs to commercial customers as well.    In other contracts awarded yesterday, Aerojet Strategic Propulsion Co., a unit of Gencorp Inc., received a $77 million Air Force contract for MX missile propulsion equipment.    Rolls-Royce Ltd. won a $55 million Navy contract for F-402 aircraft engines.    Hughes Aircraft Co., a General Motors Corp. unit, received a $48.1 million Navy contract for electronic equipment for A-6 aircraft.    Quality Apparel Manufacturing Corp. received a $24.2 million Defense Logistics Agency contract for camouflage trousers.    Boeing Co. got a $24 million Navy contract to produce E-6A aircraft. </TEXT></DOC>
