ClarkCounty is designated nonattainment for the pollutant ozone under section107 of the Act (40 CFR 81.336). \1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Because of the proximity of Clark County to Dayton, ClarkCounty emissions and emission reductions were included as an integral partof the greater Dayton ozone demonstration area SIP. USEPA approved Ohio'sattainment demonstration for the greater Dayton area, including Clark County,on October 31, 1980 (45 FR 72122), because the State's plan for the areaas a whole demonstrated the attainment and maintenance of the ozone standardthere by December 31, 1982. Violations of the ozone standard were recordedin the Dayton area subsequent to 1982. The two Navistar plants contain surface coating lines that are used topaint truck cabs, hoods, chassis, and miscellaneous parts. Under the existingfederally approved SIP, each miscellaneous metal parts and products surfacecoating line is subject to the control requirements contained in Ohio AdministrativeCode (OAC) Rule 3745-21-09(U). OAC Rule 3745-21-09(U)(1)(a)(iii) limitsthe VOC content of an extreme performance coating to 3.5 pounds of VOCper gallon (lbs of VOC/gal) of coating, excluding water. OAC Rule 3745-21-04(C)(28)requires compliance with this limit by December 31, 1982. USEPA approvedthese rules and others as meeting the Reasonably Available Control Technology(RACT) \2\<NOTE/> requirements of Part D and the Act on June 29, 1982 (47 FR28097). Nine lines at the Assembly plant (P001-P004, P007-P009, R004 andR005) and one line at the Body plant (K001) are currently being operatedin violation of OAC Rule 3745-21-09(U) for surface coating of miscellaneousmetal parts and products. In lieu of the requirements mentioned above,OEPA has submitted for Navistar as a revision to the Ohio SIP (1) a compliancedate extension until December 31, 1987, and (2) for seven of the lines,a relaxation from the RACT based limits to the VOC content of coatingscurrently in use on these lines. The coatings currently used are acrylicenamel, urethane, and chassis coating with VOC contents of 4.86, 4.66,and 3.66 lbs of VOC per gallon of coating, excluding water, respectively.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ RACT is defined as the lowest emission limit that a sourceis capable meeting by the application of control technology that is reasonablyavailable considering technological and economic feasibility. In orderfor a relaxation from an existing SIP limit to be approved as site-specificRACT, the State must demonstrate that it is technically or economicallyinfeasible to meet a limit lower than that proposed as RACT. <ITAG tagnum="84">Compliance Data Extension </ITAG>OEPA has requested a compliance date extension to December 31, 1987, forlines K001, P001, and P002. By that date, the lines will be shut down andreplaced with new coating lines which will be in compliance with OAC Rule3745-21-09(U). In order for a compliance date extension to be approvable,the request must comply with EPA criteria. The extension for Navistar'ssurface coating lines does not satisfy one of these criteria because Ohiodid not adequately research the compliance status of other similar sourcesto determine if compliance by the original deadline was reasonable. Asexplained below, Illinois has documentation that complying coatings areavailable (and in use) for the heavy duty off highway vehicle manufacturingindustry. In addition, EPA policy requires the State to demonstrate thatthe extension will not interfere with the timely attainment and maintenanceof the ozone standard and, where relevant ``reasonable further progress''(RFP) towards timely attainment. This would generally be done by comparingthe margin for attainment predicted by the approval ozone attainment demonstrationand the increased emissions that would result under the proposed extension.However, if the State or USEPA believes that there has been a substantialchange in the inventory since the ozone SIP was approved so that the marginof attainment has changed significantly, a revised demonstration in supportof the revision request is required. Such a demonstration would be necessaryin areas which purported to demonstrate attainment by 1982, but for whichpost-1982 monitoring data are indicating exceedances of the ozone standard.Because Navistar is located in such an area, a revised demonstration ofattainment for the Dayton area would be required before the compliancedate extension can be approved. <ITAG tagnum="84">Relaxation of the Emissions Limit </ITAG>OEPA has also requested a relaxation from emission limits contained inOAC Rule 3745-21-09(U) for the remaining seven coating lines at its Assemblyplant. OEPA believes that this relaxation is necessary because Navistarclaims that it has been unable to reformulate its coatings to a compliancelevel and that add-on control is not economically feasible. OEPA is proposingto limit the VOC content of coatings used on these lines to that of thecoatings currently in use. The total annual VOC emissions from the coatinglines in 1984 were 765.5 tons, while the allowable emissions were 460.7tons. Part D of the Act requires RACT-level controls in all areas which havenot attained a NAAQS. USEPA approved OAC Rule 3745-21-9(U) as meeting theRACT requirements on June 29, 1982. A relaxation from these limits canonly be approved if the State can meet two tests: first, it must demonstratethat it is technically or economically infeasible for the source to meetthe limit. Second, it must demonstrate the new limits are RACT for thatparticular source. In the case of the proposed Navistar SIP relaxation,this means that the State must document both that complying coatings arenot available and that add-on controls are not feasible in order to meetthe first test. To document this first test, OEPA initially provided correspondence withonly four coating suppliers regarding the availability of low solvent coatings.Most of this correspondence is dated October 1983, and states that complyingtopcoats are not available but that research is continuing. On April 16,1986, OEPA submitted additional information concerning Navistar's effortsto develop complying coatings. This documentation indicates that althoughNavistar has been able to reformulate some coatings, there are still manyfor which reformulation has been unsuccessful. However, as discussed ina January 1986, ``Study of Low-VOC Coatings Available for Use in the IllinoisHeavy-Duty Off-Highway Vehicle Manufacturing Industry'', complying coatingsare avilable and in use at similar coating facilities. According to thisstudy, there are at least six coating companies supplying complying coatings(3.5 lb/gal) and at least six manufacturing facilities currently usingsuch coatings. OEPA has provided no explanation of why Navistar would beunable to use these coatings. Therefore, it has not been demonstrated thatit is infeasible for Navistar to meet the existing SIP limit using reformulatedcoatings. OEPA's November 17, 1986, submittal contains cost estimates for add-oncontrol. The cost estimates in this report have not been adequately explainedand documented. In particular, OEPA has not provided the following:1. Documentation of capital costs (e.g., vendor quotes). 2. Explanation of assumptions used in calculating operating costs.3. Possible reasons for the high cost of VOC control for this source comparedto the range of estimates contained in the CTG for miscellaneous metalproducts.In addition, the study submitted does not appear to consider possible alternativecontrol methods. For example, it may be less expensive to control ovenexhaust than spray booth exhaust.<ITAG tagnum="84">Status of Ozone Attainment Demonstration_Clark County</ITAG>Navistar's Body and Assembly plants are located in Clark County, whichis designated nonattainment of the ozone NAAQS, and which is a part ofthe greater Dayton nonattainment area for ozone. Navistar provided an airquality demonstration for the proposed revision which was based on the1979 USEPA approved ozone SIP for the Dayton area. (See footnote 1.) Inorder to get approval of a source-specific SIP revision, a State must demonstratethat the revision will not interfere with expeditious attainment and maintenanceof the ozone standard and reasonable further progress toward attainment.Dayton's 1979 ozone SIP was approved for attainment of the ozone standardby the end of 1982 and maintenance thereafter. However, because violationshave been measured in 1983 and 1984, and there have been more recent exceedancesof the ozone standard (as late as 1987), USEPA cannot determine whetherthe SIP is maintaining the ozone standard. Ohio cannot, therefore, relyon the 1979 demonstration of attainment to show that the revision willnot interfere with continued maintenance of the ozone standard. While USEPAhas not chosen to call for a SIP revision because of a substantially inadequateplan for this area, any relaxations, such as the one addressed in thisnotice, must be accompanied by a persuasive demonstration that the areawill continue to maintain the ozone standard for the foreseeable futuredespite the relaxation. Since the State has not made this demonstration,USEPA cannot approve this relaxation.USEPA is proposing to disapprove this variance as a SIP revision because(1) the State has not shown that the granting of the variance will notinterfere with expeditious attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the area; (2)the State did not demonstrate the Navistar's compliance plan is expeditious;and (3) the State has not demonstrated that the current emission limitsfor Navistar are technically or economically infeasible and that the proposedlimits are RACT for that particular source.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subject in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbon, Intergovermental relations, Ozone.USEPA is providing a 30-day comment period on this notice of proposed rulemaking.Public comments received on or before August 8, 1988 will be consideredin USEPA's final rulemaking. All comments will be available for inspectionduring normal business hours at the Region V office listed at the frontof this notice.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP disapproval will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,because the effect of this disapproval is to leave in effect existing emissionlimitations. Therefore, there is no change or any impact on any sourceor community. Under Executive Order 12291, this action is not ``Major''. It has beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 29, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Valdas V.
