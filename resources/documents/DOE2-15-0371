Two methods, dual-photon absorptiometry (DPA)and quantitative computed tomography, have widespread application inadults but only limited use in children. One method, single-photon absorptiometry(SPA), has been used extensively in adults and children and has beenmodified for use in infants. The radius shaft has been used for mostresearch on infants. However, the difficulty of using older SPA methodson this small bone (4 to 7 mm width) has led a few investigators to measurethe shaft of the humerus. The typical precision of measurement in a newbornis about 5% with the use of computerized rectilinear scanners for theradius; older linear scanners have a precision error of 5% to 10% onthe humerus. Linear scanners cannot measure precisely the radius in individualneonates. The SPA scans typically take about 5 minutes. The DPA techniqueusing {sup 153}Gd has been modified for use on smaller animals (5 to10 kg monkeys and dogs), but it has not been used on infants becauseDPA scans take 20 minutes. New methods using x-ray absorptiometry allowrapid (1 minute), precise (1%) measurements in the perinate. The needfor a soft tissue bolus is eliminated, and both the axial and peripheralskeletons can be measured with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Ultrasonicmeasurements do not yet offer adequate precision in the neonate, giventhe limited biologic range of values. 83 references.</TEXT></DOC>
