Lucrezia Gentile, 36, was charged with murder in the death ofher son, Stephen, said police spokesman Sgt. Maurice Howard. Shewas awaiting arraignment Thursday night.   The infant's body was discovered not far from the family homeafter a day of questioning in which the mother was given apolygraph test and told detectives where to find the baby, saidChief of Detectives Robert Colangelo.   ``We believe that Lucrezia Gentile drowned her 2-month-old sonStephen in the bathtub of their residence at approximately 9:30a.m. yesterday,'' Colangelo said.   Mrs. Gentile then ``dressed the baby, placed him in a whiteplastic bag, put him in his stroller, walked several blocks ... andplaced the baby in a green trash can,'' he said.   Mrs. Gentile, whose husband, John Gentile, 32, is a part-timeemployee of the U.S. Marshal's office, had told police the baby wastaken from his stroller Wednesday by two men in a sedan who hadstopped her to ask directions.   She said the abduction occurred as she was on her way to thegrammar school attended by her 7-year-old son. About an hourearlier, Mrs. Gentile had said, a woman had called to say the sonwas ill at the school.   Sgt. Peter Sweeney, a police spokesman, had said shortly beforethe baby was found that no ranson demand had been made and policehad no leads on who took the baby or why.   A $5,000 reward was posted earlier Thursday by Thomas McDonald,a retired firefighter and longtime resident of the Gentiles'neighborhood.   ``I want the return of the baby, that's the important thing,''McDonald had said. ``I just hope they don't compound kidnappingwith murder.''   ``I feel violated and so do my neighbors,'' said McDonald. ``Youshould see the parents today, holding onto their children,hollering at their children. The parents are scared.''   Gentile has worked as a guard for the U.S. marshal's office forabout a year, said Chief Deputy Marshal Mike Pizzi. Gentile hadretired with a disability from the Conrail police force in 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
