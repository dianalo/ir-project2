(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 20 medium-security inmates agreedearly Mondayto peacefully end their 3-day-old prison uprising afterauthorities said the surrender could be televised, according toofficials.   Late Sunday, the inmates released one of three guards they wereholding hostage, authorities said.   The inmates, whose rebellion at the Mack Alford CorrectionalCenter began late Friday and resulted in $2.5 million in damages,agreed to surrender at 8:30 a.m. CDT Monday if the surrender istelevised, Warden Ted Wallman said through a spokesman.   Prison officials agreed to that demand and a demand that statelegislators observe the surrender, said the spokesman, Jerry Massie.   The guard was released in exchange for food and a meeting withthree state legislators, officials said.   ``We gave, them some pop, ice cream, and cigarettes and theytalked to some legislators,'' Corrections Department spokeswomanJoy Hadwiger said.   The inmates, who hung bedsheet banners that called for ``WhitePower'' and accused corrections officials of lying as the siegestretched into a third day, released prison Capt. Lewis McGee, shesaid.   He was in apparently good health, she added, and the otherhostages were also thought to be unharmed.   Anita Trammell, another spokeswoman for the prison, said earlierthat no resolution was in sight with the inmates, believed armedwith crude knives.   The prison administration for the first time Sunday nightreleased a list of the captors' demands.   Ms. Trammell said that besides the ice cream and cigarettes, thedemands included having the electricity turned back on in theirarea, and having meetings with reporters and with Lou Bullock, anAmerican Civil Liberties attorney who has helped prisoners in thepast.   The inmates also asked for the return of a bus that was madeavailable to take the inmates to a federal prison late Saturday asthey requested, but left empty when negotiations broke down.   Late in the afternoon, two inmates took one of the guardsoutside for less than 10 minutes and talked briefly to correctionalofficers through a fence in a remote corner of the prison.   A prison spokesman said the guard appeared to be all right, asdid the two other guards when they were spotted earlier in the day.   Ms. Trammell said the guard, identified as Sgt. Harold Yoder,was used a shield by the inmates who worked to close a hole in thefence cut by prison officials to help other inmates surrender.   She said the hostage takers have told the roughly 30 otherinmates locked in the ocupied south dorm that their lives would bein danger if they try to leave. She said, however, that thoseinmates said they don't feel like hostages.   The spokeswoman also said other inmates who have been moved outof damaged parts of the prison said the hostage takers are``ridiculous and crazy.''   Inmates also hung sheets with messages written on them from theroof of the two-story dormitory where the hostages were held.   The first sheet said ``White Power,'' while a second sheet hunglater referred to the state Department of Corrections and said:``DOC Will Not Respond to Demands. They Have Lied to You the Publicand Press.''   Commenting on the first banner, Ms. Trammell said, ``I feel likethe inmates did that for attention. Also, I feel like we have someracists up there.''   Of the three hostage guards, one is white, one is black and oneis an American Indian.   There have been unconfirmed reports that a racial incident setoff the violence at the 33-year-old prison late Friday.   Later, a third sheet was hung requesting help from the press,but small letters and shade made it impossible to read the wholemessage.   According to authorities, the uprising began when officers triedto move five inmates to a maximum-security prison. The five hadreportedly threatened other inmates who allegedly had stolen fromthem.   The inmates then seized eight hostages; five hostages werereleased unharmed Saturday. One guard and one inmate were injuredin the violence, which also caused about $2.5 million in damage.   It had been reported from the start that 10 inmates wereactively involved in holding the guards. However, Ms. Trammellquoted the warden as saying the number was closer to 20.   Most of the prisoners who were routed from their dorms weretransferred to other prisons. Corrections Department spokeswomanJoy Hadwiger in Oklahoma City said 150 were being held in agymnasium area of the prison awaiting relocation, with 51 in thesouth dorm where the hostages were being held.   Carolyn Yoder, wife of one of the hostages, said earlier thatauthorities should use a special weapons and tactics team to endthe standoff.   ``Those boys are smart enough to know what they're doing,'' shesaid. ``I'd feel a lot safer with them going in there to take myhusband.''   The prison, opened in 1955, is located in southeastern Oklahomaabout 130 miles from Oklahoma City. It has the sixth-largest prisonpopulation in Oklahoma with 652 inmates but has an operationalcapacity of just 492, corrections officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
