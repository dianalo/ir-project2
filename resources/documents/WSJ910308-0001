And U.K. shares bottomed out at the close of moderatetrading, as investors took profits following Wednesday'srecord climbs.</LP><TEXT>   In Tokyo, support faltered on Japanese bond marketweakness in the afternoon and on worries about the Marchstock-futures expiration, traders said. But index-buying byGoldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers at the close inpreparation for Friday morning's special quotation broughtthe index back nearly 100 points within the last fiveminutes, traders said.   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 14.97 points to26397.96. The index surged 469.51 points Wednesday.   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei rose 61.57 points to close themorning session at 26459.53.   Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at550 million shares, off from 676.9 million shares Wednesday.Decliners outnumbered gainers 519 to 481, reflecting thebroader market's softness. There were 144 unchanged issues.   The composite Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues in thefirst section fell 2.60 points to 1955.61.   The second section index added 7.89 points to 3089.90.Volume in the section was estimated at 12.7 million shares,down from 15.8 million shares.   Traders said the arbitrage buying at the close came to10,000 shares by Goldman Sachs and 15,000 shares by SalomonBrothers on each of the 225 issues, while Morgan Stanley wasseen selling about 3,000 shares of the Nikkei.   Buying was mostly scattered Thursday morning, althoughlarger-capital issues were receiving support. Auto shares,large-capital electricals and shipbuilders were among popularissues.   But as the dollar began to reach the high end of its rangeagainst the yen in the afternoon, Japanese government bonddealers began adjusting positions. As yields were senthigher, sentiment in the stock market soured, traders said.The yield on the benchmark, the No. 129, 6.4% due 2000 endedTokyo Stock Exchange trade at 6.645%, up four basis points onthe day and the high yield of exchange trade. A basis pointis 1/100th of a percentage point.   Selling on the stock market picked up as bearish sentimentbegan to spread to concern about the futures expiration, aJapanese dealer said. Once participants decided not to buy,they figured they may as well try to take profits, he said.   Fiscal book closings for domestic institutions will peaknext week and the week after, so many investors are stilltrying to lock in profits.   Sumitomo Metal topped the day's most active list, gaining8 yen to 530 yen ($3.90).   Minebea, which soared 120 yen in heavy volume fromspeculative buying Wednesday, fell 30 yen to 1110 yen.   Nippondenso Co. gained 20 yen to 1790, after the producerof electronic and electrical parts for automobiles said thefiscal year's consolidated pretax earnings gained 16% to131.87 billion yen.   Itoman Corp. gained 10 yen to 680 yen. Ho Yong Jun, abusinessman who had held 18.64% of the company, sold a largechunk of his holdings in a move that appears aimed atrepaying debt to the Japanese trading house. He had faced anend of March deadline for the repayment.   In London, traders said U.K. interest rate cuts didn'tmaterialize, and, although investors still expect a cut totake place ahead of the March 19 budget, the investorsreckoned it was a good day to take profits.   In addition, the disclosure of several company earnings,showing poor 1990 results, removed some of Wednesday'seuphoria.   Traders said Thursday's drift lower might at least havegiven market makers the opportunity to pick up stock. Theymarked prices lower Wednesday, expecting to produce someselling by fund managers but only managed to generate morebuying interest by institutions.   Equity futures and Wall Street failed to provide muchdirection, and the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 ShareIndex drifted off to close 22.2 points lower, at 2437.7. TheFinancial Times 30 Share Index was down 26.9 points at1950.7. Volume was 665.8 million shares compared withWednesday's 1.05 billion shares.

Ladbroke fell 13 1/2 pence to 263 1/2 pence after saying1990 pretax profit edged 1% higher to #306 million, at thelower end of market forecasts. Analysts predict the leisuregroup will suffer poor results from property operations in1991.   WPP, a marketing services group, firmed 11 pence to 135pence after recording 1990 pretax profit up 20% to #95million, at the top end of market expectations. WPP alsoreached a financial package with its banks.   Oil concern Ultramar, dropped 11 pence to 340 pence afterreporting that 1990 net income rose 17% to #119 million. Butanalysts were disappointed with downstream earnings andpredict a downturn in 1991 profit as lower oil prices hitupstream operations and reverse inventory gains into losses.   However, other oil stocks rose ahead of the OPEC meetingin anticipation of an agreement limiting production.Enterprise gained 12 pence to 597 pence and Lasmo rose 4pence to 380 pence. British Petroleum was flat at 335 pence,but Shell advanced 5 pence to 480 pence.   Among the handful of other stocks to gain, Guinness was up11 pence at 826 pence.

In Frankfurt, energy and chemicals group Veba AG said 1990net profit declined 12%, sharper than expected, sending thestock market broadly lower at the close. Veba fell 8.70 marksto 335 marks ($5.65 to $218).   In Zurich, Omni Holding tumbled 80 Swiss francs to 260francs ($59.68 to $194). However, Adia, in which Omni has a53% voting stake, was unchanged at 900 francs.
