(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Cuban family's exile has ended withshouts of joy as they returned to this country five months aftercrossing into Canada for what was supposed to be a brief look atNiagara Falls.   ``Feliz! Feliz!'' Bermaida Fajardo yelled in Spanish as she ranfrom a car to hug a friend.   Even though the family lived in Miami for several years andowned a home and business there, U.S. officials blocked theirreturn from a Christmastime sightseeing trip to Ontario becausethey lacked proof of citizenship.   ``I made a mistake,'' Mrs. Fajardo's husband, Carlos, saidTuesday after crossing the Peace Bridge into Buffalo. ``We shouldnot have left the country. I know that now.''   At the time, Fajardo had an application for political asylumpending, but it was nullified when the Fajardos and their twochildren crossed the border.   Fajardo, his wife and her two children, Yoradlys and Yoandys,had traveled north during the Christmas holidays to see snow. Theysaid they crossed into Canada to get a better view of Niagara Falls.   Much of the family's stay in Canada was spent trying to get anew application prepared.   Their plight attracted the attention of Miami's Hispaniccommunity and Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., appealed to immigrationofficials to allow them to return on humanitarian grounds.   But Benedict Ferro, district director of the U.S. Immigrationand Naturalization Service in Buffalo, denied the request forhumanitarian parole in March, citing the family's record ofimmigration fraud.   Ferro said Mrs. Fajardo used phony documents to enter thecountry illegally in 1985 and that an immigration judge ruled lastsummer that she and her two children by another marriage should bedeported.   But after a new application for asylum and subsequent INSinvestigation, Ferro said he could overlook the history of fraudbecause Fajardo had a legitimate fear of political persecution ifreturned to Cuba.   ``The system worked the way it is supposed to,'' Ferro said.``They were denied (parole) on merit, but they were able to meetthe test for asylum. Those are two different standards.''   Sister Kathleen Rimar, who acted as the Fajardo's attorney,criticized immigration officials.   ``They could have been allowed to return much sooner but I thinkthey felt they had to make an example of them,'' she said.   She said that during the exile in Canada the Fajardos lost theirhome and business in Miami.   Despite the losses, Fajardo said he felt no animosity towardimmigration officials.   ``I don't think about that. I'm only interested in the future,''Fajardo said. ``I feel like I have been born again.''   The family plans to spend a few days in Buffalo and then returnto the Miami area where friends and relatives will help themre-establish a boat building business.   Immigration officials said the family would be able to apply forcitizenship next year.</TEXT></DOC>
