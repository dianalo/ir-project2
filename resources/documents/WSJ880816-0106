American Hoist andamp; Derrick needs machinists and Opto Mechanik, Melbourne, Fla., can't find glass grinders for military tank sights. Chevron says 70% of applicants for word-processing work flunk skills tests; 65% fail Douglas Aircraft typing tests. &quot;A basic skills gap . . . is widening,&quot; the Labor, Education and Commerce departments warn.    Many employers turn to temporaries, or start training schools. Denny's, a California restaurant firm, needs workers with accounting know-how; it is creating a development program. Miami banks begin basic math classes next month for Dade County public schools, to educate future tellers.    A high school diploma no longer means the grad &quot;can read and write or add and subtract,&quot; an AmeriFirst Bank official says.    A &quot;CHARON RESPONSE&quot; is needed when failing plants close.    So say Baylor University researchers Daniel Jennings and Van Miller, whose study shows that when a business facility shuts down, workers often go through deathlike stages -- denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. They urge, as a role model, the mythical boatman Charon, who transported Greek souls across the River Styx. To avoid &quot;turf battles,&quot; they urge that a community task force &quot;carry&quot; displaced workers to new jobs.    When a General Tire plant at Waco, Texas, closed, the mayor formed a task force, and a state official headed the group's rescue effort, the authors say. Job-seeking assistance and other benefits helped avert reactions such as suicides, abuse of one's family, illnesses and angry reactions toward the employer.    CORPORATE &quot;CULTURES&quot; must change to meet business goals, firms say.    In a survey of 2,196 companies by consultant Hay Group, 75% said it's important to redo their culture -- the corporate strategy or atmosphere. But only 46% were working on a program for change, such as encouraging internal competition to meet market demands. Elias Zinn, new president of electronics retailer Crazy Eddie Inc., strives to focus the firm's culture on profit concerns, instead of &quot;sell! sell! sell!&quot;    Xerox emphasizes product quality and customer satisfaction. Nucor Corp. goes for teamwork. Eastman Kodak moves from slow-growth photography toward quick diversification. Southwest Airlines, CompuTrac and Chili's Inc. emphasize workplace &quot;fun,&quot; to spur new ideas and help customers enjoy the companies' services.    CompuTrac founder &quot;Sonny&quot; Margolis provides synthesizers and space for jam sessions by the firm's band, the CompuTones.    A ONE-ARMED ROBOT to handle and bag hospital silverware is developed by a Carnegie Mellon University researcher. The robot will boost kitchen productivity and aid sanitary conditions; usually, up to five people handle patients' silverware, increasing the risk of spreading disease, the robot's developer says.    SMOKESTACK INDUSTRIES face a dearth of chief executives, at least from the ranks, warns Battalia andamp; Associates, a search firm. Its study of 50 manufacturing firms shows that 75% of group or division presidents or general managers, the source of most CEOs, are already 50 to 60 years old, with &quot;slim&quot; chances to head the firm.    PROTECTION BEGINS at home, 567 Environmental Protection Agency employees say, petitioning the EPA to provide healthier air in agency buildings. Better ventilation and removal of new carpeting that they say made many workers sick head their list. The EPA says it will study the &quot;sick building syndrome&quot; problems.    CHALLENGING WORK leads the list of motivating factors for doing one's job, in a survey of members by the American Productivity and Quality Center, a business research and education group. Having one's opinion matter, recognition for a job well done and pay clearly tied to performance ranked next, in that order.    DUELING STUDIES clash over the impact of a minimum-wage rise.    The wage bill's opponents cite views by 100 largely conservative economists that the boost will slash job prospects for the poor; but 52 mainly liberal economists predict only a small effect. Two University of Chicago analysts foresee job cuts in 160 selected congressional districts -- up to 4,944 by 1991, for example, in one Texas district. But the Congressional Budget Office sees &quot;moderate&quot; losses of 175,000 to 350,000 jobs.    The CBO says all such forecasts are prone to error. And a public-interest group cites a University of Michigan study estimating job losses of only 70,000. It says other studies are based on the 1960s and 1970s, when the impact of an increase was greater because more workers were at or near the wage floor, and the teen-age labor market wasn't tight.    Nonsense, opponents reply; they say two large food firms alone predict the boost would force them to trim jobs by about 40,000.    THE CHECKOFF: September is the second-busiest corporate hiring month, next to January, partly because less-busy employers in August spend more time with fewer job seekers, says Challenger, Gray andamp; Christmas, placement firm. . . . The Mine Safety and Health Administration will hold a national metal and nonmetal mine rescue contest in Las Vegas next week. </TEXT></DOC>
