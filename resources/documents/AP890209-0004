(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Several government and universityscientists contend a recent series of newspaper stories exaggeratedthe threat to humans from selenium in food.   Executive Editor Gregory Favre of The Sacramento Bee, whichpublished the series on Dec. 4-5, said the newspaper was ``confidentof the accuracy of our reporting and of our analysis.''   The critics are led by Richard Jacobs of the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration and Gerhard Schrauzer, a chemistry professor at theUniversity of California at San Diego, who said the Bee stories``needlessly raised fears concerning the safety of the foods we eat....''   The stories, summarized in an account distributed to papersnationwide by The Associated Press, said selenium had been found infood from supermarkets across the nation at levels high enough toslowly poison millions of high-risk Americans such as the veryyoung, the old and the chronically ill.   Schrauzer criticized the stories for ``reporting doubtful data onthe selenium levels of common foods'' and ``grossly exaggerating thetoxicity of selenium ....''   Selenium, a natural element in soil, is essential to life insmall concentrations but can be toxic at higher levels.   ``Reports contending that millions of Americans are at risk ofselenium poisoning are unfounded and irresponsible,'' Schrauzersaid, ``as are the claims that the foods regularly consumed byAmericans contain unsafe levels of the element.''   The Bee reported that illnesses ranging from stomach upsets todeath occurred in rural western residents who had been exposed tosignificant amounts of selenium. The newspaper said that at leastone person, an Oregon rancher, died of the disease, while otherssuffered paralysis, loss of hair, skin rashes, hypertension andother maladies attributable to selenium.   Favre said the newspaper believes its stories were accurate andhopes ``that the FDA and other government agencies will not turntheir backs on a potential health hazard'' because of any disputeover the Bee's data.   ``The laboratories the Bee used in the testing process arerecognized by many states as among the finest labs for this type oftest. We are confident that the results they found and which wepublished are accurate.''   The Bee said it hired private laboratories to study the seleniumcontent in foods in ``dry weight'' form, with all moisture removed.The newspaper then figured average daily intake by translating thedry weights into equivalents of fresh foods as they would beconsumed.   The scientists criticizing those articles have focusedprincipally on the calculations which the Bee used to translate thedry weights into average meals, rather than on the selenium levelsfound in tests conducted for the Bee.   Bee reporter Tom Harris, who wrote the stories, defended the useof dry-weight calculations, saying there has been a ``dramaticevolution'' in the scientific community's opinions on which systemto use, and that the once-universal wet-weight method is giving wayto the more scientifically accurate dry-weight system.   A major problem with wet-weight calculations, Harris said, isthat they lead to underestimation of intake.   But Thomas Jukes, a biophysics professor at UC Berkeley, who sayshe participated in the discovery that selenium was essential tolife, said the stories ``need to be scrutinized and revised based onthe actual content of selenium in foods, which they miscalculated.''   Anna Fan, chief of the state Department of Health Services'office of food toxicology in Berkeley, also said the Bee'sassessment of dietary selenium intake ``is not consistent withscientific literature for the last 10 to 15 years.''   Jacobs, supervising chemist of the federal FDA's San Franciscooffice, said the Bee's conclusions were ``without scientific merit.''   ``There is no evidence to suggest millions of people are gettingtoo much selenium in their diet,'' Jacobs said.   The primary problem with the story, he said, was not the Bee'sdata, but its ``misleading'' interpretation of that data.   The story used an example of a person eating 6 ounces of dry eggsin a meal, implying that 6 ounces would be a normal serving, Jacobssaid. But the fresh equivalent of 6 ounces is 11 extra-large eggs, a10-fold exaggeration of what someone would consume at a typicalmeal, he said.   ``Similar reductions in calculated intakes can be made for otherfoods from (the Bee) article....,'' Jacobs said.   Harris said he based the formula for determining how much someonewould consume in dry-weight equivalents on information gathered fromseveral credible scientists and nutritionists, and that his dataindicates that 6 ounces dry weight would equal 2{ to 3 extra largefresh eggs.   However, nutritionist Joanne Ikeda of UC Berkeley, who was notconsulted by the Bee and is not among critics who have come forward,said that 6 ounces of dry eggs are equivalent to 12 extra-largefresh eggs.</TEXT></DOC>
