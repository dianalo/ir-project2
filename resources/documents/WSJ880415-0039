In extraordinarily turbulent trading, prices of long-term Treasury bonds dropped about 1 1/2 points, or $15 for each $1,000 face amount. That was the largest setback since March 28, although it paled in comparison to the stock market's plunge of more than 100 points.    Shouts of amazement and consternation reverberated through bond trading rooms as the trade numbers crossed news wires yesterday morning at 8:30 EDT. The $13.83 billion trade gap for February was larger than even the most pessimistic forecasts in one recent survey of 18 economists -- and well above the consensus estimate of $11 billion to $11.5 billion. &quot;This is an unequivocally bad number,&quot; said Elliott Platt, a senior vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc.    The disappointing trade news sent the dollar reeling in foreign exchange markets. That intensified speculation that the Federal Reserve will tighten credit again, raising interest rates further, to support the dollar and contain inflation pressures. Speculation also is mounting that banks soon will raise their prime lending rate. Some bankers expect the prime, or base, rate, now 8 1/2%, will jump to at least 8 3/4% and possibly even 9%.    An important factor in the Fed's thinking will be this morning's report on producer prices. Although the report is expected to show a modest increase of only 0.2% last month, some economists fear a significantly larger increase. That, they say, would quickly lead to a credit-tightening move by the Fed.    Alarmed by the stock market's collapse, many investment managers sold bonds yesterday and bought the safest, most secure investments available: short-term Treasury bills. At one stage early yesterday afternoon, bond prices were down more than two points in heavy trading.    But as stock prices fell further late yesterday, bonds recovered somewhat. Traders said the stock market's plight prompted widespread fears of a replay of last October's Black Monday, which quickly led to a powerful bond market rally.    Some money managers contended that investors overreacted and that this is a good time to buy long-term bonds. &quot;I think looking at one month's trade figure and panicking is just goofy,&quot; said Greta E. Marshall, investment manager of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which manages about $45 billion.    &quot;I think this represents another buying opportunity&quot; in the bond market, said Ms. Marshall, who made a similar observation last autumn shortly before bonds began their huge rally. &quot;We haven't seen anything in the underlying economy that concerns us -- either excessive growth or any increase in inflation. So it's a good opportunity to accumulate long-term positions.&quot;    As of late yesterday, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds stood at about 8 7/8%. That was up from around 8 3/4% Wednesday and 8 3/8% as recently as the end of February.    Wayne F. Wong, a managing director at Marinvest Inc., a subsidiary of Marine Midland Banks Inc., is leery of long-term bonds. But he also believes it would be a mistake to buy only short-term Treasury bills. Instead, he purchased four-year Treasury notes yesterday, along with some four-year Federal Home Loan Bank notes.    The trade news was &quot;quite negative for the bond market,&quot; Mr. Wong said. &quot;But going 100% into short-term Treasury bills doesn't make sense, either. I see value in the four-year area.&quot; Late yesterday, four-year Treasury notes yielded about 8%, compared with slightly more than 5 3/4% on three-month Treasury bills.    Salomon Brothers analysts predict the dollar will drop further by year end and that U.S. interest rates will surge. As a result, they urge investors to diversify into foreign bonds. A 22-page report released earlier this week contended that French and British government bonds &quot;provide the best combination of potential currency strength and attractive yield.&quot;    The news of a huge trade deficit and a large jump in imports came only a day after investors were startled by a government report showing a strong increase in retail sales last month. The reports fueled fears that the economy will overheat, leading to higher inflation and increased interest rates.    &quot;You've probably had as bad a series of numbers as you can imagine over the past two days&quot; for the bond markets, said James R. Capra, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. &quot;The fundamentals suggest stronger economic activity and the potential for higher inflation.&quot;    Today's producer price report is &quot;especially important,&quot; Mr. Capra continued. &quot;If it's significantly higher than expectations -- say 0.6% or 0.7% -- then I think you could look for the Fed to tighten at any time.&quot;    The producer price report will be released by the Labor Department at 8:30 a.m. EDT. Also scheduled for release today is the Federal Reserve's industrial production report for March. According to a survey of 10 economists by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, industrial production rose a meager 0.1% last month. Estimates ranged from no change to an increase of 0.3%.    Because of the dollar's woes, there is a &quot;definite possibility&quot; the Fed will tighten credit further very soon, perhaps as early as today, said Mr. Platt of Donaldson Lufkin. &quot;I think the Fed probably is being pressured by the finance ministers of other countries&quot; to raise interest rates to support the dollar, he said.    A few bond traders say the Fed might even go a step further and raise its discount rate, the fee it charges on loans to banks and savings institutions. The discount rate now is 6%. But others disagreed strongly. They argued that the economy and banking system aren't strong enough to withstand such a harsh move, especially in view of the heavily publicized woes of Texas banks and savings institutions.    A discount rate increase now &quot;is unlikely,&quot; said Mr. Platt. &quot;That would be premature and far too drastic&quot; a move.    In addition to worries about the inflation outlook, some investment managers also are concerned about a huge wave of U.S. government borrowing coming soon. The Treasury is expected to announce plans May 4 to sell about $26 billion of notes and bonds in its quarterly refunding operation.    The Treasury's financing package likely will consist of three-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. Interest rates often rise around the time of these big quarterly financing operations.    In the bond markets yesterday, the most actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds traded as low as about 99 1/4 to yield 8.95%. They later recovered to close at 99 29/32 to yield 8.88%. That compared with Wednesday's close of 101 14/32, yielding 8.74%.    The government's 8 1/8% notes due 1998 dropped to 96 3/8 from 97 1/4. The yield rose to 8.68% from 8.54%.    The Treasury's new seven-year notes, sold Tuesday at an average annual yield of 8.44%, were quoted late yesterday at 8.48%. The price of the issue fell to 99 15/32 from Tuesday's average price at auction of 99.662.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury issues dropped 15.88 points, its largest drop in about 2 1/2 weeks, to close at 1260.79. The high was 1265.56, and the low was 1253.24.    The investor rush to buy short-term Treasury bills represented what traders refer to as a &quot;flight to quality&quot; that typically accompanies chaotic market conditions. As a result, rates fell on three-month Treasury bills. The rate on the latest three-month bills declined to 5.78% bid from 5.82% Wednesday. But rates on six-month bills rose slightly to 6.07% bid from 6.04%.    The federal funds rate averaged about 6 3/4% yesterday, as expected. The rate on funds, or reserves banks lend each other overnight, averaged 6.67% Wednesday. If the Fed tightens credit further, as some analysts predict, the funds rate could climb to about 7%.    Mr. Platt predicted: &quot;If the Fed takes the funds rate to 7%, I suspect the prime rate will go up&quot; half a percentage point to 9%. </TEXT></DOC>
