As welfare rolls grow, the federal Low-Income Home EnergyAssistance Program gets a bit smaller and later, pressingutility bill relief efforts, says the Edison ElectricInstitute. Part of the problem: Washington budgetry deferspartial funding until Sept. 30, 1992, so many states nowgrapple with a winter money gap. Pennsylvania, for one, willfund its $26 million shortfall up front from state coffers.Still, Philadelphia Electric Co. urges families to seek aidearly.                                                                                                          Energy credit and dollar checkoff gift programs may alsobe strapped. Michigan's Consumers Power Co. increases creditsfor distressed billpayers fivefold, to $1.2 million. NorthernStates Power, Brooklyn Union Gas and others again join theSalvation Army on programs. Cincinnati Gas andamp; Electric andothers stress conservation by helping to weatherproof homes.Boston Edison Co. suggests $25 gift certificates as presentsfor people on fixed incomes.   Richard Ferreira of the American Public WelfareAssociation worries that &quot;The need is going to go unmet.&quot;                                                                                                          CAN THE CRANBERRIES or go with processed. The fresh onesfaded fast.   Despite a bumper crop, the red berries disappear fromproduce counters across the U.S. &quot;They would have spoiled,lots of them,&quot; says Chris Phillips, of Ocean SprayCranberries, the Massachusetts firm whose affiliated growersharvest 85% of the crop. Sure, there's plenty of canned,frozen, juiced and sauced material around since 90% of outputis processed anyway. But fanciers of fresh pay $1.79 per bag(if one can be found), not the 89-cent recent low.   Ocean Spray blames Mother Nature. It says the crop ripenedwell and fast in the bog but broke down on shelves quicker,too. Lou Modini, who runs Cape Ann Markets in Massachusetts,sent back his bad bags. &quot;A day before Thanksgiving and we hadno berries,&quot; he laments, eyeing a Christmas gap. Other storesjust ran out before the fruit gave out. Ocean Spray admitspeople &quot;are not pleased,&quot; and &quot;they're making that known tous.&quot;                                                                                                          SUGARPLUMS DANCE briefly -- but profitably -- for ballettroupes.   &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; may mean Christmas to children, but itmeans fiscal survival to many dance companies. &quot;It's theannual cash cow. We rely on it,&quot; says Luise Moskowitz of theailing Pennsylvania Ballet. She says ticket sales for theDecember performances are expected to provide $2.2 million ofthe group's total $7 million budget. The San Francisco Balletaims for $3.5 million in ticket sales, and the New York CityBallet notes its &quot;Nutcracker&quot; ticket sales account for about17% of its budget.   Corporate sponsors supplement profits that are banked forfuture works. &quot;`The Nutcracker' is the most identifiableproduct we produce in terms of the `warm and fuzzies,'&quot; saysDavid Gray of the New York City Ballet, whose lead sponsor isNew York Telephone. San Francisco, which danced the firstU.S. &quot;Nutcracker,&quot; is backed by Philip Morris's Yuban Coffee.Pennsylvania Ballet now &quot;sells&quot; individual nights to sponsorsfor about $5,000.   Ballethnic Dance Company in Atlanta created &quot;UrbanNutcracker,&quot; an inner-city version that raised $30,000 --enough for eight months.                                                                                                          EATING OUT in New York still costs far more than in othercities despite a finicky Eastern economy, says the latestZagat Surveys. The average cost of dinner for one in the BigApple was $33.73, up 20% from second-place Los Angeles's$27.91. At the bottom of the list, Kansas City's $12.64 bill.                                                                                                          FATHER SELLS BEST. &quot;Life's Little Instruction Book&quot; byadvertising executive H. Jackson Brown Jr. for his son sellsmore than a million copies since April. For $5.95, readersget 511 sayings such as &quot;Be loyal&quot; (No. 382); &quot;Sing in achoir&quot; (No. 150) and perhaps most pertinent: &quot;Reread yourfavorite book.&quot; (No. 337).                                                                                                          TAP THIS RAP if your job got zapped. &quot;The Bum Rap,&quot; a75-second tape by David Lord, an editor of ExecutiveRecruiter News in Fitzwilliam, N.H., costs $4.95.                                                                                                          GLOBAL FINANCE systems &quot;speak&quot; in tongues and manycurrencies.   As business crosses country borders, financial recordsbecome a Tower of Babel, accountants say. But new computersoftware helps prepare financial, purchasing and billingreports in many languages. An added benefit: instant currencytranslation of offshore units' reports for the parent.Systems Union Ltd., a British firm, offers software forreporting in a dozen languages, including Arabic, Hungarianand Malaysian, says Robin Morris, its U.S. head.   NCR Corp. says such multilingual reporting helped it mergeaccounting and data-entry staffs in Africa. The computer firmhas already recovered 20% of its software costs throughcost-and-time savings, says Roy Hodgkinson, an NCR manager.Pioneer HiBred International in Des Moines, Iowa, says suchsoftware has speeded up recruiting data-entry staff. &quot;We nolonger have to worry about language or currency-conversionskills,&quot; says Pioneer.   Such systems costing from $3,500 to $100,000 replacemanual reporting for use in mainframe to microcomputers.
