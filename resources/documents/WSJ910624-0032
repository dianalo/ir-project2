The insurance business?</LP><TEXT>   With its lengthening failure list? Where regulatorsrecently took control of major units of First ExecutiveCorp.? Where federal legislators are mulling strictercontrols to replace the industry's haphazard state-runsystem? Where, as a congressional subcommittee puts it, thereare &quot;deeply disturbing&quot; parallels with the early stages ofthe savings-and-loan collapse? Where, unlike Sandamp;Ls or banks,there are no federal deposit guarantees?   Against such a backdrop, optimism doesn't come easily.Yet, optimism -- cautious but unmistakable -- was theoverriding sentiment of the assorted academics, bankers,federal officials, regulators, independent analysts andinsurance executives gathered here last week, near Cape Cod'selbow, to ponder prospects in the insurance business.                                                                                                          A few statistics at the outset provided some perspectivefor the meeting, arranged by the Boston Federal Reserve Bank.Over the past three years, 55 of approximately 2,300U.S.-based insurance companies -- some 2% -- have failed. Bycomparison, more than 25% of 3,000 federally-insured thriftinstitutions are insolvent or in deep trouble; the eventualbail-out cost of this to taxpayers is expected to approximate$500 billion.                                                                                                          Such data, to be sure, don't erase concern that insurers,led by First Executive, are beginning to traipse down thesame miserable path as the thrifts and, more recently, thecommercial banks. This worry clearly underlies increasinglyurgent calls in Congress and elsewhere not only for stricterinsurance regulation but for broader customer guarantees,possibly along lines provided at thrifts and banks.   But there was much aversion here to modeling insurancereform after the arrangements governing such troubledenterprises as banks and Sandamp;Ls.   This mood was expressed by Gerard Brannon, president ofthe Tax Institute of America. The view in Washington, hesaid, favors &quot;full restoration of contractually promisedbenefits to all policyholders.&quot; However, he went on, such aplan surely &quot;will result in the same dynamics that haveplagued banks and thrifts: mounting insolvencies, highpremiums and increased capital requirements.&quot; He concludedthat mutual funds that are relatively free of regulation --as well as of financial difficulties -- may well provide &quot;abetter model&quot; for insurance reform.   Along the same line, Scott E. Harrington, a professor ofinsurance and finance at the University of South Carolina,lamented recent newspaper articles that read, he claimed,&quot;like a commercial for federal guarantees.&quot; How can this be,he wondered, &quot;in light of what's happened in the Sandamp;Lindustry?&quot; A wiser approach, he advised, would be toencourage &quot;better state regulation, aimed at insuring thefinancial integrity of the industry.&quot;                                                                                                          This is beginning to occur, according to Earl R. Pomeroy,in his second term as North Dakota's insurance commissioner.He cited, for example, increased efforts by the NationalAssociation of Insurance Commissioners, comprising the statecommissioners, to bring all states &quot;up to speed&quot; through suchmeans as uniform standards for financial statements, bondevaluations and sanctions for troubled companies.                                                                                                          Terence Lennon, the chief examiner at New York's insurancedepartment, recounted his state's recent moves to prevent newtrouble, including stricter limits on junk-bond holdings. Thecommissioners' group, he also reported, &quot;is writing a modelinvestment law&quot; for the industry, which he viewed as&quot;stressed, not a basket case.&quot;   Important -- and encouraging -- distinctions were drawnbetween insurance and other financial businesses by Thomas E.Moloney, senior vice president and controller of John HancockMutual Life Insurance. For instance, he said, &quot;banks not onlyare less geographically diversified than insurers, but alsoconcentrate their investments in fewer and historicallyhigher-risk investment classes.&quot;                                                                                                          An &quot;important lesson that insurers have learned from thewidespread failures in banking,&quot; the executive added, &quot;is thefalse security and even weakness&quot; that result when federaldeposit guarantees erode &quot;the discipline&quot; of the marketplace.Such a course for the insurance industry would be &quot;nothealthy,&quot; he warned.   Richard W. Kopcke, a vice president and economist at theBoston Fed, attributed the insurance industry's troubles inlarge measure to increased &quot;volatility of interest rates&quot; inthe recent past. This brought greater competition from other&quot;financial intermediaries,&quot; he recalled, and promptedinsurers to promote investment services that &quot;diminishedtheir ability to bear risk.&quot; On a hopeful note, however, hesuggested that this pattern may well reverse with theprospect now of somewhat more stable rates, plus a slowlyrecovering economy.   No one here, it should be added, anticipated atrouble-free future for insurers. As J. Robert Hunter,president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization,observed, &quot;state regulation hasn't worked too well.&quot; But, headded, &quot;I think the states can do the job,&quot; perhaps withguidance from Washington -- but not the sort of &quot;help&quot; thathas left its mark elsewhere in the financial arena.</TEXT></DOC>
