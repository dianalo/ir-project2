More than 200 British companies have subsidiaries in SouthAfrica, despite substantial disinvestment in the past three yearsto protest the government's rigid policies of racial separation,says the report released Tuesday by the Labor Research Department.   The 20 largest of these companies employ a total of 230,000people in South Africa, according to the department, a leftisttrade union research organization.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government opposes mandatoryeconomic sanctions, saying they would hurt the majority blackpopulation and neighboring black states more than South Africa'swhite governing minority.   But a group of foreign ministers from the Commonwealth agreedTuesday to recommend the 48-nation organization of Britain and itsformer colonies adopt a new package of financial sanctions againstSouth Africa.   The ministers also condemned renewed sporting contacts withSouth Africa which threaten the 1990 Commonwealth Games in NewZealand.   Sixteen English cricket players have accepted invitations toplay in South Africa in the next two years, and Australian andBritish rugby players have been asked to compete there later thismonth.   According to the investment report, the biggest British interestin South Africa is the diversified mining company Consolidated GoldFields PLC, which has a 38 percent stake in Gold Fields of SouthAfrica. The gold and coal mining concern employs more than 102,000workers.   However, Hanson PLC said Monday it had completed a takeover ofConsolidated Gold Fields and has said it will sell the miningcompany's South African interests.   That would leave Imperial Chemical Industries PLC in top placewith a 38 percent stake in AECI, the South African chemicalscompany which employs 26,500 workers, the report said.   Lonrho PLC ranks third, with interests in platinum, coal andgold mines, employing 9,428 workers.   The report said Lonrho apparently has twice ignored voluntaryEuropean Economic Community codes which seek to prevent newinvestment in South Africa. Since 1986, Lonrho has raised its stakein Western Platinum from 50 to 99 percent and revealed its 100percent ownership of Eastern Platinum.   Other major British employers in South Africa include TrafalgarHouse, Unilever, Pilkington, BOC Group, BTR, BAT Industries,Rolls-Royce, RTZ, Blue Circle Industries, Great Universal Storesand Cadbury Schweppes, the report states.   Rolls-Royce recently joined the list by acquiring NorthernEngineering Industries, which, the report says, profits frominternational sanctions by manufacturing car engines that are nolonger built locally because other American and British car makershave left.   Several major British companies have pulled out of South Africain recent years, the report says, including the two big banks,Barclays PLC and Standard Chartered, the packaging firm Metal Box,cable company BICC and engineering firms IMI and Glynwed.   The Anti-Apartheid Movement estimates total direct and indirectinvestment in South Africa by British companies was about $10.24billion, down from about $12.6 billion in 1987. Britain is SouthAfrica's third-largest trading partner behind Japan and WestGermany.   Tuesday's report says the disinvestment campaign has had moresuccess in the United States than in Britain in part becausemunicipal and educational bodies have threatened to cancel largecontracts if companies did not sever their South African ties.</TEXT></DOC>
