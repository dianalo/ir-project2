Janet Hale was informed of the move late Thursday by budgetdirector Richard Darman, not long after she was notified that shewould be asked to appear before a congressional subcommitteeinvestigating allegations of mismangement at HUD during the Reaganadministration.   Ms. Hale works in the Office of Management and Budget and herduties, until Thursday, included oversight of the entire HUD budget.Before moving to the White House she worked for several years atHUD, rising to deputy assistant secretary of housing.   Darman's action came a day after HUD Secretary Jack Kempannounced the suspension of a third agency program, providinghousing for low and moderate-income elderly people, as part of theprobe of corruption and mismanagement at the department.   Barbara Clay, an OMB spokeswoman, said today that Ms. Hale wastold not to handle any HUD matters that relate to the investigationbut can continue to work on other agency activities.   Congressional investigators are looking into at least twoprojects Ms. Hale handled while at HUD, including approval of aNorth Carolina project involving a longtime friend of former HUDSecretary Samuel Pierce.   ``For the time being, any matters specifically involving the HUDinvestigation or the HUD actions under investigation should behandled   ... without your involvement,'' Darman said in a note to Ms. Hale.   He noted that Ms. Hale herself had suggested the reassignmentafter being summoned by the subcommittee. ``I have concluded thatthis is the the best interest of OMB _ and I'm inclined to thinkthat for the periodf of the investigation it is also in your ownbest interest,'' the OMB director said.   The memo was first reported in today's editions of The BostonGlobe.   Kemp's decision Thursday on the elderly-housing program follows ahighly critical audit of the program by HUD's inspector general thatsaid many of the projects were approved despite warnings by agencyanalysts that they were unnecessary or too large.   The program already has cost the government $119 million indirect payments to cover defaults on HUD-insured mortgages, Kempsaid. The cost is likely to grow, he said, because defaults nowtotal $250 million and are expected to continue.   Kemp also said the program was not serving those it was createdto help, citing a HUD-backed project in Palm Harbor, Fla., that hesaid charged $2,100 a month rent for a two-bedroom apartment.   He promised to revive the Retirement Service Center Program afterrewriting its guidelines to target resources to low-income elderly.   ``Insured housing programs administered by HUD must by theirnature take risks,'' Kemp said. ``With this program costing $120million to date, I would rather take these risks by targetingresources ... to lower-income people.''   Kemp is reviewing HUD programs as Congress and law enforcementofficials investigate allegations of widespread mismanagement duringthe Reagan administration.   Testimony and other evidence shows influential Republicanconsultants were hired by developers to win favor for HUD projects.   Also Thursday, an aide to the House subcommittee investigatingHUD and calling Ms. Hale to testify said several prior witnesseswill be recalled, including former HUD Secretary Pierce.   Pierce earlier told the subcommittee he had no direct role infunding decisions. But a former agency official, Shirley McVayWiseman, since has said Pierce ordered her to approve funding for aNorth Carolina project involving a longtime Pierce associate.   Also among those to be recalled are Thomas T. Demery, formerassistant secretary for housing; Lance Wilson, Pierce's former topaide; and Republican political consultant Paul Manafort, who hasadmitted ``influence-peddling'' to secure HUD funding for a NewJersey project.   The congressional investigation has focused largely on threeprograms: HUD's acquisition and sale of single-family property, itsfunding for rehabilitation of rental properties and its co-insuringof mortgages for certain housing developments.   A dozen private closing agents contracted for the single-familyprogram are under investigation for allegedly bilking the agency of$20 million or more.   Kemp has suspended the rehabilitation program and canceledanother program in which HUD backed loans for such projects as agolf course-residential complex. Both involved lobbying by prominentRepublicans.   The five-year-old elderly housing venture involved 150developments. Kemp said he suspended it because 30 percent of theprojects whose mortgages were fully backed by HUD and another 12percent of those in which HUD guaranteed 80 percent of the loan werein default. The second default rate is expected to climb, officialssay.   The program was designed to provide housing to people over age 70who can live on their own and afford market rents. The centers offersuch services as central dining and recreation.   An audit of 24 retirement centers in the Midwest found six werein default or had their mortgages assigned to HUD, and six wereconsidered financially troubled.   In most of those cases, HUD field offices approved the number ofapartments sought by developers although agency economists warnedthe local housing market could not support the full project.   In one case, HUD assumed mortgage payments for a Minnesotafacility that HUD economists had recommended be rejected. Only 76 ofthe complex's 208 units were rented as of May 1988, 19 months afterit opened.   The economist who recommended rejection had noted the developmentwould be in an isolated area overlooking a gravel pit, ``clearlyremote from major population centers.''   The audit did not identify the project by name and HUD officialsat the field office that handled the case did not return telephonecalls Thursday.   In another case, auditors said the Cincinnati HUD office agreedto insure a 254-unit development despite an agency economist'sfindings that the market would support just 125 units. In May 1988,nearly three years after New England Village opened, only 67 of the254 units were occupied and the mortgage was in default.   The report listed four projects in Cincinnati with mortgagestotaling $35.2 million and two others in the Minneapolis-St. Paularea totaling $17.9 million that were ``in default or consideredfinancially troubled.''</TEXT></DOC>
