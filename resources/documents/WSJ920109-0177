The Bush administration had hoped that making thepresident's trip a trade and jobs mission would provide botha tonic for an ailing U.S. economy and a boost to thepresident's sagging image in economic affairs. But the&quot;action plan&quot; Japan intends to announce today will do littleto address the U.S. recession. And in public relations terms,the trip has fallen far short of its goal.</LP><TEXT>   The worst moment symbolically came Wednesday evening(Tokyo time), when the president slumped over in his chair ata state dinner and vomited on Prime Minister KiichiMiyazawa's pant leg. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwaterlater dismissed the incident as the result of a bout with theflu.   But the embarrassing moment, while understandable giventhe president's rigorous schedule, simply added to the trip'sawkwardness. Most notably, Mr. Bush has been lampooned inboth the U.S. and Japan for seemingly being reduced tohawking cars that the Big Three auto makers can't sellthemselves.   &quot;This trip was a loser,&quot; says William Niskanen, a formerchief economist for Ford Motor Co. and Reagan economicadviser who is now chairman of the libertarian CatoInstitute. &quot;I think it demeans the presidency for him to actlike a car salesman.&quot;   More important, economists and trade experts say the tripcan't possibly do much to help end the U.S. recession.Measures to open up the Japanese market to U.S. automobilescertainly won't help much until Detroit makes cars that meetJapanese needs, with features like right-hand steeringwheels. (As in Britain, people in Japan drive on theleft-hand side of the road.) Ford says it plans to do so, butwill need 20 months. Moreover, plans by Japanese auto makersto buy more U.S. auto parts won't fully take effect until1995, offering little help in the near term.   &quot;There is no way it's going to do anything about therecession, no way it is going to do anything about theoverall U.S. jobs picture,&quot; says Paul Krugman, an economistat the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &quot;Even if we goteverything we ever wanted from the Japanese, it wouldn'thappen fast enough to be at all relevant to our recession.&quot;   U.S. and Japanese negotiators agreed early Thursday onmeasures to be included in the action plan. Full details wereset for release later in the day. Throughout thenegotiations, automobiles were the focus of attention, withJapanese companies promising both to help sell U.S. cars inJapan and to increase sharply their purchases of U.S.-madeparts.   As part of the action plan, Japan's Big Five auto makersare setting procurement goals for the year ending in March1995 of about $20 billion in foreign parts, up from thecurrent level of about $8 billion. Over time, those increasedpurchases could provide significant new business to U.S.auto-parts makers.   Republicans tried to play down the significance of Mr.Bush's sick spell and play up the Asian trip's successes. Butthey concede the administration's public buildup of the tripmay have been too great. Not surprisingly, Democrats werequick to take swipes at the trip's shortcomings. MichaelMcCurry, an aide to presidential candidate Bob Kerrey, wentso far as to call Mr. Bush's indisposition &quot;a metaphor forthe entire trip: The United States stumbling, staggering, onits knees, looking for something to cure its ills.&quot;   Mr. Bush's illness is also, inevitably, focusing renewedpublic attention on Vice President Dan Quayle's fitness forthe top office. Despite efforts to polish his image, Mr.Quayle is still viewed negatively by 38% of voters in themost recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, and positivelyby only 32%.   To judge how the president's trip is playing with thepublic, The Wall Street Journal talked to a handful of peoplein auto-sensitive Kalamazoo, Mich. A number of these voters,members of a Journal-sponsored group that meets periodicallyto discuss political issues, were strongly critical of thepresident's trip, and especially of his bringing with him 21chief executives.   &quot;It's hard for me to sympathize with a {corporateexecutive} making $2 million a year telling the Japanese howtough times are here at home,&quot; said Rob Britigan, a propertymanagement executive and a big Bush booster. Don Warren, atelephone technician and a disillusioned Bush Democrat, saidthe trip &quot;won't produce any jobs here at home.&quot;   The Kalamazoo voters were less concerned about thepresident's health. &quot;It's embarrassing, but it could happento any of us,&quot; said Edith Pontius, a conservative politicalindependent.   If the trip is playing poorly in the U.S., it's doing evenworse in Japan. The Japanese press has kidded Mr. Bushmercilessly, focusing both on his &quot;rudeness&quot; in demandinggifts -- trade concessions -- and on his role assuper-salesman. The Asahi Evening News, an English-languageversion of one of Japan's most prestigious dailies, carriedan opinion-page column headlined &quot;The Ill-Mannered Visitor.&quot;In another paper, Mr. Bush was portrayed as a street vendorwith a table full of tiny cars.   But Japanese government officials, eager to see Mr. Bushre-elected, sought to put the best face on events, includinghis sick spell. Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe said thepresident was just &quot;tired.&quot; Interviewed on Japanesetelevision, former top trade negotiator Naohiro Amaya saidthe president's illness &quot;is a symbolic event. America istired -- but not critically ill.&quot; Japanese officials havebeen justifying the new trade concessions to the Japanesepublic as repayment for U.S. largess to Japan after World WarII, and despite the lampooning in the press many Japaneseseem receptive to this theme.   Mr. Bush's trip has been punctuated throughout with gaffesthat seem to symbolize his discomfort with his role. InAustralia, he innocently held up two fingers at protesters inwhat he thought was a peace sign, only to find it isconsidered an obscene gesture there. At the Shishinden Palacein Kyoto, Mr. Bush was invited to watch a demonstration of aneighth-century court game called Kemari that involvesintricate kicking around of a horsehair football. Uninvited,the president joined in the fun, even bouncing the ball offhis head -- a move not allowed under the game's rules.   Through it all, the 67-year-old president has kept up anexhausting pace. He shook hands on street corners, took teawith locals, lunched with foreign business executives andeven cut the ribbon on a new toy store. In between scheduledevents, he jogged and used exercise equipment in Australiaand in Singapore. In Tokyo, he even played tennis with theemperor and the crown prince. He lost.   In his public events, Mr. Bush has continually returned tothe theme of trade and jobs, in comments that seem scriptedto convince the American public that his skills in overseasaffairs could have an economic payoff at home.   And indeed, some trade experts welcome Mr. Bush's newconcern about economic matters. &quot;I think he's doing the rightthing, although for the wrong reasons and in the wrong way,&quot;says Clyde Prestowitz, a former Commerce Department officialwho heads the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington thinktank. &quot;For whatever reason, he is addressing in ahigh-priority way the central issues that exist between usand the Asians, and those are trade and economic questions.&quot;Mr. Prestowitz's chief concern is that, since he believes thepresident has adopted this strategy solely for politicalreasons, Mr. Bush may abandon it once his political problemsease.   Some analysts see nothing wrong with the president'sdecision to take along U.S. corporate chieftains. &quot;I don'tmind Bush taking these CEOs on the road,&quot; says Michael Aho,director of economic studies at the Council on ForeignRelations. &quot;This is what other heads of state do all thetime.&quot;   But even some of the president's defenders, such as formerU.S. trade representative William Brock, argue it was amistake to allow the trip to focus on automobiles. &quot;I thinkit has distracted both sides from some areas where theeconomic opportunity is greater,&quot; he says.   Mr. Niskanen of the Cato Institute adds that, byhighlighting the auto issue, Mr. Bush may inadvertently givea push to Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that hestrongly opposes, but which is implicitly backed by U.S.auto-industry leaders. That legislation would require theJapanese to eliminate the trade imbalance with the U.S. overthe next five years, and would likely force the Japanese tosharply restrict their auto exports to the U.S.   It isn't just President Bush who's had problems on thetrip. The U.S. auto makers have also suffered from a rash ofbad public relations, both in the U.S. and Japan. And theyhave been something of an embarrassment both to the presidentand to other business executives on the trip by publiclypushing for measures to eliminate Japan's trade surplus withthe U.S. over five years.   Most of the executives on the trip &quot;do have a differentagenda&quot; than the auto makers, says a U.S. official in Japan.Heinz Prechter, chairman and chief executive of ASC Inc., anauto-parts maker, says that, while he sympathizes with theauto makers, &quot;there's no doubt that a lot of the problem isthe domestic industry.&quot; Administration officials explain theyhad no choice but to invite the car-company chiefs becauseautos account for such a large portion of U.S. imports fromJapan.   In the end, however, Mr. Bush's widely televised sickspell may remain the most poignant memory from this trip.&quot;That may have been the high point,&quot; says Bill Cunningham, atrade lobbyist with the AFL-CIO in Washington. &quot;He's notgoing to get any significant trade concessions. At least hegets sympathy for working while he's sick.&quot;   ---   Staff reporters James M. Perry in Washington and Urban C.Lehner in Tokyo contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
