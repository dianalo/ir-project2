Union Offers Contract Tied To Ending Sale Plan </HL><SO> </SO><CO> SBG.A LABOR </CO><IN> TNM RET </IN><DATELINE> MONTREAL  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A union representing 8,000 employees of Steinberg Inc. offered the company a five-year no-strike contract, if it agrees not to sell its corporate supermarket operations.    As previously reported, Steinberg, a large retail and real estate concern, is seeking buyers for its core Canadian food retailing and wholesaling divisions, in the wake of a rift in the Steinberg family, which controls the company. It previously had said it was seeking bids for the entire company.    A Steinberg spokeswoman said, however, that even if the food operations are sold, the company's board still may entertain offers for the rest of the company.    &quot;We want to avoid the dismantling of this company store by store,&quot; said Jacques Toupin, president of Local 500 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represents the 8,000 workers at 80 Steinberg supermarkets in the Montreal area. Steinberg has a total of 36,000 employees.    Mr. Toupin said the union is willing to agree to a five-year extension of its current contract, which expires in September, provided the company remains majority Quebec-owned and that job security is guaranteed. The union offer doesn't propose changes in contract conditions, but seeks annual wage increases to cover inflation.    The spokeswoman wouldn't comment on the union's offer. She said Steinberg is planning to sell the assets on &quot;a piece by piece&quot; basis, as a way of maximizing shareholder values.    Steinberg's Class A shares closed yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 38 Canadian dollars ($30.04), off 1.50 dollars.    Among the assets Steinberg wants to sell are 195 supermarkets in Quebec and Ontario, a chain of 72 convenience stores, its food wholesaling division and a Toronto meat processing plant.    If the assets are sold, Steinberg would be left with its large real estate holdings; an Arizona supermarket chain; a 50% stake in Lantic Industries Inc., a large Canadian sugar refiner, and a range of other interests. </TEXT></DOC>
