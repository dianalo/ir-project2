The measure, an amendment to a sweeping trade bill, is designed to increase pressure on the administration to negotiate with Japan for greater access for U.S. goods, including auto parts and supercomputers.    The Ways and Means Committee, nearing completion of the bill, yesterday modified a subcommittee's version by transferring to the U.S. trade representative from the president the authority to determine what form of retaliation to take against certain unfair trade practices.    The panel also approved an amendment to mandate retaliation against any country that isn't complying with an agreement to eliminate an unfair trade practice. That provision is aimed at Japan's noncompliance with an agreement on semiconductors.    Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) expects final committee action on the legislation today, and even after yesterday's amendments, the bill remains less protectionist than the version introduced earlier this year.    The panel made one change yesterday to address a Reagan administration complaint. The bill originally directed the U.S. trade representative to negotiate with foreign countries that manipulate their currencies to hurt U.S. trade. Yesterday, the committee switched that authority to the Treasury Department.    The measure aimed at ending collusive behavior by private companies in a foreign country wouldn't mandate U.S. action; the president still would have discretion. But Rep. Sander Levin (D., Mich.), who introduced the amendment, said the explicit designation of this activity as an unfair trade practice would give the U.S. more negotiating leverage with Japan, and would make action by the administration more likely.    Currently, the U.S. and Japan are engaged in talks designed to get Japan to buy more U.S. auto parts.    The panel also approved an amendment that would expand the U.S. trade representative's authority, allowing him to decide whether to retaliate in cases of unfair trade practices. The subcommittee's version would have given the trade representative authority only to determine whether an unfair trade practice exists.    &quot;It's a strong statement from the committee that somebody in this government has got to do something on our trade problems,&quot; said Rep. J.J. Pickle (D., Texas), who sponsored the amendment.    Some lawmakers have complained that President Reagan hasn't taken retaliatory actions as often as warranted. Giving the authority to the trade representative, they believe, would make retaliation against foreign countries more likely.    But before Rep. Pickle's amendment could pass, a compromise was reached, stipulating that the trade representative's decision on mandatory retaliation would be &quot;subject to specific direction from the president.&quot;    Although the legislation would add violations of unfair trade practice agreements to the list of actions requiring retaliation, it would still allow the administration to waive retaliation if it &quot;is not in the U.S. national economic interest.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
