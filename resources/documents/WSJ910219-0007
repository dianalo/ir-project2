Under the new rules, the Commerce Department for the firsttime would control all exports of manufacturing facilities,plant designs and processing equipment associated with themanufacture of chemical and biological weapons. The rulesalso would require licenses for the shipment of even commonlyavailable goods such as trucks and typewriters if they aredestined for facilities that produce such weapons or missilesthat can deliver them.</LP><TEXT>   The new rules also would expand the list of goods that aresubject to export controls because they could be used in thedevelopment of nuclear weapons.   In another precedent-setting change, the rules wouldestablish criminal penalties for violations of the exportcontrols. Trade lawyers worry that many U.S. companies wouldrather give up the chance to do business than risk the threatof criminal liability posed by this provision.   As late as last weekend, some officials were arguing thatthe rules would be so strict that they would disruptlegitimate trade. But State Department hard-liners appear tohave carried the day by arguing that draconian measures areneeded to deter the West from unwittingly arming anothercountry as it did Iraq.   Also under debate was when the rules should take effect.Some of President Bush's advisers were pushing to make themeffective as soon as they are announced.   One potentially explosive issue still being consideredover the weekend was whether to name the countries believedto be involved in acquiring weapons of mass destruction.Officials said there is little argument about naming somecountries, including Iraq, Libya and Iran. However, citingother likely candidates such as Israel, Argentina, Brazil,India, Pakistan, Syria and Saudi Arabia could backfire. Someare partners in the anti-Iraq coalition while others wieldimportant votes in multilateral trade forums.   &quot;We've never publicly named the so-called bad guysbefore,&quot; said one senior official, who noted that some StateDepartment officials are worried about the potentialdiplomatic fallout.   Meanwhile, to show that it means business, theadministration is considering slapping trade sanctions on anunidentified foreign company that is suspected of havingtraded in currently proscribed technologies. An executiveorder that Mr. Bush signed last November authorizes theadministration to deny such offenders the right to export anygoods to the U.S. or supply any products or services to theU.S. government.   American business groups say they support theadministration's objectives but object to U.S. restrictionsunless other supplying countries adopt similar restraints.&quot;These rules can succeed only if they are transparent,specific and multilateral,&quot; argued Howard Lewis, a tradespecialist for the National Association of Manufacturers.   U.S. officials said they will work long and hard topersuade European and Pacific Rim countries to support therestrictions. Germany has been the only other country thathas indicated its intentions to undertake similarly toughmeasures. U.S. officials acknowledge that it won't be an easytask to bring aboard the other countries.   The Chemical Manufacturers Association said its 180-membercompanies are willing to cooperate, but expressed somemisgivings about the U.S. plan to unilaterally control asmany as 50 chemicals that could be used in chemical weapons.&quot;We're concerned that the world-wide availability of some ofthose chemicals would render any unilateral U.S. controlcompletely ineffective,&quot; warned Michael Walls, theassociation's assistant general counsel.   Some of the chemicals in the control list also are used tomake common commercial products such as fertilizers and flameretardants.</TEXT></DOC>
