A study prepared for Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for the nation's investor-owned utilities, said electric bills in six states could jump an average of more than 10% a year over 20 years. It said the increase could average 5% a year in 13 additional states and the District of Columbia. The 12 hardest-hit utilities could see average rate increases of more than 25% a year, according to the study.    The Bush proposal, which hits coal-fired utilities the hardest in its quest to reduce acid rain, has pegged costs to utilities at $4 billion a year over 30 years. It estimates that electric bills nationwide would rise only an average 2% a year, with the highest increases in any state 5% to 6% a year.    The study said utilities could trim the cost of reducing their emissions 20% to 30% if they had more freedom to buy or trade credits for emission reductions than the Bush administration's acid-rain bill would allow, and if they weren't restricted by the president's proposal to cap total emissions. The cap would force utilities as a group to reduce emissions before they add new generating capacity.    The Environmental Protection Agency said the government and trade group estimates are similar except that the utilities underestimated the cost benefits that would arise from the president's pollution trading system. </TEXT></DOC>
