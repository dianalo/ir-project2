Border guards thwarted what appeared to be a mass crossing byintercepting three buses from Budapest near Lake Neusiedl, whichstraddles the border, sources said. They said 300 East Germans werein the buses.   Austrian officials and witnesses said only about 30 East Germansarrived Wednesday. Witnesses at the Klingenbach crossing in Austriasaid they saw Hungarian border guards turn back nearly 20 EastGerman cars.   Arriving East Germans said Hungarian authorities had begunchecking groups of East German tourists in areas away from theborder to try to discourage any who might be contemplating escape.   In Bonn, a newspaper said that East Germany is planning to imposestrict new travel regulations to Hungary to stem the flow ofrefugees.   The Die Welt newspaper, quoting unidentified Western diplomaticsources in East Berlin, said East German officials plan todrastically restrict travel to Hungary by Sept. 1.   The newspaper said visa applications for Hungary are alreadybeing given strict scrutiny. It said only official trips and visitsby trusted party members are being allowed.   The report, given in advance to other news media, was to appearin the newspaper's Thursday edition.   Flight from East Germany through Hungary started in May, afterthe liberal communist regime in Budapest began removing barbed wireand other obstacles from its border with Austria. Permission tovisit the West is rare for East Germans, but they can travel toneighboring Hungary with ease.   West Germany's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday about 3,300 EastGermans had arrived via Austria so far this month, 2,000 of those inthe past four days.   An Associated Press reporter watching the frontier nearMoerbisch, on the Austrian side, said Hungarian guards werepatrolling at intervals of about 130 feet. Some had dogs.   They were covering a stretch of about 2{ miles where many EastGermans had crossed.   Journalists and other observers at the border said the influx wasdown to a trickle at 6 a.m. Wednesday. More than 500 East Germanscrossed the previous day.   One young refugee said of his reasons for fleeing: ``Food anddrink is okay in East Germany, housing is poor, and the rest you canforget.''   Another said: ``There is nothing you can decide freely. You mustalways ask if you may. Then they say yes or no, but you are nevertold why it's no.''   A 23-year-old man from East Berlin said he scaled border fences12 times before being certain he was in Austria. He said themeandering frontier and his unfamiliarity with the terrain hadconfused him.   A refugee from Freiberg, 21, said it took him 27 hours tocomplete his successful escape.   Scores of Austrian citizens who know the border area, and WestGerman tourists with detailed maps, are known to help East Germanscross the border.   ``I don't know their names; they don't know my name,'' said aWest German who helps refugees. ``You've got to help these people.''   Most volunteer their services, but the fees of guides who chargerange up to nearly $500 in West German marks.   Villagers in Austria help new arrivals by providing showers, foodand closting.   ``This assistance comes unsolicited and is spontaneous,'' apolice official said. The local government in Austria's Burgenlandborder province has not become involved in relief efforts.   Shuttle buses provided by West Germany take refugees to Vienna,where they are provided with the necessary papers to continue theirjourney.   In Budapest, the Communist Party daily newspaper Nepszabasagpublished an interview with the border guard involved in the deathMonday of East German refugee Kurt Werner Schulz, 36, who was shot50 feet inside Austria.   The 20-year-old border guard said his gun went off during ascuffle with Schulz.</TEXT></DOC>
