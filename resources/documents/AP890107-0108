Military officials said they believed all the dissident officerswere killed when troops attacked the Philippine Constabularyregional headquarters in Zamboanga, about 500 miles south of Manila.   Soldiers secured the camp Saturday afternoon after nearly 24hours of sporadic fighting with the gunmen holed up inside,according to Gen. Renato de Villa, the country's military chief ofstaff.   The seaside garrison was seized Thursday by eight police officerswho had been fired from their jobs and ordered held in connectionwith a murder investigation. The eight, along with about five oftheir supporters, took hostage the garrison commander and his chiefof staff.   On Friday, scores of armed men, some of whom may have beensoldiers, slipped into the headquarters building to join thecaptors, officials said.   Troops stormed the garrison Friday but withdrew under heavy fire.   On Saturday, the soldiers fired rifles and automatic weapons atthe headquarters and nearby buildings held by the dissidents.   Troops began their final assault after two military helicoptersstrafed the compound with machine guns and another helicopter firedfour rockets, setting the two-story headquarters building on fire.   Armored personnel carriers provided cover fire as soldiers sweptthrough the compound, using tear gas to flush out snipers.   Since the fighting began Thursday, eight soldiers and twocivilians have been wounded, officials said.   The police officers had demanded to be flown to Siasi Island, 125miles southwest of Zamboanga. Officials offered to fly them toanother island if they could prove one of the hostages, Brig. Gen.Eduardo Batalla, was alive.   Officials launched an attack on the garrison after they learnedthat Batalla and the second hostage, Col. Romeo Abendan, had beenslain by the captors.   De Villa said 16 bodies, many mutilated and burned beyondrecognition, were found in the headquarters building and around themosque. He said the bodies of Batalla and Abendan were tentativelyidentified.   The eight police officers, led by Patrolman Rizal Alih, took thegeneral hostage after he dismissed them from the police force andordered them held for an investigation into the 1984 killing ofseven people, authorities said.   Alih had been charged in the November 1984 slaying of Mayor CesarClimaco of Zamboanga but was acquitted. Three weeks after Climaco'sdeath, seven people were killed in a raid on Alih's home.    Last month, Batalla received permission to arrest Alih and theother police officers, all of whom faced possible charges of murderor conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the 1984 raid.   De Villa said investigators were uncertain whether Alih's bodyhad been found among those who died at the garrison.   Maj. Gen. Manuel Cacanando, the southern regional commander, saida 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew would be imposed for several days inZamboanga to allow tension to ease and military reinforcements wouldbe deployed.</TEXT></DOC>
