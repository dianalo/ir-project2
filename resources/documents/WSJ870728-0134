Such delays can be costly because corporations must borrow money to meet deadlines for closing transactions if they don't receive wired funds in time.    A recent survey by the National Corporate Cash Management Association, a 2,000-member organization based in Newtown, Conn., indicates that one in five corporations in the past year reported problems with delays in funds sent over the wire network operated by the Federal Reserve System. In some cases, the delays lasted as long as two hours, the association says.    The problem, cash managers say, is with some banks, not the Fed wire, which is designed to allow the Federal Reserve System and depository institutions to transmit funds and securities quickly and efficiently. The wire daily transmits an average of $500 billion; the typical transaction is $2.5 million. Bankers acknowledge there are problems but assert that the snags are isolated.    Cash managers cite various reasons for the delays. Says Steve McGrath, cash manager for Storage Technology Corp., Louisville, Colo., &quot;Occasionally you get a wire late in the afternoon, and you wonder why it moved so late. The system could be full. The company that's paying you could be waiting until the wire deadline. Or, the company could have initiated the payment earlier, but the bank holds it up because it's up against its overdraft cap.&quot;    The Federal Reserve Board has limited the amounts that banks can be overdrawn on their clearing accounts with the Fed. When a bank bumps into those limits, it delays transmitting funds over the Fed wire until the balance is replenished.    And some banks' computer systems sometimes can't cope with the volume of transfers, which has increased in recent years. The results are backlogs in crediting transfers to individual accounts.    Sue Shellington, assistant director of corporate finance for Bell Atlantic Corp. in Philadelphia, says her company occasionally experiences delays on wire transfers. &quot;Generally, they're no more than an hour, but we have had some delayed two hours,&quot; she says. &quot;We did our own research and found that the delays involved multibank transfers and were generally at the receiving bank's end.&quot;    To head off delays on big transfers, Mrs. Shellington says she alerts banks in advance that a payment is expected. &quot;We try to coordinate things ahead of time.&quot;    Emily Lewis Penn, vice president for cash management at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., says, &quot;This is as much a technology question as a policy question.&quot;    Cash managers worry that delays will grow if the Fed carries through with proposals to further tighten limits on banks' ability to overdraw on their clearing accounts.    &quot;Corporations are expressing increasing discontent with the timeliness&quot; of transfer payments, says Bruce J. Summers, senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va.    Norman Appelman, chairman of the cash management association's government relations committee, says, &quot;This is more than a nuisance. This is a real concern on the part of corporate recipients. Customers don't know whether a vendor has their payment or not.&quot; While he declined to name any banks, Mr. Appelman, who also is vice president for banking relations at ITT Corp.'s ITT Financial Corp. unit in St. Louis, said the problem is real and widespread.    Bankers assert that problems with delays aren't systemic. Donald Monks, executive vice president of Irving Bank Corp. and chairman of the American Bankers Association's operations and automation committee, says, &quot;We don't see a tremendous problem. The situation varies from bank to bank. At Irving, we certainly don't have a problem.&quot;    Michael Urkowitz, executive vice president for operations at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, says, &quot;This is somewhat of a new complaint, but it's not as broad as some would lead you to believe. Beneath it all, some corporations are experiencing some delays that they had not experienced before. But Chase isn't one of those banks.&quot;    Corporate cash managers believe the Fed can help by shelving its plans to lower the ceilings on banks' daily overdrafts.    However, the Fed -- and particularly New York Federal Reserve Bank President Gerald Corrigan -- have grown uneasy about the degree to which some banks have been overdrawing. In effect, the overdrafts amount to unsecured loans from the Fed. At times, banks must send more funds over the Fed wire than they have on deposit with the Fed for the financial system to function smoothly. Otherwise, the payments system would halt. But the Fed feels that the overdrafts have grown too large -- frequently exceeding $80 billion daily -- and that they pose an unacceptable risk to the nation's financial system.    Says Mr. Summers of the Richmond Fed: &quot;If one big player can't settle his position, you'd have payment system gridlock.&quot;    Mr. Summers says that the ratio of banks' payments relative to their reserves with the Fed grew by a factor of 30 between 1960 and 1985. &quot;That means that the average bank is turning over its reserve position 30 times a day,&quot; he explains.    Last year, the Fed directed banks to reduce such overdrafts by 7%. Now the Fed is proposing to reduce those so-called &quot;daylight overdraft caps&quot; an additional 25%.    The cash management association is fighting the tighter limits. Mr. Appelman says, &quot;We feel further tightening will only aggravate the problem. Corporate cash managers are as concerned about risk as the Fed or anyone. However, we don't want to find ourselves paying for a perceived risk as opposed to a real risk.&quot;    Some banks also are cautioning the Fed that banks need time to adapt to the existing overdraft caps before they are further tightened. Says Mr. Monks of Irving Bank: &quot;Too quick an implementation of these changes could have an impact on the ability to make payments on time. The payment flows of the country are more sensitive than the Fed realizes.&quot;    Banks' computer systems also figure in delays of money transfers. &quot;At some banks, the operational efficiencies aren't there,&quot; Mr. Appelman says. &quot;A lot more efficiencies can be accomplished.&quot;    In a step toward greater efficiency, the Fed next year will require banks to use a standard computerized format for wire transfers. Initially, banks that fail to use the format will be charged an added 25 cents a transfer; in 1989, the Fed will reject all transfers that don't use the standard format.    Payment delays are creating opportunities for banks with sophisticated computer systems to woo new corporate customers. Chase's Mr. Urkowitz says, &quot;It's fair to say that for banks with the technology, like Chase, this environment is creating opportunities. Daylight overdraft caps alone are not the basis of competition. It's also what a bank's technological capacity is.&quot;    But, others say that banks have brought the problem on themselves by raising companies' expectations to unrealistic levels. John Kline, senior vice president of Northeast Bancorp's Union Trust Co. unit in Stamford, Conn., says, &quot;It's a problem of expectations. Corporations view these transfers as instantaneous. But like any other system, it has queues all along the way.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
