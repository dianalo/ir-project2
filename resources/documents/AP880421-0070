Police, meanwhile, today released about 30 governing partysupporters who were held hostage by opposition party supporters ina city south of Seoul after a dispute over campaign literature. OnWednesday, about 30 people were injured in scattered violencerelated to the election.   Roh today said his governing Democratic Justice Party mustretain its majority in the assembly in Tuesday's elections toensure national stability and the introduction of full democracy.   ``Whoever violates the law and destroys democratic order must bepunished severely in the name of the people,'' he said in anationally televised news conference.   Opposition leaders charged the government was conspiring to rigthe elections. They warned they would call for a repeat of thenationwide violence that hit the nation last June if the electionsare rigged.   ``The ruling party will face popular resistance and disobedienceif its irregularities and unfair campaigning continue,'' saidopposition leader Kim Dae-jung of the Party for Peace and Democracy.   Rival opposition leader Kim Young-sam of the ReunificationDemocratic Party said he would be forced to make a ``gravedecision'' if the government cheated: ``The Roh regime should notforget the lesson from the June struggle.''   All political parties have been wooing voters with money, mealsand free day trips in frenzied races for assembly seats. But therehas been no sign so far of government election rigging.   Police secured the release early today of about 30 governingparty supporters who were held hostage by the Kim Dae-jung's partyin Youngam, 120 miles south of Seoul.   Police said they promised to investigate a clash between the twogroups.   The opposition supporters seized the Democratic Justice membersafter a quarrel over distributing campaign leaflets and held themin a Peace and Democracy party office that was surrounded by 600riot police.   The hostages were tied up and smeared with red paint.   Angry opposition supporters later marched on a police stationafter police arrested some Peace and Democracy party membersinvolved in the incident. Riot police broke up the protest withvolleys of tear gas and arrested seven people.   At least 33 people were injured Wednesday in scattered clashesbetween government and opposition supporters in the cities ofMasan, Jungju, Kohung and Andong.   Roh appealed for orderly elections and accused the opposition offomenting unrest. He said his party must keep control of theNational Assembly if it is to govern effectively.   ``It is my desire to see the ruling party win a majority ofseats in the National Assembly in order for me to effectively runthe government,'' he said.   The government may have trouble retaining its majority in theassembly because of public reluctance to accept the Roh government.   Roh took office in February after winning a five-yearpresidential term with 33.6 percent of the vote in December afterrival opposition candidates split the opposition vote.   Roh, an ex-general who helped put former President Chun Doo-hwanin power with military backing in 1980, has attempted to cut histies to the authoritarian government he replaced.   He repeated his promise today to ensure full democracy.   The opposition, which was discredited by its internal divisionsduring the presidential election, is struggling to stage a comeback.   It has claimed the government won the presidential election byfraud, but failed to provide evidence.   Opposition leaders have attacked the Roh government with chargesof corruption after former President Chun's brother was arrested inMarch on charges of embezzling millions of dollars.   The opposition also claims Roh will continue military-backedrule.   But the two main opposition parties failed to reunite for theelections and are again fighting for opposition votes. Both aredetermined to emerge as the main opposition force.   Roh, who promised to root out corruption under the Chun regime,today said he would keep his promise to end any official abuse ofpower and ensure a ``clean government.''</TEXT></DOC>
