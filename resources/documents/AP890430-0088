More than 2,900 people were arrested.   The clashes were the first major protests on Seoul's streetssince late last year, and they sent terrified pedestrians runningfor cover.   In scattered clashes, bands of protesters battled the 20,000riot police deployed to block the rally, called on the eve of theinternational labor holiday.   Police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, reporteddozens of injuries.   In Inchon, west of Seoul, and in southeastern Kwangju,protesters also fought police.   Police fired warning shots into the air in Sungnam on Seoul'ssouthern outskirts when about 200 workers and students tried tofirebomb a police station, police said. Five officers were injured.   Radical students, dissidents and workers are mounting violentprotests to demand the overthrow of the government. They also wanthigher wages, better working conditions and a share in SouthKorea's growing economic prosperity. Most South Korean workers earnsubsistence wages for long working weeks.   President Roh Tae-woo's government has warned it may takeemergency steps to halt strikes, which have cost more than $3billion in lost production this year. Government leaders areworried that labor unrest could cripple the economy and fomentpolitical unrest.   Police had no overall figures on the number of protesters inSeoul, but it appeared below 10,000. Rally organizers had claimedthat 100,000 people would take part, but police blocked offoutlying towns near Seoul and prevented workers from leaving forthe capital.   Riot police guarded bus and train stations in Seoul to turn backpeople arriving for the rally. They also blocked off the meetingsite.   The worst fighting raged for about four hours around YonseiUniversity, when about 2,000 students and workers tried to marchpast 5,000 riot police surrounding the campus.   Protesters, many armed with clubs and iron pipes, marched to thebeat of drums and gongs.   ``Knock down the dictatorship which suppresses the masses!''marchers chanted. ``Down with the facist regime!''   Police armored vans opened fire with multiple tear gas launchersbefore the marchers reached the main gate. Enraged students chargedout of the campus and pelted police with hundreds of firebombs androcks.   The police vans fired volley after volley at the chargingprotesters and police repeatedly charged to drive the attackersback. Thick white clouds of choking gas cloaked the campus.   In the crowded main shopping district, hundreds of protestersbriefly clashed with police blocking the rally site. They tore uppaving stones to use as ammunition as passers-by ran for cover.   Police seized dozens of protesters in the downtown clashes,beating and kicking many as they were taken away.   Labor and dissident leaders vowed to hold more protests.   Dissident leaders at Yonsei denounced the Roh government as afront for military dictatorship and called for an anti-governmentuprising.   ``Let's fight and knock down the Roh Tae-woo regime ... Wecannot sit idly. We cannot live like this,'' said dissident leaderLee Suk-hyung.   The radical students and dissidents, however, lack publicsupport because of their extremism and violent tactics.   About 10,000 conservative veterans who served in South Koreanforces in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War staged a peacefulrally in southern Seoul to denounce what they said was a growingleftist threat to the nation.</TEXT></DOC>
