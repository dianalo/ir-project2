VENEZIA</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   JoBeth Williams will portray surrogate mother Mary BethWhitehead-Gould in an ABC television movie about the landmark courtbattle over custody of ``Baby M,'' a network spokeswoman said.   The two-part movie, to air at an undetermined date this spring,will also feature John Shea, Dabney Coleman and Bruce Weitz, ABCspokeswoman Laurel Whitcomb said Tuesday.   The goal of the movie ``is to tell the story without adoptingany one point of view,'' Ms. Whitcomb said in a telephone interviewfrom Los Angeles.   The movie will include an update at the end because the case isstill unfolding, Ms. Whitcomb said.   The latest developments involve legal proceedings to determinethe visitation schedule for Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, whose parentalrights to the 22-month old child were restored in a New JerseySupreme Court decision earlier this month.   The state's highest court overturned a lower court decision thatupheld a $10,000 contract under which Mrs. Whitehead-Gould wasartificially inseminated with William Stern's sperm and bore thechild for him and his wife, Elizabeth.   In addition to stripping Mrs. Whitehead-Gould of her parentalrights, the lower court last March 31 awarded custody to the Sterns.   The Supreme Court maintained custody for the Sterns but voidedthe contract and ruled that Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was entitled to ahearing on visiting the child.   Attorneys for Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and the Sterns have agreed totry to reach an out-of-court settlement on visitation rights.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorney, Harold Cassidy, said Tuesdaythat his client would be seeking more visitation time than thecurrent two hours a week.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who originally called the child Sara,``has agreed to call the child Melissa and do whatever it takes toachieve harmony,'' the attorney said.   Williams starred in ``The Big Chill,'' ``Poltergeist'' and``Kramer vs. Kramer,'' and received an Emmy nomination for her partin the TV movie ``Adam.''   Shea, who starred in ``Witness'' and ``Windy City,'' willportray Stern. Coleman, star of television's ``The Slap MaxwellStory'' will star as Gary Skoloff, the attorney representing theSterns.   Weitz will portray Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's former husband,Richard, whom she divorced last year.   Robin Strasser will portray Elizabeth Stern and Anne Jacksonwill star as Lorraine Abraham, Baby M's court-appointed guardian.</TEXT></DOC>
