Prices charged by manufacturers of finished goods rose a mild 0.4% during the month, the Labor Department said, and much of that increase was accounted for by a surge in prices for natural gas and home heating oil. Excluding the volatile energy and food components, prices rose only 0.1%.    But the prices manufacturers paid for both intermediate and crude goods showed hefty increases, and analysts say these rises could lead manufacturers to boost prices on finished goods in the coming months.    &quot;Inflation looks quiet for the moment, but there are some early warning signs of a mild upturn in the future,&quot; said David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass.    Separately, an economic report issued by the Business Council, a group of corporate chief executives, also noted signs of a potential rise in inflation. The group's economic consultants &quot;agreed that while inflationary signs in the economy remain muted, the underlying trends suggest that inflationary pressures could emerge over the next few months,&quot; according to John Reed, chairman of Citicorp and vice chairman of the council.    The Business Council also predicted the economy would grow 2.4% from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of 1988, and then expand at a slightly slower pace in 1989.    The April rise in the producer price index for finished goods followed a 0.6% increase in March. Broad-based increases in prices for such intermediate goods as metals, chemicals and paper products pushed overall prices for intermediate goods up a strong 0.8% in April, following a 0.6% rise in March. And energy prices helped push crude-goods prices up 1.3% following a 0.4% decline in March.    Also on Friday, the Commerce Department said business inventories continued to grow slowly in March, rising 0.3% following a 0.4% advance in February. The department had previously put the February rise at a slower 0.1%   At the end of March, inventories totaled $719.97 billion. Wholesale inventories showed the biggest gain, rising 0.6% in March, while manufacturing inventories increased 0.2% and retail inventories advanced 0.1%.    Business sales rose strongly during the month, increasing 1.9% to $479.46 billion. As a result, the closely watched inventoryto-sales ratio dropped to 1.5 from 1.53 the prior month.    Some analysts worry that inventories are still too high, and could presage a slowing of the economy later this year, as businesses attempt to reduce their stocks. But for now, sales remain strong despite the inventory overhang.    The price figures and inventory figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.    In delivering the Business Council report on the economy, Mr. Reed of Citicorp said that not only is the U.S. economy growing steadily, but also &quot;the composition of the growth has improved. Net exports and investment in plant and equipment are growing strongly, while government outlays and private consumption are rising more slowly.&quot;    Mr. Reed also said the council's consultants agreed that if the strong expansion didn't slow somewhat in the coming months, &quot;it could produce an unavoidable rise in interest rates and a recession before the end of 1989.&quot;    The group predicted that the trade deficit would improve somewhat in 1988 from 1987. It also predicted the dollar would decline from its current level of about 125 Japanese yen to 119 yen at year end and 115 yen by the end of 1989.
