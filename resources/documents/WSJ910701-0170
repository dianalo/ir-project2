Producers rejected price proposals made by Alberta andamp;Southern, the gas procurement unit of Pacific Gas, for thecontract year beginning Aug. 1. Alberta andamp; Southern offeredlast week to pay $1.50 a thousand cubic feet of gas shippedunder long-term contracts with the producers in the peakseason -- the four winter months when gas is in heavy demandfor heating. That price dropped to $1.20 per thousand cubicfeet in the low season. Both prices are 40 cents below thosepaid by the utility in the current contract year.</LP><TEXT>   Several producers and industry analysts had expected therejection of what they saw as a &quot;low-ball&quot; offer by theCalifornia buyers.   &quot;It's just too much of a hit all at once,&quot; said RickHillary, a natural gas industry consultant in Calgary.   While spot market prices -- the cost of gas for short-termdelivery -- have fallen substantially to $1 per thousandcubic feet or less, prices for gas delivered under long-termcontracts with extensive reserves behind them have remainedmuch more stable, Mr. Hillary said.   &quot;To price next year's winter supplies on the basis oftoday's distressed sales is a mistake,&quot; he said. &quot;This voteis an indication that Alberta andamp; Southern isn't dealing with acaptive group of producers here.&quot;   California has been one of the best markets for Canadiannatural gas in recent years. About 50% of Pacific Gas's needsare filled by gas from Canada, and the utility has had avirtual monopoly in its Northern California service area,minimizing downward pressure on prices from competitivesources of gas.   In recent months, the California Public UtilitiesCommission has begun attempts to open up the Pacific Gasmarket area. The regulators are attempting to lower the gasprices to customers by allowing some to buy from producersdirectly, and by promoting alternative sources of supply. TheCPUC also must approve the gas prices agreed to by PacificGas and other utilities in negotiations with producers.   &quot;There's no question but that we're concerned about whatthe CPUC is doing,&quot; said Susan Evans, vice president ofcorporate affairs of Encor Inc., a Calgary-based producer.&quot;There were commitments {on the size of the market} made tous when the contracts were signed {in 1988} on which we madeour plans. Effectively, they seem to want to abrogate thosecontracts.&quot; The contract was originally set to expire in1994, but was extended to 2004, with prices to be setannually.   &quot;This price proposal was quite unrealistic,&quot; Ms. Evanssaid. &quot;Nobody really expected this to succeed. We'll just seewhat they come up with next.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
