Ligachevhas told Communist Party leaders their honor as well as his own hadbeen hurt by a prominent prosecutor's accusations of corruption,Tass reported today.   Ligachev accused prosecutor Nikolai Ivanov of ``provocation andmalicious invention'' for saying on national television on May 12that Ligachev's name had come up in a bribery case.   ``Slanderous accusations of this kind affect not only my ownhonor and dignity but also the honor and prestige of the partyPolitburo,'' Ligachev told a meeting of the party's policy-makingCentral Committee on Monday, Tass said.   Ivanov also said his investigations had touched on two formerPolitburo members, Mikhail Solomentsev and Grigory Romanov. Bothretired after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985.   The Central Committee was meeting to discuss Thursday'sinaugural session of the new Congress of People's Deputies, whichwill elect the president from among its ranks as wekk as a smaller,more active Supreme Soviet legislature.   The 251-member committee endorsed Gorbachev for re-election aspresident. Ligachev and Ivanov were elected to the new congress.   Ivanov also has said he would do his best to see that theconservative Ligachev, a potential Gorbachev opponent, would not beelected to the Supreme Soviet, which will hold much of thecongress' legislative power.   Ligachev said Ivanov was trying to discredit the partyleadership and further his own political career.   He called on the Politburo to investigate media abuses connectedwith leaks from prosecutors.   Some publications have given investigators ``broad opportunitiesfor defaming people, accusing them well before trial of crimes,thus deluding millions of people,'' he told the Central Committee.   Ivanov said at a mass meeting held in Moscow on Sunday that theparty apparatus must give up its hold on power. He has notdisclosed further details of the bribery case.   Ivanov and his boss, Telman Gdlyan, are themselves beinginvestigated on alleged abuses of power connected with theirhigh-level corruption cases.   A separate investigation by the Supreme Court has determinedthat in 1983 Gdlyan helped convict an innocent man in Estonia wholater died in prison. The Court has asked the national prosecutor'soffice to consider dismissing Gdlyan as a result.   Gdlyan also is a member of the new congress.   He and Ivanov won fame for an Uzbekistan bribery case that sentYuri Churbanov, son-in-law of late leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, toprison for 12 years.</TEXT></DOC>
