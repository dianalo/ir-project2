The agency alsonotes that the filing notice did not designate a minimum molecular weightof 200 for <T2>andCx.20;</T2>-lauroyl-V-hydroxypoly(oxyethylene). This designation isbeing added in this final rule to better identify this additive.FDA has reviewed the safety of the two remaining additives and the startingmaterials used to manufacture these additives, as well as the byproductsassociated with the manufacturing process. Although the additives themselveshave not been found to cause cancer, they have been found to contain minuteamounts of unreacted ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane as byproduct impuritieswhich are carried through the reaction process. Ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxanehave been shown to cause cancer in test animals. Residual amounts of reactantsand manufacturing aids, such as these chemicals, are commonly found ascontaminants in chemical products including food additives.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Determination of Safety</ITAG>Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(the act) 21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called ``general safety clause''of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular useunless a fair evaluation of the data establishes that the additive is safefor that use. The concept of safety embodied in the Food Additives Amendmentof 1958 is explained in the legislative history of the provision: ``Safetyrequires proof of a reasonable certainty that no harm will result fromthe proposed use of an additive. It does not_and cannot_require proof beyondany possible doubt that no harm will result under any conceivable circumstances.''(H. Rept. 2284, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1958).) This definition of safetyhas been incorporated into FDA's food additive regulations (21 CFR 170.3(i)).The anticancer of Delaney clause of the Food Additives Amendment (section409(c)(3)(A) of the act) provides further that no food additive shall bedeemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by manor animal.In the past, FDA has refused to approve a use of an additive that containedor was suspected of containing even minor amounts of a carcinogenic chemical,even though the additive as a whole had not been shown to cause cancer.The agency now believes, however, that developments in scientific technologyand experience with risk assessment procedures make it possible for FDAto establish the safety of additives that contain carcinogenic chemicalsbut that have not themselves been shown to cause cancer.In the preamble to the final rule permanently listing Dandamp;C Green No.6, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 2, 1982 (47 FR 14138), FDA explainedthe basis for approving the use of a color additive that had not been shownto cause cancer, even though it contains a carcinogenic constituent. Sincethat decision, FDA has approved the use of other color additives and foodadditives on the same basis.An additive that has not been shown to cause cancer, but that containscarcinogenic impurities may properly be evaluated under the general safetyclause of the statute using risk assessment procedures to determine whetherthere is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposeduse of the additive.The agency's position is supported by <T3>Scott </T3>v. <T3>FDA</T3>, 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984). That case involved a challengeto FDA's decision to approve the use of Dandamp;C Green No. 5, which containsa carcinogenic chemical but has itself not been shown to cause cancer.Relying heavily on the reasoning in the agency's decision to list thiscolor additive, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitrejected the challenge to FDA's action and affirmed the listing regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Safety of Petitioned Use</ITAG>The agency estimated the daily intake of the petitioned use of the additives,a-butyl-V-hydroxypoly(oxyethylene) poly(oxypropylene), minimum molecularweight 1,000, and a-lauroyl-V-hydroxypoly(oxyethylene), minimum molecularweight of 200 (common name_polyethylene glycol-200 monolaurate), on thebasis of several factors, including projected migration of the additivesunder the most severe conditions of use and the probable concentrationof the additives in the daily diet from food-contact articles. The agencyestimated that the daily intake of the two additives would be 0.18 milligramper person per day and 0.033 milligram per person per day, respectively.FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic testing to be necessary to determinethe safety of an additive whose use will result in such low exposure level(Refs. 1 and 2), and the agency has not required such testing here. However,the agency has reviewed available acute oral toxicity studies on a-lauroyl-V-hydroxypoly(oxyethylene)and acute oral toxicity studies and subchronic studies in the rat and dogon a-butyl-V-hydroxypoly(oxyethylene)poly (oxyprophylene). No adverse effectswere reported in these studies.Because these two additives have not been shown to cause cancer, the anticancerclause does not apply to them. However, FDA has evaluted the safety ofthese additives under the general safety clause, considering all availabledata and using risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper bound limitof risk presented by the carcinogenic chemicals ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxanethat may be present as impurities in the additives. Based on this evaluation,the agency has concluded that the additives are safe under the proposedconditions of use.The risk assessment procedures that FDA used in this evaluation are similarto the methods that the agency has used to examine the risk associatedwith the presence of minor carcinogenic impurities in various other foodand color additives that contain carcinogenic impurities (e.g., 49 FR 13018,13019; April 2, 1984). This risk evaluation of the carcinogenic impuritieshas two aspects: (1) Assessment of the worst-case exposure to the impuritiesfrom the proposed use of the additive; and (2) extrapolation of the riskobserved in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable exposureto humans.A. 1,4-Dioxane Based on the fraction of the daily diet that may be in contact with surfacescontaining the additives, and assuming that 1,4-dioxane is present at thelimit of detection in the additives (Ref. 3), FDA estimated the hypotheticalworst case exposure to 1,4-dioxane from the use of these two additivesto be 2.1 nanograms per person per day. The agency used data from a carcinogenesisbioassay on 1,4-dioxane conducted for the National Cancer Institute (Ref.4) to estimate the upper bound level of lifetime human risk from the proposeduse of the additives. The results of the bioassay on 1,4-dioxane indicatedthat the material was carcinogenic for female rats under the conditionsof the study. The test material caused significantly increased incidenceof squamous cell carcinomas and hepatocellular tumors in female rats. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition's Cancer Assessment Committee(the committee) reviewed this bioassay and other relevant data availablein the literature and concluded that the findings of carcinogenicity weresupported by this information on 1,4-dioxane. The committee further concludedthat an upper bound level of lifetime risk from potential exposure to 1,4-dioxanestemming from the proposed use of these two additives could be calculatedfrom the bioassay. The agency used a quantitative risk assessment procedure (linear proportionalmodel) to extrapolate from the dose used in the animal experiment to thevery low doses encountered under the proposed conditions of use. This procedureis not likely to underestimate the actual risk from very low doses andmay, in fact, exaggerate it because the extrapolation models used are designedto estimate the maximum risk consistent with the data. For this reason,the estimate can be used with confidence to determine to a reasonable certaintywhether any harm will result from the proposed conditions and levels ofuse of the food additives. Based on a worst case exposure of 2.1 nanograms per person per day, FDAestimates that the upper bound limit of individual lifetime risk from thepotential exposure to 1,4-dioxane from the use of these two additives is8andmultiply;10^11 or less than 1 in 12 billion (Ref. 5). Because of numerousconservatisms in the exposure estimate, lifetime averaged individual exposureto 1,4-dioxane is expected to be substantially less than the estimateddaily intake, and, therefore, the calculated upper bound limit of riskwould be less. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certaintyof no harm from the exposure to 1,4-dioxane that might result from theproposed use of the additive. B. Ethylene Oxide Based on the fraction of the daily diet that may be in contact with surfacescontaining the additives and assuming that ethylene oxide is present atthe limit of detection in the additives (Ref. 3), FDA estimated the hypotheticalworst case exposure to ethylene oxide from the use of these two additivesto be 1.8 nanograms per person per day. The agency used data from a carcinogenesisbioassay on ethylene oxide conducted by the Institute of Hygiene, Universityof Mainz, Federal Republic of Germany (Ref. 6) to estimate the upper boundlevel of lifetime human risk from the proposed use of the additives. Theresults of the bioassay on ethylene oxide indicated that the material wascarcinogenic for female rats under the conditions of the study. The testmaterial caused significantly increased incidence of squamous cell carcinomaof the forestomach and carcinoma in situ of the glandular stomach. The committee reviewed this bioassay and other relevant data availablein the literature and concluded that the findings of carcinogenicity weresupported by this information on ethylene oxide. The committee furtherconcluded that an upper bound level of human risk from potential exposureto ethylene oxide stemming from the proposed use of these two additivescould be calculated from the bioassay. Based on a worst case exposure of 1.8 nanograms per person per day, FDAestimates that the upper bound limit of individual lifetime risk from thepotential exposure to ethylene oxide from the use of these two additivesis 3andmultiply;10^9 or less than 1 in 330 million (Ref. 5). Because of numerousconservatisms in the exposure estimate, lifetime averaged individual exposureto ethylene oxide is expected to be substantially less than the estimateddaily intake, and, therefore, the calculated upper bound limit of riskwould be less. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certaintyof no harm from the exposure to ethylene oxide that might result from theproposed use of these two additives. C. Need for Specifications The agency has also considered whether specifications are necessary tocontrol the amount of ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane in the additives.The agency finds that specifications are not necessary for the followingreasons: (1) Because of the low levels at which ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxanemay be expected to remain as impurities following production of the additives,the agency would not expect these impurities to become components of foodat other than extremely small levels; and (2) the upper bound limit oflifetime risk from exposure to these impurities, even under worst caseassumptions, is very low, less than 1 in 12 billion for 1,4-dioxane andless than 1 in 330 million for ethylene oxide. D. Conclusion on Safety FDA has evaluated the data in the petition and other relevant materialand concludes that the proposed use of these additives in lubricants usedin the production of metallic articles for food-contact is safe, and that21 CFR 178.3910(a)(2) should be amended to provide for the safe use ofa-Buty1-V-hydroxypoly(oxyethylene) poly(oxypropylene) (CAS Reg. No. 9038-95-3)and a-Lauroyl-V-hydroxypoly (oxyethylene) (CAS Reg. No. 9004-81-3).In accordance with andSection;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition andthe documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decisionto approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center forFood Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contactperson listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will deletefrom the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosurebefore making the documents available for inspection. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effectsof this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significantimpact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statementis not required.
