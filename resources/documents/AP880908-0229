WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis told war veteransThursday he does not question George Bush's patriotism but ``Iquestion his priorities,'' and said the massive federal debtthreatens the nation's military strength.   ``Military might cannot be sustained without economic might,''said the Democratic presidential nominee. ``We cannot build astrong national defense on a mountain of debt.''   Dukakis received a polite, sometimes warm reception in anaddress to the annual convention of the American Legion, thenation's largest organization of veterans of war-time militaryservice.   He later flew to Buffalo, N.Y., to tour a General Motors engineplant, then attended a gala fund-raiser in New York City that thecampaign said would raise $5 million for the fall effort.   He shook hands with Jesse Jackson, who told reporters: ``I'mavailable to campaign....upon request of the ticket.''   Dukakis steered clear of mentioning in his speech the strategicweapons systems proposed by the Reagan administration that heopposes _ such as the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles, and theStar Wars nuclear defense system.   In a news conference later, Dukakis said he supports continuedStar Wars research at the reduced level of $1 billion a year butbelieves testing and deployment of such a nuclear-shield systemwould violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which hesupports as in the nation's best interest.   ``If I made the judgment and if Congress made the judgment itwas essential to our national security, then obviously we wouldproceed with it. But we don't know that at this point,'' Dukakissaid.   Dukakis has belittled the program, known as the StrategicDefense Initiative, in his campaign speeches. He has called it a``fantasy'' and said the country needs ``star schools not StarWars,'' while at the same time supporting continued research at1982 levels.   He faced repeated questioning about what appeared to be a changein tone if not position. He said he favored research as a way ``tokeep our options open.''      ``I'm for continued research, but to commit billions that wedon't have ... to a system that is untested, untried and unproven,and which Mr. Bush himself apparently changed positions on a weekago, in my judgment doesn't serve the national interest,'' Dukakissaid. He referred to Bush's recent remarks that suggested he wassoftening support for SDI deployment.   Dukakis followed by a day an appearance before the same group byBush, the vice president and Republican presidential nominee whohas attacked Dukakis as soft on defense for opposing new weaponssystems.      Dukakis, an Army veteran, wore a Legion convention medal on hislapel and a pin commemorating soldiers missing in action _ but didnot wear a legionnaire's cap _ during a speech that was interruptedrepeatedly by applause.   He critized the Reagan administration for misspending somedefense money on weapons system that don't work and attacked theadministration and Bush for supporting cuts in veterans benefits,including cuts in the Veterans Administration hospital system.      ``My opponent in this election is a patriotic man who served hiscountry well in time of war,'' Dukakis said. ``I do not questionhis love for this country. But there are days _ and this is one ofthem _ when I question his priorities.''      Bush used similar words before the Legion, saying he did notquestion Dukakis' patriotism but his support for a strong defense.      Dukakis said Bush supports a capital gains tax break that wouldbenefit the wealthy, and compared that position with what he saidwas Bush's vote to break a Senate tie to cut VA health carebenefits by $2 billion and to eliminate cost of living increasesfor disabled veterans.      ``What kind of priorities are those? A tax cut for those whohave it made. A cut in income for those who lost a leg at Normandyor were blinded at Inchon or had an arm torn off at Khe Sanh,'' hesaid.      Dukakis praised the U.S.-Soviet treaty reducingintermediate-range nuclear missiles and said, ``I salute PresidentReagan for it.'' But he said the country should strengthenconventional forces while working to ``build on that treaty.''   ``We cannot rest here because today, after eight years and $2trillion, we still don't have an anti-tank weapon that can stopmodern Soviet tanks. We have serious shortages in ammunition andspare parts and maintenance. We see billions being spent on weaponsthat don't do what they are designed to do. And we see too manydefense dollars slipping into the pockets of wheeler dealers andconsultants,'' he said.   At his news conference, Dukakis made light of Bush'smisstatement before the Legion group that Sept. 7 was theanniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The attack wason Dec. 7, 1941.   ``I didn't know there were only 16 shopping days to Christmasuntil yesterday,'' Dukakis said.   He shrugged off a question about the latest poll showing himeight points down, and the suggestion his campaign is in disarray.``I don't think we're slipping and I don't think we're indisarray,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
