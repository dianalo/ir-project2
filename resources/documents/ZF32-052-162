The line also uses Intel's Flash-basedBIOS system, which is also upgradable.andP;  The three models of the486D come with 4Mbytes of memory, expandable to 64Mbytes, andeither a 1.2Mbyte- or 1.44Mbyte floppy drive.andP;  They also includean 80Mbyte hard drive and monochrome monitor, which can beupgraded to color for an additional $200.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Dell Computer Corp.
