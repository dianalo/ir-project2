TaylorStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ENVIRONMENT (ENV)ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Environmental Protection Agency chief Lee Thomas said he &quot;probably&quot; will have to impose curbs on industrial growth in several areas that haven't shown they can meet the federal ozone standard.    Mr. Thomas told the House subcommittee on Health and the Environment that he will decide in the next few months whether to impose sanctions on cities that are flunking the important air pollution standard.    He said the law gives him &quot;limited flexibility&quot; in dealing with areas that never have developed federally approved plans to meet the standard. For such areas, he warned, he is &quot;probably going to have to impose sanctions&quot; in the form of curbs on construction of large, polluting plants.    Cities that lack approved plans and that are unlikely to win approval by the end of the year are Los Angeles; Chicago; Sacramento, Calif.; Fresno, Calif.; Atlanta; Dallas-Fort Worth, and Phoenix, Ariz. Also needing approval but likely to get it this year, according to the EPA, are, among others, Cincinnati; Bakersfield, Calif.; Baton Rouge, La.; El Paso, Texas, and Memphis, Tenn.    The EPA administrator said he has more discretion over whether to impose sanctions on areas that drag their feet in implementing plans or tightening those that prove inadequate. For such areas, which Mr. Thomas didn't identify, he could impose construction curbs or withhold federal aid for air pollution programs, highways and sewer projects. He said he is prepared to use any of these sanctions under certain circumstances.    The testimony came as, separately, an internal EPA report concluded that air pollution continues to pose higher risks to people than many other environmental hazards. The same report suggested that the agency spends too much on hazardous-waste problems and not enough on some other environmental hazards.    The testimony was the closest Mr. Thomas has come to predicting imposition of so-called construction bans for areas plagued by ozone, the nation's most troublesome air pollutant. The environmental agency calculates that more than 70 areas probably will fail to meet the federal ozone standard by this year's statutory deadline, and that about 20 of them aren't likely to comply for 20 years or more.    Mr. Thomas surprised many lawmakers by saying he may propose some construction bans &quot;within the next several months.&quot; Officially, the statutory deadline for compliance with federal pollution standards is Dec. 31. But EPA officials said they will be able to determine whether various areas meet the standards earlier than that, because the assessment is based on pollution averages over the past three years.    The construction bans would affect only plans to build large plants that would emit the volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxides that react to form ozone on warm, sunny days. Many areas have found loopholes in the bans. Some, for example, have issued permits to build many facilities before a ban could take effect.    Still, local officials and many lawmakers view possible bans as a serious threat. Rep. Norman Lent (R., N.Y.) said the statutory requirement for construction bans puts Congress &quot;in sort of a hole. We've got to dig out of it, otherwise the whole country will grind to a halt.&quot;    Noting that ozone can cause lung damage and reduce resistance to infection, Mr. Thomas said he wouldn't recommend relaxing the standard. But he urged Congress to reconsider the sanctions mandate and to defer the compliance deadline to different dates for different cities.    The internal EPA study on environmental risks, first reported in the New York Times, is based on subjective judgments by 75 top agency staff members. They said there are relatively low public or environmental risks from mismanagement of hazardous waste or from leaking toxic-waste dumps and underground gasoline or chemical tanks. Those problems are addressed in the five-year, $9 billion Superfund law that was enacted last year with strong popular support.    The report ranked the following as relatively high risks that currently draw low EPA effort: radon and other indoor air pollutants; contaminants that wash off farms and cities in rainwater; accidental releases from chemical plants; pesticide residues in food, and worker exposure to pesticides and other toxic materials. The report also put in the high-risk, low-effort category the unproven theories that manmade chemicals are depleting the stratospheric ozone level and causing a rise in global temperatures.    The EPA currently is addressing the apparent mismatch of resources in two areas. It is increasing its regulation of pesticides and launching a new program to help states regulate rain runoff.    The report noted that the agency's current priorities are influenced by laws, public demands and feasibility of controls. Current spending patterns, it said, &quot;appear more closely aligned with public opinion than with our estimated risks.&quot;    Mr. Thomas requested the study to &quot;spark a discussion of where to put our money&quot; in the future, according to an EPA spokesman. </TEXT></DOC>
