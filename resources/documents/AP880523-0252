Lucky, the nation's sixth-largest supermarket chain, has agreedto be acquired by American, the third-largest, in a buyout valuedat about $2.5 billion cash, or $65 a share.   The merger would create the nation's biggest grocery store chain.   The agreement announced Friday terminated Lucky's April 28 dealto go private in a leveraged buyout led by the New York firmGibbons, Green van Amerongen Ltd. for $2.35 billion in cash andstock.   It also gives American Stores, based in Salt Lake City, a chanceto take advantage of the management expertise and longstandingidentity as a low-price leader that analysts say have been amongLucky's most valuable assets.   ``American Stores has always considered Lucky to be the leadingsupermarket chain in California and is enthusiastic about thecombination of our Alpha Beta (grocery store) operations with thoseof Lucky,'' American Stores Chairman L.S. Skaggs said in announcingthe buyout.   Analysts widely had speculated that if American Stores succeededin acquiring Dublin, Calif.-based Lucky, it would merge the companywith its weaker Alpha Beta chain in California.   Lucky Stores has 480 stores and had $6.4 billion in 1987 sales.American Stores has 1,600 stores and $14.1 billion in sales.   Lucky also was seen as a desirable takeover target because of arestructuring prompted by an unsuccessful takeover attempt lastyear by New York investor Asher B. Edelman.   The company sold off its non-grocery divisions, plus stores inArizona and Florida under the restructuring, and paid $2.8 millionof Edelman's legal costs in return for his dropping the hostile bid.   While the $65 a share price being paid for Lucky was consideredhigh by some analysts, American Stores might justify the costthrough the efficiencies of combined operations, industry expertssaid.   To break off its buyout agreement with Gibbons, Green, LuckyStores agreed to pay the firm a $20 million fee plus expenses.   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Luckyclosed unchanged at $64.37{ Friday while American Stores fell $1 to$53.25.   The offer from American Stores is subject to a majority ofLucky's 38.6 million shares being tendered. American Stores said ithad written commitments from commercial banks for all financingrequired.   The American Stores offer expires at midnight EDT June 1.   Lucky shares not purchased by American Stores in the tenderoffer will be converted into the right to receive $65 in cash in asubsequent merger between Lucky and a subsidiary of American.   American Stores had raised its bid for Lucky to $65 a share lastTuesday.   Gibbons, Green's latest offer was for a leveraged buyout thatwould pay $61 a share in cash for about 92 percent of Lucky'soutstanding shares. Gibbons, Green would also have issued preferredshares valued at $7 a share for the remaining shares.   American Stores' second bid followed the disclosure ofconfidential information by Lucky to American, under thestipulation that American would either sweeten its offer or end itshostile bid.   American Stores initiated the bidding with a $45-a-share tenderoffer that Lucky rejected as inadeauate in March, as it did a lateroffer of a negotiated acquisition at $50 a share.</TEXT></DOC>
