Hubbard, the newly elected chairman and chiefexecutive officer of Hollywood Park Operating, called onholders and racing fans to look past the proxy fight, whichled to the ouster of Marjorie L. Everett, who had run thecompany for nearly 20 years. &quot;We're not going to worry aboutthe past,&quot; he said. &quot;There is nothing we can do about thepast.&quot;   Mrs. Everett did not attend the meeting. In an unemotionalletter read by one of her attorneys, Mrs. Everett reiteratedher stance that she wouldn't accept the new board's offer fora $12,500-a-month severance. And she called for any proxymaterials that may have given a false impression that she wasa party to any settlement to be amended accordingly.   One shareholder called for a round of applause for Mrs.Everett; the response was tepid.   Mr. Hubbard, a major track and horse owner and Texasglassmaking tycoon, was peppered with questions about hisplans for the racetrack, once viewed as the premierthoroughbred park in the country. He said he would implementa five-phase improvement strategy to increase attendance, thefirst part of which will cost about $2 million and primarilyinvolve landscaping and other renovations.
