Theenergy policy of the western industrial countries has been adapting tothe situation by economics, energy conservation and nuclear power whichsince the beginning of the second oil crisis have been reducing the annualOECD petroleum consumption by 400 million tons equivalent to 20 per centof 1978 petroleum consumption. The contribution of nuclear power to electricpower generation through 2000 is equivalent to approximately 10 per centof the world crude oil reserves which at present are assumed to be available.The paper deals with the relation between the development of the populationand primary energy consumption, with aspects of electric power generationas well as with the situation concerning resources and the contributionof nuclear power to energy supplies.</TEXT></DOC>
