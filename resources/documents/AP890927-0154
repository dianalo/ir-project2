The statements by Gen. John Piotrowski, commander-in-chief ofthe North American Aerospace Defense Command, known as NORAD, comesa day after the Senate voted down a measure to add $300 million tothe Star Wars program, formally called the Strategic DefenseInitiative.   ``We didn't develop those (anti-satellite) spacecraft for war,''the general said, adding that U.S. programs are for ``earlywarning'' of a possible attack. The Soviet space weaponry, however,``gives them the type of military capability one would like tohave.''   Piotrowski made his remarks at a seminar sponsored by theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science.   Painting the U.S. space programs as defensive and those by theSoviets as offensive, Piotrowski made no mention of advances madeby the superpowers last weekend during talks in Wyoming. TheSoviets pulled back an earlier demand to link long-range strategicarms talks on U.S. curbs on the Star Wars program.   Kent Stansberry, the Defense Department's director of defenseand space arms policy, said previously scheduled negotiationsbetween the United States and the Soviets will resume Friday inGeneva to work toward a Stragegic Arms Reduction Treaty. Anagreement would cut long-range strategic arms by up to 50 percent.   The Soviet agreement not to link the treaty with limits on theU.S. Star Wars program ended a four-year deadlock.   Stansberry cautioned, however, that the Soviet Union could tryagain to put conditions on future arms talks.   Piotrowski said the United States was ill-prepared to deal withthe Soviets in the event they used weapons against Americansatellites.   ``Would they shoot down a mechanical device in space that was athreat to security? You bet they would,'' the general said. ``Whatwould we do?''   Congress has banned antisatellite tests against objects inspace. Earlier this year, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney calledthe lack of space testing for antisatellite weapons the ``singlemost vulnerable point'' in U.S. defenses.   In recent years, Piotrowski said, the United States detected andtracked about 1,700 missiles launched by the Soviets and othernations, and needed the ability to track them to assure they didnot pose a threat.   ``I'm convinced ... we need an anti-satellite weapon to protectour troops and respond in kind,'' the general said.   The Star Wars program and the anti-satellite weapons have beensources of controversy for years. President Reagan first proposedthe space programs in 1983, and his aides said the Star Warsdefense shield would include several hundred large orbitingplatforms equipped with killer rockets and hundreds of supportingsurveillance and tracking satellites.   Lawmakers have argued that some of the testing would violate the1972 Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty between the United States andthe Soviet Union.   Congress on Tuesday voted down a Republican effort to restorefunds to Star Wars to a level closer to the $4.5 billion approvedby the Senate in its authorization bill last month.</TEXT></DOC>
