Whenever poisonous, explosive or otherwise dangerous substancesare released into the nation's waters, telephones start ringing atthe Hazardous Materials Response Branch.   ``We are by far and away the most experienced group in oil spillresponse worldwide. No question,'' said Dave Kennedy, chief ofscientific support coordinators at the war room, which is theWestern regional headquarters of the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration.   As fires raged aboard the Mega Borg off Texas on Saturday, theresearch unit was already providing cleanup and Coast Guard crewswith vital data predicting the course and effects of a slick fromthe Norwegian supertanker.   Two oceanographer-modelers were sent to Galveston to studycurrents and meteorological factors; three experts from Columbia,S.C., assessed hazards to seafood, beachgoers and shipping, and twoLouisiana State University chemists analyzed the makeup of thevessel's cargo of light crude.   Tomes of information were being sifted by two informationmanagement specialists. And a media specialist was sent toGalveston on Tuesday to field questions from reporters.   Before the research unit was formed 14 years ago, the CoastGuard and cleanup contractors were deluged with raw information``and in many cases had no idea how to interpret it,'' Kennedy said.   ``We're here basically to provide a formal mechanism fortransferring scientific information to the operational responseguys, the Coast Guard.''   The hazardous-response team must answer a vast array ofquestions:   _ Where would oil go if the vessel broke apart or sank? How muchwould drift to the bottom? How much would stay at the surface? Howmuch would be carried by currents beneath the surface?   _ What threat would the oil pose to shrimp, oysters, mussels andfish? What would be the best way to minimize the damage? Wouldcontainment booms do any good? If so, where should they be placed?   _ How much air pollution has occurred? What is the danger toCorpus Christi, Galveston and other populated areas along the coast?   _ What should be done about shipping traffic in the area?   While the threat of a catastrophic spill receded today, theresearch unit still had plenty on its mind, including spills in theArthur Kill waterway between New York and New Jersey, Buzzards Bayin Massachusetts and the Connecticut River in Connecticut.   The Seattle control room is equipped with nautical charts andtopographic maps for every coastline and major inland waterway.There's a large map on one wall dotted with markings for offshoreoil and gas drilling rigs, weather monitoring platforms and buoys,the latest location of the burning ship and the outer limits of theslick.   On a nearby bookshelf is an atlas listing shellfish and wetlandareas, industrial and shipping sites, bathing beaches and othershoreline assets.   ``This is what we call our war room,'' Kennedy said.   ``I worked about 18 hours yesterday. You worked, what, about 24hours?'' he said to a woman poring over computer printouts.   The unit has grown from 10 people in 1976 to 60 today, includingabout 35 specialists ready to fly out at any moment and eightregional coordinators stationed around the country.   Practically every available staffer was assigned to PrinceWilliam Sound after the Exxon Valdez tanker hit a reef and spillednearly 11 million gallons of heavy crude oil in 1989, Kennedy said.About eight staffers are still monitoring the cleanup.   ``This spill is not on a level of intensity with the ExxonValdez,'' Kennedy said. But his team learned from that disaster toanticipate the worst.   ``We all said, `The weather is good, the currents aren't toobad, we ought to be able to keep the oil from reaching shore,''' hesaid. ``Then we had a windstorm come up and drive the oil not justto the shore but far beyond where the tide would normally reach.''   ``We've gotten more skeptical.''</TEXT></DOC>
