Bargainers worked until after 11 p.m., alternatively thrashingout the details behind closed doors in a Capitol office, andshopping around parts of the tentative deal to their colleagues.   Sources said the participants had reached a consensus, but didnot completely rule out a last-minute snag before presenting it toPresident Bush at a White House meeting set for Friday morning.   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., told reporters asThursday's session ended that the negotiators would reconvene inthe morning shortly before the session with Bush.   ``I'm fairly optimistic we'll have something,'' he said.   ``It's likely there will be agreement sometime prior to'' theWhite House meeting, said Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, rankingRepublican on the House Budget Committee. ``In fact I'd say I'malmost certain.''   The month-long talks have been aimed at reaching agreement on aplan that would slice the deficit for the fiscal year beginningOct. 1 to $100 billion, as required by the Gramm-Rudman balancedbudget law.   Because the Bush administration and congressional leaders haveagreed to use optimistic economic projections, they have said theycan hit the target by agreeing to $28 billion worth of savings.   The fiscal 1989 deficit is expected to exceed $170 billion, andmany economists and others believe that the budget negotiatorswould have to find billions of dollars more in savings if they usedmore realistic assumptions. The optimistic projections negate theneed for even tougher savings decisions.   Negotiators have been discussing splitting the savings evenlybetween spending reductions and new revenues.   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing Waysand Means Committee, confirmed Thursday that the bargainers hadagreed to pick up $5.3 billion in additional taxes.   Bush has insisted often that he will live up to his campaignpledge of opposing what he calls ``new taxes.'' The agreement _which leaves the decisions on the types of taxes for later _ allowsBush to claim he has honored that promise.   Bush favors raising $4.8 billion by cutting capital gains taxes,which he says would prod the economy. Democrats oppose the idea.   The rest of the revenue would come from selling federal assetsand raising fees the government charges for certain services.   On the spending side, about half the savings would come fromrestraining the projected growth in benefit programs that areautomatically paid to recipients, such as the Medicare healthprogram for the elderly and disabled.   Negotiators have discussed gimmicks, such as claiming up to $2billion in savings by moving the U.S. Postal Service``off-budget,'' and close to $1 billion by shifting some farmsubsidy payments planned for 1990 into this year.   Even if an agreement is announced, Congress will have to enact abudget resolution reflecting the pact. The legal deadline for thatresolution is April 15, and as usual lawmakers will miss it by atleast several weeks. Spending and tax legislation reflecting thebudget's strictures then follows.</TEXT></DOC>
