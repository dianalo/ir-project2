The regulatory action, which will end the manufacture of mostasbestos products in three phases over the next seven years, wasexpected to be announced by the Environmental Protection Agencytoday.   According to government and private sources who spoke oncondition they not be identified, the agency action will allowasbestos to be a component in only a small number of items,prohibiting its use over the next seven years in an estimated 94percent of the products in which it currently can be found.   Among those products are automobile brake pads and linings,cement water distribution pipes, roofing shingles, floor and pipewrapping and other construction products.</TEXT><DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Longtime leader Janos Kadar, who rose topower after the Soviets crushed the 1956 revolt and steered Hungarythrough relative prosperity until hard times and liberals forced himout, died today at age 77.

The newly recognized illness, which doctors call streptococcaltoxic shock syndrome, can lead from a minor skin infection to deathin a day or two.   Strep germs are common but usually result in relatively minorillnesses, such as sore throats. More virulent forms of the microbeswere once frequent causes of life-threatening illnesses, includingscarlet fever and rheumatic fever. But for reasons unclear, thedangerous strains of strep largely faded away in the early 1940s.   In today's New England Journal of Medicine, doctors describe 20cases of severe illness, including six deaths, that were seenbetween 1986 and 1988 in Idaho, Montana, Utah and Nevada. Theybelieve the illness was caused by strep bacteria that producescarlatina toxin, the poison responsible for scarlet fever.</TEXT><DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Neptune's poles may be encircled by broadbands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on Earth andJupiter, say scientists studying a new photograph from the Voyager 2space probe.   Two dark bands, each about 2,700 miles wide, are clearly visibleforming a collar around Neptune's south pole. The photograph alsoshows hints of similar banding around the north pole, said EdwardStone, Voyager project scientist for NASA's Jet PropulsionLaboratory.   ``They are probably regions of clouds associated with high-speedjet streams,'' said Stone, a physicist and vice president at theCalifornia Institute of Technology.   The planet's southern hemisphere bands stretch from 50 degreessouth latitude to 70 degrees south latitude, said Candice Hansen, aplanetary scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</TEXT></DOC>
