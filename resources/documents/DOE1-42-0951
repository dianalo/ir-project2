Visible injuryto the plant was ascertained with fumigation treatments of relativelyhigh concentrations of sulfur dioxide. The inhibitory effects of sulfurdioxide on the photosynthetic activity were examined to clarify the mechanismof the effects. Also, the sulfur dioxide uptake of leaves was testedunder different conditions of light, air temperature and wind velocity.Finally, the effects of invisible injury of sulfur dioxide on the successivegrowth of dry weight were tested.</TEXT></DOC>
