Menendez, the special attorney general for human rights, said hewould take the accord to the capital, 15 miles west of the prison,for the signature of Interior Minister Roberto Valle Valdizan, thenreturn to the prison.   He said he expected a the agreement would be signed by bothsides today.   Red Cross officials were reportedly preparing to evacuate thecivilians inside the prison once the accord was signed.   The government offered late Wednesday to replace the warden andall the guards at the 1,350-inmate Pavon prison farm if the rebelssurrendered. the warden and the guards if the mutineers surrender.   Between 75 and 100 rebel inmates armed with M-1 rifles have beenin control of the prison, Guatemala's largest, since Sunday. Atleast four guards and three inmates died in the Easter revolt.   About 600 people _ mostly women and children _ were visitingwhen the uprising began. Some stayed inside with the inmates, andauthorities differed on whether they were hostages or whether theystayed to protect their loved ones from security force reprisals.   The government said it would consider the rebels' request forpardons for crimes committed during the uprising and guaranteetheir physical safety once they surrendered their arms and theroughly 500 people with them.   About 110 prisoners who took no part in the revolt fledWednesday from the section that remained under inmate control andwere taken into custody.   Twenty relatives of inmates trapped inside when the uprisingstarted began also made their way out.   In its Wednesday offer, the government also promised to promote``strict application'' of a law providing for reduction ofsentences through work and present to Congress the mutineers'demand for a nationwide reduction of all prison sentences by fiveyears.   Any pardon or amnesty for crimes committed during the rebellionwould have to be enacted by Congress.   However, Edmundo Vasquez Martinez, president of the SupremeCourt, said Wednesday that the court could not grant pardons forcrimes committed at Pavon.   The inmates offered to surrender if the warden and guards werereplaced at Pavon, which is about 15 miles east of Guatemala City,negotiator Julio Escobar Arango said.   About 100 black-helmeted military police arrived Wednesday toreinforce the 1,000 police and army troopers ringing the prison.President Vinicio Cerezo has said force would not be used unlessprisoners try to shoot their way out.   The rebels were described as hardened criminals serving longsentences for crimes such as murder and kidnapping. They reportedlyinclude former security forces members.</TEXT></DOC>
