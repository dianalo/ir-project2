The department's Agricultural Research Service reported that twoenzymes in corn and other plants help limit stress from heat anddrought ``within a temperature range we call a thermal kineticwindow.''   Researchers said that when the plant's temperature rises abovethe window, its ability to fight heat stress starts to fade. Andwhen there is a lack of water for use by the plant's naturalcooling system, the enzymes become less effective and the plantwithers and dies.   The enzymes identified by agency scientists in Lubbock, Texas,are glutathione reductase, which stops the buildup of potentiallylethal waste products as a plant fights heat stress, andhydroxypyruvate reductase, which is thought to protectphotosynthesis, or the plant's food-making process, during stress.   Jerry L. Hatfield, a research leader at the laboratory, saidthermal kinetic windows vary by plant species and are much narrowerthan expected. For example, corn has a window in a range of 77 to88 degrees Fahrenheit; cucumbers, 93 to 100; wheat, 62 to 73;spinach, 50 to 63; and cotton 73 to 90.   One of the goals of the research is to transfer one plant'sgenes for controlling an enzyme's behavior into other plants,thereby producing crops that are more tolerant to heat, drought andother stresses than they otherwise would be, Hatfield said in areport issued here.   ``Although such advances may be a long way off, they could leadto crops better equipped to face such climatic changes as thegradual heating that may occur from the buildup of carbon dioxidein the earth's atmosphere,'' he said.   Meanwhile, a report by the government's Joint AgriculturalWeather Facility said rain and cooler weather in the week of June27 to July 3 ``eased drought stress in the Great Plains, Delta andwestern Corn Belt'' but that ``the lack of moisture worsened inmost Corn Belt states.''   Overall, the corn crop was in ``still mostly fair-to-poor''condition, the report said.   An estimated 96 percent of the nation's soybeans had beenplanted by July 3, slightly behind the normal pace. The crop wasreported in ``mostly fair'' condition in the Great Plains andSoutheast but were said to be ``mostly poor'' in the Delta states.   ``Cooler temperatures eased livestock stress,'' the report said.``Ranchers continued culling herds as forage supplies decreased.Producers provided supplemental feed in most areas. Pastures weremostly poor and showed very little regrowth.''</TEXT></DOC>
