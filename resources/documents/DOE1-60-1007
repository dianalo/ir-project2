This paper presents numerical solutionsfor one-dimensional conduction-controlled periodic melting and freezingin a PCM, in the form of a plane slab, one side of which exchanges heatwhile the other side is insulated. The heat transfer surface is alternatelyexposed to temperatures above and below the fusion temperature. Due tothe cyclic change of temperature multiple solid-liquid interfaces developwithin the PCM slab. Periodic melting and freezing experiments were alsocarried out by alternately heating and cooling a horizontal slab of n-octadecanefrom the top. Excellent agreement was obtained between numerical predictionsand experimental results. 5 refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
