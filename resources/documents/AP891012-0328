The agency called leaders of the UAL Corp. buyout group toWashington ``to meet with us and describe the details of theproposed transaction,'' said department spokesman Paul Williams.   The Machinists union, representing more than a third of UAL's70,000 employees, has asked the Labor Department to block thegroup's $6.75 billion buyout of the nation's second-largestairline, contending it is too high-priced and unfair to employees.   In a letter to department officials, the Machinists said theproposed deal violates sections of the Employment Retirement IncomeSecurity Act, which governs use of employee investment funds.   Williams said that after gathering the facts, the departmentwould ``make a judgment under the ERISA as to what, if any problemsexist with the proposed buyout.''   Meanwhile, the United chapter of the Association of FlightAttendants hit what it called a number of major stumbling blocks incontract negotiations aimed at giving the attendants an ownershipstake in UAL. Union spokeswoman Carol Holmes said at least one ofthose hurdles ``may prove to be insurmountable.''   The only unionized employees committed to participating in thebuyout are United's 7,000 pilots, who are leading the takeovergroup that also includes UAL's top management and British AirwaysPLC.   The company's 24,000 non-union workers would automaticallyparticipate in an employee stock ownership plan if the buyout,which has been approved by UAL's board, goes through.   The pilots have said they are prepared to proceed with the$300-a-share deal regardless of whether fellow unions participate.Nonetheless, disunity among the workers has raised questions aboutthe chance of the buyout's long-term success.   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, UAL climbed $3.25 ashare to $285.   The pilots have agreed to accept contract concessions of $250million a year and have voted by a 9-to-1 margin to commit $200million from their $1.2 billion pension fund to buy preferred stockin the employee stock ownership plan.   In a three-page letter delivered Wednesday to Labor SecretaryElizabeth Dole, the Machinists charged that the tax benefits of theproposed buyout ``are effectively subsidizing a substantial andexcessive windfall'' for UAL's management and United's pilots.   The letter, signed by John Peterpaul, executive vice presidentof the Machinists' union, also contended the purchase priceapproved by UAL's board is too high and that the buyout wouldresult in ``significant risk and inefficiency'' caused by ``ongoinglabor strife and disharmony.''   Peterpaul referred calls about the letter to Brian Freeman,financial adviser for the International Association of Machinistsand Aerospace Workers, who did not immediately return telephonecalls.   Labor Department spokesman Paul Williams said agency officialswere meeting to consider the letter.   The pilots had no comment on the letter, said spokeswoman KathieHardin of the Air Line Pilots Association.   The Machinists previously said they opposed the deal because ofthe increased debt it would involve and the uncertain prospects forthe company's continued prosperity.   The deal also is under scrutiny by the TransportationDepartment, which has expressed concern about debt-financed buyoutsand foreign stakes in U.S. airlines.   Ms. Holmes said contract negotiators for the 14,000 Unitedflight attendants have balked at company proposals to increase theattendants' share of their medical costs and to increase the numberof foreign-language-speaking attendants on international flights.   She said the latter proposal would unfairly reduce theinternational flight opportunities for senior attendants who do notspeak a foreign language.   Meanwhile Thursday, AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines,issued a statement saying it had asked the Department ofTransportation ``to make fundamental changes'' in the air serviceagreement between the United States and Great Britain beforeallowing British Airways to participate in the UAL buyout.   AMR, which is weighing a $7 billion takeover offer from DonaldTrump,   said the UAL deal ``represents a unilateral opening of U.S.aviation markets'' and ``it is unsound as a matter of policy, andit is inconsistent with U.S. efforts to attain fair tradingrelationships.''   AMR spokesman Al Becker said the company did not object ingeneral to British Airways participation in the deal, but believesthe U.S. government should require Great Britain to open up itsmarkets to greater access by U.S. carriers.   Becker said American has been stymied in its efforts to open upnon-stop Chicago-London and New York-Manchester routes because``the British government is one of the most restrictive in theworld'' in allowing foreign carriers access to its markets.</TEXT></DOC>
