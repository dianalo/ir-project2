(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA began the countdown today forthis weekend's launch of Discovery on a mission officials hope willget the shuttle program back in motion and help restore the spaceagency's credibility.   The shuttle is scheduled to lift off at 7:35 a.m. EDT Saturdaywith five astronauts and the plutonium-powered Ulysses probe, whichwill explore the sun.   The countdown clock started ticking at 3:30 a.m.   ``We're looking very smooth at this point,'' NASA test directorTerry Willingham said several hours after the countdown began.``Everybody's looking forward to a good launch. It's been a long,dry spell.''   NASA has not launched a shuttle since April because of dangeroushydrogen leaks afflicting Columbia and Atlantis. Discovery is theonly shuttle in which hydrogen leaks have not been found and isalso the last shuttle to have flown.   Discovery's cargo on that last flight - the Hubble SpaceTelescope - proved a public relations disaster for NASA. It was notuntil after the $1.5 billion telescope was in orbit that officialslearned its primary mirror was flawed.   Sending Discovery up and safely deploying Ulysses ``will be aboost for morale and a boost for NASA,'' said NASA project managerWillis Meeks.   A generator containing 23.7 pounds of plutonium-238 wasinstalled Tuesday in the probe, tucked inside Discovery's cargobay. Ulysses will use electricity generated from the decayingplutonium during its five-year journey in space.   While hooking up the generator, a worker accidentally shearedoff the head of one of four bolts on a small mechanical device usedto shift the generator to full power in space. Engineers decidedthree bolts were enough to secure the device, Willingham said.   It will be the second time a shuttle has transported plutonium.The Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft contained twice as much whenit was carried aloft by Atlantis last October.   An Energy Department team of nearly 100 people will be on handto monitor radiation in case an accident.   Activists afraid a Challenger-like accident would scatter thedeadly plutonium over Florida and result in untold cancerfatalities asked a judge on Tuesday to halt the launch.   A hearing is scheduled for Thursday in Washington before U.S.District Judge Oliver Gasch, who refused to stop last year's launchwith plutonium.   The activists said NASA is downplaying the threat of cancer andthat the space agency's inability to fix Columbia's hydrogen leakscalls into question its competency.   NASA replied in court papers that it conducts ``an elaborate andexhaustive safety review'' before a flight. Space agency officialsinsist the chance of a plutonium release is extremely small andwould pose little health risk.   NASA tried four times in four months to launch Columbia beforestopping two weeks ago to turn its attention to Discovery, whichmust lift off by Oct. 23 or wait 13 months for the planets to be inthe right alignment again.   Ulysses will speed toward Jupiter and use the planet's gravityto be whipped into orbit around the sun. The probe will explore thesun's poles in 1994 and 1995.   The mission is a joint effort of NASA and the European SpaceAgency, which supplied the $250 million satellite. NASA's share,estimated at $500 million, covers the launch and mission.</TEXT></DOC>
