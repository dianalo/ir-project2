The declines were world-wide -- and the price erosion thathad begun a few days ago and dropped U.S. crude futures morethan $1 a barrel last week appeared to be accelerating. Crudefutures were down yesterday to some of the lowest levelssince last summer.</LP><TEXT>   West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery fell 71cents a barrel to settle at $18.44 on the New York MercantileExchange. The June crude contract was down 61 cents to$18.95. Futures prices of fuels also were off sharply, withthe May contract for unleaded gasoline down 1.22 cents agallon.   Prices of petroleum outside the futures market alsocontinued to slide. U.S. refiners yesterday generally reducedthe prices they pay for West Texas Intermediate crude in thefield by 75 cents a barrel, to $17.50.   Meanwhile, bearish sentiment swept through European spotmarkets. North Sea crudes declined between 45 cents and 60cents a barrel from Friday's closing prices.   Analysts agree the reason for the sell-off was furtherevidence of a surplus of crude oil. They said it's due to twofactors: The seasonal slackening in demand for oil at thistime of the year -- underscored by the large number ofrefineries that are buying less crude because of maintenanceschedulings -- and the continued high production by theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   The Middle East Economic Survey is the latest industrypublication to cite high OPEC output. It reported that OPECproduced nearly 24.1 million barrels of crude oil a day inMarch, the highest monthly output since 1981.   But more oil analysts are beginning to look for a pricerecovery before the end of the second quarter, which istraditionally a sluggish oil-demand period.   At the least, &quot;the declines in prices should slow down bythe second half of the quarter,&quot; said George F. Friesen, oilanalyst with Deutsche Bank Capital Corp., New York. By then,he said, most refineries will have completed their springmaintenance and will be back in the market for crude.   Also, some oil analysts expect OPEC soon to try to dosomething about the price fall. &quot;OPEC overproduction hasbegun to hurt, but not yet enough to bring back productiondiscipline,&quot; said Fereidun Fesharaki of the Resource SystemsInstitute of Honolulu's East-West Center.   He looks for an $18 West Texas Intermediate price nextmonth to trigger a heated OPEC conference when the oilministers meet May 25. &quot;We see a sharp rebound after the OPECmeeting for the month of June,&quot; he said.   Philip K. Verleger Jr., an oil-price authority at theWashington-based Institute for International Economics, alsosees prices rebounding within a few weeks to $20 or $21 abarrel for West Texas Intermediate -- but for a differentreason. He said it's very profitable for refiners to buildcrude inventories at today's prices and then sell futures.&quot;It's a great hedging market for the refiners,&quot; he said.&quot;Crude prices will be stronger between now and the end of thesecond quarter,&quot; he added.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices fell from Friday's gains and endednear the low of the day. The May contract settled at $1.1670a pound for a loss of 4.40 cents a pound, slightly above theday's low of $1.1650. London Metal Exchange warehouse stocksof copper last week fell to 55,225 tons, down 3,900 tons, thelowest level since May 1988. But analysts said the figure wasa disappointment to traders who had expected a decline ofbetween 7,000 and 8,000 tons. Another price-depressingdevelopment, analysts said, was a Reuter news-service reportthat quoted Codelco, the Chilean state-owned copper company,as saying it would produce almost 1.3 million tons of refinedcopper this year, a 3.8% improvement from last year. Thecompany also was reported as saying that 1991 output wouldtotal 1,350,000 tons. Chile is the world's leading copperproducer. Meanwhile, analysts said striking miners andsmelter workers of Southern Peru Copper Corp. rejected thecompany's latest offer, continuing the strike that began onMarch 12. Peru is the world's sixth-largest copper producer.Traders seemed to ignore the development, analysts said. Oneanalyst observed that despite the market's action,price-supporting underlying factors remain in place. The dropin London supplies still indicates tight inventories, and thecontinuation of the Peruvian strike is also bullish, he said.At the moment, technically inspired selling appears toprevail. The analyst noted that the May futures price onFriday dipped below $1.19 a pound before recovering at theclose, and then fell sharply below that yesterday and failedto rebound. Another analyst said he felt that traders stillhadn't recovered from the sharp drop that followedWednesday's incorrect report that the Peruvian strike hadbeen settled. &quot;It took some wind out of potential buyers'sails, and they've remained cautious,&quot; he said.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Gold-futures prices declined on theperception that the dollar will continue to remain strong,despite expressions of concern about the yen by the majordeveloped nations after their meeting in Paris during theweekend. June-delivery gold was off $4.80 an ounce, to$380.40. May silver fell 6.2 cents an ounce, to $5.1280. Julyplatinum slipped 90 cents an ounce, to $481.70. Europeancentral banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve yesterdayintervened to support the yen, an analyst said, but tradersregarded this action as mostly aimed to give credibility tothe Group of Seven nations' concern over the Japanesecurrency, and it didn't really create gold demand. Anotheranalyst observed that the G-7 meeting failed to produceanything concrete that would stem the firmness in the U.S.currency, &quot;so the dollar is expected to continue to rise.&quot;Some of the selling was by producers, he said. Amongprice-depressing factors: The dollar firmed later in the dayand oil prices were sharply weaker. Peter Cardillo,futures-trading adviser for Josephthal andamp; Co., New York, saidthat, with the negative factors currently prevailing in gold,&quot;there could soon be a test of the $367.00 life-of-contractlow of the June contract.&quot;                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Price action remained subdued andtrading volume light ahead of this afternoon's release of twoAgriculture Department reports. The department's report onworld crops is likely to be read especially for its commentson the soybean harvest in Brazil, a major U.S. competitor inthe export market for soybeans. Another report will detailU.S. crop supply and demand figures as of April 1. Wheatfutures for May delivery slid 4.5 cents a bushel to close at$3.6075 a bushel, and May soybean futures declined 3.75 centsa bushel to close at $5.9175 a bushel.
