Senior officials in Tehran have said they would use theirinfluence with pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers if Westerngovernments helped locate and free the Iranians.   The Federation of Arab News Agencies appealed earlier Monday forthe release of Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent ofThe Associated Press. He has been held longest of the 15 foreignersmissing and known to have been kidnapped.   Anderson, one of nine Americans in captivity, was abducted March16, 1985.   Mohammad Ali Besharati, the Iranian official, told a newsconference at his country's embassy in Moslem west Beirut:   ``It will be most regrettable for us to hear that the fourmissing Iranians, who all had diplomatic status, are dead, but thiswill not prevent us from persisting in our humanitarian efforts tofree the Western hostages in line with our Islamic principles. Werefuse to allow any threat against the lives of innocents.''   Besharati's comment was the first public acknowledgment by Iranthat the men may be dead.   Among Iranian leaders offering help with the hostages was HashemiRafsanjani, the parliament speaker and military commander, whoaddressed this statement to Washington last month:   ``If you are interested in having your people held hostage inLebanon released, then tell the (Christian) Phalangists to releaseour people who have been in their hands for years.''   The missing Iranians are Ahmad Motevaselian, commander of IranianRevolutionary Guards based in the Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon;Charge d'Affaires Hussein Musavi; Kazem Akhavan, a correspondent ofIran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, and Rastegar Moqadam,a Lebanese Shiite driver with an Iranian passport.   They were seized at a checkpoint 25 miles north of Beirut in July1982 during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. The checkpoint at thenorthern tip of the Christian enclave was controlled by the LebaneseForces, the main Christian militia.   ``We shall continue to make efforts to free the hostages,''Besharati said, adding: ``some of the captors do sympathize with usand we don't know about the others. Perhaps our efforts willinfluence both groups.''   At its annual conference, the Federation of Arab News Agencies``discussed the question of Terry Anderson's continued abduction andresolved that this is hampering the publication of Arab news abroadand curbing the freedom of the press in general,'' secretary-generalFarid Ayyar said in a statement.   ``We appeal to Terry Anderson's holders to reconsider theirposition because the AP bureau chief was conducting a professionalmission without any involvement in the existing conflicts,'' he said.   Ayyar issued the statement after returning from federation's 17thannual meeting in Damascus, capital of Syria. Seventeen Arab newsagencies belong to the group.   Besharati arrived in Beirut on Sunday, after two days of talkswith Syrian officials in Damascus, and met with Lebanese leaders inBeirut before the news conference.   He said the main purpose of his trip was to reconcile Lebanon'stwo warring Shiite militias _ the pro-Syrian Amal and the Hezbollah,or Party of God, which is loyal to Iran and believed to be anumbrella group for the kidnappers.   The two factions are vying for dominance among Lebanon's 1million Shiites and fought a six-day street battle in west and southBeirut that was stopped a week ago by Syrian troops.   Syria has about 25,000 soldiers stationed in northern and easternLebanon and about 7,500 in the Moslem sectors of Beirut.   Besharati, appears to be the Iranian official in charge ofrelations with Lebanese Shiites. He was involved in an agreementthat ended a round of Amal-Hezbollah fighting in May.</TEXT></DOC>
