The CO{sub 2} LPA technique wasdemonstrated to be capable of detecting, with high specificity, a varietyof toxic compounds at low parts-per-billion (ppb) levels in multicomponentair samples. The technique can be used for monitoring trace levels ofvarious hazardous compounds in ambient air samples. A key achievementduring the program was determination of CO{sub 2} laser absorption cross-sectiondata for seven compounds of EPA concern that are volatile constituentsof hazardous chemical waste. The data show that the LPA method can detectthese compounds in ambient air at levels well below their most-stringentthreshold limit values.</TEXT></DOC>
