Carberry, the prosecutor who has spearheaded the government's criminal investigation of insider trading on Wall Street, will resign Oct. 1 to become a partner in the law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis andamp; Pogue.    By leaving amid the biggest insider-trading investigation ever, Mr. Carberry spurred speculation on Wall Street that the government might be having trouble with some of the cases it is working on.    But Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said in an interview that Mr. Carberry's departure will cause &quot;no significant delay&quot; in the progress of the government's insider-trading investigation. He noted that his office has three months to carry out the transition and that Mr. Carberry will be available until Oct. 1. Mr. Giuliani added that he recently assigned two more assistant U.S. attorneys to insider-trading matters.    The fact that Mr. Carberry will remain in the prosecutor's post until Oct. 1 may be a sign that the government will seek more major indictments in its insider investigation before then, lawyers said.    A highly regarded prosecutor with a reputation as an obsessive investigator and a wily negotiator, Mr. Carberry once observed that insider traders &quot;steal information and then they fence it. It's no different than if they were stealing ice skates.&quot;    Mr. Carberry, 36 years old, will be succeeded by Bruce Baird, 39, currently head of the narcotics unit of the U.S. attorney's office.    As chief of the securities and commodities fraud unit of the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, Mr. Carberry led the government's criminal prosecution of several securities industry figures, including investment banker Dennis B. Levine and stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky, both of whom pleaded guilty. Currently, he is working on the investigation of the investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Drexel hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing and has said it hasn't violated any laws.    After a string of early successes, the U.S. attorney's office suffered its first setback in the insider-trading investigation in May when it dropped criminal charges against three Wall Street arbitragers. The three were arrested last February in a public move that shocked Wall Street. The government has said it will seek expanded charges against the three men.    Several current and former assistant U.S. attorneys praised the choice of Mr. Baird as Mr. Carberry's successor. Mr. Baird's most visible case as an assistant U.S. attorney was conviction of Carmine Persico and other members of the Colombo crime family. Mr. Baird is a former associate at Davis, Polk andamp; Wardwell, a prominent New York law firm, and worked in the Justice Department in Washington in the mid-1970s.    Dennis LaBarre, Jones Day's managing partner in New York, said Mr. Carberry will specialize in white-collar criminal work in the firm's litigation group. Conflict-of-interest rules preclude Mr. Carberry from working on any matters he was involved in while at the U.S. attorney's office, but Mr. LaBarre said &quot;his expertise should be of great value.&quot; He added that Jones Day and Mr. Carberry have been discussing his joining the firm for the past month, and that Mr. Carberry accepted the firm's offer about two weeks ago.    Cleveland-based Jones Day is one of the country's largest law firms, with 725 lawyers in eight U.S. and five foreign offices. </TEXT></DOC>
