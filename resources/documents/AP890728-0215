Farm population has beendropping since 1916 and and small towns have been struggling formore than a century, said Beale, the Agriculture Departmentdemographer. He cites a book titled ``Dead Towns of Georgia'' _published in 1874.   New figures do provide a bit of good news for farmers whotoughed out the '80s. For 1988, Agriculture Department studies saidnet farm income was at a record high of $57.7 billion _ though someexperts caution that a small percentage of large-scale farmersaccount for a huge chunk of that.   Also last year, loan delinquencies reported by the Farm CreditSystem dropped $2 billion to half the level of two years ago. Twothousand farmers filed Chapter 12 bankruptcies, but that was lessthan a third of 1987's filings.   There is prosperity in some rural areas _ often in towns with aunifying core such as a county courthouse or a medical center,usually near a major highway.   ``If your town isn't on an interstate, forget it,'' said JamesR. Shortridge, a cultural biographer at the University of Kansas.   ``Development comes more quickly within 100 miles of a majortrading center or a city,'' Bergland said.   For many small towns, survival is assured with the arrival of amajor merchandising center with an anchor store, usually a Wal-Mart.   And yet this regional draw for one town often takes customersaway from the Main Street retailers of surrounding communities.   Rex Campbell, a University of Missouri rural sociologist,considers the spread of chain stores a major reason for theshifting rural landscape.   ``Wal-Mart is the innovator, they know how to target growth andthey're expert marketers and mass merchandisers. They were able togo into smaller markets than K mart or other competitors, and nowthey're replacing several mom-and-pop businesses, which formerlysold hardware, dry goods, clothes, shoes, and such.''   After Wal-Mart and some other discounters moved into Mason City,Iowa, people in outlying towns noticed their business dropping off.   Gene Persons, who has a grocery in Sheffield, 16 miles away,acknowledged, ``We sit here and try to do what we can to stop them.... There's only so many dollars to go around.'' He and others haveformed a ``commonwealth'' of neighboring small towns that poolresources to promote themselves.   For other pragmatic rural residents, adapting means working inthe city in order to live in the countryside.   Some Missourians, for example, drive 150 miles each way to theChrysler Corp. plant in the St. Louis suburb of Fenton to earn $15an hour, Campbell said. ``For every $1 of hourly wage, they'llcommute an average of 10 miles each way.''   Ultimately, authorities say, these approaches will not be enoughto ensure the survival of many little towns. They must rebuildtheir economies locally _ get access to investment money,telecommunications, transportation and educational opportunities.Perhaps most importantly, they must diversify.   ``How does rural America participate in the growth of aservice-oriented economy? That's the basic underlying question,''Beale said. ``It can't come out of agriculture. It has to come ofthe industries driving the national economy.''   Rural residents must even look beyond that, to the globaleconomy. Whereas corporations in the '50s and '60s moved to ruralAmerica for cheaper labor, now the Third World market is even moreenticing.   ``What it means for people is the same _ someone is out of ajob, a small town is dying,'' said Ann Tickamyer, assistantprofessor of sociology at the University of Kentucky. ``Unlessmajor efforts are taken to re-evaluate what we want in a ruraleconomy, the prognosis is fairly grim.''   A few residents, perhaps, will stay on in small towns that don'trethink and adjust, that don't go looking for employers todiversify a one-industry, boom-and-bust economy.   ``Those little places are never going to die, there will alwaysbe a housing unit or so, but they'll deteriorate,'' Campbell said.``What has been lost is the heart, and what you're left with is theshell.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 6</NOTE></DOC>
