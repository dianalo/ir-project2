The modes of the      amplifier depend upon the strength of the incoming signal and whether the      transmitter is transmitting. The receiver is also periodically      disconnected from the battery in order to further reduce power      consumption. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates generally to mobile radio communications      systems which include hand held telephones. More particularly, the      invention relates to a method and apparatus for reducing electrical power      consumption when operating a hand held cellular telephone. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  A cellular telephone system is a radio communication system in which a      plurality of mobile stations operate within a cell which is serviced by a      base station. There are typically a relatively large number of cells and      base stations in a given service area. The base station in each cell is      connected to a message switching center which in turn is connected to a      public telephone system. </PAR><PAR>  A recent innovation in the field of mobile radio communications is the hand      held or &quot;pocket&quot; telephone concept. These telephones are extremely light      weight, battery operated telephones that can be transported by an      individual. One of the major design constraints for &quot;pocket&quot; telephones is      the weight of such devices. These devices typically include a transceiver      unit, a rechargeable battery and a whip antenna. The weight of the battery      is a substantial portion of the total weight of the device. The battery      must be of sufficient size to power the &quot;pocket&quot; telephone for a useful      length of time. A relatively heavy battery enables the pocket telephone to      be powered for a longer period of time, but it reduces the      transportability of the &quot;pocket&quot; telephone. A lighter battery unit      increases the transportability of the &quot;pocket&quot; telephone, but it reduces      the useful operating time of the device between recharges. </PAR><PAR>  In the field of mobile radio communications, it is well known that the      electrical power consumption of the receiver can be reduced by      periodically disconnecting the receiver from the battery during      predetermined time periods. Typically, such battery saving devices      disconnect the receiver from the battery for a period of several      milliseconds. The receiver is then reconnected to the battery for a period      of several milliseconds, and the receiver is capable of monitoring a      control channel or receiving an incoming call. When a telephone call is      established, the receiver is continuously connected to the power supply.      After completion of the call, the receiver is again alternately connected      and disconnected from the power supply. During the idle mode or the      relatively long periods in which no calls are being made or received by      the mobile station, substantial amounts of electrical energy can be      conserved by disconnecting the receiver from the power supply. </PAR><PAR>  One of the major components within the receiver of a mobile station that      consumes substantial amounts of electrical energy is the amplifier. If the      amount of power consumed by the amplifier can be reduced, the size of the      battery can be made even smaller or alternatively the time between      recharges can be further increased. Accordingly, there is a need for an      improvement in the operation and structure of the amplifier in the      receiver of a &quot;pocket&quot; telephone. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to a method of reducing electrical power      consumption in a battery operated mobile station such as a &quot;pocket&quot;      telephone. The battery operated mobile station includes a transceiver unit      having a receiver and a transmitter that are responsive to frequency      synthesizers. The receiver receives a radio frequency signal and applies      it to an amplifier which is controlled by a processing circuit such as a      suitably programmed microprocessor. The amplifier is capable of operating      in three different modes. In the first mode the amplifier is biased to a      relatively high level whenever the transmitter is transmitting. In the      second mode, the amplifier is biased to a relatively high level when the      transmitter is turned off, and the receiver is receiving a relatively weak      radio frequency signal. In the third mode, the amplifier is substantially      disabled when the transmitter is turned off, and the receiver is receiving      a relatively strong radio frequency signal. The three modes of operation      for the amplifier are controlled by the microprocessor. The output of the      amplifier is applied to a mixer which mixes the received radio frequency      signal with the output of the frequency synthesizer associated with the      receiver. The output of the mixer is then applied to an intermediate      frequency stage and is processed in a conventional manner. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a block diagram which illustrates a mobile radio communication      apparatus that utilizes the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a simplified schematic diagram of an integrated circuit which      includes a portion of the receiver illustrated in FIG. 1; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a flow chart of the software used by the microprocessor to      control the receiver. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of a mobile cellular telephone      associated with the present invention. Although they are particularly      suited for use in portable &quot;pocket&quot; telephones, the principles of the      present invention are applicable to any type of mobile telephone in which      reduction of power consumption is desirable. The cellular telephone 9 of      the present invention includes a transceiver having a transmitter 10 and a      receiver 20 which are coupled to a common antenna 11. A transceiver      oscillator 18 is coupled to a transmitter frequency synthesizer 12 and a      receiver frequency synthesizer 17. The output of the transmitter frequency      synthesizer 12 is applied to a transmitter power amplifier 13. The output      of the transmitter power amplifier 13 is filtered by a transmitter filter      14 and is broadcasted through the antenna 11. </PAR><PAR>  The receiver 20 receives incoming radio frequency (RF) signals through the      antenna 1 and filters the incoming signals with a receiver filter 15. The      filtered RF signals are applied to a low noise receiver stage 21. The      receiver 20 is coupled to a power supply 19 and is controlled by a      microprocessor 16. The receiver 20 preferably includes the filter 15, the      low noise receiver stage 21, a second filter 22, a mixer 23 and an      intermediate frequency (IF) stage which is not shown. The filter 22 is a      bandpass filter, preferably a so-called ceramic filter well known in the      art. Its center frequency is the RF frequency and its bandwidth is such      that both the frequency RFandplus;2IF and the component RF-2IF are attenuated.      Typically, the IF is 45  MHz. Preferably, the low noise receiver stage 21      and the mixer 23 are implemented on an integrated circuit. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 2, a simplified schematic diagram illustrates the      portion of the receiver 20 implemented on an integrated circuit. The      integrated circuit includes the mixer 23 and an amplifier 24 which is the      major component in the low noise receiver stage 21. The input to the      amplifier 24 is the filtered RF signal which is designated as R.sub.x. The      integrated circuit includes a ground terminal GND and an input voltage      terminal V.sub.cc which are coupled to the power supply 19. An input      terminal designated Transmit receives a signal indicating that the      transmitter 10 is operating. The integrated circuit includes an input      terminal L.sub.O which receives the output signal L.sub.O from the      receiver frequency synthesizer 17. The amplifier 24 also includes an input      terminal for a signal GS.sub.enable which is provided by the      microprocessor 16. The GS.sub.enable input receives &quot;low&quot; and &quot;high&quot;      control signals. When the GS.sub.enable signal is &quot;low&quot; the amplifier has      no current supply and is substantially disabled. When the GS.sub.enable is      &quot;high&quot; the amplifier is enabled. The low noise receiver stage 21 also      includes the circuitry necessary to match the control signals such as the      Transmit signal and GS.sub.enable signal to the amplifier 24. </PAR><PAR>  The mobile station, as is conventional in the art, measures an RSSI      (Receiver Strength Signal Indicator) signal associated with the IF stage.      The RSSI signal has a voltage which is a function of the voltage of the      received signal in the antenna. An A/D converter can be used to convert      the RSSI signal to a digital format suitable for application to the      microprocessor 16. The microprocessor can then determine whether the      signal is relatively weak or strong, and whether the signal is strong      enough that the amplifier 24 can be disabled. </PAR><PAR>  The output of the amplifier 24 is an output signal designated RF.sub.out.      The signal RF.sub.out is provided at an output terminal designated      RF.sub.out and is applied to the filter 22. The filter 22 filters the      signal and applies it as a filtered input signal RF.sub.in to the mixer 23      at an input terminal designated RF.sub.in. The mixer 23 mixes the signals      applied at the L.sub.O input terminal and the RF.sub.in terminal. The      mixer 23 generates an output signal at an output terminal IF that is      coupled to the IF stage. The IF stage processes the IF signals in a      conventional fashion. </PAR><PAR>  The RF gain stage or amplifier 24 disposed on the integrated circuit      illustrated in FIG. 2 preferably conforms to the specifications listed      below in Table 1. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 1                                                          ______________________________________                                         Frequency        860-970 MHz                                                   Gain             min, 15 db, but min. -5 db if                                                  disabled                                                      Nominal Input Level                                                                             -10 dBm                                                       Maximum Input Level                                                                             andplus;5 dBm                                                        Input Impedance  50 ohm, input return loss andlt;-10                                                 dB                                                            Output Impedance 50 ohm, output return loss                                                     andlt;-10 dB                                                       1 dB Input Compression Point                                                                    -10 dBm min.

The low noise      receiver stage 21 is also designed to work well in spite of the      interfering signal appearing at the input of receiver 20 when the      transmitter 10 is on. This feature is obtained by having a sufficiently      high receiver &quot;compression point&quot;. The &quot;compression point&quot; of an amplifier      is when the output signal of the amplifier deviates from an ideal linear      function of the input signal by a value such as 1 dBm. Increasing the      &quot;compression point&quot;, however, means increasing the power consumption of      the receiver 20. The low noise receiver stage 21 and amplifier 24 are      controlled by the microprocessor 16 such that there are three different      modes of operation. </PAR><PAR>  The first mode is called the transmit mode. If the transmitter 10 is      sending, it is desireable for the entire circuit including the amplifier      24 to be enabled. As a result, the circuit is in a high current      consumption mode. The biasing of the amplifier 24 is relatively high      giving good sensitivity and good suppression of the interfering signals      from the transmitter 10. During the transmit mode, the control signal      which is designated Transmit is enabled, causing the gain stage or      amplifier 24 to be enabled. </PAR><PAR>  In the transmit mode there will be typically an interfering input signal      detected by the receiver 20 with a frequency of 45 megahertz below the      frequency of the desired input signal. This interfering signal results      from the transmitter being on. The interfering signal will have a maximum      level of andplus;5 dBm. Ideally the circuit should provide the same performance      for the desired input signal independent of the presence of the      interfering signal. This means that the desired signal must not be      degraded due to the presence of the interfering signal. To achieve such a      result it is necessary to enable the amplifier 24 and to allow a higher      current consumption for the circuit in the transmit mode. </PAR><PAR>  The second mode of operation is called the standby enable mode. When the      transmitter 10 is off and the received signal is weak, the amplifier 24 is      enabled by the microprocessor 16 in the standby enable mode. The standby      enable mode occurs only when the transmitter is off, and the amplifier 24      is biased for relatively low noise and high gain. This is possible with a      low compression point if a relatively poor suppression of the interfering      signals is accepted. </PAR><PAR>  The third mode of operation for the receiver 20 is preferably called the      standby disable mode. This mode occurs when the transmitter 10 is off and      the receiver 20 detects a high level input signal. In this mode the      amplifier 24 is totally disabled or biased to a relatively low level by      the microprocessor 16. Since the input signal has a high level, the      amplifier 24 can be switched off, and the remaining sensitivity is      sufficient for detecting the digital signal with a relatively low bit      error. </PAR><PAR>  The control of the microprocessor 16 over the receiver 20 of the mobile      station 9 will now be explained through the use of the simplified flow      chart of FIG. 3. The flow chart of FIG. 3 depicts the logic of the      software necessary to control the receiver 20. The microprocessor 16 is      started at step 30 and performs the step 31 of activating the mobile      station 9. In step 32 the microprocessor connects the receiver 20 to a      power supply 19. When the receiver 20 is connected to the power supply 19,      incoming signals can be received and processed. </PAR><PAR>  The microprocessor 16 determines in step 33 whether the transmitter 10 is      on. If the transmitter 10 is on, a Transmit signal is sent to the receiver      20, and the amplifier 24 is biased to a relatively high level. If the      microprocessor 16 decides that the transmitter 10 is not on, the      microprocessor 16 then performs the step 35 of determining the strength of      the received signal. If the received signal is not strong, the      microprocessor 16 generates an instruction 36 in order to bias the      amplifier 24 to a relatively high level. If the microprocessor 16 in step      35 determines that the received signal is relatively strong, the      microprocessor 16 generates an instruction 37 to bias the amplifier 24 to      a relatively low level. Since the mobile station 9 at this point is not      transmitting, the microprocessor 16 periodically generates an instruction      38 disconnecting the receiver 20 from the power supply 19. By periodically      disconnecting the receiver 20 from the power supply 19, substantial      amounts of electrical power can be conserved. </PAR><PAR>  The microprocessor 16 then determines in step 39 whether the mobile station      9 is still active. If the mobile station 9 is still active, the      microprocessor 16 then reconnects the power supply 19 to the receiver 20      with instruction 32. If the mobile station 9 is to be deactivated, then      the microprocessor 16 takes the necessary actions to deactivate the mobile      station 9. The deactivation of the mobile station is indicated by step 40      which signifies the end of operation. </PAR><PAR>  While the invention has been described in its preferred embodiments, it is      to be understood that the words that have been used are words of      description rather than of limitation and the changes within the purview      of the appended claims may be made without departing from the true scope      and spirit of the invention in its broader aspects. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
