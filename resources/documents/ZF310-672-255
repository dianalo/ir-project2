(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Acer America Corp. has introduced the AcerFrame 3000SP33, the first in afamily of 80486-based open-system platforms designed specifically fordepartmental client/server environments.andM;This fully featured platform provides an foundation for system integratorsand high-end resellers tailoring networking, multiuser and database solutionsfor demanding business applications.andM;Packaged in a double wide tower housing, the AcerFrame 3000SP33 hasprovisions for performance, peripheral storage, security and enhancedreliability previously associated only with proprietary minicomputers.andP;  Asingle processor implementation utilizing the Intel i486 at 33MHz, it is ahigh-performance (27 Drhystrone MIPS) platform that combines a variety ofdesign features for under $12,000.andM;&quot;Unlike other products that are little more than PCs turned on their side,this platform was designed and built from the ground up to be a truemultiuser/network server platform,&quot; said Ken Tai, president of Acer AmericaBusiness Unit.andM;&quot;The AcerFrame 3000SP33 reflects the combined resources of the Acer/Altosrelationship, resulting in a system design that contains the performance,expandability, and security features demanded for this class of machine.&quot;andM;The AcerFrame 3000SP33 has enhanced the 80486 processor performance by addinga 128KB secondary write-back cache to achieve a system hit rate of 95percent.andP;  The system utilizes an Extended Industry Standard Architecture(EISA) system bus to support increased I/O performance through the use ofintelligent 32-bit bus master peripheral controllers.andM;Eight EISA expansion slots provide the flexibility to configure the AcerFrame3000SP33 for demanding configurations required for networking andmultiuser/UNIX applications.andM;Designed to serve a workgroup between eight and 64 concurrent users, theAcerFrame 3000SP33 supports industry standard operating environments,including Novell NetWare, SCO and ISC UNIX, Banyan Vines and OS/2 LanManager.andM;SECURITY AND RELIABILITY Data security and system integrity are keyrequirements for the networking and multiuser/UNIX market that the AcerFrame3000SP33 addresses.andP;  The system comes standard with an environmentaldiagnostic monitoring subsystem with front panel LCD display.andM;System &quot;checkpoints&quot; are recorded during the initial boot process allowingthe system administrator to track and isolate system state conditions.andO;Additionally, EISA system bus activity is monitored for analysis andperformance fine-tuning.andM;An optional uninterruptable power supply (UPS) allows the system to execute agraceful shutdown if a power failure is detected, ensuring data integrity.andM;The UPS conveniently fits underneath the base system to minimize floor spacerequirements.andP;  Environmental sensors detect excessive ambient temperatureconditions allowing the system administrator to monitor and bring the systemto a quiescent state for analysis.andM;System security is greatly enhanced on the AcerFrame 3000SP33 through the useof a variety of hardware and software security features.andP;  The system cabinetkeylock controls access to the inside of the enclosure containing theremovable media drives, while also securing the system keyboard and mouse.andM;Software password security prevents unauthorized access to the system,read/write access to floppy and hard disk peripherals and access to I/Oports.andP;  Finally, a recessed cable panel prevents unauthorized tampering withdevice connectors.andM;POWER AND EXPANDABILITY The AcerFrame 3000SP33's 32-bit architecture makes itideal for I/O intensive environments such as networking, multiuser/UNIX anddatabase applications.andM;With a 33MB/second burst mode data transfer rate and support for intelligentbus master peripherals, the system can perform overlapped memory and I/Ooperations without additional overhead on the 80486 processor.andM;With eight EISA expansion slots, the AcerFrame 3000SP33 maintains fullbackward compatibility with the broad base of commerically available ISAexpansion boards.andM;An EISA SCSI disk controller is available together with certification from avariety of third party EISA peripheral cards supporting Ethernet and TokenRing network interface cards as well as multiport serial I/O cards forasynchronous connections under the UNIX operating system.andM;The double-wide tower design provides drive bays for eight half-heightdrives, allowing configurations supporting more than 2GB of internal on-linestorage using SCSI hard disk drives.andM;An optional Disk Array Subsystem, supporting RAID level 5 implementation willsupport up to eight half-height drives each.andM;PRICING AND AVAILABILITY The AcerFrame 3000SP33 will be available in May 1991and will have a suggested list price of $11,995 in the base configuration.andM;AcerFrame 3000SP33 Product SpecificationsandM;FEATURESandM;o Double-wide tower designandM;o Intel 80486 operating at 33MHzandM;o Secondary level processor cacheandM;o Eight EISA-bus expansion slotsandM;o Built-in VGA and LCD consoleandM;o System security provisionsandM;o Screwless cabinet designandM;PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONSandM;o 80486/33MHz CPUandM;o 128KB external write-back cacheandM;o 8MB RAM, expandable to 64MBandM;o 5.25-inch floppy disk driveandM;o Support for eight 5.25-inch, half-height drivesandM;o Two RS-232C serial portsandM;o One parallel portandM;o One mouse portandM;o Environmental monitor cardandM;o 800 by 600 SVGAandM;o LCD DisplayandM;o 101/102-key keyboardandM;o 430 Watt SPS (110V)andM;o MS-DOSandM;o EISA configuration utilitiesandM;DIMENSIONSandM;Handequals;24.6 inches;
