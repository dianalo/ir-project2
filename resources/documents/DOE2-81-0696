It is shown that there are impurities,which can considerably decrease the rate of liquid impurity migration,since they are low soluble. When choosing the site for radioactive wastestorage, the decelerating effect of such impurities on the impurity migrationshould be taken into account, as it promotes an increase in the wastedisposal safety.</TEXT></DOC>
