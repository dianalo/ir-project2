But the high price, an effective 6.4% pay raisethat steelmakers had to pay to win the peace, stokes anxietythat Germany will be drawn into a wage-price spiral.   Faced with a slowing economy, a rapidly expanding M-3money supply, and the costs of financing reconstruction ineastern Germany, politicians have been pleading with Germanunions to be moderate in their wage demands. German EconomicsMinister Juergen Moellemann has said that the economy canonly tolerate wage increases of less than 5% withoutthreatening stability. German industrialists worry that aswelling of already high labor costs will hurt the country'scompetitive position.</LP><TEXT>   Although the expensive settlement with IG Metall'ssteelworkers affects their employers most immediately --steelmakers estimate it will cost them up to 600 millionmarks ($372 million) a year -- another consequence of thepact is that other unions may regard a 6.4% pay increase asthe floor rather than as the ceiling for settlements in 1992.   Dirk von Mitzlaff, head of the steel employersassociation, said the industry viewed the compromise asacceptable only as a way to avoid the extreme cost anddisruptions of a strike, and should not under anycircumstances be viewed as a pathbreaker for 1992 wage talks.A strike could have cost the industry upward of 500 millionmarks, he said.   IG Metall Chairman Franz Steinkuehler countered that thepact should serve as a &quot;reasonable basis . . . for other wageagreements this year.&quot;   &quot;The problem is that this gives the other unions headlineswith a 6.4% figure to wave around,&quot; said Ros Lifton, Europeaneconomist at Nomura Research Institute in Frankfurt. &quot;That'sbound to affect wage negotiations.&quot; And industrialists arevoicing strong concerns about the long-term impact of unionsdemanding wage increases that outstrip productivityincreases.   &quot;We have to change our mentality in western Germany ofjust working less and less and having wage increases everyyear,&quot; said Heinrich Weiss, president of the Federation ofGerman Industry. &quot;We must come out of our sleep and see thatother industrial countries of the world are more competitive.Working only 35 hours a week and enjoying all the fringebenefits and luxuries in life, we cannot maintain ourposition.&quot;   In a similar vein, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has expressedconcern that Germany could become a &quot;vacation republic,&quot; andhas exhorted unions to be more modest so resources can befunneled to the east.   If other unions win similar settlements, the chances growever more remote that the Deutsche Bundesbank, Germany'scentral bank, will be able to lower interest rates any timesoon, economists said. &quot;Quite clearly, an early Bundesbankrate cut isn't in the cards,&quot; said James Barty, Europeaneconomist at Morgan Grenfell andamp; Co. in London. &quot;We might haveto wait until the third quarter or maybe the fourth quarterfor a rate cut.&quot;   Last Friday, IG Metall announced that 86.8% of itsmembership in the steel sector endorsed a strike to press itsdemand for an effective 10.5% raise. Throughout the weekend,there appeared to be little hope of breaking the standoffbetween the union, demanding at least a 6.7% raise, and theindustry, holding firm at an average 5.7% raise. But lateSunday night, with behind-the-scenes prodding of North RhineWestphalia's Minister President Johannes Rau, the negotiatorsmet in a hotel and struck the compromise.   IG Metall's tariff commission overwhelmingly approved thedeal Monday morning. The final sanction is to come from an IGMetall poll of its members between Feb. 7 and Feb. 12. Onlyif more than 75% of workers want a strike would workstoppages still be considered.   The agreement calls for a 5.9% across-the-board payincrease retroactive to last Nov. 1, as well as a one-timepayment of 175 marks. On November 1, the base wage would beincreased to match that of the metalworkers, now 15.42 marks.The equalization of steelworkers pay with other metalworkerswas one of the union's primary goals.</TEXT></DOC>
