Courts had previously upheld the FSLIC's right to adjudicate creditors' claims. But the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that creditors who have claims against failed Sandamp;Ls can bring the FSLIC to court to try their cases.    The appeals court said that &quot;as receiver for the failed associations. . . . FSLIC stands in the shoes of the insured institution.&quot; If the FSLIC is held liable for the fraud and wrongdoing of thrifts it has closed, it could greatly increase the losses of the already insolvent agency.    Officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which oversees the FSLIC, weren't available for comment yesterday on the decision. The FSLIC had argued that fast recovery of its insurance payouts through quick liquidations of failed thrifts was &quot;highly important&quot; to maintaining its reserves, and that going through the courts would cause delays harmful to the agency's financial interests.    However, the court said the &quot;legislative history, the particular provisions upon which FSLIC relies, and the entire statutory scheme leave us convinced that Congress intended not to confer on FSLIC the adjudicatory power it seeks.&quot;    The case resulted from the claims of a number of creditors suing Westside Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, which was declared insolvent and taken over by FSLIC in August 1985. Creditors want their cases to be decided by the courts, rather than through the FSLIC's administrative process.    The court noted that the FSLIC's insurance fund is under &quot;unprecedented strain&quot; because of the &quot;nationwide deterioration of the savings and loan industry,&quot; noting the huge increase in the number of failed thrifts since 1980. The court said it was a &quot;growing concern&quot; that the FSLIC generally recoups a considerable portion of its insurance payments in the distribution of an insolvent thrift's liquidated assets.    The cases against the FSLIC as receiver for Westside were sent back to lower courts. The FSLIC can appeal the decision to a nine-member panel of the Ninth Circuit court, or seek permission from the Solicitor General to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.    The FSLIC has about $1.9 billion of reserves left, but the costs of the failures it is trying to currently handle, and impending failures expected to total $15 billion to $25 billion, leave the agency insolvent.    Legislation to raise as much as $25 billion for the FSLIC over five years is awaiting consideration before the House and Senate banking committees.    &quot;This case could mean that the FSLIC will see an awful lot more litigation,&quot; said a prominent Sandamp;L attorney unconnected with the cases who asked to not be named. &quot;What the FSLIC is paying in litigation costs is already huge, and it's going to get larger now.&quot;    &quot;It's a very significant ruling, because FSLIC has so many failed Sandamp;Ls, with so many competing creditors. It's a big blow to FSLIC,&quot; said Martin Crowder, attorney for a creditor committee seeking $15 million to $20 million from the FSLIC on behalf of Westside.    He said the creditors wanted their claims heard in court because, &quot;we didn't feel we'd get a fair shake in the administrative process. . . . Technically, FSLIC has an interest.&quot; He said that if the creditors he represents don't get their money, &quot;it goes into FSLIC's pockets.&quot;    William Abrams, an attorney for Stevenson Associates, a limited partnership seeking funds from Westside, said his clients &quot;want their day in court. . . . FSLIC has no interest in paying us.&quot;    Many of the insolvent thrifts now in receivership allegedly engaged in some form of fraud. The FSLIC, which insures thrift deposits up to $100,000 an account, has more than 30 suits itself alleging fraud or negligence by the officers and directors of thrifts it closed. One former official of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the FSLIC's parent, said that the issue of liability for any fraud by the Sandamp;Ls is of great concern to the Bank Board's legal department.    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is also concerned about its liability for fraud allegedly committed by failed commercial banks. Last December, a U.S. district court held that the FDIC is liable for fraud claims brought by uninsured depositors. That case stemmed from the collapse of Penn Square Bank in July 1982. The court held that the FDIC, as receiver for Penn Square, had to pay $1.9 million of lost principal to two uninsured depositors, based on verdicts that the receiver had a legal responsibility for fraud perpetrated by Penn Square's management, including the issuance of false and misleading financial statements. </TEXT></DOC>
