Because benefits are as much a cost of doing business as wagesand salaries, the inflationary pressure, or pressure on producerand consumer prices, is much the same. And the costs of some ofthose benefits are indeed rising.   However, tending to obscure the benefits rise is the publicdisplay in many areas of rising wages at fast-food restaurants,shopping malls and supermarkets which, others things being equal,will show up in higher prices.   In a city near here, for example, a roadside supermarket signonce reserved for sales and specials advertises ``Hiring Now. $7 AnHour,'' a rate more than double the minimum wage. At some nearbyrestaurants, the signboards and table mats may carry help-wantedmessages rather than the usual menu items.   But the statistics tell a different story _ that average weeklyearnings of $328.86 in March, while $1.64 higher than in February,were still below the January level of $329.13, hardly aninflationary trend.   Getting less attention are benefits, which soared last year andremain a source of worry for employers. Many are seeking to reducethe load, a turnabout from the practice of the previous decade,when benefits were added lavishly.   The cost to business of benefits last year jumped 6.8 percent,almost double the 3.5 percent rate of increase in 1987, accordingto Labor Department figures. A good deal of that increase resultedfrom ever-increasing health care items and a Social Security rise.   The Social Security tax increase for employers, which broughtthe rate to 7.51 percent from 7.15 percent of payroll in 1987,won't be duplicated this year and so is at least temporarilyremoved as an inflationary factor.   However, inflation in the general health care category remains afactor in business costs, resisting the hold-down efforts of agrowing number of employers, large and small. While othercategories were brought under control in recent years, health carehas persistently, defiantly gone its own way.   The pay rise last year was much less than for benefits,increasing 4.1 percent, or not even as much as the consumer priceindex. Still, it was much faster than the 3.3 percent gain of 1987.   The question now is whether private business can absorb theincreases or will be forced to pass them on through the chain ofproducers, manufacturers and distributors, relentlessly andeventually reaching the consumer.   On the plus side, some manufacturers have greatly improved theirefficiency in the past decade. Whether such efficiencies can helpthem hold the line in the face of reduced sales and rising costs isanother matter.   On the minus side, unemployment is now down to 5 percent of allcivilian workers and well under that for adult men and women.That's a 15-year low, suggesting the labor pool is being drained ofproductive workers.   By using less efficient workers, and untrained workers who mayrequire extensive instruction, business will be under a strain tohold prices. But an even bigger strain might be in containingbenefits costs.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Tuesday, April 11.</NOTE></DOC>
