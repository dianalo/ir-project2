No significant effects on affinity were found,as Kd control values for receptors derived from rat bone marrow averaged57 (+/- 28) pM while experimental (hypoxic) values averaged 89 (+/- 55)pM. Kd control values in rat lung were found to average 142 (+/- 22)pM while average values derived from experimental protocols with ozoneand methimazole were 267 (+/- 44) pM and 161 (+/- 35) pM respectively.Finally, Kd control values for receptors derived from cultured MEL cellsaveraged 19 (+/- 2.6) pM while experimental values during exposure toDMSO or IGF1 were 23 (+/- 3.6) pM and 26 (+/- 11) pM respectively. Incontrast, binding capacity (expressed as fmoles of hormone bound perunit protein of solubilized receptor) was markedly perturbed in severaltissues by various agents: ozone effects on lung were shown by an averagecontrol value of 3.3 (+/- 0.4) as opposed to an experimental averageof 28 (+/- 1.9); and hypoxia effects on erythroid tissue were displayedby an average control value of 0.7 (+/- 0.07) as opposed to the experimentalfigure of 1.8 (+/- 0.03). In cultured MEL cells, binding capacity wasseen to be increased from control values of 388 (+/- 15) sites/cell to1243 (+/- 142) sites/cell after DMSO exposure and 2002 (+/- 10) sites/cellafter IGF1 exposure. Parallel experiments done with receptors derivedfrom rat liver yielded values similar to those reported by other investigatorsand were unaffected by the experimental agents.</TEXT></DOC>
