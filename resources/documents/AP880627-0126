HIDLAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's largest organization of doctorsbegan debate Monday on a wide range of AIDS proposals, includingrecommendations for testing the nation's prison population and forstates to trace the sex partners of infected people.   The proposals were part of a main report and four backgroundpapers approved by the board of trustees of the American MedicalAssociation and set for action by the 420-member house of delegatesrepresenting 295,000 doctors before its annual policymakingconvention ends Thursday.   Included in the AMA board's proposals are recommendations that:   _The nation expand treatment programs for intravenous drugabusers, because they pose the most explosive potential forspreading the deadly disease into the heterosexual population.   _U.S. women infected with the AIDS virus avoid breast feeding toreduce the chance of giving the disease to their children.   _``Vigorous enforcement'' of existing antidiscrimination laws toprotect AIDS victims.   _The president to create a new, national AIDS commissionidentical to the one that recently finished its work ``to providethe essential coordination between public and private institutionsthat are addressing AIDS.''   ``This is a disease we can't become casual about,'' said Dr.John Dawson, an AMA trustee and a surgeon from Seattle. ``We'restill waiting for the explosion of cases that will arouse thecountry.''   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's abilityto fight disease and is spread primarily through sexualintercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from breast-feedingmothers to their infants. It is fatal and incurable.   By 1991, the nation likely will have 270,000 cases of AIDS, thereport said, affirming previous estimates by other groups.   In 1986, 148,060 people were tested in the United States forinfection by the AIDS virus and 22,775, or 15.4 percent, testedpositive, the main report said. Preliminary results for 1987 showedthat 623,493 people were tested and 17,629, or 2.8 percent, testedpositive.   The report attributed the drop in positive tests to the openingof new testing centers in areas with a low prevalence of AIDS.   The AMA board recommended that all states without contacttracing seriously consider launching such programs in an effort toslow the disease's spread among heterosexuals.   ``You have the potential for a frightening expansion of AIDSinto the heterosexual community,'' Dawson said. ``That's wherecontact tracing would be important.''   But the AMA acknowledges that legal or other issues may blocksuch programs, Dawson added.   The report also reaffirms the AMA's call for mandatory AIDStesting of all prison inmates because of the high prevalence ofinfection among them.   However, the AMA's proposed policy calls on prisons to takesteps to protect the confidentiality of AIDS-infected prisoners.   Several delegates and health officials spoke against theproposal Monday, saying it wouldn't serve any purpose unlessAIDS-infected inmates were segregated from other prisoners and thattesting may be too costly.   A report focusing on intravenous drug abusers recommends thatfederal and state governments increase funding for free drugtreatment programs, but stopped short of calling for providing drugaddicts access to clean, uncontaminated needles as some countrieshave begun doing.</TEXT></DOC>
