(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An outside review of the deadly 1984 gasleak at a Bhopal, India plant was intended to objectively assessesthe cause of the disaster, Union Carbide Corp. says, although theresulting report provides little new information on the incident.   The report released Tuesday by the firm Arthur D. Little Inc.supported Carbide's claims that sabotage by a disgruntled employeecaused the disaster. It also refuted as ``physically impossible''the Indian government's contention that the disaster stemmed fromnegligence.   ``We wanted the world to know that somebody that had areputation that was worldwide and sterling...would look at thingscritically,'' said Bud Holman, a Carbide attorney.   The report did not provide a motive for sabotage or name theworker believed responsible.   But Holman said the company and the Indian government knew theworker's identity, and it eventually would be revealed in court. Hesaid the worker wanted to punish a superior who had demoted him.   Ashok Kalelkare, a senior vice president of Arthur D. Little,based in Cambridge, Mass., presented the findings Tuesday to aLondon symposium sponsored by the Institute of Chemical Engineersof the United Kingdom.   An Indian government attorney involved in the case on declinedcomment on the report today, saying it would be ``improper whilewe're in litigation.'' He insisted on anonymity.   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Carbideclosed up 75 cents a share to $23.87{ on Tuesday.   At least 2,850 people were killed and 20,000 injured when methylisocyanate gas leaked from a holding tank at Union Carbide IndiaLtd.'s Bhopal plant on Dec. 3, 1984.   More than 500,000 people have filed claims in the case and theIndian government filed criminal charges against Carbide inDecember.   The Arthur D. Little report theorized that a worker entered theplant's storage area during a shift change the night of Dec. 2,1984, and hooked a rubber hose to the methyl isocyanate tank withthe intention of ruining the tank's contents.   The chemical produces a deadly gas when mixed with water.   ``The results of this investigation show, with virtualcertainty, that the Bhopal incident was caused by the entry ofwater to the tank through a hose that had been connected directlyto the tank,'' the report stated. ``It is equally clear that thosemost directly involved attempted to obfuscate these events.''   The report was based on interviews with more than 70 formeremployees of the now-closed plant.   Among those interviewed was an unidentified instrumentsupervisor who told investigators that the day after the disasterhe discovered a gauge on the chemical tank had been replaced with aplug. Nearby, he also noticed a length of hose with water runningfrom it, the report said.   The report theorized that the gauge was removed, the hoseinserted, and the hole filled with a plug once the water had beenadded to the tank.   The Indian government contends that water got into the chemicaltank when a worker failed to install a ``slip-blind,'' a devicethat prevents water from backing up, while cleaning a filter about400 feet away.   But Arthur D. Little's report asserted the theory wasimplausible for three reasons: the worker's hose pressure wasn'thigh enough to raise the water to the level of the chemical tank; asafety valve to prevent such a mishap was found in good workingorder after the accident; and pipes that would have remained filledwith water after such an occurrence were dry.   The report alleged that workers altered plant logs to hide thatthey tried to drain the tank after realizing water had been added.   The consultant's report was highly critical of the Indiangovernment, saying it stuck to the negligence theory despiteevidence to the contrary and hindered Union Carbide's ability todiscover what actually happened.   The company finally got access to key plant records and throughthem the names of plant employees when a U.S. magistrate orderedIndia to produce copies of the documents as part of the civil suitto which it was a party</TEXT></DOC>
