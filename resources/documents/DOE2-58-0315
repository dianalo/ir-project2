Therefore, it is important to have a mathematical model which,together with experimental tests, makes it possible to identify the explosionmechanism as well as to predict loads on the containment. On the basisof some hypotheses on the shape of the flame and on the thermofluiddynamicstate of the mixture, the HYDE.10 code provides the pressure transientinside a closed vessel during the deflagration of a Hydrogen-Air-Steammixture. Moreover, the code is able to define the flame shape, the burningvelocity and the physical constants of the mixture. Finally, it definesthe average values of the pressure and of the mean temperature for anabiabatic isochoric combustion as well as the flame temperature for aninsenthalpic combustion. Despite the hypotheses, the analytical modelhas a wide range of applications and it is used to interpret the resultsof the experimental tests which are carried out at the Department ofNuclear and Mechanical Constructions of the University of Pisa.</TEXT></DOC>
