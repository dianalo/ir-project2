(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Author Shana Alexander didn't libel a NewYork City psychologist accused of sleeping with a patient, New Yorkstate's highest court ruled today.   The Court of Appeals refused to reinstate psychologist HermanWeiner's $1 million libel suit against Alexander and the Doubledaybook company, publisher of ``Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder: AFamily Album.''   In a separate opinion today, the court also refused to reinstatean Austrian research company's libel suit against a scientificjournal. A lower court had dismissed both lawsuits before anydamages were awarded.   Alexander's book detailed the murder of Franklin Graham and thetrials of his grandson, Marc Schreuder, and daughter, FrancesSchreuder, for the crime.   Weiner, an advocate of the controversial ``primal scream''therapy, treated Ms. Schreuder, court papers said.   The book reports a claim by Richard Behrens, a friend of Ms.Schreuder's, that the woman ``always slept with her shrinks.''According to the book, Graham's mother, sister and brother-in-lawsaid they had always ``suspected hanky-panky'' between Weiner andMs. Schreuder.   Weiner, who is married, has denied having sex with Ms. Schreuder.   But the court refused to reinstate the libel suit, sayingAlexander had sufficiently confirmed the challenged statementbecause she or her researcher had talked to the people mostfamiliar with Ms. Schreuder's personal life.   Under state case law, when a topic is one of legitimate publicconcern, a defamed person must establish that the publisher was``grossly irresponsible'' in gathering information to prove libel.The court said the case didn't meet that standard.   Alexander's lawyers had asked the court to rule that thestatement was opinion, and therefore deserving of constitutionalfree speech protection. But the court refused.   ``We leave for another day ... the question whether `opinion'protection whould be enlarged to encompass the type of work that isthe focus of the present controversy,'' Judge Judith Kaye wrote ina unanimous decision.   The other libel case involved Immuno AG, a company that conductsresearch on chimpanzees. The company sued the editor of the Journalof Medical Primatology, accusing Dr. Jan Moor-Jankowski ofknowingly publishing false material in a letter to the editor.   Immuno AG said the letter, which accused the company of killingchimpanzee mothers to get animals for testing, made it the targetof animal rights activists.   The letter was preceded by an editors' note identifying itswriter as an animal rights activist and said that the company'slawyers considered her statements to be inaccurate.   The court, in a decision also by Judge Kaye, concluded that theletter reflected someone's opinion and was protected byconstitutional free speech guarantees.</TEXT></DOC>
