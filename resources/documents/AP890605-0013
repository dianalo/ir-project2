The names conjure up drama anddisaster, a decade of human suffering and scientific inquiry intothe earth's volcanoes.   Around the world, the erupting mountains that help emphasize theunsettled nature of the planet become the subject of intensecuriosity when they initiate tragedy. Then they fade from centerstage, of interest only to scientists, relief workers and localresidents.   Some of the researchers who chronicle and study these eventshave now collected a decade's worth of records, major ones of greatimpact and smaller eruptions notable for little beyond theircontinuing threat.   ``Global Volcanism 1975-1985'' is largely a scientific treatise,yet within its 672 pages of text, charts and maps are detailed someof the most dramatic events of a decade.   ``An explosive eruption on 13 Nov melted ice and snow in thesummit area, generating lahars that flowed tens of kilometers downflank river valleys, killing more than 22,000 people,'' begins thereport on Nevada del Ruiz, the Colombia volcano that became thefourth deadliest volcano in history.   Lahars, the geological term for massive mudflows generated byvolcanoes, came crashing down 11 narrow valleys into villages,sweeping away or burying the thousands who made their homes andlives there in November of 1985.   ``A frightening noise and then a blast of wind hit us and we sawfire falling from the sky,'' survivor E. Nieto told the scientiststhat day.   Compiled by the Smithsonian Institution, the new volume ispublished by Prentice-Hall and the American Geophysical Union. Itcollects reports from the first 10 years of the Smithsonian'sScientific Event Alert Network. The network is a collection ofthousands of scientists around the world who study volcanoes,earthquakes, meteors and other such events and share their findingswith one another.   With scientific thoroughness, for example, they reported notonly that Nevada del Ruiz ranked fourth in volcano death tolls,they listed the three events that were even worse: Tambora, 1815,92,000 killed; Krakatau, 1883, 36,000 dead; Mt. Pelee, 1902, 28,000fatalities.   One of the editors of the new volume, Tom Simkin, theSmithsonian's curator of petrology and volcanology, co-wrote anearlier volume, ``Krakatau 1883.'' Others who joined in editing andupdating the network reports are Smithsonian researchers LindsayMcClelland, Marjorie Summers, Elizabeth Nielsen and Thomas Stein.   In addition to Nevada del Ruiz, the volume reports in detail onMount St. Helens in Washington, which is better known to Americans.   Its May 1980 explosion claimed more than 50 lives, cost billionsof dollars in damage and cleanup and coated large parts of severalstates with thick, gritty dust for days afterward. The mountainremains active.   The volume notes earthquake activity at thee other Cascade orSierra Nevada volcanoes during the period: Mount Hood, Ore.; MountShasta, Calif., and Long Valley Caldera, Calif.   Alaska gets a full chapter on its own, and Hawaii provides thebulk of activity in the Central Pacific Ocean section.   Among the more than 200 volcanoes reported in the volume are:   _Stromboli, near Sicily, which began a new effusive phase inNovember 1975, continuing a history of more than 2,000 years ofalmost constant activity.   _Etna, the volcano with the longest documented record in theworld, extending back to 1500 B.C. This Sicilian volcano continuedits tradition with several eruptions during the decade.   _Grimsvotn, in Iceland, which erupted in both 1982 and 1983.Located beneath an ice sheet, Grimsvotn melts the ice when iterupts, flooding local streams and in 1983 produced large steamclouds.   _Karkar, off the coast of New Guinea, erupted with an explosiveblast of hot gas and debris March 8, 1979, killing two scientistswho had set up camp to study the volcano.   Robin J.S. Cooke and Elias Ravian died in the blast, just over ayear before Mount St. Helens would kill another volcanologist,David Johnston of the U.S. Geological Survey.</TEXT></DOC>
