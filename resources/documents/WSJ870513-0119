McCoyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LATAM </IN><DATELINE> NASSAU, Bahamas  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Corruption helped sweep Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling into power 20 years ago in this sun-drenched chain of 700 islands. Now, it may finally be about to sweep him out.    Yesterday, Mr. Pindling dissolved Parliament and scheduled an election for June 19. The race will be the fiercest political battle he and his Progressive Liberal Party, or PLP, have faced since 1967, when he helped expose a crooked white-minority government and launched the movement that won independence from Britain and made him a national hero.    Unemployment is high and drug abuse rampant, but the issue that threatens Mr. Pindling most is an old one with a new twist: A corruption scandal simmering for more than three years has boiled over again because of fresh charges that he and other top officials have been on the payrolls of international drug lords.    He denies the accusations. But the flare-up has heaped more pressure on his government and given the Free National Movement, or FNM, the opposition party mainly made up of former Pindling backers from the black middle class, its first real crack at unhorsing the charismatic leader.    Both sides predict landslide victories; most observers rate the race a toss-up. &quot;Pindling and his friends have gone too far, at long last,&quot; says Kendal Isaacs, the FNM's leader who would become prime minister if his party wins. Even some members of Mr. Pindling's party are nervous. &quot;It doesn't look so great at the moment,&quot; acknowledges Arthur Hanna, a PLP member of Parliment and former deputy prime minister, who is frequently at odds with the prime minister.    Though both parties are basically conservative and pro-Western, the elections could put a new spin on the often prickly relations between the U.S. and the Bahamas. Some U.S. officials believe fighting drug smugglers would be easier with Mr. Pindling out of power. A Pindling triumph, many here feel, could signal that corruption has become an officially sanctioned standard procedure in the Bahamas.    About 40% of the cocaine and much of the marijuana pouring into the U.S. comes through the Bahamas, the Drug Enforcement Administration in Washington estimates. U.S. officials say Bahamian cooperation in combating traffickers has improved in recent years, but some grumble that it hasn't improved enough. American officals have been considering whether to take the drastic step of barring some of Mr. Pindling's closest confidants -- including some candidates for Parliament -- from entering the U.S. because of suspected involvement in drug running.    Scandal has been part of the lore of this smuggler's paradise since the days of Blackbeard, but the current corruption mess is setting records for duration and damage. A 1984 report by a government-appointed commission found that dozens of policemen, customs officers and public officials -- some of them Mr. Pindling's closest friends and political allies -- took payoffs from dope smugglers.    The report showed Mr. Pindling spent eight times what he earned as prime minister over a six-year period, but he wasn't linked directly to any bribes. He has branded as &quot;lies&quot; all allegations that he was ever involved with drug traffickers.    Since then, Mr. Pindling has fought off demands for an early election and survived a palace revolt in which five of his 13 cabinet ministers either quit or were fired. (Under Bahamian law, he had to call a national vote by the end of July.)    But he has done little to distance himself from the corruption imbroglio. He recently shocked U.S. officials and some of his own backers by resurrecting two cabinet ministers who were forced to resign in 1984 under a cloud of accusations about their ties to drug traffickers. Both men will run for Parliament with his blessing.    &quot;That is outrageous,&quot; says Mr. Hanna, the PLP member, who some say wants to be prime minister himself. &quot;Mr. Pindling has refused to make himself accountable to the Bahamian people.&quot;    Mr. Pindling, the Bahamas' first black prime minister, apparently has been counting on his popularity to win him a fifth five-year term. The strategy seemed to be working -- until Gorman Bannister showed up in Miami, suffering from cocaine burnout and loose lips.    Mr. Bannister is the son and former business partner of Everette Bannister, a lifelong friend of Mr. Pindling known on the islands as a political fixer. For the past few weeks, U.S. law-enforcement officials say, he has been giving them rich detail on his father's alleged dealings with traffickers. His most serious accusation: Mr. Pindling was the ultimate recipient of some protection money paid by Carlos Lehder, the Colombian cocaine czar who is in federal prison in Atlanta awaiting trial on charges of shipping tons of cocaine into the U.S. from an isolated Bahamian islet.    Mr. Pindling's supporters dismiss the younger Mr. Bannister's stories as ravings. Nonetheless, they have invigorated the FNM's campaign. &quot;We've picked up enough votes since {the 1982 vote} to swing the election,&quot; says Arthur Foulkes, spokesman for the FNM. &quot;The Bahamian people are sick of all this foolishness.&quot;    If graft alone carried much weight in the Bahamas, Mr. Pindling might have been sunk long ago. But other problems are fueling discontent with the government. Though the tourist trade is still booming and the Bahamas' estimated 8% growth in gross domestic product last year was the region's best, unemployment is stuck at roughly 20%.    And a lot of cocaine passing through on its way to America never gets there. The islands appear to be in the grip of a drug epidemic. &quot;Cocaine is wiping out our young people,&quot; says David Allen of the National Drug Council, an anti-drug group partly funded by the government.    In a cramped hut that reeks of sweat and urine in a ragged neighborhood called the Grove, seven ghostly faces hover around a sputtering candle, smoking &quot;cokome&quot; -- powerful, free-base cocaine. This is a &quot;base house,&quot; one of an estimated 100 in Nassau. Kids plunk down as little as 50 cents for a hit.    A red-eyed youth pulls on a ceramic pipe, smoke swirling around his head. Something is wrong. He is yelling, furious -- there's too much noise. &quot;This is serious here, man,&quot; he snarls, quivering hands jabbing the air. &quot;You're not here to talk, you're here to do drugs.&quot; After tense seconds of silence, he turns his attention back to his pipe.    Mr. Pindling's supporters say he's honest and that the opposition harps on the corruption issue because it has nothing else to offer. They credit the prime minister for the country's relative prosperity. &quot;The Bahamian people know Mr. Pindling as a great and honorable leader,&quot; says Sean McWeeney, the PLP's chairman.    Recently, the prime minister has stepped up attacks on drug abuse and dusted off a proposal to boost the economy by developing tourism. In speeches, he rips his critics as &quot;stooges&quot; and &quot;nincompoops,&quot; and says he's committed to working with the U.S. to stem the drug torrent.    Some people think if he wins this time he will be politically invincible. &quot;It would be a tragedy for the nation,&quot; says Eileen Carron, editor of the nation's largest newspaper, the Tribune. &quot;It would signal to undesirables everywhere that the Bahamas is where corruption is accepted, and where honor and integrity do not count.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
