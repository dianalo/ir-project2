We conductedverification in Thailand from December 6-19, 1988, of the questionnaireresponses of the Government of Thailand (GOT), Siam Fittings Co., Ltd.(Siam), Thai Malleable Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. (TM), and BIS Pipe FittingCo., Ltd. (BIS). Respondents submitted a supplemental response to our deficiencyquestionnaire and an amended response clarifying information and correctingcertain minor errors found at verification on December 23, 1988.Petitioner and respondents requested a public hearing in this case. Petitionerand respondents filed pre-hearing briefs on January 18, 1989. A publichearing was held on January 19, 1989. Petitioner and respondents filedpost-hearing briefs on January 26, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The products covered by this investigation are malleable iron pipe fittingsfrom Thailand, advanced in condition by operations or processes subsequentto the casting process, other than with grooves. Malleable iron pipe fittings(pipe fittings), are classified under TSUSA category 610.7400 and underHarmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) category 7307.19.90.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG>For purposes of this final determination, the period for which we are measuringbounties or grants (``the review period'') is calendar year 1987, whichcorresponds to each of the three companies' most recently completed fiscalyear.Based upon our analysis of the petition, the responses to our questionnaire,verification, and written comments filed by petitioner and respondents,we determine the following:I. Programs Determined To Confer Bounties or GrantsWe determine that bounties or grants are being provided to manufacturers,producers and exporters in Thailand of pipe fittings under the followingprograms.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Export Packing Credits</ITAG>Export packing credits (EPCs) are short-term loans used for either pre-shipmentor post-shipment financing. Exporters apply to commercial banks for EPCs.The commercial banks, in turn, must submit an application for approvalto the Bank of Thailand (BOT). Under the ``Regulations Governing the Purchaseof Promissory Notes Arising from Exports'' (B.E. 2528), effective January2, 1986, the BOT repurchases promissory notes issued by creditworthy exportersthrough commercial banks. To qualify for the repurchase arrangement, promissorynotes must be supported by a letter of credit, sales contract, purchaseorder, usance bill or warehouse receipt. The notes are available for upto 180 days, and interest is paid on the due date of the loan rather thanthe date of receipt.At verification we found that, on the due date of the loan, the BOT debitsthe commercial bank's account for the principal amount and the five percentinterest charged the commercial bank. If the terms of the loan are notmet, the BOT charges the commercial bank a penalty, retroactive to thefirst day of the loan, at an eight percent interest rate.Similarly, on the due date of the loan, the commercial bank debits theexporter's account for the principal amount and the seven percent interestcharged the exporter. If the exporter has not met the terms of the loan,the commercial bank passes on the additional eight percent penalty chargeover the term of the loan. The penalty is refunded to the commercial bank by the BOT and by the commercialbank to the exporter if the company can prove shipment of the goods tookplace within 60 days after the due date (in the case of pre-shipment loans),or the foreign currency was received within 60 days after the due date(in the case of post-shipment loans). Otherwise, the penalty is not refunded.The purpose of the penalty charge is to ensure that companies take outEPC loans only to finance actual export sales.On October 1, 1988, the GOT issued new regulations that coexisted withthe prior regulations until December 31, 1988. On January 1, 1989, thenew regulations completely replaced the former ones. Until January 1, 1989,exporters could still receive EPC loans under the terms of the programdescribed above. Under the new regulations, the maximum rate commercialbanks can charge exporters was raised from seven to 10 percent. In addition,the BOT now ony rediscounts up to 50 percent of the loan amount, whereasunder the previous program the BOT could rediscount the full value of theloan.We verified that both TM and Siam received and paid interest on EPC loansfor exports of pipe fittings to the United States during the review periodand that, on the two loans on which penalty payments were charged, thepenalties were refunded. Because only exporters are eligible for theseloans, we determine that they are countervailable to the extent that theyare provided at preferential rates.As the benchmark for short-term loans, it is our practice to use the nationalaverage commercial interest rate on the most comparable, predominant formof short-term financing. For purposes of this determination, we are usingthe weighted-average interest rate charged by commercial banks on domesticloans, bills and overdrafts during 1987, and where loans were issued in1986 but repaid in 1987, the weighted average interest rate of the samecomposition for 1986. This is the benchmark that we have applied in allprevious Thai cases.The data used to calculate these weighted average interest rates was verifiedat the BOT. Comparing the weighted average interest rates for 1986 and1987 to the rate charged on EPCs, we find that the rate on EPCs is preferentialand, therefore, confers bounties or grants on exports of pipe fittings.The calculate the benefit from the EPC loans on which interest was paidduring 1987, we followed the short-term methodology which has been appliedconsistently in our past determinations and is described in more detailin the <T3>Subsidies Appendix </T3>attached to the notice of <T3>Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat-Rolled Products from Argentina: FinalAffirmative Countervailing Duty Determiantion and Countervailing Duty Order</T3>(49 FR 18006, April 26, 1984).We compared the amount of interest actually paid during the review periodto the amount that would have been paid at the benchmark rate. Becausewe verified that EPC loans to companies in this investigation were segregableby destination and product, we inluded only those loans which financedexports of pipe fittings to the United States. We calculated the amountof interest that would have been paid at the benchmark rate and subtractedthe amount of interest that was actually paid. We then divided the resultby the total value of respondents' exports of pipe fittings to the UnitedStates. The estimated net bounty or grant is 0.06 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">B. Tax Certificates for Exports</ITAG>Under the ``Tax and Duty Compensation of Exported Goods Produced in theKingdom Act'' (Tax and Duty Act), the GOT issues tax certificates to exportersof record to rebate indirect taxes and import duties levied on inputs intoexported products. The rebate rates under the Tax and Duty Act are computedon the basis of an input/output (I/O) study initially published in 1980based on 1975 data, and updated in 1985 using 1980 data. Using the I/Ostudy's input structure table, the Thai Ministry of Finance computes thevalue of total inputs (both imports and local purchases) at ex-factoryprices. The Ministry of Finance then calculates two rebate rates: the ``A''and ``B'' rate.The ``A'' rate rebates impoort duties, business and municipal taxes onboth imported and domestically purchased inputs. The ``B'' rate rebatesonly the business and municipal taxes passed through on domestically purchasedinputs, and is used by exporters that receive import duty exemptions ordrawbacks under other programs. The ``A'' or ``B'' rate, as appropriate,is then applied to the total FOB value of exports in the I/O sector, todetermine the amount of the rebate.Under the Tax and Duty Act, the rebates are paid to companies through Taxcertificates which can be used to pay other tax liabilities. These taxcertificates can also be transferred to other companies which can use themto pay their tax liabilities.The rebate rates in effect during the review period were announced on February5, 1986, in the Notification of the Committee on Tax Rebates, No. Or. 1/2529.The calculation of these rates was based on an updated study completedin 1982. For exports of pipe fittings, under Customs Cooperative CouncilNomenclature (CCCN) category 7320.01, the ``A'' rate is 8.11 percent andthe ``B'' rate is 4.98 percent.We verified that all three respondents received tax certificates at the``A'' rate.To determine whether an indirect tax rebate system which incorporates rebatesof import duties confers a bounty or grant, we must apply the followinganalysis. First, we examine whether the system is intended to operate asa rebate of both indirect taxes and import duties. Next, we analyze whetherthe GOT properly ascertained the level of the rebate. This includes a reviewof the sample used in the study, including the documentation and the accuracyof the information gathered from the sample on input coefficients, importprices and rates of duty on imported inputs, the ratio of imported inputsto domestically produced inputs (when, for a given imported input, thereis also domestic production of the input), and the exchange rates usedto convert import prices denominated in a foreign currency to the localcurrency. Finally, we review whether the rebate schedules are revised periodicallyin order to determine if the rebate amount reflects the amount of dutyand indirect taxes paid.When the I/O study upon which the indirect tax and import duty rebate systemis based meets these conditions, the Department will consider that thesystem does not confer a bounty or grant if the amount rebated for dutiesand indirect taxes on physically incorporated inputs does not exceed thefixed amount set in the rebate schedule for the exported product. Whenthe system rebates duties and indirect taxes on both physically incorporatedand non-physically incorporated inputs, we find that a bounty or grantexists to the extent that the fixed rebate exceeds the allowable rebateon physically incorporated inputs.Based on these tests, we determine that the taxes and duties eligible forrebate include those on materials, equipment, spare parts, machinery, fuelsand other energy used in the production of exports. Direct taxes such asincome tax and taxes which are otherwise refundable or exempt are excludedfrom the rebate. Thus, the program operates to rebate indirect taxes andimport duties.The information obtained during verification on the methodology and samplingused in calculating the rebate rates based on the revised I/O study leadsus to conclude that the GOT employed reasonable methodology for adequatelyestablishing the rebate levels. Furthermore, after a thorough examinationof the methodologies employed in revising the 1975 I/O study and in calculatingnew rebate rates based on the revised study, we find that the GOT has asystem in place to periodically update the rebate schedules.Although the rebate under the Tax and Duty Act meets the three conditionsrequired for indirect tax rebate systems not to be considered a bountyor grant, the inputs itemized in the GOT's calculations include both physicallyincorporated items as well as non-physically incorporated items. Sincethe indirect tax on non-physically incorporated items is also includedin the GOT's rebate rate calculation, we must determine the extent to whichthe rebate rates confer an excessive remission of indirect taxes. We havereviewed the documentation and printouts submitted by the GOT in its responseand at verification showing a detailed calculation of the rebate rates.Under the Tax and Duty Act, these calculations itemize the inputs and listex-factory prices, import values, import duties and taxes, and domesticindirect taxes.Based on verified information, we calculated the indirect tax incidenceon physically incorporated inputs at FOB prices according to the most recentgovernment rebate rate calculation. We then subtracted the percentage ofindirect tax incidence attributable to physically incorporated inputs fromthe authorized rebate rate. Using this methodology, the overrebate on the``A'' rate is 1.37 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">C. Electricity Discounts for Exporters</ITAG>The three electricity generating authorities of Thailand, the ElectricityGenerating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the Metropolitan Electricity Authority(MEA), and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA), administer discountson electricity rates charged producers of export products. These discountsrepresent approximately 20 percent of total electricity costs and are availableto any company eligible for and receiving tax certificates.Once the export transaction has been completed, the exporter may applyfor the discount by presenting to the electricity authority from whichit receives its electricity bill the appropriate documents to verify thatan export shipment has been made. The discount is calculated based on therebate rate in effect during that year for that company and appears asa credit on a subsequent electricity bill.We verified that all three respondents applied for and received electricitydiscounts during the review period based on their export shipments. Becausethese electricity discounts are available only to exporters, we determinethat they are countervailable.We allocated the discounts over the total value of respondents' exportssales during the review period to obtain an estimated net bounty or grantof 0.66 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">D. Assistance to Companies Under the Investment Promotion Act (IPA):Tax and Duty Exemption on Imports of Machinery Under Section 28</ITAG>The IPA of 1977 provides incentives for investment to promote developmentof the Thai economy. The Act is administered by the Board of Investment(BOI) through promotion certificates. These certificates list the various``sections'' of the Act under which a company is eligible to receive benefits.The certificates are applied for and granted on a case-by-case basis.We verified that all three respondents received promotion certificates,but that only Siam and BIS received exemptions under section 28 of theIPA during the review period. Section 28 provides exemption from importduties and business taxes on machinery imported by a date specified inthe ``conditions'' section of the certificate. We verified that the otherIPA sections listed in the companies' certificates were not used. Thesesections are discussed below under ``Programs Determined To Be Not Used.''We verified that the certificates were granted to respondents under a categorycreated specifically for export-oriented companies and that receipt ofbenefits in each certificate is contingent on export performance; therefore,we determine that, for purposes of this investigation, benefits receivedunder section 28 are countervailable. The benefit consists of the dutyand tax savings realized as a result of the exemptions.To calculate the estimated net bounty or grant, we allocated the totalamount of exemptions received by BIS and Siam during the review periodover the total value of export sales of all three companies. On this basis,we derived an estimated net bounty or grant of 0.85 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">III. Programs Determined Not to Be Used</ITAG>We determine, based on verified information, that manufacturers, producersand exporters in Thailand of pipe fittings did not apply for, claim orreceive benefits during the review period for exports of pipe fittingsto the United States under the following programs, which were listed inthe <T3>Initiation of Countervailing Duty Investigation: Malleable Iron PipeFittings from Thailand</T3> (53 FR 37014, September 23, 1988):<ITAG tagnum="16">A. Repurchase of Industrial Bills</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">B. Reduced Business Taxes for Producers of Intermediate Goods forExport Industries</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">C. Export Processing Zones</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">D. International Trade Promotion Fund </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">E. Investment Promotion Act (Sections 25, 26, 31, 33, 34, 36 and 37)</ITAG>We verified that each of these IPA sections that were either listed inthe respondents' certificates or alleged by petitioner were not used duringthe review period. For a complete description of these programs, see thePreliminary Determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 1:</T3> Respondents argue that the Department should considera program-wide change for the calculation of benefits under the EPC program.They state that ``these companies may now receive only 50 percent of exportvalue as EPC loans. Having verified these facts, the Department shouldreduce the deposit rate to account for the decrease in the amount of principalthat the Bank of Thailand will rediscount from between 80 and 90 percentto 50 percent.''Petitioner argues that the Department should not consider a program-widechange for two reasons. The first is that the program-wide change was notinstituted prior to the preliminary determination. The second is that theeffects of the changes were not verified.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> At verification, the Department found that, underthe new regulations, commercial banks can loan up to 100 percent of shipmentvalue, as opposed to a maximum of 90 percent under the old regulations.The BOT subsequently rediscounts the loan. Under the old regulations, theBOT rediscounted the full amount of the loan. Under the new regulationsthis amount has been reduced to a maximum of 50 percent of the loan. Consequently,exporters can receive up to 100 percent of the shipment value as a loan.The BOT rediscounts up to 50 percent of that loan, not the shipment value.While it is the Department's practice to take into account verified program-widechanges which occur before the preliminary determination, the effects ofthe new program were not verifiable, nor did the new regulations replacethe old ones prior to the preliminary determination. The new program replacedthe old program on January 1, 1989. Until then, banks provided existingcustomers with loans under the old program. Therefore, respondent's argumentprovides no basis for the Department to consider a program-wide change.<T3>Comment 2:</T3> Respondents argue that the benchmark used to calculatethe benefit arising from the EPC loans obtained in 1986 should be basedon the second half of 1986 rather than the full year. They argue that theEPC loans obtained in 1986 were obtained during the second half of 1986,and that therefore the benchmark for the second half of 1986 would be morerepresentative of the prevailing interest rate, as interest rates fluctuateduring the year.Petitioner argues that there is no evidence of interest rate fluctuationson record, nor is there evidence that the benchmark for the last half of1986 is more representative than the benchmark for the full year.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> In calculating benefits from short-term loans, theDepartment uses the most appropriate full year national average short-termfinancing rate. The Department found no evidence of significant fluctuationsin interest rates (as it did in <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations and CountervailingDuty Orders: Certain Welded Carbon Steel Pipe and Tube Products from Argentina,</T3>53 FR 37619, September 27, 1988) that would warrant using a half-year benchmark.Furthermore, there is no evidence that the calculated benchmark for a fullyear is an inaccurate measure of the interest rates on short-term loans.Therefore, we used the benchmark for the full year.<T3>Comment 3:</T3> Respondents argue that the Department should take intoaccount the interest foregone due to the payment of penalty interest whichwas subsequently refunded. They state that the foregone interest constitutesthe lost use of capital which is a real cost to the company rather thanan impermissible offset.Petitioner quotes section 771(6) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (the Act) (19U.S.C. 1677(6)) to support his argument that foregone interest is not considereda permissible offset. Moreover, petitioner argues that the lost incomeconstitutes a secondary economic effect which the Department has consistently``refused to treat,'' as in <T3>Oil Country Tubular Goods from Canada </T3>(51 FR 15037, April 22,1986).<T3>DOC Position:</T3> Respondents submitted a calculation of the foregoneinterest on the two loans for shipments of pipe fittings to the UnitedStates on which penalties were assessed and then refunded. They have notdemonstrated that their proposed calculation would have any effect on thebounty or grant rate. Even if we accept respondents' calculations, thedifference between the present country-wide rate for the EPC program andthe country-wide rate for this program incorporating the foregone interestwould be 0.000009 percent. We therefore believe it is unnecessary to considerwhether any foregone interest should be taken into account in calculatingthe interest rate on EPCs.<T3>Comment 4:</T3> Petitioner argues that pipe fittings are not considered``secondary steel products,'' the input/output (``I/O'') sector in whichthe National Economic and Social Development Board (``NESDB'') has classifiedthem (I/O sector 106). Rather, they should be categorized in the sectorproviding for ``other fabricated metal products'' (I/O sector 111), thedescription of which specifically mentions pipe fittings. Petitioner statesthat this misclassification proves that the I/O study fails the linkagetest.Respondents argue that the validity of the I/O study was verified at boththe NESDB and the Ministry of Finance. They state that the Department verifiedthat the tariff category covering pipe fittings, 7320.01, was originallyassigned to sector 106. Therefore, pipe fittings are ``properly classified''within sector 106. Furthermore, respondents state that the Department verifiedthat pipe fittings were not provided for under sector 111.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The I/O study is a macroeconomic study and has beenaccepted in all previous Thai cases, most recently in <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and CountervailingDuty Order: Certain Steel Wire Nails from Thailand </T3>(<T3>Thai Nails</T3>) (52 FR 36987, October 2, 1987). The Department verifiedthe classifications done by the NESDB in conjunction with the JapaneseInstitute for Developing Economies. The correlation between the Customscategories and the I/O sectors showed that pipe fittings are classifiedunder sector 106. Therefore, the Department accepted the validity of theI/O study to assess the extent to which overrebates were given under theTax Certificates for Exports program. <T3>Comment 5: </T3>Petitioner argues that pipe fittings are not packagedfor sale in the domestic market and that packing materials should thereforenot be considered physically incorporated for purposes of calculating theallowable rebate under this program. Petitioner further states that theinclusion of packing materials as physically incorporated into the exportedproduct is determined on a case-by-case basis, citing <T3>Potassium Permanganate from Spain </T3>(47 FR 5924, February 9, 1982). Respondents argue that packing materials should be allowed based on theprinciple of tax neutrality. Furthermore, they argue that pipe fittingsdestined for export markets are packaged according to the methods describedin the verification reports. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>In accordance with item (h) of the IllustrativeList of the Subsidies Code, the Department considers the excessive exemption,remission or deferral of indirect taxes to be a subsidy. To determine whetheror not the exemption, remission or deferral of indirect taxes on inputswhich are paid at a prior stage of production is excessive the Departmentapplies the physical incorporation test. (See also Annex 1, paragraph 1to 19 CFR Part 355). As petitioner notes, a determination of whether aninput is physically incorporated must be made on a case-by-case basis.Here, as in previous cases, the packing materials become a part of themanufactured product when made ready for export, and thus are consideredto be physically incorporated into the product that is imported into theUnited States. We have consistently considered packing materials to bephysically incorporated into products under investigation for purposesof determining whether rebates of indirect taxes are countervailable. (See,for example, <T3>Thai Nails.</T3>) The fact that pipe fittings are not packaged fordomestic sale is irrelevant to this determination. <T3>Comment 6: </T3>Petitioner argues that aluminum chloride and zinc chloride,claimed as ``basic chemicals'' by respondents, are not physically incorporatedin pipe fittings. Rather, the chemicals are used as ``drossing agents''and do not become part of the finished pipe fitting. Furthermore, petitionerstates that the I/O sector for ``basic chemicals'' does not provide foraluminum chloride and zinc chloride, and that the presence is solely dueto the use of scrap steel as a source of iron. Respondents argue both aluminum chloride and zinc chloride are used inthe composition of flux, which is physically incorporated into the pipefitting. Flux coats the pipe fitting and acts as a bonding agent in thegalvanizing process. Therefore, repondents claim that ``basic chemicals''should be considered as physically incorporated. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department has verified that aluminum chlorideand zinc chloride are used in the composition of flux, which is physicallyincorporated into pipe fittings during the galvanizing process. Becausethere chemicals are classified in the ``basic chemicals'' I/O sector, wedetermine that the tax incidence on this I/O sector is allowable. <T3>Comment 7: </T3>Petitioner argues that the subsidy conferred by electricityrebates should be tied to export sales of the pipe fittings to the UnitedStates because applications for discounts contain shipment-specific information.Petitioner also argues that the duty deposit rate should be calculatedusing the rebates obtained for the first half of 1988. Petitioner arguesthat the discounts obtained during the first half of 1988 would be morerepresentative than the discounts received in 1987 because they would bemore likely to include discounts received for 1987 shipments and wouldlikely be more representative of the upward trend in electricity consumptionand rebates. Respondents argue that the Department acknowledged that the administrationof the program precludes the tying of electricity discounts to specificshipments. They also state that, absent any program-wide change, the Departmentshould base its calculations on the review period and should use verifiedinformation consisting of electricity discounts received in 1987. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with respondents' arguments. Although applicationscontain shipment-specific information, individual discounts can be basedon several shipments of various products to different destinations. Inaddition, the administration of the program is such that there are varyinglag times between the application for the discount and the actual receiptof the discount. Since there was no program-wide change in the electricitydiscounts program, it would be inappropriate to use discounts receivedafter the review period in the calculation of the duty deposit rate. Accordingly,we used the total value of electricity discounts received during the reviewperiod to calculate the benefit conferred by this program.<T3>Comment 8: </T3>Respondents argue that the import duty and businesstax exemptions on machinery under section 28 of the IPA are available toThai companies in a broad range of industries and are not limited to exporters.Therefore, the Department should not consider exemptions received undersection 28 of the IPA countervailable. Petitioner argues that the BOI promotion certificates were awarded to respondentscontingent on their export performance. The companies that received exemptionsunder section 28 of the IPA during the review period had specific exportrequirements in their certificates. Therefore, petitioner argues, section28 of the IPA is countervailable as an export subsidy. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department verified that the two companies thatreceived exemptions under section 28 of the IPA were granted certificatesunder a category created specifically for export-oriented companies. Furthermore,BOI certificates are granted on a company-by-company basis and list specificconditions for receipt of benefits. The respondents received certificatespredicated on their performance. Therefore, we agree with petitioner'sarguments that the exemptions received by respondents are countervailableas an export subsidy. <T3>Comment 9: </T3>Respondents argue that if section 28 of the IPA isconsidered countervailable, the benefit should be calculated using onlythose pieces of machinery on which the cash effect of the duty exemptionwas realized during the review period. This would exclude duty exemptionon two pieces of equipment on which partial exemption was received. Bondsfor these items were posted during the review period but duty paymentswere finalized in 1988.Petitioner argues that the two pieces of equipment on which duties werefinalized in 1988 should be included in the calculation of the benefit.Petitioner suggests that the deferred duty payment ``must be countervailedas an interest-free loan whose principal equals the amount of the deferredduties.'' The duty exemption itself should be considered as a grant. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The Department verified that permission for partialduty exemption from the BOI for the two pieces of equipment in questionwas received in 1988. Even though they had applied for the exemption in1987, the respondents did not know whether they would receive an exemptionuntil 1988. Therefore, the benefit on these two pieces of machinery wasrealized in 1988, outside the review period. To calculate the benefit onthe Section 28 program, we included only those imports on which dutieswere exempted during the review period. <T3>Comment 10: </T3>Respondents argue that the Department should baseits calculation on the benefits received by the companies under section28 of the IPA in 1988. They claim that this value would ``correspond moreclosely to the eventual duty liability.''<T3>DOC Position: </T3>As previously mentioned, absent any program-widechange, it is the Department's practice to calculate the duty deposit ratebased on the benefits received during the review period. <T3>Comment 11: </T3>Respondents argue that the Department must make anadjustment to the antidumping duty deposit rate for the rate of subsidizationfound in this investigation. Respondents further submit that the adjustmentshould be made retroactive to the preliminary countervailing duty determination.The reason for the retroactive adjustment is that if an antidumping dutyreview is not requested, the cash deposit rate applicable in the dumpingcase will become the assessment rate, and a violation of the GATT's prohibitionagainst double assessment duties attributable to export subsidies willresult. Petitioner argues that the assessment should not be made retroactivelybecause ``the potential for a violation of the GATT arises only if respondentsfail to pursue their rights under U.S. law'' by not requesting a review.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We have determined that the Department does nothave the authority to adjust the amount of antidumping duties paid on productsunder investigation within the context of this countervailing duty investigation,and that any adjustment as requested by respondents must be made withinthe context of the antidumping duty order. <ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>In accordance with section 776(b) of the Act, we verified the informationused in making our final determination. During verification, we followedstandard verification procedures, including meeting with government andcompany officials, inspecting documents and ledgers, tracing informationin the response to source documents, accounting ledgers, and financialstatements, and collecting additional information that we deemed necessaryfor making our final determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>We are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidationon all entries of malleable iron pipe fittings from Thailand which areentered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the dateof publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>In accordance with section 706(a) of the Act(19 U.S.C. 1671e), we are directing the U.S. Customs Service to requirea cash deposit equal to 2.94 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for each entry of the subject merchandise.This determination is published pursuant to section 705(d) of the Act [19U.S.C. 1671d(d)].<ITAG tagnum="6">Jan W.
