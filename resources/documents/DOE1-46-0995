A life table risk assessmentmodel was then developed to estimate the excess cases of cancer and lostperson-years of life likely to occur among those occupationally and nonoccupationallyexposed to the nine asbestos product categories manufactured in 1985-2000.These estimates were made under the assumption that government regulationremains at its 1985 level. Use of asbestos in the nine product categorieswas predicted to decline in all cases except for friction products. Therisk assessment results show that, although the cancer risks from futureexposure to asbestos are significantly less than those from past exposures,in the absence of more stringent regulations, a health risk remains.</TEXT></DOC>
