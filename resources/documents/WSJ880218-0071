Miller </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CAUT </CO><IN> HRD STK EDP </IN><TEXT>   Computer Automation Inc. is an obscure, thinly traded California company that has been plunged into a patent controversy in the fractious personal computer market.    At issue is a Computer Automation design that International Business Machines Corp. quietly arranged to use inside its new line of personal computers, the PS/2. Now Computer Automation claims dozens of makers of IBM clones and accessories need to license the same design.    When the controversy plays out, some analysts say, Computer Automation could earn a sizable stream of cash. Henry Swift andamp; Co., a small San Francisco brokerage, thinks Computer Automation will get a profit windfall of more than $3 million a year after taxes -- a big number for a company that earned $1.4 million, or 66 cents a share, in its year ended June 30, 1987.    The few other people who follow Computer Automation have also nurtured extravagant hopes since the patent controversy started to unfold. Michael Murphy, editor of California Technology Stock Letter, thinks the stock is worth more than $20, much higher than its closing price yesterday of 11 7/8, up 1/8.    But betting on this potential windfall carries huge risks. There's some dispute about how broad Computer Automation's patent rights really are. The company's price-earnings multiple, already hefty, could make it vulnerable to disappointment. And even if the company's claims are valid, it may face a long, expensive legal battle with clone companies.    Another risk is the uncertain future of PS/2 clones. IBM has warned that its PS/ 2 machines are full of its own proprietary technology, and cloners might avoid the market for fear of crushing lawsuits.    A maker of test equipment and computers, the Irvine, Calif.-based concern stirred interest last spring when it announced it had licensed an unspecified patent to IBM for $100,000.    Rumors circulated about the patent last year, but information was scarce until Computer Automation last month made a second announcement. It said the patent covered a memory process used inside the top models of the PS/2 line, and said IBM would pay the firm an undisclosed royalty on sales of those models. It claimed it would be impossible to clone those PS/2s or to build add-on memory boards for them without infringing the patent.    Asked about those claims, IBM issued a carefully worded statement that cast doubts on the second assertion. &quot;We believe it's possible to add memory to the Personal System/2 and not infringe&quot; Computer Automation's patent, IBM said. Keep in mind that IBM wants to encourage add-on board makers, who help make PS/2s more useful, and to discourage clone makers, who would take a bite out of sales.    Here's how Mr. Murphy calculates the bonanza that he predicts Computer Automation will reap. He guesses its royalty from IBM is 50 cents to $1 per PS/2, and estimates that will bring in $1.1 million in 1988. The company is demanding $1 to $26 per unit in royalties from other companies, Mr. Murphy says. He figures the average royalty per clone would be $10 and predicts half a million clones will sell this year, bringing in another $5 million.    Mr. Murphy lops off about half for legal expenses, overhead and taxes. Computer Automation has only 2.3 million shares outstanding, so that amounts to more than $1.30 a share in extra earnings from the patent.    Computer Automation won't comment on those estimates. Ira Robinson, Computer Automation's general counsel, said yesterday the company doesn't yet have any definite licensees besides IBM.    Computer Automation's stock rose 33% to $12 on its January announcement. Since then, it has hovered between $10 and $13. Mr. Murphy thinks the stock could rise as much as $10, which would give the company a market valuation of about $50 million. &quot;Paying $50 million to own this patent is probably a sensible business decision,&quot; he says.    Some others on Wall Street are intrigued by Computer Automation. &quot;I suspect we should take them seriously,&quot; says Richard Whittington, a Prudential-Bache semiconductor analyst. A Henry Swift analyst expects the patent could translate into $1.50 a share in extra annual earnings.    Such bets on the murky workings of high-technology intellectual property law take guts. It wouldn't be surprising for Computer Automation's patent claims to be mired in a long legal fight that would quickly strain the company's finances.    Quadram, a Georgia-based accessory maker, already maintains its PS/2 memory boards don't violate Computer Automation's patent. And Ron Laurie, a lawyer for clone-supplier Chips andamp; Technologies, says he has tentatively concluded his client has a way around the patent. &quot;Patents cannot be ignored these days -- they are being upheld more and more,&quot; he says. &quot;But most companies would rather pay their lawyers than their competitors.&quot;    ---   Computer Automation   (OTC; Symbol: CAUT)   Business: Test equipment and computers   Year ended June 30, 1987:   Revenue: $20.9 million   Net income: $1.4 million; 66 cents a share   Second quarter, Dec. 31, 1987:   Per-share earnings: 12 cents vs. 15 cents   Average daily trading volume:   39,743 shares   Common shares outstanding: 2.1 million</TEXT></DOC>
