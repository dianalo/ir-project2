Researchers at Xerox's Silicon Valley laboratories aredevising prototype computers that seek to mimic low-techtools such as note pads and blackboards. Xerox argues thatthese mundane items have proven the most efficient tools forgetting the job done.   For starters, Xerox says it has built a prototype the sizeof a pad of Post-it notes, with a liquid crystal screen onwhich the user writes text. The pad includes a transmitterthat can zap the writing to other computer tablets ranging insize from the notes to legal pads and blackboards.   In Xerox's futuristic vision, which it calls &quot;ubiquitouscomputing,&quot; an average executive in the mid-1990s would havea dozen note-sized computers scattered around the office forquick memos. Legal-pad-sized machines would be stacked ondesks and in conference rooms for note-taking and financialcalculations. The desktop machine would still be there, Xeroxsays, but many of its functions would be usurped by theinexpensive paper-mimicking computers. &quot;We're taking life asit is and computerizing it,&quot; says a Xerox research manager.   Rapidly shrinking computer chips and recent advances inhandwriting recognition from companies such as Tandy's GridSystems unit lend some credence to Xerox's model. Moreover,Xerox's lab, where engineers and sociologists gaze intocrystal balls together, has been right before. In themid-1970s, it came up with ideas that eventually made theirway into the Apple Macintosh.                                                                                                          Weather Nuts With PCs   Can Chart Fronts Galore                                                                                                          WHO NEEDS the evening news weatherman when a meteorologistlurks in every personal computer?   A modem and a piece of software turn a PC into a weathermachine that phones up a central weather-data computer andtranslates the data into weather maps and charts on thescreen. One such program, WeatherBrief from the Mindscapeunit of Software Toolworks, Chatsworth, Calif., dials up aweather computer in Salt Lake City used by newspapers and TVforecasters.   To save phone charges, the $50 program prompts the user totype out a shopping list of weather information ahead oftime. The program automatically dials up, obtains data, hangsup and converts numbers into charts and maps.   One day in July, for instance, a $1.98 phone call usingthe program showed a 37% chance of rain in Oklahoma City,soil temperature of 69 degrees in Chicago and 117-degree heatin Kuwait. The call also generated computer maps of weatherfronts, cloud cover, lightning strikes and a satellite photoof hurricanes Hernan and Iselle just off Mexico.   Another Software Toolworks program, Accu-WeatherForecaster, lets PCs dial into AccuWeather's database tocreate graphs and maps. One feature creates a &quot;window&quot; on thescreen that simulates the weather as seen out the window atany of 1,000 weather stations. Users of the $80 programinclude transportation firms, &quot;weather hobbyists&quot; andnudists, the company says.                                                                                                          Tiny Gadgets Measure   Cholesterol at Home                                                                                                          CONSUMERS soon will be able to stay up to the minute ontheir cholesterol readings.   MediSense, Cambridge, Mass., is designing pen-sizedgadgets that let users measure their own cholesterol levelsmuch as diabetics measure their blood glucose. Until now,cholesterol testing required technicians using expensivetypewriter-sized lab machines. MediSense's testers, which itplans to unveil as early as next year probably for less than$200, use &quot;biosensors&quot; -- electrodes that combine electronicsand an organic material ferrocene -- to measure cholesterol.   MediSense won't discuss details of its pens, which stillneed regulatory approval. But it says the gadget will shrinkthe innards of a bigger model -- the size of a deskcalculator -- that it will place in pharmacies this fall. &quot;Aperson picking up toothpaste can get his cholesterol checkedright on the spot,&quot; a MediSense official says.   With both models, a customer uses a disposablefinger-pricking device and places a blood drop on thebiosensor embedded in a paper strip. The blood's cholesterolmolecules react with chemicals in the paper, creating a faintcurrent that the sensor measures in about 20 seconds,compared with the five minutes needed by conventionalequipment.   The tester meets federal guidlines for accuracy, saysMediSense, which hopes for a replay of the success of itspen-sized testing devices used by diabetics. The company alsosays it's studying uses of biosensors to test blood levels ofdrugs and alcohol.   Typists Sick of `Mice'   Get a Reprieve From `J'                                                                                                          HERE'S RELIEF for mouse haters.   Accomplished touch-typists often dislike the computer&quot;mouse&quot; -- the device that is rolled around on the desktop tomanipulate the screen's pointer -- because a hand on themouse means a hand off the keyboard. Home Row, Clackamas,Ore., has a tiny gadget that converts the keyboard's &quot;J&quot; keyinto a surrogate mouse when the typist holds down the &quot;alt&quot;key.   The typist pushes the J slightly forward, backward orsideways, and a &quot;force sensor&quot; hiding under the key's capdetects the movement and translates it into a cursormovement. Releasing the alt key returns the J to normal.   Home Row has licensed its technology to keyboard maker KeyTronic, Spokane, Wash., which says it expects a market amonglaptop-computer makers.</TEXT></DOC>
