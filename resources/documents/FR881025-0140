The periodicpublication of these theft data does not have any effect on the obligationsof regulated parties under the Cost Savings Act. These theft data for yearsafter 1984 serve only to inform the public of the extent of the motor vehicletheft problem. NHTSA has previously published 1986 theft data for publicreview and comment. After evaluating those public comments, the agencyhas made some minor changes to the previously published 1986 data. Thisnotice informs the public of those minor changes and of this agency's finalcalculations of 1986 theft data.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Ms. Barbara Kurtz, Office of MarketIncentives, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC, 20590 (202 366-4808).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>NHTSA has promulgated a Federal motorvehicle theft prevention standard at 49 CFR Part 541. This standard appliesto cars that are in lines designated as ``high theft lines.'' Whether ornot a car line is a high theft line depends on the relationship of theline's actual or likely theft rate to the median theft rate for car linesin 1983 and 1984. Section 603(b)(3) of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C.2023(b)(3)) sets forth the steps NHTSA had to follow in making its determinationof the median theft rate for 1983 and 1984. The agency followed those steps,published final theft data for the 1983 and 1984 car lines, and made adetermination of the median theft rate for those years. <T3>See </T3>50 FR 46666; November 12, 1985.Section 603(b)(3) of the Cost Savings Act also provides that NHTSA shall``periodically'' publish later calendar years' theft data for public reviewand comment. These publications of theft data for subsequent model yearshave no effect on the determination of whether a car line is or shouldbe subject to the requirements of the theft prevention standard. The agencybelieves that the reason Congress directed it to periodically publish theftdata for later years was to inform the public, particularly law enforcementgroups, automobile manufacturers, and the Congress, of the extent of thevehicle theft problem and the impact, if any, on vehicle thefts of theFederal motor vehicle theft prevention standard.To accomplish this purpose, NHTSA published for public review and commentsthe theft rates for 1986 on May 2, 1988 (53 FR 15610). NHTSA received threecomments on the 1986 theft data, all of which were submitted by vehiclemanufacturers.Ford commented that the May 1988 publication did not include the theftrates of the 1986 Mercury Sable or Ford Taurus car lines. Ford is correctin that the Mercury Sable and Ford Taurus car lines were inadvertentlynot included in the 1986 theft rate listing. The 1986 theft rate listinghas been corrected to include these two car lines.General Motors (GM) informed the agency that it was appropriate in thepast to report the Oldsmobile Delta 88 and Custom Cruiser car lines combinedas one car line. But beginning with the 1986 model year, they are two separatecar lines and should, therefore, be reported as separate entries. GM alsoinformed the agency that the Buick LeSabre/Electra Estate Wagons are separatecar lines from the Buick Electra and LeSabre. The LeSabre/Electra EstateWagons are real wheel drive ``B'' cars and are available only as 4-doorstation wagons.The 1986 theft rates have been edited to reflect all of GM's comments.The Oldsmobile Delta 88 and Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser are listed as separatecar lines and the Buick LeSabre/Electra Estate Wagons are also listed asseparate carlines. The Estate Wagon thefts were subtracted from the BuickLeSabre and Electra and the production figures remained the same as reportedby the manufacturer.Volkswagen of America, Inc., (Volkswagen) commented that the Audi Quattrocar line was discontinued in the 1985 model year. However, the Audi 4000and Audi 5000 each have a Quattro series that was continued in 1986. Therefore,the Audi Quattro thefts and production numbers should not be included inthe theft rate listing as a separate car line, but with the appropriateAudi 4000 or 5000 car line. In addition, Volkswagen informed the agencythat the Audi 4000/coupe production total in the theft rate list is 400units less than the correct number reported in the final 1986 CorporateAverage Fuel Economy report (CAFE).The agency has corrected the theft rate listing to include the Audi Quattrothefts and production numbers with the appropriate Audi 4000 or Audi 5000car line. The production number total for the Audi 4000/coupe has alsobeen corrected to include the 400 units as reported in the final 1986 CAFEreport. In reporting production figures for developing theft rates, theagency uses the number in the mid-year CAFE reports that all manufacturersare required to provide to the agency. These reports are preliminary andare, therefore not as accurate as the final CAFE reports required to besubmitted to the Environmental Protection Agency.In addition to the above changes, the 1986 theft rate listing was alsorecalculated to reflect new theft data. Specifically, the May 2, 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication listed the Isuzu I-Mark with zerothefts and 31,201 cars produced. After intensive research, it was discoveredthat the vehicle identification number (VIN) decoding systems suppliedby the National Automobile Theft Bureau and the Highway Loss Data Institutewere inaccurate for the model year (MY) 1986 I-Mark. Corrections were made,and the theft data supplied by the National Crime Information Center (NCIC)were reevaluated. There were 141 thefts reported for the MY 1986 I-Markin calendar year 1986, making the theft rate 4.5191. Additionally, theSuzuki Forsa listed zero thefts with 10,971 cars produced. Contact withthe manufacturer provided the accurate VIN. This was applied to the NCICdata tape. Accordingly, the MY 1986 Suzuki Forsa had 76 thefts in calendaryear 1986, making the theft rate 6.9274. Neither Isuzu or Suzuki questionedthe zero thefts for their respective car lines.The following list represents NHTSA's calculation of theft rates for all1986 car lines. As noted above, this list is only intended to inform thepublic of 1986 motor vehicle theft experience, and does not have any effecton the obligations of regulated parties under the Cost Savings Act.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 15 U.S.C. 2023; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on October 20, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Diane K.
