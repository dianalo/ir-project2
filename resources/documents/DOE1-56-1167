The starting concentrations of bromate, bromide,catalyst, and malonic acid were varied in order to obtain 'concentrationcodes' of such series. These represent the dependence of any parametersin discrete ranges of the starting concentrations of the different components.Particularly adequate for a model check are the mechanistic codes (=MCC's) which concern the shape index and the reaction type index: Ifthese mechanistic coordinates remain constant in such a concentrationinterval, other data, e.g. activation energies, can be attributed toa rate-determining process. - The results led to a nine-step model whichis based on the FKN mechanism and is capable of roughly reproducing theinfluence of the initial concentrations and heating rate on 11 parameterscharacteristic of the envelope and of the oscillations of the experimentalsignals. The MCC's of the experimental and theoretical series are similar,revealing 4-5 rate-determining steps in the different concentration ranges.- The activation energies agree with values from the literature, citedfor three steps; these and further resulting activation energies areconsistent with our studies with subsystems.</TEXT></DOC>
