Soldiers shot to death an Arab woman and wounded anotherPalestinian during protests today in the Gaza Strip, hospitalofficials said.   A new wave of violence was unleashed by the assassinationSaturday of PLO leader Khalil al-Wazir. Israeli sources said theattack in a Tunis suburb was carried out by the Israeli Mossadintelligence service, the navy and an elite commando unit.   Official sources in Tunis said today a Tunisian inquiry intoal-Wazir's killing has concluded the operation was conducted byIsrael. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.   Al-Wazir, 52, also called Abu Jihad, was the most seniorPalestine Liberation Organization official assassinated sinceFatah, the largest guerrilla group in the PLO, was founded in 1964.He was PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's closest aide and supervisedmilitary operations inside the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.   Senior PLO officials in Jordan said today that al-Wazir'sfuneral would take place in Syria _ not in Jordan as originallyannounced. Al-Wazir's 80-year-old father, Ibrahim, said his son'sbody will arrive in Damascus early Tuesday and the funeral would bethat night at the Yarmouk refugee camp on the outskirts of thecapital.   In the Gaza Strip, where al-Wazir grew up, a 30-year-oldPalestinian woman, Aidah Othman Totah, died today after being shotin the back, officials at Gaza's Ahli Arab Hospital said. Herrelatives told hospital officials she was shot after refusing toremove burning tires and stones from a street in central Gaza City.   The army said it was checking the report.   Hospital officials also said Mohammed Ateyah Ghaban, 21, wasshot and wounded in his left leg as he and other youths set tiresablaze, a common form of protest against 21 years of Israelioccupation.   However, the territories remained quieter than on Saturday, when17 Palestinians died in the bloodiest day of rioting in 4{ monthsof unrest.   Arab reports said Israeli troops shot and wounded ninePalestinians Sunday. The army confirmed two wounded.   Journalists and non-residents were barred from major roadwaysand towns after the army declared them closed military areas, anarmy spokeswoman said. A curfew began Sunday and continued todayfor about 400,000 Palestinians living in towns and refugee camps inthe occupied lands.   The army spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidabout 15 of the 19 refugee camps in the West Bank were undercurfew, requiring residents to stay indoors indefinitely. Alsounder curfew was the town of Anabta and Nablus, the large city inthe West Bank with 120,000 residents.   In the Gaza Strip, an Arab journalist said six of eight refugeecamps and one village were under curfew. Burning tires dottedstreets in Gaza City, and most people stayed inside, honoring a PLOcall for three days of mourning for al-Wazir.   Graffiti on a wall in Gaza City said: ``Revenge on the Mossadfor killing Abu Jihad,'' the code name of al-Wazir.   In the West Bank camp of Jelazoun, Israeli soldiers turned backa U.N. convoy carrying food and other supplies on Sunday, despitecomplaints of severe shortages during a 33-day curfew. An Israelisoldier guarding the camp told U.N. officials their convoy posed asecurity threat.   At least 166 Palestinians have been killed since the Palestinianuprising began Dec. 8. An Israeli soldier and an Israeli settleralso have been slain.   Palestinian leaders declared three days of mourning beginningSaturday for al-Wazir. Black flags and green, red, black and whitePalestinian flags fluttered over the roofs of houses throughout theoccupied lands on Sunday.   On Sunday, most of the 100,000 Palestinians working in Israelstayed away from their jobs, merchants kept their stores shutteredand drivers attached black ribbons to the antennas of their cars.   Thousands of Palestinians filed into mosques to usher in theholy Moslem month of Ramadan and attend memorial services for theslain commander.   The Palestinians blamed Israel for the assassination.   ``All the people in the occupied areas and outside ... areextremely shocked by the assassination,'' said Faiz Abu Rahmeh,al-Wazir's cousin and a leader of the Gaza Strip's 650,000Palestinians.   Several army officers and Israelis who were victims of guerrillaattacks planned by al-Wazir said they were pleased the Palestiniancommander was dead.   ``Something great has happened, I have closed a circle and I'mhappy,'' the daily Hadashot quoted Eli Ben Yair as saying. BenYair's wife was one of three people killed after Fatah guerrillashijacked a bus near Beersheva on March 7.   Israeli leaders refused to comment on the assassination. Israelradio quoted Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir as telling Cabinetministers he heard about the attack on the radio.   But sources confirmed it was an Israeli operation, carried outjointly by the Mossad, the navy and an elite commando unit. Theysaid it had been postponed several times before Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
