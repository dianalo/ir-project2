In the software maintenancephase, considerable flow information is used by software maintenancetools, such as control flow analyzer, data flow analyzer, data flow anomalydetector, program slicer, and logical and performance ripple effect analyzers.With the aid of a knowledge-based system, generation and analysis offlow information could be treated in the same way. Therefore, a unifiedflow information retrieval and analyzing system could be developed faster,more economically and maintainable. Furthermore, other applications,such as to display the relations between two modules, or to list themodules which share the same specific resources, can be set up quicklyby adding new rules to the knowledge-based system.</TEXT></DOC>
