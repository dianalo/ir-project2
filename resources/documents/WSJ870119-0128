While there is no question that monetary policy has some influence on the prices of primary commodities, the link between oil prices and gold prices is not very strong. Indeed, a review of supply and demand trends in oil markets provides far more insight into past price movements -- as well as a better basis for future price forecasting.    As Mr. Bartley's numbers show, the ratio of the price of an ounce of gold to the price of a barrel of oil fluctuated wildly in the recent past, ranging from 26 barrels in 1973 to eight barrels in 1976, a difference of more than 250%. There is also little evidence that gold prices foreshadow oil price movements. Mr. Bartley notes that the 1973 oil price increase was preceded by a buildup in monetary reserves and a rise in the price of gold. But there was no important decline in the price of gold nor in the level of monetary reserves preceding the recent oil price collapse. On the basis of Mr. Bartley's argument, one might have anticipated a period of price stability since, prior to the price decline, the gold/oil ratio was in the 12 to 14 range that he believes represents a sort of equilibrium.    A look at the trends in the supply and demand for oil is a good deal more enlightening. Monetary policy does play a role here -- since the level of economic activity (and thus, the demand for oil) is obviously affected by interest rates. However, several other factors, such as the pace of conservation, the level of non-OPEC supply, and the willingness of Saudi Arabia to maintain production at low levels, are also critical and are only loosely related to monetary policy.    Certainly, no industry executive should take solace in the &quot;note of hope&quot; represented by the relatively high current price of gold relative to oil and the subsequent speculation that this could lead to an oil price rise. At present there is good reason to believe that the factors mentioned above are pushing against an increase in the price of oil in the next two to three years. The industry would be wise to anticipate continued low crude oil prices that will drag down exploration and production profitability. Combined with the almost inevitable shrinking of refining and marketing margins, this is likely to place even the major oil companies under severe competitive pressure. Current strategies may have to be altered -- perhaps by steps such as withdrawals from key parts of the business, or redirection of exploration and production spending toward areas outside the U.S. The need for such a rethinking of oil company strategies has never been more pressing. And this need would remain even if the Bretton Woods agreement were resurrected tomorrow.

But let us suppose it was meant seriously. Shades of bimetallism! The notion of a &quot;natural&quot; ratio (e.g., 15 to 1) between the prices of gold and silver was ill-conceived when both were used as monetary standards. Substitute oil for silver. The idea that there is a &quot;natural&quot; ratio between the prices of two wholly unrelated commodities -- gold and oil -- is something only a true gold bug would entertain. For all others, it is entertaining -- i.e., amusing.    Bruce C. Netschert   Vice President   National Economic   Research Associates Inc.

It offends countries like Venezuela, which is a member of OPEC and which, during the Arab oil embargo (OAPEC), increased its production to offset the U.S. shortage.    E.B.
