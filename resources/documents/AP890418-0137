In rebuttal, defense attorney Brendan Sullivan declared thatanyone ``who links Colonel North to Adolf Hitler is not credibleand should not be believed.'' He called the comparison outrageous.   ``This man is not Adolf Hitler,'' Sullivan said, ``and hedoesn't do things like Adolf Hitler.''   ``In this case, the government is off track and running wild,and you should stop it,'' he told the jurors, who are expected tobegin deliberating Thursday.   Keker also contended that North, a former White House aide,tried to clear himself of charges by claiming ``the devil made medo it.''   North ``blames other people. `McFarlane made me to it. Caseytold me to do it,''' he said. William Casey was CIA director at thetime.   Keker also called North ``the Joe Isuzu of government'' forallegedly telling lies to the attorney general in November 1986 asthe Iran-Contra affair was erupting.   Isuzu is a character in an television auto commercial who liesoutrageously.   Continuing his assault, Keker suggested that North stole moneyto help pay for a family car.   North is accused of 12 criminal charges, including obstructingCongress and making false statements to Congress and the attorneygeneral. They focus on an alleged attempt to cover up variousaspects of a secret Reagan administration operation to aid theContra rebels in Nicaragua when Congress banned U.S. aid.   Conviction on all counts carries up to 60 years in prison and $3million in fines.   ``The tragedy of Oliver North is that the man who cared so muchfor freedom in Nicaragua forgot about the demands of freedom ...here at home,'' said Keker.   He said that if North had looked up when he went into the Nov.23, 1986 interview with the attorney general, he would have seenthese words inscribed in stone:   ``Where law ends, tyranny begins.''   Keker said North responded to congressional inquiries in thelate summer of 1985 by falsely denying that the National SecurityCouncil staff was assisting the Nicaraguan rebels.   In preparing the letters, North was ``shutting down,obstructing, halting, fouling up'' the congressional inquries, saidKeker.   North made similar denials a year later in a meeting with theHouse Intelligence Committee.   When he took the witness stand in his own defense, North criedin describing the false statements he had made to the committee onAug. 6, 1986.   ``Were they real tears or were they crocodile tears?'' saidKeker. ``When he lied to them, he didn't shed any tears. He wasthorough and convincing.''   North acknowledged that he didn't tell the committee the truth,but said he didn't know he was breaking the law in doing so.   Keker dismissed North's suggestions that he was following ordersfrom top Reagan administration officials such as McFarlane andCasey. Such claims are ``no more a defense'' than ``the devil mademe do it,'' the prosecutor said.   ``Telling the truth is something you learned at your mother'sknee,'' prosecutor Keker told the jury following eight weeks oftestimony in the trial of the former White House aide.   ``Government by deception is not a free government,'' Kekersaid. ``Government by deception is not a democratic government.Government by deception is not a government under the rule of law.''   He said that in contrast to North's portrait of himself as aMarine who simply followed orders, the former National SecurityCouncil aide also ``described himself as a man of great power.''   He said North ``did not hesitate'' to abuse that power bysaying, ``This is the White House calling,'' whether the call wasto Cabinet officials ``or a car dealer.''   Keker contended that North stole some of the money in a $300,000cash fund operated from his office safe to pay for a used car. Thefund was financed by Contra leader Adolfo Calero and retired AirForce Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, whom North had enlisted to run armsto the Contras.   North testified that he got money for the GMC Suburban vehiclefrom a metal box nailed to his closet floor at home.   ``Oliver North gave you a story about buying that car whichturns out not to be true,'' Keker told the jury.   ``He used the operational account'' in his office safe, whichwas a source of ``liquid, untraceable, unaccountable funds,'' saidKeker. ``They were given to him without any'' strings attached ``atall.''   Keker said North also used travelers checks from Calero ``as apersonal piggy bank.'' North is charged with unlawfully converting$4,300 in travelers checks to his own use.   Former National Security Council staffer Mary Dix testifiedFriday that North complained he was extremely short of cash on atleast five occasions, stopping suddenly in mid-1985.   North ``says he was never tempted'' by the $300,000 cash fund inhis office, said Keker. ``You don't need to be an accountant, youdon't need to be a lawyer'' to figure out what happened, theprosecutor said. ``Use your common sense.''   Asked last week whether he got cash from Secord the same day hehad paid off the vehicle, North said he couldn't recall.</TEXT></DOC>
