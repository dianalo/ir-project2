Gear Inc. was hit with a rash ofshareholder lawsuits in the wake of its announcement Fridaythat it expects to post a sharp drop in net income for thequarter ended May 31.   A total of 15 lawsuits were filed in federal court here,all alleging that the Marina del Rey, Calif., sneakercompany's officers and directors issued a series of false andmisleading statements to inflate the company's stock priceand conceal adverse information. L.A. Gear's stock hasplummeted nearly $20 a share in the past 1 1/2 weeks, from arecord high of $50.375 a share, when the company announcedlate last month that it had signed singer Paula Abdul as acelebrity endorser.</LP><TEXT>   The bulk of the stock drop came Friday, when L.A. Gearannounced that it would report second-quarter per-share netincome of between 50 cents and 60 cents, compared with 91cents a year earlier. The company blamed the drop on itsproduct mix, with increased sales of lower-priced, lessprofitable shoes that it had pushed to gain market share andretail shelf space, coupled with increased sales of itslower-margin apparel and international footwear.   An L.A. Gear spokeswoman said the company hadn't beenserved with the lawsuits and, therefore, couldn't comment.   Fourteen of the lawsuits were identical in language andwere filed by the same local counsel on behalf of plaintiffsand other attorneys around the country. They seek unspecifieddamages, plus treble punitive damages under the RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The suits seekclass-action status on behalf of shareholders who bought L.A.Gear stock between Sept. 29, 1989, and June 1.   The other complaint, filed on behalf of investor JosephScorese, is for a class of investors who bought L.A. Gearshares between May 14 and June 1 this year. It also seeksunspecified damages.   The 14 suits charge that nine company officers grossedalmost $33 million by selling 1.1 million shares since lastfall while in possession of adverse inside information aboutthe company's business. The figures don't include stock salesmade last month, the complaints said. The suits also repeatallegations from previous suits against the company that thevalue of imports had been understated to avoid import dutiesand that investors had been misled into believing that L.A.Gear could diversify and adapt to fashion trends.</TEXT></DOC>
