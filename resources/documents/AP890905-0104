The new policy excludes civilian employees of the PoliceDepartment. The department now requires random drug tests only ofthe 2,000 officers in the Narcotics Division. Applicants for theDetective Division and the Organized Crime Control Bureau are alsotested, but not at random.   Other officers can be tested based on administrative or medicalcause.   Under the new program, all officers' Social Security numbers willbe entered into a computer, which will select some at random foreach test. The officers chosen will have 24 hours notice of the test.   Ward, who was in Washington, was not available to comment on thepolicy change.   Phil Caruso, head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association,which represents police officers, was also not immediately availablefor comment, spokesman Joe Mancini said.   During 1988, 3,946 police officers were tested, with 37 officerstesting positive. This year, through July, 2,220 police officerswere tested with 23 testing positive.   Random drug tests are also required of candidates for policeofficer as well as police recruits at the Police Academy, and at thecompletion of their probationary period.   It is expected that additional staffing will be necessary toadminister the program and the lab costs of the drug testing areestimated at $31,000 per year.</TEXT></DOC>
