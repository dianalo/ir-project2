In the case of highmean stresses (if the nodes are welded), the resistance to variable amplitudeloading with high stress peak levels is satisfactory. With the use ofimproved finishing techniques, the permitted stress level can be increased,and the fatigue strength is improved. 23 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
