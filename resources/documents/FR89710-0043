The Lower NechesValley Authority (LNVA) contributed funds toward construction of both projectsand makes established annual payments for the right to withdraw up to 2000cubic feet of water per second from Town Bluff for its own use. Power waslegislatively authorized at the project, but installation of hydroelectricfacilities was deferred until justified by economic conditions. A determinationof feasibility was made in a 1982 Corps study. In 1983, the SRMA proposedto sponsor the development of hydropower at Town Bluff in return for theoutput of the project to be delivered to its member municipalities; Jasper,Liberty and Livingston, Texas and Vinton, Louisiana, as well as, the participatingmember cooperatives of the Sam Rayburn Dam Electric Cooperative, of whichthe SRMA municipals are also members and through which they receive a portionof the power produced at the Sam Rayburn Dam. SRMA provided non-Federalfunds for the entire design and construction of the project which was performedby the Corps at a cost of approximately $18 million. SRMA will pay allannual operating and marketing costs, as well as expected capital replacementcosts, through the rate paid to the SWPA, and will receive all power andenergy produced at the project for a period of 50 years from the commercialon-line date.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The 1989 Town Bluff Dam Revised Initial Power Repayment Study indicatesthat an annual rate of $373,068 will be required beginning on the datethe project's generators are declared in commercial operation, to recoverannual costs of marketing and operation and maintenance (Oandamp;M), andto repay the isolated project's investment in additions or replacementsin accordance with Department of Energy Order No. RA 6120.2 and Section5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944. The proposed rate is classified asa minor rate adjustment in accordance with Title 10, Part 903, SubpartA of the code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR Part 903), ``Procedures forPublic Participation in Power and Transmission Rate Adjustments and Extensions''(50 FR 37837), since it is for establishment of a rate for a new servicefrom a power system with an installed capacity of less than 20 MW.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">SWPA published Notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> April 6, 1989, announcing a 30-day period forpublic review and comment concerning a proposed annual rate of $285,444as required by 10 CFR 903. By letter dated April 11, 1989, SWPA provideda copy of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice and supporting data for the 1989 PowerRepayment Study to the customer for information and review. The letteralso confirmed a meeting among SRMA, SWPA and the Corps which was heldon April 20, 1989, to discuss the rate proposal, among other things. Atthe meeting, the Corps provided new and more detailed information whichsignificantly increased their previous estimates of annual Oandamp;M costs.Further, the Corps indicated that the commercial on-line date for the projectwould be delayed until about July 1, 1989, rather than June 1 as expectedearlier. In accordance with 10 CFR 903.18, SWPA extended the initial commentperiod by 15 days to announce a revised proposed rate of $373,068 annually,made necessary by the new Oandamp;M estimates and on-line date. By letterdated May 5, 1989, SWPA provided a preliminary copy of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notice, which was published on May 19, 1989 (54FR 21929), and a 1989 Revised Initial Power Repayment Study with supportingdata to the customer for review and comment. Written comments from thecustomer and interested parties were accepted through May 23, 1989, andare contained along with SWPA's responses in the Comments and ResponsesSection of this Rate Order.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Discussion</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The 1989 Revised Initial Power Repayment Study tests the adequacyof the revised proposed initial rate based on a cost evaluation periodextending from initial commercial operation in FY 1989 through FY 1993,to cover annual expenses for marketing, operation and maintenance, andto amortize additions to plant and major replacement of the generatingfacilities. Since the project's design and construction were financed intheir entirety by the non-Federal sponsor, SRMA, no component for amortizationof the original investment of some $18 million is included in the ratedetermination. The Power Repayment Study is, therefore, presented somewhatdifferently than normal, and illustrates the collection of revenues inadvance of their need for repayment of future replacement investments.Revenues in excess of current year expenses are accumulated as surpluses,accruing an interest credit as provided by DOE Order RA 6120.2 and Corpsaccounting procedures, awaiting their use to cover replacement costs asthey occur. The original estimates of future project replacements wereprovided by the Corps in their December 6, 1988, letter to SWPA and werebased on 1988 cost data. The 1988 cost estimates were escalated to FY 1989cost levels by SWPA using ``The Handy-Whitman Index of Public Utility ConstructionCosts'' for use in the revised Study and adjusted to show FY 1990 as thefirst full year of commercial operation instead of FY 1989. The 1989 InitialPower Repayment Study estimated project replacements totaling $1,138,200for the period FY 1989 through FY 2039. The 1989 Revised Initial PowerRepayment Study estimates replacements totaling $1,107,800 for the period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By letter dated December 6, 1988, the Corps originally provided estimatesof Town Bluff Dam Oandamp;M expense for the 1989 Initial Power RepaymentStudy based on FY 1989 cost levels. SWPA adjusted those projections forinflation using Gross National Product Deflators for FY 1990 through FY1993. The original estimates of Corps Oandamp;M expense for the 1989 InitialPower Repayment Study varied from $76,700 in FY 1989 (4 months) to a maximuminflation-adjusted Oandamp;M expense figure of $258,100 for FY 1993, whichwas extended through the end of the repayment period in FY 2039. Basedon a more detailed analysis of costs, the Corps provided new estimatesof Oandamp;M expense by letter dated April 27, 1989. The more detailed analysisincluded a number of assumptions about the costs of operating and maintainingthe Town Bluff project in conjunction with the Sam Rayburn Dam projectimmediately upstream. Town Bluff hydropower will be operated and maintainedfrom Sam Rayburn Dam with the addition of only a few maintenance staffrather than having its own full complement of operators, superintendent,maintenance and clerical support. In developing the estimated Oandamp;M costsfor Town Bluff, the Corps assumed the operators' time and labor costs wouldbe shared equally (50/50) between Sam Rayburn and Town Bluff, while twoman-years of labor would be necessary to maintain Town Bluff. Supervisoryand clerical staff would spend one-fourth and one-eight of their time,respectively, on Town Bluff work. Further, about 45 percent of the supervisor'stime assigned to Town Bluff (25 percent of time) is assumed to relate tooperations while 55 percent relates to maintenance. Clerical support assignedto Town Bluff (12.5 percent of time) is assumed to relate 50 percent tooperations and 50 percent to maintenance. Until some actual experiencein these areas is obtained and a detailed efforts analysis can be made,these assumptions appear reasonable. The assumptions utilized produce anend result that about 60 percent of the total cost of operations (as distinctfrom maintenance) of the two projects is assigned to Sam Rayburn Dam andabout 40 percent to Town Bluff. The resulting estimates of Oandamp;M forTown Bluff were used for the 1989 Revised Initial Power Repayment Studyand vary from $94,587 in FY 1989 (3 months) to a maximum inflation-adjustedOandamp;M expense figure of $346,124 for FY 1993 and thereafter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Estimates of General Administrative and Overhead (GAandamp;O) expensefor both the 1989 Initial and Revised Initial Power Repayment Studies werebased on SWPA's FY 1989 Department of Energy Internal Review Budget forFY 1989-1993. The FY 1993 amount is used for each subsequent year of thePower Repayment Study. GAandamp;O Expense is assigned to isolated projects,including both the Town Bluff and the Sam Rayburn Dam projects, based onthe capital investment in the Southwestern Federal Power System (SWFPS)excluding transmission investment, as a percentage of total capital investmentin the SWFPS, and the installed hydroelectric capacity of the project asa percent of the total installed hydroelectric capacity in the SWFPS. Afive year average (FY 1984-FY 1988) of actual Transmission and GAandamp;OExpense for the SWFPS indicates that GAandamp;O Expense comprises 45.6 percentand Transmission Expense 54.4 percent of the total Transmission and GAandamp;OExpense. Transmission Expense is not chargeable to the Town Bluff Dam project.The project was expected to have 6 MW of installed capacity (two 3 MW generators)according to the Corps' plan for development of the most economical project.However, during construction, a decision was made to substitute two 4 MWunits for the two 3 MW units originally planned, based on ``off-the-shelf''availability at no more than an equivalent price. Consequently, 8 MW ofinstalled capacity was used instead of 6 MW in the assignment of GAandamp;Ocosts to the project in both the Initial and Revised Initial Power RepaymentStudies. The 1989 Initial Power Repayment Study estimated GAandamp;O expenseassignable to the Town Bluff Dam Project to be $6,500 in FY 1989 (4 months),while the 1989 Revised Initial Power Repayment Study estimates the GAandamp;Oexpense to be $4,900 for FY 1989 (3 months). Both the Initial and RevisedInitial Studies show the assignable GAandamp;O costs to increase to $21,800in FY 1993, which was carried through the end of the repayment period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Comments andamp; Responses</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Southwestern Power Administration received two written repliesby letters dated May 4 and May 22, 1989, both from the customer, SRMA,concerning the Notices published in the Federal Register April 6, 1989,and May 19, 1989, which announced the proposed and revised proposed TownBluff Dam power rates respectively, scheduled for implementation upon commercialoperation of the project. A summary of the four major comments and SWPA'sresponses to those comments follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Use of 6 MW Vs. 8 MW Installed Capacity to Assign GAandamp;O</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> SRMA believes it would be inequitable to utilize 8 MWbased on the installed capacity of units not originally designed for theproject to assign SWPA General Administration and Overhead (GAandamp;O) coststo the Town Bluff Dam in the Power Repayment Study, if the units are infact able to produce only 6 MW, or some other rating. Since the actualcapacity will soon be determined during testing, SRMA suggests the 6 MWcontemplated in the power sales contract be used in the initial rate toassign GAandamp;O costs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Response:</T3> SWPA agrees that the correct capacity quantity shouldbe used to establish the GAandamp;O assignment to Town Bluff and that testingwill soon determine whether each unit is able to produce the rated 4 MWof installed capacity at the design head. However, the original 6 MW waschosen for installation at the project because that capacity produced thegreatest net economic benefits, not necessarily because it was the optimumproject design capacity. In fact a variety of installed capacities rangingfrom 2 to 11 MW were evaluated, with unit numbers and sizes including one2 MW unit (2 MW installed); two 3 MW units (6 MW installed); four 2.5 MWunits (10 MW installed); and two 3 MW units with two 2.5 MW units (11 MWinstalled). Since economics (lowest cost construction) was the drivingfactor in the use of two 4 MW unit as opposed to the planned two 3 MW units,and it is likely that the units will generate at their design capacityof 4 MW, SWPA has elected to stay with the name plate capacity of 8 MWuntil testing confirms this or determines another rating. As a point ofinterest, the larger units may increase the expected project energy productionof the project by some 15 percent. Certainly, if the units will produceonly at a level commensurate with the expected production from the two3 MW units, since the two substituted 4 MW units are specified to haveoperating characteristics no less than those of the 3 MW units, the GAandamp;Oassignment will be modified and the rate adjusted accordingly at the nextpractical time following the development of the next annual Power RepaymentStudy, expected in January 1990.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Estimated Corps Oandamp;M Costs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>SRMA believes, given that Town Bluff will be remotelyoperated from the Sam Rayburn Dam power house, the Corps' proposal to sharepower house operators' costs equally between Sam Rayburn and Town BluffDams would be unfair, and has proposed that such costs could be distributedbased on installed plant capacity (approximately 85/15 percent respectively)or in such a way that the split of operation costs reflects the power andenergy benefits accruing from the sales relationships between the projectsand the SRDEC and SRMA entities and their members (approximately 60/40percent respectively).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Response: </T3>The Corps has recommended that the 50/50 split of powerhouse operator labor costs be retained at the present time, since it believesthat the complexity of Town Bluff power operations coupled with water releasesfor salt water intrusion may require more than 50 percent of an operator'stime. The Corps suggests that, after the initial operation and trainingtime is completed, an actual time/work study could be performed to determineactual operator attention and work performed for the Town Bluff projectfor use in determining this cost split. This issue could appropriatelybe reviewed and dicussed as part of the ongoing agenda of the InformalWorking Group (IWG) for Town Bluff which SRMA, SWPA and the Corps haveagreed to establish. SWPA believes that, as a practical matter, the entitiesinvolved (SRDEC and SRMA) can sort out the costs of the two projects betweenthemselves irrespective of the Corps split, as long as those entities remainthe recipients of Sam Rayburn and Town Bluff Dam outputs. Also, as a practicalmatter, while the assumption of a 50/50 split in operator costs betweenSam Rayburn and Town Bluff may remain debatable, the impact of other assumptionsregarding the times of the superintendent and clerical support personnelassigned to the operations of Town Bluff (as opposed to maintenance) notedin the discussion of Oandamp;M cost estimates in both the Rate Order andthe Record of Decision, results in a split of total operations costs ofabout 60 percent to Sam Rayburn and 40 percent to Town Bluff.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Updating/Replacing Scada and Microwave System</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>SRMA is concerned about updating and replacing the SCADAand microwave systems after only 15 years, as per the Corps replacementschedule, and is also concerned about the proposed rotor rewinding rehabilitationat or near the end of the 50-year contract period, submitting that equityargues for continuation of SRMA as the recipient of Town Bluff power afterthe current 50-year Power Sales Agreement since there will be substantialvalue in the remaining service lives of other capital investments for whichpayments will have been initiated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Response</T3>: The estimated service life of the SCADA and microwavesystems, as well as other major components of plant, is established bythe Corps' Engineering Regulations (ERs). These ERs are based on the besthistorical information available and the service lives given representthe average experienced lives for that equipment. These service lives donot necessarily mean that the times will be replaced at this time, butitems are replaced as needed based on condition and reliability. Incidentally,SWPA is anticipating replacement of its SCADA system in FY 1991 which isabout 15 years from the year of installation. This action is necessarydue to both physical deterioration and technological obsolescence.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">SRMA is correct in recognizing that replacements occurring late inthe 50-year replacement period are prorated so that only a portion of theinvestment cost of such items is charged to SRMA during the initial 50-yearterm of the Power Sales Agreement. However, while SRMA may believe it hasa vested interest in the project, having fully funded its constructionand having paid all of its costs including replacement costs, to keep itfully operational past the initial 50-year period, SWPA believes SRMA isno different than any other customer purchasing Federal hydroelectric power,except that it has prepaid a portion of its power bill for 50 years. Whilethis method of paying for its power is different, it results in havingpaid a certain price for power received and provides no special consideration,or equity interest, for SRMA over another potential applicant for TownBluff power after the 50-year contract. Current policy provides for continuationof capacity allocations beyond present contract terms, and SRMA's proximityto the project and the ready availability of transmission facilities providedby SRMA would appear to be positive factors in considering any future dispositionof the power producing resources of the project.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Oandamp;M Cost Increases Since 1983</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>SRMA is concerned that the annual costs for Oandamp;M andmajor rehabilitation have increased from some $226,000 estimated in 1983,to over $300,000 today in spite of having directly absorbed several costsincluded in the original estimate which were intended to reduce those annualOandamp;M costs. While acknowledging recent sizeable salary increase by poweroperating personnel, SRMA believes further explanation is appropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Response: </T3>The earlier estimates of annual costs were based ona generic ``cost per megawatt'' curve and past plant historical costs.The most recent, approximately $300,000 cost, is based on a detailed operationand scheduled maintenance estimate. Corps maintenance schedules are determinedby Engineering Regulations which outline required maintenance for Corpspower plants. Operator personnel have received one pay raise in 1983, andtwo since 1983 totalling over 30%, while inflation has accounted for theremaining increase in the level of estimated Oandamp;M costs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Availability of Information</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Information regarding this rate proposal including studies, commentsand other supporting material, is available for public review in the officesof the Southwestern Power Administration, 333 West 4th, Tulsa, Oklahoma74103.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Administrator's Certification</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The 1989 Revised Initial Town Bluff Dam Power Repayment Study indicatesthat an annual Town Bluff Dam Power rate of $373,068 will repay all annualcosts of the project including amortization of the expected replacementinvestment consistent with provisions of Department of Energy Order No.RA 6120.2.
