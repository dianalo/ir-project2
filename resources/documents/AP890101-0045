The cease-fire offer was made Friday by Afghan President Najib,and the Soviet Union announced Saturday that its troops would jointhe truce.   In a televised address to his nation Sunday, Najib complainedthat rebels have expanded operations against his government andrepeated his offer of direct talks with them, Tass reported. He alsorejected any future Afghan government that excludes the presentleadership, the official Soviet news agency said.   The rebels recently opened talks with Soviet representatives.   Guerrillas attacked government troops Sunday in two villages inthe eastern Nangarahar province, official Radio Kabul reported in abroadcast monitored in Islamabad.   The radio said eight guerrillas were killed and seven wounded inthe attack on the military posts in Gushta and Deh Bala. It gave nocasualty figures for government troops, but it said soldierslaunched mopping up operations against the rebels after the attack.   Rebel leader Ahmad Shah said the cease-fire was ``a condemnablesuggestion.''   The seven-party Guerrilla Alliance named Shah head of theProvisional Islamic Governmnent, which has yet to be installed.   ``It only shows how desperate Najib is,'' Shah said in astatement issued in Peshawar. ``Najib has repeatedly proposed suchmeaningless cease-fires, but every time we rejected them.''
