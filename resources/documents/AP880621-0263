At a news conference marking the end of his eighth and finaleconomic summit, Reagan also was asked about the drought plaguingthe United States. Noting he has set up a task force to look intothe problem, Reagan said, ``outside of praying for rain, thereisn't anything I can do until we hear from them.''   On another subject, he suggested that gun-control laws should betightened to require that gun-holders undergo some training.   After the news conference and a speech to Canadian businessmen,Reagan returned home to Washington, where he was met at the WhiteHouse by chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr.   Uncharacteristically, Reagan did not have a full house ofreporters for his news conference. Some correspondents said theyhad difficulty getting through the strict security in the hotelwhere the session was held, and the White House staff shuffledreporters around to fill up empty seats in front rows.   Once again, Reagan refused to say whether he would pardon OliverNorth or John Poindexter for their alleged roles in the Iran-Contrascandal. However, he said the legal case against them ``has to goforward or they would live the rest of their lives under a shadowof guilt.''   Immediately after his opening statement, Reagan was pepperedwith questions about the investigation of alleged corruption at thePentagon.   ``I think all of us are disappointed and upset that such thingscould happen,'' Reagan said. Nevertheless, he said, ``I think itshould be understandable how such things can happen in something asbig as our government is.''   Reagan added, ``But I think we also ought to recognize thatwithin our government ... it brought the units to which we entrustsuch things'' to launch an investigation.   The president said he did not want to leave the impression theproblem was minor. ``I don't feel that way at all. As a matter offact, I'm very upset. ... I'm not taking this lightly at all.''   However, he said, it was the Pentagon, itself, ``that uncoveredand then proceeded to investigate and pin down where there wasguilt.''   Prosecutors this week disclosed a widespread investigation intoalleged bribery and fraud in the Pentagon weapons purchasingsystem, and disclosed that it used wiretaps that recorded more than4,700 telephone conversations as part of the probe.   Reagan said Caspar Weinberger, his longtime friend and defensesecretary for seven years until late in 1987, was ``one of thefinest'' Pentagon chiefs ever even though the alleged corruptionhappened on his watch.   He said he didn't think the affair would give Democraticpresidential candidate Michael Dukakis a boost in his race againstRepublican George Bush.   ``I don't think it really gives him any at all ... I don't thinkthis is a case at high levels,'' Reagan said.   When a reporter asked whether a change in his management stylemight have prevented the problem at the Pentagon, Reagan said hedoubted it. ``You can't be down there watching several millionpeople in the total of all of the companies and the DefenseDepartment every day in what they're doing.''   His remarks on gun control were prompted by a question about anincident in which columnist Carl Rowan shot a teenager who wastrespassing in his swimming pool in the middle of the night.   Reagan said that at his ranch in California, he taught hisentire family how to shoot a gun ``in case they need to.''   Reagan said he would like to see states adopt a system thatwould require a background check before a person could purchase agun, to make sure they ``don't have a record of any crimes ormental problems or anything of that kind.''   In addition, he said, ``I think maybe there could be somerestrictions, that there had to be a certain amount of trainingtaken,'' Reagan added.   On other matters:   _ He said he doubted that record losses in the savings and loanindustry would add up to a crisis. ``I certainly hope not and Idon't think so,'' he said, although he conceded, ``there is aproblem there and we're trying to deal'' with it.   _ Launched into a long defense of his handling of theIran-Contra affair reminiscent of his statements in the days andweeks immediately after the scandal broke 18 months ago. Hedefended his decision to seek ties with moderates in Iran, and saidhe had worked as best and as quickly as he could to make the factsof the diversion of funds to the Contra rebels public after hefound out about it.   _ ``We love Canada,'' he said in thanking the host nation.</TEXT></DOC>
