The immediate reaction is to bephysically sickened by the awful scene. By consensus, thegoal is to prevent more such outrages. At the moment, thefocus for that effort seems to be on what is called policebrutality. That's all right, but we suspect that if thisincident starts and ends there, we'll have missed anopportunity to recognize -- and do something about -- a much,much larger problem.   This awful beating is the latest symptom of acriminal-justice system that has broken down. By coincidence,not long before this incident, the Los Angeles Times did anextremely fine series of articles on the local crime problemunder the telling title, &quot;Justice in Distress: TheDevaluation of Crime in Los Angeles.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The series began, &quot;Crime is choking the criminal justicesystem in Los Angeles. Numbed by rising violence andoverwhelmed by drug offenses, the system regularly givesshort shrift to all but the most serious crimes. Police oftentake hours to respond to burglaries and other propertycrimes, if they respond at all, and most of the cases arenever investigated. Prosecutors trade guilty pleas for lessersentences for nearly every crime, including homicide, rapeand robbery. Judges regularly grant probation to habitualnarcotics dealers and other repeat offenders who, by law,should go to prison.&quot;   So let's try to make a distinction: The beating isinexcusable; but it looks like it's explainable. Yes, thepolice officers know right from wrong, just as thecommentators who are never touched by the world of moderncrime also are pointing out right from wrong. But the police-- and indeed the criminals -- are the only ones operatingdaily in a criminal-justice system that can barely functionanymore, much less punish the guilty and protect theinnocent.   The police officers who report to work every day in manylarge American cities know that relatively few crimes aresolved, that when arrests are made only a tiny percentage ofconvicts go to jail, and of those, very few ever do serioustime. Indeed, police, criminals and the citizens who actuallylive in the most crime-infested neighborhoods all understand,as Tom Kando writes nearby, that we live in a lawless era(see related editorial: &quot;L.A. Debate -- Police Are AlsoVictims&quot; -- WSJ March 19, 1991).   Start with the misleading fact that we have record numbersof people in jail. A criminal, however, also understands thatthe odds of his becoming one of these inmates areincreasingly small. The L.A. Times series reported that ofall the felonies committed in that city, only 17% resulted inarrests, and only about 5% resulted in anyone going to jail.This one-in-20 chance of going to jail for a serious crime isfairly typical for big cities. In New York City, the chancesare now less than one in 100 of going to jail for a felony.No wonder we have so much crime. We invite more crime byfailing to control or punish it.   And as has been well reported, some police officers aren'tthe only ones who snap under such an awful system. Citizensburn down crack houses. In poor New York neighborhoods,spontaneous vigilante groups have corralled and beaten pursesnatchers; and a black father taking his young son home onthe subway from a movie fended off an attacking beggar bykicking him in the head, killing him. It is no greatpsychological mystery that helplessness breeds anger andfrustration. &quot;We are fooling the public,&quot; Los Angeles'snow-besieged Police Chief Daryl Gates said last year. &quot;Theythink because everybody talks tough, that the system istough.&quot; But it isn't.   Look at the judges. Somehow the idea has built up thatjudges have no responsibility for seeing that thecriminal-justice system convicts criminals, only that theirjob is to ensure that the police memorize the latestMirandaized proceduralism. Just last week the federal appealscourt that includes California ruled that police departmentsare now liable not only for training officers, but also for&quot;training in the constitutional limits&quot;; this creates policeliability whenever there is a violation of the most recent5-4 split Supreme Court opinion. When the Los Angeles Timesasked whether the criminal-justice system was basicallysound, more than 80% of municipal judges said yes; half thepolice said no.   There are some solutions. President Bush's crime billrecognizes the problem of police misconduct even as the billfinally raises the direct role the exclusionary rule hasplayed in the system's breakdown. The bill would abolish themischievous exclusionary rule in federal cases where theevidence seized in violation of some court precedent showsthat a gun was used in a crime. Under the bill, juries wouldbe able to use the evidence to convict defendants, and theJustice Department for the first time would set up a formalsystem for disciplining officers who violate the rules andfor compensating innocent victims of police offenses.   Again, nothing can excuse police officers who beatsuspects -- not the adrenalin-pumping experience of ahigh-speed chase and not the collapse of a criminal-justicesystem that has little to do with justice. Instead, thelesson is that a functioning criminal-justice system worthyof public respect would make police beatings less common. Thepolice would have some confidence that justice could be donethe legal way.   Perhaps the most frightening lesson of this incident isthat when criminal laws fail, some form of vigilantism willemerge. The proven way to avoid a further descent towardcapricious, personal law is to make sure that everyone --citizens, cops, criminals -- knows that punishment for crimeswill be swift and sure.</TEXT></DOC>
