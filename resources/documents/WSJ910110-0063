Wells Fargo has one of the highest concentrations ofcommercial real-estate and construction loans among majorbanks. Speculators have taken a large short position in thecompany's stock, predicting that the rapidly softeningCalifornia real-estate market will cause Wells Fargo hugelosses. In shorting a stock, speculators sell borrowedshares, hoping to replace them later at a lower price.</LP><TEXT>   Results of the examination haven't been released. WellsFargo closed yesterday at $50.875, down 50 cents in compositetrading on the New York Stock Exchange.   Short interest in Wells Fargo's stock jumped 77% inOctober, about the same time that investor Warren Buffettmade an opposite bet, buying a 9.8% interest in the bankingcompany. In December, short interest fell 10% to about 5.2million shares.   The Office of the Comptroller, considered a tough bankingregulator, found no reason to direct major increases inreserves, several individuals familiar with the review said.Analysts estimate Wells Fargo earned $3 to $3.05 a share inthe fourth quarter, about the same as the operating earningsfor the previous three periods. They did note, however, thatproblem real-estate loans appear to be mounting gradually,and are apt to require Wells Fargo to increase reservesmoderately to the point of decreasing 1991 earnings 5% to 10%from 1990 estimates.   The San Francisco bank will probably have to raisequarterly loan loss reserves to an estimated $100 millionfrom $75 million, said Donald Crowley with Keefe, Bruyette andamp;Woods, Inc., and its loan charge-off ratio should rise to asmuch as 0.6% of assets this year from 0.4%. As a result, 1991earnings will be about $11.75, or 9% below earlier estimates,said Mr. Crowley, who added that he had no knowledge of theresults of the comptroller's examination. He believes WellsFargo will report earnings of about $13.50 a share for 1990,including a special gain of $1.34 a share in the secondquarter.   In the first nine months of 1990, it earned $555 million,or $10.48 a share, up 25% from the year-earlier period.   In another sign that Wells Fargo is preparing for a toughyear, the bank disclosed that it won't give merit payincreases to its senior managers this year and will decreaseraises slightly for about one thousand other managers. Acompany spokeswoman said the pay freeze, which will affect130 top executives, is &quot;an effort to keep expenses down andthat will obviously help earnings. It's a difficult bankingenvironment. We control the things that we can.&quot; Theyear-long freeze takes effect Feb. 1.   A 5% to 10% drop in earnings isn't the financialArmageddon expected by the shorts. Wells Fargo's detractorssaid it is too early to conclude that the bank has escapedmajor damage.   &quot;The OCC never anticipates anything. They just react,&quot;said Tom Barton, an analyst with Feshback Brothers, a bigshort seller of Wells Fargo stock. &quot;You won't see a majordeterioration at Wells Fargo for two to four quarters. Whenit reports fourth- and first-quarter results, shareholderswill say, ah, we survived. And then they are going to getpounded.&quot;   There are signs of growing distress in Californiareal-estate markets, with some thrifts reporting largeincreases in delinquent loans to homebuilders, and severalJapanese banks and investor groups getting stuck withtroubled commercial real-estate projects. But so far, the topfour California banks haven't reported major disasters fromnonperforming real-estate loans.   BankAmerica Corp., also based in San Francisco, isexpected to report robust earnings for the fourth quarter.Previously troubled First Interstate Bancorp, Los Angeles, israpidly reducing its costs and is generating high profits atits flagship California bank. The other large Los Angelesbank, Security Pacific Corp., will report a bigfourth-quarter loss, but not because of Californiareal-estate. It is suffering from bad loans in Australia,England and Arizona.</TEXT></DOC>
