Wastes removed from the exclusion will become subjectto hazardous waste regulations if they are found to exhibit a hazardouscharacteristic or are otherwise identified or listed as hazardous. In compliancewith a Court order, the Agency will finalize the scope of the Bevill exclusionfor the 20 mineral processing wastes by January 15, 1990. The seven wastesproposed for removal from the Bevill exclusion are: roast/leach ore residuefrom primary chromite production, process wastewater from coal gasification,furnace off-gas solids from elemental phosphorus production, process wastewaterfrom hydrofluoric acid production, process wastewater from primary leadprocessing, sulfate process waste acids from titanium dioxide production,and sulfate process waste solids from titanium dioxide production. Wastesremaining within the exclusion will be addressed in a Report to Congressand subsequent Regulatory Determination by January 31, 1991. In addition, today's notice contains a proposal to modify the RCRA subtitleC definition of ``designated facility'' for purposes of clarifying therequirements for completing hazardous waste shipment manifests for transportingwastes from one state where they are regulated as hazardous to anotherin which they are not regulated as hazardous. Section 3001(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act(RCRA) excludes ``solid waste from the extraction, beneficiation, and processingof ores and minerals'' from regulation as hazardous waste under subtitleC of RCRA, pending completion of certain studies by EPA. In 1980, EPA interpretedthis exclusion (on a temporary basis) to encompass ``solid waste from theexploration, mining, milling, smelting, and refining of ores and minerals''(45 FR 76619, November 19, 1980). EPA proposed the criteria by which mineral processing wastes would be evaluatedfor continued exclusion on October 20, 1988 (53 FR 41288) and proposedrevisions to the criteria on April 17, 1989 (54 FR 15316). On August 18(see 54 FR 36592; September 1, l989), EPA published the final criteria,and took final action on the Bevill status of all but 20 mineral processingwaste streams. The Agency conditionally retained these 20 mineral processingwastes within the exclusion from subtitle C regulation provided by section3001(b)(3)(A)(ii) of RCRA pending collection and analysis of additionalinformation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> EPA will accept public comments on this proposal untilNovember 9, 1989.

History Section 3001(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act(RCRA) excludes ``solid waste from the extraction, beneficiation, and processingof ores and minerals'' from regulation as hazardous waste under subtitleC of RCRA, pending completion of certain studies by EPA. In 1980, EPA interpretedthis exclusion (on a temporary basis) to encompass ``solid waste from theexploration, mining, milling, smelting, and refining of ores and minerals''(45 FR 76619, November 19, 1980). EPA proposed the criteria by which mineral processing wastes would be evaluatedfor continued exclusion on October 20, 1988 (53 FR 41288) and proposedrevisions to the criteria on April 17, 1989 (54 FR 15316). On September1, 1989 (see 54 FR 36592), EPA provided the final Bevill exclusion criteria.(See section II of this preamble for a complete presentation of the definitionsof mineral processing and beneficiation wastes and the high volume andlow hazard criteria.) The September rulemaking also finalized the Bevill status of nine mineralprocessing waste streams that had been proposed either for retention withinor removal from the exclusion in the April 1989 notice. EPA temporarilyretained for study in the July 1990 Report to Congress five wastes withinthe Bevill exclusion: 1. Slag from primary copper processing. 2. Slag from primary lead processing. 3. Red and brown muds from bauxite processing. 4. Phosphogypsum from phosphoric acid production. 5. Slag from elemental phosphorus production. EPA permanently removed the remaining four wastes from the Bevill exclusion:1. Acid plant and scrubber blowdown from primary copper processing. 2. Acid plant blowdown from primary lead processing. 3. Furnace scrubber blowdown from elemental phosphorus production. 4. Air pollution control scrubber blowdown from primary tin processing.In addition, the Agency modified the list of mineral processing wastesproposed for conditional retention in April 1989. In the September 1989rulemaking, the Agency conditionally retained 20 mineral processing wasteswithin the Bevill exclusion: 1. Roast/leach ore residue from primary chromite production. 2. Gasifier ash from coal gasification. 3. Process wastewater from coal gasification. 4. Calcium sulfate wastewater treatment plant sludge from primary copperprocessing. 5. Slag tailings from primary copper processing. 6. Furnace off-gas solids from elemental phosphorus production. 7. Fluorogypsum from hydrofluoric acid production. 8. Process wastewater from hydrofluoric acid production. 9. Air pollution control dust/sludge from iron blast furnaces. 10. Iron blast furnace slag. 11. Process wastewater from primary lead production. 12. Air pollution control dust/sludge from lightweight aggregate production.13. Process wastewater from primary magnesium processing by the anhydrousprocess. 14. Process wastewater from phosphoric acid production. 15. Basic oxygen furnace and open hearth furnace air pollution controldust/sludge from carbon steel production. 16. Basic oxygen furnace and open hearth furnace slag from carbon steelproduction. 17. Sulfate process waste acids from titanium dioxide production. 18. Sulfate process waste solids from titanium dioxide production. 19. Chloride process waste solids from titanium tetrachloride production.20. Slag from primary zinc processing. All other mineral processing wastes that were not conditionally retainedwill be permanently removed from the Bevill exclusion as of the effectivedate of the September 1, 1989 rule (March 1, 1990 in non-authorized states)and will be subject to RCRA subtitle C regulation if they are solid wastesand exhibit one or more of the characteristics of hazardous waste as definedin 40 CFR part 261. In addition, the Agency could, in the future, proposeone or more of these wastes for listing as a hazardous waste under 40 CFR261.10-11. No such action is, however, being taken at this time. Today's proposal also includes another issue which may affect not onlywastes removed from the Bevill exclusion, but other newly listed or identifiedwastes. EPA's generator regulations require a generator of hazardous wasteto designate on the manifest one facility which is permitted to handlethe waste described on the manifest. The Agency has received a number ofinquiries regarding waste shipments from a state where a waste is consideredto be hazardous to a state where the waste is not regulated as hazardous.This situation can arise when EPA lists or identifies a new waste as hazardousunder its pre-HSWA authority, as is proposed in today's notice implementingthe final Bevill criteria for mineral processing wastes. EPA believes thatthe regulatory language should be clarified regarding these interstatewaste shipments. B. Overview of Today's Proposed Rule Today's proposed rule describes the results of the Agency's applicationof the high volume and low hazard criteria contained in the September 1,1989 rule to the 20 conditionally retained mineral processing wastes. Thisapplication involved a three-step process (section IV of this preamblediscusses each step in greater detail). First, the Agency applied the highvolume criteria to the available waste generation data for the 20 wastes.These data consisted of detailed information supplied by over 200 mineralprocessing facilities in EPA's 1989 National Survey of Solid Wastes fromMineral Processing Facilities, as well as information independently submittedby these and other facilities in response to recent Agency actions. Foreach conditionally retained waste, the Agency calculated the highest averageannual facility-level generation rate during 1983-1988. Mineral processingwastes generated above the volume criteria thresholds (an average annualrate of 45,000 metric tons per facility for non-liquid wastes, and 1,000,000metric tons for liquid wastes) passed the high volume criterion. In the second step, the Agency evaluated the status of each of the 20 wasteswith respect to the low hazard criterion using the relevant waste characteristicsdata available to the Agency. These data primarily consisted of the analyticaldata results from a mineral processing waste sampling and analysis effortconducted by EPA at selected mineral processing facilities during Juneand July, 1989, supplemented by EPA Method 1312 data independently submittedby two facilities. As described in section IV.A of this preamble, EPA considereda waste to pose a low hazard only if the waste passed both a toxicity andmobility test (Method 1312) <T3>and </T3>a pH test. The third step involved consolidating the results from the first two stepsto determine the proposed Bevill status of the 20 conditionally retainedmineral processing wastes. Applying these criteria, EPA today proposes to remove seven mineral processingwastes from the Bevill exclusion, and to temporarily retain 13 mineralprocessing wastes within the exclusion (in addition to the five alreadyretained in the September 1 rule), pending preparation of a Report to Congressand the subsequent Regulatory Determination. The seven mineral processingwastes proposed for removal from the Bevill exclusion are: 1. Roast/leach ore residue from primary chromite production. 2. Process wastewater from coal gasification. 3. Furnace off-gas solids from elemental phosphorus production. 4. Process wastewater from hydrofluoric acid production. 5. Process wastewater from primary lead processing. 6. Sulfate process waste acids from titanium dioxide production. 7. Sulfate process waste solids from titanium dioxide production. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The 13 mineral processing wastes proposed for temporary retentionwithin the Bevill exclusion are: 1.

In addition, the Agency is today proposing a clarification to the definitionof ``designated facility'' to alleviate any confusion that the public andthe regulated community may have over its applicability. Today's proposalwould provide that if a waste is sent to an authorized state where thewaste is not regulated as hazardous, then the designated facility mustbe a facility allowed by the state to accept the waste. This regulatorychange would only apply where a hazardous waste in one state is shippedto a facility in a second state that has not yet regulated the waste ashazardous. (In fact, EPA currently interprets the definition of ``designatedfacility'' in this manner.) EPA solicits public comment on the data used to make the proposed Bevillmineral processing waste exclusion decisions outlined below, and on theproposed modification to the definition of ``designated facility.'' TheAgency will not, however, entertain or respond to comments on the finalBevill mineral processing wastes criteria. These criteria were made finalin the September 1 rule, and were developed following and in response tocomments submitted in two public comment periods subsequent to NPRMs publishedin October, 1988 and April, 1989. C. Future Activities This rule proposes the final Bevill exclusion status of 20 conditionallyretained mineral processing wastes, based upon information collected byor submitted to the Agency during recent months. EPA will take final actionon the proposed wastes by January 15, 1990. At that time, the final boundariesof the Bevill exclusion for mineral processing wastes will be established.EPA will conduct a detailed study of all mineral processing wastes retainedwithin the final Bevill exclusion boundaries. EPA will summarize the findingsof these studies in a Report to Congress to be submitted by July 31, 1990.Six months after submission of this report, the Agency will publish a RegulatoryDetermination stating whether any of the studied wastes merits regulationunder subtitle C of RCRA as hazardous wastes, or that such regulation isunwarranted. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Bevill Exclusion Definitions and Criteria </ITAG>On August 18, 1989 (See 54 FR 36592; September 1, 1989), EPA finalizedthe definitions of mineral processing and beneficiation wastes and thehigh volume and low hazard criteria that the Agency used as the basis ofthe analysis underlying today's proposed rule. This section simply restatesthe criteria as presented in the September 1, 1989 <T4>Federal Register</T4>. EPA wishes to emphasize that the mineral processingand beneficiation definitions and volume and hazard criteria are final,and thus, the Agency does not solicit, and will not respond to, commentson them. A. Definition of Mineral Processing and Beneficiation For purposes of this rule, mineral processing wastes are generated by operationsdownstream of beneficiation (as defined by the September 1, 1989 rule)and originate from a mineral processing operation as defined by the followingelements: (1) Excluded Bevill wastes must be solid wastes as defined by EPA. (2) Excluded solid wastes must be uniquely associated with mineral industryoperations. (3) Excluded solid wastes must originate from mineral processing operationsthat possess all of the following attributes: a. Follow beneficiation of an ore or mineral (if applicable); b. Serve to remove the desired product from an ore or mineral, or froma beneficiated ore or mineral, or enhance the characteristics of ores orminerals, or beneficiated ores or minerals; c. Use mineral-value feedstocks that are comprised of less than 50 percentscrap materials; d. Produce either a final mineral product or an intermediate to the finalproduct; <T3>and </T3>e. Do not combine the product with another material that is not an oreor mineral, or beneficiated ore or mineral (e.g., alloying), do not involvefabrication or other manufacturing activities, and do not involve furtherprocessing of a marketable product of mineral processing. (4) Residuals from treatment of excluded mineral processing wastes mustbe historically or presently generated and must meet the high volume andlow hazard criteria in order to retain excluded status. Beneficiation operations include crushing, grinding, washing, dissolution,crystallization, filtration, sorting, sizing, drying, sintering, pelletizing,briquetting, calcining to remove water and/or carbon dioxide, roastingin preparation for leaching (except where the roasting/leaching sequenceproduces a final or intermediate product that does not undergo furtherbeneficiation or processing), gravity concentration, magnetic separation,electrostatic separation, flotation, ion exchange, solvent extraction,electrowinning, precipitation, amalgamation, and heap, dump, vat, tank,and <T3>in situ </T3>leaching. Processing operations generally follow beneficiation and include techniquesthat often destroy the ore or mineral, such as smelting, electrolytic refining,and acid attack or digestion.EPA wishes to emphasize that operations following the initial ``processing''step in the production sequence are also considered processing operations,irrespective of whether they involve only the techniques defined aboveas beneficiation. In addition, leaching operations that are not followedby additional beneficiation/processing operations are also defined as processingoperations. Therefore, solid wastes arising from such operations are consideredmineral processing wastes, rather than beneficiation wastes. B. The High Volume Criterion High volume mineral processing wastes are defined as (1) non-liquid mineralprocessing wastes that were generated at an average annual rate greaterthan 45,000 metric tons per year per facility during any year between 1983and 1988, and (2) liquid mineral processing wastes that were generatedat an average annual rate greater than 1,000,000 metric tons per year perfacility during any year between 1983 and 1988. For the purposes of today's proposed rule, EPA used the volume criterionfor non-liquids to determine if both solid (e.g., slag, phosphogypsum)and semi-solid (e.g., wastewater treatment sludge) materials are high volume.EPA used the volume criterion for liquids to determine whether wastewatersand other aqueous wastes are high volume. EPA employed professional judgmentin deciding which criterion to apply to particular waste streams. c. The Low Hazard Criterion <ITAG tagnum="81">1. The Toxicity and Mobility Test </ITAG>A high volume mineral processing waste is not low hazard and, therefore,is not eligible for the temporary exclusion from subtitle C requirementsprovided by the Bevill Amendment under the following conditions: andbullet; Available data indicate that waste extracts obtained using EPAMethod 1312 and analyzed using established SW-846 methods contain concentrationsof arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, selenium <T3>or</T3> silver that exceed 100 times the MCL for the constituent attwo or more facilities that generate the waste, unless: i. The waste is generated at five or more facilities; and ii. Substantial additional relevant data are available and the preponderanceof these additional data indicate that the waste should be considered lowhazard, where: a. Relevant data are defined as data that result from analysis of wasteextracts obtained by EPA Methods 1310, 1311, and 1312, ASTM Test MethodD3987-81, or comparable procedures that the Agency has reason to believeproduce reliable and representative data; and b. To be considered substantial, the additional data must characterizethe waste at 3 plants (other than the plants where Method 1312 resultsexceed 100 times the MCLs) <T3>or</T3> at least half of the facilities that generate the waste (otherthan the plants where Method 1312 results exceed 100 times the MCLs), whichevernumber of plants is larger. andbullet; Constituent concentrations measured in waste sample extracts obtainedusing Method 1312 are used to determine facility-level values as follows:i. If data for only one sample of the waste are available, then these datadetermine the facility-level constituent concentrations; and ii. If data on two or more samples are available, then the lower boundof the 80 percent confidence interval of the mean of the data \1\<NOTE/> serves as the facility-level constituent concentrations,where the confidence interval is calculated for each waste for each constituentusing all results (from all plants generating the waste) available fromtesting of the waste using Method 1312.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The 80 percent confidence interval is recommended (guidance)in Chapter 9 on sampling in SW-846 as the confidence interval to be usedfor evaluating whether wastes pass or fail regulatory thresholds. Becausethe low hazard criterion is being used as a <T3>screening</T3> test to remove wastes that are clearly not low hazardfrom the Bevill exclusion, EPA is using the <T3>lower</T3> bound of the 80 percent confidence interval to compare withthe relevant standards. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. The pH Test </ITAG>A high volume mineral processing waste is not low hazard and, therefore,is not eligible for the temporary exclusion from subtitle C requirementsprovided by the Bevill Amendment under the following circumstances: andbullet; Fewer than five facilities generate the waste and the pH (determinedas required by 40 CFR 261.22) is less than one (1.0) or greater than 13.5at two or more facilities that generate the waste, or if five or more facilitiesgenerate the waste and the pH is less than one (1.0) or greater than 13.5at 50 percent or more of the facilities that generate the waste. andbullet; pH values measured for waste samples are used to determine facility-levelvalues for individual candidate low hazard wastes as follows:  i. If a datum for only one sample from a facility is available, this datumdetermines the facility-level pH; and ii. If data on two samples from a facility are available, the lower valuedetermines the facility-level pH; and iii. If data on more than two samples from a facility are available, themedian value defines the facility-level pH. <ITAG tagnum="85">III. Overview of Twenty Conditionally Retained Mineral ProcessingWastes </ITAG>This section provides brief descriptions of each of the conditionally retainedmineral processing wastes. The purpose of this discussion is to identifythe facilities and processing operations that generate the waste streams,and, where applicable, the component parts comprising particular wastestreams. EPA has previously conditionally retained these wastes withinthe Bevill exclusion, and today is proposing either to retain them withinor withdraw them from the exclusion, based upon the final high volume andlow hazard criteria discussed above. Accordingly, the Agency is not seekingpublic comment upon these waste descriptions, but only upon the volumeand hazard data underlying these proposed Bevill exclusion decisions. Toclarify the scope of this and previous notices, in today's proposal theAgency generally refers to specific wastes arising from ``processing''or ``production'' operations, as opposed to the more specific terminology(e.g., smelting, refining) used in the previous proposed and final rules.Thus, for example, copper or lead slags are generated by primary ``processing,''rather than by primary ``smelting'' or ``smelting/refining.'' A. Roast/Leach Ore Residue from Primary Chromite Production The primary chromite industry processes chromite ore to produce sodiumchromate and dichromate, the latter of which is the starting point formost chromium chemicals used in electroplating, chromium metal, pigments,dyes, inks, photography, leather and wood preserving. The hydrometallurgicalprocess involves roasting, leaching, neutralization with sulfuric acid,and filtering; insoluble dregs remain (i.e., the chromite ore roast/leachresidue) that are expected to contain traces of soluble chromium. Two companiesoperate one facility each that generates chromite ore roast/leach residue.B. Gasifier Ash from coal Gasification Coal gasification is the process of converting low grade coal and ligniteto synthetic natural gas of pipeline quality. The only commercial coalgasification plant in full operation in the United States is the DakotaGasification Company's Great Plains Coal Gasification Plant, located atBeulah, Mercer County, North Dakota. This plant employs the Lurgi HighPressure Coal Gasification Technology. Run-of-mine lignite coal is crushed and fed to each gasifier; steam andoxygen are introduced at the bottom of each gasifier to effect the coalgasification reactions. Ash discharged from the gasifiers is quenched andsluiced by a water jet down a sloped sluiceway to one of two wet wellsand then pumped to one of two dewatering bins. Water from the dewateringbins is recycled within the system and the dewatered <T3>gasifier ash, </T3>with a moisture content of approximately 15 percent,is discharged and trucked back to the mine for disposal. C. Process Wastewater from Coal Gasification Following the processing steps described above, the hot crude product gasleaving the gasifiers is cleaned of tar and dust by cooling in quench vessels,steam generators, and coolers (See ``B. Gasifier Ash from Coal Gasification''above for introduction and discussion of previous steps). The gas stream,which consists of methane, ethane, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide,carbon dioxide, and nitrogen, is then purified of hydrogen sulfide andcarbon dioxide. The purified gas is methanated to convert all the carbonmonoxide and a portion of the carbon dioxide by reaction with hydrogento produce methane. After the methanation step, the product gas is compressedand dried for delivery to the pipeline. The remaining gas liquor stream is referred to by the operator of thisfacility as ``stripped gas liquor or wastewater.'' The reported managementpractice is to include this process wastewater as part of the makeup waterdelivered to the cooling tower. D. Calcium Sulfate Wastewater Treatment Plant Sludge from Primary CopperProcessing Facilities that process copper ore concentrate generate various aqueouswaste streams which are typically treated; the effluent is often released,and the sludge is either disposed of or recycled to recover the mineralvalue. Two types of wastewater treatment are known to be employed at present.These two types, one using sodium hydroxide and the other using calciumoxide or hydroxide (lime), generate very different proportions of sludge,because sodium hydroxide typically precipitates very little sludge. Treatmentusing lime as the neutralizing agent generates a relatively large quantityof sludge known as calcium sulfate sludge. At least two facilities areknown to use lime and generate calcium sulfate wastewater treatment plantsludge. At least one other facility is known to use sodium hydroxide forwastewater treatment. E. Slag Tailings from Primary Copper Processing The process of smelting copper ores to fuse the metal value and separatethe bullion from the impurities generates slag. Often this slag containscopper at a higher percentage than the original ores. Consequently, severalcopper processing facilities reprocess this slag using beneficiation-likeactivities (e.g., crushing, grinding, washing, and flotation). As a resultof this reprocessing, or slag concentration, a residue referred to as slagtailings from primary copper processing is generated. According to industrysources, this material is presently managed along with tailings from beneficiationoperations, which are claimed to be very similar with respect to physicaland chemical characteristics. Two facilities are believed to generate slagtailings from primary copper processing. One smelter and refinery presentlyuses a Noranda slag concentrator; the other smelter and refinery employsa mill which crushes, grinds, and floats the slag from the flash furnace,thereby generating slag tailings. F. Furnace Off-Gas Solids from Elemental Phosphorus Production Elemental phosphorus is produced in five plants in Tennessee, Idaho, andMontana. The plants are supplied by nearby phosphate reserves which constitutetheir principal feed source. Phosphorus, obtained by reduction of phosphaterock, is oxidized to produce high purity phosphoric acid for specialtyuses and is converted into a variety of phosphorus-containing chemicalsand metallic phosphides. Sized phosphate rock, or sintered/agglomerated phosphate rock fines arecharged to an electric arc furnace together with coke as a reductant andsilica as a flux. The reduction generates a calcium silicate slag and ferrophosphorus,which are tapped, and carbon monoxide off-gases, which contain volatilizedphosphorus. This furnace off-gas materials stream is typically processedto remove impurities, which generates the furnace offgas solids. Phosphorusis removed from the gas stream by condensation in the presence of recirculatingwater above the melting point of phosphorus. The recirculating water isneutralized, and a purge of ``mud'' and soluble impurities is removed anddisposed; these are separate and may be distinguished from the furnaceoff-gas solids. Furnace off-gas solids are generally referred to as roasterresidue, evaporator residue, precipitator slurry, or treater dust, dependingon the method of processing the off-gas to remove impurities. G. Fluorogypsum from Hydrofluoric Acid Production Hydrofluoric acid, produced at three facilities in the United States, isused in a variety of chemical processing and manufacturing operations.In the production process, acid-grade fluorspar is reacted with sulfuricacid in a heated retort to produce hydrogen fluoride gas. This gas is purifiedby scrubbing, and the hydrogen fluoride gas is condensed. The chemicalis marketed as anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, a colorless fuming liquid,or it may be absorbed in water to form hydrofluoric acid, usually 70 percenthydrogen fluoride. The material remaining in the retort furnace is calciumsulfate, commonly known as fluorogypsum. This waste stream is stacked ingypsum stacks at one facility; treated, impounded, dredged, and landfilledat a second facility; and stacked and sold at a third facility. H. Process Wastewater from Hydrofluoric Acid Production The production of hydrofluoric acid results in the generation of largequantities of process wastewater from cooling, condensing, and fluorogypsumtransport (see ``G. Fluorogypsum from hydrofluoric acid production'' abovefor an introduction and process description). Much of the wastewater istypically recirculated to the system although part of this waste may betreated and discharged.I. Air Pollution Control Dust/Sludge from Iron Blast Furnaces Iron is a basic metal used in diverse industrial applications. Iron isa primary material for most land vehicles and mobile equipment, ships,and machinery, almost all large structures, tanks, pressure vessels, piping,and a variety of cans and containers. Iron is produced from ore either by blast furnaces or by one of severaldirect reduction processes. The modern blast furnace consists of a refractory-linedsteel shaft in which the charge is continuously added to the top througha gas seal and preheated air is blown through the tuyeres at the bosh nearthe bottom, to be emitted as combustible gas (top gas). Molten iron andslag are intermittently tapped from the hearth at the bottom. The top gasesemitted from the blast furnace must be treated before release. Air pollutioncontrol (APC) devices generate either APC dusts, in cases where baghousesor electrostatic precipitators are used, or APC sludges, in cases wherewet scrubbers are used. J. Iron Blast Furnace Slag Iron blast furnace slag, tapped from blast furnaces, is removed and eitherdisposed or processed and sold (see ``I. Air pollution control dust/sludgefrom iron blast furnaces'' above for the iron sector introduction and processdescription). K. Process Wastewater from Primary Lead Production Lead is ranked fifth in tonnage among major metals, after iron, copper,aluminum, and zinc. Major properties of the metal include: low meltingpoint, ease of casting, high density, low strength, ease of fabrication,acid resistance, and chemical stability. Traditional uses of lead includestorage batteries, and sheet lead or cable sheathing. Consumption of leadhas markedly declined recently because of the decline in the use of leadfor gasoline additives. Five lead facilities were operating in 1988, consistingof one smelter, one refinery, and three smelter/refineries. Lead processing includes smelting and refining. Smelting involves severalsuccessive processes that convert prepared lead ore concentrate into impurelead bullion ready for refining. Sintered lead ore is introduced into ablast furnace with coke, limestone, and other fluxing materials. Next,lead bullion is drossed. Finally, the drossed lead bullion is decopperized.The initial step in the refining process is softening. The softened leadbullion is then desilvered to remove gold and silver. Calcium and magnesiumare then added to remove bismuth. Finally, the lead bullion is mixed withfluxes to remove the remaining impurities. Process wastewater is generated at many points in the smelting and refiningof lead, and, for purposes of this rule, includes waters generated by slagor speiss granulation, contact cooling, and at some plants, neutralizedacid plant blowdown effluent. This waste stream does not, however, includewastewaters from upstream beneficiation operations such as sintering. Industrysources have indicated that solids are settled out and the water is reused.L. Air Pollution Control Dust/Sludge from Lightweight Aggregate ProductionLightweight aggregate is a building material that is used in concrete inplace of normal stone, and for other purposes. Concrete made with lightweightaggregate has about the same strength, but weighs approximately one-thirdless than normal concrete. Lightweight aggregate is made by heating certain types of clay, shale,and slate in a rotary kiln to a temperature of at least 1,950 anddegrees;F,forcing the materials to expand or ``bloat''. The rotary kilns that areused at lightweight aggregate facilities and the process itself are verysimilar to those employed in the production of cement and lime. During production operations, large volumes of gas leave the kiln, typicallycontaining particulate matter which must be removed using either dry collectiontechniques or wet scrubbers (i.e., APC dust/sludge). M. Process Wastewater From Primary Magnesium Processing by the AnhydrousProcess Magnesium, a light but relatively strong metal, is used as a componentof transportation equipment, castings, and wrought products. The largestuse of magnesium is in manufacturing aluminum-base alloys which in turnare used in applications such as beverage cans and auto parts. There are three active magnesium primary processing facilities in the UnitedStates. Two of the facilities use an electrolytic process, and one facilityuses a silicothermic process.The anhydrous process uses calcium chloride to remove impurities from thebrine. After removal of solid impurities, the solution is concentratedand then solidified as magnesium chloride crystals in a spray dryer. Aheated reactor is used to remove impurities and the resultant molten magnesiumchloride is sent to a electrolytic cell where crystals are formed. Themagnesium crystals are recast into ingots. Process wastewaters generatedduring the anhydrous process are acidic (pHandless;2) and are managed inevaporation ponds. N. Process Wastewater from Phosphoric Acid Production Commercial grade phosphoric acid from wet processing is used primarilyas a feedstock for the production of ammoniated fertilizers and in animalfeed, with a small portion going to chemical processing operations. Inthe wet method, the phosphate rock is dissolved in phosphoric acid, towhich sulfuric acid is added. The slurry from this operation is sent tofilters where the solids are collected, washed, and sent to phosphogypsumstacks. Process wastewaters are generated at several points in the wetprocess, including phosphogypsum transport, phosphoric acid concentration,and phosphoric acid temperature control and cooling (e.g., barometric condensersand flash coolers). O. Basic Oxygen Furnace and Open Hearth Furnace Air Pollution Control Dust/SludgeFrom Carbon Steel Production The steel industry is composed of three sectors. Large integrated steelcompanies_with blast furnaces able to produce iron and basic oxygen furnacesfurther processing iron into steel_account for approximately 80 percentof the raw steel production. This sector produces much of the iron ore,coal, and limestone needed in its plants. The capacity of these plantshas been reduced over the past few years. Minimills, or market mills, typicallyuse electric furnaces and continuous casting to produce a limited rangeof products from scrap; specialty mills produce relatively small quantitiesof high quality, high value products. Neither of these last two sectortypes produce Bevill wastes because they do not typically use ores or mineralsas their primary feedstock(s). All contemporary steelmaking processes convertiron, scrap, or direct-reduced iron, or mixtures of these, into steel bya refining process that lowers the carbon and silicon content and removesimpurities, mainly phosphorus and sulfur. The excess oxygen is then neutralizedby adding deoxidizing elements such as manganese, silicon, or aluminum.Exhaust gas from the open hearth and basic oxygen furnaces is scrubbedto remove gases and particulate matter. The scrubbers may be dry collectiondevices, resulting in air pollution control dust or wet scrubbers, resultingin a sludge (i.e., APC dust/sludge). P. Basic Oxygen Furnace and Open Hearth Furnace Slag from Carbon SteelProduction In the open hearth process_the dominant steelmaking method in the U.S.between 1908 and 1969_a relatively shallow bath of metal is heated by aflame that passes over the bath from burners at one end of the furnacewhile the hot gases resulting from combustion are used at the other endof the furnace to heat checker-brick regenerators (see ``O. Basic oxygenfurnace and open hearth furnace Air Pollution Control Dust/Sludge fromcarbon steel production'' for additional process details). Slag is generatedduring the refining process and is removed and sold or disposed. The most recently developed steelmaking process is the basic oxygen process.In this process, a jet of pure oxygen is injected into the molten metalby a lance of regulated height in a basic refractory-lined converter. Excesscarbon, silicon, and other reactive elements are oxidized during the controlledblows, and fluxes are added to form a slag which is removed and processedand sold or disposed. Q. Sulfate Process Waste Acids from Titanium Dioxide Production Titanium dioxide is the major end product manufactured from the processingof titanium-bearing minerals, principally ilmenite and rutile. In addition,synthetic rutile and titanium-bearing slags are used as a feedstock forproducing titanium dioxide pigment. Environmental problems associated withthe sulfate process led to a closure of several sulfate pigment plantsand conversion to chloride process technology at other facilities; in theUnited States most of the production (nine of 11 plants) is by the chlorideprocess (though sulfate processes generate half the world's production).About 50 percent of the total U.S. consumption of TiO<T2>2</T2> is used in paints, while about 25 percent is used in paper coating.Plastics markets have been increasingly important and constitute about18 percent of the U.S. consumption. The sulfate process is currently used by two companies, each owning oneplant. The process uses ilmenite, treated with strong sulfuric acid attemperatures up to 180 anddegrees;C, as a feedstock. The resultant reactionproduces hydrated iron sulfate and titanium oxysulfate (TiOSO<T2>4</T2>). The sludge is removed, and the liquid is evaporated in a vacuum.After cooling, the crystallized hydrous iron sulfate is filtered, and thefiltrate concentrated to over 200 gm/l. Low-temperature heating of theTiOSO<T2>4</T2> solution results in hydrolysis to titanyl hydroxide (TiO(OH)<T2>2</T2>) and sulfuric acid, a major waste acid stream. The precipitateis washed with water and weak sulfuric acid, a second waste acid stream,to remove trace elements (particularly heavy metals) and calcined to TiO<T2>2</T2> at 1,000 anddegrees;C. The highly acidic waste streams of thesulfate process and residual solids are the primary waste streams fromthis process. R. Sulfate Process Waste Solids from Titanium Dioxide Production Waste acids from the sulfate process are filtered, generating residualsolids (see ``Q. Sulfate processing waste acids from titanium dioxide production''for the introduction and process description). S. Chloride Process Waste Solids from Titanium Tetrachloride ProductionTitanium tetrachloride is the major end product manufactured from the processingof titanium-bearing minerals, principally ilmenite and rutile. In addition,synthetic rutile and titanium-bearing slags are used as a feedstock forproducing titanium tetrachloride. Most of the titanium tetrachloride isused to produce titanium dioxide, the remainder is used to produce titaniummetal or chemicals. One firm operates four titanium tetrachloride plants,while another operates three facilities, and four others operate one each.Three of the companies that own only one plant principally produce titaniummetal. The chloride process involves fluidized roasting and chlorination of rutile,synthetic rutile, slag, or beneficiated ilmenites at about 1,000 anddegrees;C.The product formed is a titanium tetrachloride. This is a volatile chlorideand is collected. The nonvolatile chlorides are disposed. Further purificationincludes the separation of volatile vanadium oxychloride by mineral oilcomplexing and H<T2>2</T2>S reduction. To form titanium dioxide, the purified TiCl<T2>4</T2> is oxidized with fuel and air at 985 anddegrees;C, and the chlorinegas is recycled. Waste solids are generated as part of the acid streamfrom air pollution control treatment of off-gases. T. Slag from Primary Zinc Processing Zinc is used in many industries for several purposes. The constructionindustry accounts for approximately 45 percent of zinc consumption, followedby transportation, 20 percent; machinery, 10 percent; electrical, 10 percent;and chemical and other industries 15 percent. Slab zinc is primarily usedfor galvanizing and electrogalvanizing, as well as zinc-base alloys, brassand bronze alloys, and rolled zinc. Zinc metal production uses either electrolytic techniques or pyrometallurgicaltechniques to produce slab from unrefined ore. Only one facility currentlyproduces zinc using pyrometallurgy. The pyrometallurgical zinc smeltingprocess uses a retort and condensation operation. The zinc concentrateis first roasted, then sintered. The sinter product is retorted in a furnace,which drives the zinc off in gaseous form. The zinc is condensed and refined.The material remaining in the retort furnace is the primary zinc processingslag. Part of this slag is re-processed to recover mineral values, whilethe remainder is disposed. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Application of Bevill Exclusion Criteria </ITAG>EPA applied the Bevill exclusion criteria to each of the 20 conditionallyretained mineral processing wastes in a three-step process. First, theAgency applied the high volume criteria to the available waste generationdata for the 20 wastes. In the second step, the Agency applied the lowhazard criterion to the available waste characteristics data for the wastes.Finally, the Agency combined the results from the first two steps to determinethe proposed Bevill status of the 20 conditionally retained mineral processingwastes. Each step is discussed separately below. A. High Volume Criterion <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Methodology </ITAG>There were two major sources of waste generation data for the 20 conditionallyretained mineral processing wastes: EPA's 1989 National Survey of SolidWastes from Mineral Processing Facilities, and data submitted in responseto EPA's requests for public comments published in recent proposed mineralwaste rulemakings. As EPA explained in the September 1 final rule, theAgency conditionally retained all wastes which appeared to meet the highvolume criterion based upon information submitted in public comments onthe October and April NPRMs. Since, however, the data in these public commentswas unsworn and unverified, EPA committed to evaluating the National Surveydata for this proposal to confirm the information found in public comment.The National Survey data were not available in time for use in the September1 final rule. EPA conducted the National Survey of Solid Wastes from Mineral ProcessingFacilities during 1989 under the authority of RCRA andSection;andSection; 3001and 3007. These Sections give EPA the power to require facilities to furnishinformation about their generation and management of certain solid wastes(as defined in CFR Part 261) for use in regulatory development. This pastspring, EPA collected data from over 200 facilities, focusing on 47 wastesgenerated or received by mineral processing facilities that the Agencythought, at the time, might be large volume wastes. The data collectedinclude general facility information (e.g., ownership, location, and mineralprocessing operations); waste generation characteristics; processing units,wastewater treatment plants, surface impoundments, and other residualsmanagement units that receive a candidate special waste; environmentalmonitoring; and other related information. The data only cover waste generationand management practices occurring in 1988. The second source of data consists of data voluntarily submitted to theAgency by the mineral processing industry in comments on recent rulemakings.The 47 special wastes included in the survey reflected the Agency's viewof the universe of potential Bevill wastes at the time of the developmentof the survey instrument in the fall of 1988. Since that time, the Agencyhas added several wastes to the list of candidate special wastes, oftenin response to data submitted by the mineral processing industry_thesewastes, therefore, were not included in the survey. In these cases, theAgency relied on the industry-supplied data in order to make its determinationof Bevill status. In addition, the Agency used the industry-supplied datato supplement the data obtained in the survey in order to determine thehighest average annual generation rate between 1983 and 1988.For each of the conditionally retained wastes, EPA divided the total 1988sector-wide waste generation quantity obtained in the survey by the numberof facilities that generated the waste during 1988. For wastes that didnot meet the high volume threshold for 1988, EPA analyzed the responsesto the survey questionnaire in more detail, to determine whether the 1988data might be anomalous (e.g., production and waste generation rates werebelow normal due to plant renovations or labor strikes). The Agency thenreviewed the information submitted in public comment (the basis for manyof the proposed conditional exclusions) in an attempt to reconcile anysignificant discrepancies. In cases where normalized waste generation dataas reported for 1988 are in reasonable agreement with the information submittedin public comment, the Agency has accepted the waste generation rates providedby commenters and concluded that the waste(s) in question pass the highvolume criterion. In cases where these data are not in agreement, however,EPA has tentatively concluded that the materials in question are not highvolume mineral processing wastes, and, accordingly, has proposed to removethem from the Bevill exclusion in today's notice. The data and calculationsunderlying EPA's determinations of high and low volume mineral processingwastes are presented in a background document that may be found in thedocket for this proposed rule. Representatives of facilities that generate wastes that have been proposedfor removal from Bevill on the basis of volume that believe that the datathat they submitted for 1988 do not reflect waste generation rates throughoutthe period from 1983 to 1988 must submit information fully documentingthis claim by the close of the public comment period for this proposalNovember 9, 1989. Documentation should include a description of the productionprocess(es) generating the waste (a process flow diagram is strongly recommended),the specific point(s) in the mineral processing sequence that give riseto the waste, the waste generation rate and physical state (including percentsolids), and management practice information (through final dispositionof the material in question). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Results of Applying the High Volume Criterion </ITAG>Table 1 summarizes the results of applying the high volume criterion tothe available waste generation data for the 20 conditionally retained wastes.The average waste generation data reported in Table 1 do not, in all cases,reflect information collected from all facilities generating a particularwaste, because in responding to the National Survey, many facility operatorsdesignated their waste generation rates Confidential Business Information(CBI). In no case, however, would including CBI waste generation data inthis table influence the results of EPA's application of the high volumecriterion, i.e., the CBI data in EPA's possession support the determinationsthat the Agency has made here regarding compliance with the Bevill mineralprocessing wastes high volume criterion. Of the 14 non-liquid mineral processing wastes, only two were not generatedat an average annual rate greater than 45,000 metric tons per year, duringone or more years between 1983 and 1988. These two wastes, therefore, failthe high volume criteria and do not qualify for the Bevill exclusion: 1. Furnace off-gas solids from elemental phosphorus production 2. Sulfate process waste solids from titanium dioxide production Of the six liquid mineral processing wastes, three were not generated atan average annual rate greater than 1,000,000 metric tons per year, duringat least one year between 1983 and 1988. These wastes, therefore, failthe high volume criteria and do not qualify for the Bevill exclusion: 1. Process wastewater from coal gasification 2. Process wastewater from hydrofluoric acid production 3. Process wastewater from primary lead processing In summary, 15 of the 20 conditionally retained wastes satisfy the highvolume criterion. The Agency proposes to remove the conditional Bevillstatus for the five low volume wastes listed above.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 1._<T4>Results of Applying the High Volume Criterion to Twenty ConditionallyRetained Mineral Processing Wastes*</T4><H1>Commodity sector</H1><H1>Conditionally retained waste</H1><H1>Solid or liquid</H1><H1>Average per facility generation (mt/yr)</H1><H1>Notes</H1><H1>No. of facilities reporting</H1><H1>Passes high volume criterion</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromite <D>Roast/Leach Ore Residue </D><D>Solid </D><D>W/H </D><D>A,B </D><D>2 </D><D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Coal Gas <D>Gasifier Ash </D><D>Solid </D><D>244,940 </D><D>B </D><D>1 </D><D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Coal Gas <D>Process Wastewater </D><D>Liquid </D><D>598,030 </D><D>C </D><D>1 </D><D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper <D>Calcium Sulfate Wastewater Treatment Plant Sludge </D><D>Solid </D><D>1,179,341 </D><D>A,B </D><D>2 </D><D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper <D>Slag Tailings </D><D>Solid </D><D>1,028,684 </D><D>C </D><D>2 </D><D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Elemental Phosphorus <D>Furnace Off-gas Solids </D><D>Solid </D><D>4,885 </D><D>A,C </D><D>5 </D><D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hydrofluoric Acid <D>Fluorogypsum </D><D>Solid </D><D>266,564 </D><D>C </D><D>2 </D><D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hydrofluoric Acid <D>Process Wastewater </D><D>Liquid </D><D>n/a </D><D>C </D><D>0 </D><D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Iron <D>Air Pollution Control Dust/Sludge </D><D>Solid </D><D>88,263 </D><D>B,C </D><D>24 </D><D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Iron <D>Blast Furnace Slag </D><D>Solid </D><D>742,198 </D><D>B </D><D>25 </D><D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>Process Wastewater </D><D>Liquid </D><D>785,562 </D><D>A,C </D><D>5 </D><D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">LIghtweight Aggregate <D>Air Pollution Control Dust/Sludge </D><D>Solid </D><D>134,065 </D><D>B,C </D><D>6 </D><D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Magnesium <D>Anhydrous Process Wastewater </D><D>Liquid </D><D>2,464,822 </D><D>B </D><D>1 </D><D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phosphoric Acid <D>Process Wastewater </D><D>Liquid </D><D>56,359,141 </D><D>B,C </D><D>21 </D><D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Steel <D>Basic Oxygen Furnace and Open Hearth Furnace Air Pollution Control Dust/Sludge</D><D>Solid </D><D>66,069 </D><D>B,C </D><D>4 </D><D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Steel <D>Basic Oxygen Furnace and Open Hearth Furnace Slag </D><D>Solid </D><D>533,771 </D><D>B </D><D>24 </D><D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Titanium Dioxide <D>Sulfate Process Waste Acids </D><D>Liquid </D><D>W/H </D><D>A,B </D><D>2 </D><D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Titanium Dioxide <D>Sulfate Process Waste Solids </D><D>Solid </D><D>W/H </D><D>A,C </D><D>1 </D><D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Titanium Tetrachloride <D>Chloride Process Waste Solids </D><D>Solid </D><D>85,788 </D><D>A,B </D><D>9 </D><D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zinc <D>Slag </D><D>Solid </D><D>156,943 </D><D>B </D><D>1 </D><D>Yes. </D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total Number of Wastes Meeting High Volume Criterion </ITAG><D>15.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Total Number of Wastes Failing High Volume Criterion </ITAG><D>5.</D><F>*Data are from 1989 National Survey of Solid Wastes from Mineral ProcessingFacilities.</F><F>W/H_withheld to avoid disclosing confidential business information (CBI).</F><F>A.

Methodology </ITAG>During the summer of 1989, EPA collected samples of each of the 20 conditionallyretained mineral processing wastes. For each waste, EPA took at least onesample from each of two or more of the facilities currently generatingthe waste, unless there was only one generator. For each liquid sample,EPA conducted a pH test, and for every liquid and non-liquid sample, theAgency analyzed the potential waste constituent mobility and toxicity usingMethod 1312. If the testing results indicated that one or more samples of a given wasteexceeded one or more of the regulatory levels (100 times the MCLs) presentedin the low hazard criterion, EPA applied the statistical test outlinedabove in Section II.C to determine the status of the waste with respectto the low hazard criterion. If no samples exceeded the regulatory levels,EPA considered the waste low hazard. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Results of Applying the Low Hazard Criterion to Individual WasteStreams </ITAG>In the following paragraphs, EPA discusses the coverage and results ofthe waste sampling and analysis activities that have been conducted insupport of this rulemaking. These results focus on data obtained usingEPA's Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP), also referredto as ``Method 1312.'' For clarity, the discussion emphasizes, but is notlimited to, test results of individual waste samples collected at the facilitiesvisited in EPA's waste sampling program, rather than results derived fromcomparisons of the 80th percent lower confidence interval (calculated fromall samples across the sector) with the appropriate regulatory levels (theprocedure used to implement the low hazard criterion). The data and calculationsunderlying EPA's determinations of high and low hazard mineral processingwastes are presented in a background document that may be found in thedocket for today's proposed rule. <T3>a. Roast/Leach Ore Residue from Primary Chromite Production. </T3>Twofacilities were included in the sampling study; however, the data fromone facility are CBI and cannot be reported. One sample of residue wascollected and analyzed from the non-CBI facility. All constituents exceptbarium and chromium were below detectable limits. Barium levels for thisfacility were below 1 percent of the regulatory level, while chromium valueswere detected at nearly 1,700 percent of the regulatory level (100 timesthe MCLs). The lower 80th percent confidence interval for total chromiumconcentrations, as applied to the waste at both facilities, indicates thatthis waste fails the low hazard criterion at each of the two facilitiesthat generate it. Accordingly, EPA is today proposing to remove roast/leachore residue from primary chromite production from the Bevill exclusive.<T3>b. Gasifier Ash From Coal Gasification. </T3>One coal gasificationfacility was included in the sampling study. From this facility, two samplesof ash were collected and analyzed. Most constitutents were not above detectablelevels. Arsenic and barium, however, were found in detectable quantities,although well below regulatory levels (100 times the MCLs). The SPLP procedureshowed levels at about four percent of the regulatory level for arsenic,while for barium the procedure showed detectable levels below 1 percentof the regulatory level (100 times the MCLs). Because of Method 1312 constituentconcentrations exceed 100 times MCLs for this waste, EPA concludes thatit passes the low hazard criterion. <T3>c. Process Wastewater From Coal Gasification. </T3>From the coal gasificationfacility visited in the sampling study, three wastewater samples from differentareas were collected and analyzed. Most constituents measured were belowdetectable limits for the SPLP method, but some detectable levels werenoted. The SPLP procedure for arsenic showed levels up to about 4 percentof the regulatory level. The SPLP procedures for barium and mercury onlyranged up to below 1 percent of the regulatory level. Selenium levels wereas high as 95 percent of the regulatory level. Because no Method 1312 constituentconcentrations exceed 100 times MCLs for this waste and because no fieldpH measurements were below 1.0, EPA concludes that it passes the low hazardcriterion. <T3>d. Calcium Sulfate Wastewater Treatment Plant Sludge From Primary CopperProcessing. </T3>Two facilities were included in the sampling study; thedata from one facility, however, are Confidential Business Information(CBI) and cannot be reported. One sample of sludge was collected and analyzedfrom the non-CBI facility. Again, most constituents measured were belowdetectable limits. The arsenic concentration obtained using the SPLP procedureshowed levels at about 30 percent of the regulatory level. Barium was measuredat below 1 percent of the regulatory level, while lead and mercury werenot detectable in the SPLP procedure. Selenium concentrations in the SPLPprocedure extract were almost 90 percent of the regulatory level. Becauseno Method 1312 constituent concentrations exceed 100 times MCLs for thiswaste, EPA concludes that it passes the low hazard criterion.<T3>e. Slag Tailings from Primary Copper Processing. </T3>Two primary coppersmelters were included in the sampling study. From each facility, one sampleof slag tailings was collected and analyzed. Most constitutents measuredwere below detectable limits using the SPLP method, but some detectablelevels were noted (e.g., for lead). Because no Method 1312 constituentconcentrations exceed 100 times MCLs for this waste, EPA concludes thatit passes the low hazard criterion. <T3>f. Furnace Off-Gas Solids From Elemental Phosphorus Production. </T3>Twofacilities were included in the sampling study. One sample of off-gas solidsfrom each facility was collected and analyzed. Most constituents were belowdetectable limits using the SPLP method, but some detectable levels werenoted. The SPLP procedure for cadmium generated values from about 5 percentup to 249 percent of the regulatory level (100 times the MCL). Lead analysisconcentrations ranged from about 10 to 20 percent of the regulatory level.Because the lower 80th percentile confidence limit for all constituentconcentrations was below 100 times MCLs for this waste, EPA concludes thatit passes the low hazard criterion. <T3>g. Fluorogypsum from Hydrofluoric Acid Production. </T3>Three facilitieswere included in the sampling study. One sample of fluorogypsum from eachfacility was collected and analyzed. Most constituents were below detectablelimits. Barium was found at below 1 percent of the regulatory level (100times the MCLs) in the SPLP procedure. Cadmium levels ranged from belowdetectable to 6 percent of the regulatory levels in the three samples.Chromium and lead levels were similar, ranging from below detection upto about 60 percent of the regulatory level. Mercury was found in concentrationsof about 2 percent of the regulatory level in the SPLP procedure. Becauseno Method 1312 constituent concentrations exceed 100 times MCLs for thiswaste, EPA concludes that it passes the low hazard criterion. <T3>h. Process Wastewater From Hydrofluoric Acid Production. </T3>Two facilitieswere included in the sampling study. One sample of wastewater from eachfacility was collected and analyzed. Most constituents were below detectablelimits. Arsenic levels ranged from 2 up to 20 percent of the regulatorylevel (100 times the MCLs), while barium levels were at or below 1 percentof the regulatory level. Chromium concentrations were from 20 to 56 percentof the regulatory level in both procedures. Lead was found from 10 to 61percent of the regulatory level for the SPLP procedure. Mercury levelswere below 1 percent of the regulatory level. Because no Method 1312 constituentconcentrations exceed 100 times MCLs for this waste, and because all pHmeasurements of the waste were greater than 1.0, EPA concludes that itpasses the low hazard criterion. <T3>i. Air Pollution Control Dust/Sludge From Iron Blast Furnaces. </T3>Fourfacilities were included in the sampling study. One sample from each ofthree facilities, and two samples from the remaining facility were collectedand analyzed, for a total of five samples. Most constituents were belowdetectable limits for the SPLP method. Barium levels ranged from belowdetection to about 1 percent of the regulatory level. Cadmium and leadwere not detected. Mercury levels ranged from below detection up to 1 percentof the regulatory level. Because no Method 1312 constituent concentrationsexceed 100 times MCLs for this waste, EPA concludes that it passes thelow hazard criterion. <T3>j. Iron Blast Furnace Slag. </T3>Four facilities were included in thesampling study. One sample of slag from each of two facilities was collectedand analyzed, while two samples from the third facility, and three samplesfrom the remaining facility, were collected and analyzed, for a total ofseven samples. Most constituents were below detectable limits. Barium andmercury levels ranged from below detection to about 1 percent of the regulatorylevels. Because no Method 1312 constituent concentrations exceed 100 timesMCLs for this waste, EPA concludes that it passes the low hazard criterion.<T3>k. Process Wastewater from Primary Lead Processing. </T3>Three facilitieswere included in the sampling study. From each facility, one sample ofwastewater was collected and analyzed. Most constituents measured werebelow detectable limits. Arsenic levels ranged from two to 400 percentof the regulatory level (100 times the MCLs). Barium concentrations werebelow three percent of the regulatory level when detected. Cadmium levelsranged from 33 percent up to almost 700 percent of the regulatory level.Lead ranged from about five percent up to about 145 percent of the regulatorylevel. Mercury concentrations were generally not detectable, and did notexceed 1 percent of the regulatory level otherwise. Selenium levels rangedfrom below detection up to about 13 percent of the regulatory level. Allfield pH measurements were above 1.0. Because the lower 80th percentileconfidence limit for a constituent exceeds regulatory levels at two differentfacilities (arsenic and cadmium, respectively), i.e., two facilities failthe low hazard criterion, EPA tentatively concludes that this waste streamfails the low hazard criterion. <T3>l. Air Pollution Control Sludge/Solids From Lightweight Aggregate Production.</T3>Two facilities were included in the sampling study; however, the datafrom one facility are CBI and cannot be reported. One sample of sludgewas collected and analyzed from the non-CBI facility. Again, all constituentsexcept barium were below detectable limits using the SPLP method. Bariumlevels for this facility were below 1 percent of the regulatory level.Because no Method 1312 constituent concentrations exceed 100 times MCLsfor this waste, EPA concludes that it passes the low hazard criterion.<T3>m. Process Wastewater From Primary Magnesium Processing by the AnhydrousProcess. </T3>One primary magnesium processing facility was included inthe sampling study. From this facility, one sample of wastewater was collectedand analyzed. Most constituents were not above detectable levels. Barium,chromium, and lead were below detection. Mercury was detected in the sample,but at less than 1 percent of the regulatory level. Because no Method 1312constituent concentrations exceed 100 times MCLs for this waste, and becauseall field pH measurements were above 1.0, EPA concludes that the wastepasses the low hazard criterion. <T3>n. Process Wastewater From Phosphoric Acid Production. </T3>Two facilitieswere included in the sampling study. Three samples of wastewater from onefacility, and four samples from the other facility were collected and analyzed,for a total of seven samples. Most constituents were below detectable limits.Arsenic levels ranged from below detectable to about 38 percent of theregulatory level, while barium concentrations ranged from below detectionup to about 1 percent of regulatory levels. Cadmium and chromium concentrationsranged from about 20 percent up to about 60 percent of the regulatory levels.Lead values ranged from below detection up to about 3 percent of the regulatorylevel. Mercury concentrations were below detection limits. Because no Method1312 constituent concentrations exceed 100 times MCLs for this waste, andbecause all field pH measurements were above 1.0, EPA concludes that thewaste passes the low hazard criterion. <T3>o. Basic Oxygen and Open Hearth Furnace Air Pollution Control Dust/SludgeFrom Carbon Steel Production. </T3>Three facilities were included in thesampling study. One sample from each of the first two facilities and twosamples from the third facility were collected and analyzed, for a totalof four samples. Most constituents were below detectable limits. When bariumand mercury levels were detectable, they remained below 1 percent of theregulatory levels. Cadmium and lead concentrations were below detection.Because no Method 1312 constituent concentrations exceed 100 times MCLsfor this waste, EPA concludes that it passes the low hazard criterion.<T3>p. Basic Oxygen and Open Hearth Furnace Slag From Carbon Steel Production.</T3>Three facilities were included in the sampling study. One slag samplefrom the first facility, two samples from the second facility, and threesamples from the third facility were collected and analyzed, for a totalof six samples. Most constituents were below detectable limits. Bariumand mercury concentrations ranged from below detection to well below 1percent of the regulatory levels. Selenium was below detection. Becauseno Method 1312 constituent concentrations exceed 100 times MCLs for thiswaste, EPA concludes that it passes the low hazard criterion. <T3>q. Sulfate Process Waste Acids From Titanium Dioxide Production. </T3>Twofacilities were included in the sampling study. From each facility, onesample of waste acids was collected and analyzed. Most constituents werebelow detectable limits. Chromium levels, however, were found to rangefrom about 700 percent to 1600 percent of the regulatory level, i.e., exceededthe regulatory level at both facilities. Concentrations of selenium alsoexceed the criterion at one facility. This waste, as sampled, also hadan extremely low pH. Because of this uniformly low pH (andless; 1) and therelatively high metals concentrations, EPA has tentatively concluded thatthis waste fails the low hazard criterion. <T3>r. Sulfate Process Waste Solids From Titanium Dioxide Production. </T3>Twofacilities were included in the sampling study. From each facility, onesample of waste solids was collected and analyzed. Concentrations of allconstituents evaluated for the low hazard criterion were below detectablelimits and regulatory levels. Because no Method 1312 constituent concentrationsexceed 100 times the MCLs for this waste, EPA concludes that it passesthe low hazard criterion. <T3>s. Chloride Process Waste Solids From Titanium Tetrachloride Production.</T3>Three facilities were included in the sampling study. From each facility,one sample of waste solids was collected and analyzed. Most constituentsmeasured were below detectable limits. Barium levels ranged from belowdetectable up to 2.5 percent of the regulatory level (100 times the MCLs).Chromium levels ranged from below detection up to 2,000 percent of theregulatory levels. Lead levels ranged from below detection up to about1,000 percent of the regulatory level. Even when mercury levels were detectablein the SPLP procedure, they did not exceed 1 percent of the regulatorylevel. Silver levels were generally below detection for both procedures,but did range up to 30 percent of the regulatory level in the SPLP procedure.Importantly, the constituent concentrations that exceeded regulatory levelsfor this waste all came from the same sample, and only the lower 80th percentconfidence intervals for constituents applied to this facility exceed regulatorylevels. Therefore, because only one facility failed the low hazard criterionwhile two facilities passed, EPA has concluded that this waste stream passesthe low hazard criterion. <T3>t. Slag From Primary Zinc Processing. </T3>The single facility fromthis sector known to generate this waste was included in the sampling study.From this facility, one sample of slag was collected and analyzed. Onlyone constituent (barium) was found at detectable levels, but its concentrationwas below 1 percent of the regulatory level. Because no Method 1312 constituentconcentrations exceed 100 times MCLs for this waste, EPA concludes thatit passes the low hazard criterion. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Summary of Results </ITAG>Table 2 summarizes the results of applying the low hazard criterion tothe available waste generation data for the 20 conditionally retained wastes.The sampling data indicate that all but three of these wastes satisfy thelow hazard criterion.

Consolidation of Results In order for a mineral processing waste to qualify for continued retentionin the Bevill exclusion, it must meet both the high volume and the lowhazard criteria. Combining the results from the volume and hazard assessmentsyields the proposed list of temporarily excluded mineral processes wastes,which are presented and discussed in section V, below.<ITAG tagnum="85">V. Proposed Bevill Status of Twenty Conditionally Retained MineralProcessing Wastes</ITAG>A. Wastes Proposed for Retention within the ExclusionBased on applying the Bevill exclusion criteria to the available data foreach of the 20 conditionally retained wastes, EPA proposes to retain 13mineral processing wastes within the exclusion, and remove the remainingseven. The proposed status of each of the 20 wastes and the basis for EPA'sproposed Bevill exclusion decisions are presented in Table 3. The listof temporarily excluded Bevill mineral processing wastes in the proposedregulatory language below (40 CFR 261.4(b)(7) (i)-(xviii)) includes 18wastes: the five retained in the September 1 final rule and the 13 proposedfor retention today.B.

Regulatory Implementation and Effective Dates of the Final Rule</ITAG>In accordance with the March 14, 1989 order of the U.S. Court of Appealsfor the D.C. Circuit, EPA intends to finalize this proposed rule by January15, 1990. (See <T3>Environmental Defense Fund </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>852 F.2d 1316 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). As of the effective dateof the final rule (i.e., six months after the final rule appears in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>), all mineral processing wastes that have beenconditionally excluded from regulation under Subtitle C of RCRA since 1980,except the thirteen wastes described above in Section V, may be subjectto Subtitle C requirements in those states that do not have authorizationto administer their own hazardous wastes program in lieu of EPA. Generators,transporters, and treatment, storage, and disposal (TSD) facilities inauthorized states will be subject to RCRA requirements imposed as a resultof the final rule only after the state revises its program to adopt equivalentrequirements and EPA authorizes the revision.The requirements imposed as a result of removing the temporary exclusioninclude: determining whether the solid waste(s) exhibit hazardous characteristics(40 CFR 262.11) and, for those wastes that are hazardous; obtaining anEPA identification number for managing hazardous wastes (40 CFR 262.34);complying with recordkeeping and reporting requirements (40 CFR 262.40-262.43);and obtaining interim status and seeking a permit (or modifying interimstatus, including permit applications or modifying a permit, as appropriate)(40 CFR Part 270).A. Section 3010 NotificationNot later than 90 days after publication of the final rule, all personswho generate, transport, treat, store, or dispose of wastes that are removedfrom temporary exclusion by that rule and are characteristically hazardousunder 40 CFR part 261 subpart C will be required to notify either EPA oran authorized state of these activities pursuant to section 3010 of RCRA.Notification instructions are set forth in 45 FR 12746. Persons who previouslyhave notified EPA or an authorized state of their activities pursuant toSection 3010 of RCRA, i.e., persons who previously have notified EPA oran authorized state that they generate, transport, treat, store or disposeof hazardous waste and have received an identification number (see 40 CFR262.12, 263.11 and 265.1) need not re-notify.\2\<NOTE/> Persons without EPA identification numbers are prohibitedfrom transporting, offering for transport, treating, storing, or disposingof hazardous wastes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Under the Solid Waste Disposal Amendments of 1980, (Pub.L. 96-462) EPA was given the option of waiving the notification requirementunder section 3010 of RCRA following revision of the section 3001 regulations,at the discretion of the Administrator.The Agency views the section 3010 notification requirements to be necessaryin this case because it believes that many persons that manage the wastescoming into subtitle C regulation today have not previously notified EPAand received an EPA identification number. B. Definition of Designated Facility The Agency has received a number of inquiries regarding waste shipmentsfrom a state where a waste is subject to hazardous waste regulations toa state where the waste is not yet regulated as hazardous. This situationcan arise when EPA lists or identifies a new waste as hazardous under itspre-HSWA authority. In such a case, the waste is subject to RCRA hazardouswaste regulations only in those states that do not have interim or finalauthorization to operate the RCRA program. In a state authorized by EPAto operate a hazardous waste program in lieu of the Federal program underthe authority of section 3006 of RCRA, the waste would not be subject toRCRA requirements until the state revises its program to classify the wasteas hazardous and receives authorization for these requirements. This setof circumstances results from the fact that RCRA allows states a specifiedtime to adopt new regulations in order to minimize disruptions to the implementationof authorized state programs. In contrast, this situation does not occurwhen the wastes are newly listed or identified pursuant to the HSWA authoritiessince Congress specified that HSWA provisions are to be implemented byEPA in all states until such time as states are authorized to implementthe new regulations. There are two recent EPA rulemakings that listed or identified additionalwastes pursuant to pre-HSWA authority: (1) Six Metal Smelting Wastes, 53FR 35412, September 13, 1988, and (2) Bevill Mining Waste Exclusion finalrule 54 FR 36592, September 1, 1989. In addition, today's proposed ruleon the 20 conditionally exempt Bevill wastes could lead to a final rulethat brings additional wastes into RCRA Subtitle C jurisdiction. Thesethree rulemakings will result in the scenario described above. Generators of hazardous waste have asked the Agency whether they can shipthe waste to a facility in a state where it is not regulated as hazardousand, if so, how they should manifest their waste. EPA's generator regulationsrequire a generator of hazardous waste to ``designate on the manifest onefacility which is permitted to handle the waste described on the manifest.''(See 40 CFR 260.20). The regulations clearly state that the facility designatedon the manifest is the ``designated facility'' as defined in andSection;260.10. (See the direct reference in the definition of ``designated facility''to the manifest requirement in andSection; 262.20.) A designated facility as currently defined in 40 CFR 260.10 must either(1) have an EPA permit (or interim status) in accordance with Parts 270and 124, (2) have a permit from a State authorized in accordance with part271, or (3) be a recycling facility that is regulated under andSection; 261.6(c)(2)or subpart F of part 266, and must also be designated on the manifest bythe generator pursuant to andSection; 262.20. It has become apparent thatwhen promulgated in 1980, the definition of ``designated facility'' didnot contemplate the above situation which has potentially broad impactson the RCRA program. EPA's current interpretation of this manifest requirementis that the authorized state determines which facilities are allowed toaccept the waste. However, since questions on this issue have arisen, theAgency is using this opportunity to seek public comment and, based on thesecomments, to promulgate clearer regulatory language. The Agency has decided to propose a clarification of the definition of``designated facility'' to alleviate any confusion that the public andthe regulated community may have over its applicability. Today's proposalwould provide that if a waste is sent to an authorized State where thewaste is not considered hazardous, then the designated facility must bea facility allowed, by the State, to accept the waste. This regulatorychange would only apply to the situation where a hazardous waste in onestate is shipped to a second state that has not yet been authorized toregulate the waste as hazardous. The effect of the proposed rule changewould be to clarify the Agency's position that the management standardsof the receiving state are the standards applicable to the treatment, storage,or disposal of the waste. It should be further emphasized that the effect of this new provision wouldbe limited to a temporary period of time following an EPA regulatory actionthat newly identifies a hazardous waste pursuant to pre-HSWA authority.All authorized states are required to adopt EPA's new waste listings andidentifications by specified deadlines (generally one to two years afterthe applicable ``cluster'' deadline for state authorization). Once a statehas obtained authorization for the new waste listings, all RCRA waste managementstandards will apply. The phase-in period allowed for state adoption ofFederal program changes is a basic premise of pre-HSWA state authorization.Commenters should also be aware that since state programs are allowed toinclude provisions which go beyond the Federal program, any existing staterequirements would continue to be applicable and enforceable by the stateduring this interim period. Without a mechanism to allow phasing-in of RCRA standards, new Federalprogram requirements_particularly new waste listings or identifications_couldresult in unworkable situations. Generators in unauthorized states maynot be able to find a facility that is eligible to take their newly listedor identified wastes. This could occur if there are no facilities withinthe state that qualified for interim status or received a permit modificationfor the new waste. Alternatively, if the generator has an existing arrangementto send its waste to a facility in an authorized state, the receiving facilitywould have no opportunity to gain interim status until its state adoptsthe waste stream as hazardous. EPA believes that the phase-in of the RCRAprogram that has been established for state assumption of the new Federalrequirements is essential for a workable national hazardous waste managementsystem. The Agency solicits comments on this proposed clarification of the definitionof ``designated facility.'' In particular, EPA would like to know if generatorsand waste management facilities have encountered problems with their wasteshipments to authorized states as discussed above. The Agency also solicits comments on alternative approaches to this problem.One option would be to require the receiving facility to be permitted,licensed, registered, or otherwise subject to a prior approval programby a state to manage municipal or industrial solid waste. This would besimilar to the existing requirement for small quantity generator wastein andSection; 261.5(g)(3). However, this option may present some of thesame drawbacks as the existing ``designated facility'' definition in thatit might not be clear what constitutes an adequate state prior approvalscheme. This proposed clarification will not alter the requirement that a generatoroffer his waste only to transporters who have EPA identification numbers.(See 40 CFR 262.12(c)). Thus, if a newly listed waste is transferred betweentransporters in a state where the waste is not yet hazardous, both transportersshould be identified on the manifest. The initial transporter would stillbe required to keep the copy of the manifest on file. In order to ensure that the waste reaches the designated facility, EPAis proposing to require that the generator arrange that the designatedfacility owner or operator sign and return the manifest to the generator,and that out-of-state transporters sign and foward the manifest to thedesignated facility. The return of the manifest to the generator will ``closethe loop'' on the disposition of the generated waste and allow the generatorto attempt to resolve any discrepancies in the manifest, as required by40 CFR 262.42. This new requirement parallels the requirements in 40 CFR264.71 and 265.71. However, as opposed to those sections, which requirethe receiving facility to return the manifest, the proposed andSection; 262.23(e)puts the burden on the generator to ensure the return of the manifest whenthe waste is sent to a facility in a state not yet authorized to treatthe waste as hazardous. EPA believes that this approach is appropriate,since the facility receiving the waste and any out-of-state transportersmay not be subject to subtitle C regulation, if they do not otherwise handleany RCRA hazardous wastes. It should be noted that with this approach thedesignated facility and out-of-state transporters would not be requiredto obtain EPA identification numbers since the waste is not hazardous intheir state. (Of course, once the state becomes authorized to treat theparticular waste as hazardous, the facility would need a RCRA subtitleC permit (or interim status) to continue managing the waste and all transporterswould need EPA identification numbers.) The Agency intends to review the comments on today's proposed changes tothe ``designated facility'' definition, and will promulgate a final rulewith the associated mining waste final rule. EPA believes that it is importantto clarify the existing regulation so that the parties affected by non-HSWAwaste identifications and listings know the status of these wastes andthe management standards that apply to them if they cross state borders.A minor technical correction is also included in the proposed languageof ``designated facility'' to clarify that an interim status facility inan authorized state may be a designated facility. EPA believes that itis universally understood that these interim status facilities can accepthazardous waste shipments, and this was the original intent of the provision.Therefore, in the first sentence of the proposal a parenthetical clauseis added with the words ``or interim status''.C. Compliance Dates<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Interim Status and Permit Modifications in Unauthorized States</ITAG>Facilities that currently treat, store, or dispose of wastes that havebeen removed from temporary Bevill exclusion and are characteristicallyhazardous under 40 CFR part 261, subpart C, but have not received a permitpursuant to section 3005 of RCRA and are not operating pursuant to interimstatus, may be eligible for interim status (see section 3005(e)(1)(A)(ii)of RCRA, as amended). In order to operate pursuant to interim status, suchfacilities must submit a Section 3010 notice pursuant to 40 CFR 270.70(a)within 90 days of publication of the final rule, and must submit a PartA permit application within six months of publication of the final rule.Under section 3005(e)(3), land disposal facilities qualifying for interimstatus under section 3005(e)(1)(A)(ii) must also submit a Part B applicationand certify that the facility is in compliance with all applicable groundwater monitoring and financial responsibility requirements within 18 monthsof publication of the final rule. If the facility fails to do so, interimstatus will terminate on that date.Completion of final permit application will require individual facilitiesto develop and compile information on their on-site waste management operationsincluding, but not limited to the following activities: ground-water monitoring(if waste management on land is involved); manifest systems, recordkeeping,and reporting; closure, and possibly, post-closure requirements; and financialresponsibility requirements. The permit applications may also require developmentof engineering plans to upgrade existing facilities. In addition, manyof these facilities will, in the future, be subject to land disposal restrictions(LDR) standards. As explained on September 1, EPA considers wastes whichwould be brought under subtitle C regulation by today's proposal to be``newly identified'' wastes for purposes of establishing LDR standardsunder section 3004(g)(4) of RCRA. (54 FR 36624). Under EPA regulations,LDR standards must require treatment of the affected wastes to a levelor by a method that reflects the use of Best Demonstrated Available Technology(BDAT) before the wastes can be disposed on the land. Thus, one futureimplication of today's proposed rule (and the eventual final rule) willbe the ban on land disposal of these wastes unless they are appropriatelytreated prior to such disposal. EPA will further address LDR standardsfor non-Bevill mineral processing wastes within the context of the upcoming``Third Third'' proposal.All existing hazardous waste management facilities (as defined in 40 CFR270.2) that treat, store, or dispose of hazardous wastes covered by today'sproposed rule, and that are currently operating pursuant to interim statusunder section 3005(e) of RCRA, must file with EPA an amended part A permitapplication within six months of the publication of the final rule, inaccordance with andSection; 270.72(a).Under current regulations, a hazardous waste management facility that hasreceived a permit pursuant to Section 3005 may not treat, store, or disposeof the wastes removed from temporary exclusion by today's proposed ruleand which are characteristically hazardous under 40 CFR part 261, subpartC when the final rule becomes effective until a permit modification allowingsuch activity has occurred in accordance with andSection; 270.42. Consequently,owners and operators of such facilities will want to file any necessaryapplications with EPA well before the effective date of the final rule.EPA has recently amended its permit modification procedures for newly listedor identified wastes. (See 40 CFR 270.42(g).) For more details on the permitmodification procedures, see 53 FR 37912, September 28, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Interim Status and Permit Modifications in Authorized States </ITAG>Until the state is authorized to regulate the wastes excluded from temporaryexclusion by today's proposed rule and which are hazardous under 40 CFRpart 261, part C, no permit requirments apply and facilities lacking apermit need not seek interim status. Any facility treating, storing, ordisposing of these wastes on the effective date of authorization of thestate to regulate these wastes under RCRA may qualify for interim statusunder applicable state law. Note that in order to be no less stringentthan the Federal program, the state ``in existence'' date for determininginterim status eligibility may not be later than the effective date ofEPA's authorization of the state to regulate these wastes. These facilitiesmust provide the required 3010 notification within 90 days of publicationof the final Federal rule as described above and must also provide thestate's equivalent of a part A permit application as required by authorizedstate law. Finally, RCRA section 3005(e) (interim status) or any authorized stateanalog will apply to waste management facilities qualifying for state interimstatus. For those facilities managing wastes under an existing state RCRApermit, state permit modification procedures will apply. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Effect on State Authorizations </ITAG>This proposed rule will not be effective in RCRA authorized states untilthe state program amendments are effective, because its requirements arenot being imposed pursuant to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendmentsof 1984. Thus, this removal from temporary exclusion will be applicablesix months after publication of the final rule only in those few statesthat do <T3>not</T3> have final authorization to operate their own hazardous wasteprograms in lieu of the Federal program. In authorized states, the reinterpretationof the regulation of non-excluded processing wastes will not be applicableuntil the state revises its program to adopt equivalent requirements understate law and receives authorization for these new requirements. (Of course,the requirements will be applicable as state law if the state law is effectiveprior to authorization). Assuming that EPA makes final the scope of the Bevill exclusion by January15, 1990, as planned, states that have final authorization would be required(40 CFR 271.21(e)) to revise their programs to adopt equivalent standardsregulating non-Bevill mineral processing wastes that exhibit hazardouscharacteristics as hazardous by July 1, 1991 if only regulatory changesare necessary, or by July 1, 1992 if statutory changes are necessary. Thesedeadlines can be extended by up to six months (i.e., until January 1, 1992and January 1, 1993, respectively) in exceptional cases (40 CFR 271.21(e)(3)).Once EPA approves the revision, the state requirements become RCRA SubtitleC requirements in that state. States are not authorized to regulate anywastes subject to today's proposal until EPA approves their regulations.Of course, states with existing standards that address these wastes maycontinue to administer and enforce their regulations as a matter of statelaw. Currently unauthorized states that submit an official application for finalauthorization less than 12 months after the effective date of the finalrule may be approved without including an equivalent provision (i.e., toaddress non-Bevill mineral processing wastes) in the application. However,once authorized, a state must revise its program to include an equivalentprovision according to the requirements and deadlines provided at 40 CFR271.21(e).<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Economic Impact Screening Analysis Pursuant to Executive Order12291</ITAG>Sections 2 and 3 of Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193) require that aregulatory agency determine whether a new regulation will be ``major''and, if so, that a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) be conducted. A majorrule is defined as a regulation that is likely to result in one or moreof the following impacts: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individuals, industries,Federal, State, and local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.When final, today's proposed rule will complete the Agency's revised interpretationof the Bevill Mining Waste Exclusion for mineral processing wastes, previouslyproposed under Court-ordered deadline on April 17, 1989 (54 FR 15345).The first part of this reinterpretation, dealing with the vast majorityof individual small volume waste streams, was made final on September 1,1989. The preamble to the September rule presented the results of the Agency'seconomic impact screening analysis, covering scores of small volume mineralprocessing wastes, and examining cost impacts associated with 39 potentiallyhazardous small volume wastes in detail. This analysis indicated a totalannual compliance cost for subtitle C waste management of about $54 million.As indicated in Section V of this preamble, today's proposed rule wouldremove seven additional processing wastes from the Bevill exclusion andsubject them to coverage under existing subtitle C regulations if theyexhibit hazardous characteristics. Consistent with Executive Order 12291, the Agency has completed a preliminaryeconomic impact screening analysis for the seven mineral processing wastesproposed for removal from the Bevill exclusion in today's proposed rule.Results of this analysis suggest that five of the seven waste streams arelikely to exhibit hazardous characteristics at some or all of the facilitiesthat generate them, and that nine minerals processing facilities in fivedifferent commodity sectors are likely to incur compliance costs if theBevill status of these wastes is permanently removed. The Agency estimatesthat total annual compliance costs will be on the order of $5 million,and would thus not indicate that today's proposal is a ``major rule'' accordingto the first criterion of E.O. 12291. In addition, for reasons set out below, EPA does not predict a substantialincrease in costs or prices for consumers or a significant effect on internationaltrade or employment in connection with today's proposal. One or two individualmineral processing facilities may experience moderate compliance costswhich could affect their ability to compete in their respective commoditysectors. On balance, the Agency does not believe that today's proposedrule constitutes a major rule as defined by E.O. 12291. The following paragraphs of this section present the Agency's economicimpact screening approach, assumptions, and results in more detail. A. Approach The Agency's screening analysis was based on a modification of the procedureused to develop the cost and economic impacts of the September 1, 1989final rule, details of which are provided in the technical background documentfor that rule.\3\<NOTE/> The major differences between the two analyses are that inthis instance, EPA conducted facility-specific, rather than sector-wideanalyses, and used newly available waste characteristics, generation, andmanagement data collected through the Agency's recent sampling effort andindustry survey. These new data allowed EPA to characterize waste streamsand current and prospective management trains much more accurately forthe seven wastes studied for today's proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ USEPA. Technical Background Document: Development of theCost, Economic, and Small Business Impacts Arising from the Reinterpretationof the Bevill Exclusion for Mineral Processing Wastes. August 18, 1989.Because many of these site-specific data have been designated ConfidentialBusiness Information (CBI) by company respondents, EPA has not providedinformation in this preamble or in the supporting technical backgrounddocument \4\<NOTE/> on facility-specific waste generation rates or managementpractice assumptions, in order to prevent unauthorized release of company-specificinformation. For presentation purposes, however, the Agency has developedproxies for some of the confidential information (e.g., commodity productionrates) from published sources,\5\<NOTE/> and has used and reported this information in the analysispresented below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ USEPA. Technical Background Document: Development of theCost and Economic Impacts of Implementing the Bevill Mineral ProcessingWastes Criteria. September 15, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 1988 Directory of Chemical Producers (SRI International),Chemical Marketing Reporter.Waste characteristics for the seven wastes were ascribed based on EPA wastesampling data. In contrast to the criteria and test procedures used todetermine whether the wastes are ``low hazard'' for purposes of today'sproposal, the approach used here employed EP toxicity test results andstandard hazardous waste characteristic tests (e.g., corrosivity limitsof pH between 2.0 and 12.5), because these are the tests and regulatorylevels that will be used to determine whether wastes will be regulatedunder Subtitle C after removal from the Bevill exclusion. Although wasteswere not sampled at every facility generating each waste type, EPA usedthe conservation assumption that if a waste type exhibited one or morehazardous characteristics at one sample facility, then it would exhibitthe same characteristics (i.e., pass or fail) at all facilities generatingthe same waste, <T3>unless </T3>there was specific sampling evidence to the contrary. Therefore,EPA may have overestimated costs and impacts for some facilities and sectorsfor which sampling was not comprehensive for all facilities.Of the seven waste streams reviewed, the preliminary screening assessmentsuggests that two_process wastewater from coal gasification and sulfateprocess waste solids from titanium dioxide production_are not likely totest hazardous under current characteristic test procedures. Accordingly,EPA has assumed in the economic screening analysis that the facilitiesgenerating these two wastes will experience no compliance cost impactsassociated with potential subtitle C regulation of these wastes. The remainingfive waste streams were considered hazardous at all facilities, for thecharacteristics specified, as follows:andbullet; Chromite roast/leach ore residue_EP toxic for chromium.andbullet; Element phosphorus off-gas solids (from wet collection)_EP toxicfor cadmium.andbullet; Hydrofluoric acid process wastewater_Corrosive.andbullet; Primary lead process wastewater_EP toxic for arsenic, cadmium,and lead, corrosive.andbullet; Titanium dioxide sulfate process waste acids_EP toxic for chromium,corrosive.These commodity sectors and wastes were then further analyzed in termsof current (baseline) management practices.As in the previous screening analysis for the September rule, the Agencydeveloped baseline and subtitle C treatment scenarios for the wastes tobe withdrawn from the Bevill exclusion and estimated the incremental costsincurred by each sector in treating the wastes as hazardous under RCRA.In contrast to the previous analysis, however, EPA simulated costs forbaseline management practices on a site-specific basis using the actualdata provided for each of the 13 potentially affected facilities in thefive sectors studied. Subtitle C management practices were developed asbefore, using knowledge of subtitle C requirements and best engineeringjudgment.EPA determined that five of the 13 facilities analyzed on the basis ofcompany-provided data are currently managing hazardous wastes in compliancewith current subtitle C requirements, and thus might not incur additionalcosts if this rule is promulgated in its present form. For example, ifan affected facility already has one or more appropriate waste managementunits with approved subtitle C permits and sufficient capacity to managea newly non-Bevill characteristic waste, then the regulatory compliancecosts associated with removing the waste from the Bevill exclusion wouldbe a small fraction of what they would be otherwise, and would consistprimarily of incremental operating and maintenance (as opposed to capitalconstruction and closure) costs. The data used to establish these baselinewaste management assumptions were obtained from responses to EPA's 1987-88National Survey of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, Disposal, and RecyclingFacilities (TSDR Survey). The methods used to organize and manipulate thesedata are described in a technical background document to the September1 final rule.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ USEPA. 1989. <T3>Development of the High Volume Criterion for Mineral Processing Wastes.</T3>Special Wastes Branch, Office of Solid Waste. August 18, 1989.Other information sources also indicate that compliance costs associatedwith this rule will be lower than would be predicted using standard wastemanagement assumptions. Data from the National Survey of Solid Wastes fromMineral Processing Facilities indicate that current practice for managingmany of the wastes (particularly the wastewaters) proposed for removalin today's NPRM includes treatment in a wastewater treatment plant, directdischarge via NPDES permit provisions, and/or recycling to the processgenerating the waste in question. EPA has reviewed this information, andused it to develop baseline and subtitle C compliance scenarios for thisanalysis. As a result, estimated compliance costs at several of the facilitiesaffected by today's proposal are zero, i.e., removal of the waste fromBevill will impose no operational or economic impacts.B. Aggregate and Sector Compliance CostsThe impact screening analysis projects that nine facilities in five differentmineral processing commodity sectors will be affected directly by today'sproposed rule. Another four facilities, one each in the chromite and titaniumdioxide sectors, and two in the lead sector, are believed to be unaffectedby virtue of already incorporating Subtitle C (or equivalent NPDES wastewatertreatment) practices in their current waste management systems. In aggregate,the total impact of today's rule is estimated to be about $5.2 millionper year.EPA cost estimates for individual facilities are presented by sector inTable 4. Two sectors, titanium dioxide and chromite, are expected to experienceaggregate sector impacts in excess of $1 million annually. Within eachof these two sectors, all of the cost impacts are predicted to fall onone of the two facilities, with the other producer's waste management costsbeing unaffected by removal from the Bevill exclusion. The hydrofluoricacid manufacturers (Allied Signal and Pennwalt) would experience cost increasesof about $500,000 and $200,000, respectively. The primary lead producers,Asarco and Doe Run, would experience compliance cost impacts of $41,000and $235,000, respectively. Estimated cost impacts for individual primarylead facilities range from zero to $201,000 annually, depending on currentmanagement practices and plant-specific waste characteristics. The two(of five) elemental phosphorus plants that are expected to experience impactshave total estimated incremental costs of $179,000 annually, with the vastmajority ($173,000) imposed on the facility owned by Occidental ChemicalCorporation.At four facilities, estimated compliance costs are zero, i.e., removalof the facility's candidate special waste from the Bevill exclusion willimpose no cost or economic impacts. This is primarily due to the currentmanagement practices being employed at these four facilities. The unaffectedTiO<T2>2</T2> facility (Kemira) is a fully permitted RCRA subtitle C managementfacility; examination of data from EPA's TSDR survey reveals that the permitsand waste management units necessary to handle the newly non-Bevill wasteas a regulated hazardous waste are already in place. At the unaffectedchromite facility (American Chrome and Chemical), EPA survey and samplingdata indicate that the waste goes directly to a wastewater treatment system(exempt from subtitle C), which renders the waste material (both solidsand effluent) non-hazardous. Therefore, the facility can continue to managethe waste under current practice, irrespective of Bevill status. Similarconsiderations indicate that two of Asarco's primary lead facilities (Omahaand Glover) would also be unaffected by today's proposed rule (waste generationand management data have been designated CBI by Asarco).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>4._<T4>Summary of Production, Value of Shipments, and Compliance Costs</T4><H1>Commodity sector</H1><H1>Number of plants producing commodity</H1><H1>Production \1\ (mt/yr) </H1><H1>Unit value ($/mt)</H1><H1>Value of shipments ($yr)</H1><H1>Compliance costs ($yr)</H1><ITAG tagnum="21">Chromite (2) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Entire Sector<D>2</D><D>150,000</D><D>1,416</D><D>212,401,306</D><D>2,274,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Facilities Evaluated<D>1</D><D>150,000</D><D>1,416</D><D>212,401,306</D><D>2,274,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">American Chrome_Corpus Christi TX</ITAG><D/><D>41,000</D><D>1,416</D><D>58,056,357</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Occidental_Castle Hayne NC</ITAG><D/><D>109,000</D><D>1,416</D><D>154,344,949</D><D>2,274,000</D><ITAG tagnum="21">Elemental phosphorus</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Entire Sector<D>5</D><D>341,950</D><D>1,688</D><D>577,266,155</D><D>179,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Facilities Evaluated<D>2</D><D>174,150</D><D>1,688</D><D>293,992,312</D><D>179,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">FMC_Pocatello ID</ITAG><D/><D>122,449</D><D>1,688</D><D>206,713,335</D><D>6,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Occidental_Columbia TN</ITAG><D/><D>51,701</D><D>1,688</D><D>87,278,968</D><D>173,000</D><ITAG tagnum="21">Hydrofluoric Acid</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Entire Sector<D>3</D><D>235,374</D><D>1,273</D><D>299,642,952</D><D>678,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Facilities Evaluated (3)<D>2</D><D>110,204</D><D>1,273</D><D>140,295,255</D><D>678,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Allied_Geismar LA</ITAG><D/><D>86,168</D><D>1,273</D><D>109,695,878</D><D>490,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Pennwalt-Calvert City KY</ITAG><D/><D>24,036</D><D>1,273</D><D>30,599,377</D><D>188,000</D><ITAG tagnum="21">Lead</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Entire Sector<D>5</D><D>374,633</D><D>724</D><D>271,162,781</D><D>276,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Facilities Evaluated<D>3</D><D>374,633</D><D>724</D><D>271,162,781</D><D>276,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Asarco_East Helena MT (4)</ITAG><D/><D>52,189</D><D>724</D><D>37,775,036</D><D>41,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Asarco_Glover MO (4) </ITAG><D/><D>52,189</D><D>724</D><D>37,775,036</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Asarco_Omaha NE (4) </ITAG><D/><D>52,189</D><D>724</D><D>37,775,036</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Doe Run_Buick MO</ITAG><D/><D>92,762</D><D>724</D><D>67,141,706</D><D>34,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Doe Run_Herculaneum MO </ITAG><D/><D>125,304</D><D>724</D><D>90,695,969</D><D>201,000</D><ITAG tagnum="21">Titanium dioxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Entire Sector<D>9</D><D>893,878</D><D>1,891</D><D>1,690,482,634</D><D>1,817,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Facilities Evaluated<D>1</D><D>114,286</D><D>1,891</D><D>216,134,766</D><D>1,817,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Kemira Oy_Savannah GA (5)</ITAG><D/><D>54,422</D><D>1,891</D><D>102,921,317</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">SCM_Baltimore MD (5) </ITAG><D/><D>59,864</D><D>1,891</D><D>113,213,449</D><D>1,817,000</D><ITAG tagnum="21">Combined total_all five sectors</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Entire Sector<D>24</D><D>1,995,834</D><D>1,529</D><D>3,050,955,829</D><D>5,224,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Facilities Evaluated<D>9</D><D>923,272</D><D>1,228</D><D>1,133,986,421</D><D>5,224,000</D><F>1. 100 percent capacity utilization is assumed.</F><F>2.

Economic ImpactsEPA's screening-level analysis of economic impact compared the magnitudeof compliance costs for each affected facility to the estimated value ofshipments. This ratio provides a first approximation of the extent to whichthe profitability of firms, or, alternatively, commodity prices, or othermeasures of national impact may be adversely affected by the impositionof regulatory compliance costs.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Impacts on Commodity Sectors</ITAG>Economic impacts, expressed as the ratio of annual compliance costs toannual value of shipments, are displayed in Table 5. Sectors or facilitieswith ratios above one percent were considered vulnerable to moderate tosignificant financial impacts and were evaluated in more detail in termsof market and industry factors that might affect the ultimate incidenceand impact of the costs.As seen in Table 5, only two facilities (one each in the titanium dioxide(sulfate) and sodium chromate/bichromate sectors) are predicted to experienceimpacts above the one percent level, both at around 1.5 percent. This levelof impact is regarded as moderate. The two elemental phosphorus (FMC andOccidental), primary lead (Asarco and Doe Run), and hydrofluoric acid producers(Allied-Signal and Pennwalt) examined in this study are expected to experienceonly minor economic impacts. Obviously, firms and facilities already incompliance and with compliance costs of zero (i.e., Kemira, American Chromeand Chemical, and Asarco) will not experience any economic impacts associatedwith this rule. To further explore the economic impact of today's proposal, EPA has examinedsome of the factors that affect the ability of affected firms to pass throughprospective compliance costs to product consumers in the form of higherprices. These factors include absolute price levels, major end users ofthe mineral commodity, competition from imports and substitutes, secondaryproduction, and flexibility in other production cost factors. These arediscussed for each of the two affected sectors in the paragraphs below.<T3>a. Titanium dioxide. </T3>Titanium dioxide is used in pigments forpaints and surface coatings, paper manufacturing, and plastics. Half oftitanium dioxide production is consumed in pigments, where its competitiveposition is strong. Demand for high-quality paper also favors titaniumdioxide. The domestic industry supplies most of the titanium dioxide used in theU.S., with imports exceeding exports by only a moderate degree. As a result,titanium dioxide is in a relatively strong market position. Producers usingthe sulfate process, however, are in a minority and account for only oneeighth of domestic production. It is not likely that the one affected producercould establish a premium for its product and would therefore be limitedin the extent to which it could recover cost increases.<T3>b. Sodium chromate and bichromate. </T3>Sodium chromate and bichromateare used in a number of applications, including chrome pigments for paints.Derivative chrome pigments have excellent performance characteristics andhave experienced gains in certain applications, such as traffic paintsand automotive coatings. The U.S. is a net exporter of sodium chromateand bichromate. Given the low level of import competition and the small number of producersin the domestic industry, the one affected producer is apt to have a reasonablygood prospect of recovering production cost increases.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>5_<T4>Compliance Costs at Potentially Affected Facilities</T4><H1>Commodity sector</H1><H1>Plant</H1><H1>Compliance costs ($)</H1><H1>Costs per metric ton of product ($/MT)</H1><H1>Costs/value of shipments (%)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromite<D>Amer.

Effects on Consumer Prices</ITAG>For several reasons, EPA believes that this rule will not create any appreciablechanges in consumer prices. The first and principal reason is the low overallpercentage effect of compliance costs relative to product value, whichdoes not exceed 1.5 percent for any affected commodity. Combined with thisis the fact that not all producers in these sectors are affected equally(many domestic competitors are not affected at all) and that other domesticor foreign competitors could fill production shortfalls, either with identicalor substitutable products. Finally, since all the affected commoditiesare primary intermediate inputs to the production of other finished products,their contribution to final consumer goods prices is, in any case, typicallyquite small.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Foreign Trade Impacts</ITAG>Trade is substantial in the mineral commodities addressed in this study.Basic import and export data for the sectors that generate potentiallyhazardous wastes are presented in Table 6. Export markets are significantfor the commodities that EPA has identified as having moderate compliancecost impacts (i.e., cost/value of shipments of one percent or more), andthese markets may be adversely affected by the predicted economic impactsof compliance. Because imports of titanium dioxide are signficant, theability of the affected domestic producer to raise prices to recover compliancecosts is, as discussed above, somewhat limited.Using the import and export figures in Table 6 as one indicator of potentialimpacts, the international trade situation facing the firms in the commoditysectors that will experience cost impacts above the one percent level canbe summarized as follows:andbullet; The one affected titanium dioxide producer will have difficultyin passing through compliance costsandbullet; The sodium chromate and bichromate producer should not have difficultyin passing through compliance costsIn view of the above, it is unlikely that the overall trade balance inthe domestic minerals industry will be significantly affected by today'srule, though in one sector regulatory cost impacts may increase alreadypositive net imports to a small degree.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>6._<T4>Imports and Exports of Minerals, </T4>1987 <H1>Commodity sector </H1><H1>Commodity form(s) </H1><H1>Domestic production </H1><H2>Quantity (mt)</H2><H2>Value ($000)</H2><H1>Imports </H1><H2>Quantity (mt)</H2><H2>Value ($000)</H2><H1>Exports </H1><H2>Quantity (mt) </H2><H2>Value ($000)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromite (1) <D> </D><D>150,000 </D><D>212,401 </D><D>4,754 </D><D>3,173 </D><D>15,017 </D><D>181,107 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Elemental Phosphorus <D> </D><D>341,950 </D><D>577,266 </D><D>4,463 </D><D>6,609 </D><D>20,302 </D><D>30,796 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>Pigs and bars (content) (2) </D><D>374,633 </D><D>271,163 </D><D>185,673 </D><D>123,157 </D><D>10,116 </D><D>11,945 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hydrofluoric Acid <D> </D><D>235,374 </D><D>299,643 </D><D>103,127 </D><D>95,211 </D><D>n/a </D><D>n/a</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Titanium Dioxide <D>Titanium Dioxide Pigments (content) </D><D>893,878 </D><D>1,690,483 </D><D>162,739 </D><D>236,945 </D><D>99,731 </D><D>181,707 </D><F>Source: Bureau of Mines, Minerals Yearbook 1987. pp. 61, 64, 221, 223,377, 684, 889, 893, and 894.</F><F>1.

Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354), which amendsthe Administrative Procedures Act, requires Federal regulatory agenciesto consider ``small entities'' throughout the regulatory process. The RFArequires, in Section 603, an initial screening analysis to be peformedto determine whether a substantial number of small entities will be significantlyaffected by a regulation. If so, regulatory alternatives that eliminateor mitigate the impacts must be considered.In the preamble to the September final rule, the Agency presented a descriptionof and the results from a comprehensive screening analysis to determinethe potential for significant small business impacts imposed by the reinterpretationof the Mining Waste Exclusion. The analysis conducted for today's proposalwas conducted using identical procedures. These are outlined very brieflybelow and are described more fully in the technical background documentto the September final rule.The Agency has concluded that today's proposed rule will not have a significantadverse impact on a substantial number of small mineral processing companies,because there are no small businesses in the sectors that are expectedto experience impacts from today's proposed rule.A. Definition of Affected Small EntitiesToday's proposal would impose impacts only on the facilities in the fivecommodity sectors that generate wastes that would be removed from the Bevillexclusion and that could fail any of the Agency's tests for hazardous wastecharacteristics. Based upon the information contained in the responsesto the industry survey and EPA waste sampling results, the five mineralcommodity sectors and nine facilities most likely to face subtitle C compliancecosts have been identified in section VIII of this preamble.For purposes of defining ``small business'' firms, EPA has again reliedon the standard definitions of the Small Business Administration (SBA)as published at 13 CFR ch. 1, part 121. For the industries in question,SBA employs a basic employment-based definition, with the small businesscut-off value for total company employment ranging between 500 and 1,000employees, depending upon the specific industry in question.For the affected mineral processing facilities identified above in sectionVIII, EPA conducted a comprehensive RFA business ownership screening analysisfor those mineral commodity sectors estimated to incur economic impactsassociated with today's proposed rule. All potentially affected plantsand businesses were examined individually.Facility location and ownership information was obtained as in the previousanalysis in support of the September 1 final rule (see 54 FR 36592). Dataon the employment size of affected firms were obtained from published sources(e.g., Standard andamp; Poors, Dun andamp; Bradstreet). The Agency then comparedreported company employment to the Small Business Administration's (SBA's)definition of a small business for each sector's SIC code to determinethe number of small businesses, if any, in that sector. SBA defines smallbusinesses as less than 1000 employees or less than 750 employees for mostof the SIC codes.B. ResultsAs shown in table 7, EPA believes that all of the firms that might be affectedby today's proposal are large businesses, according to the SBA's companysize criterion. Accordingly, the Agency concludes that there will not bea significant (or, in fact, any) adverse impact on a substantial numberof small mineral processing companies as a result of this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>7._<T4>Employment Estimates for Potentially Affected Mineral Processing Business</T4><H1>Commodity sector </H1><H1>Facility name </H1><H1>Facility location </H1><H1>Owner name </H1><H1>Owner location </H1><H1>No. of employees </H1><H1>Source of info.</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromite <D>Am.
