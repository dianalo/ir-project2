Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., voicing theconcern of many lawmakers that the issue remains potent despiteevidence the uproar that greeted the June 21 ruling has subsided.   Even though House and Senate leaders expect legislation to pass,many lawmakers who spent August at home on recess say they heardlittle about the issue from constituents.   ``My constituents couldn't care less about a superficial issuelike flag-burning,'' said Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y.   Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill., said the matter was ``an abstraction tomost people. I doubt you can find one person in a million who haswitnessed someone desecrating the flag.''   But many Americans, particularly veterans' groups, are stillangry. ``People are incensed,'' said Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo.``They still want to see action quickly.''   In its 5-4 ruling, the court overturned a Texas law under which aprotester was charged for burning a flag at the 1984 RepublicanNational Convention in Dallas.   With legislation to protect the flag ready to begin movingthrough Congress this week, the only question appeared to be whetherCongress would submit a constitutional amendment to the states forratification in addition to widely expected passage of a law.   An amendment would have to be approved by a two-thirds majorityof the House and Senate and by 34 of the 50 states, while a lawrequires simple majority votes of the House and Senate and thepresident's signature.   The proposed law, on which House debate begins Tuesday, wouldimpose unspecified fines and up to a year in prison for anyone who``knowingly mutilates, defaces, burns or tramples upon any flag ofthe United States.''   Democratic leaders say enactment of a law could defuse apotential political bombshell without eroding First Amendmentrights, although civil libertarians and the American Bar Associationsay the proposed law is still too restrictive.   But President Bush and other Republican leaders, backed byveterans' groups including the American Legion, say they doubt thelegislation would survive a court challenge. They are pushing aconstitutional amendment.   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has scheduled a Senatevote on the amendment for Oct. 16. In the House, Republicans andDemocrats were exploring a tradeoff in which the leadership wouldallow a vote on the constitutional amendment and the GOP minoritywould drop plans to oppose the statute.   While Republicans appeared to view the issue as a political plus,many Democrats voiced discomfort at the prospect of having negativevotes on the statute or the amendment used against them in futurecampaigns.   ``My sense is that people are concerned that Republicans will usethe issue in the same unprincipled but politically effective way inwhich they used the Pledge'' of Allegiance against Democraticpresidential nominee Michael Dukakis last year, said Rep. Ted Weiss,D-N.Y.   Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich., chairman of the House GOP campaigncommittee, said Democrats have good reason to worry. ``I'd like tosee a lot of Democrats voting against (the amendment) because I dothink it would make them vulnerable,'' he said.   Democrats who vote for the statute but against the constitutionalamendment would not be immune from attacks, Vander Jagt said,adding, ``They would have voted against the only viable solution,the only real way to protect the flag.''   But some Democrats say they believe most voters would besatisfied with a statute.   ``I think the momentum to build up to a constitutional amendmenthas diminished substantially,'' said Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla. ``Astatute will suffice. Even veterans' groups ... are telling me rightnow they think a statute's sufficient.''</TEXT></DOC>
