The acquisition will substantially boost Ultramar's British resources at a time when its own output is declining. In addition, Blackfriars mostly produces natural gas, balancing Ultramar's exclusively oil-based output.    Associated Newspapers said it will receive #110.2 million for its 99% stake in Blackfriars. The proceeds will be used to reduce debt and fund development of its core businesses.    Ultramar, which also will assume #31.4 million of Blackfriars' debt, said it will finance the acquisition through existing cash reserves and loan facilities. The purchase will increase Ultramar's debt-to-equity ratio to 76%, from 58% as of June 30, an Ultramar spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
