<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-76-0268 </DOCNO><TEXT>The in-reactor tube of the In-Pile Creep Facility had been irradiatedperiodically for over 6 years in the Japan Materials Testing Reactor(JMTR) up to the end of 1978 under an operating condition of high temperatureand high pressure identical to that of the Prototype Advanced ThermalReactor, FUGEN, to gain the basic data for estimating the amount of creepwhich would occur in the pressure tubes of FUGEN. Following the removalof the in-reactor tube out of the JMTR, the test sections in the tubewhich were to be subjected to post irradiation examination were cut out.Underwater plasma arc cutting was employed to prevent the spread of contaminationto the work area, to confine the heat affected zone in the test piecesto a minimum and to simplify disposal of the unneeded portions of thepressure tube. Setup of the cutting machine, cutting operations, radiologicalconditions during cutting of the highly radioactive portion of the tubeand disassembly of the cutting equipment are described. In addition abrief description of the underwater plasma arc cutting machine is presented.The hot-cutting operations were done remotely to control personal exposure.The containment envelope prevented the spread of contamination to theenvironment and radioactive particles deposited on the cutting machinewere removed without any difficulties. External exposure received bycutting personnel was small. Internal radionuclide deposit examinationswere conducted, determining no crew member inhaled radioactive substances.Contamination spreads to the work area were minimal and release of radionuclidewas well controlled.</TEXT></DOC>
