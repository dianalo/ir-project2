The government signed an accord with the mutinous inmates thatcalls for replacing Pavon prison's authorities and entire guardcorps and ``to guarantee the absolute physical integrity'' of therebels.   ``There were neither victors or vanquished,'' said prisonspokesman Conrado Monroy of the rebellion's conclusion. ``Theobject was to avoid more deaths, and that was done.''   He said a new director and warden had been named and that theguards would be replaced ``within days.''   At least four guards and three inmates were killed in theuprising at the country's largest prison, 15 miles east ofGuatemala City. The rebels had demanded guaranteed pardons forcrimes committed during the revolt, but the government said onlyCongress can pardon crimes.   Interior Minister Roberto Valle Valdizan, the government'sspecial attorney general for human rights, and threerepresentatives of an estimated 100 rebel inmates signed the accorda day after authorities cut off food, water and electricity to thecrowded prison.   Firefighters and Red Cross workers evacuated friends andrelatives of inmates caught inside the prison by the revolt, whichauthorities said began on Easter Sunday as a mass escape.   Prison authorities began a roll call of the inmates and aninventory to account for weapons.   Monroy said the rebels handed over 61 carbines they seizedSunday.   Judge Daniel Marroquin of neighboring San Jose Pinula saidseveral rifles appeared to be missing but that some may have beendestroyed.   He said the official death toll remained at seven. Other bodieswere reportedly on the grounds, but he said he had not had theopportunity to make a thorough search.   About 600 people, mostly women and children, were visiting theprison when the uprising began and most remained inside with theinmates. Authorities differed on whether they were hostages orwhether they stayed to protect loved ones from security forcereprisals.   By midafternoon Thursday, about a third of the family membershad been taken from the prison grounds, and officials said the restwould be removed during the night.   About 110 prisoners who did not participate in the rebellionfled the prison Wednesday and were taken into custody. Twentyrelatives of inmates also made their way out over the past few days.   The rebelling inmates reportedly held key sections of the2.5-square-mile institution.   Though Guatemala is in the tropics, its elevation makes forbitingly chilly nights with temperatures in the low 50s. Manyinside the prison had to shiver through nights huddled in scarceblankets or curled up on cold concrete floors.   The rebels have been described as hardened criminals servinglong sentences for crimes such as murder and kidnapping. Theyreportedly include former security force members.   More than 1,000 soldiers and police had massed outside theprison gates since the uprising began. They were under orders fromPresident Vinicio Cerezo not to take action unless the prisonerstried to shoot their way out.   Pavon Model Correction Facility, designed to hold 800 prisoners,had about 1,350 inmates when the uprising began.   In the accord, the government also pledged a nationwide prisonreform but not say precisely what would be done. Virtually all ofthe nation's prisons are badly crowded.   The government also promised to relay to ``the pertinentauthorities'' the rebels' request for pardons for crimes committedduring the uprising; guarantee the ``absolute physical integrity''of the rebels after surrender; promote the ``strict application''of a law providing for reduction of prison sentences through work;and present Congress with a proposal for a nationwide reduction ofall prison sentences by five years.   Cerezo said Tuesday that international drug traffickers may havepaid bribes or fees to the uprising's ringleaders to arrange theescape of several convicted traffickers incarcerated at Pavon.   Prison authorities said several Colombians serving drug-relatedsentences were not involved in the uprising. Authorities said theColombians kept out of the takeover drama in a section of theprison they have staked out as their private domain.</TEXT></DOC>
