(wide-word,high-speed, low-power and application-specific DRAMs usedincreasingly in memory system design)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Wilson, Ron.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>DRAM vendors are being driven by competitive pressures, technologyshifts and customer feedback to develop new products with wordwidths from 1 to 18 bits, speeds from 80 to 55 nanoseconds and arange of new features.andP;  Mainframe computer and image-processingvendors are likely to stay with plain DRAMs at low prices; the newDRAMs will likely be used initially in embedded systems, midrangemicrocomputers, palmtops and consumer electronics.andP;  Wide-wordDRAMs will be available from almost all vendors because they meettwo critical needs of system designers: modularity and bandwidth.andO;Wide-word DRAMs have more of a problem with noise, and thenoise-control techniques used by vendors can change the outputcharacteristics of the DRAM in subtle ways, creating newchallenges for system designers.andP;  Applications for wide-word DRAMsand methods used to increase DRAM speed are described.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     DRAMEnhancementsWord LengthNew TechniqueCircuit DesignHardware VendorsPackaging Density.andO;Feature:   illustrationchartphotograph.andO;Caption:   Internal structure of a standard DRAM.
