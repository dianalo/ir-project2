<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-64-0952 </DOCNO><TEXT>A statistically significant association between cigarette smoking andradiologic readings of irregular opacities was observed in a case-controlstudy of 430 South African asbestos miners (OR = 3.03; 95% confidenceinterval, 1.50; 6.11). In another case-control study of 487 dead SouthAfrican asbestos miners, no positive association between smoking andautopsy findings for asbestosis was observed (OR = 0.50; 95% confidenceinterval, 0.20; 1.29). The association between greater than slight asbestosis(moderate and marked) and smoking (yes/no) was not significant (Fisher'sexact test, p = 0.44), and the adjusted odds ratio was 1.25 with 95%confidence interval (0.20; 7.78). In addition, the certification in lifefor asbestosis, based on chest roentgenogram readings for irregular opacities,was also found to have a tendency to be related to smoking. Thus, thefindings of these studies do not support the hypothesis that smokingis associated with the presence of asbestosis at autopsy or that smokingand asbestos dust act synergistically in producing asbestosis at autopsy.But the findings of this and other studies suggest that smoking doesproduce some change in the lung structure that can be visible on theroentgenogram and can be wrongly interpreted as irregular opacities causedby asbestosis.</TEXT></DOC>
