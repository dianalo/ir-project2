 Flatbedscanners can be likened to photocopiers.andP;  They are similar in that the imageto be copied or scanned is placed on a glass plate and covered by a lid, thenpassed over with a light.andP;  As a result, the size of the image can vary.andM;In the case of sheetfed scanners, artwork is fed through a set of rollers andthen scanned.andP;  This method limits the artwork to a specific size.andM;To scan bound, oversized or particularly small artwork, users should seek outa flatbed scanner.andP;  &quot;Our customers generally use these scanners for books toscan a graphic or other detail,&quot; noted Bob Godgart, president of ImageSystems Technology Inc., a scanner-software manufacturer in Troy, N.Y.andM;With a sheetfed scanner, however, &quot;you're limited to one form of use.andP;  Youdon't have the option to feed various mediums through,&quot; explained ChuckJoseph, senior vice president of sales and marketing for Xerox ImagingSystems Inc., in Mountain View, Calif.andP;  &quot;The reason why 99 percent of thescanner market is flatbed is because it gives you the most flexibility forthe money.&quot;andM;Volume is another issue.andP;  Sheetfed scanners are often employed when a largeamount of material must be scanned.andM;Sheetfed scanners are best for bulk text scanning, confirmed Tom Bongiorno,national marketing manager for Sharp Electronics Corp.'s Systems Division, aMahwah, N.J., manufacturer of laptop computers, laser printers and colorperipherals.andM;&quot;I would prefer to use the sheetfeeder, because I can walk away and dosomething else at the same time,&quot; said Courtney Williams, president of DataConversion Services Ltd., a scanning bureau in Fairfax, Va.andP;  Williams usesthe Kurzweil 5100, a scanner from Xerox Imaging Systems, which allows amaximum of 50 pages to be fed at once through the sheetfeeder.andM;A contrary opinion, however, was voiced by May Tsoi, a specialist in scannermarketing for Abaton Technology, a division of PC maker Everex Systems Inc.andO;in Fremont, Calif.andM;Most sheetfed scanners can handle no more than 10 sheets of paper at once,Tsoi said, adding that such a characteristic &quot;isn't much of a benefit.&quot;andM;A third consideration is page format.andM;When the format of a page changes frequently -- for instance, when the numberof columns or the size of the margins differs from page to page -- the bestchoice would probably be a flatbed scanner.andP;  &quot;If the format changes, loadingthe page in a sheetfeeder doesn't really work because you have to change thewindows so often,&quot; said Williams.andM;In the case of a consistent format, however, a sheetfed scanner is mostcommonly used.andP;  &quot;One of the biggest advantages of sheetfed is OCR,&quot; saidSteve Peer, director of marketing for Mirror Technology Inc., a manufacturerof Macintosh peripherals in Roseville, Minn.andM;Optical character recognition (OCR) capability is most important whenscanning large quantities of material, Peer noted.andM;Kelly Wagner, composition-software support coordinator for Waverly Press inBaltimore, is another user of the Kurzweil 5100 scanner.andP;  Wagner explainedthat OCR applications are most helpful in the editorial arena to scan thetext of manuscripts after it is separated from other material such asfigures, tables or mathematical formulas.andM;To meet these various needs, flatbed scanners with optional automaticdocument feeders often may be the most efficient way to go.andM;Since both flatbed and sheetfed scanning are necessary occasionally, thishybrid type of scanner may be most advantageous for the occasional user.andM;&quot;An automatic document feeder adds a lot more versatility, for OCR or imagefiling,&quot; said Jim Milne, director of non-impact products for Fujitsu AmericaInc. in San Jose, Calif.andP;  &quot;A flatbed [scanner] with an optional automaticdocument feeder is your best all-around buy.&quot;andM;&quot;Only 6 to 7 percent [of consumers] will buy the automatic document feederfunction initially,&quot; estimated Xerox's Joseph, adding that &quot;25 to 27 percentwill later purchase&quot; this option.andM;A final issue is accuracy.andP;  With a flatbed scanner, the paper on which theimage is to be copied is perfectly aligned and does not move during thescanning process, so the margin for error is less than with sheetfedscanners.andM;With a sheetfed scanner, paper is fed through rollers, so the paper may endup being incorrectly aligned.andM;&quot;You're limited on how you feed the paper through, [so] sometimes it getsjammed up,&quot; said Gerrit Vandriel, director and co-owner of Bahrich-VandrielAdvertising Inc., a magazine publisher in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.andP;  He usesthe Abaton 300GS, a flatbed scanner.andM;Williams, of Data Conversion Services, reported that the sheetfeed scannershe uses is extremely reliable, although occasionally two pages sticktogether through the feeding process, making it necessary to rescan a page.andM;The flatbed scanner may also be the more accurate of the two.andP;  According toTsoi, the flatbed scanner does a much better job of capturing details.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
