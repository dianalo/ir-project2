Broadway, Yonkers, N.Y.andO;10701 (914) 965-6300.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Lintas:USA, a New York-based advertising agency, chose optical fiber tosupport its heavy use of applications, such as desktop publishing, thatrequire moving large amounts of data quickly.andM;At present, the agency uses less than 5 percent of its Codenet network'scapacity, said Rule Johnson-Morris, vice president and director of officeautomation, but he added that he feels prepared for the future.andM;Lintas chose Codenoll partly because an affiliated company already usedCodenoll hardware, Johnson-Morris said.andM;Codenoll's status as a large, established fiber LAN vendor impressed him aswell, he added.andM;The network was installed last September, and there have been few problems,Johnson-Morris said, adding that support has been good.andP;  ''If there was evera problem, it was rectified immediately.''andM;Installation was simple: ''All we have to do is open up the ceiling and throwthe wire in,'' he said.andM;Westco, a Silver Spring, Md., systems integrator, has installed fiber-basedLANs for several military installations, using hardware from Codenoll andother vendors.andP;  For an installation at the Pentagon last fall, Westco choseCodenet.andP;  A key factor was Codenoll's 19-port star coupler, almost exactlythe right size for that particular installation, said David Baker, Westco'svice president of operations.andM;Codenoll also offered one of the best prices, he said.andM;Cenville Development, an operator of retirement villages in Lake Worth, Fla.,andO;chose optical fiber because lightning storms were causing problems withconventional copper-wire networks.andM;Codenoll was selected largely because it could provide adapters that connectdiskless workstations from Novell Inc. to its network using the networkadapter circuitry already built into the workstations.andP;  That cost less thanduplicating the workstation circuitry with a complete network interface card,said Matthew Bressler, microcomputer division manager for GDC BusinessSystems, which selected and installed the network for Cenville.andM;Optical fiber took ''a little more care'' to install than copper, Bresslersaid.andP;  For the initial installation, Cenville used its own staff oftelephone-cable installers, and some cable was damaged.andP;  Now GDC insists ondoing the installation.andM;Codenoll sent its own people to help with the installation, Bressler said.andO;The network has worked very well since installation, he added.andM;WHISPERNET, FiberCom Inc.andP;  WhisperNet, a fiber implementation of Ethernet,meets or exceeds specifications of Ethernet 1.0 and 2.0 and the IEEE 802.3standard.andM;Last November, FiberCom introduced the WhisperLAN/PC, an interface card thatlinks personal computers to WhisperNet networks.andP;  Mainframes, minicomputersand other Ethernet-compatible devices can also be connected.andM;WhisperNet networks are laid out in a ring topology.andP;  No hubs or starcouplers are required.andP;  Each node is a transceiver and is linked to adjacentnodes in a daisy chain.andP;  The nodes can be as far as 2 kilometers apart, andthe entire network can extend as far as 8 kilometers.andP;  The maximum number ofnodes is 1,024, and the network operates at 10M bps.andM;FiberCom also offers dual-path transceivers that permit implementation of acounter-rotating ring.andP;  This provides a backup fiber onto which traffic isrerouted in the event of a cable break, an advantage in environments wherereliability is critical.andP;  The ring configuration will also simplify futureupgrades to the fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) standard.andM;WhisperNet meets the U.S.andP;  government's Tempest specification forsecurity-sensitive applications.andM;Users of WhisperNet were not available.andM;FiberCom Inc. can be reached at P.O.andP;  Box 11966, Roanoke, Va.andP;  24022-1966(703) 342-6700.andM;PRONET-10, PRONET-80, Proteon Inc.andP;  Proteon's ProNET-10 is a Token-Ringnetwork that can be implemented with optical fiber.andP;  Key components are thep2617 Fiber Center, an eight-node hub; the p1307 IBM PC Fiber Interface; anda series of fiber links.andM;The hardware is compatible with an assortment of LAN software, includingNovell NetWare and Banyan Systems Inc.'s Vines and FTP PC/TCP.andP;  Networks canbe entirely fiber, or a mix of fiber with shielded twisted pair, IBM cablingsystem, infrared or microwave on the same ProNET-10 ring.andM;ProNET-10 can be configured with a single-fiber link, a dual-fiber link or acounter-rotating ring.andP;  It operates at 10M bps over distances of as far as1-1/2 miles.andM;ProNET-80 is a high-speed fiber-optic network operating at 80M bps.andP;  Usingtoken passing, Proteon claims to be able to maintain true 80M-bps throughputeven under heavy loads.andM;ProNET-80 works with multimode and single-mode fiber, and supports networksextending as far as 30 kilometers and comprising as many as 240 nodes.andM;Three types of connection are available: a single-fiber link, aredundant-fiber link and the counter-rotating ring.andP;  ProNET-80'scounter-rotating ring design served as a basis for the FDDI standard.andM;ProNET-80 can use single-mode and multimode optical fiber, as well as IBMType 1 cabling.andP;  ProNET-80 requires two 16-bit boards to attach to a personalcomputer and is more likely to be used as a network backbone.andP;  To create anall-fiber network, users could use the 10M-bit ProNET-10 for local clusters,with ProNET-80 covering the long hauls.andM;Both ProNET-10 and ProNET-80 use ProNET Wire Centers, which connect four,eight or 12 nodes, and can be linked to support as many as 255 nodes pernetwork.andM;Both networks are compatible with Proteon's Router, which allows thesenetworks to be connected to each other, to other Proteon Token-Ring networks,to Ethernet networks and to a variety of wide area networks.andM;ProNET Wire Centers cost from $335 to $1,250, depending on configuration.andO;Each connection to a wire center requires a fiber modem, which costs from$2,300 to $2,900.andP;  The p1307 network interface for PCs costs $1,200.andM;Contact Proteon Inc. at 2 Technology Drive, Westboro, Mass.andP;  01581 (508)898-2800.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;The University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana chose Proteon's ProNet-80 in1986.andP;  The university uses fiber for longer links, depending mainly onEthernet cabling within buildings.andP;  Proteon's open protocol and compatibilitywith Ethernet were key attractions, according to Sue Greenberg, associatedirector of the university's Computer Services Office.andM;The university wanted fiber between buildings partly to avoid electromagneticinterference and the hazard of lightning strikes, and partly just ''to bepositioned for the future,'' Greenberg said.andM;There were a few startup headaches, but installation went well, according toGreenberg.andP;  In regard to reliability, the network has been ''just great,''she  said.andM;LASERLAN PLUS, SimpleNET Systems Inc.andP;  SimpleNET in March began shippingLaserLAN Plus, an FDDI card for IBM PC ATs and compatibles and '386-based PCswith AT  slots.andM;LaserLAN boasts a 100M-bps data rate and does not require a central hub inmost applications.andP;  It provides a single attachment to each workstation.andP;  Anoptional daughtercard, scheduled to be available this spring, will providedual attachments for a full counter-rotating FDDI ring.andM;In a counter-rotating ring, two rings of fiber run in parallel.andP;  In normalcircumstances, all traffic travels on one fiber, in one direction.andP;  If onesegment of fiber is broken, however, traffic on that segment is automaticallyrouted back along the second fiber to complete the ring.andP;  If there is morethan one cable break, the network can partition itself into two rings.andM;LaserLAN uses a full-sized card that plugs into any 16-bit AT slot.andP;  LaserLANuses 62.5/125-micron multimode fiber-optic cable and standard ST-typeconnectors.andP;  It supports a maximum of 1,500 meters of cable between nodes andas much as 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) for the entire ring.andM;The LaserLAN Plus PC interface card costs $4,995 with plastic optical datalinks or $5,495 with metal ones.andM;Because LaserLAN is a new product, no user names were available.andM;SimpleNET Systems can be contacted at 545 W. Lambert Road, Suite A, Brea,Calif.andP;  92621 (714) 529-8850.andM;10NET 10-MEGABIT FIBER LAN, 10Net Communications Inc.andP;  10Net Communicationsoffers fiber-optic LANs for Ethernet that operate at 1M or 10M bps.andM;The 10Net 10Megabit Fiber LAN is similar to the 1M-bit version, supportingIBM PC, XT, AT and compatible computers.andP;  It uses eight-node hubs with amaximum of 65 hubs and 392 nodes per network.andM;The maximum distance from hub to hub or from hub to PC is 3 kilometers, andthe maximum total distance covered by the network is 6 kilometers.andM;The network can use 100/140-micron, 62.5-micron or 50-micron cable, and workswith SMA connectors.andM;Unlike many fiber LAN hardware vendors, 10Net also sells network-operatingsoftware.andP;  A fiber-optic network-interface board bundled with 10Net softwarecosts $795.andP;  By itself, the fiber board costs $765.andP;  An eight-node hub costs$1,995, and 10Net's Enhanced Fiber Repeater costs $795.andP;  Tempest-secureversions of both the 1M-bit and the 10M-bit LANs are available.andM;10Net Communications Inc. is located at Washington Park I, 7887 WashingtonVillage Drive, Dayton, Ohio 45459 (513) 433-2238.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;The Elliott-Pope Preparatory School in Idyllwild, Calif., has personalcomputers scattered over about 10 acres.andP;  The school decided a little morethan a year ago to link its PCs with a campuswide network and chose 10Net'sFiber LAN as a backbone between buildings.andM;Within buildings, clusters of PCs are linked by conventional copper wire.andO;Five fiber links tie them to a '386-based PC that acts as a file server.andM;Gene Jones, director of computer services at the school, said a key advantageof using fiber for the building-to-building links is its immunity tolightning strikes.andP;  The capacity of fiber and the distances it can cover weresecondary concerns, he said.andM;The Elliott-Pope School had first-hand experience of one advantage of fiberoptics when it lost the ground on part of its electrical system.andM;A power surge traveled from one PC through copper wire connecting that PC tothree others.andP;  Three computers and a half-dozen network boards were ruined.andO;But when the surge reached the fiber-optic part of the network, it could gono farther.andP;  ''It's a safety valve,'' Jones remarked.andM;Jones praised 10Net's support.andP;  ''When you have a problem or a question,'' hesaid, ''technical support will always get back to you that same day, and thepeople you talk to are always very knowledgeable.''andM;Jones has rarely had to call on this support, however, as the network hasbeen ''very reliable.''andM;Robert Cugini, vice president of Barbee Mill in Renton, Wash., also praised10Net's support.andP;  ''As far as getting support, getting answers back andgetting help,'' he said, ''I have had no problems whatsoever.''andM;Barbee Mill, a wood-products manufacturer, has a 10-node 10Net system in itsoffice building with an optical-fiber link running to the manufacturing plantabout 1,000 feet away.andM;One advantage of this is preparation for the future, Cugini said.andP;  ''I don'thave to worry in 10 years if I have another technology whether the cable isgoing to support it or not,'' he added.andM;Alumax, in Goose Creek, S.C., makes aluminum, a process that ''creates a lotof magnetic fields, a lot of electrical interference,'' said Gene Ashley,systems support specialist.andP;  The Charleston area also has many lightningstorms.andP;  Both were reasons for installing optical fiber in Alumax'smanufacturing plant.andM;10Net was chosen largely because Alumax is a large customer of DCACommunications, 10Net's parent.andP;  ''We wanted the integration into DCA asthoroughly as we could,'' Ashley said.andM;Alumax has connected six nodes to its 10Net LAN so far, in two clusters.andO;Installation ''didn't seem to be that difficult,'' Ashley said.andM;The network has generally worked well.andP;  On one occasion when Alumax neededhelp, 10Net sent a technician to Goose Creek to take care of the problem.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
