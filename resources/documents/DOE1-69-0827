Analyticaltechniques require excessive computation and are often cumbersome touse. Present requirements call for integrated software systems whichinclude sophisticated man-machine interfaces with colour graphics. Thisresearch is intended to combine analytical algorithms with the logicprogramming of rule-based systems in order to provide an interactivedecision-support tool. In designing the software required for these functions,the three areas of computation, namely numerical analysis, interactivecomputation and logic programming are considered. PASCAL has been chosenas the implementation language for the first two areas while PROLOG willbe used for implementing an expert system.</TEXT></DOC>
