 When your overloaded drive begins to shout, &quot;There isnot enought room on the disk ...&quot; you can buy a bigger one -- but whathappens when that one fills up?andM;Absolute date security has traditionally also been a simple concept:  It'simpossible.andP;  Even a rugged hard drive can fail, and the most carefullycoddled backup tape can mysteriously mangle precious data.andP;  Although gooddata-recovery software can recover 90 percent of fractured files, Murphy'sLaw decress that your mose crucial data will reside somewhere in that missing10 percent.andM;Now there's an entirely new type of drive, one that combines the unlimitedcapacity of a removable-cartridge system with the ability to write data inpermanent, unalterable, unerasable form.andP;  What's more, both operations userugged, reliable optical technology and both use cartridges that can containas much as 1,000 megabytes of data.andP;  There multifunction drives use botherasable optical and WORM (write once, read many) cartridges -- and some areselling for about the price of drives that can accept only one type ofcartridge.andM;This month MacUser Labs looks at three mechanisms that combine WORM anderasable optical technologies.andP;  When we began our testing, only onemanufacturer -- Pioneer -- shipping a Mac-capable mechanism, the DE-S7001.andO;The Panasonic LF-7010 and the Hewlett-Packard Model 650/A (based on a Sonymechanism and modified by Hewlett-Packard) quickly followed.andP;  As we went topress, more than a dozen vendors had packaged one or more of these mechanismsinto drives that connect to your Mac (see Table 2) and Sony released itsversion of the Hewlett-Packard drive mechanism.andM;Erasable optical drives offer the same read/write capabilities as hard drivesdo (see &quot;Erasable Optical Drives,&quot; November '90, page 102).andP;  They're fasterthan WORM drives, four to five times faster than CD-ROM drives, and gettingfaster every year.andP;  Today's models are even fast enough to be used as startupdrives -- although the most efficient configuration is to keep your SystemFolder and applications on a small, fast hard-disk drive and your data fileson optical discs.andP;  Although this approach is somewhat slower than using ahard drive for everything, it enables you to take advantage of the erasableoptical drive's unlimited storage capacity.andM;Erasable optical drives also offer advantages over tape drives for backup.andO;Because erasable discs are mountable volumes that look and act like harddisks and the desktop, you can access your data on an optical disc if yourhard disk fails -- without having to restore your data to a hard disk.andP;  Datafrom an optical drive can also be retrieved more quickly than can data on atape, because optical mechanisms (like hard drives) can randomly access datainstead of having to search sequentially, as do tape drives.andP;  And if you needimmediate access to data that's backed up on a tape but don't have a healthyhard disk onto which you can restore it, you're probably out of luck -- mosttape drives cannot be mounted on the desktop.andP;  Erasable optical discs arealso more durable, having a shelf life of around 15 years compared with about5 for tape.andM;WORM discs are optimum for permanent archiving, because data written to thencannot be altered or overwritten.andP;  With an estimated media shelf life of upto 100 years, WORM is the ideal electronic archival technology.andP;  Unlike tapeor microfiche, WORM technology offers quick on-line access in a rugged andcompact format.andM;Multifunction MechanismsandM;Each of the three multifunction mechanisms we looked at uses 5.25-inchoptical cartridges -- but each uses a radically different method of storingdata.andP;  The Pioneer DE-S7001 mechanisms uses MO (magneto-optical) erasable andablative WORM technologies, the Hewlett-Packard Model 650/A uses MO erasabletechnology and a new type of MO WORM technology, and the Panasonic LF-7010uses a nonstandard technology for both its WORM and erasable modes.andM;The Pioneer mechanism, like that of most erasable optical drives, writes toan erasable disc.andP;  A laser heats a spot on the disc to about 150 degreescentigrade, at which point the spot takes on the polarity of an electromagneton the other side of the disc (see the &quot;How It Works: Multifunction OpticalStorage&quot; sidebar).andP;  This combination of heat, electromagnetism, and lightgives MO its other name.andP;  TMO, for thermal magneto-optical technology.andM;One benefit of MO technology is that the temperature at which the MO mediacan have its polarity changed (150 degrees centigrade) is high enough toprevent media alteration at room temperature.andP;  It's also relatively harmlessto the media, which can withstand up to 10,000,000 erase/write cycles.andP;  Anerase pass must be performed, however, to make the polarity of a sectoruniform before th write pass can be made.andP;  The erase pass effectively doublesthe write time.andP;  The Pioneer DE-S7001, which is compatible with Pioneer'sother erasable optical drives, fits more data on a disc than does theHewlett-Packard Model 650/A.andP;  But the formatting method used by Pioneer forthe SE-S7001, unlike that used by either the Panasonic LF-7010 or theHewlett-Packard Model 650/A, resembles that of a hard disk, making itvulnerable to performance reduction due to data fragmentation, just like ahard disk.andM;The Pioneer DE-S7001's WORM mode uses the time-tested ablative technique, inwhich the laser cuts into the media, creating a permanent pit.andP;  WORMcartridges used in the DE-S7001 mechanism are also compatible with Pioneer'spopular DD-5001 WORK drives.andP;  A particularly handy feature of the DE-S7001 isits frontpanel lights, which tell you whether an erasable or a WORM cartridgeis in the drive.andM;The Hewlett-Packard Model 650/A mechanism uses MO-technology metholds for itserasable as well as its WORM modes.andP;  The Model 650/A uses a write-protectedMO cartridge when in WORM mode.andP;  Custom tracks on the MO disc tell thedrive's firmware to switch to WORM mode and to implement three levels ofwrite protection so that only empty blocks on the disc can be written to.andO;The Hewlett-Packard WORM medium has the same 10-year archival life as anerasable optical disc instead of the centure life span boaster by someablative-WORM discs, meaning that it's a much less durable archiving medium.andO;The erasable format is compatible with drives based on MaxOptix, Ricoh,Sharp, and Sony mechanisms.andM;A major advantage of the Panasonic LF-7010 is that its phase-change mechanismcan directly overwrite data.andP;  This capability makes the LF-7010 write abouttwice as fast as MO mechanisms, which require a separate erase pass beforewriting.andP;  A laser changes the structure of the 1,000-megabyte erasable disc'smetal alloy between an amorphous, or random, state and a crystalline, orhighly ordered, state.andP;  This is a more drastic change to the media than thancaused by MO technology, and it lowers the number of overwrite cycles to100,000 -- 1 percent of that of MO.andM;The LF-7010 keeps track of which sectors are approaching the 100,000-cyclethreshold and prevents writing to these sectors (the drive does continue toallow reading from these sectors, however), which reduces the writable spaceon discs as they age.andP;  This threshold might be a concern on a heavily usedfile server but shouldn't pose a problem for most desktop uses.andP;  And ofcourse, you can always change discs.andM;The Panasonic LF-7010 also uses phase-change technology in WORM mode.andP;  Likethe write-protected MO WORM media used by the Hewlett-Packard Model 650/A,the LF-7010's WORM media contain code that tells the drive to switch to WORMmode and to implement write-protection methods to ensure that data is notoverwritten.andM;The chemical composition of the WORM media is different, making it impossibleto alter a sector once data has been written to it.andP;  The LF-7010 can write toand read 940-megabyte double-sided and 470-megabyte single-sided WORMcartridges used in Panasonic's other WORM drives.andM;One significant weakness of the LF-7010 is that its WORM media are guaranteedfor only 10 years -- nowhere near the 100-year expected life span of someablative-WORM discs.andP;  Also noteworthy is that the Panasonic LF-7010'serasable discs contain tellurium -- a toxic heavy metal.andP;  Users areprotected, in that the metal is sealed within the disc, but check with alocal environmental-protection agency for guidelines on how to dispose of olddiscs properly.andM;Another unfriendly aspect of the LF-7010 is that ejecting a cartridgerequires two operations -- pushing a button on the drive and then draggingthe icon to the Trasd.andP;  The other two mechanisms obey the Mac convention ofspitting out the cartridge when you drag its icon into the Trash.andP;  But formost users, this slight inconvenience will be more than outweighed by theLF-7010's price -- at $3,995 it's the least expensive multifunction mechanismwe've seen.andM;Speed, Spin, and SoftwareandM;As with hard drives, driver software plays an important part inmultifunction-drive performance.andP;  Although the three mechanisms we testedcame directly from the manufacturers, competing products using the samemechanisms and different driver software may have significantly differentperformance.andP;  For out tests, we used drivers written by Optical AccessInternational on the Pioneer and Panasonic mechanisms.andP;  We also used a driverfrom Corel on the Panasonic unit.andP;  Software Architect's Formatter One, ageneric driver, was used on the Hewlett-Packard mechanism, because no driversspecific to this mechanism were available.andM;Of the three mechanisms, only the Pioneer DE-S7001 had Mac software shippingat press time--we used beta copies of drivers for the Panasonic andHewlett-Packard mechanisms.andP;  Even though it was a shipping version, thePioneer mechanism was the slowest in all our tests--in erasable as well as inWORM mode.andP;  (The Hewlett-Packard mechanism's Macintosh-compatible WORM modewas not yet ready for testing at press time, because of its lack of driversoftware.)andM;We were impressed by the easy-to-use formatter software and usefuldiagnostics that came with the drivers from Optical Access.andP;  The AccessHistories DA, which works in WORM mode, is particularly useful.andP;  Athough youcan't erase files from a WORM disc, you can write a new directory thatignores previously written files so they appear to have been erased.andP;  TheAccess Histories DA lets you &quot;reset&quot; your WORM drive to any previousdirectory, giving you access to files on the disc as well as creating asequential history of the disc itself.andM;As expected, the Panasonic LF-7010's write time in erasable mode proved to betwice as fast as the Pioneer DE-S7001's, because of the former's combinederase/write pass.andP;  The Hewlett-Packard mechanism performed nearly as well asthe Panasonic unit, because it spins the disc at 2,400 rpm--one-thord fasterthan the others -- increasing throughput by moving more data past the head inthe same amount of time.andM;A Standard FutureandM;If your hard drive has filled up and it appears you may have to resort tousing compression software to cram more data into it or if you're worriedabout data security but can't justify the price of a WORM-only drive, amultifunction optical drive and a few cartridges might be your idealsolution.andP;  Which mechanism you should choose, however, is a more difficultdecision.andM;It's likely that one of the three multi-function mechanisms we previewed willdominate the field in the next two years, but it's difficult to say which oneit'll be.andP;  The Panasonic LF-7010 has the edge in speed, and the PioneerDE-S7001 uses current standards for both erasable and WORM.andP;  Sony, whichrecently announced its own multifunction mechanism -- upon which theHewlett-Packard Model 650/A mechanism is based -- is perhaps the biggestforce in the optical market, however.andM;The promise of further development in phase-change technologies and opticalstorage in general (see the &quot;Optical Lite&quot; sidebar) makes us hope that thespeedy Panasonic mechanism will hold its own against Sony's influence whenfuture standards are established.andM;Optical LifeandM;Watching your budget as well as your megabytes?andP;  Well, you no longer have topay more for an optical drive than you did for your Mac--3.5-inch erasableoptical drives are here.andP;  These drives can store up to 128 megabytes,considerably less than their 650-to-1,000-megabyte counterparts, on aremovable cartridge.andP;  But they do offer the same level of data security, withthe portability of floppy disks and a speed that's close to that of a typicalhard drive.andM;The current speed leaders are the Ocean Technologies Ocean Vista 130 and thePinnacle Micro Pinacle REO-130, based on the RMD-5100-S mechanism, from MOST.andO;These drives boast an average seek time of 35 milliseconds -- faster than any5.25-inch optical unit.andP;  Unfortunately, the drives themselves are not thatmuch smaller than 5.25-inch drives.andP;  The price hasn't shrunk that mucheither, with drives for the Mac costing about $3,000.andP;  Disc cartridges costabout $130, half the price of 5.25-inch optical cartridges.andM;A new generation of 3.5-inch optical mechanisms with further reduced priceand size should be available to drive manufaturers by the time you read this.andO;Optical Access International is offering a new drive, called the Access 350,based on a mechanism from Panasonic that has an access time of 40milliseconds.andP;  Not only are the cartridges approximately the same size asfloppy disks but because this mechanism is about the same size as the Mac'sfloppy drive, it can also be installed inside a Mac in place of a floppydrive.andP;  The mechanism weighs less than a hard drive, so it will make a goodstorage choice for a portable Mac--if it doesn't require too much power.andP;  TheAccess 350 has a list price of $1,999 (media prices were unavailable at presstime).andP;  Optical Access International, Inc., 800 W. Cummings Park, Ste.andP;  2050,Woburn, MA 01801; (800) 433-5133 0r (617) 937-3910.andM;Although Optical Access should be the first to ship a drive that uses this3.5-inch Panasonic mechanism, it is likely that other vendors will offersimilar drives.andP;  With their high capacity, imperviousness to magnetic fields,and small size, this coming generation of 3.5-inch erasable optical drivespromises to be a superior alternative to magnetic SyQuest, Ricoh, andBernoulli drives.andM;The Bottom LineandM;A multifunction optical drive offers unlimited storage as well as theultimate in data security, because it can accept both erasable and WORM(write once, read many) cartridges.andP;  Three multifunction technologies arecurrently available in mechanisms manufactured by Panasonic, Pioneer, Sony(not available for review), and Hewlett-Packard (based on the Sonymechanisms).andP;  With the exception of the tests we conducted with the Pioneermechanism, all our tests were performed with unreleased driversoftware--although both Panasonic and Hewlett-Packard should have completedtheir software by press time.andM;The choice among mechanisms boils down to conventional magneto-optical versusphase-change arasable technologies and ablative versus magneto-optical WORMtechnologies.andP;  Of the erasable technologies, we recommend the PanasonicLF-7010 phase-change mechanism ($3,995) -- it has the fastest speed and thehighest capacity.andP;  Of the WORM techniques, the ablative technology of thePioneer DE-S7001 ($5,090) ensures the longest life for your data.andP;  However,the speed and larger capacity of Panasonic's media, as well as the promise ofincreased durability in the future, make its phase-change WORM a solidalternative to the Pioneer DE-S7001's ablative WORM.andM;Our overall choice for a multifunction-drive mechanism is the PanasonicLF-7010.andP;  In addition to having faster speed and higher capacity, it's alsothe least expensive of the three mechanisms.andP;  However, because of the limitednumber of read/write cycles that phase-change discs can handle, you may wantto consider our second choice, the Hewlett-Packard Model 650/A ($6,435).andO;It's slower than the Panasonic mechanism and more expensive; it's big too--adrive containing it takes up almost as much desk space as a Mac IIci.andO;However, it can read and write erasable optical discs from drives based onMaxOptix, Ricoh, Sharp, or Sony mechanisms.andM;A multifunction drive based on the Pioneer DE-S7001 mechanism is recommendedit you need to share WORM and erasable cartridges with other Pioneer-baseddrives and it you need absolute maximum data security.andP;  It's slower than theother two mechanisms, but it's well built, takes up the least amount of deskspace, and is less expensive than the Hewlett-Packard Unit.andP;  It also uses anablative-WORM mechanism--a real benefit if you need to archive something fordecades.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
