Treasury bond prices fell at first but later rebounded to finish at about the same levels as late Friday. The Treasury's new 30-year bonds were quoted yesterday afternoon at a yield of 9.06%, up slightly from 9.05% Friday.    The Commodity Research Bureau's futures index, a closely watched barometer of inflation pressures, rose 4.42 points yesterday to 259.52. That followed sharp increases last week.    Earlier this year, even small increases in the index often sent shock waves through the credit markets. Lately, though, the CRB index has been rising mainly because dry weather conditions in the Midwest have imperiled the key soybean and corn crops. In futures trading yesterday, both corn and soybean contracts rose as much as they are permitted to in a single day.    Helping to diffuse the impact of the agricultural-sector futures increases were declines in crude oil futures. But some participants think the agricultural product gains, if they continue, will be too much to ignore.    Bob Wasilewski, a vice president at ASB Capital Management in Washington, D.C., contended that at some point down the road the CRB futures index gains will mean higher food prices and that the bond market will have to &quot;deal with it later in the year.&quot;    While some contend the CRB index doesn't foreshadow inflation, Mr. Wasilewski countered that it reflects the &quot;first part of the production process.&quot;    Mr. Wasilewski said his firm has been taking some profits at the higher price levels and is raising cash, now at 30% of the $2.5 billion fixed-income portfolio. That cash position is up from about 25% a month ago, he said. Wage inflation, he warned, is &quot;on the verge of picking up.&quot;    Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said one reason bond investors aren't focusing on the CRB futures index is that they are &quot;very impressed&quot; with recent dollar stability and that &quot;more and more think the dollar will stabilize at current levels. There are fewer and fewer adherents to the view that the dollar must decline sharply.&quot;    Moreover, Mr. Platt argued that investors are more &quot;discriminate&quot; in how they view the CRB futures index. Agricultural futures price increases are being viewed as less threatening than wage price pressures.    Mr. Platt said investors could begin paying more attention to the CRB index, particularly if the May producer price report, to be released Friday, rekindles inflationary jitters. &quot;Friday's PPI is crucial in that respect,&quot; he said. He expects an increase of 0.5% or 0.6%, after a 0.4% increase in April.    William Mawhorter, a portfolio manager at Govaars andamp; Associates in Newport Beach, Calif., said he hasn't paid much attention to the CRB index, saying it contains too much &quot;expectational pricing.&quot; Last month, when the index did influence the bond market, the market &quot;was in different technical shape&quot; after a quarterly U.S. Treasury financing operation that was &quot;poorly placed,&quot; he said.    Longer term, Mr. Mawhorter remains bearish on the bond market. He contended that long-term Treasury yields are &quot;headed toward 10% over the next year or so.&quot;    Foreign Bonds   Prices of gilts, or British government issues, rose as United Kingdom authorities moved to bolster the pound.    Some bellwether gilts ended the day higher by about three-quarters of a point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount.    Frequently, higher short-term interest rates lead to higher rates on all maturities. But long-term rates fell as gilt traders were encouraged by the perception that the government was taking the threat of inflation more seriously.    &quot;It is not so much the level of short-term rates,&quot; said one observer. &quot;The strong stance against inflation is very encouraging for the market.&quot;    One dealer reported that &quot;it is the first time in a week or more that we have seen some genuine interest in the market.&quot;    Major British banks raised their base rates to 8 1/2% from 8%, the second increase in less than a week. The increase in the base rates, which are the benchmark for commercial lending in Britain, had been expected by numerous analysts. The Bank of England signaled the latest rise by again lifting one of its main money-market intervention rates.    The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 ended 22/32 higher at 118 16/32 to yield 9.39%. Among shorter-dated gilts, the Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 1991 gained 6/32 to close at 105 27/32 with a yield of 9.16%, while the Treasury 12% issue due 1995 finished 9/32 higher at 111 27/32 to yield 9.54%.    In West Germany, government bond prices edged higher. The government's 6 1/2% issue due 1998 closed in interdealer trading at 99.60 to yield 6.55%. This compared with a 6.59% yield and a bid price of 99.35 late Friday.    In Tokyo, Japanese government bond prices ended only slightly higher, as several attempts to rally the market fizzled.    The benchmark 5% No. 105 issue closed at a yield of 4.515% in the interdealer market, down 1.5 basis points on the day. The range on the session was 4.475% to 4.535%. The closing yield on the bellwether bond represents a price of 103.22.    Treasury Securities   Trading was dominated largely by dealers, with few institutional investors participating.    Prices of some long-term Treasury bonds slumped nearly 5/8 point early in the day before bouncing back. The Treasury's 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 sank to as low as about 100 1/8 before rebounding. They closed at 100 5/8, down slightly from 100 3/4 Friday.    The government's 9% notes due 1998 dipped to 100 7/32 from 100 9/32 Friday. The yield rose to 8.97% from 8.96%.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds also was little changed. The index dipped 0.85 point to 1237.64. The low was 1232.86, and the high was 1239.32.    The Treasury sold new short-term bills yesterday at lower rates than at last week's auction. The average rate on new 13-week bills declined to 6.44% from 6.53% last week, while the average on new 26-week bills dropped to 6.72% from 6.83%.    Here are details:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                  13-Week         26-Week    Applications .......... $26,103,065,000  $24,100,745,000    Accepted bids .......... $6,436,365,000   $6,411,425,000    Accepted at low price               31%              81%    Accepted noncompet'ly      $961,950,000     $857,165,000    Average price (Rate)     98.372 (6.44%)   96.603 (6.72%)    High price (Rate) ...... 98.377 (6.42%)   96.628 (6.67%)    Low price (Rate) ....... 98.370 (6.45%)   96.603 (6.72%)    Coupon equivalent ......          6.64%            7.05%    Both issues are dated June 9. The 13-week bills mature Sept. 8, 1988, and the 26-week bills mature Dec. 8, 1988.   Municipals   Municipal bonds finished unchanged to slightly weaker in lackluster activity.   &quot;Our market kind of just sat there,&quot; a New York trader said. Although the climbing Commodities Research Bureau index wasn't a major influence, &quot;it might be keeping munis from doing too much&quot; on the upside, the trader said.   On tap for today is the pricing of Ohio's $100 million issue of highway obligation bonds, Series D. The issue is slated for competitive bidding at 11 a.m. EDT.   Also scheduled for today is the pricing of a proposed $63.5 million issue of highway revenue bonds by the Indiana Transportation Finance Authority. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. heads the underwriting group. The issue is expected to include serial bonds maturing from 1991 to 2003 and term bonds due in 2008 and 2011, according to a Shearson official.   Corporate Issues   Prices of corporate bonds finished flat to off slightly in light trading.   New-issue activity also was light. Underwriters and traders continue to use the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017, rather than the new 9 1/8% bonds due 2018, as their pricing gauge because the spread between the new issue and the old one remains fairly wide. That spread now is about five basis points.   Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage securities finished narrowly mixed after generally quiet dealings.   The June 9% issue and the 9 1/2% issue outpaced other Ginnie Mae coupons amid talk that some Wall Street firms are accumulating the issues for Remic offerings. A Remic is a real estate mortgage investment conduit.   The June 9% issue was quoted late yesterday at 93 26/32 bid, unchanged. The 9 1/2% issue was quoted at 93 24/32, down 1/32, and the 10% issue at 99 5/8, down 3/32. The 9% issue is yielding 10.04% to a 12-year average life.   The Ginnie Mae 9% and 9 1/2% issues appeal to Remic deal makers because they are plentiful in a market where so many mortgage securities, particularly those issued Freddie Macs and Fannie Maes, are in short supply.   There are $70 billion of Ginnie Mae 9% securities outstanding, making them the single largest issue of fixed-income securities in the world. There are about $42 billion of 9 1/2% securities outstanding.</TEXT></DOC>
