The system, linking 245 armed services and defenselogistics sites across the country, will enable the DefenseDepartment to build, maintain and support weapon systemswithout such paper documents as technical manuals,engineering drawings and training manuals, Computer Sciencessaid.</LP><TEXT>   JCALS, short for Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition andLogistic Support, should result in a &quot;vast reduction in paperassociated with a weapons system,&quot; the Army said in astatement announcing the award. JCALS will apparentlyfunction as an umbrella over various computer programs atdifferent branches of the armed services.   &quot;This gives us the financial base to develop a capabilitythat competitors can't go off and do,&quot; said Jeff Plotnick, aComputer Sciences vice president and the project director.Eventually, weapons makers will be tied directly into thecomputer system. &quot;It will make sense for them to come to us,&quot;Mr. Plotnick said.   El Segundo, Calif.-based Computer Sciences said thecontract is the second largest federal contract it has everreceived and one of the largest in its history. Technologiesthat will be developed for the new government system havecommercial applications that the company will use to attractfuture non-government business, a spokeswoman said.   Computer Sciences was one of eight initial bidders on theproject. A year ago, the Army narrowed the field ofcompetitors to Computer Sciences and Xerox, which each builtprototype systems. Those systems were demonstrated lastsummer and the contract was awarded yesterday.   The JCALS project will employ about 250 people, of whichroughly two-thirds will be new hires, Mr. Plotnick said. The12year term of the project is probably just the beginning, hesaid, because the system will need to be continually upgradedover its lifetime.   Computer Sciences said its major subcontractors on theproject are five Virginia concerns: General Research Corp., aunit of GRC International Inc., Vienna; Systems Research andamp;Applications Corp., Arlington; Management Action Corp.,Manassas; NCI Information Systems, Arlington, and InfoDesignCorp., Alexandria.   A Xerox spokeswoman in California said the company isdisappointed about losing the competition. The business andelectronic printing services concern is based in Stamford,Conn.   In late New York Stock Exchange trading, Computer Scienceswas up 37.5 cents at $68; Xerox was down $1.125 at $63.875.</TEXT></DOC>
