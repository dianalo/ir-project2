In a unanimous judgement,Supreme Court judges upheld two previous rulings by senior courts inQuebec and Newfoundland. Their decision effectively affirms the sanctityof the 65-year contract, which the Peckford government has tried to overturn.This decision was the second time in four years that the Supreme Courthas ruled unanimously against attempts by Newfoundland to alter the ChurchillFalls agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
