The changed attitude toward the Sandinista government has beensubtle compared with the mutual recriminations and finger-pointingthat now characterize the relationship between the State Departmentand some elements of Nicaragua's exiled opposition.   By de-emphasizing military pressure against the Sandinistagovernment, the United States has moved away from theconfrontational policies of the Reagan administration and is nowpursuing peaceful but guarded coexistence.   The shift has embittered some Contras. ``No one in theresistance trusts the State Department,'' says Bosco Matamoros, arebel spokesman who is closely allied with veteran Contra leaderAdolfo Calero.   Calero was once a regular visitor to the White House and theState Department during the Reagan years but nowadays is treatedalmost as an outcast by the Bush administration.   Matamoros maintains that the State Department has refused evento answer rebel correspondence while abandoning the Reaganadministration policy of avoiding all substantive contact withSandinista leaders. When a congressional delegation met recentlywith President Daniel Ortega, a top State Department officialparticipated.   Amid the ongoing debate over when the Contras should disband,Matamoros said the State Department ``seems more interested thanthe Sandinistas in demobilizing the resistance.''   One continuing source of concern for the administration isSoviet bloc military aid for the Sandinistas, estimated at $350million for the first eight months of this year.   The administration view is that the Contra leadership mantle haspassed from Miami-based civilians to battle-hardened Contra fieldcommanders who have risen through the ranks and are far morequalified to represent the armed opposition to the Sandinistas.   Officials talk disdainfully of the U.S. taxpayer-financed Contrabureaucracy which has operated for years in Miami. Matamorosaccused State Department officials of grossly exaggerating the sizeof the Contras' paid staff.   By turning its back on Contra civilian leaders who have refusedto return to the region and by favoring the emerging militarycommanders within the resistance, Matamoros says the Bushadministration is tacitly advocating a military coup despite itsstated preference for civilian supremacy.   The administration's twin objectives for Nicaragua are tosupport the internal opposition there as the country gears up fornational elections and to keep the armed resistance intact untilafter the Feb. 25 balloting.   The bulk of the rebel force is based at camps along the Honduranborder, living off U.S.-supplied humanitarian assistance.   Central American presidents have called for the demobilizationof the rebels by Dec. 5 but the Bush administration regards thatdeadline as irrelevant because the presidents also said that anysuch process must be voluntary.   The administration believes that the presence of rebel forcesalong the border serves as an incentive for the Sandinistas tofulfill their promise of a free and fair election.   At the same time, the Bush administration is trying to devise away to assist Nicaragua's fledgling democratic process withoutproviding direct support to the campaign of the principalopposition candidate, Violeta Chamorro. Meanwhile, theadministration seems willing to live with a Sandinista victoryprovided the process is reasonably honest.   Calero likens the more permissive U.S. attitude toward theSandinistas to the appeasement policies that led to World War II.   ``Rather than pressing for military assistance, Secretary ofState James A. Baker joked about relocating the Contras to hisTexas ranch,'' Calero has written.   Such an attitude, he said, could deprive Nicaragua of democracywhile damaging U.S. security interests in region.</TEXT></DOC>
