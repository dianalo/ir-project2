Background on the Arkansas Program</ITAG>On November 21, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approvedthe Arkansas program. General background information on the Arkansas program,including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and theconditions of approval of the Arkansas program can be found in the November21, 1980, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (45 FR 77003). Subsequent actions concerningArkansas' program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 904.10,904.12, 904.15, and 904.16.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion</ITAG>By letter dated December 22, 1988 (Administrative Record No. AR-347), Arkansassubmitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Arkansassubmitted the proposed amendment in response to a November 26, 1985, letterthat OSMRE sent in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(c), and to satisfy requiredprogram amendments at 30 CFR 904.16 (a) and (b). OSMRE announced receiptof the proposed amendment in the January 13, 1989, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 1398).Arkansas' proposed amendment included revisions to parts of the ArkansasSurface Coal Mining and Reclamation Code (ASCMRC) pertaining to restrictionof financial interest of employees, fish and wildlife information, individualcivil penalties, the replanting of trees and shrubs as a normal husbandrypractice, and measurement of revegetation success on prime farmland.Withdrawal of Proposed AmendmentAs required by 30 CFR 904.16(a) (53 FR 9885, March 28, 1988), Arkansasproposed to amend ASCMRC 816.116 (b)(3)(ii) and (c)(4), and 816.117 (a)(2)(ii),(b)(1), and (b)(3), regarding the revegetation success criteria for bondrelease as they relate to the replacement of trees and shrubs as a normalhusbandry practice. However, in the September 7, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 34636), OSMRE announced revised Federalregulations on revegetation in response to the District Court's decision(PSMRL II) and lifted the suspensions on 30 CFR 816/817.116. As a result,OSMRE notified Arkansas by letter dated March 15, 1989 (AdministrativeRecord No. AR-354), that Arkansas' existing program was no less effectivethan the revised Federal regulations regarding revegetation. Therefore,Arkansas, by letter dated April 17, 1989 (Administrative Record No. AR-355),requested withdrawal of the proposed amendment that it submitted in responseto the required program amendment at 30 CFR 904.16(a), and that OSMRE announcedin the January 13, 1989, <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Arkansas did not withdraw the other provisionsof its proposed amendment. OSMRE intends, during the final rulemaking decisionon this amendment, to remove the required amendment on Arkansas' programfound at 30 CFR 904.16(a).Submission of Revised AmendmentDuring its review of Arkansas' December 22, 1988, amendment, OSMRE identifiedconcerns relating to the proposed regulations at ASCMRC 1000 (50). As proposed,ASCMRC 1000 (50) would suspend ASCMRC 823.11(c). ASCMRC 823.11(c) requiresthe use of actual crop production from reclaimed prime farmlands in determiningwhether revegetation is successful. OSMRE notified Arkansas of its concernsby letter dated March 15, 1989 (Administrative Record No. AR-354). Arkansasresponded in a letter dated April 26, 1989, by submitting a revised amendmentpackage (Administrative Record No. AR-356) in which it documented its intentionto remove the suspension of ASCMRC 823.11(c) found at ASCMRC 1000 (50).<ITAG tagnum="84">III.
