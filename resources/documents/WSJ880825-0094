Some traders expect the dollar to rise further in the next few days.    Persistent selling by major industrial nations, said to have been led by the U.S., dragged the dollar from its highs in afternoon New York trading. But the currency still posted gains for the day of 0.5% against the mark and 0.7% against the pound. It was flat against the yen.    In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.9075 marks, up from 1.8970 marks Friday, and at 133.66 yen, up from 133.65 yen. The pound traded at $1.6860, down from $1.6982 Friday.    In Tokyo trading Tuesday morning, the U.S. currency opened at 133.75 yen.    The rising U.S. interest rates that helped spur the dollar rally sent the stock market in the opposite direction. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 25.78 points to close at 1990.22, below the 2000 level for the first time in nearly three months.    Some dollar traders said they think the outbreak of intervention in the currency markets yesterday may signal a new struggle between traders and investors, who are willing to pay more for dollars, and the major industrial nations, which want to limit its rise.    Currency traders described the intervention as light to moderate and said it had only a limited effect on the currency's gain. Along with the U.S. Federal Reserve -- which declined to comment on reports of its intervention, as is its policy -- the West German Bundesbank, Bank of England, Bank of France and central banks of half a dozen other European countries were reported to have sold dollars, in generally modest but unspecified amounts, to try to halt the currency's advance.    The Bank of Japan wasn't believed to be in the market, however. Shigeru Tokunaga, vice president and foreign-exchange manager in New York for Japan's Fuji Bank Ltd., said this was because the yen remained generally stable against the dollar. In addition, he said, many Japanese traders and economists expect the U.S. currency to show little change against the yen in the short term, and believe it will decline against the Japanese currency over the next six to 12 months.    The coordinated selling of dollars by the U.S. and West Germany continued the central banks' recent practice of intervening when the dollar rises significantly above 1.90 marks, and didn't appear to represent any change in policy. U.S. officials expect Bonn to raise some interest rates this week, a move that could bolster the mark and limit further dollar rises. Such a move apparently would be viewed favorably by the U.S.    There isn't any current plan for officials of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations to meet again until Sept. 22. G-7 nations include the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. U.S. policy on the dollar is being managed by Acting Treasury Secretary Peter McPherson pending Senate confirmation of investment banker Nicholas Brady as Treasury Secretary, which is expected in mid-September.    Marc M. Goloven, vice president and economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said he believes the dollar's strong showing reflects a fundamental change in foreign-exchange-market psychology since the beginning of the year. Now, he said, traders and corporations are looking for reasons to buy the U.S. currency and are interpreting almost any economic news with a pro-dollar bias.    This mood is giving the currency a temporary immunity to the kind of news that would have sent it lower several months ago, when the market was extremely bearish on the dollar. What's behind the shift in psychology, he said, is that &quot;everyone is looking for a high-yield currency&quot; as inflation rates start to creep higher around the industrialized world.    U.S. interest rates are well above those in West Germany and Japan and heading higher, making dollar-denominated investments more alluring. With the U.S. trade deficit &quot;at least on a slow mend,&quot; Mr. Goloven said, investors feel confident the dollar won't plunge in the near future.    He said last week's report that the trade gap in June widened to $12.54 billion from a revised $9.76 billion for May hasn't been a major negative factor for the dollar because the market isn't convinced that the one-month figure represents a trend. The year-to-year numbers are more telling, Mr. Goloven said. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit averaged $10.87 billion a month in this year's second quarter, compared with an average of $14.12 billion a month a year earlier.    Some other economists and analysts, while acknowledging that the dollar is in demand, said its upturn might not last. David Ogg, vice president and chief foreign-exchange dealer for Credit Suisse in New York, said the dollar will probably trade in a narrow range for the foreseeable future and perhaps until after the U.S. presidential elections in November.    Mr. Tokunaga said Japanese dealers have a large amount of orders to sell dollars when the currency reaches 135 yen, and numerous short-covering orders to buy dollars at 132 yen. Therefore, he said, the dollar may have difficulty breaking out of that range for some time.    An official of a West German bank, who asked not to be identified, called the dollar's jump yesterday to as high as 1.9230 marks in early New York trading &quot;ephemeral.&quot; He said it was a continuing reaction to the prospect of higher interest rates in the U.S. but will be partly offset by the expected increase in West German rates. However, he said he expects the dollar to remain in the range of 1.80 to 1.90 marks for the rest of the year, assuming the U.S. trade balance continues to improve.    In the short term, the West German bank official said, the dollar probably will continue to be supported by U.S. economic data such as the revised second-quarter gross national product report due Thursday. Many analysts and economists expect the GNP growth rate to be revised upward from the 3.1% originally reported. This, traders and economists agreed yesterday, would make dollars still more attractive to investors in the U.S. and abroad.
