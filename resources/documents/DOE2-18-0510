The techniqueallows detection of very low levels of iodinated contrast media suchas those that occur in the arterial system following an intravenous injectionof contrast. The X-ray imaging system used is a standard-image intensifiedfluoroscopy system with a wide dynamic-range TV camera. The video signalfrom the image intensifier is logarithmically enhanced and digitizedon an image processor (computer). This signal, which is stored in oneof two memories, serves as a mask. The mask is subtracted from digitalimages obtained after the injection of contrast media, and the subtractionimages are stored on digital or analog disks or on magnetic tapes. Postprocedurereprocessing allows selection of different masks for subtraction, whichis useful when patient motion has occurred. Hard copies can be obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
