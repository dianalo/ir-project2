The report this past Friday matched a jump in January andtranslated into an annual wholesale inflation rate exceeding 12percent, more than triple the level of last year.   It incited one of the biggest setbacks of the year for the stockand bond markets, where prices tumbled on fear that inflation iseroding the value of these investments and will require a stiffcurative dose of higher interest rates orchestrated by the FederalReserve, the nation's central bank.   The prospect of sharply tighter credit, in turn, signaled a rangeof potential consequences that included higher mortgage rates, moreloan defaults and rising unemployment _ possible elements of arecession.   ``If you hold debt that's based on an adjustrable rate, it willraise your monthly expenses,'' said Michael Moran, a strategist atDaiwa Securities America in New York. ``As for big ticket items likehousing, the higher cost of credit will slow demand for thesethings.''   On a broader scale, the higher cost of borrowing could derail theBush administration's plan for reducing the national debt and budgetdeficit, which is largely based on economic growth and no taxincreases.   Rising rates also could intensify problems faced by hundreds ofsickly thrifts by driving up their own business expenses and thecost of a federal bailout program already estimated at more than$100 billion.   The wholesale inflation number deeply disturbed economists notonly because it exceeded expectations but affected every major area,from clothing to food to energy expenses.   ``The sense here is that the acceleration in inflation has beensteady, and the forces keeping inflation going are still in place,''Brusca said. ``Everything that's going on here is negative.''   In other business and economic developments this past week:   _Inflation fears were further aggravated by rising oil prices,which surged to the highest level in nearly two years. As of Friday,April contracts for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude cost$20.33 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   _Despite the inflation news, other government figures indicatedthe economy is slowing down. For February, industrial outputremained largely unchanged; factory use fell to 84.3 percent from84.5 percent a month earlier; housing starts fell 11.4 percent;retail sales fell 0.4 percent; imports and exports declined inJanuary.   _New twists complicated a bitter strike at Eastern Airlines, withno sign of resolution. In bankruptcy proceedings, pilots andmachinists accused management of deliberate negligence and sought acourt-appointed trustee to run the airline. Management won anemergency court order directing other carriers to honor pre-strikebusiness agreements. Union officials talked of a possibleemployee-led buyout.   _RJR Nabisco Inc., target of the biggest successful takeover inhistory, got a new chief, Louis Gerstner, a former American ExpressCo. executive. On a smaller scale, a partnership including actor TimMatheson, who portrayed a sophomoric philanderer in ``AnimalHouse,'' acquired control of the company that produced the hit film,National Lampoon Inc.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv weekend editions March 18-19</NOTE></DOC>
