The agreement reached early Wednesday with Michigan Bell endedthe walkout that began Aug. 13. Several hours later, members of theCommunications Workers of America workers began returning to jobsthere and at the Bell subsidiaries in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio andWisconsin.   ``We want to show Ameritech that we not only go on striketogether, but we will come back together,'' said Robert Johnson,vice president for CWA District 4, in a statement released by hisoffice in Cleveland.   While the five Bell companies negotiated separately with unionlocals, the workers held off returning to work until all fivereached settlements.   The union is ``encouraged by the fact that we were able toachieve settlements that we can recommend to the membership,''Johnson said.   ``I think both the union and management will be glad to leave thejobs they've been doing right now,'' said Bill Vidmar, spokesman forCWA Local 4340 in Cleveland.   Ratification votes are expected to take place within 30 days,said Greg Kenefick, a union spokesman in Washington.   A spokesman for Chicago-based Ameritech said operations wouldbegin returning to normal almost immediately, although both sidessaid it might take a day or two for all employees to report back towork.   The number of CWA workers and the jobs they handle range widelyamong the companies, from Michigan Bell's 12,800 employees _including operators, phone installers, repair workers and servicerepresentatives _ to Illinois Bell's 2,900 union members, almost allof them operators.   Illinois Bell agreed to a tentative contract with strikersMonday, after weekend agreements at Ohio Bell and Wisconsin Bell.   Indiana Bell and the CWA announced a tentative agreement lateTuesday.   Ameritech Services, a subsidiary that provides planning andcoordination for the Bell subsidiaries, also settled with about 580CWA workers over the weekend.   All contracts are for three years, but details of the pacts werenot available in all cases, pending meetings with leaders of theCWA's 150 locals, Kenefick said.   Each calls for a base wage increase of 9 percent to 10 percentover three years, he said.   Meanwhile, in Rye Brook, N.Y., striking telephone workers and theNYNEX Corp. met Wednesday for their first negotiations in two weeks.   The company's 60,000 workers walked off the job three weeks ago.NYNEX, which like Ameritech is a ``Baby Bell'' created five yearsago by the breakup of ATandamp;T, serves most of New York state and NewEngland.   ``There was no major progress, but it's encouraging that thetalks didn't break off,'' said Bob Master, a spokesman for theCommunication Workers of America, one of two striking unions.   Since the 40,000 members of the CWA and 20,000 members of theInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers took to the picketline on Aug. 6, the company and the union have met only twice.   NYNEX is the only ``Baby Bell'' that has not reached a settlementwith its unions.   Bell Atlantic workers in six states and Washington, D.C., endedtheir strike Monday after agreements were reached withCommunications Workers of America locals in Pennsylvania andDelaware. A tentative contract settlement also has been reached atPacific Telesis, which serves California and Nevada.</TEXT></DOC>
