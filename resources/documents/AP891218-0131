Of all thefinalists, he seemed to be the absolute best in the country,''Mayor-elect David Dinkins said at a news conference to announce hischoice to run America's biggest police force.   Brown, chief in Houston since 1982 and one of four finalists forthe New York job, takes over Jan. 22. He will head a departmentwith 26,000 officers and 7,200 civilian employees, seven timeslarger than Houston's.   ``I made a difficult decision, something I didn't feel I wouldbe making when I was first talked to,'' Brown, 52, said at a newsconference Monday in Houston. ``I talked about it and pondered,agonized and prayed.''   Brown was Houston's first black police chief, and has beencredited for easing racial friction there. But Houston's forcerecently has been hit with allegations of racism and corruption, aswell as controversy over shootings by officers.   As New York's 36th police commissioner, Brown will face a cityconvulsed with drug-related crime. The murder rate is at a recordlevel, and crack cocaine has been the main cause.   ``The thing that will hit him immediately is the drug-crimeproblem,'' said Thomas Reppetto, head of the independent watchdogCitizens Crime Commission and a member of the search committee thatinterviewed Brown.   Brown has said that each city's crime solutions are different,but he is a champion of community policing, with close cooperationbetween police and neighborhoods, Reppetto said.   Before taking the Houston job, Brown was chief of public safetyand chief of public safety for metropolitan Portland, Ore. He holdsa doctorate in criminology from the University of California atBerkeley and is first vice president of the InternationalAssociation of Chiefs of Police.   Brown will become president of the association next year, saidReppetto. ``That's like an open door to the White House'' as anexpert on police affairs, Reppetto said.   Brown began his career as a policeman in San Jose, Calif., in1960. He established Portland State University's criminal justiceprogram eight years later and in 1972 joined Howard University,where he was associate director of the Institute for Urban Affairsand Research and director of the Criminal Justice Program. He wentto Portland in 1975.   Brown succeeds Commissioner Richard Condon, who took over Oct.22 when longtime Commissioner Benjamin Ward retired. Ward was NewYork's first black police commissioner.   Condon was one of the four finalists, and both Gov. Mario Cuomoand outgoing Mayor Edward I. Koch had urged Dinkins to keep Condonon. But Dinkins, who takes office Jan. 1, said he was swayed by thestrong support Brown received from law enforcement experts.</TEXT></DOC>
