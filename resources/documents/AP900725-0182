Actor Paul Burke, former assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Fanningand New Orleans businessman Wilson Abraham also were acquitted ofall charges.   All three were charged with racketeering by conducting anillegal gambling enterprise and aiding and abetting a gamblingoperation. Burke also was charged with perjury.   The accused bookmaker, Walton Aucoin, and two of his employees,Steve Bertolino and William Condon, were convicted on two countseach of gambling and racketeering.   Connick, the father of Grammy-winning jazz musician HarryConnick Jr, sat quietly, rubbed his teary eyes and folded his handsafter the verdict was announced. Several supporters cried, as didone juror.   ``I feel fine,'' Connick told reporters outside the courthouse.   ``There were no thoughts going through my mind, just feelings,''said Burke, star of TV's ``The Naked City.'' ``It was like Romancandles going off...I just thank God we have a court system.''   Even before the federal jury returned its innocent verdict,Connick confidently filed qualifying papers Wednesday for a fallelection.   ``I'm ready to campaign,'' Connick said. ``We've been at this along time and I'm ready for this to be over.''   The U.S. District Court trial lasted six weeks.   The indictment alleged that Connick responded to the urgings ofBurke, Fanning and Abraham and illegally returned seized records toAucoin so the admitted bookie could pay off and collect gamblingdebts. Aucoin, Bertolino and Condon were accused of running anillegal gambling operation.   Connick maintained that Aucoin was entitled to have his gamblingrecords returned under state law. Aucoin said he needed them to payfederal income taxes.   Prosecutors said those were merely excuses cooked up by Fanning,Burke and Abraham to help Connick justify the return of the records.   The perjury charge against Burke stemmed from testimony he gavebefore a grand jury.   James Cole, of the Justice Department in Washington, said thetiming of the return _ just five days after Aucoin was arrested onDec. 4, 1988 _ was the key to the case. Prosecutors said it wouldordinarily take four to six weeks for the records to be returned.   The indictment was handed up in December after a year-longinvestigation begun by U.S. Attorney John Volz.   Connick and Volz had sparred for years over various issues andVolz later turned the case over to the Justice Department to avoidany appearance of bias.   However, Connick always characterized the charges as part of apolitical vendetta, which Cole denied.   ``I think the evidence that we had warranted the bringing of thecase,'' Cole said. ``The decision to bring this case was made bythe public integrity section of the Department of Justice .. TheU.S. Attorney's office had no part in the decision of whether ornot to prosecute this case.''   Fanning, once an assistant to Volz, was Aucoin's lawyer at thetime of the 1988 arrest. Burke was an acquaintance of Connick andAucoin, as was Abraham, a contributor to Connick's politicalcampaigns.   Connick, 63, has been district attorney since 1974.   The investigation also involved former Gov. Edwin Edwards and asuburban sheriff, Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish, although neitherman was indicted.   Lee testified in the trial that he once returned gamblingrecords to Aucoin after an arrest and Edwards was widely reportedto have called Lee on Aucoin's behalf to urge return of thoserecords.</TEXT></DOC>
