That's because in recent weeks, the spread between money-fund yields and what bank money market accounts are offering has become the widest in almost six years.    Mutual funds almost always pay more than do banks on their money market accounts. But the gap now is particularly wide. And with many economists expecting interest rates to rise, money-market investments look more attractive to some experts than the higher, but locked-in, rates on long-term bank certificates of deposit.    Money-market funds &quot;don't force an investor to guess which way interest rates are headed,&quot; says Michael Hirsch, senior vice president and chief investment officer of Republic National Bank in New York. &quot;For the average man on the street, that's an exercise in futility.&quot;    The top money-market mutual funds yielded more than 7% on money left in the fund during the past 12 months and their current seven-day compounded yield is more than 8%, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. The average seven-day compounded yield is 7.71%. (Compound yields represent what an investor would earn in a money fund if the rate continued for a year and dividends were reinvested.)    Meanwhile, bank money market accounts are yielding an average 6.02%, for the widest spread since shortly after these bank accounts were created in December 1982, according to Robert Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla., newsletter. Banks &quot;pay what they need to pay and no more,&quot; Mr. Heady says. &quot;They're apparently satisfied that they're attracting a sufficient amount of retail deposits.&quot;    Many investors are content to leave their money in the bank, attracted by federal insurance for deposits up to $100,000, convenience, and privileges such as free checking that come with sizable deposits. Assets of bank and thrift money market accounts, as of June 30, were down less than 4% since the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash, while CDs of as much as $100,000 were up about 11%.    Twelve-month CDs yield about 8%. But the interest rate is locked in until maturity -- at a time when many people expect rates to rise. And there are penalties for early withdrawal. (Mutual fund and bank money-market accounts generally permit check-writing, though the number or amount of the checks may be restricted.)    Like other mutual funds, a money fund is a pool of investors' money, managed by professionals. But unlike other mutual funds, a money fund's net asset value doesn't vary, but remains at $1 a share. It's the yield that varies. Money funds all make similar investments: in Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and the like.    How to choose among more than 500 funds? &quot;Pick the highest yield; they're all safe,&quot; says William E. Donoghue, chairman of the Donoghue Organization, publisher of Money Fund Report. But among general-purpose, or taxable funds, for example, 12-month yields range from a low of 6% to a high of 7.23%.    To achieve a higher yield, Vanguard Group's Money Market Reserve Fund tries to identify good regional banks that offer higher-than-average yields on CDs and other obligations, says Ian McKinnon, senior vice president of Vanguard Group Inc. &quot;They don't have the Third World debt and oil-patch loans&quot; of some of the big banks, he adds.    Calvert Asset Management's Tax-Free Reserves Fund, one of the highest yielding tax-free funds on a 12-month basis, has about 45% of its assets invested in non-rated securities, which also provide higher yields. But almost all those securities have guaranteed investment contracts or other so-called credit enhancements to minimize risk. &quot;I don't have any worry about the credit risk,&quot; says Reno Martini, portfolio manager.    The highest yielding funds tend to have the lowest costs. Vanguard's fee is 30 basis points, or three-tenths of 1%, of fund assets, compared with an industry average of 70 basis points.    Management of three of the five highest yielding general purpose funds, as ranked by the Donoghue Organization, absorb a portion of fund expenses. Flex-Fund reviews its fee on a weekly basis and lowers it if the fund's yield falls below the top 10 yielding funds. The fee is now just 40 basis points. &quot;We have a long-term approach,&quot; says Robert Meeder Jr., vice president of R. Meeder andamp; Associates, Flex-Fund's parent. &quot;If we are able to attract more capital into the fund, we can make a lot of money.&quot;    Average maturity of money funds is one way of determining where professional money managers think interest rates are heading. They stick with short maturities if they think rates are going up. The current average -- 34 days -- is near a six-year low. Six months ago, the average maturity was 40 days. It was 47 days prior to last October's crash. Maturities for Calvert's tax-free fund have been as long as 80 to 90 days in the past. &quot;Volatility (of interest rates) is so dramatic now,&quot; says Mr. Martini, adding: &quot;You don't want to stick your neck out too far.&quot;    But some fund managers think interest rates have peaked for a while. Flex-Fund's average maturity is up from about 12 days six weeks ago.    Assets of the funds are starting to edge upward again after reaching a post-crash low in June. Since last October's stock market crash, assets have risen about 9%. In the week following the crash, alone, $10 billion moved into money funds.    &quot;There's a foreboding sense among investors that the stock market may be more of a casino game than previously thought,&quot; says Vanguard Group's Mr. McKinnon. And Grace Weinstein, author of &quot;The Lifetime Book of Money Management&quot; says: &quot;People are running scared. They're looking for safe ways of staying liquid and still getting a reasonable rate of return.&quot;    While money funds are attracting investors, the mutual-fund industry in general is hurting. Overall sales of mutual funds for the first eight months of 1988 are down 60% from the year earlier. Assets of funds that invest in stocks are down 23%.    Meanwhile, the assets of Vanguard's Prime fund have almost doubled in the past year to nearly $6 billion, making it the largest money fund. Flex-Fund's assets have risen more than 25% to more than $100 million.    ---                Ranking the Money Market Funds*                                      AVERAGE                                      MATURITY    7-DAY COMPOUND        MINIMUM   AS OF 9/27/88  TELEPHONE  YIELD AS OF 9/27/88**  INVESTMENT   (in days)     NUMBER       Highest yielding general purpose (taxable) funds Alger Money Market Portfolio***     8.40%                $1,000        28      800-992-3863 Vanguard Prime     8.30                  1,000        42      800-622-7447 Flex-Fund***     8.29                  2,500        39      800-325-3539 Market Master***     8.26                  1,000        24      800-441-7379 Monitor Money Market Fund     8.25                  1,000        35      203-855-2246                 Highest yielding tax-free funds Dreyfus N.J.
