Structural isomorphismof the title compound with the hexagonal ferrite BaFe{sub 12}O{sub 19}has been demonstrated. In particular, it is corroborated that the bipyramidalFe ions have a fast diffusional motion within a quasiharmonic double-wellpotential as in BaFe{sub 12}O{sub 19}. Some structural differences withinthe R-block are found among Ba and Sr magnetoplumbites which may accountfor the different dynamic, magnetic, and crystallochemical behavior ofboth compounds.</TEXT></DOC>
