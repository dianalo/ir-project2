Ms. Esmond, who appeared in such Hollywood films as ``The WhiteCliffs of Dover'' and ``Random Harvest,'' died Saturday at her homeat Wimbledon in southwest London. No cause of death was given.   Ms. Esmond was the daughter of the actor-manager and dramatistHenry Vernon Esmond and his actress wife Eva Moore.   She studied at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and madeher London stage debut in December 1922, playing the role of Nibsin ``Peter Pan.''   In 1925, she played Sorel Bliss in Noel Coward's comedy ``HayFever.''   She met Olivier in June 1928 when she was playing in JohnDrinkwater's ``Bird in Hand'' and he joined the cast.   They went to the United States, where they both made theirBroadway debut in 1929, she in `Bird in Hand'' and Olivier in``Murder on the Second Floor.''   After returning to London, she made her movie debut in the 1930version of ``The Chinese Bungalow'' with the young Anna Neagle.   She married Olivier on July 25, 1930, and the following Januarythey appeared together on Broadway with Coward and GertrudeLawrence in Coward's ``Private Lives.''   In 1932, Ms. Esmond appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's movie ``TheSkin Game'' and went on to appear many times on screen. At thisstage in her career, she was a far bigger star than Olivier.   Many audiences felt that with her strong, proud features anddark, heavy eyes she was best suited to stern roles rather thancomedy.   At the end of 1935, she became pregnant. But on the very nightshe and Olivier were celebrating this, he met actress Vivien Leigh,who was later to become his second wife.   In 1937, Ms. Esmond played Olivia to Olivier's Sir Toby Belch inShakespeare's ``Twelfth Night'' at London's Old Vic theater. But bythen their marriage had broken down under the strain of herhusband's infatuation with Ms. Leigh and they were divorced in 1940.   Olivier married Ms. Leigh the following year. That marriageended in divorce in 1961. Olivier, whose third wife was actressJoan Plowright, died on July 11 last year at age 82.   He became Lord Olivier when he was made a peer in 1970.   In 1942, Ms. Esmond returned to Broadway in ``The Morning Star''and appeared in a series of Hollywood films. In 1946, she returnedto Britain, where she resumed her movie career.   She made her last London stage appearance in ``Party Manners''in 1950, and her movie career ended in 1955.   The son of Ms. Esmond and Olivier, Tarquin, was born in 1936.Ms. Esmond never remarried.</TEXT></DOC>
