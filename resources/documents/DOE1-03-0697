One of the major activities is to develop and carry out comprehensivemeasures for safety improvement. Investigations and opinion surveys willbe performed, and safety examinations by administrative agencies willbe reviewed by a special committee to consolidate the nuclear safetyadministration. Safety studies will be carried out in the field of engineering,environment and radioactive waste. For the promotion of nuclear powergeneration, efforts will be conducted to allow it to take root over thecountry, while active publicity work and promotion work are carried out.For the establishment of nuclear fuel cycle, it is necessary to secureuranium resources and concentrated uranium, carry out research and developmentwork for reprocessing of spent fuel and utilization of plutonium andrecovered uranium, and perform safety demonstration tests for treatmentand disposal of radioactive waste. Other activities to be performed in1987 include development of power reactors, research on nuclear fusion,research and development of nuclear ships, promotion of radiation utilization,strengthening of the basis for development and utilization of nuclearpower, and promotion of international cooperation. The approapriationsfor fiscal 1986 and budgets claimed for the above activities for 1987are listed in the last part of this report. (Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
