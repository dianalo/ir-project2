Hoylake said it will appeal the denial of its motion for a preliminary injunction. In a separate action in Kansas on Friday, insurance regulators there denied Hoylake's request to be exempted from the regulatory review process.    The two blows come as Sir James is scrambling in London to get an extension of the Oct. 7 deadline by which he must complete the acquisition of B.A.T under British takeover rules. He has blamed the U.S. insurance regulatory process for the delays, and he has said that without the extension, his takeover bid will fail. Britain's Takeover Panel is expected to rule this week on his request for an extension.    Washington and Kansas are among nine states where Farmers has insurance operations. Sir James's group has filed federal lawsuits in all nine states to try to block the insurance regulators in those states from reviewing his takeover bid for B.A.T, a London-based tobacco, retailing, paper and financial-services concern. A Texas judge last month denied Sir James's request for a preliminary injunction to block the review there.    In London, a B.A.T spokesman said the Tacoma, Wash., and Texas decisions demonstrate &quot;that Hoylake's constitutional challenge is a failing tactic.&quot; The Hoylake lawsuits are challenging the insurance regulators' authority on constitutional grounds.    Sir James has reached an agreement to sell Farmers -- if he is successful in acquiring B.A.T -- to France's Axa Midi Assurances for $4.5 billion. The agreement is designed to win the approval of the insurance regulators. Hearings on Hoylake's and Axa Midi's requests to acquire B.A.T and Farmers have been set by regulators in three states: In Idaho on Oct. 3, in Washington on Oct. 10, and in Oregon on Oct 18.    The Takeover Panel meeting, set for Wednesday, takes on added importance because it doesn't appear likely that Britain's Office of Fair Trading will recommend that the Hoylake bid be referred for a full study by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. A referral to the commission would result in a multimonth study that automatically would dissolve the Hoylake bid.    The Office of Fair Trading is expected to announce its decision today or tomorrow regarding a referral.    &quot;We aren't particularly hopeful that we'll get an MMC referral, but we really don't need a referral to defeat the bid,&quot; the B.A.T spokesman said.    The Office of Fair Trading automatically reviews all bids over a certain size for antitrust and other public-policy implications. Although antitrust grounds weren't present in this case, B.A.T had sought to make an issue of the bid's highly leveraged nature.    However, John Redwood, British minister for corporate affairs, reiterated in an interview with The Times of London over the weekend the government's policy that a leveraged bid isn't, itself, sufficient cause for a study by the MMC. </TEXT></DOC>
