The Federal Reserve's surprise hike in its key discount ratethis past Tuesday caught the bond market off-guard and wreakedhavoc on the three auctions of Treasury securities that followedthe move, analysts said.   The government bonds were not well bid. Many foreign investors,who play a critical role in financing the nation's $2.5 trilliondebt, apparently were driven away from the sales.   ``The Fed really threw the market a curve ball _ and did it atthe last minute,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist and seniorvice president of the fixed-income division at Nikko Securities Co.International Inc.   He likened the impact of the discount-rate boost on the auctionsto ``what Godzilla did to Tokyo.''   The increase in the discount rate, the interest the Fed chargeson loans to major financial institutions, was the first such hikesince last October's stock market crash. A rise in interest ratessends bond prices lower.   The central bank raised the rate a half-percentage point, to 6.5percent, in order to stem inflationary pressure on the economy.Many market watchers had expected the Fed to tighten its reins onthe money supply _ but few were anticipating that dramatic a move.   Consumers felt the ripples two days later, on Thursday, when thenation's major banks responded by upping their prime lending ratesto 10 percent from 9.5 percent. The prime rate is used as abenchmark for a range of loan charges for consumers and businesses,such as home mortgage rates and credit card interest fees.   Bond investors, meanwhile, were feeling shock waves. The threeauctions, on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, made up theTreasury's third-quarter refunding aimed at raising cash to financethe federal debt. The government sold a total $29 billion in 3-yearnotes, 10-year notes and short-term cash management bills.   The discount-rate move and the economic uncertainty it stirredup couldn't have come at a worse time, analysts contend.   The auction results ``were pretty dismal,'' said ElizabethReiners, a vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``The demandthat everybody had thought was out there pretty much dried up atthe auctions.''   The government issues fetched low prices, driving up interestrates on the bonds to sky-high levels.   Yields on the $11 billion in 3-year Treasury notes on theauction block climbed to the highest level in three years. Theaverage yield was 8.77 percent, up sharply from 8.23 percent at thelast comparable auction on May 10.   Another $11 billion in 10-year notes didn't fare much better.Their average yield rose to 9.27 percent, up from 9.06 percent atthe last similar sale on May 11 and the loftiest level in nearlythree years.   Foreign investors _ especially the usually bond-hungry Japanese_ seem to have stayed away from the auctions in droves.   ``They stayed home,'' said Ward McCarthy, chief financialeconomist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.   The 50 percent or so participation by foreign investors thatusually marks the quarterly auctions shrunk in half, traders said.   Compounding the problem was the absence of 30-year Treasurybonds, normally a staple of the quarterly sales and a favorite ofJapanese investors.   Since the Treasury has used up almost all its congressionalauthority to issue long-term securities, it was forced to strike30-year bonds from the slate of the auctions.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Aug. 13-14</NOTE></DOC>
