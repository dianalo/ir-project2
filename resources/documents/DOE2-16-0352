This suggests thenecessity of conducting a periodic insulation diagnosis on generatorsoperating under severe conditions such as DSS (daily start stop) operation.It has also been made clear that the annual decrease ratio A (average)of the Vr of mica-resin insulated windings was 1-3 %, there was no greatdifference from the A=2.5 % of asphalt-compound insulated windings. Newdevices for measuring insulation characteristics have been developedand put into practical use by utilizing recent advances in electronicsand computor processing technology. For the future, expectations arebeing placed on shortening the measurement time, improving the accuracyof insulation diagnosis and the safety of measurement, etc. (29 figs,9 tabs, 26 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
