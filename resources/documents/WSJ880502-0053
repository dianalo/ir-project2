Announcement of the product, expected today, marks a significant strategic change for the Minneapolis-based company, which until now has concentrated on connecting large, high-speed computer systems.    Linking computer networks is becoming increasingly common. But typically such networks involve machines with diverse performance levels, languages and operating systems, so that moving data from one network to another has been difficult.    Initial models of the product, called HYPERchannel-DX, range in price from $35,000 to $100,000. Primary users are expected to be corporations, government agencies and universities. </TEXT></DOC>
