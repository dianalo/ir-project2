But total paystill climbs.   Top managers at 125 industrial corporations saw bonusespaid at the beginning of this year for 1989 performancesdecline 2.4% from the year before, to an average $165,200,consultant Hay Group says. The executives, even so, still aregoing to end up this year with $518,300 in total cashcompensation, a 4.4% rise from 1989, because their basesalaries this year are up 7.8%, to an average $353,100.That's an increase that sounds caution signals for Ira Kay,Hay's director of compensation consulting.</LP><TEXT>   Shareholder interests might be better served by puttingsome of the money used to fund base-pay increases into&quot;long-term-incentive opportunities,&quot; such as stock options,he says. This year's 4.4% increase in total compensation,though, is the slimmest for the top executives since 1985,when their cash packages edged up less than 3%. Last year,with whopping bonuses, total compensation climbed 9.7% from1988.   Midlevel executives see even smaller raises than theirbosses: 5% in base pay and 4.3% in total compensation.                                                                                                          EMPLOYEE-BENEFIT COSTS rose 5.9% in past year, paced byhealth insurance.   Private employers paid for each worker an average of $4.13an hour in March for employee benefits, atop the $10.84 anhour paid in wages, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says. Thebenefits -- including vacations, supplemental pay, allinsurance, retirement plans and Social Security -- came to27.6% of total compensation, up from 27.3% in March 1989 and26.8% in March 1987.   Insurance, which mostly means health coverage, accountedfor much of the rise. Companies paid on average 92 cents anhour to cover workers, up 8.2% from the year before and upnearly 28% from 1987. Social Security posted the secondsharpest rise, costing employers 89 cents for each hourworked, up 19% from 1987.                                                                                                          COMPANIES TARGET catastrophic illnesses in bid to curbsoaring health cost.   With evidence mounting that only a few cases account for ahuge slice of employer medical-benefits bills, companies seekto control costs by looking for ways to head off catastrophesbefore they come to pass. The incentives are clear enough. AUniversity of Michigan study at Steelcase Inc. finds thatonly 10% of its employees account for 66% of its health-carebill. Another Midwest manufacturer says 1% of its workers areresponsible for 20% of its cost.   At International Paper Corp., where seven claims in a9,000-member union group topped $200,000 each last year, thecompany moves to limit exposure caused by life-styleexcesses, with extra charges or increased deductibles forworkers who smoke, are overweight, don't wear seatbelts ordrive while intoxicated. Philip Morris Cos. steers workers tostaff doctors. Quaker Oats Co. runs wellness and prenatalclasses.   General Mills figures each program dollar returns $3 inreduced absenteeism and lower health-care bills.                                                                                                          SEN. DAVID PRYOR's proposed Employee BenefitsSimplification Act draws some shrugs. The bill redefinescompensation and rewrites rules covering distributions intoIRAs. But the measure &quot;doesn't go far enough,&quot; says PhilipBosco of CPAs Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.                                                                                                          WORKERS WORRY MORE about dependents. One in four calls toManaged Health Network deals with emotional problems ofsubscriber spouses and children, up from only one in 20 twoyears ago.                                                                                                          THEY'RE ALL TIED. Workers who smoke and don't wearseatbelts are willing to be paid less than others for jobrisks, Joni Hersch of the University of Wisconsin and W. KipViscusi of Duke conclude.                                                                                                          WRONG TARGET? Half the manufacturers that say they haveproductivity problems trace the difficulty to &quot;people,&quot; CPAsGrant Thornton says. But 38% list plant investments as theirprimary response. Only 24% cite investments in people.                                                                                                          FORGET SPECIALIZING. Getting ahead now requires&quot;generalist&quot; training.   Students believe it; a survey by consultant RightAssociates finds that college students say more than 2 to 1that the route to the top requires skills in many areasrather than in-depth training in one specialized field. And,for once, their elders agree. &quot;Pick something you can put110% into,&quot; even if it has nothing to do with your careerplan, advises Karen Horn, chief executive of Bank One. &quot;Theability to put 110% into something is very valued in thebusiness world,&quot; she explains.   At Chevron USA, says Willis Price, president, &quot;we'removing from technical expertise and scholastic excellence toa broader profile.&quot; Albert Ondis, Astro-Med Inc.'s CEO, saystoday's students must develop skills that can be &quot;recycled&quot;as careers change. Team Bank Chairman Ronald Steinhart, withdegrees in accounting and finance, urges liberal-arts courseson his three sons. Leonard Jaskol, CEO of Lydall Inc.,suggests training in logic.   But Gene Bell of Pacific Telesis argues &quot;you've got tounderstand technology, no matter what job you have.&quot;                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: Sometimes it takes an earthquake. Only onein five companies nationally has a formal policy for helpingworkers cope with natural disasters. But half the West Coastfirms have or are considering such a plan, Adia PersonnelServices says. . . . We know, we know. National Seminars'list of difficult people includes &quot;the know-it-all,&quot; &quot;thefake know-it-all,&quot; &quot;the bull,&quot; &quot;the whiner&quot; and &quot;the fox.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          JONI HERSCH is on the faculty of the University ofWyoming.
