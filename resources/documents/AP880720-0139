Applause, whistles and whoopsresound throughout the hall, as the Americans express their highestlevel of approval.   ``One can see that, volume for volume, the Democratic platformis more constructive than the Republicans' in terms of working fora more stable character in the Soviet-American dialogue.''</TEXT><HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD><TEXT>   The Financial Times: (conservative)   ``The... Democratic Party... for the first time in more than aquarter of a century... has begun to present a united front to theAmerican electorate. This gives it a chance, although not aguarantee, of victory in the presidential election. Much of thecredit for creating the party's new-found sense of unity must go tothe Democratic candidate, Mr. Michael Dukakis, whose own reputationis that of being slightly to the left of center _ in American termsa cautious liberal _ on domestic issues, and a more or less unknownquantity on foreign policy.   ``(Dukakis) reached an understanding with the powerful Mr.Jackson...   ``This understanding could, however, eventually damage theparty's chances of victory... The package of policies that he haspushed for is too far to the left for a party that seeks victory.''</TEXT><HEAD>SOUTH AFRICA</HEAD><TEXT>   Radio South Africa: (state-run)   ``In Atlanta, Mr. Dukakis ... is trying to build unanimity atthe party convention to improve his prospects at the polls. Toobtain the support of Mr. Jesse Jackson and his followers, Mr.Dukakis has agreed to label South Africa a terrorist state.   ``...And as a further sop to Mr. Jackson, Mr. Dukakis has agreedto abandon the demand for a Cuban withdrawal from Angola,notwithstanding the fact that even the MPLA (Popular Movement forthe Liberation of Angola) government now agrees on the need for it.   ``Atlanta is a long way from southern Africa, and Mr. Dukakishas had no great difficulty building his cocoon of illusions.''</TEXT><HEAD>ITALY</HEAD><TEXT>   La Repubblica: (liberal)   Claudio Martelli, No. 2 man of Italy's Socialist Party and anobserver at the Atlanta convention, in interview said: ``There isan (identity) crisis common to many progressive parties in theWest, like the British Laborites and the German Social Democrats,that have suffered in these years the offensive of neo-conservativeforces.   ``The U.S. Democrats don't want to be cast in obsoletepositions, they are aiming to recover the center of the electorate,and activate the enthusiasm of their traditional base.''   La Stampa: (moderate)   ```Governing from the center' is the message that the possibleprotagonists of the Third Chapter of the American political sceneseem to want to present in Atlanta, certain that the public willjoin around this flag.   ``It is a possible project but not an easy one. It is thus thatthe Atlanta Convention appears so `unheroic,' so difficult torelate to as a great event. Yet, if it does not go badly, if therewill not be the drama of a tragic separation between white andblack, a new definition of `making politics' could start here, inthese days, and not only for America.''</TEXT><HEAD>NORWAY</HEAD><TEXT>   Dagbladet: (independent)   The daily said in an editorial Wednesday that the most importantthing about the nomination of Michael Dukakis is that Jesse Jacksonis on the Democratic Party team.   ``The white voters in the southern states are... no longer tiedto the Democratic Party. So it would not be enough for Dukakis tohave (Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd) Bentsen at hisside. He is dependent on Jackson in order to beat (Vice PresidentGeorge) Bush.''</TEXT></DOC>
