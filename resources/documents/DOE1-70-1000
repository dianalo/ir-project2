Cell survival curves were measuredfor bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells. In order to explain the observedcurves, a program calculating energy fluctuations in sensitive microvolumeswas developed. The program of biological investigations in JINR, Dubna,is substantially extended now. Beside lethal effects the mutagenic actionof various types of ionising beams is studied. A new mighty acceleratorhas been reconstructed. It is a synchrocyclotron with the maximum outputof about 50 {mu}A of 60 MeV protons. The machine gives proton, neutronand negative pion beams for clinical purposes. There is an extensivebiological program on the accelerator including investigation of lethal,mutagenic and carcinogenic effects.</TEXT></DOC>
