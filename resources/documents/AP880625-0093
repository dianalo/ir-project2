CRAFT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson took steps today to avoid acontentious debate over Democratic Party rules, as party officialsmet to draft a platform that Dukakis will stand on in the fall.   The two Democratic presidential rivals reached an agreement toeliminate beginning in 1992 provisions that Jackson said preventedhim from getting as many delegates as he deserved, according toDukakis spokesman, Tad Devine.   The new rules, being worked on by party officials in Washington,are now virtually assured of ratification by the party's nationalconvention in Atlanta next month. They would cut the number ofsuper delegates by nearly half, and require that all otherdelegates in all other states be awarded in proportion to votesthey receive.   Meanwhile, in Denver, the party's platform panel is taking up apreliminary draft document pledging that Democrats would ``restorecompetence, caring and incorruptibility to the federal executivebranch and get it working again fairly for all Americans.''   Dukakis was vacationing today in Massachusetts. On Friday, hesaid Bill Bradley appears uninterested in being the one to run forthe No. 2 spot on the ticket. And he was attacked by RepublicanGeorge Bush, who said, ``we don't need more taxes, we need apresident who can hold the line against congressionaloverspending.''   Jackson, who was in Puerto Rico today, has complained that hisdelegate total this year does not reflect his strength at the polls.   Devine said that the Massachusetts governor would have won thenomination even if those proposed rules were in place this year.   ``The reason that Mike Dukakis is the nominee of the party is hewas the overwhelming choice of the voters,'' said Devine, who is incharge of delegate selection for Dukakis' presidential campaign.   Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas and Christian broadcasterPat Robertson, whipped by Bush in the battle for the delegates whowill pick the Republican presidential nominee in New Orleans inmid-August, praised the vice president at a party unity rallyFriday in Cincinnati.   ``The Republican Party is united and we are not about to see thecountry go for a mediocre liberal like Michael Dukakis,'' saidRobertson. ``I'd accept the nomination but it's already gone,''quipped Dole.   Former Secretary of State Alexander Haig Jr. said today thatBush ``is the candidate of safe change.''   ``God help us if Michael Dukakis wins. He is the candiate ofradical and dangerous change,'' Haig said.   Dukakis said Thursday he supports $115 million in new taxes to``make sure the state's fiscal base is solid and strong,''announcing he would sign a $40 million cigarette levy and favoredraising another $75 million by bringing the state's tax code intoline with federal tax law changes.   In Cincinnati on Friday, Bush attacked Dukakis on the tax issue,saying: ``I will not raise your taxes, period. He just has, in hishome state.'' At a news conference, Bush said Dukakis ``refuses torule out a tax hike for the nation. We know what that means.''   Asked if he would rule out all forms of tax increases, evenexcise taxes, Bush said he would, but would not extend that pledgeto ``user fees'' such as those charged for entering national parks.   Bush said he had a ``plain as day'' difference with Dukakis,``tax cuts vs. tax hikes,'' and added he is not concerned his standwould lock him in if he is elected. ``I think it's reassuring tothe working men and women in this country,'' Bush said.   At the unity rally, Bush said: ``I promise you I'll not raisetaxes as a first, second or last resort. ... We don't need moretaxes, we need a president who can hold the line againstcongressional overspending.''   Back in Massachusetts, Dukakis opened a four-day vacation onNantucket Island and said Friday that it appears Bradley, a senatorfrom New Jersey, isn't interested in joining the Democratic ticketas the vice presidential candidate.   ``We haven't talked personally about it,'' said Dukakis. ``He'ssomebody I have a lot of respect for.'' Dukakis said Bradleyapparently told Paul Brountas, a senior adviser leading Dukakis'search for a vice presidential candidate, that he wasn't interestedin the vice presidential slot.   ``I respect that,'' Dukakis said.   ``In any event, we're going to keep in touch,'' he added.   Dukakis also said that Jackson, reported by The Boston Globe tohave said privately he would turn down the vice presidentialnomination, had not sent any such word to the Dukakis campaign and``I don't know anything about'' that published report.   In San Juan, Puerto Rico, Jackson denied on Friday he had toldaides he would reject the vice presidential spot on the Dukakisticket. Asked about the report quoting unidentified aides as sayinghe would turn it down, Jackson responded: ``No, absolutely not.Therefore, whoever was talking was not authorized, but also was notdealing in the truth.''   Said Jackson: ``The matter of the vice presidency is a seriousmatter. The destiny of our nation, perhaps the rest of the world,rests on the campaign in July and in November. To that extent,there will be no intrigue about that decision.''   Jackson also said Friday that he has picked up eight of PuertoRico's 57 delegates to the Democratic convention, and his campaignsaid he wants at least 17. Jackson had won a March 20 ``beautycontest'' primary in Puerto Rico but the entire delegation hadvoiced support for Dukakis for the presidential nomination.   In Denver, a 16-member drafting panel unanimously approved apreliminary version of the proposed Democratic platform Friday, inadvance of today's meeting of the 186-member Platform Committee.   Some differences still divided the Dukakis and Jackson camps butcampaign staffs said they were continuing their negotiations.   The preliminary document avoids discussion of higher taxes, afreeze on Pentagon spending or a Palestinian homeland. It urges``more stable defense budgets,'' calls for appointing a drug czar,and says South Africa is a terrorist state. Without mentioningabortion, it endorses ``freedom of reproductive choice.''</TEXT></DOC>
