The maker of baby-food products didn't disclose the amount of the bid. It had announced in April that CWT management had requested 60 days to pursue a buyout of the unit.    Gerber said the bid is subject to CWT management's obtaining financing and certain other conditions. The company said that if its management accepts the bid, the transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter ending Sept. 30.    Gerber also restated its previously reported fourth-quarter results to reflect the planned disposition of the subsidiary. The company said its profit from continuing operations from the quarter ended March 31 was $12.7 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $12.5 million, or 61 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. A loss of $9.7 million from discontinued operations made final net $3.1 million, or 16 cents a share. Sales in the quarter were $261.4 million, compared with $210.7 million.    It said it took a $7.9 million charge resulting primarily from taxes on the expected disposition for fiscal 1987. The company said proceeds from the sale would be used for debt reduction and general corporate purposes.    In a leveraged buyout, investors acquire the company with debt that is paid with funds generated by the acquired company. </TEXT></DOC>
