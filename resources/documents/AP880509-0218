A recent rise in the wave of fleeing Vietnamese is largelyresponsible for the new get-tough policies and brings to a boil thelong-simmering problem: what to do with people nobody, includingVietnam itself, seems to want?   Southeast Asians maintain that many Vietnamese are fleeing thesedays not because of political persecution but because ofdeteriorating economic conditions at home.   The solution, some officials believe, might be to send them back.   People found to have fled because of political persecution doqualify for asylum and eventual resettlement elsewhere.   Since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, neighboring nationshave offered temporary asylum to fleeing Vietnamese with theunderstanding they would be accepted by the United States, Canada,Britain and other Western countries.   About 600,000 boat people have found new homes since the war,according to United Nations statistics.   But officials in the region now talk of ``compassion fatigue''throughout the world so that resettlement does not keep up with thetide of new boat people entering cramped refugee camps.   ``What we're finding now is that horrifying phrase, `compassionfatigue,' is all too true,'' Sir David Wilson, the governor of HongKong, told a recent news conference. ``Whereas we have a continuousflow of Vietnamese refugees coming here, the resettlement countriesare not prepared to take so many.''   Under that pressure, the policy of offering temporary asylum toall boat people is crumbling in Thailand and Malaysia and beingre-evaluted in the British colony of Hong Kong.   Earlier this year, Thailand pushed back to sea Vietnamese boatsattempting to land, and several deaths were reported. The newpolicy brought sharp international criticism. The Thais backed offand reopened its doors but insisted the new arrivals would nolonger be eligible for resettlement.   Malaysia recently announced it will begin turning away boatpeople at some unspecified future date.   ``Nobody wants to be hard-hearted about the issue, turning awayhelpless people to take their chances again with the elements andpirates, but Malaysia cannot afford to provide indefinite shelterfor thousands of refugees,'' The New Straits Times newspaper ofMalaysia said in a recent editorial.   In Hong Kong, legislators angrily demand the colony no longeroffer asylum, while the government seeks elusive alternatives tothe current policy that will not result in turning away boat peoplein unseaworthy craft.   Vietnamese boat people began appearing in 1975 but not untilfour years later did they turn into a human tide.   Southeast Asian nations agreed on the temporary asylum policy in1979, when more than 200,000 boat people poured out of Vietnam andwere presumed to be fleeing political persecution in theirhomeland, which now was under a Communist regime. The world openedits arms and most of refugees were resettled within a few years.   According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees,Vietnamese boat people arrivals in the region declined annuallyfrom nearly 75,000 in 1981 to about 20,000 in 1986. The number ofrefugees resettled also declined during that period but alwaysexceeded the number of newcomers.   Last year, however, boat people arrivals shot up 30 percent toabout 28,000 while resettlement totals declined slightly to about21,000, the High Commission said.   Some countries reported a sharp increase in arrivals this year.As of May 2, more than 2,400 boat people sailed into Hong Kong,more than five times the total from the same period a year earlier.   About 40,000 boat people were languishing in the region'srefugee camps by the end of March, a 27 percent increase from theyear earlier, according to U.N. statistics. Nearly 34,000 were inThailand, Malaysia and Hong Kong.   Resettlement also was up in the first quarter from the sameperiod last year, but still was not keeping pace with new arrivals,the U.N. statistics showed.   One reason why boat people now receive frosty receptions is thewidely held view that many are fleeing Vietnam not for fear ofpersecution but to improve their economic conditions.   ``Those now coming are not the traditional boat people,'' saidone official in Bangkok, Thailand's capital. ``Most are looking forbetter economic opportunity.''   Many officials in the region believe the only long-term solutionis repatriation for such people.   ``I think everybody would agree that a solution that providesfor repatriation would be the answer,'' said Fazlul Karim, theleading U.N. refugee official in Hong Kong. ``The problem is we donot have any workable solution yet.''   The main hurdle, officials say, lies in getting the Vietnamesegovernment in Hanoi to take its boat people back. So far, they say,Vietnam has agreed on a case-by-case basis to take back the limitednumber of people who had volunteered to return.   Vietnamese officials maintain that boat people are leavingbecause they are disaffected and that there is no point in takingthem back because they wuld only try to leave again because ofVietnam's economic conditions.   While Vietnam says its inability to recover from the war and thepaucity of Western economic help may be responsible for theseconditions, Wilson, the Hong Kong governor, places the blame onHanoi.   ``The government of Vietnam bears a very heavy responsibilityfor the appalling situation in which thousands of people continueto risk their lives at sea to get away,'' he said.   Even if Vietnam were to allow the return of boat people, saysthe U.N. High Commission's Karim, a system would be needed toscreen the economic migrants to be repatriated from genuinepolitical refugees.   The Southeast Asian nations also would have to decide what to doabout the boat people who have received temporary asylum but remainin refugee camps pending resettlement.   The next likely step for the Southeast Asian nations is to seeka long-term regional solution.   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, made up of Thailand,Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines and Singapore, willdiscuss the refugee situation in June at a meeting also to beattended by Hong Kong.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 15</NOTE></DOC>
