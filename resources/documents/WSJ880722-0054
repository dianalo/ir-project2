Several exchanges are competing to start such trading, which must be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The American Stock Exchange this week announced a similar linkup with Standard andamp; Poor's, a unit of New York-based McGraw-Hill Inc., and the New York Stock Exchange is studying ways to launch similar trading.    The Philadelphia instrument would be known as a &quot;Cash Index Participation.&quot; Its price, one-tenth the level of the Sandamp;P index, would currently be about $27. The Philadelphia exchange said its Sandamp;P product is &quot;designed to give individual investors the same opportunity as institutional investors to purchase the equivalent of a portfolio or basket of stocks.&quot; Settlement would be in cash; there wouldn't be any delivery of the underlying stocks.    The Philadelphia exchange said it expects the SEC to act on its proposal in September. Opposition from the Chicago futures exchanges, which dominate trading in stock-index futures, is possible. </TEXT></DOC>
