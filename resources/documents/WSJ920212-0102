Loan demand was weak, the number of borrowers unable tomeet interest payments was rising, and deposit-insurancecosts were skyrocketing. To top it all off, interest rates onnew loans were falling.   Yet banks' profits were strong. The low rates were anopportunity for banks that looked ahead. Andrew Craig,chairman of Boatmen's Bancshares Inc. in St. Louis, says, &quot;Westructured the balance sheet in anticipation of a downturn inrates.&quot;   Unlike industrial corporations, which rely heavily onrising prices to make money, banks and other financialinstitutions can prosper when they charge less for theirservices. That's because the cost of their raw material,money, usually falls faster than the rates they receive ontheir loans and investments. And they can further increasetheir gains by adjusting their strategies to make that happenfaster. The result for Boatmen's: Net income in 1991 rose 11%despite the sluggish economy.   What banks like Boatmen's and others did was lengthenmaturities of interest-earning loans and investments to lockin higher rates. And they reduced maturities of theirdeposits to, in effect, buy money more cheaply. That, afterall, is what financial intermediaries do -- buy money at oneprice and sell it at another.   But now banks need to look ahead again. They are facingincreasing pressure to compete by reducing rates on loansthey make, and they can't keep slashing rates they paydepositors. Even if the Federal Reserve pushes down interestrates further, &quot;there's a point where you can't jam depositrates down any more,&quot; says Christopher Mahoney, a vicepresident of Moody's Investors Service Inc. &quot;You don't wantthe little old lady with a $100,000 passbook account to pullout.&quot;   That prospect is in sharp contrast to most of last year.Through last fall, loan rates held firm while many banks andthrift institutions were reducing the rates they paid oncertificates of deposit. Mr. Craig, for example, acknowledgestaking a &quot;pretty aggressive&quot; attitude toward lowering depositinterest rates.   The embattled thrift industry also benefited, achievingoverall profitability for the first time since 1985, saysMichael Wilson, director of research at the U.S. League ofSavings Institutions. In the third quarter, the net interestmargin -- the spread between interest paid annually andinterest earned annually -- shot up. It jumped 0.55percentage point from a year earlier to 2.40% as the averagerate on interest income slipped to 8.65% from 9.14%, whilethe average rate on interest expense plummeted to 6.25% from7.29%.   The widening interest margins gave lenders more cushion tohandle bad loans. &quot;Some banks took advantage of the fourthquarter, when margins were at their highest levels, to clearthe decks&quot; by increasing reserves, says Brent Erensel, bankanalyst at UBS Securities Inc.   Other banks seized the chance to tap the stock and bondmarkets for new capital. With profits strong, banks raised$8.2 billion in new equity last year, nearly twice as much asin any of the previous four years, according to IDDInformation Services Inc.   But it's going to be tougher in coming months forfinancial institutions to maintain the wider interestmargins. Although the Fed may ease rates further, manyobservers believe that rates are bouncing around the bottomand, sooner or later, will head back up. That's puttingpressure on financial institutions to devise strategies tokeep net interest margins high. &quot;How much risk to take oninterest rates is one of the biggest decisions a bank makes,&quot;says Steven Elliott, chief financial officer of Pittsburgh'sMellon Bank.   Margins will come under pressure as rates rise becausemost banks' liabilities (money borrowed from customers orother banks) are repriced faster than assets (loans andinvestments). In effect, the cost of money goes up but assetsremain on the books at the old, lower rates despite thegeneral increase in interest rates.   Even if rates stay the same or dip slightly, pressure onmargins is building. A surge in mortgage refinancing istaking away returns on which banks and thrifts had counted.And &quot;there's been a sharp reduction in rates on auto,home-equity and a variety of specialized loans, plusaggressive competition on the prime rate,&quot; says RobertDugger, chief economist at the American Bankers Association.The prime, the basic rate for most small-business and someconsumer loans, has fallen faster than the cost of federalfunds, the money banks lend one another.   The difference between consumer deposit and loan rateswidened in the fourth quarter, but more slowly than inprevious quarters. In the five months ended Feb. 5, theannual effective yield of a one-year CD nationwide declined1.67 percentage points to 4.14%, says Bank Rate Monitor, ofNorth Palm Beach, Fla. But personal-loan rates fell only 0.59percentage point to 16.35%, new-car loans 1.25 points to10.32%, and credit-card rates a scant 0.16 point to 18.78%.   Although consumers got the short end of the interest-ratestick, banks didn't rack up big interest-margin gains in thefourth quarter. SNL Securities, a Charlottesville, Va.,statistical-research firm, estimates their margin rose onlyslightly to 4.23% from 4.22% three months earlier. It hadbeen 4.02% in the first quarter; it jumped in the second andthird periods, when banks held the line on loans whilereducing rates on deposits.   The high net interest margin stems partly from anunusually wide gap between short- and long-term rates.Long-term fixed investments are earning a relatively highreturn, which &quot;artificially bloats net interest income,&quot; saysReid Nagle, president of SNL Securities.   The latest rate cut accelerated the outflow of CD funds.Banks had a net outflow of about $3 billion in deposits inthe first four weeks of January, as customers cashed in $24billion of CDs and parked much of it in savings and checkingaccounts, which grew $21 billion, according to the Fed. Lastyear, banks had a net deposit gain of about $80 billion,thanks largely to deposits coming from troubled thrifts. Muchof the $960 billion of CD money will be up for reinvestmentthis year.   Banks with a greater variety of investments to offercustomers can keep the CD money in house. For example,Boatmen's Bancshares offers full brokerage services at somebranches, where its fees are up &quot;substantially,&quot; Mr. Craigsays. Also, with the recent stock-market gains, fees inBoatmen's trust department are up. &quot;We may lose on bananas,but we're making up for it on apples,&quot; he adds.   Even if banks and thrifts could push deposit rates lowerwithout losing customers, their low returns on loans arehurting. &quot;Our costs really get squeezed as rates go lower,&quot;says John McCoy, chairman of Banc One Corp., of Columbus,Ohio. He says the average cost for free checking is $2 permonth per customer. &quot;You make $4 for every $100 of depositswhen base loan rates are at 6%, but only $2 when rates are at4%,&quot; he says. (Many commercial loans are priced off Fedfunds, which currently are around 4%.)   More and more banks, adds John Leonard, a Salomon Brothersanalyst, also wonder whether &quot;they should thin out theirbranch networks.&quot; At present rates and under present economicconditions, they simply do not generate enough business.   Although low rates should encourage corporate borrowing,they're doing the opposite. Not only is loan demand weak, butmany companies are refinancing existing bank debt with cheap,long-term funds from the bond or stock markets.   But there are some encouraging signs. First FidelityBancorp's new loan requests recently have been at leastmatching repayments. &quot;That is a significant change from thesteady decline in loan demand over the previous 12 months,&quot;says Wolf Schoellkopf, vice chairman of the $29 billion NewJersey company. He also notes many corporations' creditquality has improved because their interest costs aredropping.   Banks and thrifts would be much better off if so manymortgages weren't being refinanced. The Mortgage BankersAssociation estimates that $162 billion of mortgages wererefinanced last year, more than twice 1990 and yet nowherenear the $400 billion anticipated for 1992. &quot;The incredibleand unpredictable rate of prepayments is wreaking havoc withprojected cash flow of a lot of institutions,&quot; says JonLeader, president of Liberty Capital Management, afixed-income securities advisory firm.   Banks now are almost as exposed as thrifts to the vagariesof the mortgage market. Since 1988, mortgages andmortgage-related securities have grown at a rate exceeding20% annually, notes Mr. Nagle of SNL Securities. They nowaccount for $682 billion or so of bank assets.   However, mortgage refinancing does increase the no-riskfees earned by many banks and thrifts. Rather than book newmortgages at today's rates, they are selling them into thesecondary market. But they continue to collect the payments,for a fee.   Banks' current strategies fall into two camps, says FredPrice, a partner at Sandler O'Neill andamp; Partners, aninvestment-banking firm for financial institutions. He callsone the &quot;hopeful&quot; camp because such institutions expect ratesto rise relatively soon or aren't sure what will happen. Soinstead of investing deposits longer term to pick up greaterincome, they are keeping their assets liquid for a possiblequick upturn in loan demand. That way they won't have to payup for deposits to fund the loans.   For example, Collective Federal Savings Bank of EggHarbor, N.J., is selling off new fixed-rate mortgages because&quot;we don't want to get trapped into what happened to thriftsin the early 1980s,&quot; says Scott Page, a spokesman. &quot;If we doinvest, it's short-term until we get a better feel for whereinterest rates are going.&quot;   The second camp of institutions is putting money to workfor higher returns now. They are even less sure of a revivalof loan demand, Mr. Price says. Five-year pools of mortgagesecurities are yielding 7.15%, compared with 6.30% forsimilar-dated Treasurys and close to 4% for Fed funds or30-day commercial paper.   &quot;There's a manhunt on for higher-earning assets,&quot; saysJames McDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc.&quot;One of tomorrow's problems will be redeploying assets in alow-yield environment.&quot; Improvements in bank earnings, hebelieves, will have to come from continued cost cutting and areduction in problem loans.   Affecting this quarter's profitability will be the extentto which banks book gains from investments. Many saw theirfixed-income portfolios rise last year, since bond prices goup as interest rates move lower. Most banks are strugglingover whether to take investment gains because of a debateamong regulators over marking bank portfolios to market foraccounting purposes, thus subjecting earnings touncontrollable shifts. &quot;I expect a lot of banks will betaking gains this quarter even though the regulatorsdiscourage it,&quot; says Bert Ely, head of Ely andamp; Co., anAlexandria, Va., consulting firm.   Banks that are taking gains term that a normal part oftheir asset/liability management. NationsBank, the Atlantagiant, raised eyebrows by booking $459 million in securitiesgains last year. But Russell Paige, head of investorrelations, says the sales were part of a plan to reduce theaverage maturity of the portfolio.   &quot;In the deteriorating economy,&quot; he says, &quot;our strategy wasto increase the size of our securities portfolio to between$15 billion and $17 billion and go further out in averagematurity to 6.5 years.&quot; Now the maturity average is down toabout three years because &quot;as the economy improves, we wantour portfolio in pretty liquid position to redeploy thoseassets into commercial and corporate loans.&quot;   KeyCorp, a bank holding company operating in many states,plans to sell some securities and take a gain this quarter.They're now yielding 6% to 7%, and before they lose value asrates rise, &quot;we want to get rid of low-yielding assets so wecan reinvest them at higher levels,&quot; says William Dougherty,executive vice president.   He expects that in the second and third quarters, rateswill edge higher, &quot;eroding interest margins as each quarterticks off.&quot; One way he is protecting his bank's healthy 5%margin is by using interestrate &quot;swaps&quot; to lengthen thematurity of some liabilities.   &quot;You have to be quick and nimble to profit as rates rise,&quot;he adds.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          NATIONSBANK Corp.'s headquarters is in Charlotte, N.C.
