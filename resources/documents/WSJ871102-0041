U.S. households received 56 billion pieces of third-class mail in 1986, a 49% increase from 1982, according to the Postal Service. A new study by the Newspaper Advertising Bureau shows where such mail originates, who is most likely to receive it and where -- perhaps not surprisingly -- most of it ends up.    Forty percent of direct-mail ads come from national advertisers while about 25% come from local advertisers. An additional 20% are for mail-order goods, a category that includes both national and local companies. The remainder come from mass merchandisers such as Sears and J.C. Penney.    The average American household receives an average of 9.3 pieces of direct-mail ads each week -- about 500 pieces a year. But households with incomes of $35,000 or more can expect to get at least 12 pieces a week. The segment most likely to receive direct-mail ads, according to the study, are adults in households with incomes of $35,000 or more who are college graduates, aged 45 to 64, married, and live in the West.    Despite the growing number of direct-mail ads, the odds of such messages generating a response are increasingly slim. Three-fourths of all advertising mail was thrown away in 1986. A similar study done by the Newspaper Advertising Bureau in 1982 found that only 57% of such mail was thrown away. Pieces from mail-order houses and mass merchandisers are the most likely mail to be kept.    National advertisers may want to consider how to make their direct mail more appealing. With increases in third-class postal rates likely and the glut of direct-mail ads also likely to continue, only exceptional messages will get through the increasingly costly clutter.    Customer Service   Businesses that are trying to improve customer service -- but question whether customers will be willing to pay the additional costs -- should find some encouragement in a new study by Cambridge Reports.    About three of five people responding to a survey by the Massachusetts-based research organization said that in choosing a service, cost is less important than having their needs met. Indeed, with the exception of Northeasterners, majorities in all population groups say customer satisfaction is more important than cost when purchasing a service.    When individuals were asked what factor best defines high-quality service, the most frequent response was personal attention. That was followed by, among other things, dependability, promptness and employee competence.    A majority of respondents -- particularly the better-educated and more affluental -- so said the quality of service in business is about as high today as it was a generation ago. Fewer than three in 10 people said service has deteriorated.    But that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement. Only 8% of survey respondents were willing to describe service as &quot;excellent.&quot; Half said it is &quot;good,&quot; while 28% said it is &quot;only fair.&quot; The number who do believe that service is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;excellent&quot; tends to decline with age.    The study suggests that services catering to better-educated, middle-aged individuals can most easily raise prices in order to provide better service.    Automatic Tellers   Given how many Americans would like to see more personal attention in service industries -- which include banks -- it is surprising that 60% of respondents told Cambridge Reports that they think automatic tellers are a good idea.    Two out of every five Americans now claim to have used an automatic teller machine. Of that number, 33% said they like them. Seventy-one percent of people who have used automatic teller said they feel as safe with a machine as with a human teller. Even so, a little more than one-third of respondents said they think banking is made more difficult by the use of automatic tellers.    Consumers seem to still want personal service when they have complicated transactions or have questions about a product. But for rote transactions, automation may be acceptable. Cambridge Reports notes that the trend toward acceptance of automation has taken longer than many experts thought it would. </TEXT></DOC>
