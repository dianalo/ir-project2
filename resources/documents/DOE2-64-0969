Theoreticalmodels indicate that increases in man-made greenhouse gases, such ascarbon dioxide, over decadal and longer time scales, perturbs the equilibriumbetween the two components of the Earth's radiation budget (ERB); i.e.,(1) the heat Earth absorbs form the Sun, and (2) the heat Earth emitsto space. This leads to changes in the global climate. For example, the1983 report to the National Research Council entitled, Changing Climate(NRC, 1983), indicated that a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrationwas likely in the next hundred years. This would cause the Earth to emitless heat than it absorbs which would subsequently increase the globallyaveraged surface air temperature by between 1.5 and 4.5 C. This changewould occur as a result of a small imbalance between the two ERB componentsof less than 1 W/sq m, globally averaged. However, these same modelsindicate that each component would be changed by up to 4 W/sq m, globallyaveraged, with regional changes varying from about 20 W/sq m in the tropicsto as large as 100 W/sq m for absorbed solar radiation at the poles.These large regional changes would be due to the effects of climate feedbackon the ERB components, caused primarily by increased water vapor anddecreased surface snow and ice cover at the poles, both the result ofthe warmer climate. Thus, with a long, uninterrupted time record of stableERB measurements, it would be possible to detect climate change associatedwith increases in trace gas concentrations.</TEXT></DOC>
