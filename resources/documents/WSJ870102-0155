In its annual Industrial Outlook, a detailed analysis of 250 goods-producing industries and more than 130 service-sector industries, the department forecasts that about 70% of U.S. manufacturing industries will record increased shipments.    At a news conference Wednesday, Deputy Commerce Secretary Clarence Brown said the department's most optimistic forecasts estimate that the merchandise trade gap could narrow by as much as $40 billion this year.    The deficit in 1986 is believed to have swelled to as much as $170 billion, and many private economists anticipate less improvement in 1987 than Mr. Brown suggested. In a separate report released yesterday, the department said the nation's merchandise trade deficit expanded to a record $19.22 billion in November.    Mr. Brown said manufactured exports are expected to grow faster than imports for the first time since 1980. The improving trade balance, he said, is due to the dollar's decline against major foreign currencies, U.S. efforts to encourage more-balanced growth and trade-liberalization abroad, and strict enforcement of U.S. trade laws.    Still, the department expects that the service sector will remain the fastest-gaining area. Growth for the whole economy, Mr. Brown said, &quot;will be broader across all industries than in recent years, although somewhat shallower for all.&quot;    The department projects that the economy's growth will pick up from the 2.6% inflation-adjusted rate it estimates for 1986, with the average unemployment rate declining from the 6.9% it estimates for last year.    Growth of the construction industry will slow sharply, to a 1% annual rate from 4.8% in 1986, according to the outlook. Mr. Brown said this will be due partly to the tax-law changes that are expected to hurt the real estate industry.    Auto sales are expected to drop about 10% from the eight million units the department assumed were sold in 1986. Production of crude oil and natural gas is expected to fall 1% next year, with prices remaining &quot;relatively depressed&quot; compared with recent years.    The department expects a 2% rise in the median value of industry shipments next year, after inflation adjustment. Among specific industries, the department expects high-technology concerns to lead the manufacturing sector. Shipments for the semiconductor industry are seen growing 27%. Other fast-growing industries include electronic capacitors, optical devices and lenses, X-ray equipment and missiles and space vehicles.    The manufacturing industry expected to post the sharpest declines in shipments is turbine-generator sets at 62%. Other companies with expected shipment declines are metal-cutting machines, vehicle and car bodies, games and toys and footwear.    The leading service-sector industry is projected to be mutual funds, with growth of 28% in assets. Other strong companies are expected to be in management, consulting, public relations, property and casualty insurance, data processing, life insurance, savings institutions, and health and medical services. </TEXT></DOC>
