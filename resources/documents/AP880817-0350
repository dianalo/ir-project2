For oil prices to stabilize, it ``would be desirable for Iranand Iraq to have a daily production of 2.3 million barrels,'' a cutof between 6,000 and 7,000 barrels a day, Subroto said in a newsconference on arrival here.   ``By adjusting production, in addition to remedying thesituation, the prices of the fuel will be higher,'' said Subroto.   The cease-fire that is to take effect Saturday in the 8-year-oldPersian Gulf war has raised speculation that the fractious cartelcould make progress in its attempts to meet production limits aimedat boosting world oil prices.   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has aproduction ceiling of 15.06 million barrels per day in an attemptto support its benchmark price of $18 a barrel, but Iraqiproduction has not been counted under the ceiling.   Actual world market prices currently are $2 to $3 a barrel lowerthan the benchmark.   Subroto, who plans to visit Iran and Iraq after leaving Mexico,also said crude oil prices next winter may be as high as $15 abarrel.   ``In the decade of the 90s, the prediction is that oil priceswill be strengthened,'' he said.   Since he was elected secretary-general of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries last June, Subroto has been seeking aconsensus over the means to stabilize oil prices. As part of theeffort, he has visited the United Arab Emirates, Ecuador andVenezuela and plans to visit all OPEC members and independentproducers.   Mexico the world's sixth-largest producer of crude, is not anOPEC member but follows the cartel's pricing and productionpolicies when it believes they contribute to stability in themarket.   Subroto said he would meet here with President Miguel de laMadrid and Energy Secretary Fernando Hiriart.   Mexico produces about 2.5 million barrels of crude a day andexported 1.35 million barrels a day in July. About half the exportsgo to the United States.   Separately, in Caracas former Venezuela oil minister HumbertoCalderon Berti said Wednesday that the OPEC price monitoringcommittee tentatively was scheduled to meet Sept. 20 in Jakarta,Indonesia.   The date and place of the committee's meeting will be confirmedwithin the next few days, according to Calderon Berti, who said heconsulted with Subroto privately Tuesday in Caracas.   Members of the price committee are Venezuela, Indonesia,Algeria, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. The committee monitors factors,especially crude output, which affect OPEC's to meet its benchmarkprice.   Calderon Berti also said Subroto said he supported raisingOPEC's production ceiling to between 17.5 million and 18 millionbarrels per day in a new production accord to be hammered out atthe cartel's regular conference in November.   The new ceiling would allow OPEC to incorporate Iraq's output,currently around 2.5 million barrels a day, into a new accordwithout cutting the production of other member countries.</TEXT></DOC>
