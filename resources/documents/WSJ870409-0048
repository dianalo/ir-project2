Sales for the quarter exceeded $200 million, he said. The earnings and sales figures, both better than analysts expected, indicate that Compaq's sales during the quarter weren't hurt significantly by the prospect of a new line of computers that International Business Machines Corp. was expected to introduce at the end of the period. IBM unveiled the new models, which will compete with Compaq's offerings, last week.    &quot;Sales were particularly strong in March, when some might have expected slackening demand in anticipation of the new IBM computers,&quot; Mr. Canion said in an interview. &quot;We saw the opposite of that,&quot; he added.    In the year-earlier quarter, Compaq earned $8.3 million, or 27 cents a share, on sales of $144 million.    First-quarter earnings per share were &quot;somewhat higher&quot; than the 42 cents that is about the average of analysts' estimates, Mr. Canion said. He couldn't provide a specific estimate because the company still is computing the average number of shares outstanding for the period.    Mr. Canion attributed the revenue increase to &quot;continuing demand for our high-end products.&quot; He noted that sales of the Deskpro 386, an advanced computer the company introduced in September; Portable III, an improved version of the company's previous portable models; and the new Deskpro 286, based on a faster microprocessor than was used in previous versions of the same computer, all are having strong sales. &quot;That's our front line, and it's doing very well,&quot; Mr. Canion said.    Michael J. Geran, analyst with E.F. Hutton Inc., said that the computer industry as a whole had seen a good fourth quarter. Compaq's results &quot;make it look like that momentum carried over into the first quarter,&quot; Mr. Geran said. He said he didn't expect IBM's new machines to have a big effect on Compaq in the next few months, partly because some of the models IBM announced aren't yet available. &quot;After IBM is up and running, who knows what's going to happen?&quot; Mr. Geran said.    Mr. Canion noted that not since 1984 &quot;have we had a first quarter with higher revenue than the fourth quarter of the previous year,&quot; referring to Compaq's fourth-quarter 1986 revenue of $186.9 million.    But Compaq's net in the fourth quarter of $16.2 million, or 49 cents a share, was higher than the figure the company expects to report for the first period, despite the expected 8% quarter-to-quarter revenue improvement. Mr. Canion attributed the expected decline in net margin to &quot;start-up costs associated with new product introductions.&quot; The new version of the Deskpro 286 was introduced about a month ago and the Portable III was brought out in February.    Mr. Canion said he didn't see the need for any immediate actions to respond to competition from the new IBM computers, which deviate from the standard design IBM set in 1981 upon which Compaq's machines also are based. He said Compaq would wait to see if the new IBM computers are successful in the marketplace before making any decision about coming out with new models to match them.    &quot;We're going to concentrate on delivering the products users are demanding right now&quot; Mr. Canion said.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Compaq shares rose $1.375 to $32.375. </TEXT></DOC>
