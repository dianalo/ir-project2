The measure by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), chairmanof the Ways and Means Committee, would allow businesses todepreciate over 14 years the value of &quot;intangible&quot; assets --such as customer lists, a bank's roster of core depositors orpublishers' subscriber lists -- that one business purchasesfrom another. Such assets, which represent a business's &quot;goodwill&quot; or &quot;going-concern value,&quot; would qualify for the firsttime under the tax code for breaks traditionally given to&quot;tangible&quot; assets, such as machinery.</LP><TEXT>   The winners under the proposal would include purchasers ofassets of the sort that have been denied write-offs or havequalified for write-offs longer than 14 years. Losers mightinclude some purchasers of financial institutions, publishersor software dealers -- the sort of companies that, largelythrough the courts, have won write-offs of less than 14 yearsfor certain assets.   The legislation, if it becomes law, would mark a majordevelopment in business taxation. Purchasers of businessesand their assets have been increasingly aggressive in writingoff such assets, especially since some businesses went intodebt when making acquisitions in the 1980s. Meanwhile, theInternal Revenue Service has been just as aggressive incontesting those deductions -- at a heavy cost to both sidesin litigation. Court rulings have been contradictory, thoughbusinesses have been more successful recently.   &quot;This bill is intended to provide certainty to taxpayerswhile eliminating the source of much tax litigation andcontroversy, thus freeing up for more productive use of theresources of taxpayers,&quot; Rep. Rostenkowski said in astatement.   The administration welcomed the bill. &quot;We haven't seen thefinal version,&quot; a Treasury official said, &quot;but we've beeninterested in this, and we are likely to be supportive.&quot;   Rep. Rostenkowski said he would push the idea as part ofan overall tax-simplification effort that he and his Senatecounterpart, Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D.,Texas), have undertaken. Final action is unlikely before nextyear. The legislation wouldn't be retroactive; it would applyonly to assets purchased after the bill becomes law.   Rep. Rostenkowski said he settled on the 14-year figurebecause any shorter write-off period would have cost theTreasury tax revenue, expanding the deficit. Instead, hisplan would raise a modest amount. Businesses generally favora shorter write-off period, depending on the asset, thoughthe Rostenkowski proposal is more generous than some taxtheorists have proposed.   Currently, business taxpayers can gradually deduct thevalue of assets over time if they can show that the assetshave a definite value and a limited lifespan. Assets thatcannot meet the tests fall into the &quot;good will&quot; or&quot;going-concern value&quot; categories and cannot be amortized.   The IRS has taken a hard line, contending that a company'scustomer base amounts to a measure of its good will. So whilea purchaser of a business that consists mostly of hard assetscan write off most, if not all, of the purchase price, thebuyer of a bank, a publishing company or a home-heating-oildistributor typically couldn't deduct much of its purchaseprice if a write-off for the value of a customer base isdisallowed.   More and more, however, businesses have turned toappraisers and tax attorneys to marshal the evidence neededto succeed either in the IRS's audit procedures or in court.</TEXT></DOC>
