<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-74-0199 </DOCNO><TEXT>A global characterization method for studying hydroxyaromatic compoundsin coal liquids is presented. This method includes: short path distillationof crude sample, selective separation of hydroxyaromatic compounds onanion exchange resin, spectrometric analyses (1H and 19F NMR and massspectrometry). From the different analytical results functional groupsare determined which lead to a very convenient representation of thestudied sample. 17 refs., 3 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
