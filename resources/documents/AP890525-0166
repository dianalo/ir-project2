LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South Korean authorities Thursdayordered radical students to stop burning U.S. flags atanti-American protests on college campuses and said those caughtwould be punished.   School officials were told to prevent students from defiling theStars and Stripes, education officials said. Offenders facetwo-year jail terms under South Korean Law.   On Monday, radical students began a week of anti-Americanprotests in Seoul and other cities. They have repeatedly burnedflags and effigies of Uncle Sam wearing the Stars and Stripes.   Protests were to call for the withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S.troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.Radicals and dissidents say the U.S. troops hamper unification withcommunist North Korea.   They also say the United States props up authoritarian rule inSouth Korea.   On Thursday, about 500 radical students calling for theoverthrow of President Roh Tae-woo battled riot police at KoreaUniversity after an anti-government rally. Students hurledfirebombs and rocks and police responded in kind. There were noreports of injuries or arrests.   At Dankook University, about 200 students held a peaceful rallyto denounce Roh and the United States. Riot police surrounded theschool, but did not intervene.   Meanwhile, police raided a gallery in downtown Seoul Thursdayand seized a large painting of the U.S. flag displayed on the floorwhere it was walked upon by visitors. Students at four schools inSeoul painted huge Stars and Stripes on campus roadways sopedestrians and vehicles could walk or drive on them.   Newspapers in Seoul Thursday carried critical commentaries andeditorials urging radical students to stop their harassment of afriendly nation.   ``Defaming a nation's flag is a deplorable act,'' the ForeignMinistry said in a statement Monday.   Korean government officials are concerned that anti-U.S.sentiment may create an anti-Korean backlash in the United States,South Korea's largest trade partner.   The Korea Herald, an English-language newspaper in Seoul, saidin an editorial Thursday: ``That uncivilized outrage of soiling anddisgracing the flag of a nation is self-degrading andself-defeating at the same time.''   Most South Koreans support the presence of U.S. troops.Officials have said American forces will remain as long as they arewanted by the Seoul government. Radical students lack publicsupport because of their violent tactics and extreme views.   Meanwhile, about 700 teachers nationwide took part in sit-inscalling for better working conditions and trade unions. They wereprotesting a government threat to bring criminal charges against 34colleagues who were called in for questioning, sources said.</TEXT></DOC>
