When her mother tried to explain over dinner why she wasleaving for the Army, the little girl tore her paper placemat to bits. For two whirlwind days, Maggie clung to hermother, an activated reservist who frantically packed andarranged for the child to move to her father's house. Hoursafter watching her mother board a jet, Maggie cried to hergrandmother, &quot;I'm lonesome for my momma.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I told her to hug her bear,&quot; says Maggie's grandmother,Mary Jean Horan. &quot;She said `I want my real momma, the one whowent on the plane.'&quot;   Maggie and thousands of other children are this war'searly casualties. War always takes a special toll onchildren, and this one, as usual, deeply affects even thosewith no relatives in the Gulf. But the impact is sharper thanever: Never before has a war ruptured so many of the nation'sfamilies, with both parents as well as single mothers oftenbeing sent to the front lines.   The National Childhood Grief Institute of Minneapolis andother mental health agencies around the nation have beenflooded with queries about dealing with children'snightmares, stomachaches and withdrawal. &quot;Parents make up achild's entire universe,&quot; says child expert Fred Rogers,whose trusted character Mister Rogers has produced televisionand radio spots to help soothe children's war fears. &quot;Whathappens when part or all of that universe is taken away?Nothing is more difficult for a child to deal with.&quot;   British children who were separated from their mothers inWorld War II to avoid bombing raids on London were moretraumatized than the ones left at home, studies showed. &quot;Thechildren who stayed with their parents in their familiarneighborhoods fared the best, even though they were in worsephysical danger,&quot; Mr. Rogers says.   Soft-spoken Shante Skillern of Canton, Ohio, would likenothing more than to have her parents at her side. But theclosest the 10-year-old can get is sitting glued to thetelevision news, watching for reports on Saudi Arabia, whereboth parents are stationed. &quot;Mom and Dad said not to worry,&quot;she says. &quot;I worry anyway.&quot;   The Army acknowledges that thousands of children are beingleft without parents, but says that is the price of avolunteer force and women's expanded role in it. &quot;This wasn'tunforeseen,&quot; says a Pentagon spokesman. The Army has far morewomen than the other branches: More than 82,000, or 11% ofits personnel. Of those, 16% are single mothers. About 53,000soldiers, or 7% of enlisted troops, are married to someoneelse in the Army.   For many women, volunteering wasn't just an act ofpatriotism but one of economic necessity. That immediatepressure outweighed any seemingly slim chance of being sentto war and separated from children. The military does what itcan to make sure the children aren't simply abandoned,insisting that parents appoint a guardian for their childrenwhen they enlist. &quot;It doesn't make it any easier on families,but it does set up a safety net,&quot; the Pentagon spokesmansays.   Each branch of the military has a &quot;family supportnetwork,&quot; including access to mental health professionals.Grandparents and other guardians are assigned a &quot;buddy&quot; fromArmy bases for periodic support phone calls. The Army hasalso allowed parental or hardship discharges in some cases.They are neither honorable nor dishonorable discharges, butthey sever all military benefits. They aren't often requestedand involve a lot of paper work; fewer than 100 have beengranted.   Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania has proposed legislationto prohibit more than one parent &quot;from serving in an imminentdanger area.&quot; Still, the bill, dubbed the &quot;Gulf orphan bill,&quot;is hardly perfect, the senator's aides say, because itdoesn't preclude both parents from being sent overseas, orcover single mothers -- like Maggie's, Kathleen Horan ofMinneapolis.   Maggie asks her father, Dan Gronert, whom she used to seeonly on weekends, &quot;will I see Momma tomorrow?&quot; Maggie'smother has been gone for just two weeks, and he wonders howlong he can say, &quot;Sorry, honey, not tomorrow, not for awhile.&quot;   &quot;I love being with my daughter, but not under thesecircumstances,&quot; Mr. Gronert says. &quot;It's very hard for amother to be away from her child, especially when she's justthree.&quot;   When her grandmother tried to take Maggie to Sunday schoollast week, the girl screamed. &quot;She got very panicky aboutbeing left,&quot; says Mrs. Horan, who contacted the NationalChildhood Grief Institute for help. &quot;She's possibly feelingas if her mother's gone, poof, and that could affect howshe'll deal with people the rest of her life.&quot;   Terry Haugen, a therapist at the Grief Institute, saysthat for the youngest children, separation from war-boundparents can trigger deep feelings of grief and abandonment.If left alone with those feelings, psychologists agree,children can become &quot;forgotten grievers,&quot; at risk for lowself esteem, chronic sorrow, substance abuse and otherself-destructive behavior. Such problems won't play out foryears, and some resilient children will come throughrelatively unscathed.   Van Voorhis elementary school on the Army base at FortKnox, Ky., invented a &quot;Worry Wart&quot; jar, a tall glass jartopped by a friendly, fuzzy orange animal who stands guard&quot;over the worries kids can't do anything about,&quot; saysguidance counselor Debbie Jones. Inside are small scraps ofpaper on which children have scribbled &quot;I'm worried my dadwill get shot&quot; and &quot;I'm worried my dad won't have enoughwater in the desert&quot; and &quot;I'm worried my dad will never comehome.&quot; The jar and fuzzy animal are refuges for childrenscared that if they worry aloud, they may jinx their parentsand their worst fears will come true.   These kids, some of whom have become disruptive andjittery at school since the war erupted, are relativelysecure: All but one still live at home with their mothers.Children who lose their mothers, usually the parent who takescare of them the most, face greater trauma and often blamethemselves. &quot;A child in that circumstance can't help but ask,`Am I so bad that I deserve to be left?'&quot; says childdevelopment pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton of HarvardUniversity Medical School.   The blow is doubly hard for children suddenly uprootedfrom their homes and familiar schools and neighborhoods.Seven-year-old Jacob Derkin of Doylestown, Ohio, hadnightmares after his mother, a reservist, left home lastfall. He told his grandparents, with whom he was staying,&quot;I'm afraid this will be World War III.&quot; No one had realizedthe first-grader was aware of the first two world wars.   At school, in the middle of reading and math classes,Jacob would abruptly leave his seat and ask his teacher if hecould draw a picture for his mom. At home he became soobsessed with the news on TV that his grandparents made himturn it off. Then they had to throw out a Christmas gift, avideo in which a mother dinosaur dies, because Jacob becamehysterical watching it.   Jacob's mother is home now, after being released formedical reasons, but the month away seems to have changed herson. &quot;He didn't quite trust me, and wasn't very affectionatetoward me,&quot; she says. At one point, when she had to put onher uniform to report to her reserve center for just a day,Jacob burst into tears.   &quot;He asked if I got better, would I go back, and I saidyes. I'm not going to lie,&quot; says Ro-Ellen Derkin, commanderof an evacuation hospital unit, nearly half of whosepersonnel are mothers. She is painfully torn between herfeelings about Jacob and her two-year-old son Joseph and herduty to her country. &quot;I made a commitment and gave my word,and those are the values you want to teach your kids. Butit's harder than hard to leave. They're my babies and I wantto be with them.&quot;   Some women reservists protest the need for such anemotional tug of war. Peggy West, an Army nurse, was sent toSaudi Arabia last fall, three months after the birth of hersecond child. She wonders why she and other mothers couldn'tserve in hospitals in Europe and bring their children along.That way, &quot;we wouldn't have to watch our babies growing up onvideos.&quot;   After five months, Mrs. West, whose husband also isserving in the Gulf, took a hardship discharge from the Armyand returned to Myrtle Beach, S.C., because her mother andmother-in-law could no longer care for her children.   With wave after wave of reservists being activated,soldiers are scrambling to marshal child-care forces, turningto aunts, sisters and in some cases friends their childrenbarely know. Colleen Hudson of Pittsburgh received a franticcall last week from a foster daughter in Ohio she cared foronly briefly years ago. The foster daughter, now 22, and herhusband both have orders to report to their bases Thursdayand didn't know what to do with their two-year-old andone-month-old daughters.   &quot;I kept telling them to say they didn't have anyone tocare for the kids,&quot; says Mrs. Hudson. But the young coupleworried that the children would then be split up and shuffledto different foster homes. Mrs. Hudson agreed to take themherself, but worries, &quot;I don't know how I'm going to handleit.&quot;   Psychologists have some suggestions. &quot;Objects and ritualsthat belonged to their parents, things their mothers did,songs they sang and books they read are very important,&quot; saysMiriam Winikoff, a Pittsburgh child psychologist. &quot;Kids mightsay they'll only eat macaroni because that's what theyremember eating with their mothers.&quot; She and others recommendcreating a treasure box filled with letters, gifts and videosfrom absent parents and a memory book of photos.   Russell Milbrodt has begun a daily ritual with hisone-year-old son Zachary, walking him around the house topoint out photographs of the baby's mother, Cindy, who isstationed near Kuwait. &quot;Zachary holds the pictures, kissesthem, smiles and laughs,&quot; says Mr. Milbrodt. &quot;We call it`giving love.'&quot;   Still, Zachary, who used to sleep through the night, nowwakes up four or five times. &quot;He will only sleep if someonelies next to him, holding him,&quot; says Mr. Milbrodt.   His sister, four-year-old Tiffany, stands in front of thetelevision set whenever the news is on, singing, playing andtalking to distract her father from the constant barrage ofwar updates. &quot;I hold her and try to comfort her and stilllisten to what's going on because I need to know for me,&quot;says Mr. Milbrodt. In addition to his wife, he has asister-in-law, cousins and close friends in the Mideast.   When Tiffany asks him &quot;when is Mommy coming home?&quot; hereplies, &quot;In the springtime, when the flowers bloom,&quot; hopinghis wife's May discharge date will stand. &quot;If it's longer,&quot;he says, &quot;I'll have a lot of problems.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
