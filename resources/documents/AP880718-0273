On other markets, livestock and meat futures were broadly mixedin reaction to the plunging grain prices; sugar prices fell; energyfutures soared; precious metals advanced; and stock-index futuresretreated.   The weekend showers in the Farm Belt should help stressedsoybean plants recover and halt the deterioration of the corn crop,which is nearing the end of its critical pollination phase,analysts said.   Soybeans for July delivery skidded more than $1.09 a bushel, oneof the steepest one-day soybean price declines in the exchange'shistory. July corn plunged 30 cents a bushel. Prices for other cornand soybean contracts fell their respective limits of 15 cents and45 cents a bushel.   Rich Feltes, director of commodities research for Refco Inc., alarge, Chicago-based trading firm, called the price plunge ``atrain wreck'' and ``the biggest weather shocker of the summer.''   Rain also fell Monday in parts of the Farm Belt and more wasforecast for Tuesday. Temperatures in the wake of the cold frontwere expected to remain below the 90- and 100-degree readings thatbaked the Midwest last week.   ``I think people are sensing the (drought) pattern may bebreaking up,'' Feltes said. ``No one knows for certain, but we'vebought some important time for the 50 percent of the corn crop thathas not yet pollinated and certainly for the soybeans, which couldapproach yields that are above what the market's been trading.''   The National Weather Service issued a 6-to-10-day outlook afterthe markets closed, calling for above-normal temperatures andnormal to below-normal rainfall in the Midwest during the firstfive days of next week.   Soybeans will enter their most critical growing stage next weekwhen the pods now forming on the plants begin filling with beans,analysts said.   The soybean market has generally been more sensitive to weatherchanges this season than the grains because the relatively smallstockpile of soybeans raises the threat of a shortage if yields aresubstantially reduced.   Wheat settled 13 cents to 19{ cents lower with July at $3.69 abushel; corn was 15 cents to 30 cents lower with July at $3.03{ abushel; oats were 15 cents to 24{ cents lower with July at $2.87 abushel; soybeans were 45 cents to $1.09{ lower with July at $8.85 abushel.   Cattle futures finished widely mixed and pork futures weresharply lower, all in reaction to the falling grain prices,analysts said.   As grain prices rose during the past three months, livestocktraders sold contracts for summer and fall deliveries while biddingup prices for 1989 deliveries on the theory that rising feed costswould force livestock producers to sell more animals, therebyreducing the size of their breeding herds.   With the sudden drop in grain prices, traders took the oppositetack.   Live cattle settled 1.48 cents lower to .93 cent higher withAugust at 65.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent to thelimit 1.50 cents higher with August at 76.25 cents a pound; hogswere .05 cent to the limit 1.50 cents lower with July at 46.17cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .75 cent to the limit 2cents lower with July at 36.55 cents a pound.   Sugar futures prices dropped sharply in sympathy with soybeans.Sugar for October delivery on New York's Coffee, Sugar andamp; CocoaExchange settled .62 cent lower at 14.61 cents a pound.   Some energy futures soared their limits on the New YorkMercantile Exchange in response to news that Iran would accept aU.N. resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire to its nearly8-year-old war with Iraq. Iraq already has accepted the resolution.   Peace between the Persian Gulf countries could increase thechances for a united OPEC effort to reduce crude oil production,analysts said.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 60 cents to 92 centshigher with August at $15.70 a barrel; heating oil was 1.95 centsto 2.15 cents higher with August at 43.27 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was 1.38 cents to 2 cents higher with August at 51.11cents a gallon.   Precious metals prices fell on New York's Commodity Exchange inresponse to the falling grain prices, the stronger dollar andrising interest rates, analysts said.   Gold settled $2.40 to $2.50 lower with August at $438.80 a troyounce; silver was 16 cents to 16.5 cents lower with July at $7.15 atroy ounce.   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the contract for Septemberdelivery of the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index settled .50 point lowerat 272.30.</TEXT></DOC>
