The Paris-based OECD agreed with the British government'sforecast of a pickup in the economy before year end, butpredicted a mild rebound, with the jobless rate rising formonths.   The OECD also offered a succinct postmortem on how formerBritish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's economic miraclesoured. While her administration made significant gains inworkers' productivity and the government's financialposition, it ultimately lost control of inflation, whichflared up in 1987. This failure forced London to imposeever-higher interest rates until the economy slid intorecession in mid-1990.   The best prospect for subduing inflation, the OECD said,is the monetary arrangement Mrs. Thatcher was reluctant toembrace, the exchange-rate mechanism of the European MonetarySystem.                                                                                                          MUSSEL MARKET FLEXES IN BELGIUM                                                                                                          Wholesale prices for Zeeland mussels, the unofficialBelgian national dish this time of year, have nearly doubledfrom a year ago. A Belgian consumer group has accused theDutch producers of conspiratorial talk of a shortage to pushprices up. The producers blame the weather: Recent mildwinters boosted mussel predators and storms damaged harvests.At Brussels supermarkets, mussel prices are up and sales aredown. A chic Brussels restaurant said mussels are stillwildly popular despite a 15% price rise to $14.70, more thanan average steak.                                                                                                          OUTLOOK FOR JAPAN'S LAND PRICES                                                                                                          Land prices are expected to decline in Japan's three majormetropolitan areas, Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, in the secondhalf but may rise in other cities, a survey by the NihonKeizai Shimbun financial daily found. The survey, conductedin late July, involved local governments nationwide, 22financial institutions and 30 real estate and constructionconcerns. Respondents said the ripple effect from fallingprices in the three metropolitan areas could take a year toreach other cities.                                                                                                          MERCHANDISING VENTURE IN RUSSIA                                                                                                          A U.S.-Soviet merchandising venture, Bosmosco Inc., saidit will open 25 wholesale outlets in Russia in the next sixmonths. The venture already has two Moscow outlets at whichU.S. companies rent booth space and maintain exhibits,offering consumer goods to Soviet buyers from state-runenterprises who shop with hard currency. The new stores, inseveral cities, also will offer a variety of products fromU.S. companies.                                                                                                          OIL PLANS IN MEXICO, COLOMBIA                                                                                                          Mexico's state petroleum monopoly Pemex earmarked $665million to explore for new oil fields. Its reserves, nowabout 62 billion barrels, have shrunk over the past nineyears, mostly for lack of exploration cash. Separately,Colombia's state oil company Ecopetrol will invest $2.9billion over the next five years to explore for and refineoil, build petrochemical plants and put natural gas intohomes.                                                                                                          INDIAN SATELLITE IS LAUNCHED                                                                                                          An Indian space satellite, launched from the Soviet Union,will warn of floods and drought, help fishermen find catchesand control mosquitoes, among other development projects. Theremote-sensing IRS 1-B satellite's three cameras will monitorIndia's coastline and provide data on weather, undergroundwater and oil, and crops. India's IRS 1-A satellite, launchedfrom the U.S.S.R. in March 1988, is nearing the end of itslife span.                                                                                                          CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S INFLATION SOARS                                                                                                          Inflation in Czechoslovakia soared at an annual rate of59.1% in June, six months after Prague jettisoned most of thecentral-pricing mechanisms of the former Communist regime.   Since Jan. 1, when Czechoslovakia took its first big steptoward a market economy, consumer prices have risen 49.2%.Now Prague hopes the worst is over as it prepares majorindustrial reforms to begin next year, such as privatizingstate enterprises. An encouraging sign is that preliminarydata for July show prices beginning to flatten.   But Czechoslovakia may experience further inflationpressure as wage settlements try to give consumers buyingpower and as the country depends increasingly on non-Sovietoil supplies. Retail prices for energy products are to go upin October, for example.   Unemployment was 4% in July. Gross national product fellan inflation-adjusted 9.2% in the first half from a yearearlier, and declining output is expected. Though Praguedoesn't expect to have a fully convertible currency for atleast five years, foreign trade began to pick up this summer:Czechoslovakia had a first-half trade deficit of $357.1million, but a May-June trade surplus of $121.4 million.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          Germany said it has lost hundreds of millions of marks intax revenue because 69 million cigarettes were smuggled inthrough Poland in the first half, up from 20 million, mostlyU.S. brands, in the previous six months. Bonn is tighteningborder controls. . . . Ireland's restrictions on short-termdeposits from overseas could be scrapped in January, leadingto an influx of funds and bolstering Irish money marketliquidity and currency reserves. Ireland must abolishexchange controls before the end of 1992 to conform to theEuropean Community's single-market initiative.</TEXT></DOC>
