The intended usesof the leased assets might include, but are not necessarily limited to,participation in national and international trade or air shows, foreignmilitary sales or direct foreign sales demonstrations, independent researchand development efforts by defense firms, and direct or indirect supportof United States Government (USG) contracts. This part does not apply tomilitary leases of USG property to foreign governments or internationalorganizations (such as, North Atlantic Treaty Organization) under Chapter6 of the Arms Export Control Act. This part establishes the responsibilitiesfor evaluating lease requests, obtaining approvals, and negotiating andadministering the lease agreements. This part applies to the Office ofthe Secretary of the Air Force, the Air Staff, Air Force Systems Command(AFSC), and Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC). This part requires coordinationwith the USAF operational commands, the Air Force Reserve, and the AirNational Guard when their assets are under consideration for lease.

The statuteprovides that the property must be under the control of the department;not for the time needed for public use; and not excess property. Typically,the USAF does not lease assets which are otherwise available from commercialsources. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 863.2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">SAF/AQ responsibilities. </ITAG>(a) The Secretary of the Air Force delegated the statutory authority toapprove leases to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition(SAF/AQ). Since final leasing authority rests at the secretariat level,field and staff elements must take care not to preempt or prejudice theSecretary's authority to determine whether a proposed lease is advantageousto the United States and what terms and conditions will be considered aspromoting the national defense or being in the public interest. (b) SAF/AQ determines whether a lease request from a nongovernment organizationor from a command on behalf of a nongovernment organization meets the generalguidelines of this part. Furthermore, SAF/AQ ensures that the Air Staff(HQ USAF/LE, PR, XO, CC), the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force(SAF/AC, PA, GC), Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA), and USAF operationalcommands, the Air Force Reserve, or Air National Guard when their assetsare potential lease candidates have coordinated, as necessary, before recommendingthat SAF/AQ sign a Determination and Finding (Dandamp;F). This document designateswhich command, normally AFSC or AFLC, will negotiate and execute the leaseagreement and outlines the basic terms and conditions which must be containedin the lease. SAF/AQ makes the determination if it is unclear whether AFSCor AFLC should assume a particular leasing action. The determination andfinding format for authority to lease United States government propertyis shown below. <ITAG tagnum="74">Determination and Finding Format </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Department of the Air Force (USAF) proposes to lease aircraftto    for a    period.

When a prospective lessee desires to lease an asset beingacquired or managed by a System Program Office (SPO), that SPO evaluatesthe lease request, makes its recommendation to HQ AFSC/PKC, and negotiatesthe lease agreement, if approved by SAF/AQ.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 863.4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">AFLC responsibilities.</ITAG>AFLC evaluates lease requests, determines asset availability, and negotiatesapproved leases. When a prospective lessee requests the lease of an assetmanaged by AFLC or an asset under the control of any of the USAF operationalcommands, the AFLC Air Logistics Center (ALC) most familiar with the assetevaluates the lease request and makes its recommendation to HQ AFLC/PM.The Wright-Patterson Contracting Center (WPCC) negotiates the lease agreement,if approved by SAF/AQ.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Basic Terms and Conditions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 863.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Authorized uses.</ITAG>The lease agreement will specify what uses may be made of the leased property.The authorized uses of the leased property need not support a USG contractor requirement. The lease may limit or specify the location of lease performance.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 863.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Lease charges.</ITAG>(a) Lease charges are comprised of rent, reimbursement of any out of pocketexpense to the USG, and other costs which the lessee must pay accordingto the terms of the lease. Pursuant to 32 CFR Part 288, User Charges, rentmust include charges for depreciation and interest on investment. Thesecharges may be assessed on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis as determinedappropriate by the cotnracting officer. For example, if the lease periodis short term or if the leased property is being modified in such a wayas to preclude its return to the USAF for immediate use to satisfy a USGmission requirement, charge rent during the entire lease term. However,if the lease period is long term and lease activities are actually intermittentrather than continuous, charge rent only during those times the leasedproperty is actually in use by the lessee or unavailable for USAF use.(<T3>Note.</T3>_Periods of use are defined in the lease.)(b) It may be appropriate to assess flying-hour charges if an aircraftis leased. Flying hour charges can be assessed for depot maintenance, replenishmentspares, base support, etc., depending on the leasing situation. If an operationalaircraft is leased, payment of depot maintenance and replenishment sparescharges would be in order. If the lessee is authorized under the leaseto obtain spare parts from the supply system, the lessee should eitherpay the spares flying-hour charges or reimburse the USG the cost of thespare part plus the cost of providing it.(c) Leases should include a charge for general and administrative expensesof the USG. The contracting officer should assess a charge of 10 percentof all other lease charges to recoup the USG's general and administrativeexpenses.(d) SAF/ACCS sets depreciation, interest on investment, and flying-hourcharges. When the specific item to be leased is identified, these ratesmay be based on supplemental information from the SPO or ALC as to theproperty's acquisition cost, replacement cost, age, major modifications,salvage value, etc. When the specific item is not identified or actualcosts are unknown, use reasonable estimates. The contracting officer isauthorized to communicate directly with SAF/ACCS in determining rentalcharges. Also assess rent for pieces of support equipment which the lesseemay require to support the major items of leased property. In such cases,SAF/ACCS may recommend the use of the rates set forth in the Use and Chargesclause in the Federal Acquisition Regulation for rental computation.(e) When the lease activity being pursued by the lessee is of particularinterest to the USG, the contracting officer may arrange to receive a technicalreport from the lessee. The value of the report, as established by thecontracting officer, can represent a credit against rental charges otherwisedue under the lease. Such a credit must not exceed the rental charges owedby the lessee.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 8637.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">No cost to the USG.</ITAG>The lessee is responsible for all rent, costs and charges relating to theleased property during the lease. Generally, the lessee may not includeany charges or costs resulting from the lease directly or indirectly inany USG contract or subcontract. Exceptions may be approved for contractsfor foreign military sales, for independent research and development costs,international air show costs and in other limited cases where specificUSG contracts or programs benefit from the lease activities or when otherwiseauthorized by law.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 863.8</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Risk of loss.</ITAG>The lessee must agree to assume the risk of loss, damage, or destructionof the leased property during the period of the lease. This applies whenequipment or an aircraft is leased whether a lessee or USAF operator orpilot is operating the equipment or acting as pilot in command. The lesseemust obtain insurance to cover the insurable value of the leased property,unless the contracting officer agrees that the lessee may be self-insured.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 863.9</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Indemnification of the USG.</ITAG>The lessee must agree to hold harmless and indemnify the USG, its agents,employees, and officers from any and all loss and liability. The lesseemust obtain insurance adequate to cover all such liabilities.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 863.10</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Maintenance responsibilities.</ITAG>The lessee must maintain the leased property during the lease period accordingto standards established by the USG or pay the cost of maintenance accomplishedby the USG.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 863.11</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Inspection responsibilities.</ITAG>The contracting officer should ensure appropriate inspections are performedby contract administration services personnel or others during lease performanceand by the activity receiving the property after lease performance to determinewhether the lessee maintained and leased property according to USAF standards.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 863.12</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">USG support.</ITAG>Any support provided the lessee by the USG will be on a noninterference,cost-reimbursable basis. This applies to material, facilities, supportaircraft, and crewmembers.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 863.13</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Terminating the lease agreement.</ITAG>The USG may terminate the lease at any time and at no cost. The lesseemay terminate the lease upon prior written notice to the contracting officerand subject to its residual responsibilities under the lease (payment ofcharges, return of the leased property, etc.). In long-term leases it maybe appropriate to provide for periodic interruptions of the lease so theleased property can be returned to the USG to satisfy its requirements.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 863.14</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">DSAA and State Department approvals.</ITAG>When a lessee poroposes to demonstrate the leased property to representativesof foreign governments or international organizations or to participatein international air shows, the lessee must secure DSAA approval and obtainexport license clearance from the State Department. If the lessee knowsthe details of the proposed demonstration or evaluation at the time thelease request is submitted, SAF/AQ will obtain DSAA coordination when processingthe lease request to the SAF/AQ for approval. If these details are unknownat the time of the lease request, then the lessee must obtain DSAA approvalby separate request through HQ USAF/PRI (Directorate of International Programs)channels.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 863.15</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Flights for dignitaries.</ITAG>The lessee must get prior approval for flights if one of the authorizeduses of a leased aircraft is orientation flights for foreign nationalsor dignitaries, including members of Congress and representatives of theUS news media (see DOD Regulation 4515.13R).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 863.16</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Air show participation plan clause.</ITAG>Leases authorizing participation in an international air show must containa provision requiring the lessee to obtain prior USAF approval of its plansfor conducting flight operations and providing adequate crew rest.
