(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The head of the coal miners' union onMonday accepted a new, unconditional offer from Gov. Gaston Capertonfor talks aimed at ending a union walkout and related wildcatstrikes by nearly 43,000 miners.   But the chairman of coal company that is the object of the unrestsaid he's tied up with jury duty this week.   Also Monday, a federal judge in Virginia fined the union $240,000for its strike tactics against Pittston, while a federal judge inClarksburg refused to order strikers back to work.   Wildcat strikes in sympathy with United Mine Workers strikeagainst the Pittston Co. continued Monday in West Virginia,Illinois, Pennsylvania, Alabama, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Virginiaand Tennessee. However, most UMW members began their two-weekvacations this week, and the coal fields have been relatively quietsince the weekend.   About 350 UMW members in Missouri ended their wildcat strikeMonday and called on Caperton to help end the union's dispute withPittston. They also asked him to bring a halt to violence thaterupted on picket lines in the past week.   In addition, a federal judge in Charleston reset hearings onwhether to bar more wildcat strikes and find miners in contempt forignoring his back-to-work orders.   Caperton invited Pittston Chairman Paul Douglas and UMW PresidentRichard Trumka last week to meet at the governor's mansion and hashout a contract. Trumka accepted.   But Caperton tacked on four conditions that led Douglas to rejectit: that both sides negotiate in good faith; that Pittston not useany other coal companies to fill its orders; that the union end allwildcat strikes; and that other companies suing the UMW because ofthe strikes suspend their litigation.   On Monday, Caperton dropped the conditions and reissued the offer.   Trumka again accepted.   Douglas declined to say if he would accept, adding he has beencalled for jury duty in New York this week. However, Douglas saidfrom Pittston headquarters in Greenwich, Conn., ``Any communicationwe get from the governor will get due consideration.''   Pittston has said its last contract offer, made June 9, will beits best. After the UMW rejected that offer, Pittston declared animpasse and imposed its own contract at its operations.   About 1,600 UMW miners in Virginia and West Virginia went onstrike against Pittston on April 5 after working for 14 monthswithout a contract. They were joined by 300 Kentucky miners earlierthis month.   That strike spurred sympathy walkouts around the coal fields.Since June 12, when the wildcat strikes began, 43,000 miners in 10states have gone off the job.   Figures released Monday by the U.S. Energy InformationAdministration show that national coal production fell 1.2 milliontons, from 19.5 million to 18.3 million, in the week following thestart of the wildcat strikes.   Caperton said his offer to be host of negotiations has improvedthe atmosphere in the coal fields.   ``It has evidenced itself in the form of a calmer, gentleratmosphere in our coal fields, a sense that something versus nothingis being done,'' he said.   A teen-ager was grazed with a bullet on a West Virginia picketline last week, and pickets at a Kentucky mine overturned a jeepbeing ridden by a company official. Shots also have been fired atmines in Alabama.   In Charleston, U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp reset a hearingfor July 3 on five coal companies' request that the UMW and itsmembers be held in contempt for ignoring his back-to-work orders.Knapp's office also said the judge has reset for July 11 a hearingon 13 companies' request that he issue a preliminary injunction tohalt wildcat walkouts in West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky.Both of those hearings originally were set for last Friday.   In Abingdon, Va., U.S. District Judge Glen Williams ruled thatdaily convoys on coal hauling roads are being orchestrated by theunion and violate his order prohibiting the UMW from blocking themovement of coal trucks.   Williams found the UMW and two officials in contempt of court andissued fines totaling $240,000.   In Clarksburg, U.S. District Judge William Kidd deniedConsolidation Coal Co.'s request that he order its union miners backto work in Monongalia, Marion and Harrison counties. Kidd alsodissolved a temporary restraining order against picketing at themines.   And in another court development in Kentucky, Pittston's EasternCoal Co. subsidiary subpoenaed an Associated Press correspondent'sfilm of a union rally as part of a civil suit it has filed againstthe UMW.   Jon Fleischaker, a Louisville attorney representing correspondentRob Wells and the AP, said he intends to fight the company's request.</TEXT></DOC>
