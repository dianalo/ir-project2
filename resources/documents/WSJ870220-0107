Dyson, said the company is in talks to buy several bottling operations from Coca-Cola Co.    And the Atlanta-based bottling concern is prepared to spend as much as $300 million for such acquisitions as part of an expansion strategy, Mr. Dyson told analysts in Wesley Chapel, Fla.    The acquisitions would be part of a goal to increase to 50% from 38% Coca-Cola Enterprises' current share of all Coca-Cola bottling business during the next three to five years, Mr. Dyson said. He said the acquisitions would be in territories contiguous to those it already owns.    Mr. Dyson said Coca-Cola Enterprises is in preliminary talks to buy Beaumont Coca-Cola Bottling Co., with plants in Beaumont and Paris, Texas; Alabama Coca-Cola Bottling Co., with operations in Oxford, Ala.; and Hygeia Coca-Cola Bottling Co., with plants in Pensacola and Tallahassee, Fla. These companies are among bottlers known as the Rainwater Group. The company also is interested in buying Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Southern Florida, but hasn't had any discussions on that.    All of these bottling concerns were purchased by Coca-Cola Co. in October, a month before 51% of the common stock of Coca-Cola Enterprises was sold to the public. Coca-Cola Co., the Atlanta-based softdrink, food and entertainment concern, retains a 49% stake. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Coca-Cola Enterprises closed at $17 a share, up 12.5 cents.    Mr. Dyson said Coca-Cola Enterprises is prepared to add as much as $300 million to its debt -- which currently totals $1.88 billion -- to finance acquisitions.    A spokesman for Coca-Cola Co. said that Coca-Cola Enterprises &quot;is a potential purchaser&quot; of the properties Mr. Dyson mentioned but that it &quot;would be among any number of buyers.&quot;    Lawrence R. Cowart, Coca-Cola Enterprises' chief financial officer, said the company also plans &quot;a very large public debt offering,&quot; probably in April. This is part of an effort to restructure debt to cut annual interest expense, currently estimated at between $135 million and $150 million. Mr. Cowart said the offering would include the marketing of certain bonds, but he wouldn't be more specific. </TEXT></DOC>
