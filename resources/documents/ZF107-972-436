 Can't be removed for off-site storage.andM;Recommended: For users with little money and even less time.andM;Most PCs, even older ones, have drive slots that can accommodate fourhalf-height devices.andP;  And most hard-drive controllers can manage more thanone drive.andP;  With hard drive prices edging downward, you can purchase a seconddrive for less than $500.andM;You can further economize by purchasing a backup drive that is slower andsmaller than your main drive.andP;  Buy a software package, such as FifthGeneration Systems' Fastback Plus, that can back up files while you're awayfrom the computer, perhaps during your lunch hour or after work.andP;  If you'renot waiting around to use the computer, you don't need a fast hard drive.andM;The second hard drive can be half the size of your primary drive, providedyou set your backup program to copy only those files that are new or changedand keep copies of applications on floppies instead of storing themneedlessly on the second drive.andM;A second hard drive can also keep you functioning if the files on yourprimary drive are erased or scrambled, or if the heads crash into theplatters--unless the cause of the crash was the controller card that managesboth drives.andM;Unfortunately, because the drive is a permanent part of a PC, you can't storedata off-site, where it is safe from fire, theft, and other natural andunnatural acts.andM;2.andP;  Buy a tape backup system.andM;Cost: $500 to $2,500, depending on capacity.andM;Pros: Media can be transferred to similarly equipped PCs and stored off-site.andO;Allows unattended backups.andM;Cons: More expensive than a second hard drive.andP;  Most tape backup systems arenot random-access devices and can't be used in place of a damaged hard drive.andM;Recommended: For user who want off-site security and need to transfer largeamounts of data to similar systems.andM;Tape drives generally cost only a few hundred dollars more than hard drivesof the same capacity, although the price rises faster as a tape drive'scapacity and speed increase.andP;  But if you have to back up very large harddrives, tape backups offer the most convenience and the lowest cost permegabyte of storage.andP;  Tape drives allow you to transfer files from onetape-equipped system to another with the same backup hardware and software.andO;And because the tape cartridges are removable, you can keep copies ofimportant files locked away off-site.andM;On the downside, in most cases you can't use a tape drive in lieu of a harddrive.andP;  If your primary drive is down, you're out of luck until you cantransfer the tape files to a working hard drive.andM;Though tape drives are often bundled with their own backup software, thebundled programs can be more difficult to use than commercial programs, andsome tape drives can function only with their proprietary software.andP;  To avoidsurprises, buy products from reliable companies, and insist on testing outtape drive systems that rely on proprietary backup programs.andP;  Better yet,consider the QIC (Quarter Inch Cartridge) backup systems, available from CoreInternational, Tallgrass Technologies, Mountain Computer, and other reputablemanufacturers.andP;  QIC devices, which are installed as the B: drive on yoursystem's floppy disk controller, are efficient and less expensive than mostother tape backup systems.andM;3.andP;  Buy a removable mass storage drive.andM;Cost: $700 to $8,000, depending on storage technology.andM;Pro: Media can be transferred to similarly equipped Pcs and stored off-site.andO;Allows unattended backups.andP;  Removable drive can substitute for primary drive.andM;Cons: Expensive.andM;Recommended: For those who want the best features of both a second hard driveand a tape backup system and for whom expense is not an issue.andM;Removable mass storage systems take on many forms--removable hard drives,Bernoulli Boxes, hard cartridges, and magneto-optical drives--and for backupsthey combine the best features of both a second hard drive and a tape drive.andO;Like a second hard drive, these devices can substitute for an incapacitatedprimary drive.andP;  And like a tape system, they allow you to maintain backupcopies off-site.andP;  With the right software, backing up with removable massstorage devices is a painless process.andM;In fact, the only drawback of removable mass storage systems is their cost.andO;Prices for 40MB removable hard drives begin at about $700.andP;  Hard cartridgedrives cost a couple hundred more.andP;  Bernoulli Boxes start at about $1,000,and magneto-optical drives can cost up to $8,000.andP;  But if ease of use andsecurity are more important to you than cost, removable mass storage is theway to go.andM;4.andP;  Add another floppy drive.andM;Cost: Approximately $100.andM;Pros: Media can be transferred to other PCs and stored off-site.andM;Cons: Requires user to attend to backup manually.andM;Recommended: For budget-minded users with more time than money.andM;For a mere $100 you can buy a second floppy drive and eliminate much of thetedium of backup.andM;To back up your hard drive with only one 5 1/4-inch drive or one 3 1/2-inchdrive--or even one of each--you must insert a diskette into the drive, waitfor files to fill it up, remove it, and insert a new disk.andP;  The disk swappingalone can increase by one-third the time it takes to back up a hard disk.andM;Many commercial backup programs, including the ones that are listed inSolution 5, below, allow you to back up your data onto two floppy drives ofequal capacity.andP;  While the program uses drive A:, for example, you remove thefloppy disk in drive B: and insert a fresh one.andP;  When the backup programfinishes with drive A:, it automatically begins writing files to drive B:.andO;The process flip-flops so that one drive is always in use.andM;Straightforward Software SolutionsandM;5.andP;  Buy a good backup program.andM;Cost: $75 to $200.andM;Pros: Faster and easier than using DOS's BACKUP command.andP;  Condenses data sobackups take less storage space.andM;Cons: An added expense because DOS and many tape drives include their ownbackup programs.andM;Recommended: For any user who does backups.andM;Commercial backup programs make backup easier and faster, even if you haveonly a single floppy drive.andP;  Among the better programs are Fastback Plus($189 from Fifth Generation Systems, Baton Rouge, Louisiana; 504-291-7221),PC Full-bak Plus ($99 from Westlake Data, Austin, Texas; 512-328-1041), andBackit ($129.95 from Gazelle Systems, Provo, Utah; 801-377-1288).andM;Backup programs are invariably faster and easier to use than DOS's BACKUPcommand, which requires more steps and long cryptic commands filled withmodifiers and switches.andP;  Commercial programs, on the other hand, are oftenmenu-driven and include special routines that compress files so backupsrequire less disk or tape space.andP;  Commercial backup programs are essentiallyalike, so buy the cheapest one available.andM;6.andP;  Use a shareware program.andM;Cost: $60 or less.andM;Pros: Low cost.andM;Cons: Fewer advanced features.andM;Recommended:  For experienced users trying to save money.andM;Some software backup programs available through user groups and bulletinboard systems can manage your backup chores for less than half the cost oftheir commercial counterparts.andP;  Shareware programs include Still AnotherBackup Utility ($25), Point andamp; Shoot Backup/Restore ($35), and BackupMaestro($59).andP;  The Backup Companion is a public-domain program distributed for free.andO;All of these programs are available on CompuServe's IBM Systems Forum (GOIBMSYS).andP;  Using them will make your backup chores easier than they would bewith DOS, but they can't match the commercial programs' fancy interfaces,advanced features, and technical support.andM;Working with What You've GotandM;7.andP;  Limit your backups.andM;Cost: $0.andM;Pros: Saves time and diskettes.andP;  Requires only DOS and a single floppy drive.andM;Cons: You could miss some files that aren't stored in your normaldirectories.andM;Recommended: For users with few applications and whose directory structurerarely changes.andM;If you often back up your entire hard disk, you're doing unnecessary work.andO;In case of hard disk disaster you need only your data files.andP;  You can alwaysrestore applications programs from their original distribution disks.andM;To save yourself time and effort, you should begin by performing two completebackups (store one of them off-site); after that do only partial, ormaintenance, backups periodically.andP;  Do another full backup only if you'vemade extensive changes to the directory structure.andM;When you do maintenance backups with the DOS BACKUP command, whether to atape drive, hard disk, or floppies, DOS sets the files' archive bits toindicate which files have been backed up.andP;  For future backups you can typeBACKUP /M to tell DOS to copy only those files that are new or changed.andM;8.andP;  Back up only the essentials.andM;Cost: $0.andM;Pros: May allow you access to files in case of hard disk crash.andP;  Requiresonly DOS and one floppy drive.andM;Cons: Not helpful in all types of crashes.andP;  Does not back up data files.andM;Recommended: For the terminally lazy.andM;Many hard drive crashes are caused by software or hardware that hashes eitherthe system files that make a hard drive bootable or the file allocation table(FAT), which keeps track of all your files.andP;  Your programs and data usuallysurvive; you just can't access them.andM;For minimum insurance, format a floppy with the /s switch to make it bootableand copy all the files needed to access your hard drive and other hardwarethat requires special drivers, such as a video card or added memory.andP;  (Ifyou're not sure which drivers your PC uses, check your CONFIG.SYS file.andP;  Anyline that begins &quot;DEVICE=&quot; contains the name of a driver file.)andP;  Copy thesedrivers to the bootable floppy along with copies of your CONFIG.SYS andAUTOEXEC.BAT files.andP;  Edit the floppy's CONFIG and AUTOEXEC files so they knowwhere to find the device drivers.andP;  For example, if you keep a device driverfor your VGA board in a hard disk subdirectory called DEVICES, yourCONFIG.SYS contains a line similar to this:andM;DEVICE=C:\DEVICES\VEGABIOS.SYS /M/128andM;If your boot floppy contains all the copies of device drivers in its rootdirectory, you must change the floppy's version of CONFIG.SYS so the linereads:andM;DEVICE=VEGABIOS.SYS / M /128andM;Make any other necessary changes in your AUTOEXEC file.andP;  If your FAT isscrambled, these precautions won't give you access to the files on your harddrive, but they'll at least allow you to boot your computer and configure therest of your hardware.andP;  If you're using a dual-hard-drive backup system, yourfloppy may allow you to get to the files on your second hard drive.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
