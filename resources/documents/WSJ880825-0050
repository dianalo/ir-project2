The IMF credit will complement $5.2 billion in new loans that Brazil negotiated with commercial banks earlier this month. The IMF board said it approved the standby loan when it became clear that Brazil had won a new vote of confidence from its commercial creditors.    The fund said Brazil may draw on the standby loan over a year-and-a-half period ending in February 1990. The loan would be designed to help Brazil with economic adjustments that it has vowed to undertake.    &quot;The (Brazilian) program seeks to create the conditions for sustained growth by reducing inflation, strengthening savings, and broadening the distribution of incomes,&quot; a spokesman for the IMF said.    Under the program, Brazil will allow market forces to play a greater role in its economy, the fund added. One of the country's goals is to reduce its government budget deficit to 4% of the country's gross national product from the current 5.5%.    Separately, Britain's Export Credit Guarantee Department said it resumed insuring medium-term export credits to Brazil, after Brazil's recent agreements with the IMF and the Paris Club.    The department suspended medium-term cover for Brazil in September 1983 because of payment difficulties. Cover on loans up to 180 days was maintained throughout, and was extended to loans up to 365 days in January 1988.    The department said earlier this month, just after Brazil reached a rescheduling accord with the Paris Club, that it expected to restore cover by October. </TEXT></DOC>
