McCloskey, (301) 443-1116.(This is not a toll free number). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>As a result of the April 22, 1977,decision of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in <T3>Tyndall </T3>v. <T3>U.S.</T3>, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is undercontinuing court order to apply the same definition of the term ``Indian''for purposes of Indian preference in employment in the IHS as that adoptedby the Department of the Interior (DOI) and to publish the definition asa regulation in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> within 30 days of the DOI's publication. Rulemaking procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.8553) generally involve publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking,affording interested persons the opportunity to comment, and publicationof the final rule after consideration of the comments received. However,in this case, no notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) is required. As aresult of the Court's order, the Department has no discretion in this matterand, therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 533(b)(B) the Department is waivingthe proposed rulemaking requirements. On July 11, 1978 (42 FR 29783), the HHS published a final rule which broughtthe definition of Indian for purposes of Indian preference in employmentin the IHS into conformance with the DOI definition published January 17,1978 (42 FR 2393). On July 17, 1981 (46 FR 37044, 45), on October 4, 1984(49 FR 39157), on September 15, 1986 (51 FR 32631, 32), and most recentlyJanuary 5, 1989 (54 FR 282), the DOI amended its definition to continuethe application of Indian preference to persons of the Osage Tribe of Oklahoma,who are at least one-quarter degree Indian ancestry. The HHS rule was revisedon November 4, 1981 (45 FR 54743), November 6, 1984 (49 FR 44288, 89),and July 24, 1987 to conform to the DOI's 1981 and 1984 and 1986 changes.The membership rolls of the Osage Tribe of Oklahoma, like a number of othertribes, were closed by an act of Congress, and therefore, these tribesdid not have current membership standards. The original regulation provideda 3-year period for such tribes to formally organize and establish membershipstandards and, in the interim, permitted persons of one quarter degreeblood of such tribes to qualify for Indian preference rather than havingto meet the normal one half degree requirement. This was extended threetimes to give the Osage Tribe additional time to establish membership standards.The new DOI regulation and this HHS revision again extend the expired datefor one final year from the date of publication of the extension rule.The quarter degree standard will remain applicable through January 4, 1990or until the Osage tribe has formally organized and established membershipstandards, whichever comes first. Under terms of the Court's order and our conforming regulations the IHShas been obligated to apply the revised DOI definition of Indian for purposesof employment uninterruptedly since 1978. The Department's definition varies slightly from that of the DOI in orderto clarify that there is no gap in the application of the definition topeople of Osage ancestry. People of Osage ancestry, who are employed bythe IHS and who received perference in any previous appointment, will continueto be preference eligibles so long as they are employed in HHS positionsgoverned by the Indian Preference Act. The Department of Health and Human Services has determined that this documentis not a major rule and does not require a regulatory analysis under ExecutiveOrder 12291.The Department of Health and Human Services has determined that this documentdoes not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities. This rule affects only persons of the Osage Tribe of Indians.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 42 CFR Part 36 </ITAG>Alaska natives, Employees, Eskimos, Government employees, Health, Indianpreference, and Indians. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 13, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James O.
