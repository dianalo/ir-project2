Atleast 13 people, including a policeman, were reported injured.   About 1,500 students attacked 3,000 police at Seoul's HanyangUniversity after authorities locked the school gates and refused forthe third day to allow anyone inside for protest rallies.   Waves of students climbed over school walls, throwing rocks andfirebombs and trying to break through police lines so about 1,000colleagues several blocks away could get inside the campus.   As the fighting continued, students from other colleges who hadassembled outside the campus raced through the streets and crawledover broken walls to gain entrance.   ``Drive out Yankees who block national unification!'' and``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo!'' the protesters yelled. Radical studentsare demanding the withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops stationed inSouth Korea and the ouster of President Roh Tae-woo.   Police threw back rocks and tear gas grenades, injuring at leasta dozen students. One policeman was seriously injured when tear gasexploded inside the armored van he was driving, authorities said.   The students were protesting a government ban on attending theJuly 1-8 World Youth Festival in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang.``Let's march to Pyongyang!'' they shouted.   In downtown Seoul, hundreds of students throwing firebombs androcks fought riot police, forcing shoppers to race for shelter.Traffic came to a halt and tear gas wafted through the air.   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said the downtown fightingstarted when about 700 students from three schools marched to thecity center.   The Seoul government has accused North Korea of using thefestival to stir up dissent in South Korea.   North Korea invited South Korean students to attend the youthfestival, an athletic and cultural festival mainly featuringnon-aligned and communist nations.   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the peninsula wasdivided into the communist North and the capitalist South at the endof World War II. The North invaded the South to begin the 1950-53Korean War.</TEXT></DOC>
