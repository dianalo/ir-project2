The federal governmentis beginning to show signs of wisdom (of all things) by admitting thatit isn't quite so smart, and that perhaps it doesn't have the plenarypower to strike these balances, to be a good regulator. But that isn'tthe end of it. Now the states must show us that they are willing to strivetoward bringing these disparate forces into an acceptable - and practical- equilibrium. They must deal with the same problems that confrontedthe federal regulators and, most important, they must strive toward thesame goal: effective regulation. Deregulation, and the things we associatewith it - more economic activity and jobs - is generally a very goodthing. And these things will be achieved in the era of a diminished federalregulatory presence. And remember, the federal government has got it'shands full with other worries - huge deficits in our federal budget andforeign trade; arms control; drugs; and international terrorism. In thisnew era the federal government will increasingly allow regulatory issuesto be resolved at other, more appropriate levels of government. The benefitsof what we call &quot;deregulation&quot; have already been seen, and the authorbelieves they will continue to be seen. The era into which we now mustgo will not be one of over-regulation, and it will not be one of no regulation;it will, however, be one of better regulation.</TEXT></DOC>
