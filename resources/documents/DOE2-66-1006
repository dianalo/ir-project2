Currently favored processes in the UnitedStaes are catalytic steam reforming for light hydrocarbons and partialoxidation and water shift for heavier hydrocarbons. Electrolysis of waterusing fossil-fuel generated electricity is the most expensive process,so its use is limited to small-quantity production of high purity hydrogen.Renewable hydrogen production technology options that were assessed includeelectrolysis using any available renewable source of electricity, suchas geothermal energy, wind, hydropower, direct solar radiation, biomass,and ocean thermal energy; all are now in some stage of development inHawaii. Other options are biomass gasification, steam reforming of biologicallygenerated methane, thermochemical decomposition of water, and variousphotoconversion methods.</TEXT></DOC>
