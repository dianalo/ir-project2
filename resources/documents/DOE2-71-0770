The detecting equipmenthas undergone three major developments during the past ten years: thesize of experiments has been increasing; for fixed-target experiments,this is a natural consequence of the larger momenta of particles involvedand the correspondingly larger lever arms for magnetic analysis required.Also, larger target masses were needed for reactions with small cross-section,as in neutrino physics. For storage ring detectors, the large size isdictated by the necessity to cover most of the 4{pi} solid angle aroundthe interaction point. The second development concerns the speed of dataacquisition: while pulsed devices like bubble or spark chambers werelimited to 1-10 recorded events per accelerator pulse, the inventionof proportional and drift chambers has increased this rate by a factorof 100 enabling experiments with 10/sup 8/ recorded events. In parallelwith this goes the third evolution: the increase in complexity of thedetectors. The number of independent analog informations from a largeexperiment can reach 10/sup 4/, and after digitization this yields upto 10/sup 5/ bits of information for one event from such a detector.Experiments of this type have become possible because the reliabilityof the equipment has increased considerably during this time and becausefast on-line computers enable permanent control and monitoring of thedetector. In spite of the complexity of large experiments, the basicprinciples of detectors are simple. In this article, the author goesthrough these principles and some of the newer developments, followingthe list of physical quantities measured by the detector: position, time,mass, energy and momentum.</TEXT></DOC>
