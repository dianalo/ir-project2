In Oregon, Gov. Neil Goldschmidt declared an emergency Wednesdaynight, clearing the way for deployment of the National Guard tohelp fight raging fires. Crews also struggled against blazes inIdaho, Washington and California.   The Boise Interagency Fire Center, which coordinatesfirefighting in the West and Alaska, said 66,000 fires haveblackened 3.3 million acres in drought-plagued 1988, 300,000 acresmore than in 1986, considered the region's worst year.   ``Obviously, we've got a wild year here,'' said spokeswomanBernie Pineda.   In Montana, fire broke out Wednesday afternoon a half-mile froma Minuteman II nuclear missile site between Great Falls andLewistown, the Air Force said.   The blaze more than doubled to 900 acres overnight, but ZailChapman, dispatcher for the Helena National Forest in Great Falls,said, ``The missile silo is completely secure.''   About 240 firefighters were in the area, and the fire wasexpected to be contained by tonight, he said.   Malmstrom Air Force Base at Great Falls sent military police andfirefighters to protect the silo Wednesday afternoon but withdrewthem during the night, Capt. Donald Planalp said this morning.   ``There is really nothing above ground that's flammable,''Planalp said.   Firefighters in Yellowstone hoped for continued low winds tohelp keep the 108,300-acre North Fork fire from moving the one mileto an evacuated campground and hotel complex. The fire grew 10,000acres overnight and expanded north into stands of pine, but did notget any closer to about cabins.   About 360 visitors were evacuated Wednesday as flames advancedto within 1{ miles of the Canyon compound.   ``It's a hassle,'' said visitor Pat Bentz of Prineville, Ore.``I just hope I don't have to go through this kind of thing again.''   The evacuation left only firefighters and reporters to contendwith the heavy smoke that obscured the sun and veiled views of the308-foot Lower Falls and 109-foot Upper Falls.   Ten fires involving 355,000 acres were burning in Yellowstone,closing five other campgrounds, the Grant Village hotel area andthe south entrance.   Firefighters at the 156,500-acre Clover-Mist fire innortheastern Yellowstone received aid from 635 soldiers from FortLewis, Wash., who took over mop-up work on the fire's east flank inthe Shoshone National Forest.   To the south in Grand Teton National Park and the Bridger-TetonNational Forest, firefighters planned to guide a 16,000-acre firetoward Yellowstone's southern border, where they hoped it wouldjoin two other blazes and consume all available fuel.   To the east, Bighorn National Forest officials hoped to containan 11,000-acre fire by tonight.   In southern Montana, about 600 more firefighters headed for the28,000-acre Storm Creek fire in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness.Management of the firefighting was handed over Wednesday to atop-level team from Alaska.   Commander Dave Liebersbach said the fire gained between 500 and1,000 acres on its southern flank Wednesday and was 4 miles fromCooke City, 3 miles closer than Tuesday.   He said a ridge separated the fire and the tourist communityjust outside Yellowstone's northeast gate. Officials said there wasa 10 percent to 20 percent chance the fire could cross the ridgetoday.   Southeast of Helena, crews neared containment of a 16-day-oldblaze that destroyed more than a dozen structures. Firefighters onWednesday began hand-burning the last troublesome area along firelines surrounding the 37,600-acre blaze. Officials predicted itwould be contained by Friday evening.   A raging fire on the steep slopes of Hells Canyon at theIdaho-Oregon line forced crews to move their base camp to escapethe flames. The fire mushroomed Wednesday from 1,200 acres to2,000, making a run into a stand of timber containing 12 millionboard feet of wood.   Oregon's state forester, James E. Brown, requested NationalGuard aircraft to help map the fires.   No ground troops were immediately called out in the governor'semergency order, which applied only to southwest Oregon.   A fire at Ward Canyon in northeastern Oregon grew to 2,000 acrestoday, forcing 220 firefighters to abandon the fight and considermoving their threatened camp.   About 200 firefighters also battled a 1,000-acre fire in CraterLake National Park and adjacent land.   A blaze at Walker Mountain northeast of Grants Pass burned 650acres by late Wednesday, and authorities drew up contingencyevacuation plans for residents.   Lightning storms Tuesday peppered southwestern Oregon, startingat least 60 fires.   In Washington state, winds whipped a fire seven miles northwestof Morton from 50 to 250 acres overnight, while more thanfirefighters worked to contain a nearby 500-acre blaze.   Near Cloverdale, Calif., about 65 miles north of San Francisco,a grass fire set off by a welder's torch burned a barn and charredsome 2,000 acres in steep terrain. The fire was advancing toward anearby subdivision.</TEXT></DOC>
