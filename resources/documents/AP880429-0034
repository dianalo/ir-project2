In a letter to Walsh, William Bradford Reynolds said Thursdayhis ``fleeting reference'' to the immunized congressional testimonyof fired National Security Council aide Oliver North in front ofone of Walsh's investigators was ``wholly inadvertent.''   Reynolds did not identify the testimony, but Justice Departmentsources say it concerns North's statements that he shreddedsensitive documents in the presence of Reynolds and another aide toAttorney General Edwin Meese III. Reynolds has publicly denied thatportion of North's testimony.   Reynolds said the mention of North's testimony was prompted by aquestion from the investigator, Judith Hetherton, an associatecounsel on the independent counsel's staff.   In testimony that Reynolds wrote he was ``startled to read,''Walsh said in federal court Wednesday at the pre-trial tainthearing in the Iran-Contra scandal that Hetherton had to use``forceful'' language to cut off Reynolds as he started to relatesome of North's testimony.   ``She really had to be energetic to get him to stop,'' testifiedWalsh.   Reynolds flatly rejected Walsh's characterization.   The exchange with Hetherton took a minute or two in normalconversational tones and ``neither of us interrupted ... neitherher language nor mine ever approached being `forceful' or evenremotely impolite,'' Reynolds said in the letter.   ``The fact is that my fleeting reference to something that cameup'' during North's congressional testimony last summer was inresponse to a question by Hetherton just before Reynolds'subsequent grand jury appearance, Reynolds wrote.   ``As soon as I answered, she advised me that I should notdiscuss with her or the grand jury any immunized congressionaltestimony and I instantly apologized, assuring her that myreference had been wholly inadvertent,'' said Reynolds, thecounselor to Meese.   By law, Walsh must convince the judge in the case that theindictments of North and three others was obtained independently ofimmunized congressional testimony.   North and two of the defendants in the case are trying to usetheir immunity grants as a way of getting the indictmentsdismissed. North, former national security adviser John Poindexter,retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and Albert Hakim,Secord's business partner, are under indictment for conspiracy,theft and fraud charges.   James Wieghart, a spokesman for Walsh, had no comment onReynolds' letter.   North testified that he shredded sensitive documents whileReynolds and another Meese aide, then-chief of staff JohnRichardson, were in North's office reviewing his files during aweekend inquiry in November 1986.   The inquiry led to the uncovering of the diversion to theContras of money from the Reagan administration's secret arms salesto Iran. North's testimony raised the suggestion of incompetence bythe attorney general's staff or of a possible cover-up to whichMeese's staff acquiesced.</TEXT></DOC>
