<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-20-0711 </DOCNO><TEXT>Basalts of the mid-Jurassic Gran Canon Formation, Cedros Island, Mexico,were emplaced on a volcaniclastic apron in a deep marine backarc basin.Elongate pillows and lava tubes, as well as paleocurrent data from thevolcaniclastic apron, indicate a southward regional paleoslope away fromthe island arc source. Basalts emplaced on relatively proximal partsof the apron are nearly entirely pillowed and have thick flow units withmega-pillows. Basalts on distal parts of the apron (about 15 to 20 kmdown paleo-current) are dominated by pillow fragment breccias (flow footrubble), and individual lava flows are generally thin, with small pillows,suggesting that the distal ends of lava flows, erupted upslope, are represented.These distal flow fronts, however, are interstratified with featuresthat typically form close to a vent, including thick massive to mega-pillowedlavas and lava tubes up to 8 m in diameter. It is inferred that a fissure(or system of fissures) extended from the arc into the backarc basin,erupting basalt lavas onto both proximal and distal parts of the volcaniclasticapron. Such intraplate volcanism may be common on the hot frontal arcside of backarc basins. 26 references.</TEXT></DOC>
