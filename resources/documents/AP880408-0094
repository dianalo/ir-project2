(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The mayor, two state legislators and 13other Mingo County political figures indicted by a grand jury usedbribes and illegal contributions to ``subvert the free electionsystem,'' a prosecutor said.   The state indictments Thursday followed federal indictmentscharging a police chief, a former fire chief and their familieswith openly running a drug ring protected by a web of bribes in themountain coal-mining county.   One state indictment charged state Sen. Truman Chafin withaccepting a bribe in 1982 when he was a county commissioner toassist in the sale of the sheriff's job for $100,000.   Another indictment accused 15 others of violating state electionlaws and conspiracy. They are accused of conspiring with Johnie M.Owens, the former sheriff and former county Democratic Partychairman, and others to influence elections in 1984 and 1986 andcounty law enforcement.   ``The indictment charges this group of people with attemptingbasically to subvert the free election system in Mingo County innumerous different acts and actions,'' Special Prosecutor JamesColburn said.   ``They conspired ... by illegal campaign contributions, byillegal campaign expenditures, by bribery, by false accounting, andby conspiring to do all these things,'' he said.   Colburn emphasized that the indictments were a warning to otherpoliticians who might use political slates to further theirpositions. ``I believe that if one reviews the statutes, one cansee a lot of slate activity violates West Virginia law,'' Colburnsaid.   Among those named in a 10-count indictment were state Sen. JohnPat Fanning, county Prosecutor W. Thomas Ward, Williamson Mayor SamKapourales, and County Commissioners Steve Adkins and Ronald Rumora.   The indictment alleges they ``associated together with Johnie M.Owens and others to improperly affect and influence the freeelection system and the law enforcement system of Mingo County.''   The indictment lists five felonies and five misdemeanors, butsome counts do not apply to all defendants.   Also named as defendants were Mingo County county school boardmembers Paul Sizemore and Robert Simpkins, former state DelegatesJames B. Simpkins, Irvine K.O. Damron, and R. Doyle Van Meter II,former county Magistrate Joey Kohari, Magistrate Bill Webb, formerCircuit Clerk Robert J. ``Jack'' Webb, former County Clerk HughWellman, and Larry Hamrick, a former school board member.   Also indicted was Goodwill Motors Inc., a used car dealership atDelbarton owned by former county commissioner and former countyDemocratic Chairman Stewart Justice. Justice was not named as adefendant.   The defendants are scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday in countyCircuit Court.   Some defendants said they were surprised by the indictment,which was the result of several investigations spanning more thantwo years. ``I've tried all my life to live a decent life, andsomething like this is quite a shock,'' Robert Simpkins said.   Chafin denied any wrongdoing.   ``As I have said time and time again, I had nothing to do withany sale of the Mingo County sheriff's office,'' he said. ``Ireceived no money or benefit as a result of this transaction. ...This matter will be finally resolved in a court of law. Until thenI have no further comment.''   Ward was not at his office and could not be reached for comment,and Kapourales refused to comment when contacted by telephoneThursday. Fanning was at neither his home nor his office today.   Hamrick, who is awaiting sentencing after admitting to feloniesinvolving the misuse of county funds, eferred all questions to hislawyers.   ``I can't make any comment,'' Hamrick said. ``I'm in federalcustody.''   Kohari said he had not seen a copy of the indictment, but added,``I have nothing to be ashamed of.''   The federal grand jury indicted several current and formerofficials in the alleged sale of the sheriff's office to currentSheriff Charles ``Eddie'' Hilbert in 1982.   The joint federal-state probe began two years ago wheninvestigators discovered drugs being sold so freely in Kermit, aMingo County town of 700, that undercover officers were able tophotograph a ``No Drugs Today'' sign posted outside a trailer.   So far, the investigation has netted more than 50 convictions orguilty pleas, with no acquittals.   Hilbert was indicted in January on 13 felony counts, includingcharges that he helped protect a drug ring operated by then-KermitFire Chief Wilburn ``Wig'' Preece and Preece's family.   Among those serving sentences of up to 16 years for operatingthe ring are Preece; his wife, Virginia; their son-in-law, formerPolice Chief David Ramey; and their four sons and two of theirdaughters. A third daughter was placed on probation.   Owens and former Commissioner Rastie Runyon have pleaded guiltyand will be sentenced April 18, the same day Hilbert is scheduledto enter a plea as part of an agreement with prosecutors. Adkins isawaiting trial.</TEXT></DOC>
