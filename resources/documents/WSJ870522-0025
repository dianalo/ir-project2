In the Treasury market yesterday, prices of actively traded long-term issues rose about 1/8 point, or $1.25 for each face $1,000 amount. Prices of many other Treasury issues, corporate and municipal bonds closed unchanged.    The dollar's relative weakness has been one of the catalysts driving the credit markets in recent months. In particular, investor fears of inflation stemming from the dollar's decline have resulted in the current yawning gap between short-term and long-term interest rates, many economists contend. The widening of the so-called yield curve suggests pressure is building for higher short-term interest rates, including bank prime lending rates, they add.    &quot;The fear of inflation is totally justified while short-term rates remain relatively low,&quot; said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;Unless there's a significant tightening of monetary policy and higher short-term rates, bond yields are likely to rise significantly higher.&quot;    At the moment, the latest 30-year Treasury bond yields nearly 3 1/2 percentage points more than the rate on the three-month Treasury bill. While the benchmark long-term bond yield spurted 1 1/2 percentage points to just over 9% from 7.55% in late March, the current 5.51% rate on three-month bills actually declined about 0.1 percentage point.    In contrast, the gap between 30-year government bonds and short-term government bills was less than 1.4 percentage points a year ago. At that point, rates on the benchmark 30-year bond and three-month bill were 7.52% and 6.15%, respectively.    The widening of the yield curve &quot;traditionally has signaled a loose monetary policy and expectations of higher inflation,&quot; said Mr. Kudlow. There are other measures, such as surging bank credit and bank reserves compiled by the Federal Reserve, that &quot;strongly suggest we are witnessing a relatively easy monetary stance amid a sudden surge in inflation,&quot; he contended.    The relatively low rate on three-month Treasury bills partly is the result of large Treasury cash balances in recent weeks as well as continued strong demand for government bills, the shortest-term, highest-quality securities available. The demand was strengthened in recent days by jitters over Citicorp's projected $2.5 billion second-quarter loss.    &quot;The real yield curve&quot; is the current 1.06 percentage point interest rate gap between two-year and 30-year government bonds, said Paul F. Jacobson, a partner and co-head of government securities trading at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;And that's perfectly normal,&quot; he contended. &quot;We seem to be getting pretty close to yield levels where investors think they're being compensated for the fear of rising inflation.&quot;    Nevertheless, with many economists predicting a 5% annual inflation rate this year, the real, or inflation-adjusted return on three-month Treasury bills now is running below 1%, compared with almost 5% a year ago, when inflation was about 2.5%.    &quot;The pressure clearly is building for a full percentage point rise in Treasury bill rates,&quot; said Arnold X. Moskowitz, a senior vice president and financial strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. &quot;That includes further increases&quot; in banks' prime lending rates, he predicted, &quot;before the inflation bubble bursts.&quot;    Meantime, inflation likely will remain the main force directing bond prices in the months ahead, traders and analysts say.    Investors confront an immediate inflation hurdle in this morning's report of the consumer price index for April. The index is expected to show a rise of 0.5% last month, according to the average forecast of nine economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. In March and February, the index rose 0.4%.    In yesterday's market activity, the Federal Reserve added reserves to the banking system in a move that many economists said wasn't part of any shift in monetary policy. The action came when the rate on federal funds, the reserves banks lend each other overnight, was 6 3/4%.    In the government bond market, the Treasury's 8 3/4% bonds due 2017 rose to 96 28/32 from 96 26/32 Tuesday, as the yield declined to 9.05% from 9.06% Wednesday. The government's 8 1/2% notes due 1997 climbed to 97 17/32 from 97 10/32 to yield 8.878%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. rose 0.73 point to 1241.59. It ranged between 1251.43 and 1240.58.    Among short-term rates, the federal funds rate averaged 6.77% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. The funds rate averaged 6.6% Tuesday.    The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bills declined to 5.51% from 5.62% Wednesday. Six-month Treasury bills fell to 6.1% from 6.16% Wednesday.    In the municipal new-issue market, a $65 million issue of Austin, Texas, utility system revenue bonds was offered to investors. Underwriters led by Prudential-Bache Capital Funding priced the bonds after auction with yields ranging from 6.65% for bonds due 1989-2002 to 8.625% for bonds due 2012 and 2017. The offering appeared to be well-received as underwriters reported an unsold balance of $4.5 million. </TEXT></DOC>
