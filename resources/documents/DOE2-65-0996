<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-65-0996 </DOCNO><TEXT>Highly reliable AlGaAs lasers with dry etched mirrors are successfullyfabricated with a novel ultrahigh vacuum in situ processing system, equippedwith reactive ion beam etching (RIBE) and dielectric film depositionchambers. Etched mirror surfaces are protected against air-exposure contaminationand nonvolatile reaction products adsorption with the in situ Al/sub2/O/sub 3/ passivation subsequent to the Cl/sub 2/ RIBE mirror formation.Ion bombardment-induced damage is repaired by thermal annealing, andthe annealing effect is markedly enhanced by a contamination-free interfacebetween the etched mirror surface and Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ passivation film.Improved lasers exhibit increase in catastrophic optical damage (COD)level and long-life operation. Their COD levels are twice as high asthat for as-etched lasers and are almost the same as those for conventionalcleaved lasers. In situ Auger analyses on the etched surface are performedto investigate the improvement of the laser characteristics.</TEXT></DOC>
