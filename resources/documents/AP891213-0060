A postal union official said Tuesday the ruling would provideammunition in the fight against a Postal Service policy, institutedthis year, that screens prospective employees for past drug use.   ``We read the decision as impacting the (Postal Service's)current drug testing program,'' William Burrus, executive vicepresident of the American Postal Workers Union, said fromWashington. ``We see it as extremely important. We hope to expandits reach nationwide.''   The case focused specifically on a research project begun in1986 by the Postal Service, in which job applicants in Bostonsubmitted to drug tests, and the results were compared with theemployees' job performance after they were hired.   In his ruling, U.S. District Judge John McNaught said the testsviolate constitutional rights against unreasonable searches andseizures because the government has failed to show a compellingreason for testing prospective employees.   ``I conclude that the required urinalysis drug testing for alljob applicants to the United States Postal Service withoutindividualized suspicion is an unreasonable intrusion into theprivacy of applicants and thus, a violation of the FourthAmendment,'' McNaught said in his decision.   James Lamond, the attorney representing the local AmericanPostal Workers Union in the case, said the decision marked thefirst time a public sector drug-testing program for job applicantshad been struck down by a U.S. district judge.   Gene Guerrero, who follows drug-testing issues for the AmericanCivil Liberties Union in Washington, said he was unaware of anyother rulings against government drug testing programs for jobapplicants.   Joel Prosch, assistant postmaster general for employeerelations, said no decision had been made whether to appeal thejudge's ruling. But he stressed that the case was limited to theresearch project in Boston.   According to court documents, job applicants were required tosubmit to a urinalysis for drug testing starting in September 1986.   ``It was done purely for research purposes,'' said KarenIntrater, an attorney for the Postal Service. ``It had nothing todo with the hiring process.''   If the tests results were positive, the applicants could stillbe hired, and they would be monitored for absenteeism, disciplineproblems and other factors.   The data collection in the study ended earlier this year, butthe results have not yet been published, Intrater said.   The program was challenged by the local postal carriers union.McNaught issued his ruling Nov. 21, but the decision was just madepublic this week.</TEXT></DOC>
