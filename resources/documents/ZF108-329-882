 The model, developed by IBM scientist Roger Traub andColumbia University researchers Richard Miles and Robert K.S.andP;  Wong, wasdesigned to imitate 10,000 cells in the brain's hippocampus, the origin ofmany epileptic episodes.andP;  The most startling aspect of these waves is that noone understands precisely how they are generated either by the supercomputermodel or by the brain.andP;  However, their existence does does provide thescientists with potent evidence their brain model is accurate.andM;COMPETITIVE EDGE...The maturation of the computer industry and the escalationof foreign competition have placed U.S.andP;  computer firms at a turning point.andO;Participants at a recent National Research Council forum warn thatmaintaining U.S.andP;  preeminence in computing at the beginning of the nextcentury will require a level of planning, leadership, and collective will&quot;that cannot be attained with a business-as-usual approach by industry andgovernment.&quot;andM;STOP THE PRESSES...Boxed announcement on the front page of the New YorkTimes, February 28, 1990: &quot;Because of a malfunction in the Times newsroomcomputers, a number of articles may be missing from this edition, orincomplete.andP;  Printing of some copies was also delayed.andP;  (We) regret theinconvenience to our readers.&quot;andM;FLOOD ALERT...A $ 1.1 million ComputerWorld Smithsonian award has beenpresented to the U.S.andP;  Corps of Engineers for their work in creating aflood-detecting computer network for the Passaic River (N.J.) basin.andP;  TheWide Area Network Data Acquisition (WANDA) and Data Command is a controltelemetry system that monitors and collects data via sensors embeddedthroughout the basin.andP;  The network allows flood predictions to be made hoursbefore the event.andP;  In 1984, four people were killed and $370 million inproperty was destroyed by a Passaic River basin flood.andM;BUDGETARY BOOST...The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)FY 1991 budget request of $198.4 million represents a $36.5 million increaseover its current appropriation.andP;  Indeed, it would be the largest singleincrease since the agency's inception.andP;  According to NIST Acting DirectorRaymond Kammer, the agency's appropriated budget has stayed essentially flatover the past 15 years, while U.S.andP;  industry and government Randamp;D budgetsincreased dramatically.andP;  &quot;We are still operating on a budget from 1975,&quot; saysKammer.andP;  &quot;These requested increases are long overdue.&quot;andM;EVEN STEVEN...In the race to commercialize superconductivity, the U.S.andP;  andJapan are running at the same pace.andP;  According to attendees at last month'sAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science meeting, both nations arespending about $250 million per year on research, and both have madesubstantial progress in different areas.andP;  The U.S.andP;  is focusing on smallelectronic devices while Japan is concentrating on larger projects likesuperfast trains run by magnetic power.andM;CODING L.A...As if Los Angeles does not have enough traffic problems, nowcomes word that cellular phones, computer modems, fax machines and otherhigh-tech devices requiring call numbers are jamming the city's phone lines.andO;Relief for these communication clogs will not come until February 1992 whenL.A.andP;  becomes the first U.S.andP;  city with three separate area codes.andM;STITCH IN TIME...Two Georgia colleges are experimenting with computer uses inindustrial sewing machine environments.andP;  A recent New York Times articleclaims a number of the state's clothing makers are testing the stitchingflexibility of computerized systems designed by Southern College ofTechnology and Georgia Institute of Technology.andP;  Early feedback indicatesthat specialized computer chips can be programmed to allow one machine toperform several different jobs.andP;  One clothier claims the new technology mightcut labor forces as much as 20 percent in some plants.andM;LEGAL MANEUVERS...Those wily West German hackers (who helped make CliffStoll--Communications, May 1988--a bestselling author) were handed suspendedsentences along with their court convictions.andP;  Judge Leopold Spiller saidalthough the trio purposely sold computer codes for money, &quot;it could not beproven that substantial damage had been done&quot; to the nation or its NATOpartners.andP;  In other crime news, a sentencing date for Robert T. Morris hasbeen slated for May 4.andM;TAX EXPERT...In an effort to live down last year's embarrassing statistics(answering one of every three questions incorrectly), the IRS has installedan experimental expert system hotline in Boston to help operators answertaxpayers' inquiries correctly.andP;  The IRS hopes this phone system, which usesa set of computer-generated questions and responses, will help operatorsextract what the caller is really asking.andP;  IRS officials blame confusion overthe nature of calls for their poor performance last tax season.andM;WHEN IN ROME...When it comes to copyright protection, U.S.andP;  softwareprogrammers and vendors are being pushed to the glasnost limits.andP;  Accordingto ComputerWorld, duplicating copyrighted software in the U.S.S.R.andP;  isconsidered resourceful, not criminal.andP;  Copyright laws there simply do notcover software, which is why U.S.andP;  vendors estimate the Soviet Union iscurrently using hundreds of millions of dollars worth of pirated U.S.andO;programs.andP;  One early solution, however, may be the recent Pereslaval-Zaleskyagreement, a code of ethics established jointly by a group of U.S.andP;  andSoviet programmers.andM;H-E-R-E'S RAY...The world's first computer-generated primetime co-host willmake his TV debut this fall.andP;  Ray Tracy, a 3-D creation from LosAngeles-based Digital Vision Entertainment, will appear in the first film toemploy human performers to interact with computer-animated characters.andO;&quot;Computer Visions,&quot; will take viewers on a behind-the-scenes journey into theweird world of computer animation and artificial reality.andP;  SaysProducer/Director Geoffrey de Valois: &quot;Within a few years we will be able tocreate computer-generated actors who will look so real, they will be almostindistinguishable from human actors.&quot;andP;  That's show biz...andO;</TEXT></DOC>
