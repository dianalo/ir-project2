Hit by record low prices for crucial January spot salesand February futures transactions, a few producers last weekabruptly announced they would limit production. Theirdoubtful strategy: Strengthen prices by limiting supply.</LP><TEXT>   Prices are &quot;ridiculous,&quot; complained Robert J. Allison Jr.,chairman and chief executive officer of Anadarko PetroleumCorp. in Houston. He's turning off the well valves to trimFebruary production by 150 million cubic feet a day. But toactually influence prices, the industry would have to slashproduction by at least two billion cubic feet a day, or about4% of the U.S. total, analysts said.   The apparent futility of Anadarko's action underscores thefrustration of many producers. &quot;We cannot and will not giveaway our stockholders' long-term assets&quot; at current prices,said Mr. Allison.   The dilemma for such companies: sell gas at a loss orclose wells, possibly forgoing revenue needed to sustain someoperations. Last week's prices to producers hovered slightlyabove $1 per thousand cubic feet, less than half the price inJanuary 1990. Many energy analysts had forecast pricesexceeding $1.50 for this month.   All this touched off a new round of forecasts of layoffsand producer bankruptcies. Vinod Dar, a gas industryconsultant in Washington, estimates the 5,000 current U.S.producers may be trimmed to 2,500 in the next two years andthat the industry may lose 25,000 jobs by the late 1990s.Analysts are lowering their first-quarter earnings estimatesfor many producers.   &quot;The domestic exploration industry is in meltdown,&quot; saidRaymond Plank, chairman and chief executive of Apache Corp.in Denver. Apache said last week that it will reduce its gassales in February by about 100 million cubic feet a day onthe spot market.   Plains Resources Inc. in Houston said Friday that it wouldconsider sales of natural gas at present prices to be &quot;awaste of company assets.&quot; The company vowed to slash sales onthe spot market in February.   Mitchell Energy andamp; Development Corp., Woodlands, Texas,said it won't sell gas for less than $1.50 per thousand cubicfeet, widely considered a break-even price by producers. &quot;Wejust can't find gas for less than that price, so why sellit?&quot; said Chairman George Mitchell. But he conceded that thepolicy &quot;hurts cash flow.&quot;   Complaints about prices and temporary closings of wellsduring the summer aren't uncommon in the gas industry; butproducers count on the November-through-February period fortwo-thirds of their profit, analysts say. &quot;That makes thisprice collapse especially painful,&quot; said Robin Shoemaker, ananalyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. &quot;Now we have weak demandin the winter as well as in the summer.&quot;   Many gas industry officials had hoped that demand thiswinter would counter the record low summer prices of 1991.Some producers say that this winter hasn't been cold enough.   &quot;But we've had a real winter in many parts of thecountry,&quot; said Mr. Dar, the industry consultant. &quot;You can'tblame warm weather for February futures prices being belowthose of last April.&quot; In fact, the National Weather Servicesays that although this winter will probably prove warmerthan normal in the northern U.S., it will be colder in theSoutheast.   Mr. Dar said that natural-gas prices reflect a supply glutand the emergence of some producers who are taking advantageof tax credits for newly discovered fuel that allow them toprofit while discounting. &quot;If someone else is selling gas for$1, you can't get $2 for yours,&quot; he reasoned.   The level of U.S. gas in storage is actually 5% lower thana year ago, down to about three trillion cubic feet,according to John Olson, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.But that's still enough to supply the entire nation for about50 days, compared with a 60-day inventory a year ago, hesaid. It will take a far bigger dent in that stored supply tospur prices, he said.   Worse for the industry, it's widely known among big gascustomers such as utilities and corporations that newpipelines adding a collective two billion cubic feet ofnatural gas capacity to the nation's supply system areexpected to come on line in the next few weeks.   &quot;Thus, more gas will be available faster. Metaphorically,this is just toxic waste to other producers who must competeagainst it,&quot; said Mr. Olson. The new capacity will come online just as the nation's gas demand traditionally starts todrop from 70 billion cubic feet a day in February to 38billion in June.   The price slump is even eroding the earnings of major oilcompanies who have big natural-gas operations. On Friday,Exxon Corp. cited natural gas prices in the U.S. as animportant factor in its 28% slide in fourth-quarter netincome. Mobil Corp. cited lower natural gas prices as well aslower oil prices in explaining its 38% drop in the fourthquarter. Those companies' year-earlier profits also reflecteda run-up in energy prices before the Persian Gulf War.   The 1990s were supposed to be a golden era for the gasindustry. Repeated threats of oil shortages, ever-tougherpollution laws and federal tax credits for certainexploration costs seemed to guarantee that gas would becomethe dominant fossil fuel. Instead, the industry's share ofthe $240 billion energy market slipped to 24% in 1990 from33% in 1970, and high-polluting coal bit off big chunks ofbusiness from relatively clean-burning gas.   Many utilities built coal-fired power plants in the 1980sin reaction to federal legislation of the late 1970s,inspired by then-President Jimmy Carter and since repealed,that discouraged utilities' use of gas to preserve what wasthen considered a limited supply. Although many of the newerpower plants can burn gas too, many utilities prefer coalbecause coal suppliers agree to long-term contracts that gasproducers avoid. Says a Mitchell Energy official, &quot;We'd putourselves out of business with long-term contracts at today'sprices.&quot;   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Grains                                                                                                          Weather considerations and anticipation of PresidentBush's State of the Union address will dominate grain futurestrading this week.   The soybean-growing regions of southern Brazil have seensustained dryness. With the soybean crop entering itsweather-sensitive pod-filling stage, the crop needs rainsoon. More dryness would be likely to damage the crop andexert upward pressure on soybean futures prices.   The South African corn crop has been suffering undersimilarly parched conditions that if sustained could push upcorn futures prices.   And traders will be watching to see whether the presidentmentions the possibility of additional aid to the formerSoviet Union in his address.                                                                                                          Precious Metals                                                                                                          Trading in silver and platinum will be affected by how thepresident's State of the Union address tomorrow influencesperceptions about the economy, said Jeff Nichols, the BocaRaton, Fla., publisher of Metals Fax, an industry newsletter.   If the president makes proposals that people believe willboost the economy, the improved sentiment should helpindustrial metals such as silver and platinum, he said.   Gold has been under pressure from an unusual flow ofsupply entering the market in recent weeks, Mr. Nichols said.Speculation on the source has centered on possible sales byEastern European central banks or by Abu Dhabi, he said.   There was also talk that the gold had been collateral forSoviet credit agreements called swaps. Comments by Russianofficials about the republic's difficulties in servicing debtsuggest it may have been a bigger seller of gold, as well asplatinum, than was previously thought, Mr. Nichols said.   Recent weak platinum prices and higher platinum leaserates are consistent with platinum swaps being paid off or,in the case of a default, the collateral being sold, he said.In swaps, the platinum is deposited with the lender, who inturn leases the metal out. When the swap is paid off, thecollateral is returned; in the case of a default, the metalis sold. In both cases, the metal isn't available for lease,which when large amounts are involved could cause lease ratesto rise.   The gold and platinum sales aren't likely to continue inthe long run, Mr. Nichols said, but it isn't clear yetwhether they've run their course.                                                                                                          Copper                                                                                                          Traders are beginning to view non-ferrous metals such ascopper more optimistically, said Mike Frawley, metals traderat Dean Witter. Demand is beginning to improve, particularlyfrom Asia, and copper users are working off lean inventories,he said. On Friday, copper for March delivery ended at 98.9cents a pound, up 1.9 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
