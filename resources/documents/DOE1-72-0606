From these formfactor data the ground state charge density and its RMS radius (2.612+-0.009fm) were determined. This charge density as well as its difference withthat of /sup 16/O were compared to recent large-basis shell-model calculations.Although these calculations describe the individual charge density reasonably,the difference between /sup 16/O and /sup 15/N cannot be reproduced satisfactorily.(orig.)</TEXT></DOC>
