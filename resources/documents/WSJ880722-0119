Mr. Grady succeeds the union's longtime top lawyer, John Climaco, effective immediately.    Mr. Grady, 54 years old, is a partner in Grady andamp; Dwyer in Boston, where Teamsters President William McCarthy, elected last week, was international vice president. Mr. Grady, a labor lawyer for 28 years, has represented the union nationally and in matters affecting its New England regional council and some locals.    In the election for president, Mr. Climaco had backed Mr. McCarthy's opponent, Weldon Mathis, the union's secretary-treasurer, to succeed Jackie Presser, who died July 9. Mr. McCarthy's victory partly reflected discontent among some board members with the union's leadership in recent months under Messrs. Mathis and Climaco.    Mr. Climaco has been at the forefront of the union's defense against a suit filed recently by the Justice Department. The suit alleges Teamster ties to organized crime and seeks to oust top officials. Although Mr. Grady is currently representing the union in all matters, he said in an interview that it is undecided whether Mr. Climaco may play a role in defending the Teamsters in the government suit.    Mr. Climaco declined to comment on being replaced or on whether he might be retained to represent the union in the government action. </TEXT></DOC>
