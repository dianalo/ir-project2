Two bombs exploded inSyrian-controlled areas.   The crisis threatened to formally partition the tinyMediterranean nation along sectarian lines and rekindle the 13-yearcivil war, which killed 150,000 people.   Syria's Al-Thawra daily, which speaks for President HafezAssad's government, branded the Christian Cabinet of Army CommanderGen. Michel Aoun a ``military coup d'etat against legitimacy.''   ``This government not only constitutes a coup against legitimatestate institutions and laws, but it is also a coup against thehistoric chance to elect a new president and pave the way fornational reconciliation and salvation,'' it said in an editorial.   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, backs the five-manCabinet of Sunni Moslem Prime Minister Salim Hoss, which includesthe two main Moslem militia chieftains, Druse warlord WalidJumblatt and Shiite leader Nabih Berri.   The Syrians maintain an estimated 40,000 troops in north andeast Lebanon as well as in Moslem areas of Beirut. With their Druseand Shiite allies, they control 70 percent of the country. Lebanonhas 4,036 square miles and 4 million people.   Police said attackers fired a rocket-propelled grenade into ahotel in Syrian-controlled Moslem west Beirut during the night,gutting an unoccupied third floor room.   An hour later, a dynamite bomb exploded near a Syrian armycheckpoint a block from the hotel, police reported. No one wasinjured in either attack.   Firemen quickly put out the fire at the heavily guarded BristolHotel, where Robert Franjieh, son of Syrian-backed former PresidentSuleiman Franjieh, has been staying since his father announced hiscandidacy in Lebanon's abortive presidential election.   An aide said the younger Franjieh left his fourth floor suitefor the family's summer resort of Ehden in north Lebanon hoursbefore the grenade attack.   No one claimed responsibility for either incident. But they anda string of bombings and attacks on Syrian forces over the lastyear appeared to be aimed at discrediting Syria's peacekeeping rolein west Beirut.   The deadlock stemmed from Parliament's failure to elect asuccessor to President Amin Gemayel before his six-year termexpired at midnight Thursday.   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, was named prime minister by Gemayelminutes before his term ended.   Hoss' Cabinet is all that remains of a national government underGemayel, a Maronite. But that administration, fractured alongsectarian lines, rarely even consulted with him and had not held afull session for years.   The Moslem leaders had threatened to declare a breakaway statein territory controlled by their militias if Gemayel handed overpower to a Christian-led Cabinet.   Under an unwritten covenant, Lebanon's president must be aChristian, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the Parliamentspeaker a Shiite Moslem.   ``Alas, this appears to be it,'' lamented Beirut'sMoslem-controlled Voice of the Nation radio station. ``Unless a newpresident is quickly elected, and this seems to need a miracle,Lebanon is irrevocably partitioned.''   Parliament failed three times from Aug. 18 up to Gemayel'sdeparture to elect his successor because militant Christiansrejected two Syrian-backed candidates, Suleiman Franjieh, a closefriend of Assad, and parliamentary deputy Mikhail Daher.   Hoss became acting premier after Prime Minister Rashid Karami, aSunni, was assassinated in a bomb explosion aboard an armyhelicopter in June 1987.   On Saturday, Aoun's three-man Cabinet ordered civil servants notto take any orders from the Hoss government.   Hoss said in a statement broadcast Sunday by Moslem radiostations: ``Gen. Aoun's Cabinet is illegal and unconstitutional.Therefore it cannot issue orders or directives to anyone.''   But Aoun appeared bent on pressing his quest for recognition. Hecalled all the Arab ambassadors in Lebanon to meet him Monday atthe presidential palace in suburban Baabda, northeast of Beirut.</TEXT></DOC>
