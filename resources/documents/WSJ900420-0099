The joint report comes amid renewed congressional debateover whether to repeal or change the sanctions, which imposecivil and criminal penalites on employers who knowingly hireundocumented workers. In essence, the law requires employersto police job applicants by obtaining proof of their legalstatus.</LP><TEXT>   In their report, the economic and policy research groupsestimated that sanctions have reduced the flow of illegalimmigrants by less than 20%, thus failing to produce thelarge declines predicted by some advocates of the law. But ifthe intent of the law was to curb any increase in illegalimmigration, the sanctions could be viewed as successful.   The study also found that sanctions apparently haven'tcaused a large decline in the availability of illegalworkers. The researchers analyzed labor market data tomeasure wage change in certain occupations that traditionallyemploy many undocumented immigrants.   &quot;Congress may wish to weigh the cost of continuing theprogram against its current level of effectiveness,&quot; theresearchers said. The study was compiled by economists KeithW. Crane, Beth H. Asch and authors Joanna Zorn Heilbrunn andDanielle Cullinane, who analyzed data on border crossings,U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions, labor markets and otherindicators.   A congressional review of the sanctions was triggeredMarch 29 by a General Accounting Office study, which foundthe law has caused &quot;widespread discrimination&quot; against legaljob applicants who appear &quot;foreign.&quot; A hearing of the SenateSubcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs is scheduledfor today in Washington to discuss the issue.   Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), the subcommittee'schairman, has introduced legislation to expeditecongressional consideration of any changes or termination ofthe sanctions. Many organizations have called for thesanctions to be repealed, including the American BarAssociation, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. CivilRights Commission.   &quot;Many people saw sanctions as a panacea that would correctall immigration-related problems,&quot; said Mario Moreno of theMexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund inWashington, one of the groups lobbying for a repeal. &quot;Butthey're not effective, and Congress is forcing immigrationreform on the backs of the Hispanic and Asian communities.&quot;   The Immigration and Naturalization Service contends thatthe law has been successful in reducing illegal immigration.&quot;Have we been able to totally regain control of the border?No, we haven't,&quot; said Duke Austin, an INS spokesman. &quot;But thelaw clearly has been effective.&quot;   The INS expects to apprehend about one million personsalong the southern border in fiscal 1990, Mr. Austin said.That compares with the 1.7 million apprehended in 1986, theyear the law passed.   Other groups and lawmakers such as Sen. Alan Simpson (R.,Wyo.), a sponsor of the 1986 law, have argued that sanctionsshould not be repealed. Some have suggested that more fundingbe allocated to educate employers about the law, particularlythe anti-discrimination provisions.   The Urban Institute is based in Washington, D.C.
