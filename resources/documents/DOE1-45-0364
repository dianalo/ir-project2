The sharp separation of carbondioxide from sulfurous compounds achieved by TPC makes TPC an attractiveprocess to increase the hydrogen sulfide concentration of acid gas streamsproduced by other acid gas removal processes. TPC, together with CNGsulfurous compound absorption with liquid carbon dioxide, can improvethe economics of conventional Claus sulfur recovery processes and achieveessentially zero emission of sulfurous compounds.</TEXT></DOC>
