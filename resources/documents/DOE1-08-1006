From these, the internal mobilitiesof Li/sup +/ and K/sup +/ have been calculated. Except at a region ofrelatively high concentration of Li/sub 2/CO/sub 3/, the Chemla effectoccurs, that is, the mobility of the large cation K/sup +/ is greaterthat of the small one Li/sup +/. The internal mobilities of Li/sup +/ions are well expressed by bsub(Li) = [A/(V - Vsub(o))] exp ( - E/RT),where A, Vsub(o) and E are constants characteristic of the cation andindependent of temperature T, V the molar volume of mixtures, and R thegas constant. Negative deviations from this equation at a small V regionmay be attributed to the free space effect. For bsub(K) such a simpleequation does not hold over an extended region of concentration, whichsuggests that the agitation effect and the free space effect would alsoplay a role for the mobility.</TEXT></DOC>
