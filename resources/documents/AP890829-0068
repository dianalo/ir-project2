Claude Pepper.   ``Normally, when the polls open we might have one person waitingto vote. Today at that time, there were five,'' said HermanWeissman, a veteran election inspector at one Miami Beach pollingplace.   At 11 a.m., based on initial results from polls, the electionsdepartment was projecting that 42.8 percent of eligible voters wouldturn out, far higher than normal for a special election.   Voting was heaviest in the Cuban-American precints whereRepublican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen was strongest, with central LittleHavana residents turning out a projected 77.3 percent clip.   By contrast, North Miami Beach condominium precincts, whereDemocrat Gerald Richman has the advantage, were projected to have a46.3 percent turnout.   `It's been a very controversial election,'' Elections SupervisorDavid Leahy said. ``There has been a tremendous amount of mediaexposure, and we think both camps are getting a lot more people outto vote.''   Many Cuban-Americans were upset by the tone of the Richman'scampaign. His early slogan was ``This is an American Seat.''   Richman's defenders said he had been unfairly labeled asprejudiced, and said the campaign phrase was merely Richman's answerto Republican claims that the seat should belong to a Cuban-American.   The Fair Campaign Practices Committee, an independent panel,criticized both candidates as appealing to voter prejudice, blastingMs. Ros-Lehtinen for a Spanish-language brochure that it said made aveiled ethnic attack on Richman, a Jew.   ``No, we weren't born in Brooklyn, N.Y., like him. No, we don'tspeak English the same way he does ... We, too, are Americans,''said the brochure. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen has refused to debate Richman,calling him a bigot.   She campaigned Monday with Sen. Connie Mack among senior citizensin Miami Beach _ an area heavily favored to back her Democraticopponent.   Richman spent part of the day before the election in Miami Beach,and also visited with black ministers in Miami.   Polls last week indicated the race was too close to call and thatmost voters in the diverse district would choose ethnic heritage,not partisanship, at the ballot box.   The area Pepper represented for 27 years, until his death May 30at age 88, has 100,149 registered Democrats, 71,295 registeredRepublicans and 14,098 independents.   Blacks make up 19 percent of the district's registered voters.More than 40 percent of the district's registered voters areHispanic, and the rest are non-Latin whites, sometimes known locallyas``Anglos.''   Richman, 48, the Brooklyn-born former Florida Bar Associationpresident, hoped for a strong turnout from the traditionalJewish-retiree-black Democratic coalition, a group that has seen itstraditional power in the area eroded by the Latin influx into SouthFlorida.   A large turnout was expected from Cuban-Americans seeking to makeMs. Ros-Lehtinen, 37, the first Cuban-American elected to Congress.South Florida also has a growing population of Nicaraguans.   Leahy said that 7,961 Democrats and 5,965 Republicans hadrequested absentee ballots as of the weekend; 4,800 had beenreturned by Monday, but no breakdown was available.   ``This is a unique situation where the parties really encouragedpeople to vote absentee ballot and I'm not sure what that will do tothe returns,'' Leahy said.</TEXT></DOC>
