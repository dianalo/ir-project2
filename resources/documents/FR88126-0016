It will not result in an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or pricesfor consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local governmentagencies, or geographic regions, or significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofUnited States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Vance L. Clark, Administrator, Farmers Home Administration, has determinedthat this action will not have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities because the revisions provide clarification of existingregulations and the annual volume of the program is expected to continueto decline. FmHA anticipates funding approximately 850 applications nationwide.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact Statement</ITAG>This document has been reviewed according to 7 CFR Part 1940, Subpart G,``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that the actiondoes not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting thequality of the human environment and according to the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-190, an Environmental Impact Statement isnot required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Review</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.415 and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.(7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, 48 FR 29112, June 24, 1983).<ITAG tagnum="84">General Information</ITAG>Numerous editorial and clarifying changes were made to the regulation.For example, references to Section 8 Plan I and Plan II loans were deletedsince there has been no Section 8 available for several years. The likelihoodof Section 8 being available in the future is remote. Some exhibits wereremoved because they are no longer applicable to the program and some weretransferred to more appropriate regulations. In addition, some paragraphswere deleted because they already are addressed in other regulations; inthose cases a citation to the proper regulation has been made. Some paragraphswere deleted because they appeared elsewhere in the regulation and someparagraphs were moved to a more appropriate sequence in this regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>A proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 7584) on March 12, 1987, and invited commentsfor 60 days ending May 11, 1987.Comments were received from 58 different developers, legal services organizations,trade associations, nonprofit organizations, architects, FmHA employeesand other individuals.The following summarizes the comments and the actions taken.A. Initial Operating Capital and Borrower Contribution These comments refer to andSection; 1944.211.Several respondents were concerned that FmHA was requiring the initialoperating capital and the borrower contribution to be in the form of cash,readily convertible securities or land. The respondent felt that the languageshould allow the applicant to be able ``to obtain'' the needed funds. Theycommented that prudent developers do not keep cash sitting around and thatevidence of the ability to be able to obtain the cash could be evidencedby irrevocable letters of credit, scrutiny of financial statements, firmreceivables, etc. One respondent felt that the applicant should have cashfor the initial operating capital and the borrower contribution. <T3>Response: </T3>We agree with the majority of the respondents and changedthe wording to allow the borrower to be able ``to obtain'' the initialoperating capital and borrower contribution, although we are concernedthat the project not be encumbered in any way.Two respondents do not agree that FmHA should be able to lend initial operatingcapital to nonprofit groups and public agencies. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency is concerned that nonprofit groups and publicagencies might not have operating capital available to them and will continueto consider initial operating capital as an eligible loan purpose.Several respondents felt that the requirement that limited partnershipsmust show the borrower contribution and initial operating capital as unencumberedand freely owned should be eliminated. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency has agreed with the suggestion and removedthis requirement.One respondent felt that this section should be clarified to state thatthe initial operating capital cannot be from anticipated future syndicationproceeds. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency has determined that if documentation is providedthat confirms syndication proceeds are due and payable under existing contracts,they can be used to provide the initial operating capital and borrowerequity.B. Ownership InterestThese comments refer to andSection; 1944.211.Several respondents were concerned about the requirement that general partnerswould be required to maintain 5 percent financial interest in both thepartnership and the current losses, profits and cash distribution. Theysuggested that this be changed.<T3>Response: </T3>The Agency has agreed with the suggestion and revisedthe wording to require only a 5 percent ownership interest in the partnershipentity.C. Certified Audited Financial Statements and Number of Preapplications,Applications and LoansThese comments refer to andSection; 1944.211.Many respondents were concerned about andSection; 1944.211 that requiredapplicants to submit certified audited financial statements and limitedthe number of preapplications, applications and loans that any one applicantcould have. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency considered the comments and decided thatrequiring the certified audited financial statements and limiting the numberof preapplications, applications and loans was not the best way to providecontrols on the program. These controls have been replaced by enteringin Exhibit A-6 the requirement that when multiple applications are involved,or when the State Director feels it necessary, the applicant will be askedto submit additional financial information such as a six to twelve monthpro no statement.D. Conversion of 502 Housing to RentalThese comments refer to andSection; 1944.212.Several respondents felt that participation in this effort should not belimited to public agencies and nonprofit organizations. One respondenteach was concerned that the units must be rehabilitated prior to conversionand that the term ``community'' should be defined. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency is required by statute to limit participationto public agencies and nonprofit organizations. Applicants will not beexpected to rehabilitate the 502 units prior to conversion; they will berehabilitated while still in FmHA inventory. The definition of communityhas been included.E. Limitations on Cost IncreasesThese comments refer to andSection; 1944.213.Two respondents felt that we should define ``loan approval'', one feltthat requiring nonprofits to cover cost overruns is not realistic, onefelt that ``unforeseen factors'' should be defined, one felt that the sectionshould be clarified regarding preexisting conditions and one felt thatwe should allow additional funds when overruns were anticipated. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency reviewed all comments and is not changingthis section. It is felt that the section is clearly understandable andthat no one issue was raised enough to merit change. In addition, loanapproval is discussed in another section and additional funds can be approvedfor many unanticipated reasons.F. Size of UnitsThese comments refer to andSection; 1944.215.Many respondents were concerned that square foot guidelines have been reducedand made mandatory. They are concerned about livability, marketabilityand local handicapped regulations requiring larger size and feel that costshould be the overriding factor. Two respondents supported the size reduction.<T3>Response: </T3>After considering all comments, we have decided to increasethe size guidelines for 0-bedroom units. All other units will remain asshown in the prior rule. The requirement that the units ``will'' be withinthe guidelines remains.G. Cost Containment FeaturesThese comments refer to andSection; 1944.215.Many comments were received on various aspects of the cost containmentfeatures in the proposed rule. Due to the importance of cost containment,a new paragraph (a) was added to guide applicants and FmHA employees. Asshown below in the responses to comments, many specific cost containmentitems are now covered in the new cost containment standards paragraph,and the importance of the subject is not to be diminished. Shown beloware the specific areas that were commented on.<T3>Limitation on Use of Loan Funds for Nonessential Facilities: </T3>Manyrespondents were concerned about not being able to use loan funds to financecarports, covered parking, garages and basements. They believe that insome areas these things are essential and that if needed because of weatherconditions, storage requirements or zoning requirements, they should beallowed. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency has considered these comments and has agreedto allow the financing of covered parking or garages only when they arerequired by local zoning.<T3>Sliding Glass Doors: </T3>Many respondents were concerned that slidingglass doors were restricted to south walls and they felt that local conditionsshould govern if and where doors should be placed. Many respondents wereconcerned that insurance rates would increase since sliding glass doorsoften serve as a second means of egress. One respondent did not want slidingglass doors to be permitted in any case. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency has removed this specific provision and,as discussed above, dealt with cost containment through the new cost containmentstandards paragraph.<T3>Marshall Swift ``fair quality''</T3>: Four comments were received concerningthe requirement that comments such as kitchen cabinets and bathroom fixturesnot exceed Marshall Swift ``fair quality'' and three comments were receivedconcerning the requirement that building designs and/or materials not exceed``fair quality''. <T3>Response: </T3>After considering all the comments, we have decidedto remove the references to Marshall Swift entirely. The issue of qualityis an important aspect of cost containment and is addressed in the newcost containment standards paragraph.<T3>Privacy fences, patios and porches: </T3>Two respondents were concernedabout the restriction on privacy fences, patios and porches. They feltthat these items add to the livability of the unit while not costing much.<T3>Response: </T3>The Agency has removed this specific provision and,as discussed above, dealt with cost containment through the new cost containmentstandards paragraph.<T3>Density: </T3>One comment was received supporting the density recommendationsand one comment was received suggesting that we have two ranges, one forfamily and one for elderly. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency feels that the minimum of 14 units per acrein the proposed rule provides enough latitude and has not changed thissection.H. Donated SitesThese comments refer to andSection; 1944.215.Several respondents were concerned that large developers would ``donate''sites (raising other costs to compensate) to receive more priority points.They felt this would be unfair to the smaller, less well-financed developer.Two respondents felt that the term ``others'' needed to be defined. <T3>Response:</T3> The Agency has changed the wording to state that preferencewill be given for land donated by States, units of local government, publicbodies and nonprofit organizations.I. More Than One Site Within a CommunityThese comments refer to andSection; 1944.215.One respondent questioned why separate promissory notes are needed whenonly one mortgage is being taken. One respondent was concerned that wewould allow scattered sites only when an adequate site was not available.Two respondents felt scattered sites should be allowed not only withinthe same community, but also within a larger area. <T3>Response:</T3> The Agency has considered the comments and revised thesection to allow for scattered sites in different communities when a smallcommunity cannot cost effectively support a project or when 502 inventoryunits are involved. The reference to one adequate site and the requirementthat separate promissory notes should be taken has been removed.J. Processing Preapplications and Priority Processing SystemThese comments refer to andSection; 1944.231.Comments were received on many different aspects of this section. We willaddress the different aspects separately.<T3>General Processing:</T3> Several respondents felt that a time limitshould be established for the district and state office. <T3>Response:</T3> Processing times are addressed in Subpart A of Part1910-A; therefore, they will not be included in Subpart A of Part 1944-E.Priority Processing System Criteria:Substandard Housing: One respondent wants information supplied to the stateson a more regular basis. <T3>Response:</T3> The Agency distributes information as available and,in addition, has given States the leeway to use better and more specificlocal data.<T3>Household Income:</T3> One respondent wants information supplied tothe states more regularly. Two respondents felt that alternative data shouldbe allowed for subcounty jurisdictions provided the data is available ona state-wide basis. This would allow for service to lower income areaswithin a higher income county. Two respondents felt that the income criteriais in direct conflict with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and one respondentfelt that the income criteria should be disposed of entirely. Those areasgetting priority points are the areas that are not feasible when usingtax credits. <T3>Response:</T3> The Agency has changed the language to allow the useof better and more specific state-wide data when available. The use ofreliable data on sub-county jurisdictions is also permitted. The Agencyhas the responsibility to finance rural housing that will benefit the lowestincome tenants possible; therefore, we are not eliminating the income elementfrom the priority processing system.<T3>Distance from Ineligible Areas:</T3> Several respondents were concernedthat in highly populated states few projects with viable markets are farfrom urban areas. They proposed that the mileage criteria be eliminated.One respondent felt that sites close to suburban areas will have utilitiesand services which reduce project costs and will have more employment centers.They felt that this criteria is reinforcing the existing trend of givinggreater priority to poorer markets, 8 to 10 unit towns. <T3>Response:</T3> The Agency has reviewed the comments and decided tokeep the criteria, but to eliminate the new mileage distances and go backto the distances that are currently being used. Concerning the commentregarding suburban areas, the agency has the responsibility to financeprojects to reach the rural, lowest income tenants possible and we willcontinue to strive to reach that goal.<T3>No Existing Subsidized Housing:</T3> One respondent felt that subsidizedhousing should not be a criteria, and that the market study should determinethe need. One respondent suggested that it be made clear that elderly andcongregate housing are different types. <T3>Response:</T3> The Agency has made the administrative decision thatit wants to reach the most communities possible and will continue to usethis criteria. The language has been changed to make it clear that elderlyand congregate are considered different types of housing.<T3>Deep Rental Subsidy:</T3> One respondent recommended adding languageto ensure recognition from sources other than FmHA. <T3>Response:</T3> The language has been changed to give priority for deepsubsidy from sources other than FmHA.<T3>Elderly Projects:</T3> Several respondents felt that 10 points placetoo much emphasis on elderly and that 10 points can make the differenceof whether a project gets funded or not. One respondent felt that the prioritydiscriminates against low-income families. One respondent felt that thecurrent 5 point preference generally makes the proposal competitive enoughto be reached for funding. <T3>Response:</T3> The Agency has reviewed this issue and administrativelydecided to leave the priority points at 10.<T3>Donated Land:</T3> Several respondents felt that 10 points place toomuch emphasis on donated land and that large developers who could affordto donate land would have a preference.             <T3>Response: </T3>After considering the comments, the Agency has decidedto reduce the priority points for donated land to 5 points. In addition,an earlier section was revised to define who can donate land, limitingdonors to States, units of local government, public bodies and nonprofitorganizations.<T3>Public Bodies and nonprofit Corporations: </T3>One respondent feltthat giving preference to public bodies and nonprofit corporations is unfairand unfounded. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency has administratively decided that if prioritiesare essentially equal, preference will be given to preapplications frompublic bodies and nonprofit corporations.<T3>Priority Point Implementation Date: </T3>Several respondents were wonderingif ``grandfathering'' would take place for existing preapplications. <T3>Response: </T3>Normally, the implementation date of a new regulationwill apply to all preapplications received after that date. Although ithas not yet been determined, a cut-off date will probably be establishedfor old preapplications to be switched over to the new priority point systemif not yet funded.K. Rental Assistance From Sources Other Than FmHAThese comments refer to andSection; 1944.232.Several respondents were concerned, for various reasons, about the formulaincluded in the proposed rule. Two respondents were concerned about thespecial conditions for small communities. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency has considered all the comments and has rewrittenthis section removing the formula and the restrictions for small communities.Several respondents were concerned about the requirement that there mustbe a market for the project, after the rental subsidy is no longer available,for the life of the loan. <T3>Response: </T3>This is required by statute.L. Related CostsThese comments refer to andSection; 1944.212.Three respondents felt that language should be added to permit loan fundsto be used to pay loan packaging fees for nonprofit applicants. Two respondentsfelt that costs of market studies should be allowed as an eligible loanpurpose and one respondent felt that costs of syndication should be allowed.<T3>Response: </T3>The costs for nonprofit packaging and market studieshave been accepted as eligible loan purposes. The cost of syndication hasnot been adopted as an eligible loan purpose.M. Market Surveys<T3>Exhibit A-6, II B_</T3>One respondent felt that the regulation shouldstate what qualifications a market analyst should have before a study isacceptable. <T3>Response: </T3>The regulation does state that the analyst should havehousing or demographic experience.<T3>Exhibit A-6, II B, D (i)_</T3>Several respondents have stated thatpublic and private nonprofit organizations have the ability and experienceto prepare their own market studies and market surveys. They were alsoconcerned that the professional surveys are costly and an inhibiting factor.<T3>Response: </T3>FmHA has changed its regulation to allow the cost ofmarket studies to be included as an eligible loan purpose. Therefore, theprice of professionally prepared market studies will not have to be borneby nonprofit organizations but will be spread out over the life of theloan. Those organizations also will be permitted to perform their own marketsurveys.<T3>Exhibit A-6, II D_</T3>One respondent suggested that adding the statementof methodology within the market study would convolute the study and wants,instead, to have the analyst present this type of information in personto the local FmHA offices. <T3>Response: </T3>Persons other than those in local FmHA offices alsoreview market studies. It is not possible to personally interview the analystsand including the statement of methodology is the only practical way offollowing the mathematical calculations.<T3>Exhibit A-6, II D (i)_</T3>Several respondents objected to having toemploy someone outside the applicant organization to conduct surveys todetermine the need for new rental units. <T3>Response: </T3>This requirement has been removed and now allows developersto prepare market surveys. If the need is questionable, FmHA may requestthat a full market study be prepared.<T3>Exhibit A-6, II D (ii)_</T3>One respondent recommended that the word``will'' be changed to ``may'' when addressing the need to establish feasibilityfor projects of less than 20 units through the use of market surveys. <T3>Response: </T3>The word ``will'' has been changed to ``may.''<T3>Exhibit A-6, II D (iii)_</T3>One respondent questioned the need fora statement of truthfulness and accuracy since the market study is beingprepared by a professional and that person should certify as to its accuracy.<T3>Response: </T3>This section refers only to market surveys, not professionalmarket studies. Since applicants are responsible for surveys we feel theymust also provide a certification.<T3>Exhibit A-6, II G_</T3>One respondent felt that the requirement thatall market analysts must be members of an association of professional marketanalysts failed to recognize other organizations and groups which are capableof analyzing housing markets. <T3>Response: </T3>This requirement has been deleted from the regulation.<T3>Exhibit A-7_</T3>One respondent felt that the market study guidelinesshould require the analyst to include details of the community peculiarto the elderly population. <T3>Response: </T3>Language has been added to the guidelines to requirethe analyst to include information about the elderly population.<T3>Exhibit A-7_</T3>One respondent suggested that FmHA maintain a listof persons who have been approved to prepare market studies. <T3>Response: </T3>Each state should maintain a list of those marketingfirms which have provided acceptable studies in support of loan requests.The market study guidelines now inform the analyst that he or she willhave to be approved in order to participate in the program. No provisionhas been made at this time to maintain a master list of analysts in theNational Office of FmHA.<T3>Exhibit A-7_</T3>One respondent suggested that the market analystsbe required to submit references, evidence of experience, and samples toFmHA prior to completing a study. <T3>Response: </T3>The market study guidelines now inform the analyst thata completed sample study or a statement of qualifications will be requiredby FmHA before that analyst, or company, will be acceptable.<T3>Exhibit A-7</T3>_One respondent recommended that all requests for marketstudies come from FmHA and not the applicant. The respondent also recommendsthat, after review of the study and the determination that the preapplicationcan be authorized, FmHA would then order a market study from an approvedmarket analyst with the concurrence of the applicant. If the preapplicationcould not be authorized, FmHA would, with the concurrence of the applicant,withdraw its request for the study. The respondent further recommends thatFmHA maintain an acceptable schedule or range of fees for studies. FmHAwould do the contracting for the analyst with the fee being paid by theapplicant. <T3>Response: </T3>While FmHA is at the present time moving toward contractingfor some market studies, complete plans have not been worked out for implementingthis course of action. The foregoing comments will be taken into consideration.<T3>Exhibit A-7</T3>_One respondent recommended that a professionally preparedmarket study be required for all projects of 20 and more units. <T3>Response: </T3>Although the <T4>Federal Register </T4> refers to market ``surveys'' for projects of20 units or more, it was intended that a market ``study'' be required for20 or more units.<T3>Exhibit A-7</T3>_One respondent felt that a market study should notbe acceptable to FmHA if it is prepared by someone who has an identityof interest with the applicant.<T3> Response: </T3>FmHA carefully considered this point and rejected itbecause disallowing those studies could cast an appearance of distrustand suspicion on legitimate and honest market analysts. It is FmHA's opinionthat disallowing the identity of interest analysts would not ensure anaccurate and truthful study from other analysts. We see no reason to disallowan identity of interest in this area when we allow identity of interestrelationships such as architects and contractors.<T3>Exhibit A-7</T3>_One respondent pointed out the need for data on existinghousing units. <T3>Response: </T3>The survey of existing rental housing form was inadvertentlyomitted from this publication. This omission has been corrected.<T3>Exhibit A-7</T3>_One respondent does not feel trending incomes canbe correctly accomplished by a market analyst. <T3>Response: </T3>The use of income data within a market area is to establishwhether there are sufficient incomes to justify feasibility and to measurethe economic fluctuations of the community. Changes in median income canact as a barometer in portraying the economic flexibility of a market area.A market analyst should be able to evaluate this type of data and incorporatethe findings into the market study.<T3>Exhibit A-7</T3>_One respondent felt that there was no need to includeinformation on 1970 employment, labor, and age characteristics in a study.<T3>Response: </T3>We agree that some 1970 data are not necessary and havechanged the guidelines to reflect this.<T3>Exhibit A-7, I</T3>_One respondent stated that to exclude ``establishedcommunities'' as required by the market study guidelines would lead toan unrealistic market area. <T3>Response: </T3>This word ``other'' (other established communities)was omitted in error in the printing of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice.<T3>Exhibit A-7, III B (3)</T3>_One respondent felt that a market studyshould include a discussion of vacant rental units within the market areaand those within nearby communities. <T3>Response: </T3>The market study guidelines in the regulation now includeadditional language concerning the evaluation of existing vacancies withinthe market area. While vacancies in the entire market must be included,vacancies in other established communities outside the market area willnot be considered.<T3>Exhibit A-7, III B 5 (b)</T3>_One respondent questioned the reasonan applicant would request HUD income data from a local FmHA office insteadof from a local HUD office. <T3>Response: </T3>This income information was furnished to local FmHAoffices to assist the preparers of market studies with obtaining the neededdata. Income information may also be obtained from Sales and MarketingManagement Magazine.<T3>Exhibit A-8, (5)</T3>_One respondent objected to FmHA's requirementthat a new market study be obtained after the study<ITAG tagnum="54">is more than 12 months old. </ITAG><T3>Response:</T3> Even though census data will not change within thattime, changes in local housing and employment conditions certainly may.For that reason, FmHA requires updated information to supplement the materialcontained in a market study.One respondent asked if a market study is an eligible loan purpose. <T3>Response:</T3> The new regulation will allow the cost of a market studyto be included as an eligible loan purpose.N. Exhibit A-6<T3>Test for Other Credit</T3>_One respondent felt that FmHA should deletethe requirement that applicants must explain why other lenders are notwilling to extend credit. <T3>Response:</T3> We agree and have removed this requirement.<T3>Environmental Impact</T3>_One respondent pointed out that we requesteda duplication of environmental information. <T3>Response:</T3> We agree and have removed this duplication.<T3>Measuring Square Footage</T3>_One respondent felt that we should notmeasure square footage from the outside walls. <T3>Response:</T3> We agree and have removed this requirement.<T3>Cost Overruns</T3>_One respondent felt that applicants should not haveto sign a statement agreeing to pay all cost overruns. <T3>Response:</T3> We have considered this and do not agree. In addition,the law requires that this statement be signed. <T3>Competitive Bidding</T3>_One respondent felt that competitive biddingrequirements are too strict and that Subpart A of Part 1924 requirementsfor exception to competitive bidding are very difficult. <T3>Response:</T3> We considered this comment and feel that the exceptionauthority in Subpart A of Part 1924 is appropriate. We are not changingthis section.O. Other Comments<T3>Section 1944.205</T3>_One respondent suggested that our definitionof handicapped and disabled persons should be changed to better reflectreality and to remove the discrimination. <T3>Response:</T3> This definition is used in other regulations and cannotbe changed only in the 515 rural rental housing regulation. We feel therespondent has made some valid points and we will consider the change ina future revision.<T3>Section 1944.211</T3>_One respondent recommended that the eligibilitycriteria requiring that the applicant have the ability to maintain andoperate the project for the purposes for which the loan was made be strengthened.<T3>Response:</T3> The Agency has decided that the criteria achieves theintended purpose as is and will not be changed.<T3>Section 1944.211</T3>_One respondent felt that restricting long-termleasing of privately owned land to areas where it is a well establishedpractice is too restrictive and that removing the requirement could makethe program more flexible. <T3>Response:</T3> The Agency agrees with the suggestion and has changedthe wording.<T3>Section 1944.211</T3>_One respondent felt that we should not allowthe return of the initial 2 percent operating capital because borrowersdefer expenses and shield the 2 percent. One respondent felt that the borrowershould be able to have the 2 percent returned even after 5 years. <T3>Response:</T3> The Agency has considered both comments and determinedthat no change will be made.<T3>Section 1944.211</T3>_Two respondents felt that the section statingthat borrowers or principals of borrower organizations who sell or transferloans less than five years old will not be considered for participationin the program for at least five years is only punitive in nature and shouldbe eliminated. <T3>Response:</T3> The Agency has determined that no change will be made.<T3>Section 1944.212</T3>_One respondent felt the requirement that rehabilitatedhousing be substantially equivalent to new construction in quality, livability,design and all other respects can be interpreted too literally. <T3>Response:</T3> The Agency agrees and has changed the wording.<T3>Section 1944.212</T3>_One respondent felt that the language requiringthat rehabilitation costs be equal to or less than new construction istoo rigid. They felt that exceptions should be made when the project ison farmland at the edge of town and when other subsidies are used. Theyalso felt that the term ``area'' should be clarified. <T3>Response:</T3> The Agency has removed this requirement; however, theAgency feels that the definition of community is adequate and is not furtherclarifying ``area''.<T3>Section 1944.212</T3>_Two respondents recommended that we allow loanfunds to be used to purchase land from an applicant. One respondent feltthat the wording should be clarified. <T3>Response:</T3> After reviewing the comments the Agency has decidednot to change this section.<T3>Section 1944.212</T3>_One respondent felt that related facilities suchas tot lots create major liability problems for borrowers and that theyshould have the discretion to choose whether to provide the facilities.The respondent also was concerned that this section made no reference tolaundry rooms. One respondent was concerned that we required related facilitiessuch as stoves and refrigerators in central cooking facilities to be attachedto the real estate. <T3>Response:</T3> The Agency has not changed its requirement to providetot lots in family projects. We feel this is an important part of a familyproject. Laundry rooms are addressed in another part of the text. In congregateprojects where there are central cooking facilities, we feel that the stoves,refrigerators, etc. should be attached to prevent easy removal.<T3>Section 1944.212_</T3>One respondent felt that language should be clarifiedto allow interest on multiple advances to be part of the loan. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency has determined that a change will not bemade. We feel the language is clear in stating that interest will be capitalizedwhen construction is substantially complete and the project is ready foroccupancy. <T3>Section 1944.212_</T3>One respondent felt that it should be made clearthat loan funds can be used for interest and customary charges necessaryto obtain interim financing. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency agrees and has changed the wording. <T3>Section 1944.213_</T3>One respondent pointed out that one section inloan limitations required rental leases to be for not less than 30 daysand that this conflicts with proposed rule FmHA Instruction 1930-C. <T3>Response: </T3>This section has been revised to be consistent withFmHA Instruction 1930-C. <T3>Section 1944.213_</T3>One respondent felt that FmHA should broadenthe instances under which we will finance partially completed projects.<T3>Response: </T3>The Agency has considered the comments and finds meritin them. They will be considered in a subsequent FmHA regulation revision.<T3>Section 1944.215_</T3>Two respondents felt that we should require mastermetering instead of individual because tenants would not have to pay depositsfor the services, rates are generally less and construction cost wouldbe reduced because an outside water loop would not be needed. <T3>Response: </T3>After reviewing these comments the Agency has decidedto continue with individual metering. <T3>Section 1944.215_</T3>One respondent was concerned about requiringa market survey completed by a local or State government agency or by independentorganizations serving handicapped people in order to modify the percentageof handicapped units. <T3>Response: </T3>The market survey requirement has been removed. <T3>Section 1944.215_</T3>Two comments were received suggesting that weallow appraisals to be done by FmHA employees authorized to make appraisalsand by contract appraisers. <T3>Response: </T3>Language has been added allowing for contract appraisers.<T3>Section 1944.221_</T3>One respondent suggested that when bonds areused in lieu of promissory notes submission to the National Office andOGC is not necessary. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency's experience dictates that this requirementis needed, especially in some states. We will be keeping this requirement.<T3>Section 1944.221_</T3>Two respondents suggested that the requirementfor personal liability be removed for all types of entities. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency has considered this recommendation and decidednot to change our requirements. <T3>Section 1944.231_</T3>One comment was received suggesting that FmHaset timetables for itself, as well as for the applicant, after issuanceof an AD-622. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency has not changed this section. <T3>Section 1944.235_</T3>One respondent felt that obligations should beallowed to be transferred when there is a change from profit to nonprofitapplicant. <T3>Response: </T3>Our legal advisors have said that we cannot transferobligations when entity types change. <T3>Section 1944.240_</T3>One respondent felt that applicants and/or advocatesshould be able to request exception authority directly from FmHA's Administrator.<T3>Response: </T3>The Agency does not agree with this suggestion and hasnot changed the wording to allow applicants and/or advocates to requestexception authority from the Administrator. <T3>Section 1944.215_</T3>One respondent felt that the refinancing requirementis unnecessary when considering percent and proposed prepayment regulations.<T3>Response: </T3>The Agency has not changed this section. One respondent asked us to define ``builder's fee''. <T3>Response: </T3>This reference has been removed and readers are referredto Subpart A of Part 1924. <T3>Section 1944.215_</T3>One respondent felt the requirement that thehousing be designed to meet the needs of the types of occupants who willlikely occupy it is in conflict with Subpart C of Part 1930 which allowselderly to occupy family units. <T3>Response: </T3>This has not been changed. The units should still bedesigned for the type of occupant most likely to live in it. One respondent was concerned that the proposed rule did not contain anexhibit for rural cooperative housing. <T3>Response: </T3>Regulations governing rural cooperative housing arebeing worked on under a separate revision and will be published at a laterdate. <T3>Section 1944.212_</T3>One respondent felt that Section 514, as wellas Section 502, housing should be allowed to be converted to rental housing.<T3>Response: </T3>The statute specifically refers to Section 502 beingconverted to Section 515 so no change will be made. <T3>Exhibit A, paragraph IV, B, 4</T3>_One respondent felt that the marketingof units should be in accordance with the AFHMP and public advertising.Other methods should not be permitted. <T3>Response: </T3>We agree and have changed the paragraph. Finally, the Agency received several comments of an editorial nature. Wehave evaluated these comments and have made changes in the Final Rule asappropriate. Typographical errors noted in the Proposed Rule have been corrected. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>7 CFR Part 1924 Agriculture, Construction and repair 7 CFR Part 1930 Accounting, Administrative practice and procedure, Grant Programs_Housingand community development, Loan programs_Housing and community development,Low and moderate housing_Rental, reporting requirements 7 CFR Part 1933 Grant programs_Housing and community development 7 CFR Part 1944 Administrative practice and procedure, Aged, handicapped loan programs_Housingand community development, Low and moderate income housing_Rental, Mortgages,Nonprofit organizations, Rent subsidies, and Rural housing. 7 CFR Part 1951 Account servicing. 7 CFR Part 1965 Administrative practice and procedure.Therefore, Chapter XVIII, Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations is amendedas follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1924_CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR </ITAG>1.

It will be deposited into the general operating account in accordancewith the provisions of the loan agreement or loan resolution prior to thestart of construction or loan closing (whichever is first) and will beused for authorized purposes only.(ii) When the applicant is to provide other movable equipment and furnishings,the initial capital will be increased sufficiently to cover the cost ofthese items.(iii) If the borrower provided the initial 2-percent operating capitalfrom its own funds, after 2 years, but before 5 full budget years of projectoperation, the State Director may authorize the borrower to make a one-timewithdrawal from project funds in accordance with Subpart C of Part 1930of this chapter.(7) Possess the ability, experience, and the legal and financial capacityto incur and carry out the obligations required for the loan.(8) Agree to comply with all FmHA requirements, such as those set forthin the loan resolution, loan agreement, the form of note, the mortgageand FmHA regulations.(9) Provide necessary management to assure the successful operation ofthe project. Management services may be provided by the applicant, a managementfirm or an agent. Management will be handled in accordance with ExibitB to Subpart C of Part 1930 of this chapter.(10) In the case of a private nonprofit organization:(i) If operating in one community and its trade area, meet the followingadditional requirements:(A) The organization must maintain a broadly-based membership reflectinga variety of interests in the community. The organization should have atleast 25 members. The number of members may be decreased for projects withless than 25 units.(B) Each member must be limited to one vote in the affairs of the organization.(C) A majority of the members must reside in the community or the tradearea where the housing will be located.(D) At least five of the members must be recognized as leaders in civic,governmental, fraternal, religious, and other community organizations ofthe community where the housing will be located.(E) There must be at least five people on the board of directors and theymust be selected by a procedure that insures that the interests of minoritiesand women are adequately represented.(F) The directors must be members of the organization.(G) The organization should adopt articles of incorporation and bylawssubstantially conforming to the model articles and bylaws set forth inExhibits C and D, modified as appropriate in accordance with State law.The State Director, with the assistance of OGC, may develop a model setof articles of incorporation and bylaws for the State which are consistentwith Exhibits C and D and publish an appropriate State supplement.(ii) If operating in more than one community or on a county or regionalbasis and providing or planning to provide rental housing in more thanone community, meet the following requirements in addition to those inparagraph (a)(9)(i) except for (a)(9)(i)(C) of this section:(A) The membership base should be representative of the area being servedwith at least five members representing a variety of interests from eachcommunity where the housing will be located.(B) The organization's articles of incorporation and bylaws must includethe requirements outlined in paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(A) of this section.(11) In the case of a limited partnership:(i) The general partners must be able to meet the financial requirementsof andSection; 1944.211(a)(4) of this subpart if the partnership is not ableto when the preapplication is filed.(ii) The general partners must maintain a minimum 5 percent financial interestin the partnership. For this purpose, the minimum 5 percent requirementwill be deemed to have been met if the general partner has a minimum 5percent interest in the residuals or refinancing proceeds. The generalpartner will not be required to have a minimum 5 percent interest in currentprofits, losses, and cash distributions of the partnership. For example,an agreement where the general partners have such a 5 percent interestin a limited partnership and receive only 1 percent of the profits whilethe limited partners receive 99 percent of the profits would be allowable.(iii) The partnership must agree that new general partners can be broughtinto the organization only with the prior written consent of FmHA.(12) Be willing to honor the long-term commitment associated with receiptof a Section 515 loan. Borrowers or principals of borrower organizationswho sell or transfer loans less than 5 years old will not be consideredeligible for further participation in the program as borrowers or principals(i.e., a general partner in a limited partnership) for at least 5 yearsfrom the date of the loan or assumption closing. The State Director maymake an exception to this provision only if the transfer or sale meetsthe hardship provisions of andSection; 1965.65(a)(4) of Subpart B of Part1965 and the applicant meets all other eligibility requirements.(b) <T3>Authorized representative of an applicant</T3>. FmHA will deal onlywith the applicant or its authorized representative and the representative'stechnical advisers. An authorized representative of a nonprofit applicantmust have no pecuniary interest in the award of the architectural or constructioncontracts, the purchase of equipment or the purchase of the land for thehousing site.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1944.212 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Loan purposes.</ITAG>RRH Loans may be made to qualified applicants to:(a) Construct new housing.(b) Purchase and rehabilitate existing buildings only when moderate orsubstantial modifications, repairs or improvements to the structures arenecessary to meet the requirements of decent, safe, and sanitary livingunits.(1) All rehabilitation work to be performed must be classified as eithermoderate or substantial rehabilitation as defined in Exhibit K of SubpartA to Part 1924 of this chapter.(2) The structure to be rehabilitated must be physically and structurallysound enough to afford maximum safety (including fire safety) to the residentsof the structure after rehabilitation.(3) Rehabilitation must be planned and accomplished so that the resultinghousing will:(i) Meet the applicable development standards as provided for in andSection;1924.5(d)(1) of Subpart A of Part 1924 of this chapter and any applicablehistoric preservation requirements.(ii) Create a suitable and appealing living environment and be substantiallyequivalent to new construction in quality and livability.(4) The applicant must submit complete plans and specifications for rehabilitationfor FmHA's review and acceptance.(5) The rehabilitated project must generally meet the provisions of andSection;1944.215(b) of this subpart.(6) When the downtown location of a rehabilitation project dictates such,a portion of the structure (such as part of the ground floor and basement)can be designated for commercial use on a lease basis. RRH loan funds,however, cannot be used to finance <T3>any </T3>cost associated with the commercial space. In order to determinethe correct RRH loan amount for the residential portion of such a structure,the following guidelines will apply: (i) The applicant must supply a complete cost breakdown for purchasingand rehabilitating the entire structure into its joint residential/commercialuse. (ii) The costs that can be easily and appropriately identified as beingpart of either the commercial or residential portion of the structure shouldbe separated.(iii) The costs which cannot be easily and appropriately isolated (suchas the cost associated with repair or renovation of a boiler, the valueof the structure ``as is,'' and certain mechanical or electrical componentsthat will benefit both commercial and residential tenants will be proratedbetween the two uses based on the percentage of equipment load (example_centralboiler or air conditioning) which would be necessary for each portion ofthe structure. (iv) For the purposes of the loan limitations in andSection; 1944.213(a)(1) and (2) of this subpart, the term ``development cost'' means the developmentcosts associated with or prorated to the residential use of the structure,and the term ``security value'' is the security value of the project exclusiveof the value contributed to the land and structure(s) by the commercialspace. The capitalization approach to value is one means by which FmHAmay establish the value contributed by the commercial space. (v) The applicant must rely on other sources of financing for all costsassociated with or prorated to the commercial space, given the FmHA securityrequirements of andSection; 1944.221 of this subpart. (7) The applicant may not lease any authorized commercial space withoutthe prior written consent of the State Director. Prior to loan closing,the advice of OGC will be obtained as to any modifications needed in themortgage, loan agreement or loan resolution to enforce this requirement.The State Director may not consent to any lease unless: (i) The lease contains a provision by which the lessee agrees to vacatethe premises if FmHA withdraws its consent to the lease. (ii) The proposed use of the leased space has a mutually supportive relationshipto the needs of the residential tenants and to the use of the residentialportion of the structure. (iii) The terms of the lease and the proposed use of the leased space donot jeopardize the interests of the tenants of the project or the continueduse of the residential portion of the structure. (iv) The lease has been reviewed by OGC and found to be legally sufficientand in compliance with the requirements of this subpart. (c) Purchase and improve the necessary land on which the housing will belocated. (1) Loan funds used to purchase land may not exceed the estimated marketvalue of the site in its present condition as shown by a current appraisalin accordance with Subpart B of Part 1922 of this chapter (available inany FmHA office). Purchase price in excess of estimated market value willnot be used in determining the applicant's initial investment. (2) Loan funds will not be used to buy land from an applicant or a memberof an applicant/organization or from another organization in which anymember of the applicant/organization has an interest except that, withprior approval of the State Director, loan funds may be used to buy landfrom a member of a broadly-based nonprofit applicant/organization. (3) Loan funds may be used to acquire land in excess of that needed forthe housing, including related facilities, only when: (i) The applicant cannot acquire only the needed land at a fair price,can justify the acquisition, agrees to sell the land as soon as practicableand apply proceeds on the loan, and has legal authority to acquire andadminister the land; and (ii) The cost of the excess land is a reasonable portion of the loan.(d) Develop and install streets, a water supply, and sewage disposal, heating,cooling, and light systems necessary in connection with the housing. Ifthe facilities are located offsite, the following requirements must bemet:(1) The applicant will hold the title to the facility or have a legal rightto use the facility for a period of at least 25 percent longer than thelife of the loan and the title or right can be transferred to any subsequentowner of the site. (2) The facilities are provided for the exclusive use of the RRH projector funds are limited to the prorated part of the total cost of the facilityaccording to the use and benefit to the project. The applicant will agreein writing to the application, as extra payments on the RRH loan, of anysubsequent collection by the borrower from other users or beneficiariesof the facility. (3) Adequate security can be obtained with or without a mortgage basedon the offsite facilities. (e) Develop other related facilities in connection with the housing suchas: (1) Maintenance workshop and storage facilities. (2) Recreation center when the project is large enough to justify the facility.In all projects, passive recreation (such as outdoor seating) for elderlyprojects and active facilities (such as tot lots) for family projects willbe provided. (3) Central cooking and dining in congregate and group living housing whenthe project is large enough to justify them to supplement the kitchen facilitiesin each unit. All equipment purchased with loan funds for the central cookingand dining facilities, such as stoves, refrigerators, ovens, dish washingmachines and steam tables, should be attached to the land or buildingsin a manner regarded in law as part of the real estate. The applicant mustprovide a long range plan for the benefit of the tenants which addressesthe long-term availability of assistance from the Area Agency on Aging,the local office of the State Vocational Rehabilitation Agency, or Statedevelopmental disabilities or mental health agency. If assistance is notavailable from local organizations or other State or Federal agencies,the applicant must be able to operate the facilities for the benefit ofthe tenants with its own funds. In the case of a lease, the payment tothe borrower should be sufficient to cover the annual operating expenses,debt services and reserve account attributable to the leased portion ofthe project. The cost of the food and other support services will not bereflected in the FmHA budget that shows the operation and maintenance costof the housing project. This will not preclude tenants who voluntarilyuse the service from paying a separate charge for these services. If neededin the community, FmHA may permit facilities in the project larger thanthose required solely by the tenants provided other sources of funds areavailable to pay a pro rata share of the cost. When the facilities areprovided with loan funds, the following conditions must be met: (i) The meals must be wholesome and economical. A minimum of one cookedmeal per day, at least 5 days per week, must be provided. If tenants arecharged for meals, the charges must be separate from their rental charges.(ii) If the entity that operates the facility is eligible to accept foodstamps under the regulations of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) ofthe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the entity must beauthorized by FNS to accept food stamps from the tenants for the purchaseof meals. (iii) The services to be provided and the fees to be charged (if any) mustbe fully documented by a signed statement from the applicant if it willprovide the services, or in a lease agreement if the services will be providedby others. Any lease agreement must be approved by the State Director orthe loan approving official and contain the following statement:<ITAG tagnum="21">This agreement will not be effective until approved by the State Directorof the Farmers Home Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, orthe State Director's delegated representative.</ITAG>(4) Space for a small infirmary for emergency care only when justifiedby the size of the project. An infirmary will not be justified if facilitiesfor emergency care expected to be needed by the tenants are readily accessibleelsewhere. (f) Construct office and living quarters for the resident manager and otheroperating personnel if the facilities would be to the advantage of theproject and the Government. The State Director should make a determinationand the justification will be included in the docket.(g) Purchase and install ranges, refrigerators, drapes, drapery rods andclothes washers and dryers. Laundry facilities are required in all projectsand clothes washers and dryers should be provided in a central laundryroom. Normally, a minimum of one washer and dryer should be provided forevery 8 to 12 units in a project. Clothes washers and dryers may not beinstalled in individual rental units if the installation is not customaryin the area for the size of project and type of housing involved. In anycase, both central and individual laundry facilities will not be providedin a single project.(h) Provide landscaping, seeding or sodding of lawns, and other necessaryfacilities related to buildings such as walks, yards, fences, parking areas,and driveways.(i) Pay related costs such as fees and charges for market studies, taxcredit fees, and legal, archeological, architectural, engineering, environmentaland other appropriate technical and professional services. The fees andcharges may be paid to an applicant or officer, director, trustee, stockholder,member or agent of the applicant provided those fees and charges are reasonableand typical for the area and are earned. Legal, technical, and professionalfees do not include the costs incurred in the formation or incorporationof the limited profit applicant, costs of syndication, or the payment ofa loan packaging or development fee.(j) Provide loan funds to enable a nonprofit corporation or consumer cooperativeto pay a qualified consulting organization or foundation, operating ona nonprofit basis, to assist it in the formation or incorporation and forthe development and packaging of its loan docket and project and to paylegal, technical and professional fees incurred in the formation or incorporationof the applicant entity. The State Director must determine that:(1) Either_(i) The applicant, with available FmHA assistance, cannot meet all requirementsfor a sound loan without the services; or(ii) The services would permit significant financial savings to the Government,either directly or by reducing the workload involved in processing applications.(2) The charges are reasonable in amount, considering the cost of similarservices and the amount and the purpose of the loan.(k) Pay construction interest as follows:(1) In the case of multiple advances, loan funds will not be used to payconstruction interest. Accrued interest during construction will be capitalizedwhen construction is substantially complete, loan funds are fully advancedand the project is ready for full operation or when advances plus accruedinterest reach the maximum debt limit (MDL). When requested by the borrower,each month the District Director will provide the borrower monthly computationsof the amount of interest that is accruing during the construction period.(2) In the case of interim financed construction, interest accrued andcustomary charges necessary to obtain interim financing may be includedin the loan amount.(l) Purchase housing from an interim lender that holds fee simple titleto an RRH project upon which construction commenced pursuant to andSection;1944.235(c)(1) and after issuance of a letter of commitment to the interimlender in accordance with Exhibit B of this subpart, when all of the followingconditions exist.(1) The interim lender holds title to the property because the originalRRH applicant for whom funds were obligated will not or cannot continuewith the project after a letter such as that shown in Exhibit B to thissubpart was issued.(2) The owner of the property is the interim lender to whom FmHA issueda letter such as that shown in Exhibit B to this subpart for the constructionof the project.(3) The project is substantially complete (see andSection; 1944.235(c)(1)(vi)of this subpart), all work has been satisfactorily completed in a workmanlikemanner in accordance with the originally approved drawings, specificationsand contract documents, and is in compliance with Subparts A and C of Part1924 of this chapter.(4) There are no unpaid obligations outstanding in connection with theproject.(5) All other requirements of this subpart have been met.(m) Pay for related costs incurred in compliance with the Uniform RelocationAssistance and Real Property Acquisition Act of 1970 and in accordancewith andSection; 1944.215(t) of this subpart.(n) Construct demonstration projects involving innovative housing unitsand systems which do not meet existing published standards, rules, regulations,or policies, but do meet the intent of providing decent, safe, and sanitaryrural rental housing. Only the Administrator may authorize loan funds tobe used for this purpose.(o) Finance the conversion of Section 502 units in inventory to a Section515 project in accordance with the requirements of this subpart and SubpartC to Part 1955 of this chapter. Loans for this purpose can be made onlyto public agencies and private nonprofit organizations. Units should berepaired or rehabilitated prior to conversion to Section 515 housing.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1944.213 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Limitations.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Loan limits. </T3>The amount of the RRH loan(s) on each project islimited to the maximum amount of the State Director's loan approving authorityunless the National Office provides prior written authorization. To requestNational Office authorization, the State Director must submit the preapplication,detailed information on the need and market for the project, and his/herrecommendations. This must be done before Form AD-622, ``Notice of PreapplicationReview Action,'' or any other notice is given to the applicant indicatingthat the loan has been determined eligible. Additional loans to the sameapplicant entity may be made on the same or contiguous site without regardto this limitation if the previous project is completed and is being successfullyoperated. A clear market demand must be evidenced for any addtional unitsto be provided. Each loan will also be subject to the following additionalrequirements:(1) For nonprofit corporations, consumer cooperatives, and State or localpublic agencies, the amount of the RRH loan(s) will be limited to the developmentcost or the security value of each project, whichever is less, plus the2 percent initial operating capital and/or the relocation costs incurredas indicated in andSection; 1944.215(t) of this subpart.(2) For all other applicants, the amount of the RRH loan(s) will be limitedto no more than 95 percent of the development cost or 95 percent of thesecurity value of each project, whichever is less.(3) For all applicants, the amount of the loan after capitalized constructioninterest is considered will not exceed the loan limits in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. However, Predetermined Amortization ScheduleSystem (PASS) loans closed with multiple advances may exceed that amountwhen an additional amount is permitted to allow interest to be capitalizedto the first of the following month.(4) All borrowers must agree in writing to provide funds from their ownresources to pay any cost for completing planned construction after theMDL is reached.(b) <T3>Limitations on use of loan funds. </T3>Loans will not be made for:(1) Specialized equipment for training and therapy.(2) Commercial facilities except essential service-type facilities fortenants when such facilities are not conveniently available.(3) Housing to serve primarily temporary and transient residents.(4) Nursing homes, special care facilities, or institutional-type homes.(5) Operating capital for a central dining facility or any items whichdo not become affixed to the real estate security, such as special portableequipment, furnishings, kitchen ware, dining ware, eating utensils, movabletables, and chairs, etc.(6) Nonessential facilities such as fireplaces, saunas, whirlpools, gyms,and swimming pools.(7) Refinancing debts of the applicant except:(i) As authorized in andSection; 1944.235(c) and andSection; 1944.213(c)(1)of this subpart; or(ii) When a nonprofit organization or a State or local public agency applicantalready owns land on which a lien exists and a subordination or releasecannot be obtained and the applicant does not have the financial resourcesnecessary to obtain a release of the existing lien(s). In this situation,loan funds may be used to obtain a release of the land needed for the siteof the proposed project. The amount of funds used for such purposes willbe limited to the amount necessary to obtain the release but will not exceedthis ``as is'' value of the land as determined in accordance with FmHAInstruction 1922-B (available in any FmHA office).(8) Payment of any fee, charge or commission to any broker, negotiatoror other person for the referral of a prospective applicant or solicitationof a loan.(9) Payment of any fee, salary, commission, profit, or compensation toan applicant or to any officer, director, trustee, stockholder, member,or agent of an applicant except as provided in andSection; 1944.212(j) ofthis subpart.(10) Land which the applicant or a member of an applicant/organizationowns or land which is owned by any other organization in which any memberof the applicant/organization has an interest, except as authorized inandSection; 1944.212(c)(2).(11) Compensation to an applicant for value of land contributed in excessof the initial 5 percent contribution.(c) <T3>Obligations incurred before loan closing. </T3>When an applicant filesa preapplication for a loan, the District Director will advise the applicantnot to start construction or incur any indebtedness until the loan is closed,except for those cases involving interim financing; the guidelines outlinedin andSection; 1944.235(c)(1) of this subpart will then apply. During theperiod of preapplication review and processing, applicants will not takeany actions with respect to their applications which would have an adverseimpact on the environment or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives.This requirement does not preclude the applicant from developing preliminaryplans or designs or performing other work necessary to support an applicationfor Federal, State, or local permits or assistance. If the applicant incursdebts for work, materials, land purchase, or other authorized fees andcharges before the loan is closed, the State Director may authorize theuse of loan funds to pay the debts when all of the following conditionsexist:(1) The debts were incurred:(i) After the applicant filed a written preapplication for a loan withFmHA;(ii) Prior to the date of application as part of a predevelopment loanspecifically intended as temporary financing from a public agency or nonprofitorganization and the State Director secures prior concurrence from theNational Office; or(iii) Prior to the date of application as part of a development loan madeto a State or local public agency specifically intended as temporary financingand the State Director secures prior concurrence from the National Office.(2) The applicant is unable to pay the debts from its own resources orto obtain credit from other sources and failure to authorize the use ofloan funds to pay the debts would impair the applicant's financial position.(3) The debts were incurred for eligible loan purposes.(4) Contracts, materials, construction, and any land purchased meet FmHAstandards and requirements.(5) Payment of the debts will remove any liens which have attached andany basis for liens that may attach to the property on account of suchdebts.(d) <T3>Limitations on cost increases. </T3>After loan approval of a projectinvolving new construction or major rehabilitation:(1) No increase in per unit development cost will be approved, whetherthe circumstance causing the cost increase occurs before, during, or afterthe construction period, unless these conditions were unforeseen factorsbeyond the owner's control, such as:(i) Design changes required by FmHA or State or local government havingjurisdiction over the development of the project; or(ii) Changes in financing approved by FmHA.(2) Any cost increase which cannot be approved for funding by FmHA mustbe satisfied by the owner from its own resources.

Cost containment is not to be interpreted as accepting poordesign or cheap construction. Projects must provide the features and amenitiesnecessary for the lifestyles of the tenants.Cost containment challenges us to consider the cost/benefit ratio whenevaluating, recommending or requiring specific design features or constructiontechniques. The following guidelines should be followed when developingRRH projects:(1) Each State architect/engineer should compile and maintain data or spreadsheetson cost/sq. ft., cost/unit, and cost/acre, A/E fees, etc., which are reasonableand customary for the State. Any proposal that exceeds those costs shouldbe carefully evaluated for possible cost reductions. Final determinationsmust be realistic, interrelated to maintenance and operation costs, andbased upon local conditions and common sense.(2) The elimination or reduction of unnecessary delays in application processingcan contribute to cost containment through lower interest and other businessexpenses on land, inventory, tests, design studies, etc. When reasonableprocessing timeframes are established, known and followed, appropriatetime can be planned for preparing quality application and constructiondocuments. This can result in better instructions to the builder, fewererrors and lower construction costs.(3) Most materials and systems are available in a range of qualities andprices. The construction documents should be carefully reviewed for specificationsthat require qualities or grades higher than necessary. These specificationsshould be accepted only if fully justified and no reasonable alternativesare available.(4) Designs which encourage standard building material dimensions and reducewaste will be used as much as possible.(5) State Directors should encourage the use of sites that require a minimumamount of site development. State Directors should also encourage projectswith a minimum of 14 units per acre unless the applicant provides documentationsupporting a change, such as local zoning requirements requiring a differentdensity.(6) Items such as covered parking and garages can be included in the FmHAloan only when they are required by local codes or ordinances.(7) Sound judgment and common sense must also be used in construction inspectionsand final acceptance of projects. Field staff involved in these activitiesmust be careful not to impose additional or unreasonable requirements onthe builder that will increase construction costs.(8) When evaluating RRH projects, life cycle costs will be considered.These costs include: Initial costs, future replacement costs and operationand maintenance costs. The economic lives of alternative design and materialswill be considered. Reductions in initial costs may result in higher lifecycle costs.(9) Management, maintenance and community rooms should not exceed the limitationsdescribed in the FmHA Manual of Acceptable Practices (available in anyFmHA office). Laundry rooms should be no larger than necessary to accommodateequipment, circulation and areas for sorting and folding clothes.(b) <T3>Type of housing.</T3> All housing should be designed to:(1) Be economically constructed and not of elaborate design or materials.All new construction will conform with the applicable development standardsof andSection;1924.5(d)(1) of Subpart A of Part 1924 of this chapter. Asa general rule, the gross square foot living area of new rental units andrelated facilities to be constructed with RRH loan funds will be withinthe ranges listed below.

Minimum room sizes may be determined by the minimum areas inGuide 2 of Subpart A of Part 1924 of this chapter.(iv) Additional area to accommodate energy conserving and solar heatingelements such as vestibules, heat sinks, solar greenhouses, solar heatstorage devices and the like may be allowed in excess of the stated maximumsize guidelines. However, such devices, if included, must be justifiedon a cost effective basis.(2) Consist of multi-unit type housing with two or more units and appropriaterelated facilities except for the conversion of Section 502 inventory housingas covered in andSection;1944.212(o) of this subpart, manufactured homesand group living arrangements. Group-type single household dwellings, iffinanced, must meet the following requirements:(i) In most cases, consist of single household dwellings that can be economicallyconverted to a rental or homeownership unit for a family if the need forthis type housing ceases.(ii) The applicant must show that adequate support services needed by thetenants will be available on a continuous long range basis. As a generalrule, the support services must be provided by a State or local publicagency. However, a nonprofit organization with a successful history andan ongoing program may be considered capable of providing these supportservices.(3) Be residential in character and be designed to meet the needs of eligibletenants. Generally, RRH structures should not be more than three storieshigh. However, low-rise structures with elevators can be considered whenthe following conditions exist:(i) There is a serious shortage of suitable building sites, the numberof units needed cannot be built due to lack of space on available suitablesites and other building sites are not available.(ii) Land costs are such that one- to three-story construction would resultin a unit cost and rental rates in excess of what eligible tenants canafford.(iii) The number of stories proposed for the structure is compatible withother rental structures in the community.If there are no other low-rise rental structures in the community, theproposed structure must be in character with surrounding structures.(iv) The cost of the units should compare favorably with one- to three-storyconstruction financed with RRH loans. If the costs are higher, the loanwill not be approved until the FmHA State architect or engineer has reviewedthe plans, specifications and cost data to assure that further cost savingscannot be achieved without sacrificing the quality and serviceability ofthe housing.(v) Elevators will be provided in accordance with the applicable developmentstandards. If elevators are included, the subsoil conditions of the sitemust be adequate for the installation of elevators and sufficient servicepersonnel must be available in the area for service and repair work.(4) Provide kitchen and bath facilities consistent with the size of theunit. For example, units with three or less bedrooms typically can be designedwith one bath. However, townhouse units with three or more bedrooms whereliving area is on two floors may contain bath facilities on both levels.Kitchen facilities are required in all units; however, in congregate housing,some or all of the units may have limited facilities, such as a cooktopwith a small oven and refrigerator.(5) Give maximum consideration to energy conservation. To keep operatingcosts at a minimum, units should be individually metered for utilitiesunless adequate justification is provided to show that it would be infeasible.(6) Meet the needs of handicapped tenants. At least 5 percent of the unitsin the project or one unit, whichever is greater, must be accessible toor adaptable for physically handicapped persons. The percentage of theunits provided may be modified if an applicant shows, through informationobtained from a State, local or independent agency or organization servinghandicapped people, that a different percentage of accessible or adaptableunits is appropriate. However, at least one accessible unit will be provided.Adaptable units must be constructed in accordance with the uniform FederalAccessibility Standards, Sections 4.34.3 through 4.34.6.(c) <T3>Determination of per unit rental rates for group living arrangements.</T3>To determine the amount of rental payment to be collected per unitfor housing involving a group living arrangement (and only for this particulardetermination), the total annual cost to operate the facility (line 38of Form FmHA 1930-7, ``Statement of Budget and Cash Flow'') will be dividedby the total square footage to be occupied by the tenant. If the projectalso includes conventional rental apartment units (1, 2, 3, etc. bedroomunits), the square footage of those <T3>units</T3> (not bedrooms) will be added to the square footage of theother units (bedrooms) contained in the housing involving group arrangement,and the total square footage of all the units will be divided into line38 of Form FmHA 1930-7. The number arrived at by dividing the total squarefootage into line 38 of Form FmHA 1930-7 then will be multiplied by thesquare foot area of each <T3>unit</T3> to determine the rental rate of the particular <T3>unit</T3>. In the case of housing involving a group living arrangement,each bedroom will be counted as if it were one rental unit. However, thebedroom occupied by the resident assistant will be excluded from this numberand will not be counted in making the determination of rental payment tobe charged to all the other bedrooms occupied by the tenant(s). Once thischarge per unit has been calculated, the rental payment by the tenant(s)will be determined in the usual manner.(d) <T3>Deferred principal payments.</T3>(1) When construction is funded by multiple advances from FmHA, principalpayments on the loan will be deferred for the period of construction.(2) When an interim financed loan is closed other than the first day ofthe month, principal payments will be deferred for the remaining periodof the month in which the loan is closed.(3) When construction is substantially complete and the project is readyfor full operation, or the total of principal advances plus accrued interestreaches the MDL, interest on the advances will be accrued to the AmortizationEffective Date (AED) and will be capitalized, establishing a new principal(loan) amount.(4) At loan obligation, the MDL will be established according to andSection;1944.213(a) of this subpart. When the final advance on the loan is issuedor the MDL is reached, the Finance Officer will:(i) Accrue interest on all advances through the last day of the month andcapitalize the interest as of the AED. When there is a remaining obligationbalance, it will be canceled by the Finance Office.(ii) Establish the new loan amount and the borrower's monthly paymentscomputed over the remaining term of the loan.(5) The District Office will:(i) Contact the applicant and complete Form FmHA 1944-52, ``Multiple FamilyHousing Promissory Note.''(ii) Implement Form FmHA 1944-7, ``Interest Credit and Rental AssistanceAgreement,'' at AED or when the project is substantially complete and readyfor full operation, whichever is later.(e) <T3>Refinancing RRH loans.</T3> Each borrower must agree to refinance theunpaid balance of the RRH loan at the request of FmHA when it appears toFmHA that the borrower is able to obtain a loan from responsible cooperativeor private credit sources at rates and terms which FmHA considers reasonable,and still rent the units to eligible tenants at rental rates within theirpayment ability. The refinancing of a loan must comply with the restrictionsindicated in andSection; 1944.236(b)(5) of this subpart and Subpart F ofPart 1951 of this chapter.(f) <T3>Loan resolution or loan agreement. </T3>The loan resolution or loanagreement contains provisions of policy and procedure which should be carefullyread and fully understood by the applicant. If any provisions are not appropriateto a particular case, proposed substitute language must be approved byFmHA and OGC. Subpart C of Part 1930 provides for the maintenance of certainaccounts and the pledge of housing income as security. It contains regulatoryprovisions governing and giving FmHA power to impose requirements regardingthe housing and related operations of the applicant. All sections and requirementsdetermined applicable by OGC will form part of any other loan resolutionor agreement that may be submitted by the applicant. These are:(1) Form FmHA 1944-33, ``Loan Agreement for an RRH Loan to an IndividualOperating on a Profit Basis or RRH Loan to an Individual Operating on aLimited Profit Basis.''(2) Form FmHA 1944-34, ``Loan Agreement for an RRH Loan to a PartnershipOperating on a Profit Basis or RRH Loan to a Limited Partnership Operatingon a Profit Basis or RRH Loan to a Partnership Operating on a Limited ProfitBasis or RRH Loan to a Limited Partnership Operating on a Limited ProfitBasis.''(3) Form FmHA 1944-35, ``Loan Resolution for an RRH Loan to a Broadly BasedNonprofit Corporation or RRH Loan to a Profit Type Corporation or RRH Loanto a Profit Type Corporation Operating on a Limited Profit Basis.''(g) <T3>Interest credits and rental assistance (RA).</T3>(1) Borrowers may receive interest credits if they meet the requirementsoutlined in Exhibit B of Subpart C to Part 1930 of this chapter.(2) RA may be provided to eligible tenants in eligible projects in accordancewith Exhibit E to Subpart C of Part 1930 of this chapter. (3) At least 95 percent of RA units available for newly constructed projectsmust be used to assist very low-income tenants. Up to 5 percent can beused for low-income tenants. (h) <T3>Nondiscrimination in use and occupancy. </T3>The borrower will notdiscriminate or permit discrimination by any agent, lessee or other operatorin the use or occupancy of the housing or related facilities because ofrace, color, religion, age, sex, marital status, handicap or national origin,in accordance with Subpart E of Part 1901 of this chapter. (i) <T3>Eligibility for occupancy. </T3>Loans will be made on the basis ofthe housing being occupied by eligible tenants as defined in andSection;1944.205 of this subpart. Eligible tenants must meet the requirements ofExhibit B of Subpart C of Part 1930 of this chapter. (1) A group living arrangement may limit occupancy to eligible developmentallydisabled persons. This limitation will be outlined in the applicant/borrower'smanagement plan. The following will apply to group living homes: (i) In many cases, tenants of group homes will be paying more than 30 percentof their adjusted income towards shelter costs. Group homes are unique,serve a special need or purpose and tenants residing in them normally havefewer expenses than typical RRH tenants. Most receive social security and/orother benefits provided by the State. Many also receive small incomes fromjobs or training centers. Therefore, group home tenants can usually afford to pay more than 30 percentof their income towards shelter costs. Tenants should have enough incometo pay for shelter costs, personal needs and other needs not covered bythe State or organization. This policy of acknowledging prospective tenantswho will most likely be paying more than 30 percent of their income towardsshelter costs in determining project feasibility and size is only in referenceto group homes and is not applicable to the regular RRH and congregatehousing programs. (ii) Tenants of group homes may be encouraged but not required to be apart of an ongoing training or rehabilitation program sponsored by theapplicant or other organization. (iii) The prospective tenants may be selected from the local, regionaland/or statewide market area, in that order.  (2) In congregate housing, and housing involving group living arrangements,a further critical dimension is added by the selection and placement oftenants. This involves determining the ability of a tenant with a functionalimpairment to sustain relative independence, given the supportive service(s)provided. While this determination can be made by the project management,it is recommended that it be made by a professionally qualified tenantselection committee and the decision presented to the project managementfor acceptance or rejection. This determination can be made in a highlytechnical fashion using scientifically developed scales of competence inthe activities of daily living, or it can be made by social or medicalsources. The functional impairments of tenants should be verified by oneof the following methods: (i) Certification by a physician, or State or local agency responsiblefor supportive services to the tenant as to the tenant's ability to remainindependent with assistance from service(s). (ii) By the use of any objective guide, such as the guides in Exhibit B-10of Subpart C of Part 1930, and Exhibit B10A of Subpart C of Part 1930,``Type of Living Environment Needed in Relation to Nature and Degree ofDisability.'' These guides can be used by management to assess a person'scapacity for personal care and independent or semi-independent living.(j) <T3>Tenant certification. </T3>Initial certification and recertificationswill be executed on Form FmHA 1944-8, ``Tenant Certification,'' in accordancewith Exhibit B to Subpart C of Part 1930 of this chapter. (k) <T3>Supervision of borrowers. </T3>Supervision will be provided borrowersunder Subpart C of Part 1930 and Subpart B of Part 1965 of this chapter.(l) <T3>Establishing profit base on initial investment. </T3>Applicants agreeingto operate on a limited profit basis will be permitted a return not toexceed 8 percent per annum on their initial investment determined at thetime of loan approval. This amount will be reflected in the loan agreementor loan resolution and will not be changed once it is determined. The initialinvestment may exceed the required 5 percent in andSection; 1944.213(a)(2)of this subpart and may include the following: (1) Cash contributions made by the applicant which, when added to the FmHAloan amount, are not in excess of the security value of the project. (2) The value of the building site or essential related facilities contributedby the applicant up to the amount which, when added to the FmHA loan amount,is not in excess of the security value of the project. An appraisal willbe done by an FmHA employee authorized to make appraisals or an FmHA authorizedrepresentative in accordance with applicable FmHA regulations. Value ofthe applicant's contribution will be determined on an ``as is'' basis lessany amount owed on the property. (m) <T3>Intergovernmental review. </T3>FmHA will consider comments receivedin accordance with 7 CFR Part 3015, ``Intergovernmental Review of Departmentof Agriculture Programs and Activities,'' when making decisions on loanapplications. (See FmHA Instruction 1940-J, available in any FmHA office.)(n) <T3>Guidelines for preparing environmental assessments and environmentalimpact statements. </T3>All projects will comply with Subpart G of Part1940 of this chapter. (o) <T3>National flood insurance. </T3>The provisions of the National FloodInsurance Act of 1968, as amended by the Flood Disaster Protection Actof 1973 and Executive Order 11988, are applicable to FmHA authorities permittingfinancing of rental housing now located in, or to be located in, specialflood or mudslide-prone areas as designated by the Federal Emergency ManagementAdministration (FEMA). Subpart B of Part 1806 of this chapter (FmHA Instruction426.2) and Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter will apply. (p) <T3>Location of housing. </T3>(1) The location of the project should expand the supply of decent, safe,and sanitary housing for very low-, low- and moderate-income elderly personsand families in a nondiscriminatory way. The location should promote agreater choice of housing opportunities in the housing market area. (2) Project locations should promote an equal opportunity for the inclusionof all groups regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin,age, marital status or physical or mental handicap thereby opening up nonsegregatedhousing opportunities for minorities. (3) Except as otherwise permitted by paragraph (p)(6) of this section,housing projects must be located in residential areas as part of establishedrural communities where essential public facilities (such as schools, hospitalsand generally central water and sewer systems) and services (such as shopping,medical, and pharmaceutical) are readily available in close and convenientproximity to the site. Public facilities and services must be adequateto support the needs of the tenants and the housing project. (See FmHAInstruction 1922-B, andSection; 1922.55.)(4) In order to provide housing at the lowest cost possible, preferencewill be given to loan requests in which specific tracts of land will bedonated by States, units of local government, public bodies and nonprofitorganizations. The land must be suitable for the proposed housing and meetall FmHA site criteria. In addition, affording such preference must becost effective.(5) Noncontiguous sites.(i) Noncontiguous sites within the same community may be considered iffeasible. Each site must meet all FmHA site criteria and an appraisal mustbe made on each site in accordance with andSection; 1922.55(a)(7) of SubpartB to Part 1922 of this chapter (available in any FmHA office). The unitsmust be managed under one management plan with one loan agreement/resolution.(ii) If a small community cannot support a project containing enough unitsto make it cost effective or in cases involving conversion of 502 inventoryunits, FmHA will consider a project which includes more than one site inthe same or different communities. The State Office and applicant mustmutually agree that the location of the sites will not adversely effectthe efficiency of management and servicing of the projects. The requirementsof paragraph (p)(5)(i) of this section will also apply.(6) FmHA will consider financing new construction or the purchase and rehabilitationof existing structures (in accordance with andSection; 1944.212(b) of thissubpart) located in the downtown business areas of rural communities thathave established a comprehensive strategy for meeting their community developmentand housing needs. That strategy must include the redevelopment, rehabilitation,restoration or revitalization of the downtown business area. The proposedproject site must be located within the downtown business redevelopment/revitalizationarea and the following conditions must be met:(i) Essential public facilities (such as schools, hospitals and generallycentral water and sewer systems) and services (such as shopping, medicaland pharmaceutical) must be readily available in close and convenient proximityto the site and must be adequate to support the needs of the tenants andthe housing project.(ii) The community must have an official short-term community developmentand housing plan which sets forth its comprehensive strategy for meetingidentified community development and housing needs. The plan will includethe need for eliminating and preventing economic decay, slums or blight;the need of benefiting the lower-income population; or other communitydevelopment needs having a particular urgency. The strategy should includea community-wide component which describes the development strategy ofthe governing body, the major objectives the governing body seeks to accomplish,the priorities it has established, the factors taken into account in selectingareas for treatment and the anticipated public and private sources of fundsnecessary to conduct the treatment of each area selected. In addition,the plan should contain the following component strategies:(A) <T3>Neighborhood revitalization:</T3> The strategy for alleviating physicaldeterioration, maintaining viable neighborhoods and stimulating investmentto upgrade neighborhoods affected by blight and deterioration.(B) <T3>Housing:</T3> The community-wide strategy to improve housing conditionsand to meet the housing assistance needs that have been identified. Referenceto any current HUD approved housing assistance plan would be helpful aspart of this component strategy.(C) <T3>Economic development:</T3> The strategy for attracting private investmentin the business community and for solving the critical problems which maybe the result of a stagnating or declining tax base or from populationoutmigration.(iii) Evidence must be presented from the local governing body verifyingthat the community has adopted, through resolution or other official act,the community development and housing plan referenced in paragraph (p)(6)(ii)of this section. A copy of the adopted plan should be made available toFmHA. While it is not necessary that the downtown redevelopment/revitalizationarea be formally designated as an urban renewal or other similar area,evidence supporting a local determination that the downtown business areameets the criteria established in the community development and housingplan must be maintained in the locality's records. Documentation receivedfrom the local governing body must also identify the site or structureinvolved in the applicant's RRH proposal as part of or essential to thedowntown redevelopment/revitalization area.(iv) Evidence must be presented to FmHA verifying the intended commitmentof public and private resources which will be available for completingany other integrally related redevelopment/revitalization activities beingundertaken in the downtown business area along with the applicant's proposedRRH project.(v) Prior review and concurrence must be received from the National Officebefore the State Director or District Director authorizes the applicantto develop a complete application.

Applicants havingeligible preapplications that do not rank high enough and future applicantshaving eligible preapplications will be notified using Form AD-622 of theireligibility but advised that processing priorities and current fundinglevels will not permit further processing of their preapplication at thistime. These preapplications will be ranked numerically based on their rating.As applications are approved, withdrawn or rejected and/or annual allocationsincreased which permit further authorizations, the applicant having thepreapplication with the next highest numerical ranking will be contacted.If the factors supporting the ranking still exist, authorization to developan application will be given.(B) Preapplications within the District Director's approving authoritywill be reviewed in accordance with the provisions in andSection; 1944.231(b)of this subpart. Applicants with the selected preapplications will be notifiedusing Form AD-622 of their eligibility and feasibility and advised to developan application. At this point, the District Director should provide theapplicant with a copy of the Multiple Housing Management Handbook, ExhibitB of Subpart C of Part 1930 of this chapter.(C) Selected preapplications in excess of the District Director's approvalauthority will be submitted to the State Office for review.

When preapplications are submitted to the National Office,the following information must be included in the submission:(i) The complete and properly assembled preapplication case file.(ii) The schematic or preliminary drawings and specifications, togetherwith the architectural comments and recommendations of the State Officearchitect.(iii) The information required by andSection; 1944.213(a) of this subpart.(iv) The District Director's comments and recommendations.(v) The State Director's comments and recommendations.(4) In States that allocate funds to districts, the State Director willnotify the District Director of the review results. The State Directorwill return the preapplication and the executed original Form FmHA 1940-21or Exhibit H of Subpart G of Part 1940 of this chapter, as appropriate,to the District Office with authorization for the District Director toprepare and issue Form AD-622.(5) In States that do not allocate funds to districts, the State Directorshould proceed as follows:(i) After reviewing the priority rating of the preapplication, the StateDirector should rank and record the points earned on Form FmHA 1905-11.This form will be maintained in the State Office.(ii) The State Director will select the highest ranking preapplicationsup to the prescribed processing levels for the State. Applicants havingeligible preapplications that do not rank high enough and future applicantshaving eligible preapplication will be notified through the district office,using Form AD-622, of their eligibility but advised that processing prioritiesand current funding levels will not permit further processing of theirpreapplications at this time. These preapplications will be ranked numericallybased on their rating. As applications are approved, withdrawn or rejectedand/or annual allocations increased which permit further authorizations,the applicant having the preapplication with the next highest numericalranking will be contacted. If the factors supporting the ranking stillexist, authorization to develop an application will be given.(iii) The State Director will return the preapplication and the reviewresults to the district office. For selected preapplications, the StateDirector will execute the original Form FmHA 1940-21 or Exhibit H of SubpartG of Part 1940 of this chapter, as appropriate, with authorization forthe District Director to prepare and issue Form AD-622.(c)<T3> Summary. </T3>The District Director will prepare Form AD-622, statingthe results of the review. The original will be signed and delivered tothe applicant, with a copy to the applicant's case file and a copy to theState Director.(1) Applicants with preapplications which are not favorably consideredwill be notified in writing of the reasons why the request was not favorablyconsidered and informed in accordance with Subpart B of Part 1900 of thischapter that they may request a further review of this decision.(2) Applicants with preapplications which are eligible and feasible, butare unable to be selected for further processing, will be notified thattheir preapplications were determined eligible but lacked sufficient priorityto authorize further processing at the present time. Applicants shouldbe advised that their preapplication will be retained and considered forfuture funding based on its rating. If funding is not authorized withinone year from the date of the Form AD-622, applicants will be notifiedin writing that their preapplication will no longer be considered unlessit is resubmitted or updated. In addition, until loan funds are available,applicants will be advised against incurring obligations for legal, architecturaland engineering work, perfecting interests in land rights and invitingconstruction bids or making other commitments which cannot be fulfilledwithout loan funds.(3) When an applicant is notified to proceed with an application, the DistrictDirector should establish specific deadlines for developing the proposalto avoid unreasonable delays by applicants not prepared to proceed. Inaddition, the following paragraph should be contained on or attached toForm AD-622:(i) ``The review action taken by FmHA is based on representations madein your preapplication presented to FmHA. Any changes in approximate projectcosts, size or scope of the project, rental rates to the tenants or subsidycosts to the Government, scope of services, sources of funds, or any othersignificant changes in the project or applicant must be reported to andapproved by FmHA in writing.''(ii) ``Any changes not approved by FmHA will be cause for FmHA to discontinueprocessing the application.''

During this processing, thefollowing actions should be taken:(1) The applicant must execute the appropriate loan agreement or loan resolutionrequired in accordance with andSection; 1944.215(f) of this subpart.(2) FmHA will obtain closing instructions from OGC in accordance with therequirements of Part 1807 of this chapter (FmHA Instruction 427.1) andandSection; 1944.236(a) and andSection; 1944.246(b)(4) of this subpart.(3) Unless initial operating and maintenance capital is included in theloan, the applicant will furnish evidence of the deposit of initial operatingand maintenance capital into the general fund account of the project.(4) The applicant will provide evidence indicating the terms and finalarrangements for interim financing.(b) <T3>Transfer of obligations. </T3>The transfer of fund obligations mayoccur only when:(1) <T3>Organizational entity remains the same. </T3>The entity remains legallythe same but a substitution of the members occurs.

Interim financing will be obtained to preclude the necessityfor multiple advances of FmHA funds. Interim financing will be used subjectto the following:(i) FmHA will proceed as if FmHA funds had been advanced from the standpointof approving construction contracts, inspection of construction and assuringcompliance with applicable equal opportunity and nondiscrimination.(ii) The guide letter shown as Exhibit B of this subpart will be used toinform a proposed interim lender that a specified amount of funds havebeen obligated and will be available to retire the interim financing ifthe applicant complies with the approval conditions, the builder's performanceis acceptable and all construction bills are paid.(iii) Since FmHA's commitment to the applicant is contingent upon acceptableperformance by the builder and payment of all construction bills, the interimlender should be advised of the additional risk involved if the builderis unable to provide, or the interim lender does not require a paymentand performance bond. Although partial payments to the builder constructingthe project by the contract method of construction must be made in accordancewith the approved construction contract, the interim lender should notbe permitted to make disbursements of more than 90 percent of the valueof acceptable work in place.(iv) Any cash for land purchase or development that is to be furnishedby the applicant in fulfillment of the applicant's contribution requirementin andSection; 1944.213(a)(2) of this subpart must be placed on deposit withthe interim lender and disbursed prior to any disbursement of interim loanfunds. Obligations incurred prior to loan closing and the start of constructionwill be handled in accordance with andSection; 1944.213(c).(v) A supervised bank account need not be established for funds obtainedthrough interim financing except for any small amounts held to completeconstruction so loan funds can be fully advanced and AED can be established.However, in order to assure that funds are requested and used for authorizedpurposes, requests for partial payments will be submitted through the DistrictDirector on Form FmHA 1924-18, ``Partial Payment Estimate,'' or other professionallyrecognized form containing the certifications of the architect, applicantand FmHA representative shown on Form FmHA 1924-18. For recordkeeping purposes,Form FmHA 402-2, ``Statement of Deposits and Withdrawals,'' should be usedto record the deposit of applicant funds for construction with the interimlender and payments of estimates where FmHA has approved the estimate.(vi) When the project is substantially complete, the FmHA loan may be scheduledfor closing. A project is substantially complete when it is possible, inaccordance with any contract documents, applicable State or local codesor ordinances and the FmHA approved drawings and specifications, to permitsafe and convenient occupancy and use of the buildings. Upon substantialcompletion, the owner's architect must issue a dated and signed statementcertifying to substantial completion. The owner's architect will also prepareand verify a punch list of any minor items of development that need tobe corrected and completed.(vii) The FmHA loan may be closed, permanent instruments issued to evidencethe FmHA indebtedness and FmHA loan funds used to retire the interim indebtednesswhen the project is substantially complete and all bills have been paid.To evidence that there are no unpaid obligations outstanding in connectionwith the project, the applicant must submit to the District Director, ator prior to loan closing, signed statements from the contractor, architect,engineer and attorney indicating that obligations for material, labor orservices have been paid in full in accordance with their contracts or otheragreements, less any funds withheld for minor punch list items. Form FmHA1924-10, ``Release by Claimants,'' or other similar form may be used forthis purpose. If these statements cannot be obtained, the loan may be closedif all of the following can be met:(A) Statements to the extent possible are obtained.(B) The interests of FmHA can be adequately protected and its securityposition is not impaired.(C) Adequate provisions are made for paying the unpaid accounts by withholdingor escrowing sufficient funds to pay such claims or obtaining a releasebond.(2) <T3>Multiple advances of RRH loan funds. </T3>If interim financing is notavailable and the applicant supplies such evidence, multiple advances willbe used subject to the following:(i) In cases where relatively large amounts of funds are to be expendedfor purchases of real estate or for other reasons at the time of closing,separate checks for these purposes may be ordered and endorsed by the borrowerto the seller or other appropriate party. This will preclude the necessityfor depositing these loan funds in the supervised bank account and reducethe amount of required collateral.(ii) Except as indicated in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, advanceswill be made only as needed to cover disbursements required by the borrowerfor a 30-day period. Normally, there should be no more than 24 advances.These advances should generally be used within 2 years of loan closing.The retained percentage withheld from the contract to assure that constructionwill be completed in accordance with the contract documents will ordinarilybe included in the last advance. Advances will be requested in sufficientamounts to insure that ample funds will be on hand to pay costs of construction,land purchase, legal, engineering or architectural costs, interest andother expenses as needed. The borrower will prepare Form FmHA 440-11, ``Estimateof Funds Needed for 30-day Period Commencing <T2>XXXXXXX</T2>,'' modified as needed, to show the amount of funds requiredduring the 30-day period. This form will be approved by the District Directoror his/her designee.(iii) After it is determined that the estimate prepared by the borroweris adequate, the advance will be requested through field office terminalsin accordance with the MFH user procedure. As an example, for a loan of$100,000, the advances may be made as follows: Assuming that the loan willbe closed on July 1, the borrower will complete Form FmHA 440-11 in sufficienttime so that the funds will be available on the day of loan closing. Theestimates should be broken down for the first advance in a manner similarto the following:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,i1,s50,8</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Construction<D>$30,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Land Acquisition<D>5,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Architectural<D>4,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Legal<D>1,000</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total</ITAG><D>$40,000</D></ITAG>An advance of $40,000 would then be available on July 1, the date of loanclosing.(iv) The second advance is also based on the borrower's estimate preparedon Form FmHA 440-11 which must be prepared in sufficient time so that theestimated amount of funds will be available on August 1. This estimateof funds might be broken down as follows: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,i1,s50,8 </C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Construction <D>$20,000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Architectural <D>1,000</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D>$21,000</D></ITAG> (v) When the project is substantially complete in accordance with andSection;1944.235(c)(i)(vi), schedule final payment to the contractor for disbursement.Withhold funds over the amount needed to cover the costs for correctingor completing the minor items identified from the contractor's final paymentin accordance with the requirements of Subpart A to Part 1924 of this chapteruntil full performance. Any funds withheld should be deposited in the supervisedbank account so the loan can be fully advanced and AED can be established.(vi) If funds remain after the loan is fully disbursed and AED has beenreached, they must be put into a supervised bank account. The funds cannotbe returned on the loan to be drawn later since AMAS will treat as a refund.(vii) Any deviation from the multiple advance procedure must have the priorapproval of the National Office. (d) <T3>Requesting the check. </T3>When loan approval conditions can be met,including any real estate lien required, and a date for FmHA loan closinghas been agreed upon, the District Director will determine the amount offunds needed in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.The District Director or his/her designee will then order the loan checkthrough field office terminals so that it will be available on or justbefore the date set for loan closing. (e) <T3>Increase or decrease in the amount of the loan. </T3> (1) If it is necessary to increase the amount of the loan within <T3>the same fiscal year </T3>but before loan closing, the loan approvingofficial or District Director will request that all distributed docketforms be returned to the district office. The loan docket will be revisedaccordingly and reprocessed provided no funds have been disbursed. TheState Office, through a field office terminal, must deobligate the existingobligation and enter the new amount to be obligated. (2) If it is necessary to increase the amount of the loan in <T3>the next fiscal year </T3>but before loan closing, the District Directormust process a subsequent loan for the amount of increase. (3) If it is necessary to decrease the amount of the loan before closing,the deobligation will be processed through field office terminals. (f) <T3>Cancellation of the loan. </T3>Loans may be canceled after approvaland before loan closing in accordance with instructions on the Form ManualInsert (FMI) for Form FmHA 1944-53, ``Multiple Family Housing Cancellationof U.S. Treasury Check and/or Obligation.'' (1) <T3>Treasury check method. </T3>If the loan check is received in the DistrictOffice, the District Director will return the check to the Finance Officewith an original and one copy of Form FmHA 1944-53, unless it was issuedby the National Finance Center (NFC). If the check was issued by NFC, cancelunder FmHA Instruction 2024-P (available in any FmHA Office). (2) <T3>Electronic wire transfer method. </T3>The District Director shouldrequest the financial institution to mark it ``void'' and issue a checkpayable to FmHA.

Introduction</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Most areas in rural America need more adequate rental housing.Some people with modest incomes live in impoverished housing that is coldin the winter and hot in the summer because adequate housing at a reasonablerent is not available. Other households that prefer to rent have the choiceof either commuting many miles to work or living in the substandard rentalhousing that is available in small rural communities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. To help reduce this rental housing shortage, the Farmers Home Administration(FmHA) finances rental housing in rural communities. Nonprofit organizations,other types of organizations and individuals may qualify for loans. Informationabout these loans is available at the local FmHA office.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. This handbook will assist interested persons and groups in applyingfor a Rural Rental Housing (RRH) loan. It also briefly explains requirementsregarding the construction and operation of the rental housing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">D. The basic guidelines in this handbook apply to all applicants;however, some requirements will vary depending on the size of the projectand whether the applicant is a nonprofit organization, other type of organizationor an individual.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">E. The objective of the RRH loan program is to provide credit forrental housing that serves the needs of eligible very low-, low-, and moderate-incomepermanent tenants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">F. Successful rental housing depends on the existence of the followingthree important conditions:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. There must be a need for the rental housing to be built.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The housing must fit the needs of prospective tenants from thestandpoint of location, design and cost.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The applicant must provide good management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">G. An applicant for a loan must provide adequate information to FmHAto show that these basic conditions can be met.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">II. Applying For a Loan</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. An individual, organization or group organizing to provide housingmay apply for an RRH loan through the local FmHA District Director servingthe area where the housing will to be located.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. The applicant should read Subpart E of Part 1944 of this chapterbefore applying for a loan. The applicant also should discuss the proposedhousing with the District Director before completing a preapplication.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. Applying for a loan with Form AD-621, ``Preapplication for FederalAssistance.'' Included with the preapplication form should be the supportingmaterial or information listed in Exhibit A-6. This information will enableFmHA to determine:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The eligibility of the applicant;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The feasibility (economic, environmental and architectural) ofthe proposed housing; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Whether the proposed housing can appropriately be financed by FmHA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">D. This information usually can be furnished by the applicant withouthiring extensive professional services. It should be factual and specificbased on objective investigations and realistic estimates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">III. Review of the Preapplication</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. If the proposal exceeds the District Director's approval authority,he/she will submit the docket to the FmHA State Director for consideration.If the proposal exceeds the State Director's approval authority, he/shewill send the docket, including comments and recommendations of the Districtand State Office staffs, to the FmHA National Office in Washington, DCfor review.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. The completeness and accuracy of information submitted with thepreapplication is especially important when reviews are necessary by FmHAoffices remote to the proposed site and without direct knowledge of conditionsand circumstances involved with the project. The description of the plannedhousing must be clear, complete, and concise to ensure timely reviews byFmHA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. When the reviews are completed, the District Director will notifythe applicant, using Form AD-622, ``Notice of Preapplication Review Action,''of FmHA's decision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If it appears a loan can be made, the District Director will explainthe additional steps that will be required. If favorable action cannotbe taken on the preapplication, the District Director will explain whyand may be able to suggest changes to permit a loan to be made.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">IV. Developing the Loan Docket</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. When an applicant is authorized to submit a formal application,the District Director will review the items required in Exhibit A-8. Theamount of information required will vary based on the complexity and sizeof the proposed project. The District Director will also provide formsand guides to assist the applicant in recording required information. Someof the guides are included as exhibits in this handbook. The applicantis responsible for providing the information required.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The District Director will assemble this information and completethe docket.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. The following information will be helpful in developing a loandocket. The first two items are applicable only to nonprofit organizations.The other items apply to any applicant. In addition, the requirements ofExhibit A-6 of this instruction must be met when developing a preapplicationand the requirements of Exhbit A-8 must be met with developing an application.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Getting organized if applicant is a nonprofit organization and hasnot adopted articles of incorporation and bylaws.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Sterring committee. </T3>The group may choose a steering committeeto act for it. An attorney will usually be required to advise the organizationon incorporation and assist in developing the loan application. The steeringcommittee should select an attorney who is interested in the proposed housingand will render the necessary services promptly for a reasonable fee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Articles of incorporation and bylaws. </T3>FmHA has developed modelarticles of incorporation and bylaws for nonprofit organizations. The steeringcommittee should arrange for the District Director to meet with the attorney.The District Director will give the attorney copies of the FmHA model articlesof incorporation and bylaws and explain FmHA requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Attorney's fees. </T3>Reasonable attorney's fees may be included inthe FmHA loan. A written agreement between the applicant and attorney isrequired. See Exhibit A-1 for a sample copy of an agreement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Board of directors. </T3>The steering committee usually selects theincorporators for the corporation. The board of directors is responsiblefor conducting the corporation's business, including obtaining the loanand providing overall management after the housing is completed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Obtaining broadly based membership.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. A nonprofit corporation applying for a loan must have and maintaina broadly based local membership, including leaders in the community, representinga variety of interests in the community. The members may be individualsor organizations but each member is limited to one vote.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The purpose of the broadly based membership requirement is to obtaincommunity support, provide enough members to be able to rotate officersand members of the board of directors, protect the Government's financialinterest as mortgagee and provide assurance that the housing will be asuccess and the purpose of the loan carried out.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. In RRH loans to nonprofit organizations and public bodies, thereis no profit incentive. The term of the loan may be for as long as 50 years.Therefore, factors such as the prospect for continuous competent managementand supervision, maintenance and adequate community support of the housingproject over the expected life of the loan are important.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. A membership list showing the names and addresses of each membershould be maintained by the secretary of the organization.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Number of members required. </T3>The organization should have at least25 members. The number of members may be decreased for projects with lessthan 25 units.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Contributions by members. </T3>Nonprofit corporations may require amembership fee or ask prospective members for a contribution. This is themethod often used by nonprofit corporation applicants to raise initialoperating capital. However, no such fee or contribution can entitle a memberor prospective member to a preference in occupany of the housing.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The applicant should communicate with officials of the communityearly in the development of the proposal to explain the benefits of theproposed housing to the community. This meeting will serve to remove theuncertainty of the impact of the housing on the community and may aid ina timely processing of the preapplication. The support of community officialsis helpful in obtaining environmental clearances, possible zoning changes,favorable taxation, etc.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Initial operating capital.  </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. All applicants must have enough initial operating capital to getstarted. When justified, FmHA may include these funds in a loan made toa nonprofit organization or public body. Initial operating capital shouldbe sufficient to pay such costs as property and liability insurance premiums,fidelity bond premiums when the applicant is an organziation, utility hook-upcharges and deposits, maintenance and other equipment, lease forms, furnishings,loan payments that may become due during construction, and other initialexpenses.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. At least 2 percent of the total development cost of the projectis required for initial operation and maintenance costs. The applicantcan determine the amount required by working out a detailed budget of incomeand expenses for the period of time until the housing is ready for occupanyand rental income will be available. The actual budget may indicate thatmore than 2 percent is needed.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Analysis of market to determine demand for rental housing.  </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Applicants should discuss with the Distict Director the type ofmarket analysis that will be needed. Applicants must comply with paragraphII of Exhibit A-6 when preparing market information.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Exhibits A-3 and A-4 are sample forms which may be modified bythe applicant to assist in the assembly of the information for the marketanalysis.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Planning to serve the market.  </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Planning the housing to serve the market in the community involvesmore than obtaining a blueprint of the building. It requires a carefulevaluation of conditions in the community and careful planning to assurethat the result will be good rental housing designed for independent, livingat a cost eligible tenants can afford. Well planned housing is:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Convenient, attractive, safe, and comfortable.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Easily maintained.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Located where its tenants can have easy access to the goods andservices they require for daily living.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Planned to meet all codes, regulations, and acceptable constructionpractices.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Priced to rent for no more than the prospective tenants can afford. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) Energy efficient and complies with FmHA's thermal performancestandards.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The District Director and State Office architect can provide informationthat will help the applicant in planning the housing.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>Selecting an architect.  </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The services of an architect are required for all housing projectswhich have more than five units. The cost of a registered architect/engineermay be included in the loan.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Before anything more than schematic drawings are prepared, theapplicant and its architect, the FmHA architect/engineer and the DistrictDirector should arrange a meeting. This meeting will acquaint the applicant'sarchitect with the purposes of the housing and FmHA's requirements. Thiswill be helpful in eliminating misunderstandings. Among the topics thatshould be discussed are:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Objectives of the rental housing program.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Design requirements that will produce good housing at reasonablecost.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) States at which FmHA must review plans and specifications.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Services the architect will be expected to perform.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Agreement between architect and applicant.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. <T3>Selecting a site.  </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The location of the housing is an important part of planning toserve the market. Tenants should have easy access to required services.A desirable residential setting within the rural community is essential. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Site cost is also important. The total cost of the site, includingthe cost of improvements and the price of the land, must be considered.Both may be included in the loan. However, loan funds made available topurchase land may not exceed the present market value of the land in itspresent condition as determined by an FmHA appraisal.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Before buying a site, the applicant should consult the architectto determine the suitability of the site for the proposed housing. Theapplicant must consider the site requirements detailed in paragraph IIIof Exhibit A-6 of this subpart. The applicant should not enter into anyfirm agreement to buy a site with the expectation of receiving an FmHAloan without consulting with the District Director and prior to the Agency'scompletion of the environmental impact review.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. <T3>Drawings, specifications and cost estimates.  </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The size, complexity, and cost of rental housing projects can varyfrom a duplex located on a small building lot to a complex of buildingslocated on a site containing several acres. The applicant must providedrawings and specifications in accordance with paragraph IV of ExhibitA-6 of this instruction.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10. <T3>Budgets.  </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The initial budget should cover the period from the date the firstconstruction expenses are incurred until the end of the applicant's firstfiscal year following completion of the housing. After the final cost estimatehas been made and the amount of the loan needed has been determined, abudget for a typical year should be developed.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. This budget should be based on a typical annual operation afterthe project is occupied. Budgeting is an important part of the management.The applicant should spend enough time working on it to assure that theestimates are realistic. Budgets will be required each year until the FmHAloan is repaid in full.

How the survey is performedcan influence the outcome; therefore, it is encumbent upon you to see thatthe manner in which it is conducted is suitable and acceptable to FmHA.For instance, compensation being paid to someone for survey work shouldnot be dependent upon the number of respondents who would be willing tomove into the project. The survey should be based on a random samplingof persons now residing in the market area.

Also persons with lower incomes will moveinto projects even though they will pay more than 30 percent of their incomes.Irrespective of these considerations, the study will need to show the entirescale of incomes from lowest to highest.
