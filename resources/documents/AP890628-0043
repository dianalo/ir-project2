But the unit could not overcome the ugly, politically chargedscandal of the 1984 murder of Manuel Buendia, a front-page columnistand author who specialized in exposing wrongdoing in high places.   Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis ordered the intelligence policedisbanded Tuesday after three commanders were charged in the tangledassassination plot.   He called their involvement ``intolerable.''   The three commanders served under the alleged mastermind of theBuendia killing, Jose Antonio Zorrilla Perez, former director of thenow-defunct Federal Security Administration.   Zorrilla, whose FBI-like agency was disbanded for corruption in1985, is accused of ordering Buendia killed to stop the columnistfrom exposing his links to drug lords.   The commanders _ Juventino Prado Hurtado, Sofia Naya Suarez andRaul Perez Carmona _ have all said they were tortured intoconfessing their participation in what was code-named ``OperationNews.''   Corruption and brutality are old, agonizing and acknowledgedproblems among the low-paid, poorly trained Mexican police. Whenreputed drug kingpin Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo was arrestedearlier this year, the entire local police force in his hometown ofCuliacan was rounded up along with him.   But even in a country where some fear cops as much as criminals,Mexico City's intelligence police were regarded as particularlydangerous.   Critics said their main business was extortion.   ``This is the fundamental reason they detain people,'' Rep.Victor Orduna, chairman of the Justice Administration Committee ofthe capital's city council, said in a recent interview.   Orduna and Rep. Ramon Sosamontes, chairman of the council'sPublic Safety Committee, say scores of citizens complained ofdetention in clandestine jails, torture and extortion.   Human rights organizations and lawyers reported similarcomplaints.   Some were verbal, others were filed with the city or the courts.All were still pending when Camacho Solis finally ordered the unitdismantled.   Critics of the intelligence police had been hoping the taint ofthe Buendia murder, a crime that shocked the nation and galvanized atimid press into prodding two successive administrations forjustice, would accomplish what the complaints of ordinary peoplefailed to do.   ``They are virtually gone,'' human rights lawyer Maria TeresaJardi told the AP after Zorrilla was indicted.   By most accounts, the Intelligence Division was a crime-fightingidea that went badly awry.   High-ranking police sources who insisted on anonymity said someof the roughest agents and officers in Zorrilla's disbanded SecurityAdministration were chosen for the intelligence police.   The sources admitted privately that the attempt to harness thoseelements had created a monster.   ``In Mexican police circles there is this idea to controldelinquents, you need a worse delinquent,'' Orduna said. ``But thisdivision became a social problem for the city.''   The intelligence police had image problems from it outset latelast year. Its original director was Miguel Nazar Haro, Zorrilla'spredecessor at the Security Administration and a veteran of theharsh political repression of the 1970s.   The appointment created an uproar.   The Mexican Academy of Human Rights produced several people whotestified that Nazar Haro had personally tortured them. The presspointed out that he was still wanted by authorities in Calfornia ona federal indictment alleging he was in a ring that stole hundredsof autos and smuggled them across the border.   Officials of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's newadministration staunchly defended Nazar Haro as a smart veteran copand tough crime-fighter.   ``We're simply trying to fight crime,'' Police Chief JavierGarcia Paniagua said at the time. ``And we will be forceful.''   The division's image took another sharp blow when its agentshelped quell a December prison riot 500 miles from Mexico City, inTepic. A videotape viewed by The Associated Press revealed that sixinmates died after surrendering.   Nazar Haro resigned in late February but the intelligence policewere back in the headlines within weeks after agents detained ninewomen on the way home from an illegal abortion clinic.   Several of the women say they were beaten and their doctor wastortured before their release without charges 14 hours later.   Sosamontes and Orduna said the incident, which the police refusedto discuss, was designed to extort ``protection'' money from theelderly doctor. They say he paid a substantial sum.   The March abortion clinic incident prompted more demands for thedivision's disbanding. City officials agreed instead to close itsinfamous jail, Tlaxcoaque.   Orduna said the closure created even more problems.   ``Before, I knew where to look for people,'' he said recently.``Now I don't know where to go. They say there are four newclandestine jails, but we don't know precisely where they are.''</TEXT></DOC>
