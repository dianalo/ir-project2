The executive director of Iowa's GOP says she got no reaction at all to the address and &quot;had to solicit comments.&quot; But Reagan's low-key talk, combined with his and Congress's vacations, should help cool the issue. While questions will resurface at next month's press conference and after Walsh's likely indictments, other issues -- Bork, arms control, Central America -- will absorb more public attention by then.    Reagan aides think Bork is a sure-win issue, even in the unlikely event he is rejected; the Democrats look clumsy, while Reagan can energize his conservative base. Likewise, they view arms control as no-lose politically. House Majority Leader Foley complains that Reagan goes &quot;into a clinch&quot; on Central America by saying he is for the Contras and for peace at the same time.    Hoping that Iran-Contra is finally going away, one Reagan adviser says: &quot;Never underestimate the short attention span of the media.&quot;    ADMINISTRATION EAGERNESS for a summit worries critics on the right.    Reagan hopes for a Thanksgiving summit with Gorbachev, but the thinning ranks of administration hard-liners worry that the White House is growing too eager to get it. They say the U.S. must be especially tough at the tail end of arms talks. But their pleas are weakened by the absence of departed Pentagon aide Perle and the impending exit of negotiator Adelman.    Hard-liners are particularly alarmed at the lack of U.S. hue and cry over new Soviet deployments of SS-24 mobile missiles. But the administration still says it won't budge on Soviet demands that it give up 72 Pershing 1-A West German missiles with U.S. warheads.    STANDING PAT: The Fed won't ease, despite a stronger dollar.    One policy maker says the central bank, which nudged up interest rates in the spring to support a falling currency, has no plans to back off now. The dollar's recent rise mostly reflects troubles in the Persian Gulf; high bond yields suggest that inflation fears remain.    Anxious to prove his inflation-fighting bona fides, Greenspan is reluctant to ease now. Bullish economic news bolsters his case. Reports on second-quarter output and employment show stronger growth than many had expected. The economy &quot;looks better than the scoffers have been claiming,&quot; says Commerce official Ortner.    But continued improvement in the trade situation is vital; figures due out today will provide an important clue.    DUKAKIS FACES growing pressure and criticism as he surges in the Democratic presidential race. His hometown Boston Globe editorializes that he is too vague on many issues and that he sounds &quot;like a Pavlovian pinball machine&quot; on defense. Some Dukakis boosters fear he may try too hard to pander to liberal activists in Iowa.    HOSTAGE-TAKING: Northeastern senators serve notice they will delay the reconfirmation of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairwoman, Martha Hesse, until Reagan renominates pro-consumer Commissioner Charles Stalon as well. Some congressional aides say the panel is loaded with supporters of natural-gas producers.    NUNN RUN? Despite Sen. Nunn's impressive performance in the Iran-Contra hearings, doubts persist about a possible presidential race. Democratic insiders say a regional-based strategy eschewing Iowa and New Hampshire can't succeed, and they warn that a poor showing could cost Nunn a shot at being vice president or secretary of state or defense in any Democratic administration.    NO MONKEY BUSINESS: Reporters chasing rumors of a yacht named &quot;Princess St Germain&quot; find no link to the House Banking chairman. A now-insolvent Texas thrift did lend $180,000 to Princess St. Germain Inc., a Delaware corporation and owner of an 88-foot Italian-built yacht named &quot;Sincerity.&quot; But the French owners named the company after the St. Germain district in Paris.    RUDER'S AGENDA as SEC chairman differs from predecessor Shad's.    While pledging to continue the crackdown on insider traders, the new chairman also signals a get-tough policy on broker-dealer abuses. Says a Senate staffer: &quot;He clearly put it at the top of his priorities; how he puts his words into practice remains to be seen.&quot;    With a newly bolstered budget, the former Northwestern law professor is likely to rely less on the exchanges and state regulators to regulate broker practices and go after individual violators. Ruder won't advocate significant changes in takeover laws but will insist on vigorous enforcement of existing tender-offer rules.    He is also expected to support deregulatory efforts to help make U.S. markets, securities firms and businesses more competitive internationally.    MINOR MEMOS: At a breakfast with reporters, Weinberger dubs House Armed Services chairman Aspin &quot;the defense secretary of a foreign government.&quot; . . . Memos from Justice Antonin Scalia pointing out issues in forthcoming cases are dubbed &quot;Ninograms&quot; by some justices and law clerks. . . . Looking on the dark side, three Stanford academics report that Social Security faces hundreds of billions of dollars in additional outlays because of the declining percentage of smokers; people who live longer collect more benefits. </TEXT></DOC>
