A member of the ruling Communist Politburo said the first freeelections in four decades could be held within a year.   Voting with the somber, mechanical gestures born of decades ofrubberstamp approval of Communist measures, the 309 deputiesunanimously scrapped Article 4 of the constitution, which mandatedthe leading role of the Communist Party. They also deleted a clausethat bases all education on Marxism-Leninism.   ``The revolution is proceeding much quicker than we expected,''said Jiri Dienstbier, spokesman for the Civic Forum opposition,minutes after the vote was broadcast live on national television.   The changes were among historic concessions the opposition wonfrom the Communist government on Tuesday when Premier LadislavAdamec also promised to form a new government, includingnon-Communists, by Sunday.   They followed 11 straight days of huge anti-governmentdemonstrations, which culminated in a two-hour strike on Monday inwhich millions of workers participated.   Adamec went on national TV and said he had asked Civic Forum forits suggestions on who to include in the new government. He alsosaid he would negotiate a reassessment of the 1968 Warsaw Pactinvasion that crushed reforms.   Civic Forum proposed that the new Defense Minister be a civilianCommunist, and the Interior Minister, who controls the police, be acivilian non-Communist, Dienstbier said.   Parliament also eliminated the Communists' leading position inthe National Front, an umbrella organization embracing allpolitical parties and social groups allowed in Czechoslovakia. Fourdeputies opposed the measure and 16 abstained.   Shortly after the historic votes, state TV showed Slovak actorMilan Knazko announcing word of the changes to a packed NationalTheater in Bratislava, capital of Slovakia. The entire audience,which included prominent dissident Vaclav Havel, rose to its feetin thunderous, minute-long applause.   Parliament also planned to consider creating a constitutionalcourt and a commission to investigate allegations of policebrutality in a crackdown on protesters Nov. 17.   The removal of the requirement that Marxism-Leninism be theguiding principle of education was a prime demand of students whostaged the Nov. 17 protest and have led the pro-democracy movementsince.   In parliamentary debate, broadcast live on TV for the firsttime, deputies openly admitted past party failures and said theCommunists must work hard to win the people's confidence.   ``We have betrayed the trust of the electorate, and whateverlaws we pass today will not change this,'' said Blanka Hykova ofthe Socialist Party, until recently a docile ally of the Communists.   Anton Blazej, dean of a Communist Party training academy, said:``We have misunderstood the leading role of the party and itsposition. We must regain this trust.''   Defense Minister Milan Vaclavik, a member of Parliament, soundeda cautionary note: ``I am aware that neither the army nor the partyhave the best position now. We should be aware that retreats andcompromises are necessary, but there are limits.''   Alois Indra, who said Tuesday he was quitting as Parliamentpresident, delivered a formal speech of resignation to the350-member chamber.   He described the resignation as ``a logical step in the contextof the present developments.''   Indra was said to be among party leaders who requested theSoviet-led invasion of August 1968 that crushed the ``PragueSpring'' of reform instituted by Alexander Dubcek, then CommunistParty chief.   Bretislav Nedbalek, secretary of a preparatory committee, saidCzechoslovakia's Social Democratic Party had been re-establishedafter an absence of 41 years.   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II prayed that Czechoslovakiawould use its Christian traditions in building its ``new future.''   About 5,000 people attended a Communist-sponsored rallyWednesday at Ostrava, an industrial city near the Polish border,including supporters of the opposition group Civic Forum.   Senek Milota, a local party leader, told the rally, ``We don'twant to eat soup from a charity kitchen,'' an apparent reference tothe party giving up power. Civic Forum backers jeered loudly, butno trouble was reported.   Vasil Mohorita of the party's ruling Politburo said Wednesdaythat free elections could be held within a year, now that theCommunist Party has agreed to relinquish its monopoly on power.   Mohorita, the first member of the new leadership to face theinternational press, was asked a news conference when Czechoslovakswould have a chance to vote freely, and replied:   ``First, it is necessary to change the laws. Most probably itwill take place within a year. We don't want the monopoly of oneparty to continue.''   Party chief Karel Urbanek said Tuesday the Communists were readyto give up their exclusive control.   Despite repeated questions, Mohorita did not say specificallythe party would hand over control if it lost free elections, but hestressed several times: ``We're a different party now, and you allshould get used to it.''   He conceded the new party leadership chosen last week is underpressure from its own 1.7 million members as well as theopposition, and said a special party congress tentatively set forJan. 26 might have to be held sooner.   At a closed meeting of 3,500 party activists Tuesday night,Urbanek said ``the future of the party requires giving up themonopoly of power'' amd many opposition demands are acceptable, theofficial news agency CTK reported.   Differences exist, he added, but ``we shall have to get used tomaking politics not only with those who agree with you.''   Urbanek said Civic Forum's demands that the the party disbandthe People's Militia, its private army, and get out of theworkplace were ``totally unacceptable,'' however.   Civic Forum has also demanded the resignation of PresidentGustav Husak by Dec. 10. Husak, who is closely associated withDubcek's ouster, was quoted on the state news agency CTK as sayinghe was unwilling to step down before his current five-year term,his third as President, ends in May.</TEXT></DOC>
