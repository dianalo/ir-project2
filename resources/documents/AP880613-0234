Atlanta,the capital of the New South, full of bustle and expansive withcivic pride, is host to its first national party convention. Thedelegates will find their attention firmly directed to the city'sfuture rather than the magnolia past.</TEXT><BYLINE>By HUGH A. MULLIGAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrats arriving at the nation's busiestairport for their quadrennial political binge will find theantebellum South not only gone with the wind but without theprospect of a sequel.   Delegates looking for nostalgic flashbacks to crinolinepetticoats and hoop skirts, moonlight and magnolias in modernAtlanta will just be whistling Dixie from memory and with no helpat all from the convention podium.   ``You won't hear Dixie and you won't see any Confederate flagsat this convention,'' vows Don Fowler, a political scienceprofessor from South Carolina who is the convention's chiefexecutive officer. ``Today's Atlanta is a vibrant, dynamic city ofthe future, which makes it an ideal host for the party of thefuture.''   The Stars and Bars won't be quite out of sight. The Georgialegislature put off until after the convention a battle overredesigning the state flag, now three-quarters occupied by theConfederate battle flag.   While the chaos in Chicago at the '68 convention has not beenentirely forgotten, the power structure in this Sun Belt city isn'tgreatly worried about unruly demonstrations when the convention isgaveled to order on July 18.   ``We shouldn't have any trouble with demonstrations, mainlybecause everybody running this city has been organizing them for 20years,'' allows Andrew Young, the super-cool chief salesman forAtlanta, who in that two decade-span has moved from the ranks ofcivil rights marchers outside city hall to the mayor's officeinside.   The site selection committee, of course, was sold the newAtlanta, which has just passed Chicago and New York as the nation'sleading convention and trade show hub, ranks as the thirdfastest-growing high-tech center in the country and basks in itspoll ratings by the Cushman-Wakefield realty group as the nation's``most livable city.''   The ``Big Peach,'' as the locals are obliged to call thisconfusing metropolis grid linked by 23 streets, roads, boulevards,avenues and places named Peachtree, is the home of Coca-Cola, DeltaAirlines, Turner Cable News Network, Georgia Tech, Emory andMorehouse College, the baseball Braves, basketball Hawks, footballFalcons and architect John Portman Jr., the ``atrium king,'' whowaved his T square over the decaying downtown business district andbrought forth, well, what else? Peachtree Center, 11 city blocks ofsoaring glass and aerial skywalks linking seven office towers, amall and three hotels, including the 1,674-room Marriott Marquis,the country's largest convention hotel.   Georgia's capital, with its gold leaf domed Statehouse modeledafter the nation's Capitol and once echoing with the footfalls ofEugene Talmadge, Lester Maddox and Jimmy Carter, now eagerlyprojects itself as the financial capital of the South. Youngenvisions it as ``the next great international city,'' a sort ofZurich or Duesseldorf with grit and grits.   More than 400 of Fortune's 500 corporations and five majorJapanese banks have branches in ``Hot-lanta,'' as the business boomis boosted on T-shirts and buttons that delegates will find intheir welcome bags.   Although it is on the sightseeing agenda for delegate spouses,the site selection committee was steered away from Stone Mountain,the Confederate Mount Rushmore, where the equestrian figures ofStonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee gallop acrosstwo football fields of solid granite in the world's largestbas-relief sculpture against a sound track of Elvis Presley moaning``Dixie.''   ``Stonewall Jackson got run out of town long ago,'' laughed cabdriver Lucian Hayer, who had just attended ``courtesy school'' andput new sheepskin seat covers in his 1976 Ford wagon in deferenceto the arriving Democrats. ``Folks around here are more intoMichael, Jesse and Maynard Jackson.''   Rock star Michael Jackson recently writhed to sellout crowds forthree nights at the Omni, the basketball arena where the Democratswill perform their nominating rites in somewhat cramped quarters.Jesse, of course, is the charismatic candidate whose clout in theprimaries could be tracked locally when his campaign headquartersmoved from a storefront to a suite of offices in a downtown bank.Maynard Jackson, Atlanta's first black mayor, is said to be poisedfor a comeback if Young runs for governor.   In keeping with Atlanta's pride of racial harmony, more touriststoday ask directions to the Martin Luther King Jr. Center, with itseternal flame, reflecting pool and the stark tomb marked ``Free AtLast,'' than to Wren House, where Joel Chandler Harris wrote ofUncle Remus and the Tar Baby.   During ``downtime'' at the first national party convention everheld here, some of the 4,126 delegates and their alternates will nodoubt attend services at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Kingfollowed his father and grandfather into the puplit.   Auburngiven to the Cyclorama, thehuge three-dimensional evocation of the 1864 battle of Atlanta,executed a century ago by German and Polish artists.   Confederate soldiers up on pedestals mostly stand sentinel thesedays over the graveyards of Atlanta, but there is a statue downtownof editor Henry Grady, who a century ago eloquently proclaimed ``anew South,'' and what may be the nation's only sculpture of NelsonMandela, South Africa's apartheid foe.   What with the Jimmy Carter Library, the High Museum of Art, afirst-rate symphony orchestra, a thriving avant-garde art colonyand the refurbishing into a concert hall of the Fox theater, thatMoorish mirage of a movie palace, Atlanta has become a culturalcenter of such compelling diversity that running back HerschelWalker recently pirouetted on stage to make his ballet debut,followed a few weeks later by Rudolf Nureyev.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
