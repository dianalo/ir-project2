Theresults show that far-infrared emission is a significant luminosity componentin the local universe, representing 25 percent of the luminosity emittedby stars in the same volume. Above 10 to the 11th solar luminosities,the infrared luminous galaxies are the dominant population of objectsin the universe, being as numerous as the Seyfert galaxies and more numerousthan quasars at higher luminosities. The infrared luminosity appearsto be independent of the optical luminosity of galaxies. Most infraredbright galaxies appear to require much of the interstellar matter tobe contributing to the observed infrared luminosity. Approximately 60-80percent of the far-infrared luminosity of the local universe can be attributed,directly or indirectly, to recent or ongoing star formation. 67 references.</TEXT></DOC>
