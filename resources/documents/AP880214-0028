Scientists are using a pair of the bulky machines, the only onesof their kind, to test dental products and conduct other kinds ofresearch.   Douglas and his colleagues can duplicate the rigors of a year ofchewing in a single day. That, he says, offers hope for vastimprovement in the quality of dental fillings and crowns and inscientists' ability to understand the forces of chewing anddigestion.   Without the new technology, Douglas explains, manufacturers musttest and prove the durability of their wares in the mouths of realsubjects. Years of grinding and chomping must go by beforeresearchers can judge a product's merit.   ``If you put this together, you have an investigative tool,''said Douglas, 50, who left a research post in Wales to do researchat the university.   ``If you have an obedient artificial mouth which is believable,you have something to enable you to approach many tough problemsthat otherwise would be very difficult to do.''   The mouth began taking shape when Douglas joined the dentalresearch staff at Minnesota in 1978. His endowed chair is partlyfunded by 3M Co., based in the St. Paul suburb of Maplewood. 3M isa leading manufacturer of fillings, crowns and other dentalproducts.   Douglas soon learned of a company, MTS Systems Corp., insuburban Eden Prairie that builds test equipment with the precisionand sophistication he needed to replicate mouth dynamics in thelaboratory.   Along with colleagues Ralph DeLong and R.L. Sakaguchi, Douglasadapted MTS equipment to build the mechanical mouths.   The next step was artificial saliva. A researcher at StateUniversity of New York at Buffalo has learned how to make it, andhe sends Douglas and company quantities to use with the mouth. Jetsshoot the saliva and other lubricants between test teeth the wayducts do in real life.   Along with the mouth, the dental researchers have developedcomputer imaging technology that maps precisely where and how teethwear out.   ``It's a very painstaking procedure right now, where you'remarking on teeth ... and measuring them,'' said Walter Poxon,international professional services manager for 3M. ``This computerimaging is the state of the art in dental materials research. Itreally does give you an accurate picture of what's happening.''   Douglas has other, more ambitious dreams for his mouth. Now, itchews only in the sense that it simulates the wear-and-tear ofchewing. He wants it to masticate fully _ to grind, break down andeven swallow food.   The next step: development of artificial tongues and cheeks.Douglas is poring over scientific papers for background while heprepares applications for National Institute of Health grants tofinance more work in that direction.   ``I want to figure out how this thing can give a good simulationof what happens in the human mouth. For that you need a tongue andcheek mechanism,'' Douglas said. ``It's very tough. It's a verydifficult thing to do.''   Douglas sees a complete artificial mouth as a research tool forfood-product development, a field in which tenderness, texture and``mouth feel'' possess tremendous importance. The artificial mouthwould be able to quantify precisely the oral effort Product X woulddemand of the consumer.   ``You have an instrument that can figure out just how muchmastication has to go into that beef,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
