Gadhafi vowed to ``meet challenge with challenge,'' JANA said ina dispatch monitored in London. The reaction came about six hoursafter the Libyan jets were shot down by aircraft from the U.S. 6thFleet.   ``In spite of the increase in official American terrorism, whichis backed by brute force, and in spite of the threats, therevolutionaries of great Libya will not bow their heads and will notabandon their principles and the objectives of their eternalmotherland of unity, liberation and the building of progress,''Gadhafi declared, according to JANA.   ``If America has prevailed because it is a superpower in the airand the sea, it will inevitably be defeated on land. We, as well asthe fish, are awaiting them,'' Gadhafi was quoted as saying.   Libya today formally requested an emergency meeting of the U.N.Security Council to condemn the U.S. action. Ali Sunni Muntasser,Libya's ambassador to the United Nations, said the Libyan planes hadbeen unarmed.   No date was set for the Security Council session.   Also today, the Yugoslavian news agency Tanjug reported Gadhafihas asked the Soviet Union to use its navy to help prevent aU.S.-Libyan clash in the Mediterranean.   Libya's Foreign Ministry said the U.S. shot down the Libyan jetfighters in a ``premeditated attack.'' And Libya's ambassador toItaly said the downing of the planes was linked to U.S. allegationsthat Libya has built a chemical weapons plant.   ``At 1103 hours (5:03 a.m. EST) while two Libyan reconnaissanceaircraft were carrying out a patrol over international waters, U.S.aircraft carried out a premeditated attack on them and shot themdown,'' Libyan radio said, quoting a statement by the ForeignMinistry in Tripoli, the Libyan capital.   White House officials said the American aircraft opened fireafter being threatened. The Pentagon reported the Soviet-builtMiG-23s were shot down by U.S. F-14s from the aircraft carrier JohnF. Kennedy in the Mediterranean. It was the first fighting betweenthe United States and Libya since U.S. jets bombed Tripoli in 1986.   Libyan Ambassador Abdel Rahman Shalgam called today's incident``a unilateral act'' and a ``dangerous'' action of escalation by theUnited States in its response to the chemical plant situation. Hedeclined to say how Libya would respond.   On Tuesday, U.S. officials said for the first time they hadevidence the plant had begun producing limited quantities ofchemical weapons.   Libyan officials, including Gadhafi, have insisted the plant nearTripoli will make pharmaceuticals and offered to let internationalexperts inspect the facility. The Reagan administration has rejectedthe offer for a one-time inspection.   Referring to the U.S. insistence that the plant is a chemicalweapons facility, Shalgam said of the U.S. administration: ``Whydon't they wait'' until the start of an international conference onchemical weapons, scheduled to begin this weekend in Paris.   ``We are willing to accept any international measure'' regardingchemical arms, he said, as long as it applied to all nations, but hesaid the United States was evidently not willing to do so.   He stressed that Libya said it would open the plant in a fewweeks for inspection ``so that the whole world could see.''</TEXT></DOC>
