The China Daily said the China Jingan Equipment Import andExport Corporation is also displaying tear gas bombs, dye bombs,submachine guns and anti-riot guns.   It quoted an official of the corporation, the only Chinese firmauthorized to deal in police equipment in China, as saying morethan 1,000 sets of anti-riot helmets and shields have already beensupplied to police in Henan, Liaoning and Tibet provinces.   Tibet is troubled by a small independence movement and tensionbetween Chinese and the local Tibetans, while there have beenreports of labor unrest in Liaoning, northeast China.   The creation of the riot police force coincides with whatChinese security officials acknowledge is a rising problem withcrime and social unrest resulting from the state's gradualloosening of political and economic controls.   In the past few years there have been riots in Tibet, studentdemonstrations calling for greater democracy, labor strikes andprotests by farmers about pollution.   Jingan official Yin Guishan said the cost of providing a riotpolice officer with a full range of equipment would be about $1,350.   He said the company is also designing China's first armoredpolice personnel carrier, a $81,000 vehicle carrying 10 people andequipped with surveillance instruments and weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
