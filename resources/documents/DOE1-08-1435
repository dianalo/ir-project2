A familiar technical solution such as fuel oil or electricalheating is often more acceptable than the less common geothermal option.Furthermore, the risk involved in buying fuel oil seems less than drillingfor hot water for heating. The driving force of most direct use projectsis the economic advantage over alternative energy sources. Principalelements of direct uses of geothermal energy are identified. The technologiesneeded to bring geofluids from resource to user are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
