Specifically, after describingthe methods used in the analysis, the report presents a discussion ofeach aspect of the model evaluation process. The adaptation of the systemto three states (Louisiana, Wyoming, and Texas) is described in lightof the three key aspects of model transfer: collection and preparationof input data, model code alterations, and resources required. The secondmajor topic discussed is the sensitivity analysis, which consisted ofevaluations of the model's ability to simulate the impact process andto show the expected the acuracy of the model. This analysis consistedof the projection of economic and demographic factors from 1970 to 1980,using data inputs for 1970, followed by comparisons of the model's projectionsto reported values from the 1980 Census and similar sources for regions,counties and cities in the three states. The analyses described in thisreport thus provide a comprehensive assessment of the SEARS methodologyand one of the most complete and comprehensive assessments ever performedof the validity of a socioeconomic assessment model. 44 refs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
