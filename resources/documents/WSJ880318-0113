Gigot </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG EXE </G><TEXT>   Surely it's a strange world in which Sen. Ted Kennedy is cast as anyone's moral arbiter, but there he went again this Wednesday. As President Reagan vetoed the Grove City bill, newspapers quoted Mr. Kennedy as denouncing this &quot;kick in the teeth of civil rights,&quot; while his special-interest sidekick, lobbyist Ralph Neas, called it &quot;a day of shame on the presidency.&quot;    Unsubtle implications of bigotry are both men's stock-in-trade, of course, but the fact that their remarks are cited as important illustrates how much America's civil-rights debate remains frozen in images from the 1950s. In a decade when Jesse Jackson is a serious candidate for the presidency, Washington debates civil rights as if it were still a battle between Rosa Parks and Bull Connor. The Reagan administration -- and this may be its single greatest failure -- has done far too little to change the terms of this debate by offering its own more positive civil-rights agenda.    On its merits, the Grove City bill deserved a veto as much as any legislation in the Reagan era. The bill is liberalism reduced to mindless legalism: In the name of a high-sounding ideal, unleash lawyers and bureaucrats to inspect the most routine decisions of private society. Businesses that have any dealing at all with the government would be subject to federal inspection, even without a specific charge of discrimination. A grocery store that accepted food stamps couldn't hire a clerk without meeting federal hiring standards. A church or synagogue that received federal aid for, say, a day-care center would have all of its hiring decisions vulnerable to lawsuits.    Genuine acts of discrimination remain covered by the great civil-rights laws of the 1960s, of course, as no one disputes they should be. And if there is any remaining loophole, the alternative bill submitted by President Reagan with his veto this week certainly covers it. Indeed, the irony of the entire Grove City debate is that no one ever accused Grove City College of discrimination in the first place. The college sued, and was vindicated by the Supreme Court, because it wanted to be free from an intruding federal bureaucracy.    But in matters of civil rights, symbolism matters as much as substance. And in Washington that debate is still framed, in essence, as the concerned vs. the callous. No wonder so many Republicans, always trying to close their &quot;compassion&quot; gap, don't want to be seen casting a vote against Grove City. No wonder Mr. Reagan's veto may yet be overridden, despite an impressive White House lobbying campaign in the past week. Until Republicans can offer an alternative agenda, they'll continue to be mugged by the special interests that set the terms of debate.    One man with a lively perspective on all this is Robert Woodson, a civil-rights activist who, from the redoubt of his tiny National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise here, keeps lobbing mortar rounds at the conventional wisdom of the civil-rights establishment. &quot;Civil rights is a threshold issue with black folks,&quot; he acknowledges, but he doesn't parrot the charges of racial bigotry.    &quot;To me the big civil-rights issue now is about the poor, not about race,&quot; says Mr. Woodson, who is black. &quot;Low-income opportunity should have been the civil-rights issue for this administration.&quot; The traditional civil-rights agenda, he says, doesn't address the problem of black family breakup, or of black economic progress. And for liberals -- witness Grove City -- every civil-rights problem can be solved with more government intervention, even though most of the black poor really want less.    Mr. Woodson says his &quot;Republican civil-rights agenda&quot; would include, among other things, tenant control of public housing through rental vouchers or ownership; the reform of the $50 billion the government now spends on welfare programs to take the money away from the bureaucracy and give it to individuals; and removing the many bureaucratic barriers to opportunity that now exist for the poor. All of these ideas, of course, flow naturally from the Reaganite values of individual dignity and free choice.    Yet while the Reagan administration has paid lip service to all of them, it has never really taken them to heart. Mr. Reagan never devoted a major TV speech to any civil-rights matter. Earlier this year, when White House aide Gary Bauer invited to Washington Joe Clark, the controversial black principal who is popular for his message of discipline and self-reliance, Deputy Chief of Staff Ken Duberstein tried to limit the publicity and persuade Mr. Bauer to have lunch with Mr. Clark outside of the White House. Even when it did endorse ideas like vouchers for housing or education, the White House often portrayed them as attempts to cut budgets rather than empower minorities or the poor.    Mr. Woodson also recalls when the District of Columbia passed new regulations that put out of business many street vendors, 80% of whom were black. &quot;Where was the administration on this, saying this is an outrage, this is morally repugnant?&quot; he asks. &quot;The only time we hear from them on civil rights is when there's an aggrieved white fireman.&quot;    The political opportunity in all of this would seem obvious, yet only Jack Kemp among the Republican presidential candidates seemed to catch the point. Both George Bush and Bob Dole keep talking about &quot;compassion,&quot; but their specific ideas only mimic liberal proposals for more government programs. Some Democrats may not be so obtuse. Mr. Woodson says he recently was invited to speak before the Democratic Leadership Council. And one White House aide who agrees with Mr. Woodson puts it this way: &quot;What Republicans are doing is leaving the issue to Jesse Jackson.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
