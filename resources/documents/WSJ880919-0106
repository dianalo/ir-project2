The Federal Communications Commission decided Friday to permit ATandamp;T to give a 5% to 10% discount to Holiday Corp., the Memphis, Tenn., company that oversees Holiday Inns, the largest U.S. hotel chain. ATandamp;T told the FCC that Holiday probably would give its business to MCI Communications Corp., which offers lower rates, if ATandamp;T isn't allowed to lower its prices. ATandamp;T generally wants to be able to cut its prices to respond to competitors.    The 2-1 vote will let the discount go into effect while the commission investigates whether it's legal for a regulated company to offer price cuts to one client. Such investigations often take several months, but ATandamp;T could seek permission to grant discounts to other customers on a case-by-case basis while the study is in progress.    ATandamp;T, which had a monopoly on telephone service until the company was broken up in 1984, still is considered dominant in the industry and is subject to rules that don't apply to its competitors, Washington-based MCI and US Sprint Communications Co., Kansas City, Mo., a joint venture between United Telecommunications Inc. and GTE Corp. ATandamp;T's much smaller competitors collectively have only 20% to 30% of the market, according to US Sprint.    Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis voted against the pricing plan but agreed to study it.    Analysts said the FCC's action will allow ATandamp;T to exert greater control over pricing in the industry. Last week, ATandamp;T Chairman Robert Allen told analysts in Boston that the company doesn't want to start a price war. A price war like the ones that periodically break out among airlines would hurt all long-distance companies including ATandamp;T, analysts said.    Robert Morris III of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. said that through the Holiday discount, known as Tariff 15, ATandamp;T is trying to tell competitors that they can no longer win customers just by cutting prices. By being able to match competitors' prices, he said, &quot;ATandamp;T wants to shift the competitive playing field away from price and on to other factors such as customer service and quality of transmission.&quot;    John Hoffman, senior vice president at US Sprint, said he was &quot;frustrated&quot; by the FCC decision and said the company will attempt a legal challenge, though that could be procedurally complicated. &quot;We have got to find a way to get into court,&quot; he said. &quot;We think this is unlawful conduct, and if we get into court, we can prove that.&quot;    A spokeswoman for MCI said, &quot;We're obviously not very pleased&quot; with the tentative ruling. MCI said it is &quot;weighing its options.&quot;    &quot;I think competition is jeopardized&quot; by the FCC action, Mr. Hoffman said. Competitors have said that major price-cutting by ATandamp;T would drive them out of business before it would severely hurt ATandamp;T.    Joseph Nacchio, ATandamp;T's vice president, business services, replied: &quot;US Sprint is a $3 billion company. It has a healthy network and healthy backing, and it says it's doing fine. The competitors in this industry are going to have to learn to challenge us in the marketplace and not in the courthouse. What they say to customers is completely opposite of what they say to regulators.&quot;    Mr. Nacchio said ATandamp;T will decide on a case-by-case basis whether to respond to competitors' price offers to other customers. He said ATandamp;T probably won't inititate price-cutting. &quot;We know if we did that, we would be accused of anti-competitive behavior,&quot; a spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
