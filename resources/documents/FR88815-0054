The data may alsobe examined to validate reported causes of death. If it is determined thatexcess mortality is occurring among individuals exposed to toxic or hazardoussubstances, similarly exposed persons will be notified.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">State or local health departments may provide physician records orprivate physicians themselves may seek consultation with ATSDR. This informationwould be used to evaluate the morbidity or mortality experience of personsexposed to hazardous substances, validate self-reported cases of disease,or to determine numbers of cases of a disease occurrence. Other previouslycollected medical information may also be provided by State or local healthdepartments, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other Federalagencies. This information may have been collected as part of a healthstudy or investigation for which ATSDR is being requested to provide assistance.Approximately 8,000 individuals will probably take part in pilot studieseach year. Of these, 2,000 will be involved in exposure studies, 5,000in symptom and disease prevalence studies, and 1,000 in cluster investigations.There will be approximately 5,000 persons in epidemiologic studies. A portionof individuals involved in pilot studies or epidemiologic studies alongwith other cohorts \3\<NOTE/> identified by other Federal and State investigations willparticipate in ATSDR registries.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ A <T3>cohort</T3> is defined as a group of individuals having a statisticalfactor in common in a demographic study, i.e., exposure to a specific substance,geographic area of residence, etc.At present, the National Exposure Registry is planned with data collectionto begin at two sites (approximately 500 persons per site) in 1988. In1989, six sites and updating of previous sites are planned. The sites likelyto be considered for the establishment of a subregistry include all siteslisted on EPA's National Priorities List (NPL), non-NPL sites on whichepidemiologic/pilot studies may have been conducted, landfills, sites withcontaminated drinking water or soil, and sites of emergency activities.ATSDR, and its contractors, working with State and local health professionals,will identify eligible participants for the subregistry on the basis ofdocumented environmental exposure to the toxicants of interest. Potentiallyexposed persons (current and past) will be identified using tax rolls,city directories, telephone books, school enrollment, rental and employmentrecords, and self-reporting. Individuals with documented exposures willbe contacted and asked to voluntarily participate in the subregistry andto agree to routine releases of data.The records will include, at a minimum, core demographic information (i.e.,name, sex, length of time at current address, current and past occupations,life style factors such as smoking history), the level and length of exposurefor each substance, the pathway of exposure (i.e., air, water, soil, etc.),the route of exposure (i.e., inhalation, ingestion, etc.), and additionalexisting data or medical records that may be available. The specific studyor subregistry will determine the specific types of records collected andmaintained.Pilot studies and registry establishment will involve scientists on thestaff of ATSDR, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and other researchersworking under contracts awarded by ATSDR. These contracts may include:(1) Locating exposed or potentially exposed individuals; (2) conductinginterviews; and (3) collecting blood and urine specimens, or performingmedical examinations. In addition, Registry contracts will entail providingfor annual followup of registrant participants to update information onfile and to possible advise of new scientific information regarding healtheffects, preventive measures, or breakthroughs in treatment of environmentallycaused illnesses unavailable at the time the registry was originally established.CDC staff will participate in collaborative efforts and may perform statisticalanalysis.ATSDR will collect and manage all data in a manner to safeguard any identifyinginformation. Stringent safeguards will be developed to prevent inadvertentdisclosure of any data, as described in the system notice.ATSDR will require that Privacy Act provisions appear in any contractswhich involve the collection of identifying information. Such contractswill specify the appropriate safeguards to be employed in the performanceof the contract, and the disposition of records when the contract is completed.ATSDR has examined a number of alternative means of accomplishing the programrequirements, including the option to maintain no Privacy Act system ofrecords. Considering the potentially large number of individual recordsthat may be involved in carrying out the environmental mandates of ATSDR,it was concluded that it would be impossible to carry out the requiredactivities without collecting individual identifiers. Name and Social Securitynumber (supplied voluntarily) will be some of the indices used to retrieverecords from the system. Other retrieval methods (such as by toxic substance)may be used as individual survey or subregistry dictates.ATSDR is proposing seven routine uses which will support ATSDR's effortsto carry out its legislative mandate efficiently and effectively. Proposedroutine use andplusmin;1 which permits disclosure of information to contractorsto enable them to locate, interview, collect biological samples from orperform medical examinations on individuals will be necessary to gatherinformation about the potential exposure of persons to toxic and hazardoussubstances. This routine use will also be necessary to enable ATSDR toestablish and maintain national registries of persons exposed to toxicsubstances and of persons with diseases associated with such exposures.Proposed routine use andplusmin;2 which permits disclosures of records toother Federal agencies and State or local health officials for collaborativeefforts is intended to enable ATSDR to more effectively conduct its studies,to avoid duplication of study efforts and to facilitate the location ofindividuals for followup surveys and any necessary treatment. This routineuse will also satisfy mandatory reporting requirements when applicable.These disclosures are compatible with the system's purposes to identifythe extent of the health threat posed by exposure to hazardous substances.Proposed routine use andplusmin;3 permitting disclosure of records to otherFederal agencies is intended to aid in locating individuals exposed tohazardous substances. The frequent relocation of families mandates thatall sources of information be utilized to ensure an adequate assessmentof initially exposed individuals who may no longer be residing near thecontaminated site.Proposed routine use andplusmin;4 permits data sharing for research purposes.It is anticipated that data from pilot studies, epidemiologic studies,and establishment of subregistries will be of significant interest to membersof the research community interested in the possible connection betweenhealth problems and exposure to hazardous substances. While ATSDR wishesto share data and avoid duplication of study efforts, the agency is alsocommitted to protecting the integrity of the data collected.Proposed routine use andplusmin;5 permits disclosure to members of Congressfor the purpose of allowing subject individuals to obtain assistance fromtheir representatives in Congress, should they so desire. Such disclosurewill be made only at the explicit request of the individual.Proposed routine use andplusmin;6 permits ATSDR to disclose such recordsas it deems desirable or necessary to the Department of Justice to enablethe Department of Justice to effectively represent the agency. This disclosurewould be necessary in the event of litigation initiated at the requestof EPA in collaboration with ATSDR to recover costs of cleanup operationsassociated with Superfund or Resource Conservation and Recovery Act enforcement.Proposed routine use andplusmin;7 which permits disclosure of records tothe Department of Justice for litigation defense purposes will enable theDepartment of Justice to represent ATSDR in litigation arising from programactivities/operations related to investigations of the health effects ofexposure to hazardous substances.The following notice is written in the present, rather than the futuretense, in order to avoid the unnecessary expenditure of public funds torepublish the notice after the system has become effective.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 9, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Wilford J.

A list of contractor sites whereindividually identified data are currently located is available upon requestto the System Manager.CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM:Individuals exposed or potentially exposed to toxic or hazardous substancesmay include the following: (1) Selected persons living or having livednear a hazardous waste site; (2) Persons exposed or potentially exposedto environmental hazards resulting from ingestion of contaminated drinkingwater, persons exposed to contaminated soil, persons living on mining wastes,persons inhaling toxic substances (all of which may or may not be the resultof contamination by a specified waste site); (3) Participants in pilotstudies (including exposure studies, symptom and disease prevalence studies,cluster investigations), and epidemiologic studies to determine the publichealth threat of exposure to hazardous or toxic substances; (4) Registryparticipants with exposures associated with sites listed on the EnvironmentalProtection Agency's (EPA) National Priorities List (NPL), non-NPL siteson which epidemiologic or pilot studies may have been conducted, sitesof emergency activities, and other toxic waste sites proposed by concernedcitizens; (5) Registry participants with diseases associated or potentiallyassociated with exposure to toxic or hazardous substances; (6) Personsworking or having worked in response actions at hazardous waste sites orother occupational settings where exposure to hazardous substances occurred.The first five categories of persons above may include children as wellas adults.CATEGORIES OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM:Name, address, (including length of time at current address), telephonenumber, date of birth, Social Security number, sex, current and past occupations,dates, pathways and routes of toxic or hazardous substance exposure orpotential exposure, smoking history, results of medical and laboratorytests, records on biological specimens (e.g. blood, urine, etc.), and relateddocuments such as questionnaire responses. The specific type of recordscollected and maintained is determined by the needs of the individual registryor study.AUTHORITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM:``Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Actof 1980'' as amended by ``Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Actof 1986'' (42 U.S.C. 9601, 9604); and the ``Resource Conservation and RecoveryAct of 1976'' as amended in 1984 (42 U.S.C. 6901).PURPOSES:Records in this system are used to carry out the legislated environmentalpublic health mandates of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry(ATSDR). Specifically this information is used to: (1) Identify the publichealth threat caused by exposure to toxic and hazardous substances utilizingpilot studies, epidemiologic studies, and other health effects studies;and (2) establish and maintain national registries of persons exposed totoxic substances and persons with serious diseases and illnesses associatedor potentially associated with exposure to toxic substances. Registrieswill have the additional purposes of tracking exposed individuals, keepingthem informed of health effects of exposure, preventive measures and possiblebreakthroughs in treatment, along with serving as a centralized locationfor research data on these exposed individuals.Records may be disclosed to the Center for Environmental Health and InjuryControl, Centers for Disease Control, for laboratory analysis of samplesand for collaborative efforts (i.e., providing staff, performing statisticalanalysis, etc.) in coordinating investigations. Records (i.e., name, SocialSecurity number, date of birth) may be disclosed to the National Centerfor Health Statistics to obtain a determination of vital status. Deathcertificates with the cause of death will then be obtained from Federal,State, or local agencies to enable ATSDR (1) to determine whether excessmortality is occurring among individuals exposed to toxic or hazardoussubstances, and (2) to notify similarly exposed persons. Records may alsobe disclosed to the Social Security Administration for additional sourcesof locating information.ROUTINE USES OF RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING CATEGORIESOF USERS AND THE PURPOSES OF SUCH USES:1. Records may be disclosed to Department of Health and Human Servicescontractors to locate individuals exposed or potentially exposed to toxicor hazardous substances (e.g., in the establishment of the National ExposureRegistry), conduct interviews, perform medical examinations, collect andanalyze biological specimens, evaluate and interpret data, and performfollowup health investigations so that the research purposes for whichthe records are collected may be accomplished. The contractor must complywith the requirements of the Privacy Act with respect to such records.2. Records may be disclosed to Federal agencies such as the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA), State and local health departments, and otherpublic health or cooperating medical authorities in connection with programactivities and related collaborative efforts to deal more effectively withexposures to hazardous or toxic substances, and to satisfy mandatory reportingrequirements when applicable.3. Records (i.e., name, Social Security number) may be disclosed to otherFederal agencies and to missing person location agencies to obtain informationto aid in locating individuals involved in these studies.4. Records may be disclosed for a research purpose, when the Department:(A) Has determined that the use or disclosure does not violate legal orpolicy limitations under which the record was provided, collected, or obtained;(B) has determined that the research purpose (1) cannot be reasonably accomplishedunless the record is provided in individually identified form, and (2)warrants the risk to the privacy of the individual that additional exposureof the record might bring; (C) has required the recipient to (1) establishreasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to preventunauthorized use or disclosure of the record, (2) remove or destroy theinformation that identifies the individual at the earliest time at whichremoval or destruction can be accomplished consistent with the purposeof the research project, unless the recipient has presented adequate justificationof a research or health nature for retaining such information, and (3)make no further use or disclosure of the record except (a) in emergencycircumstances affecting the health or safety of any individual, (b) foruse in another research project, under these same conditions, and withwritten authorization of the Department, (c) for disclosure to a properlyidentified person for the purpose of an audit related to the research project,if information that would enable research subjects to be identified isremoved or destroyed at the earliest opportunity consistent with the purposeof the audit, or (d) when required by law; (D) has secured a written statementattesting to the recipient's understanding of, and willingness to abideby these provisions.5. Disclosures may be made to a congressional office from the records ofan individual, in response to a verified inquiry from the congressionaloffice made at the written request of that individual.6. In the event of litigation initiated by EPA in collaboration with ATSDR,ATSDR may disclose such records as it deems desirable or necessary to theDepartment of Justice to enable the Department to effectively representATSDR. The types of litigative proceedings that ATSDR may request includethe recovery of expenses incurred in cleanup operations at Superfund orResource Conservation and Recovery Act sites, including program and staffcosts.7. In the event of litigation where the defendant is (a) the Department,any component of the Department, or any employee of the Department in hisor her official capacity; (b) the United States where the Department determinesthat the claim, if successful, is likely to directly affect the operationsof the Department or any of its components; or (c) any Department employeein his or her individual capacity where the Justice Department has agreedto represent such employee, for example, in defending a claim against thePublic Health Service based upon an individual's mental or physical conditionand alleged to have arisen because of activities of the Public Health Servicein connection with such individual, disclosure may be made to the Departmentof Justice to enable that Department to present an effective defense, providedthat such disclosure is compatible with the purpose for which the recordswere collected.policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, anddisposing of records in the system:storage:File folders, computer tapes and disks (hard and floppy).retrievability:By name or Social Security number.safeguards:The following special safeguards are provided to protect the records frominadvertent disclosure:1. Authorized Users: Access is granted to only a limited number of physicians,scientists, statisticians, and designated support staff of ATSDR or itscontractors, as authorized by the system manager to accomplish the statedpurposes for which the data in this system have been collected. A listof authorized users will be maintained by the system manager.2. Physical Safeguards. Questionnaires, log books, and other source dataare maintained in locked cabinets in locked rooms, 24-hour guard servicein buildings, personnel screening of visitors, electronic anti-intrusiondevices in operation at the Federal Records Center (FRC), fire extinguishers,overhead sprinkler system, and card-access control equipment in the mainframecomputer room (Clifton Road facility), computer terminals, lockable personalcomputers, and automated records located in secured areas.3. Procedural Safeguards: Protection for computerized records includesprogrammed verification of valid user identification code, account codeand password prior to acceptance of a terminal session or job submission,computer software to control access, frequently changed passwords, andFault Management System.Knowledge of individual tape passwords is required to access tapes, andacces to systems is limited to users obtaining prior supervisory approval.When Privacy Act tapes are scratched, a special ``certified'' process isperformed in which tapes are completely written over to avoid inadvertentdata disclosure. When possible, a backup copy of data is stored at an offsitelocation and a log kept of all changes to each file and all persons reviewingthe file. Selected safeguards will be applicable to specific elements ofthe system, as appropriate. Additional safeguards may also be built intothe program by the system analyst as warranted by the sensitivity of thespecific data set.ATSDR and contractor employees who maintain records are instructed in specificprocedures to protect the security of records, and are to check with thesystem manager prior to making disclosures of data. When individually identifieddata are being used in a room, admittance at either ATSDR or contractorsites is restricted to specifically authorized personnel.Appropriate Privacy Act provisions are included in contracts and the ATSDRProject Director, contract officers, and project officers oversee compliancewith these requirements. Upon completion of the contract, all data willbe either returned to ATSDR or destroyed, as specified by the contract.4. Implementation Guidelines: The safeguards outlined above are developedin accordance with Chapter 45-13, ``Safeguarding Records Contained in Systemsof Records,'' of the HHS General Administration Manual, supplementary ChapterPHS.hf: 45-13; Part 66, ``Automated Information Systems Security,'' ofthe HHS Information Resources Management Manual; the National Bureau ofStandards Federal information Processing Standards (FIPS Pub. 41 and FIPSPub. 31). FRC safeguards are in compliance with GSA Federal Property ManagementRegulations, Subchapter B-Archives and Records.retention and disposal:ATSDR retains records in accordance with the CDC Records Control ScheduleItem 37, which allows the system manager to keep the records for 20 yearsunless needed for further study. Registry records will be actively maintainedas long as funding is provided for by legislation. Contractors will retainthe records only as long as necessary to complete data collection and verifyATSDR's receipt of the data in usable form. Record copy of study reportsis maintained in the agency from two to three years in accordance withretention schedules. Source documents for computer tapes or disks are disposedof when no longer needed in the study as determined by the system manager,and as provided in the signed consent form, as appropriate.Records may be transferred to a Federal Records Center for storage whenno longer needed for evaluation or analysis. Disposal methods include thepaper recycling process, burning or shredding hard copy records, and erasingcomputer tapes and disks.system manager and address:Director, Office of Health Assessment, Agency for Toxic Substances andDisease Registry, Chamblee Building 28N, 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA30333;Director, Office of External Affairs, Agency for Toxic Substances and DiseaseRegistry, Chamblee Building 28S, 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA 30333;Policy coordination is provided by: Deputy Associate Administrator, Agencyfor Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Chamblee Building 29, 1600 CliftonRoad, Atlanta, GA 30333.notification procedures:An individual may learn if a record exists about himself/herself by contactingthe appropriate system manager at the address above. Persons who knowinglyand willfully request or acquire a record pertaining to an individual underfalse pretenses are subject to criminal prosecution.
