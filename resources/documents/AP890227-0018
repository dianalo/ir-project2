The government's latest devaluation of the national currencymeant only one thing: higher prices for food and transport; highercosts for doing business; yet another round of belt-tightening.   ``If we ate meat three times a week, now we'll eat it once a weekand so on until we become vegetarians,'' the woman said, toying witha pencil at her desk. ``But even vegetables are expensive _ when youcan find them.''   The woman and her husband are urban professionals in their early30s with a small business. They are expecting their third child.   In private conversations, the two spoke of the hardships themiddle class is enduring as a result of Nicaragua's economic crisisand the thought that crosses so many people's minds: pack up andleave for the United States, where many have relatives and friends.   The devaluation of the cordoba is part of the government'sefforts to halt hyperinflation.   ``You keep cutting back and cutting back (on the householdbudget), but now I'm wondering what else I can eliminate,'' thewoman added.   ``And if that's us and people like us,'' she said, leaningforward to emphasize her point, ``can you imagine what poor peopleare going through?''   Poor and middle-class people are leaving the country in droves,undeterred even by a get-tough U.S. immigration policy that tookeffect last Tuesday.   Despite a tripling of the price for a new passport, Nicaraguansstill flock to immigration offices.   A senior Western diplomat said figures compiled from varioussources indicate that from 1979 _ when the leftist Sandinistas cameto power _ through 1987, Nicaragua lost about 8,500 professionals.   The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said about2,000 professional and business people left the country in 1988alone _ despite the signing of a preliminary peace accord in Marchafter seven years of war with the Contra rebels. Nicaragua'spopulation is about 3 million.   ``That's people in education, business, engineering, medicine,''the diplomat said. ``We're not talking about ideology; these arepeople seeking better horizons.''   With Thursday's latest currency devaluation, the official rate ofexchange became 3,800 cordobas per dollar, up from 3,200.   At the new rate, a typical monthly salary of 200,000 cordobas isworth $52. Many professionals earn up to 500,000 cordobas a month,which translates to only $131. A new passport costs 150,000 cordobas.   With the lastest devaluation, the price of a gallon of gasolinerose to $2.07, up from $1.76 a gallon. Higher fuel costs mean higherprices for food, which is trucked into the city from the countryside.   ``She's been pressuring me for us to get out of here and go toMiami,'' the woman's husband confided when his wife was out ofearshot. ``But I can't abandon my business now and lose all I've putinto it.''   He said that even if he wanted to sell, he'd be hard pressed tofind a buyer.   To control runaway inflation that reached 20,000 in 1988 and 97percent in January alone, the government is firing more than 30,000workers, slashing public spending, and tightly restricting credit.   President Daniel Ortega has summed up his government's attitudetoward the exodus by saying that whoever doesn't like it here can``leave for Miami to look for democracy and ways to enrichthemselves.''   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has summed up itsnew policy, aimed at Central Americans who usually come in illegallythrough Texas, by saying that anyone who can't prove politicalpersecution will be denied asylum and immediately jailed anddeported.   That policy led to only a small decrease last week in the numberof people wanting to leave, said Sergio Domingo Prado, who owns atravel agency specializing in trips to Guatemala, Mexico and theUnited States.   He said he used to organize trips to Guatemala buy bus butstopped because every increase in fuel costs increased the price ofhis bus tickets.   ``People didn't understand. Now I just deal in plane tickets.They're more stable,'' he said.   His customers often make their way from Mexico and Guatemala intothe United States.   On a recent evening, people began assembling on a sidewalk in alower-class neighborhood of Managua to wait for a bus to Guatemala.   Sitting on the curb in front of a travel agency were small knotsof travelers and their relatives. Some were silent; others cried.   Lourdes Maria Rayo Vargas, 23, was leaving with her 15-year-oldsister and their mother. They were the last in the family to leave.Their father and three brothers had left for Guatemala four monthsago.   ``I was the only one in the family working,'' said Ms. Rayo. ``Iworked in a supermarket, then I sold shoes. Now I've been out ofwork for seven months.''   She said she gave up trying to find a job.</TEXT></DOC>
