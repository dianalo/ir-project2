The order by Justice Byron White came about seven hours beforeWalter Bell, 34, was to be put to death by injection shortly aftermidnight Thursday.   Asked to describe Bell's reaction, attorney Eden Harringtonreplied, ``I wouldn't say `happy' is the word. Obviously, he'snervous.''   Defense attorneys turned to the high court after the 5th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans refused earlier Thursday tohalt Bell's execution.   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and a federal district judgeturned down a request for a reprieve earlier this week.   Ms. Harrington, a University of Texas Law School CapitalPunishment Clinic attorney who is helping represent Bell, contendedhe should not be executed because he is mentally retarded.   State attorneys disagreed, insisting the arguments should havebeen raised earlier.   The Supreme Court already has agreed to review another Texasdeath-penalty case that challenges the constitutionality ofexecuting mentally retarded people.   Bell ranks third in seniority on Texas' 283-inmate death row,where he has lived for more than 14 years since his conviction inthe deaths of Ferd and Irene Chisum, both 59, during a robbery attheir home.   At the time of his arrest in 1974, Bell _ one of 13 children inhis family _ said he could neither read nor write and never had anyschooling except for some special education classes in his homestate of Louisiana.   Chisum owned an appliance store and had fired Bell as anemployee.   The bodies of Chisum and his wife were found in their bathtub.Chisum had been stabbed and his wife strangled and raped.   Bell was arrested after he tried to cash a check from theChisums' bank account. Trial testimony showed Mrs. Chisum wasstrangled with a towel after being forced to write several checks.   Bell, who had been training as a heavyweight boxer and wasarrested 10 days before his first scheduled pro fight, hasmaintained his innocence. He has said he rejected a plea bargainthat would have resulted in a 15-year prison term.   Texas leads the nation with 27 executions since the SupremeCourt allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976.</TEXT></DOC>
