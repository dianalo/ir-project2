The software industry would welcome any progress: Slowdevelopment of software is often cited as holding back salesof both software and hardware in the computer industry.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, there is a bewildering array of softwareand hardware &quot;environments&quot; competing for the affections ofcompanies that develop software applications. Thus, somecompanies may see the IBM-Metaphor venture as simplyconfusing issues further by adding yet another softwareenvironment. In any case, the venture's software won't beavailable for a couple of years.   &quot;I think the venture is interesting. I think it's worthwatching. I think Metaphor has very good softwareinterfaces,&quot; said Michele Preston, a securities analyst atCowen andamp; Co. &quot;But it's going to take some time, and as we allknow the number of changes that can take place in the(software) world in two years is enormous.&quot;   The two companies will take advantage of some advances ina fairly new type of programming, called object-orientedprogramming. Among other things, object-oriented work letsprogrammers re-use sections of code that others have alreadywritten and makes it easier for programmers to updateexisting software. Steven P. Jobs's Next Inc. workstations,for example, run software developed in an object-orientedenvironment, and software developers have described thatenvironment as the most innovative and welcome feature of themachines.   The software will be designed for use with either the OS/2or Unix operating system -- a layer of software that controlsthe basic operations of a computer. The software won't meanthat someone using an OS/2-based application on a PC coulduse it on a workstation using a Unix application. But itshould make it easier for a programmer to translate softwarefrom one operating system to the other.   David Liddle, chairman of closely held Metaphor, MountainView, Calif., said that as many as 200 programmers will beinvolved in the effort. He said IBM will sell the software onits own machines, while Metaphor will have the right to sellthe software to other hardware makers.</TEXT></DOC>
