Freedman, the 59-year-old vicechairman of Coopers andamp; Lybrand's northeast region business,was elected to a three-year term as chairman of the fifthbiggest U.S. accounting company.   Mr. Freedman's selection comes at a crucial time forCoopers, which, unlike other major accounting firms, hasn'ttried the merger route to achieve growth. Rather, Coopers hasgrown by keeping costs down, slowly gaining market share andbenefiting when disgruntled offices of other merged firmsleave to join Coopers.</LP><TEXT>   After the merger last year of Deloitte, Haskins andamp; Sellsand Touche Ross andamp; Co. into Deloitte andamp; Touche, now the thirdbiggest U.S. accounting firm, the London office of Deloittedefected to Coopers, giving Coopers a lot more competitivemuscle in Europe in preparation for the unified Common Marketnext year.   &quot;Coopers practices accounting the old-fashioned way -- nofrills and hard work,&quot; says Arthur Bowman, publisher ofBowman's Accounting Report. &quot;It will need a new image andmore focus on market growth in these rough economic times.&quot;   Mr. Freedman, who will succeed Peter R. Scanlon, 60, asCoopers's chairman on Oct. 1, said that while retainingmanagement policies that have resulted in double-digitrevenue growth during Mr. Scanlon's nine-year term, he plansto lay more stress on global business strategies. He iscurrently deputy chairman for international and professionaldevelopment.   Mr. Freedman said that clients' needs are changing morerapidly than ever for new types of accounting, auditing, taxand consulting services. &quot;It will necessitate changes in theway we do business,&quot; he said. He didn't specify the changes.Because Coopers's retirement age for partners is 62, Mr.Freedman is a one-term chairman, which some Coopers'spartners feel will enable him to make changes withoutworrying whether he will be elected to a second term.   Coopers's 1990 annual U.S. revenue rose 12% from theprevious year to $1.4 billion -- the best year-to-year gainamong the six biggest accounting firms except for ArthurAndersen andamp; Co., which had a 14.4% gain last year. Andconsulting -- the most lucrative of accounting firms'practices -- contributed 25% of Coopers' annual revenue --again the largest share for the firms except for Andersen,where the share was 44%.   Mr. Scanlon has run a tight ship, keeping much control atthe top, say partners. They describe Mr. Freedman as a strongadministrator, too, but with a different style. Coopers'sBoston office, which Mr. Freedman heads, is among thestrongest business performers at Coopers, the partners say.   Mr. Freedman &quot;may seem to drive his staff too hard. He'snot adverse to phoning you at very early and late hours athome if he has a business question. But he's very willing tolisten to your point of view,&quot; says one partner, who requestsanonymity.   Having recently begun to play golf at a very late age, Mr.Freedman recently became very excited after parring adifficult hole and told other Coopers's partners about it.&quot;He's very intense and his real hobby is his job,&quot; says onepartner.</TEXT></DOC>
