The fiscal 1989 spending blueprint, passed 69-26, also includesincreases for education, the space program and AIDS research whilefreezing or cutting back transportation, housing and developmentgrants to local governments.   ``We made tough choices,'' said Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla.,chairman of the Budget Committee. He defended his plan whileconceding that the deficit problem remains unsolved. ``We can'tkeep consuming more than we earn and living on credit,'' he said.   Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., called the budget a ``lostopportunity'' that resulted from ``a decision to coast rather thandeal with the deficit'' in an election year.   ``The next president and the next Congress will be left withenormous problems,'' he said.   The House approved a different version of the spending plan lastmonth. The two chambers will begin negotiations next week toward afinal budget resolution.   Conforming with last fall's deficit-reduction agreement with thepresident, the Senate plan earmarks $294 billion for militaryspending and $16.1 billion for international assistance. Itincludes no new taxes beyond the $14 billion enacted last Decemberfor fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.   The agreement also capped spending by domestic agencies. TheHouse plan, like Reagan's proposed budget, conformed with thoselimits.   But the Senate voted 93-0 Wednesday night to bypass the spendingcaps to provide an additional $2.6 billion for anti-drug effortsbeginning next year. The money would go for treatment programs, lawenforcement and interdiction of smuggled drugs.   The amendment offered by Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., andAlfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., called for increasing government tax anddebt collections to cover the $1.4 billion portion of this newmoney that would be spent during the 1989 fiscal year.   Sponsors said they weren't busting the deficit agreement,because that pact includes a clause allowing exceptions for direemergencies.   The Senate budget claims to reduce the deficit to $136 billion,as required by the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. Like theHouse, the Senate adopted the administration's optimistic economicscenarios in order to show less red ink.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the deficit would be$35 billion higher. The deficit was $150 billion in fiscal 1987,and it is expected to dip to $147.5 billion this year.   Overall, the Senate budget would cut the deficit $7.2 billionbelow what would otherwise be expected under current law, accordingto budget committee figures. Less than half of those savings wouldcome from spending cuts, with the bulk relying mostly on sales ofgovernment assets to show a deficit reduction.   The DeConcini-D'Amato drug amendment and a smaller one, alsoshifting more money to drugs, were the only two substantiveamendments adopted by the Senate in four days of debate.   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 57-38, a proposal by Sen.Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., to postpone starting construction of thesuperconducting super collider research project until after nextyear, and using the $50 million saved for health care.   Senators also defeated, 66-29, an amendment by Sen. BillArmstrong, R-Colo., to cut development programs to pay for areduction in the capital gains tax.   Like Reagan's budget, the Senate plan greatly increases spaceand science spending. The space program would get a 27 percentincrease and the National Science Foundation 11 percent more thanduring the current fiscal year.   AIDS research would get more than $1.3 billion.   ``This is one of the most futuristic budgets in the history ofthe United States,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, thesenior Republican on the budget committee.   The Senate plan also boosts aviation safety programs by 19percent, to allow for hiring of more air traffic controllers andpurchase of new equipment.   The House approved a more modest boost in the space program,opting instead to protect housing, development and transportationprograms from cutbacks.   Neither plan contemplates major changes in agriculture programs.The Senate version includes $500 million for buying commodities tocontinue the distributions to the needy.   The Senate budget adopts Reagan's proposal to increase militarypay by 4.3 percent but civilian federal salaries by only 2 percent.The House opted for a 3 percent pay hike for all federal employees.   The Senate budget action came on the earliest date in years, butCongress was still missing its April 15 deadline for finishingbudget action.   The budget is a congressional resolution that does not requirethe president's signature. It serves as a guideline for Congress asit produces its annual spending bills.</TEXT></DOC>
