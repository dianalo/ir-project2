About $980 million of Gulf Canada securities are affectedby the downgrade, the ratings concern said.</LP><TEXT>   Moody's said it expects that the poor outlook for Gulf'scontract drilling operation, declining domestic oilproduction and weak natural gas prices will hurt thecompany's performance.   The rating of Gulf's senior debentures was lowered toBaa-3 from Baa-1, and its shelf registration was downgradedto prospective Baa-3 from prospective Baa-1. Moody's saidGulf's Series 1 preference shares were downgraded to Ba-1from Baa-2, while commercial paper rating dropped to prime-3from prime-2.   But Moody's added that it expects Gulf to improve itsleverage and generate more cash flow to cover its interestpayments in the wake of recent management plans to sellassets, cut costs and redeem half of the Series 1 preferenceshares.   &quot;Redemption of the preference shares will give a modestboost to Gulf Canada's after-tax cash flow,&quot; Moody's said.   The ratings concern said Gulf Canada's prospects aredependent on the stability of prices for oil and natural gas.   Gulf officials couldn't be reached for comment. Gulf is aCalgary-based oil and gas production concern.   In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, GulfCanada shares closed at $7.875, up 12.5 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
