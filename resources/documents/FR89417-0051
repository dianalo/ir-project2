Critical habitat is not proposed. Thisfreshwater mussel has declined precipitously over the last one hundredyears. Once found in approximately 70 locations in 15 major Atlantic slopedrainages from New Brunswick to North Carolina, it is now known from onlyten localities. The extant populations occur in the Ashuelot River in CheshireCounty, New Hampshire; two reaches of the Connecticut River in SullivanCounty, New Hampshire, and Windsor County, Vermont; McIntosh Run in St.Mary's County, Maryland; two tributaries of Tuckahoe Creek in Talbot, QueenAnne's and Caroline Counties, Maryland; Little River in Johnston County,North Carolina; the Tar River in Granville County, North Carolina; andtwo Tar River tributaries in Franklin County, North Carolina. All extantpopulations are small, and probably decling due to continued environmenaldegradation. Threats include siltation, pollution, agricultural and urbanrunoff, channelization, land development, and road and dam construction.This proposal, if made final, would implement Federal protection providedby the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. The Service is requestingdata and comments from the public on this proposal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments from all interested parties must be received byJune 16, 1989.

Andrew Moser at the aboveaddress (301/269-5448).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The dwarf wedge mussel was first described by Lea (1892) as <T3>Unio heterodon</T3>; it was subsequently placed in the genus <T3>Alasmidonta. </T3>The species name <T3>heterodon </T3>refers to the chief distinguishing characteristic ofthis species, which is the only North American freshwater mussel that consistentlyhas two lateral teeth on the right valve, but only one on the left (Fuller1977). It is a small mussel whose shell rarely exceeds 1.5 inches in length.The species exhibits strong sexual dimorphism with females showing posteriorinflation of the shell to accommodate the marsupial gills. The dwarf wedge mussel lives on muddy sand, sand, and gravel bottoms increeks and rivers of varying sizes, in areas of slow to moderate currentand little silt deposition. The most commonly associated freshwater musselsare <T3>Elliptio complanata </T3>and <T3>Alasmidonta undulata. </T3>Other co-occurring mussels include <T3>Strophitus undulatus, Anodonta cataracta, Elliptio lanceolata, Elliptiofisheriana, Lampsilis radiata, Margaritifera margaritifera. </T3>In the species as a whole, the gravid (egg-laden) females are found fromlate August to June (Clarke 1981). The host fish, to which the larval musselsattach, has not been determined. <T3>A. heterodon </T3>recently disappeared from New Brunswick waters stillsupporting a diversity of other mussels, including sensitive species suchas <T3>Alasmidonta varicosa, </T3>following construction of a causeway blockingthe passage of anadromous fishes. This fact, coupled with the coastal distributionof <T3>A. heterodon, </T3>suggests that the host fish may be an anadromousor catadromous species (Master 1986). The dwarf wedge mussel was once widely distributed in river systems ofthe Atlantic slope from New Brunswick, Canada, south to the Neuse Riversystem in North Carolina. It was recorded from 70 localities in 15 drainagesin 11 states and one Canadian province (Master 1986). River systems historicallyinhabited by this species included: the Petitcodiac River system in NewBrunswick; the Taunton River, Agawam River, Merrimac River, ConnecticutRiver and Quinnipiac River system in New England; the Hackensack River,Delaware River, and Susquehanna River systems in the Middle Atlantic states;the Choptank River, Rappahannock River, James River, Tar River and NeuseRiver systems in the southeast. Based on the Nature Conservancy's recemt rangewide status survey (Master1986) and other survey data, <T3>A. heterodon </T3>is now thought to be extirpated from all but tensmall sites in five drainages in four states. The extant populations occurin the Ashuelot River in Cheshire County, New Hampshire; two reaches ofthe Connecticut River in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, and Windsor County,Vermont; McIntosh Run in St. Mary's County, Maryland; two tributaries ofTuckahoe Creek in Talbot, Queen Anne's and Caroline Counties, Maryland;Little River in Johnston County, North Carolina; the Tar River in GranvilleCounty, North Carolina; and two Tar River tributaries in Franklin County,North Carolina. One population of this mussel occuring in the Fort Riverin Hampshire County, Massachusetts, considered extant by Master (1986),now appears to be extipated. Despite a considerable amount of unionid (freshwater mussel) field workin recent years throughout the range of this species, the few new populationsdiscovered were mostly near previously known populations, attesting bothto the coverage of historical field work and to the widespread declineof this species. There may be as few as four viable populations (AshuelotRiver, Connecticut River, Tar River and Tuckahoe Creek drainages), eachof which occupies a very limited area where they face an uncertain futuredue to threats of development, pollution, dam and bridge construction,etc. (Master 1986). In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 22, 1984 (49 FR 21675) the dwarf wedgemussel was included in category 2 of the Service's Review of InvertebrateWildlife. Category 2 comprises those taxa for which proposed listing ispossibly appropriate but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerabilityare not available to support a proposed rule. Completion of the NatureConservancy's status survey provided much of the data needed to supporta listing proposal. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq</T3>.) and regulations promulgated to implement the listingprovisions of the Act (codified at 50 CFR Part 424) set forth the proceduresfor adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined tobe an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factorsdescribed in Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to thedwarf wedge mussel (<T3>Alasmidonta heterodon</T3>) are as follows: A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range.</T3> Habitat modification has been an importantfactor in the dramatic reduction in the distribution of this mussel. Thedamming and channelization of rivers throughout the species' range hasresulted in the elimination of much formerly occupied habitat. For example,dams have converted much of the Connecticut River mainstream into a seriesof impoundments. Immediately upstream from each dam, conditions, includingheavy silt deposition and low oxygen levels, are inimical to mussel speciessuch as the dwarf wedge mussel. Immediately downstream from these dams,daily water level and water temperature fluctuations as a result of intermittentpower generation and hypolimnetic discharges are also stressful to mussels.In some areas below dams the river banks have been stabilized and the substrateis no longer suitable for any bivalve species. Dams may also cause a more subtle influence on this species. The PetitcodiacRiver in New Brunswick still provides a suitable habitat for other rare,declining, and apparently sensitive mussels such as the brook floater (<T3>Alasmidonta varicosa</T3>). but the dwarf wedge mussel is ow absent.In the intervening years since the dwarf wedge mussel was collected inthis drainage, a downstream casuseway has acted as a dam, blocking accessto the dwarf wedge mussel habitat by anadromous fishes. Although the fishhost(s) of the dwarf wedge mussel is unknown, the mussel's absence fromthe Petitcodiac suggests the possible loss of an anadromous or catadromousfish host. A dam proposal currently threatens one of the ten known remainingpopulations (at Summar Falls, New Hampshire). The disappearance of the dwarf wedge mussel from most of its historic sitescan best be explained by agricultural, domestic, and industrial pollutionof its aquatic habitat. Mussels are known to be sensitive to potassium(a common pollutant associated with paper mills and irrigation return water),zinc, copper, cadmium, and other elements (Havlik and Marking 1987). Pesticides,chlorine, excessive nutrients, and silt carried by agricultural runoffalso present a threat to this species. No mussels survive in several large, undammed sections of the Connecticutand Delaware River drainages where water pollution has exerted to heavytoll on the benthic fauna. Even where water quality has improved, as inthe lower Connecticut River, chemicals trapped in the sediments inhabitedby mussels may impede the recovery of sensitive species (Master 1986).One of the largest known remaining populations of the dwarf wedge musseloccurs where the Ashuelot River meanders through a golf course. The continuingdecline of the dwarf wedge mussel at this site, particularly downstreamof the golf course, may well be attributed to fungicides, herbicides, insecticides,and fertilizers applied to the golf course and to agricultural runoff fromabutting corn fields and pastures (Master 1986). Current plans to expandthe golf course would increase the portion of the mussel population thatthe golf course affects and thereby accelerate the population's decline.Pollutants may also affect the mussels indirectly; nitrogen and phosphorusinput cause organic enrichment and, if extreme, oxygen depletion. Acidrain may mobilize toxic metals and lead to decreased alkalinity which isinimical to most mussels. Increased acidity appears to have contributedto the recent decline of the dwarf wedge mussel in the Fort River in Massachusetts(D. Smith, Univ. of Massachusetts Museum of Zoology, pers. comm.). Erosion and siltation resulting from land clearing and grading and constructionof bridges, roads, and other structures may be especially damaging to thedwarf wedge mussel's habitat. For instance, in Massachusetts, a dwarf wedgemussel population was decimated in one small stream when ``the constructionof a small bridge resulted in accelerated sedimentation erosion which buriedand killed many of the bivalves'' (Smith 1981). Paradoxically, some bank erosion control measures such as riprapping mayalso adversely affect the species. A significant portion of one of theextant Connecticut River populations was eliminated in 1987 by burial underrock riprap placed along the shore of a Vermont state part (F. Brackley,Vermont Natural Heritage Program, pers. comm.). B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes.</T3> Although collection was probably an insignificant factorin the species' decline, it is a serious threat to the few remaining populations.These populations are vulnerable because of their small size and becausethe entire population may occur in a few hundred yards of stream length.Furthermore, because of its rarity and unusual shell anatomy, the speciesis sought by collectors. C. <T3>Disease or predation.</T3> Although the dwarf wedge mussel is presumablyutilized for food by mammals such as, mink, muskrat, and raccoon, predationis not though to be a significant factor in the decline of this species.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3>The dwarf wedgemussel is listed as a State endangered species in Maryland, Massachusetts,New Hampshire, and Vermont; no protection is afforded the species in NorthCarolina. Although State listings provide limited protection against taking,in most of these States it provides little or no protection of habitat.It will not be adequate to prevent the species' further decline. E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>The dwarf wedge mussel is threatened by its limited distribution andlow numbers. Most of the sites where this species occurs are isolated fromeach other. This creates isolated gene pools that are vulnerable to lossof genetic variability. Furthermore, because this species, like all freshwatermussels, depends on water currents to transport gametes from one individualto another, its reduced numbers and population densities decrease the likelihoodof successful reproduction. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the dwarf wedge mussel as an endangeredspecies. This species has been extirpated from most of the localities fromwhich it was known historically. The small size and very limited geographicextent of each of this mussel's remaining populations makes them extremelyvulnerable to extirpation. Any of these small populations could be eliminatedby a single catastrophic event such as a chemical spill; several face imminentthreats from dam construction, bridge construction, or channelization.Threatened status would therefore not be appropriate. Critical habitatis not proposed for the reasons given in the following section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at thetime a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Servicefinds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent for the dwarfwedge mussel at this time. This rare and unusual mussel is sought afterby amateur and scientific collectors. Its occurrence in small, localizedpopulations makes this species particularly vulnerable to overcollecting.Because of this, the Service believes a detailed description of the species'habitat, required as part of any critical habitat designation, could increasethe species' vulnerability to illegal taking and increase law enforcementproblems. Therefore, it would not be prudent to designate critical habitatfor this species. Doing so would draw attention to the dwarf wedge musseland risk depletion of its already limited populations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and local governments and private agencies, groups,and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provide for possible land acquisitionand cooperation with the States and requires that recovery actions be carriedout for all listed species. Such actions are initiated by the Service followinglisting. Some actions may be initiated prior to listing, circumstancespermitting. Recovery actions that may be beneficial to the dwarf wedgemussel include: (1) Determination of the host fish(es); (2) Determination of the species' sensitivities to various pollutants andwater quality factors; (3) Controlling pollution and runoff from adjacent and upstream areas ofthe watersheds inhabited by the mussel; (4) Establishing conservation easements along selected river and streamcorridors; (5) Transplants of the species to unoccupied historical sites having appropriatesubstrate and water quality conditions. The protection required of Federalagencies and the prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, inpart, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect alisted species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agencymust enter into formal consultation with the Service. Federal activities that could impact the dwarf wedge mussel in the futureinclude, but are not limited to the following: road bridge and dam construction;stream channelization; permits for effluent discharges and stream alterations;licensing of hydroelectric facilities; and registration of pesticides.One specific project having Federal involvement which could impact thespecies has been identified. This project involves the construction ofa new bridge crossing for Maryland Route 404 over a tributary of TuckahoeCreek in Maryland. The Service has begun coordination with the MarylandState Highway Administration regarding methods to minimize impact of thisproposed project on the dwarf wedge mussel. The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth aseries of general prohibitions and exception that apply to all endangeredwildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take, import or export, shipin interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell oroffer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any endangered fish orwildlife species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry,transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certainexceptions would apply to agents of the Service and State conservationagencies. Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for scientificpurposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/orfor incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning: (1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to this species; (2) The location of any additional populations of this species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by Section 4 of the Act; (3) Additional information concerning the rage and distribution of thisspecies; (4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on this species. The final decision on this proposed rule will take into consideration thecomments and any additional information received by the Service, and suchcommunications may lead to adoption of a final regulation that differsfrom this proposal. The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of publicationof the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing (see <T2>addresses </T2>section).<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.
