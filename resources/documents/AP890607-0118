(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lawyers for the Bible Speaks Churchcited principles of religious freedom in asking the U.S. SupremeCourt to overturn a multimillion-dollar award to an heiress whoclaimed she was duped into donating money to the fundamentalist sect.   The church contended in its request for review, filed Monday,that the issues raised by the case posed a threat to all religiouscommunities, especially those whose ``non-mainstream characterrenders them particularly vulnerable to bias and misunderstanding,both conscious and unconscious.''   ``You can't unscramble so-called `possible secular components'(for making a donation) from a combination of reasons, most of whichare religous, without offending the Constitution,'' said Norman RoyGrutman, a church attorney.   Elizabeth Dovydenas of Lenox maintained the Lenox-based church'sleader, Carl H. Stevens, conned her into donating $6.6 million tothe church in 1984 and 1985. She left the church in 1985.   A federal appeals court found in March that her first donationshad been freely given and should not be returned. But it upheldlower court rulings ordering the return of $5.5 million insubsequent gifts.   ``Those who run (the church) may freely exercise their religion,but they cannot use the cloak of religion to exert undue influenceof a non-religious nature with impunity,'' Justice Hugh Bownes wrotein the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals decision.   The case was first heard in U.S. Bankruptcy Court after thechurch petitioned for Chapter 11 protection, maintaining that Mrs.Dovydenas' claim could force it into insolvency. After a judge ruledin her behalf and a trustee was appointed to oversee the church'sheadquarters, church leaders and dozens of followers abruptly movedout of the former prep school in Lenox. Many have since settled inthe Baltimore area.   The property eventually was sold to Mrs. Dovydenas for $3.5million at a bankruptcy auction. She has told town officials thatshe plans to turn part of it into a community center.</TEXT></DOC>
