It is political power at its rawest --and a timely moneymaking opportunity for some computersavvyentrepreneurs.   Virtually every congressional and legislative district inthe U.S. -- as well as some city and county council districts-- is being altered in the next 18 months. Making thiscomplex process, known as redistricting, come out the waypoliticians want it to is a nightmare. But thanks to thecomputer software and consulting expertise of a number ofmostly small companies, the chore of carving new electoraldistricts is more manageable in 1991 than in years past.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We've spent the last four or five years gearing up for1991,&quot; says Kimball Brace, president of Election DataServices Inc., Washington, D.C. His company is helping Iowa,Illinois, Colorado and seven other states plus New York Cityrealign their congressional and legislative district lines toconform to population shifts that occurred during the 1980s.   Mr. Brace's task is sensitive. He accepts both Republicanand Democratic clients, pledging in each case to help craftdistricts that will tilt the power balance toward the clientpaying his fee. In Illinois, his company is working directlyfor the House speaker and Senate president, both Democrats.In Colorado, Election Data Services is building a data basefor the GOP-controlled Legislature. Other clients includelegislative redistricting committees with bipartisan members.The fear of compromising political secrets is real, Mr. Braceconcedes. &quot;I have to be very, very careful,&quot; he says.   Redistricting involves using just-released 1990 censusdata to create voting districts that are as close to equal inpopulation as possible. In addition to satisfying the &quot;oneperson, one vote&quot; principle, revised districts must meetvarious Supreme Court -- and, in some cases, JusticeDepartment -- guidelines on fair representation forminorities. They must also pass muster with electedpoliticians who want constituencies likely to vote the rightway.   The old days of drawing and redrawing district lines withgrease pencils on paper maps have given way to the computerage. As a result, the revamping of districts now resembles avideo game. Move a census block from the 37th District to the36th District on a computer screen, press a button, and newpopulation totals for both districts flash on the screen.   The high-tech advances provide a redistricting window ofopportunity for software companies with expertise in computermapping integrated with data -- a niche known as geographicinformation systems, or GIS. Some have simply addedredistricting programs to their offerings.   &quot;It's a perfect fit for our system,&quot; says Mike Butler,president of Geographic Technology Inc., Bellingham, Wash. Hesays altering his company's software -- used for urbanplanning by such clients as Toronto's metropolitan governmentand Seoul, South Korea's police department -- forredistricting purposes &quot;took me one week of working until 2a.m.&quot; each day. &quot;It was a fairly easy application,&quot; he says.   Virginia's Legislature bought the company's redistrictingsoftware partly because it meshed well with the state's Wangminicomputer system. The cost: about $100,000.   Any group with a stake in how the boundary lines areredrawn can use such software to do a redistricting plan. InVirginia, the National Association for the Advancement ofColored People and the American Civil Liberties Union areamong 300 groups that have stored plans in the statelegislature's computer memory.   Geographic Data Technology Inc., Lyme, N.H., a pioneer inGIS technology, has sold redistricting software tolegislatures in several states, including California andSouth Carolina.   Mr. Brace's Election Data Services is different in that italso offers political expertise. His company uses GeographicData's software, then laboriously adds reams of population,racial and historic voting behavior data tailored to aclient's needs.   In Iowa, Election Data Services has a full-time employeein the state house to help members of the Republican andDemocratic legislative caucuses sketch new boundaries for thestate's five congressional districts and 150 statelegislative seats. For a fee of about $600,000, the companyhas prepared a statewide data base that includes populationand racial characteristics down to the city block and votinghistory by individual precincts.   Mr. Brace has also agreed to serve as an expert witness ifthe Iowa redistricting plan is eventually challenged incourt. In fact, expert witness fees for extended trialsinvolving 1980 redistricting in Rhode Island, Illinois andSouth Carolina helped keep the company alive in the 1980s. &quot;Ido redistricting, I go to court, then I do redistrictingagain. It's a crazy cycle,&quot; he says.   Mr. Brace, 39 years old, founded Election Data Services in1979, building on his experience as a political campaignresearcher for the NBC television network. &quot;I got tired ofwaiting around for politicians to come out of thosesmoke-filled rooms and say, `No comment.' I wanted to seewhat was going on inside,&quot; he says.   He says what he found as a redistricting insider wasendless hours in state capitol offices, sitting in front of acomputer screen, surrounded by legislative leaders andofficeholders mumbling sentences like: &quot;Geez, I need to keepthis area in my district, so how about getting rid of thisother area over here.&quot;   Tempers can fray. &quot;I was in a meeting where somebodypounded his fist on the table and broke the table,&quot; herecalls. On April 8, Mr. Brace was in state court in DesMoines, trying to prevent the disclosure of his software to agroup called Iowans Against Gerrymandering. The group saysElection Data's software has a Democratic bias. Mr. Bracesays his Iowa client is a bipartisan legislative staffcommittee and that Republicans have &quot;total access&quot; to theredistricting tools.   A Census Bureau breakthrough is largely responsible forthe small-business activity in redistricting. A highlydetailed computerized map of the U.S. created for the 1990census allows politicians and other interested parties forthe first time to perform the complex population mappingchores on a computer as small as a PC.   While Mr. Brace's company has built its entire businessaround redistricting, other computer-based companies see the1991 political realigning as a short-term profit opportunity.   Public Systems Associates Inc., Denver, is building on itscore business, tracking bills and other management mattersimportant to legislatures. &quot;We bring the expertise oflegislatures. Many of the other companies can't do that,&quot;says Craig Butler, the company's research director. PSA'sredistricting clients include Colorado, Oklahoma, NorthCarolina and Washington state.   Environmental Systems Research Institute Inc., Redlands,Calif., has similarly adapted its ARC/INFO software. &quot;We'vedone over $1 million in services related to redistricting&quot; inthe past 1 1/2 years, &quot;and we've sold roughly 150workstations for redistricting,&quot; says marketing official EarlNorstrand. The company's clients include Texas, Georgia,Mississippi, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Washington.   In Missoula, Mont., Logistics Systems Inc. has beenselling software that figures out efficient routes for schoolbuses, especially in cases involving court-ordered schooldesegregation. Carter Young, the company's marketingexecutive, says redistricting was an obvious diversification,since both voting patterns and school busing involve meshingpopulation figures with maps.   Asked if the company's inexperience with the sometimesvolatile world of electoral redistricting was a handicap, Mr.Young replies: &quot;We've had 12 years experience inredistricting school boundaries, and that's exceptionallypolitically charged.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
