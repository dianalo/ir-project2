The People's Liberation Army troops came out of the station, ranthrough the surrounding neighborhood and returned to their camp inthe station. But they did not approach Tiananmen Square just over amile away.   The square, the symbolic heart of China, has been occupied by upto 200,000 students since they launched their protests more thansix weeks ago. About 10,000 students are massed there now indefiance of martial law orders to leave.   The students, who have gained considerable support from ordinarycitizens, are demanding more democracy, an end to corruption amongofficials, and a dialogue with the government.   Instead, the government has engaged them in a war of nerves, andthis week's shows of force indicated that officials are poised toenforce martial law and put down the protest movement.   On Thursday, about 300 army troops marched within a block ofTiananmen Square on Thursday. National television showed hundredsof soldiers fast-stepping out of the city railroad station.   The previous day, a large procession of military motorcyclesroared through the capital.   Beijing citizens, in a show of support for the students, blockedtroops from entering the city after the government declared martiallaw on May 20.   But residents for the moment are subdued as the government wagesa propaganda campaign warns that participants in pro-democracyrallies face pay cuts and other punishment.   A city spokesman issued a stern warning Thursday to foreignjournalists, saying they were banned from covering student protestsand that all media coverage in the capital must receive priorapproval by city officials.   Ding Weijun also said foreign journalists are not allowed toinvite Chinese citizens to their offices, residences or hotels``for interviews on activities prohibited'' under martial law.   The Foreign Correspondents Club of China said the regulationswere a ``deplorable case of press censorship and harassment'' andurged the Beijing government to rescind the restrictions.   Ding's seven-point statement, read at a weekly Foreign Ministrybriefing, expanded on martial law regulations banning foreign presscoverage of the student protests. The restrictions include a ban onphotographing or videotaping military troops.   Beijing-based foreign journalists and hundreds more who havecome to cover the protests had faced few problems until this week,when police warned at least two U.S. television networks and aJapanese network that their crews were violating martial lawregulations.   Police also summoned a correspondent for the Japanese dailyYomiuri Shimbun for a warning, and on Thursday the BritishBroadcasting Corp. was called in.   Late Thursday night, a few hundred students protested in frontof police headquarters, claiming that officers had beaten aJapanese reporter and two students.   The confrontation between the students and authorities took astrange twist on Thursday when hundreds of students disrupted apro-government rally in a village north of Beijing.   Thousands of farmers and workers, many ordered by localofficials or employers to attend the rally, were silenced whentheir slogans of support for Premier Li Peng's hard-line policieswere drowned out by the students' shouts for Li's resignation.   In another propaganda face-off, the students entertainedthousands of children on Tiananmen Square to offset governmentcharges they had disrupted Children's Day celebrations planned forthe plaza, which the students took over on May 13.   Children brought popsicles, stuffed animals and money for thestudents, who signed autographs with such messages as, ``When yougo to college, may you never have to endure the hardship of ahunger strike.''   Also on Thursday, student activists announced the creation of anationwide student group intended to end a rift between Beijingstudents and others from outside the city.   The students have grown increasingly divided over whether toremain on the square and how to keep their faltering movement alive.   Some student leaders claimed that four members of thenon-Beijing faction entered the tent of Beijing activist Chai Lingearly Thursday and tried to gag and kidnap her. They said theanti-Beijing faction cut loudspeaker wires when Chai later tried totell others on the square about the incident.</TEXT></DOC>
