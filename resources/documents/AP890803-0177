In addition, private experts said the Revolutionary JusticeOrganization, the pro-Iranian group holding Cicippio, also may havereached their decision to suspend the death sentence after decidingCicippio was worth more alive than dead.   For days, U.S. diplomats were in contact with countries whichhad either access to or influence with Iran, the country whose leadthe Lebanese Shiites follow.   Perhaps carried along by the international outcry that followedthe reported hanging on Monday of Lt. Col. William Higgins, bothSyria and the Soviet Union made diplomatic appeals on Cicippio'sbehalf.   But the apparent intervention by Iran's leadership, U.S.officials said, may have been decisive. Iran's new president, AliAkbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, expressed regret Tuesday over thereported death of Higgins and condemned terrorist acts in general.   A shift in Iran's suppoort for international terrorism couldeventually lead to steps toward an accommodation between the twoone-time allies, American officials have said.   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Iranhad been the target of an intense U.S. diplomatic campaign thatincluded a variety of channels.   ``At this time we have no reason to believe that Iran is notdealing with this matter in a serious way,'' she said, speakingless than two hours before the announcement of Cicippio's reprieve.   But officials cautioned Cicippio and the remaining sevenAmerican hostages still face danger. They noted the RevolutionaryJustice Organization statement did not drop its demand that Israelfree Shiek Abdul Karim Obeid, the Shiite cleric kidnapped lastFriday by Israeli commandos.   The statement said acceptance of the demand ``should beannounced within days, otherwise the initiative will be consideredcanceled.'' This implied the death sentence for Cicippio would bereimposed.   Still, announcement of the reprieve lowered the temperature hereconsiderably. A sense of anxiety had permeated the administrationsince Monday when Higgins' execution was announced and was followedquickly by the announcement that Cicippio would be next.   The execution of Cicippio, officials said, almost certainlywould have triggered a response by President Bush, possiblyincluding military action. This, in turn, would have polarizedfactions in the Middle East even more.   Geoffrey Kemp, a National Security Council official in theReagan administration, attributed the repreive partly to therealization by the Revolutionary Justice Organization that anyleverage they believe Ciccipio gives them would have died with hisexecution.   ``He's not worth anything dead,'' said Kemp. He suggested theorganization had to take seriously the views of Iranian officialswho want to renew relationships with the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
