Under the accord, Dow Jones andamp; Co. and the Associated Press each will sell to Telerate their separate holdings of 24.8% in AP-Dow Jones/Telerate Co., which operates Telerate's financial information network outside North America.    The Associated Press and Dow Jones will continue their joint ownership and operation of a separate concern, AP-Dow Jones, which operates newswires that provide subscribers in 40 countries with business and financial information.    Telerate agreed to pay the Associated Press $6.5 million in cash immediately and $58.5 million in installments over 15 years.    Telerate -- of which Dow Jones and Oklahoma Publishing Co., a media concern, together currently own 52% -- would pay 2.6 million shares to Dow Jones. The shares would boost Dow Jones's stake in Telerate to 35.4% from the current 31.6%. The purchase is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 1987.    Based on Telerate's closing stock price of $28.25, up $2, yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the 2.6 million shares have a current market value of $73.5 million.    A spokesman for Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, said the transaction would produce a capital gain of approximately $25 million, or about 26 cents a share, which is expected to be recorded in the 1987 first quarter. In the 1986 first quarter Dow Jones's profit was $61.8 million, or 64 cents a share adjusted for a 50% stock dividend paid as Class B shares; profit included a one-time gain of $31.4 million, or 32 cents a share, from the sale of an investment.    Neil S. Hirsch, president and chief executive officer of Telerate, said, &quot;Our long-term investment here will position us to capitalize on the unprecedented growth of world capital markets and their need for on-line financial information.&quot;    In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, Telerate's earnings increased 16% to $38.8 million, or 87 cents a share, from $33.4 million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 42% to $210.4 million from $148.5 million. </TEXT></DOC>
