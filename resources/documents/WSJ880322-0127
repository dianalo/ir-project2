The prospect is alarming enough that State Department spokesman Charles Redman hinted Friday that the U.S. is in fact bringing pressure on the Chinese to block the sale.    The point is that this particular missile is part of a nuclear-weapons system. It has a range of 1,500 to 1,800 miles, perhaps more according to some estimates, and can carry nuclear weapons with the explosive power of two million to three million tons of TNT. Its guidance system is not accurate enough to ensure damage to any reasonable military target with much smaller conventional warheads.    The Saudis have denied vigorously that they plan to equip the East Winds with nuclear warheads. But Western experts are asking why even a well-heeled nation would buy missiles of this size and cost merely for the purpose of firing conventional warheads.    Denials of any intent to go nuclear are pretty much the standard for nations with such intentions. If a nation is widely believed to be nuclear-capable, or about to become so, the same deterrent effect can be had with a denial as with an admission, and there are fewer liabilities. Given the amount of plutonium in the world, producing a nuclear weapon is no longer the prodigious task it once was.    Of course, the Saudis do have legitimate defense concerns. Congress blocked the sale of 48 F-15 fighters to them, and they can argue that this leaves them without sufficient defensive capabilities. They could argue that Iran, not Israel, is their main threat. The missile war between Iran and Iraq has been escalating and the Saudis reportedly are concerned about the possibility of Iranian attacks on Saudi oil-production facilities. Finally, they could argue that Israel is widely thought to have nuclear capabilities.    The U.S. reply should be that, first of all, it's hard to see how Saudi security is enhanced by missiles that can't hit anything if armed with the warheads the Saudis say they are. Anyway, the F-15s aside, Saudi Arabia's national-security needs have had a great deal of attention from the U.S. U.S.-supplied AWACs patrol Saudi skies, for example. An Iranian attack on the Saudis would be regarded as an assault on the Western oil lifeline and invite international retaliation. Saudi security is best served by staying under the Western umbrella, not moving independently from it. And finally, if the Israelis feel seriously threatened, they have demonstrated a willingness to act unilaterally, as they did in destroying an Iraqi reactor believed to be weapons-capable.    The East Wind missile sale reportedly came up when Secretary of State Shultz met with China's top foreign affairs official, Wu Xueqian, earlier this month. Mr. Wu, in a speech to the National Press Club, displayed some sensitivity to such issues by saying that China had taken steps to stop further sales of Chinese Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran. Iran has used Silkworms to threaten shipping passing through the Strait of Hormuz.    China wants good relations with the West, not to mention technology and credits, and it's appropriate for the U.S. to stress that this bears a price in reasonable behavior. Surely this includes abstaining from peddling nuclear-weapons vehicles in the Middle East, a part of the world that already has more than enough problems. </TEXT></DOC>
