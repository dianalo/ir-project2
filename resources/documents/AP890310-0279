(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chief prosecutor in the Pentagonpurchasing scandal says cooperation from three businessmen who havepleaded guilty will help him move ahead on the case at a``tremendous pace.''   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson commented Thursday after the threepleaded guilty to a variety of charges stemming from the 2{-year-oldinvestigation _ code-named ``Operation Ill Wind'' _ of thePentagon's $150-billion-a-year purchasing practices.   One of the men who pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court wasCharles F. Gardner, 58, former general manager of Unisys Corp.'ssurveillance and fire control systems division in Great Neck, N.Y.   Gardner admitted bribing Melvyn Paisley, the former assistantsecretary of the Navy for research, engineering and systems, bybuying Paisley's condominium in Sun Valley, Idaho, for an inflatedprice in 1986, and to funnelling illegal corporate contributions tocongressional campaigns.   ``These pleas of guilty ... are significant developments not onlybecause of what they demonstrate in themselves, but also because thecooperation we will receive from these three individuals will movethis investigation forward at ... a tremendous pace,'' Hudson said.   James G. Neal and Kenneth F. Brooke, both private consultants,pleaded guilty to other charges before U.S. District Court JudgeClaude Hylton. Neal, a consultant to Unisys, worked closely withGardner, prosecutors said in court documents. Gardner also workedwith William Galvin, a private consultant who is Brooke's stepfather.   Neal admitted conspiring to bribe Garland Tomlin Jr., who was aNavy engineer with the Naval Electronics systems Command until hisretirement in October 1985.   On instructions from Gardner, Neal transferred in 1983 and 1984 atotal of $400,000 to a Longwood International, a company in Nassau,Bahamas owned by Tomlin in order to influence Tomlin's decisions,the government said. Tomlin has not been charged with any crime.   Gardner was charged in a criminal information with three counts,including bribery, conspiracy to commit bribery and file falsestatements and aiding and assisting in the filing of a false taxreturn. He faces a maximum sentence of 23 years in prison and finesof up to $750,000.   Prosecutors said Gardner amassed a slush fund by hiring``consultants'' to Unisys with the understanding that some moneywould be placed ``in bank accounts, both domestic and foreign, forpurposes of bribery, illegal campaign contributions, and in part for... Gardner's personal use.''   The government also said Gardner caused Unisys to ``make andpresent to the departments of the Navy and Air Force false,fictitious and fraudulent claims upon and against the UnitedStates.''   Unisys, a giant computer company with headquarters in Blue Bell,Pa., said in a statement that it had cooperated with the governmentand welcomed Gardner's guilty pleas.   ``What has been uncovered is a deliberate fraud and othercriminal activities, carefully disguised by a small group of formerSperry employees and consultants,'' the company said. Unisys is asuccessor to Sperry Corp.   The government said Gardner, at Galvin's suggestion, arranged tohave Neal buy Paisley's resort condominium in August 1986 for$149,000, a price above fair market value. A year later the propertysold for $100,000.   Hudson said the condominium purchase was designed to influencePaisley's actions on two Pentagon contracts sought by Unisys, one onthe Aegis automated radar firing system and the other on the Marineair traffic and landing system. Unisys eventually received a portionof the $9 billion Aegis contract.   Paisley, now a private consultant, has not been charged with anycrime, but prosecutors said he ``performed certain official acts tobenefit'' Unisys with regard to the two contracts.   Gardner also caused illegal $1,000 corporate contributions to bemade in 1986 and 1987 to the campaigns of Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., andformer Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., both members of a House committeethat handled defense issues. Dyson and Chappell have denied knowingthat illegal contributions were funnelled to their campaigns.   In January, Robert D. Barrett, a former Unisys executive, pleadedguilty in January to charges stemming from the complicated scheme tomake illegal campaign contributions.   Prosecutors spelled out an elaborate network of companies inNorthern Virginia that Neal set up at Gardner's request to receivemoney from Unisys and Sperry.   Neal also pleaded guilty to making false claims to the governmentand conspiring to defraud the government by concealing his truetaxable income. He faces up to 15 years in prison and fines of$750,000.   Brooke, 40, pleaded guilty to evading about $66,000 in taxes in1985, prosecutors said. He faces a sentence of five years in prisonand a fine of up to $250,000.</TEXT></DOC>
