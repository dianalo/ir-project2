Neighboring Appenzell Inner-Rhodes now is the only one ofSwitzerland's 26 sovereign states, or cantons, that still denieswomen the vote on local issues ranging from budget questions toalcohol laws.   The issue was by no means clear-cut in Appenzell Outer-Rhodes, acanton of 50,000 people.   Four times in the past 17 years the state parliament _ anopen-air assembly comprised of all the state's eligible voters _has rejected women's suffrage.   Emotions ran high Sunday as the men, bearing swords as a sign oftheir voting eligibility, began gathering in Hundwil for the latestvote.   A seemingly equal number of hands were raised by those on bothsides of the issue. The pronouncement by local official Hans UliHoehl that a majority had voted ``yes'' was greeted by shouts ofsurprise and some jeers.   ``A tradition has been destroyed,'' commented one man.   State authorities had urged acceptance of the proposal to letwomen participate in the Landsgemeinde, or parliament, because offears the Swiss government would act unilaterally and imposefederal legislation ensuring equal voting rights.   Women won the national vote in a 1971 referendum. Ten yearslater, another nationwide poll changed the constitution to make``all Swiss equal before the law.''   The debate on women's rights has raged for many years inAppenzell. Many men argued that allowing women to participate inthe local popular parliament, the original form of Switzerland'sdirect democracy, would damage the unique atmosphere of theLandsgemeinde.   A substantial number of women seemed to share that view. A1986-87 survey, in which half the adult population of AppenzellOuter-Rhodes took part, found only 57 percent of women favoredhaving the right to vote.   At Sunday's meeting, the parliament also agreed to vote before1993 on whether to abolish itself, replacing the once-a-yearLandsgemeinde with another system.   Only five cantons in northeastern Switzerland still retain theLandsgemeinde.</TEXT></DOC>
