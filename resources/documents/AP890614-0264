BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A New York buyout firm Wednesday offered up to$78.2 million for control of Recognition Equipment Inc., a Texascompany that has been the focus of federal investigations intobid-rigging at the U.S. Postal Service.   The tender offer by The Prospect Group Inc. is the second time insix months the company has made an unsolicited bid for REI. Theprevious bid of $12.75 per share was rejected by the company as``highly conditional.''   Prospect's later offer, to expire at midnight EDT July 12, is for$11 per share for up to 7.11 million shares, or 81 percent of theoutstanding stock. Prospect already owns 1.43 million shares, or14.1 percent, of REI.   The offer is conditional on Prospect receiving enough shares togain control; revocation of the company's shareholders rights;revocation of limitations placed on mergers by the company's bylaws;and on financing.   REI had no immediate comment on the bid.   REI, former Chairman William G. Moore Jr. and former vicepresident Robert W. Reedy have been indicted on charges theyconspiring to rig a bid involving U.S. Postal Service procurementprocess to win millions of dollars in contracts for automatedmail-sorting equipment.   A September trial in Washington is set.   The indictment says the conspiracy involved a plot to replacePostmaster General Paul N. Carlin, who was viewed as hostile to REI.   The conspiracy allegedly included Peter E. Voss, former vicechairman of the Postal Services' Board of Governors, who is nowserving a four-year prison term for kickback and expense accountfraud and is cooperating in the case.   After the indictment, REI was suspended from bidding on contractsfor the U.S. Army and Postal Service. The Army suspension has beenlifted, but the Postal Service suspension was renewed last week foranother 120 days.   Prospect, which lost $4.32 million on $22.6 million in revenuesin the first quarter, recently bought Illinois CentralTransportation Co., a rail freight carrier. Its other interests arein insurance, consumer and services industries.</TEXT></DOC>
