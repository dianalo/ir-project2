(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After flying into about 200 hurricanes,Bob Sheets doesn't appear at all fazed by his responsibility asdirector of the National Hurricane Center to predict the path of theferocious storms.   Sheets, 52, friendly and low-key, is in his third season as headof the worldwide command center for hurricane data in this suburb ofMiami.   ``You look out there and see the chaos ... but it really works,''he said Wednesday while surveying the low-ceiling, wide-open roomjammed with forecasters and reporters, cameramen and photographerscovering Hurricane Hugo.   Hugo, whose winds dropped to 105 mph after churning through theCaribbean, is the most powerful of nine named storms this year, sixof which became hurricanes. Storms like Hugo make Sheets a householdname.   Killer hurricanes like Hugo, which left at least 25 dead, tens ofthousands homeless and millions of dollars in damages in its rampagethrough the eastern Caribbean, make Sheets a household name whenthey threaten the U.S. mainland.   A typical half hour for Sheets: do live feeds for the networksand local television stations; squeeze in a few minutes with a printreporter; grab a phone to talk with a government official in MyrtleBeach, S.C.; consult with his team of forecasters on incoming data.   Then it starts all over again.   ``He's a cool, collected person _ the ideal person for thispressure job,'' said Gil Clark, a 34-year veteran of the hurricanecenter. ``He's got a real feeling for hurricanes and everything thatgoes with it.''   Sheets also gets high marks from his colleagues for scientificability and poise.   ``He worked here as a forecaster before becoming deputy directorand then director,'' said hurricane specialist Hal Gerrish. ``He'snot just an administrator. He can sit down and be able to pull oneof the shifts with us.''   One of the biggest pressures on Sheets is to pinpoint where ahurricane will blast ashore _ a decision that can result inevacuations and huge expenditures. It is one of his biggestfrustrations.   ``It's frustrating not to be able to say with a great deal ofconfidence this is where it's going to move,'' said Sheets.   Hugo has been an especially difficult storm to forecast beyond acouple of days, but he said the devastation in the Caribbean hadbeen lessened because of forecasts and warnings issued by the center.   Sheets, in 16 years of research flights, had his share of closecalls flying into the eye of hurricanes. He says he finds hiscurrent job very fulfilling despite offers to join reconnaissancecrews checking Hugo.   ``There's nothing there that I need to go and experience again,''he said, grinning.</TEXT></DOC>
