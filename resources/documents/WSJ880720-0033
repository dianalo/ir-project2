Bottom lines fattened even though earnings from exploration and production fell almost everywhere in the industry, according to analysts, consultants and industry officials. The price of crude oil averaged about $2 a barrel less in the second quarter than a year earlier, while long-depressed natural gas prices plunged anew after winter.    But prices for petrochemicals, already in strong demand, kept skyrocketing, and widening margins for gasoline and other refined products more than offset the decline in exploration and production, or &quot;upstream,&quot; earnings.    This pattern was &quot;not too different from the first quarter,&quot; said Paul B. Ting, analyst at Oppenheimer andamp; Co. in New York, except that chemical and gasoline profits were even higher for some companies. In addition, the year-to-year comparison in those &quot;downstream,&quot; or refining and marketing, operations look even better because of weakness a year earlier. Big companies are expected to start reporting earnings late this week or early next.    Companies with heavy emphasis on chemicals -- such as Amoco Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. -- should do particulary well in today's lower-energy-price environment. Crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are the feedstocks for many chemical products, so an increase in chemical prices tends to go straight to the bottom line.    And those prices have been booming. For instance, just since Occidental Petroleum agreed to acquire Cain Chemical Inc. in mid-April, the price of ethylene -- a widely used base petrochemical -- has risen about six cents a pound to roughly 30 cents a pound, double what it was a year ago.    The same scenario goes for gasoline. Drivers are pulling up to the pump so frequently that refineries are going flat out and still not meeting demand. At the same time, as crude-oil prices plunge further, margins grow even wider, heading directly into company profits.    Companies that are mostly refiners and marketers -- Ashland Oil Inc., Diamond Shamrock Randamp;M, Tosco Corp. and American Petrofina Inc., for instance -- should get the biggest boost from wider gasoline margins. These companies have few or no oil and gas reserves of their own.    Here are second-quarter earnings synopses of the 10 largest U.S.-based oil companies, according to analysts, consultants and industry officials. All earnings estimates are per share, and comparisons are with the 1987 second quarter.    Amoco Corp.    Although it is increasingly dependent on natural gas prices, which have been weak, Amoco is also highly leveraged in its chemical operations, where it is expected to post record earnings. In addition, &quot;Amoco is just printing money in refining and marketing,&quot; says Bryan Jacoboski, senior oil analyst at PaineWebber Inc. The Chicago-based company is expected to post a huge profit increase, to about $2.05 from $1.22.    Atlantic Richfield Co.    The Los Angeles-based company is a dominant West Coast refiner and marketer, and profit margins in its sales territory were extremely high. Atlantic Richfield, with a strong chemical business, is expected to post a jump in earnings to around $2.05 from $1.80.    Chevron Corp.    The San Francisco-based company's downstream operations will more than offset declines in exploration and production. It is expected to post net income of around $1.60, up from $1.04. Chevron's sale of a 15.5% stake in Amax Inc., a mining concern, back to that company will result in a gain of around 45 cents.    Exxon Corp.    The New York concern is less sensitive to energy-price changes than in the past because of extensive refining and marketing operations, a strong chemical business and a cost-saving restructuring. &quot;They plod forward irrespective of oil and gas prices,&quot; Mr. Jacoboski says. Exxon is expected to post net of around 95 cents, up from 81 cents.    Mobil Corp.    The New York concern likewise made up on the downstream side the reduced earnings from upstream operations. Mobil is expected to post earnings of about $1.10, up from 74 cents.    Occidental Petroleum Corp.    The company, based in Los Angeles, has become as dependent on the booming chemical market as any other oil company. By one estimate, Occidental's oil and gas earnings have fallen to 29% of total earnings from 85% in 1985, while its chemical profit has risen to 38% of the total from 9%. Earnings estimates range from about 20 cents to 45 cents, compared with 23 cents.    Phillips Petroleum Co.    The company, based in Bartlesville, Okla., is another large beneficiary of the booming demand for chemicals and plastics; those operations could account for 60% of total earnings. Phillips continued to pare costs and could earn about 45 cents. It had a small loss a year earlier.    Sun Co.    The Radnor, Pa., concern is especially sensitive to refining and marketing margins, and earnings will reflect their width. The company doesn't have large chemical operations. Sun, which plans to split its upstream and downstream operations into two companies, is expected to have earned around 75 cents, a decline from net of 82 cents but up from last year's operating profit.    Texaco Inc.    Earnings estimates for the White Plains, N.Y., concern are anybody's guess because of the continuing sale of assets combined with unusually high legal and other costs from its bankruptcy-court proceedings and proxy fight. Texaco should benefit because of its extensive refining and marketing operations, but its chemical business is relatively small. Estimates of operating profit range from about 75 cents to 90 cents, up from net of 53 cents a year earlier.    Unocal Corp.    The Los Angeles company will be the industry laggard, as in the first quarter. Unocal is more dependent on the price of oil and natural gas than most others, and it has relatively weak refining, marketing and chemical operations. Profit estimates range from about 30 cents to 45 cents, down from 53 cents.    ---            Energy Prices and the Bottom Line   How annual per share earnings are affected by various price changes.
