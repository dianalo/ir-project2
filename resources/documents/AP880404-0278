The bank board has set a goal of boosting the minimum capitalrequirement for Sandamp;Ls eventually to 6 percent of assets, up from aninitial 3 percent level set last year.   The rule change announced Monday affects the calculation used todetermine how much the capital requirement will be boosted eachyear.   Officials said the change was required because the oldcalculation method would have resulted in the minimum capitalrequirement declining this year, reflecting the record $6.8 billionthat federally insured Sandamp;Ls lost in 1987.   The old process involved adding up total industry earnings anddividing by total assets. Under the new procedure, theprofitability of each Sandamp;L will be determined and then a mid-pointlevel will be selected and that figure will be used to set theincrease in capital which will be required.   Brian Smith, director of regulatory affairs for the U.S. Leagueof Savings Institutions, said the industry had no objection to thechange.   ``We understand that average earnings results were verydistorted,'' he said. ``For the bulk of the business that is notdoing too badly, this makes sense.''   The bank board gave no estimate of what the new minimum capitalrequirement will be, but Smith estimated it could rise to around3.4 percent. The new capital requirement will take effect for thequarter beginning on July 1.   Use of the new rule will reduce the time required to reach the 6percent requirement to less than 12 years, the bank board said, asopposed to an estimated 40 years using the old process.   The change on capital requirements followed a decision lastFriday by the bank board to prevent a planned drop in the specialassessments being levied on Sandamp;Ls.   The board voted to continue the special assessment rate of1-32nd of 1 percent of insured deposits for the first quarter of1988. That is added to the one-twelfth of 1 percent that iscollected from both banks and Sandamp;Ls as the standard fee for insuringindividual deposits up to a maximum of $100,000.   Congress last year, in passing a measured aimed at bailing atthe insolvent Sandamp;L insurance fund, had called for the surcharge tobegin declining unless the bank board blocked the drop inassessments.   For the past two quarters, the bank board has vetoed anyassessment decline. Officials justify the action on the groundsthat growing losses at Sandamp;Ls prevent any move to allow theassessment to decline.   However, the U.S. League, the industry's biggest lobbying group,attacked that decision saying that it ``flies in the face of theunderstanding between savings institutions and the administration''made last summer when Congress authorized the assessments.   The bank board has said it will announce sometime this week aproposed plan for a new variable assessment program that would freethe best-capitalized Sandamp;Ls from paying the surcharge.   This proposal is aimed at keeping healthy savings and loans fromleaving the ailing Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., whichinsures Sandamp;Ls, for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., whichinsures banks and has no surcharge.   Such shifts will be permitted after Aug. 10 unless Congressdecides to block them. While Sandamp;Ls which decided to make the movewould be charged an exit fee, they would be able to earn that moneyback in only a few years through the lower insurance costs.</TEXT></DOC>
