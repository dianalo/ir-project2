The $14 million represents the balance of a $23 million conciliation agreement reached between Ford and the EEOC in 1980 to settle a nationwide employment discrimination complaint against the auto maker.    Under the agreement, Ford didn't admit discrimination, but agreed to pay as much as $13 million in awards to individuals who unsuccessfuly applied for jobs or promotions. The company also agreed to spend as much as $10 million in training, apprenticeship and other affirmative action programs, and to increase its hiring of minorities and women. EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas said a drop in Ford's work force has made some of the original provisions impossible to enforce.    Under the new agreement, Ford will spend about $2 million to enhance math and science programs in Detroit, Cleveland and Chicago, and on programs designed to attract minority and female students to those subjects.    Ford and the EEOC also will spend $5.5 million to endow scholarships for minorities and women at as many as 40 colleges and universities. The company also plans continued training for Ford managers, and a business support program for Ford's minority suppliers. </TEXT></DOC>
