(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A lawyer who challenged the reorganizationplan of the A.H. Robins Co. said Friday his clients would acceptwithout further appeal the plan's $2.5 billion compensation packagefor Dalkon Shield claimants if Robins would fund the packagepending a limited appeal on a separate issue.   However, lawyers for Robins have rejected the proposal by AlanB. Morrison of the Washington-based Public Citizen LitigationGroup. ``We don't believe his proposal affords the basis fornegotiations or discussion,'' said Roscoe Puckett, a Robins'spokesman.   Robins, which filed for protection from creditors under Chapter11 of the federal bankruptcy law in August 1985 as claims mountedagainst the birth control device, would be acquired by the NewYork-based American Home Products Corp. under a reorganizationapproved in federal court last summer and upheld by the 4th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals on June 16.   Morrison, who has until Sept. 14 to ask the U.S. Supreme Courtto review the case, wrote a letter June 28 to Robins' attorneyssaying that a tentative decision had been reached to seek such areview.   However, Morrison wrote, the petition to the high court would belimited to the reorganization plan's injunction that bars DalkonShield injury lawsuits against Robins' officers and other thirdparties if Robins and AHP would complete the merger pending thatappeal and fund the $2.5 billion trust.   The trust is to pay the claims of some 195,000 women who saidthey were injured by the intrauterine device, which Robins sold inthe early 1970s.   Robins has insisted on a final court resolution of the entirereorganization before funding the trust, and Robins' attorneys, ina letter dated July 13, rejected Morrison's offer to separate theinjunction issue.   ``We firmly believe that further appeals of the plan,particularly after five judges have considered it and have judgedit proper, are not in, and indeed are contrary to, the bestinterests of the Dalkon Shield claimants and other constituenciesof Robins,'' said the reply, signed by attorneys James C. Robertsand Alesia Ranney-Marinelli of the Mays andamp; Valentine law firm ofRichmond.   Morrison said his clients want to pursue allegations thatcertain officers of Robins and others, including attorneys whorepresented the company in earlier Dalkon Shield litigation,conspired to cover up evidence about knowledge of flaws in the IUD.   Women who used the device have raised injury claims ranging frompelvic infections to sterility to fetal deformities.   In a follow-up letter Thursday to Robins' lawyers, Morrison saidRobins' shareholders, in addition to Dalkon Shield claimants, wouldbenefit from a separation of the merger-trust fund issues and theinjunction issue because the stockholders would be paid for theirRobins' shares without further delay.   The merger with AHP involves a $700 million exchange of stock.   The company's chairman, E.C. Robins Sr., and its president, E.Claiborne Robins Jr., ``are the principal beneficiaries of theinjunctions included in the plan,'' Morrison wrote.   Morrison, whose initial offer was made only to Robins, sentcopies of his second letter and the prior correspondence toattorneys for Dalkon Shield claimants and Robins' stockholders inwhat he acknowledged was an effort to put pressure on Robins toreconsider the separation issue.   Neither Mark Ellenberg, a lawyer for the claimants, nor RobertMiller, the stockholders' attorney, could be reached immediately.   Morrison said in his second letter that no final decision hasbeen reached on whether to go to the Supreme Court.   During the appeal of the case, only $100 million of the $2.5billion trust package has been available to pay Dalkon Shieldclaims.   More than 95 percent of claimants who participated in ballotingon whether to approve the reorganization plan voted for it.   Morrison argued in the appeal before the 4th Circuit that thevotes should have been weighted so that women with larger claimswould have a greater voice in deciding the issue.</TEXT></DOC>
