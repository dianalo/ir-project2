Since a settlement proposal was presented to the companyby federal and state officials Tuesday, there have beencontinuing talks in which Exxon officials have said they arelooking to strike a less costly agreement. &quot;Exxon isposturing; it hasn't just jumped on the bandwagon,&quot; said oneindividual familiar with the talks. &quot;Exxon is trying tofigure out whether to pay out the figure requested just toget rid of the litigation, but it says $1.2 billion is a lotof money.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   It isn't clear what figure Exxon, based in Dallas, wouldfind attractive, although it has become abundantly clear tonegotiators that the number doesn't approach the $1.2 billionfederal-state offer. In fact, following scuttled settlementtalks last year, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said thatif convicted on all counts of criminal felony and misdemeanorcharges arising from the spill, the company could face finesexceeding $600 million.   And as a key element of last year's failed pact, Exxon didagree to set up a restoration fund of $550 million.   Exxon declined to comment.   Individuals involved with the talks say that if there is asettlement, it would have to be struck sometime within thenext month. After that period, state and federal litigationwill proceed. &quot;Then the window of opportunity closes,&quot; onenegotiator said.   The settlement offer calls for Exxon to pay $1.2 billioninto a restoration fund while providing the company with arelease from potential federal and pending state civillitigation. Individuals familiar with the talks say that theJustice Department is prepared to join the effort and releasethe company from criminal liability as well. But JusticeDepartment officials have insisted they aren't negotiatingwith Exxon and intend to proceed with the criminal trialApril 10.</TEXT></DOC>
