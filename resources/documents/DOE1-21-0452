Beside the observance of predefined poleregions to ensure the stability of the closed-loop system the methodpresented in this paper allows for disturbance rejection in a straightforwardmanner. First of all the structure of a dynamic state space regulatoris selected to guarantee zero offset of the control variables and thenthe remaining degrees of freedom are used to optimize the dynamic behaviourof the system with regard to constant disturbances.</TEXT></DOC>
