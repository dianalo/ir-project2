Mossberg (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> MON FRX </IN><G> TRE FED EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady declared that &quot;the administration remains committed to exchange market stability,&quot; rebuffing persistent market rumors that the U.S. now favors a further fall in the dollar.    Mr. Brady added that &quot;the key to that stability is the economic policy coordination process&quot; among the seven largest industrial countries, &quot;including cooperation in exchange markets.&quot;    The Treasury secretary's comment came in the form of a statement issued by his office yesterday to The Wall Street Journal in response to a question. It followed a week of sharp decline in the value of the dollar, fed by speculation that the U.S. and other major nations favored such a post-election drop. The statement is particularly significant because Mr. Brady is not only the Reagan administration's top economic policy official but is likely to be nominated shortly to be President-elect George Bush's Treasury secretary as well. He is a close friend and adviser to Mr. Bush.    U.S. officials made it clear that Mr. Brady wanted markets to understand that the U.S. isn't seeking a lower dollar. They said the U.S. remains committed, with the other members of the so-called Group of Seven nations, to the same exchange rate policies they first adopted jointly last Dec. 22. Those policies call for stabilizing the dollar within a secret range of exchange rate values.    By using the phrase &quot;cooperation in exchange markets,&quot; which the seven governments have used before to warn currency traders, Mr. Brady was hinting that the countries are prepared to continue intervening in currency markets to support the dollar and keep it within that range, as they have throughout 1988.    On Monday morning in Tokyo, Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's finance minister, said there would be &quot;aggressive intervention&quot; in the market if currency rates were unstable. His comment came against a backdrop of reported early intervention by the Bank of Japan to bolster the dollar as it slipped below 122.55 yen at the opening, its lowest opening since last Jan. 4's 120.45 yen.    The Treasury secretary's statement is his first public comment on the dollar since the election. But his emphasis on stability was echoed in background interviews in recent days with other U.S. policy makers. They stressed that, despite speculation to the contrary in the currency markets, the G-7 countries never had any plan to lower their target range for the dollar after the election.    Even at its current low level, they added, the dollar is still within the agreed-upon range, which hasn't been disclosed. They said that barring a financial or market crisis, the G-7 isn't likely to meet until January at the earliest.    &quot;On dollar policy, we are just where we've been all year,&quot; said one official. &quot;Whatever levels we've been defending, it can be assumed we'll continue to defend.&quot;    Still, if downward pressure on the dollar persists, it could force the G-7 to meet sooner than expected or prompt some symbolic step -- such as a reassuring public statement from Mr. Bush himself on dollar stability or the desire for budget deficit reduction. Mr. Bush can't placate markets with actual economic policy changes until he takes office Jan. 20.    A key turning point for the dollar could come Wednesday, when the Commerce Department is due to release figures on merchandise trade for September. If they show a higher-than expected deficit, downward pressure on the dollar could intensify and the G-7 might be compelled to retreat from its current target range and support the dollar at lower levels. But if the deficit is in line with, or lower than, market expectations, the pressure could be off for a while.    U.S. officials have been expecting financial markets and foreign governments to press Mr. Bush and the Democratic Congress to adopt firm and significant measures to cut the budget deficit once they take office. But they find the current market pressure illogical and dangerous.    &quot;Some of these currency traders apparently think we have a parliamentary system, where the prime minister and parliament take power instantly after elections and can make changes right away,&quot; said a top official. &quot;They just don't understand the realities of the U.S. system.&quot;    The U.S. officials decried rumors that Mr. Bush or Secretary of State-designate James Baker favor dropping the dollar below the range in which it has fluctuated during 1988. And they voiced irritation that the markets apparently took it as Bush policy when economist Martin Feldstein, a Bush campaign adviser, recently repeated his well-worn call for a lower dollar.    Mr. Feldstein said he wasn't speaking for the president-elect -- a point underscored yesterday by Craig Fuller, Mr. Bush's current chief of staff and the co-director of his transition team. &quot;He's not supported what Marty Feldstein said,&quot; Mr. Fuller said on NBC-TV's &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; Seeking a lower dollar &quot;is not the policy of this administration, and it's not going to be the policy of the next administration,&quot; Mr. Fuller said.    U.S. officials noted further that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who will remain at his post when Mr. Bush takes office, was an architect of the current dollar policy, as was Mr. Baker, who engineered the Dec. 22 declaration while he was Treasury secretary.    The secret G-7 range for the dollar, which the governments define as a zone of &quot;stability,&quot; is believed to be roughly 120 to 140 Japanese yen to the dollar and 1.60 to 1.90 West German marks to the dollar. But the end points are somewhat flexible, and the seven countries have sometimes permitted the bounds to be breached briefly before driving exchange rates back into line. The G-7 countries are the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.    Last summer, the governments battled traders to keep the dollar from exceeding the top of the range, especially against the mark. But in recent weeks, the markets have driven the dollar toward the bottom of the range, especially against the yen, for the first time since last spring.    Many private forecasters contend the dollar must go lower if improvements in the U.S. trade deficit are to continue. But both the Treasury and the Federal Reserve believe the private economic models underestimate the prospects for continued U.S. trade improvement even at current exchange rates. They fear that lowering the dollar now would cause a surge in orders for U.S. exports that couldn't be met because American factories are operating at near full capacity. They believe the result would be inflation, which could cause the Fed to raise interest rates and risk a recession. </TEXT></DOC>
