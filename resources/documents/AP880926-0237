The small, overall decline compares to last week's drop of 17 tototal 921. The total reported Monday is the lowest since the countreached 894 on Aug. 1, and appears to reflect continuing softnessin the crude market, said Baker Hughes economist Ike Kerridge saidMonday.   The number of working rigs a year ago was 1,094.   Baker Hughes' rig count, the widely watched industry index ofdrilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploringfor oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company thatmerged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kepttrack of the number of working rigs since 1940.   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plungedto less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and therig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughesbegan compiling figures.   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.   Among major oil producing states, Oklahoma had 13 fewer workingrigs, followed by Wyoming, nine; Colorado, five; California, four;North Dakota, three; and Ohio, one.   Louisiana was the biggest gainer for the week with an increasein eight working rigs, followed by New Mexico, seven; Texas andKansas, with five each; and Michigan, one. Pennsylvania wasunchanged for the week.</TEXT></DOC>
