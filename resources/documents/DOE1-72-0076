<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-72-0076 </DOCNO><TEXT>Reported are the rates of reaction and activation parameters for CO substitutionreactions of M{sub 3}(CO){sub 12} (M = Fe, Ru, Os) with L (L = PPh{sub3}, P(OPh){sub 3}, AsPh{sub 3}) in the presence of (CH{sub 3}){sub 3}NO.In aprotic solvents the reactions are too fast to follow by conventionalspectroscopy, but the rates decrease with added protonic solvents. Reactionsare readily monitored at room temperature in the mixed solvent CHCl{sub3}-C{sub 2}H{sub 5}OH (V/v, 2:1), and the rates of reaction are inverselyproportional to the concentration of C{sub 2}H{sub 5}OH. It is suggestedthat this is due to hydrogen bonding to give (CH{sub 3}){sub 3}NO...HOC{sub2}H{sub 5}, which is unreactive compared with the very reactive free(CH{sub 3}){sub 3}NO at these reaction conditions. The rates of formationof M{sub 3}(CO){sub 11}L are first-order in concentrations of metal clusterand of (CH{sub 3}){sub 3}NO but zero-order in concentration of L. Thissuggests a mechanism that involves a nucleophilic attack of the O atomof (CH{sub 3}){sub 3}NO on the C atom of a CO, accompanied by oxidationof CO to CO{sub 2}. Since CO{sub 2} is a good leaving group, its departurefrom the metal clusters affords the active intermediates M{sub 3}(CO){sub11}. These then rapidly react with entering ligands to form the monosubstitutedproducts M{sub 3}(CO){sub 11}L. The rates of reaction decrease in theorder F{sub 3}(CO){sub 12} andgt; Ru{sub 3}(CO){sub 12} andgt; Os{sub 3}(CO){sub12}, and an attempt is made to account for the observed relative rates.</TEXT></DOC>
