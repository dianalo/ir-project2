Thelackluster response in financial markets, however, suggestswidespread doubts that policy makers in Washington have aclue about how to sustain a recovery.   Specifically, markets have to be wondering about the delayin reappointing Alan Greenspan as chairman of the FederalReserve. Colin Powell's first term as chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff expires in the autumn, and President Bushannounced his reappointment a month ago. Mr. Greenspan'sfour-year term expires in a month, but Mr. Bush has made noannouncement. Meanwhile, various aides, deputies andkibitzers tell reporters that the delay is an attempt to&quot;leverage&quot; the Fed to ease interest rates further.</LP><TEXT>   This sounds all too much like the same advisers who urgedMr. Bush to raise taxes three months into this recession.Having abandoned their own control over fiscal policy, theseadvisers have since taken to lecturing Mr. Greenspan and theFed on monetary policy. This is graceless at the least, butalso probably dangerous; financial markets can see whenstones are being thrown from glass houses in Washington.   Especially since Mr. Greenspan is the one U.S. officialwho has built some credibility in world markets lately. Amidthe capital's fiscal gridlock, the Fed has had to steer theeconomy with its single monetary oar, and with fair results.The Fed has brought down long-term interest rates, which arethe decisive rates for investment. It's done this withoutreigniting inflation, which except during Paul Volcker's Fedtenure, has been the expectation before every presidentialelection cycle.   It's true that, at 8.5% or so, long-term interest ratesremain stubbornly high. But this isn't something the Fed caneasily control. The Fed in the short run can dictate thefed-funds rate, which is what banks charge each other forovernight loans. And the Greenspan Fed has done this,dropping fed-funds to 5.75% April 30.   But long rates don't always follow in lock-step, sincethey also contain a premium for expected inflation. With goldrising recently past $370 an ounce, inflation apparentlyhasn't vanished. And with the Brady Treasury and Congressboth implying that renewed inflation is the price ofrecovery, Mr. Greenspan's hand on the monetary tiller may bethe only thing preventing a 1970s-like explosion in longrates. The quickest way to kill a recovery would be forPresident Bush to tell the world that Mr. Greenspan has donehis job too well. It would signal that Mr. Bush agrees withhis Fed-bashing economic advisers.   Virtually any replacement at the Fed would now spendmonths trying to persuade markets that he isn't a whollyowned subsidiary of Treasury. This would keep interest rateshigher than they otherwise would be, threatening the economywith sluggish growth or perhaps a &quot;double-dip&quot; recession.Even if Mr. Greenspan is reappointed this week, the gracelessWhite House temporizing on his renomination so far has likelykept rates higher than they should be.   The Greenspan decision is especially important given themany obstacles to a vibrant recovery. Unlike 1983, there areno tax cuts waiting to boost incentives. Instead, marginaltax rates have been rising, both in Washington as a result oflast year's budget deal and in the many states with fiscaldeficits. Regulators continue to put a crimp in new banklending with overzealous oversight, and the Resolution TrustCorp. has become a great socialist overhang on the nation'sreal estate markets. We've long thought -- and Mr. Greenspanhas publicly agreed -- that a capital-gains tax cut wouldprecisely target these problems, but by all evidence the Bushadministration has conceded defeat to George Mitchell'sSenate Democrats.   The U.S. economy is large and resilient, perhaps enough tocompensate for a confused Washington. Despite last year's taxhikes, the marginal rate improvements of the Reagan yearshaven't yet been repealed. Much of the world is discoveringReagan-type free-market reforms. The prospect of a NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement will invite new investment, andtechnology continues to advance at an astonishing pace.   The economy may well recover on its own, but if itdoesn't, we doubt the remedy can be found in sacking AlanGreenspan. That decision would likely sack the recovery too.</TEXT></DOC>
