Furtherexamination on the results in the investigation reports, the survey,and hearing from the scientific personnels were made. Based on the results,it is recommended that the solar dependence of the houses should be ashigh as possible, and an anti-flow to commercial systems, parallel combinedsystem should be adopted. Further, for the apartment buildings, a combinedsystem switchable to the commercial system in which a solar power issupplied to the loads in the department buildings in the daytime shouldbe adopted. Manuals for the practical application were prepared, whichdescribes solar flux data, demand data, calculation method for electricenergy, design examples, and concerned regulations. For standardizingthe system evaluation, the comparative evaluations such as efficienciesof solar energy utilization, power generation, storage and conversion,total efficiency, solar energy dependence, power generation per unitarea, and so forth were set. The advisory committees and forums wereheld, from which useful discussions, advices, and suggestions were obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
