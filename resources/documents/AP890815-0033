Banco de Occidente of Panama, where two managers allegedlyconspired with the Medillin cartel, entered its guilty plea Mondaybefore U.S. District Judge William C. O'Kelley.   The $5 million fine was the largest ever imposed by a federalcourt against a bank for drug-money laundering, said U.S. AttorneyRobert L. Barr Jr. The conviction was the first of its kindinvolving a foreign bank with no U.S. operations.   The guilty plea resulted from a plea bargain between prosecutorsand the bank, which had faced a maximum penalty of fines totaling$10.5 million and forfeiture of an amount equal to assets identifiedas cocaine proceeds.   Canada and Switzerland, which helped in the two-yearinvestigation dubbed Operation Polar Cap, each will receive $1million of the fine, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh announced inWashington. The fine-sharing arrangement was the first of its kind,Thornburgh said.   ``This international cooperation in the war against drugs sends amessage to drug traffickers everywhere that it is going to be harderfor them to hide their ill-gotten profits, and easier for us torecover them,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said.   ``The bank pled guilty because of the activities of two people inone branch office,'' said William Richey of Miami, an attorney forthe bank.   Richey said drug-profit transfers slipped through the bankunnoticed because the bank ``exists to transfer funds. It's a tradebank.''   According to prosecutors, the general manager and a commercialmanager at a Banco de Occidente of Panama branch were bribed bymembers of the Medellin cartel. The Colombian ring reportedlyaccounts for up to 80 percent of the cocaine entering the UnitedStates.   The bank is a subsidiary of Banco de Occidente of Cali, Colombia.   The money was sent out of the United States and ``laundered''through wire transfers, transactions used routinely to exchangelarge sums of money.   To conceal cocaine profits, the money launderers, posing asjewelry dealers, exchanged gold-painted lead bars among themselvesto generate phony gold bullion transactions, Assistant U.S. AttorneyWilmer Parker III said during Monday's hearing.   Parker said informants and undercover U.S. Drug EnforcementAdministration agents posing as money launderers penetrated theMedellin cartel and met several times with its leaders.   ``The significance of this case cannot be overestimated,'' saidBarr. ``We have dealt a significant blow _ certainly not a deathknell, but a significant blow to the ability of the cartel to meetits major problem in this country ... what to do with the vastamounts of cash.''   The bank pleaded guilty to one count of aiding cocainetrafficking through money laundering and to one count of conspiracyto defraud the United States.   Acting under the agreement, the bank on Monday paid by check the$2 million of the fine being split by Canada and Switzerland. Thebank agreed to pay the remaining $3 million over the next four years.   O'Kelley noted that Banco de Occidente of Panama lists a networth of only about $7 million.   He said the fine represented a substantial share of the bank'scapital. ``The court has some question as to the ability of the bankto survive a penalty more severe,'' the judge said.   The general manager, William Guarin, and the commercial manager,Clara Garcia, remain under indictment.   Part of the fine will be applied to a special federal fundallowing the money to be used for prison construction and anti-drugexpenses.   Under legislation enacted in 1986, the United States can seizeproperty owned or under the control of narcotics traffickers evenwhen the actual profits are no longer available for seizure.   ``Moving the assets of illegal drug trafficking out of one bankaccount and into another can no longer cover up the illegal act,''Thornburgh said. ``It is like fingerprints that cannot be brushedaway.''</TEXT></DOC>
