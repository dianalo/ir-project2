Gorbachev and Iranian Parliament SpeakerHashemi Rafsanjani discussed prospects for settling conflicts in theMiddle East and Afghanistan in the first of two meetings between theleaders, Tass said.   The Soviet president on Tuesday warmly greeted Rafsanjani, thehighest Iranian official to visit Moscow since the 1979 Iranianrevolution, and met with him again today.   The official Soviet news agency said Iranian Foreign Minister AliAkbar Velayati was meeting with Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Sovietforeign minister.   Asked about possible arms sales to Iran, military chief of staffGen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev told a news conference that Gorbachev andRafsanjani would be meeting and said any decision would be made by``the political leadership.''   On Tuesday, Gorbachev warmly greeted Rafsanjani to Moscow andpromised that the Kremlin will not damage Tehran's interests.Rafsanjani said Gorbachev's reforms and Iran's strength will helpimprove relations, Tass said.   The Soviet leader said although relations between the neighboringcountries have not always fared well, ``there cannot be and will notbe anything in our policy now that would damage Iran's interests.''   The leaders discussed prospects for settling conflicts in theMiddle East and Afghanistan, and their attitudes toward othercountries, Tass said.   Rafsanjani, who before leaving Tehran recalled that Russianempires always had coveted Iran, was reported to have listed areasof agreement between the two nations. They included universaldisarmament, the question of foreign military in the Indian Ocean, aneutral Afghanistan and national self-determination as areas wherethe two could come very close.   Rafsanjani expressed hope before he left home that the visit willopen ``a new chapter in Iranian-Soviet relations and in the historyof the region,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.   Tass said earlier: ``In the Soviet Union there is confidence thatthe visit by Rafsanjani will give fresh impetus to the continuedprogress of Soviet-Iranian relations ... and will help improvemutual understanding and strengthen cooperation between the twocountries.''   His delegation included Velayati and Mohsen Rezaie, commander ofIran's Revolutionary Guards.   Rafsanjani also is acting commander-in-chief of Iran's armedforces.   Economics Minister Mohammad Javad Iravani preceded Rafsanjani toMoscow to prepare economic and commercial agreements, the Iranianagency reported.   Iran officially has a non-aligned foreign policy, but Rafsanjanisaid earlier this month that the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini hadinstructed him to improve relations with Moscow. Khomeini died onJune 3.   With ties to the West strained, Tehran is looking to the Sovietbloc for help in rebuilding Iran after its eight-year war with Iraq.   Relations between Tehran and Moscow soured soon after the 1979Iranian revolution. That December, Soviet troops deployed to helpthe Afghan government fight Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas, andIran in 1981 repressed the Tudeh Communist Party.   The Soviet Union was one of Iraq's major arms suppliers in theIran-Iraq war, which ended with an August 1988 cease-fire.   Soviet-Iran relations improved when Soviet troops withdrew fromAfghanistan on Feb. 15.</TEXT></DOC>
