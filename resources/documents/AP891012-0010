Wednesday was a day of political triumph and confusion for theBush legislation, which was approved in modified form by the HouseEnergy and Commerce environment subcommittee, 21-0.   Except for an acid rain bill passed by the panel in 1986, thesubcommittee has been deadlocked over clean air measures for adecade while its two most powerful members fought over automobileand utility emissions.   This year, subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif.,champion of strict controls on autos and industry, and Rep. John D.Dingell, D-Mich., a friend of the auto industry, reached anhistoric agreement on auto emissions that ensured action on thelegislation.   The bill intended to clear the skies of urban smog, acid rainand toxic chemicals by the end of the century moves on to the fullEnergy and Commerce Committee _ possibly stopping first at anothersubcommittee for a debate on acid rain.   But just before the subcommittee vote Wednesday, the panel wasthrown into confusion by conflicting, nearly simultaneousstatements from administration officials on Bush's plan for somecars to run on cleaner burning fuels than gasoline.   The Bush clean fuels language was weakened by a 12-10 vote, withthe bill's chief sponsors and most panel Republicans supporting thechange backed by the oil and auto industries.   Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., said White House Chief of Staff JohnSununu expressed the administration's neutrality on the clean fuelsamendment, which eliminated Bush's requirement that automakersbuild a million cars a year to run on alternative fuels.   Lent and Dingell, the chief co-sponsors, backed the change whichenvironmentalists said would weaken the legislation.   But Waxman said he, too, was called about the same time byEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly.According to Waxman, Reilly urged rejection of the amendment.   ``I don't know where the administration is and it may be allover the lot ... on both sides,'' Waxman said. ``It tells a lotabout how they're handling the bill.''   A White House spokesman, Stephen Hart, said after the vote, ``Wesupport the president's proposals on alternative fuels.''   He said Sununu told Lent the administration wanted somethingclose to Bush's language, and suggested changes in the amendment tothat end. Lent never mentioned such changes during debate.   The bill that passed the subcommittee considerably toughenedBush's original auto emissions standards, thanks to the Oct. 3Waxman-Dingell agreement to adopt nationwide California'stoughest-in-the-country auto tailpipe requirements.   But panel members all agreed that there will be more harsh wordsand vigorous debates as the bill advances through Congress. Thereis disagreement over sharing the cost of acid rain reduction, adispute over permitting expansion of coal burning utilities andargument over the severity of controls on chemical plants. Plus,the clean fuels issue is certain to surface again.   The Bush proposal would have required auto companies to build 1million clean-fuel cars a year from 1997 through 2004 in thenation's smoggiest cities. The new language, introduced by Reps.Ralph Hall, D-Texas, and Jack Fields, R-Texas, would only requireauto companies to certify they could build the cars, but thegovernment would not order them built.   Ron Sykes, a lobbyist for General Motors, said the carmakersdidn't like Bush's language because there was no guaranteeconsumers would buy the alternative-fuel vehicles.   The amendment also would define clean fuels as anything thatachieves the same pollution reductions as a mixture of 85 percentmethanol and 15 percent gasoline.   The oil industry contended the Bush plan would give the EPAstrong authority to choose a fuel and that the agency favoredmethanol. The oil industry argued that every clean-burning fuelshould have an equal chance to power America's future cars.</TEXT></DOC>
