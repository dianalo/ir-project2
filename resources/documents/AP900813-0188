One of his former students, a talentedauthor, had committed suicide. His father died and his marriage wasbreaking up.   The book came slowly. It started as a short story called ``TheMean Story,'' and was continously revised. The central character,Dick Pierce, was a cranky Rhode Island fisherman, about 40 yearsold, like the author himself.   When he was finished, nearly 10 years later, Pierce was still apretty difficult fellow, but a little more likable, a middle-agedman with a wife, two kids, a lover and an unfinished boat called``Spartina'' in his back yard.   ``People who are simply good or simply bad are harder to writeabout,'' Casey explained in an interview to promote ``Spartina''which has been released in paperback by Avon Books.   ``It's not the way most of us are. Most of us are pretty badhoping to get better. Sometimes if you can just observe theprocess, the accidents involved in getting better, that's the realpurpose of fiction.   ``There's an enormous grace in nature, as well as a grace topeople.''   He speaks in a voice as rough as saltwater. You can't get muchfurther from the life of a fisherman than the tearoom of aManhattan hotel, but Casey looks as if he just stepped off thedock, his sleeves rolled up, his hair windblown, his face reddenedby the sun.   The author's background seems more suitable to the yachtingcircuit. Casey, born in 1939, is the son of Joseph Edward Casey, aDemocratic Congressman from Massachusetts in the 1930s and '40s. Hewrote poetry in high school and eventually graduated from HarvardLaw School.   Research was unnecessary for ``Spartina.'' He started sailing asa kid, racing boats at summer camp. He and his wife then purchaseda four-acre island in Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island, where Caseylived _ and fished _ for four years.   ``I thought I knew something when I got to Rhode Island,'' saidCasey, who has also written the novel ``An American Romance,'' anda collection of stories, ``Testimony and Demeanor.''   ``Boy, did I learn there was a lot more to it. After four yearsthere, I learned an awful lot of stuff,'' he said.   ``It was the time of my life I was most integrated into theplace I lived. I had to work part time to make ends meet. I hadvery little money, but it didn't matter. I caught fish every day. Ihad a couple of lobster pots, and there were a lot of things to eatalmost all year round.''   Casey writes love scenes like adventures at sea and adventuresat sea like love scenes. Dick's determination to build his ownfishing boat has strained relations with his wife, May, and heeventually turns to Elsie Buttrick, a free-spirited rich-kid, forsupport and affection.   ``She took both his hands, and he floated to his feet,'' Caseywrites of the moment when Dick and Elsie begin their affair. ``Hebumped the corner of the table. When she touched his cheek, theywere clear of the table, in the center of the room.   ``She said several things but he didn't take them in. He feltweightless, but when their bones touched he felt their weightagainst each other, as though they were small boats at sea risingon the same swell, jostling, fendered by their flesh.   ``He had one complete sting of conscience when they driftedapart for an instant. Elsie shoved aside the red curtain and theyfloated through.''   When Dick finally finishes his boat, he stubbornly launchesSpartina despite an oncoming hurricane. He is no longer floating.With the ship being thrown in the air like a parent tossing hischild, Casey describes a man staggering on deck, his onlyfortiication a can of Coke and a thermos of coffee:   ``As he stood back up, Spartina suddenly slid forward as thoughshe were greased. She stuck her nose into a wave. He felt her headheld down, caught, then lifted up by the bow and spun sideways. Heleaned against the spokes of the wheel. No effect. She fell back onher beam. He clung to the wheel post with one hand to keep fromfalling over. For a long moment he had no idea where she was orwhich way was up.''   Casey landed quite smoothly. ``Spartina'' won the National BookAward in 1989, the same year his brother-in-law, Dr. Harold E.Varmus, shared the Nobel Prize in medicine. A professor of Englishliterature at the University of Virginia, he now lives inCharlottesville, Va., with his second wife, Pinchot Pittman, anartist and calligrapher.   And ``Spartina'' is just the first novel of a trilogy, Caseypromises, with other characters telling their stories and theauthor giving them the chance as well to show their natural gracethrough the worst of times.   ``I knew I wanted Dick to become a better person through histroubles,'' Casey said. ``There was a flowering of him. And Elsie,too. She knows she needs to become better in some way. It's anoptimistic story in a way. Both of them become better even thoughthey've been bad.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Aug. 24-26</NOTE></DOC>
