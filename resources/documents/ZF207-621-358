(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Advanced interactive Executive (AIX) is inally available for PS12 users.andP;  Tosucceed, it has to compete withandM;SCO Xenix System V, Interactive 386/ix and OS12.andM;Only PS/2 users with Model 70s or some Model 80s will be able to use IBM'sAIX.andP;  The 486 Power Platform will do nice , too.andP;  The operating systemrequires a 386 chip but, for the moment, the recently launched P70 and theSX-based model 55 are not embraced.andP;  Avail- ability of AIX for PS/2 on thesetwo models will be announced before the end of the year.andP;  Interest in AIX onthe low-powered Model 55 and the P70 will probably be minimal in any case.andM;An important question which harks back to the old 'OS/2 needs PS/2' days iswhether AIX for PS/2 requires an MCA bus or a genuine PS/2.andP;  The word fromIBM is that they have no word.andP;  As far as they know, AIX for PS/2 is justthat, for PS/2 only.andP;  IBM has stated positively, though, that AIX will not besupported on anything else.andP;  Fair enough, but that still doesn't completelyanswer the question.andM;AIX, being a Unix derivative, sits a lot closer to the hardware than DOS oreven OS/2, so if it doesn't work as quickly on any other box there areprobably good reasons.andP;  My personal efforts so far have been restricted to anendorsed model 70-121, but I will report later on whether it is easy toinstall on Compaq ISA boxes as well as various MCA clones.andM;IBM's information vacuum about non-IBM equipment and AIX for PS/2 ends at theserial port.andP;  In a moment of practicality, IBM will support non-IBM ASCIIterminals like the ubiquitous WYSE and TeleVideo screens and keys.andP;  Userswill need to massage the terminal configuration with  stty', and, if they areintent on using the DOS Merge facility, will need terminals capable ofgenerating PC-type key scan codes.andP;  PCs running terminal emulation programs,or even - gasp, horror - a Mac, would work too.andP;  AIX for PS/2 supports up to16 concurrent users.andP;  The operating system needs more than an intel 386 and apower supply to do any substantial work.andP;  While zealous users couldundoubtedly specify a system requiring 1Gb of disk and 16Mb of RAM, theminimum requirements are somewhat iluminating, especially in comparison toOS/2.andP;  You can squeeze the minimum operating system modules and a sin- gleparsimonious application onto a 30Mb drive and, with a minimum of 4Mb of RAM,run a three-user system.andP;  This means that later this year, it win be possibleto use the bottom of the range Model 55 with three cheap dumb terminals, asan effective small business system.andP;  It will also be cost-effective comparedto a lot of other small bore Unix systems.andP;  But, as is often the case withcomputing, bigger and faster usually means better, within the budgetarylimits.andM;At present, PS/2s will only support 16Mb of RAM.andP;  AIX, on the other hand, iscapable of using the entire Giga-space accessible by the 32-bit 386.andP;  WhileOS/2 users have yet to be seen weeping about the inequity of the 16Mb limit,AIX users, by virtue of their multi-user systems, will get to the RAM wall alot quicker.andM;This is not as fatal as trying to run Symphony, Sidekick and network softwarein 640Kb because AIX, being rather clever, can swap virtual memory (on disk)for real memory.andP;  This is slow, but cheap and effective.andP;  However, the moreRAM you have on a busy system, the faster you can go, because RAM-based codeis considerably quicker than the world's fastest hard disk, which IBMcertainly doesn't build into your average PS/2.andM;Another reason why the 16Mb limit is not as constricting as it is with OS/2is that the demand paging ability of the 386 chip is supported.andP;  This allowsexecution of a program without first loading the whole kit into RAM.andP;  Youwon't see this feature on OS/2 until the 386-specific versions come out nextyear.andP;  IBM tape drives are supported, but optical disk drives are not.andP;  Thereare already intelligent I/O cards from Anvil which are supported.andP;  Additionalthird party hardware will be along in due course.andM;With hardware requirements out of the way, the important factor isavailability of both the operating system and software to run on it.andP;  Theoperating system and it's various accessories are available now and, unlikesome previous IBM availability announcements, I have witnessed piles of theshrink-wrapped product.andP;  There are two notable exceptions: the Oracle andIngres database management systems will not be around until later thissummer.andM;The application software situation looks promising.andP;  Little more than sixweeks after the code went  gold', IBM-speak for shippable, AIX is supportedby a handful of prime applications, including Samna's word processor, BrookStreet's Unity integrated package and Tetra accounts.andP;  Promising noises arebeing made about many others, but only time win tell.andP;  Users springing intoAIX system computing may be able to get over the initial application hiccupby relying on one of the three DOS  routes' included with AIX, namely DOSMerge.andP;  Essentially, it's genuine DOS 3.3 running as a task.andP;  This producthas been examined previously in PC  User and little more need be addedregarding its AIX implementation.andP;  Text applications run a treat everywhere,but graphics are restricted to the console, where they have access to abit-mapped screen unimpeded by a serial link.andP;  AIX for PS/2 comes on ninehigh density 32 - inch disks.andP;  There are a further three floppy disks thatperform the installation, but which are not loaded on the hard disk.andP;  Theinstallation is under the control of friendly menus, although an awareness ofwhat is going on is an asset.andP;  A dab hand can allegedly put AIX onto a PS/2disk in about 15 minutes.andP;  it took me about 45 minutes.andP;  The superbdocumentation will be a big help for timorous first-timers.andM;The installation utility asks for some information which it writes to CMOSRAM including keyboard nationality, monitor type, time zone and a name forthe machine.andP;  You then boot into a skeleton system and AIX starts theinstallation.andP;  You can allocate a portion of your disk for DOS but not forOS/2, which is currently at odds with AIX for PS/2.andP;  if you need afl the harddisk for your AIX material, you can still get DOS by booting off the floppydisk.andP;  With a formatted DOS partition a DOS boot can be taken from theinitial menu.andM;Unlike SCO Xenix, AIX won't be much help in setting up your DOS partition.andO;Appropriate use of FDISK is required prior to initiating your AIXinstallation.andP;  Once you have AIX on the disk, installing a DOS partitionrequires back- ing up the disk contents and reinstalling the operatingsystem.andP;  A DOS partition is not strictly required, even for users of DOSMerge, but it can be handy if things go seriously wrong.andM;After eight disk swaps and more menu reading, you're staring at theenormously encouraging AIX prompt: # for the superuser (root), or $ for meremortals.andM;An important consideration for prospective AIX users is device support.andP;  Asshipped, you have a choice of IBM printers, Token Ring, Ethernet adaptors and3270 adaptors and not too much else.andP;  Third party suppliers will, throughnecessity, supply their own device drivers as Anvil has for its multi-VO portcards.andM;The documentation gives instructions on how to tailor the system for anon-IBM printer, but users of modems, fax cards and other expansion busdevices will have to enquire about the kind of AIX support that third partyvendors offer.andP;  For the time being, a lot of them may be saying 'AIX what?'.andM;You're unlikely to install AIX for PS/2 on your existing hardware for lessthan S 1,000.andP;  For DOS, or even OS/2 users, this sounds like a lot of money,but this is a multi-user operating system, after afl, and a thousand poundswill service up to 16 users.andP;  AIX for PS/2 is more expensive than thecompetition, namely SCO Xenix and Interactive's 386/ix.andM;Application software is, of course, extra.andP;  For instance, when available,Ingres' single-user will cost 1,404 pounds, two to eight users will cost12,457 and up to 16 users will be 3,510 pounds.andP;  The more users, the cheaperit becomes.andM;AIX for PS/2 is appalling value if you are a single-user, or if you just haveone terminal hung off your PS/2's serial port.andP;  Open Desktop will outclass itand perhaps OS/2 v1.2 as well when it's ready for shrink-wrapping later thisyear.andP;  I suspect that not too many people will want a multi-user systemsmaller than the current network average of about six users.andP;  That's whereAIX starts delivering value for money.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
