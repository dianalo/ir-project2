(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A weekend convention of a groupthat denies that 6 million Jews were killed by Nazis in World War IIwas moved after a Jewish group pressured two hotels to cancel themeeting.   The Institute for Historical Review had planned a three-dayconvention for 160 members at the Red Lion Inn in Costa Mesa. Afterthat inn and another hotel canceled their reservations, they met ina basement banquet room at the Old World Village Wedding Chapel inHuntington Beach.   ``It took some doing, a lot of fancy dancing,'' Tom Marcellus,the conference organizer, said Sunday. ``The two other hotelschickened out.''   The owner of the wedding chapel, Josef Bischof, was unavailablefor comment Sunday night, said his wife, Delores.   The conference was to conclude today.   ``We're here to bring history into focus,'' Marcellus said.``We're historians.''   The chairman of the Jewish Defense League called institutemembers ``neo-Nazis'' and pledged to follow the group wherever itgoes. On Sunday, the group stood vigil outside the Holiday Inn inCosta Mesa, which decided against playing host to the conventionFriday, two days after the Red Lion Inn bowed out.   ``We've covered every hotel in Orange County to tell them Nazismwill not be accepted here,'' chairman Irv Rubin said. ``We're notgoing to be silent like we did years ago when 6 million Jews werekilled.''   Officials at both hotels made the decisions to cancel theconference arrangements after speaking with opponents of theinstitute.   ``It was in the best interest of everybody,'' said DickHetherington, general manager of the Holiday Inn.</TEXT></DOC>
