Araskog, received in pay lastyear, has tentatively decided to revise the way itcompensates senior executives to more closely tie their payto corporate performance, including the stock price.   The changes, which still face a final vote by ITT'sdirectors, represent an apparent victory for UnitedShareholders Association, a Washington, D.C., group that hadtargeted ITT for a shareholder-rights campaign. The changesare also likely to spur similar moves at other companies,which have been under increasing pressure to hold the line onsoaring executive pay at a time of layoffs and, in somecases, sagging stock performance.</LP><TEXT>   It is understood that an ITT directors' committee hasdeveloped a new compensation system that would affect the payof about 500 top-ranked executives. The proposal has two keyelements: a revised stock-option plan that would limit theability of executives to exercise most options until thestock price had risen at least 25% and a new bonus programlinking cash bonuses to improvements in the company's returnon equity. United Shareholders and the $60 billion CaliforniaPublic Employees Retirement System, known as Calpers, hadexpressed alarm over what they perceived as big disparitiesbetween Mr. Araskog's pay and ITT's performance.   As a protest, Calpers this year voted its 1% holding inITT against the re-election of directors.   While ITT's stock price slipped 18% in 1990 and itsearnings rose 4%, Mr. Araskog's total pay package more thandoubled. The $11.4 million figure comprised salary, bonus andother payments, including $4.2 million in restricted stockthat doesn't fully vest until 1993, as well as $1.4 millionowed Mr. Araskog in 1991 that was paid in 1990 for taxreasons.   The company and Mr. Araskog at the May shareholdersmeeting defended the pay package, asserting that it reflectedhis key role in several asset sales last year as well aslong-term incentive-pay provisions tied to the company'sperformance over the previous three years. Among his variouspositions, Mr. Araskog serves on the board of Dow Jones andamp; Co.   Nonetheless, the tentative changes appear to reflect anacknowledgement that the issue had become a sensitive one forthe industrial, hotel, financial services and forest productscompany.   Asked for comment on the situation, an ITT spokesmanconfirmed that &quot;there have been discussions&quot; with UnitedShareholders &quot;considering the issue of executivecompensation. We're pleased that they've decided to releaseus from their target list.&quot; He added that details of theproposed changes in executive compensation formulas are&quot;still under review by our board of directors.&quot; He saiddisclosing details would be premature.   Ralph Whitworth, president of United Shareholders,confirmed he had met last Friday with Mr. Araskog, praisedthe indicated changes, and said they would &quot;ensure therewouldn't be a repeat of the irrational bonuses that weregranted last year.&quot;   He added, &quot;we're not really interested in dictatingprecise levels of pay or even detailed structures ofcompensation. What we're most interested in is a substantiallink in compensation package to share value.&quot; He alsodeclined to detail the expected changes.   But a person familar with ITT's plans said the new &quot;payfor performance&quot; plan, if approved, would represent asignificant departure from the company's current compensationsystem.   Under the new stock-option plan, ITT would issue optionsat a price at least as high as the stock's fair market valueat the time of the grant, in contrast to the discounts manycompanies offer their executives when issuing options. Inexercising their options, executives would also have to waituntil ITT's stock price had risen at least 25%, or until theyear in which the option expires.   Such changes would effectively reduce prospects for ITTexecutives to make short-term profits from their options.Currently, ITT executives may begin to exercise their options-- and potentially profit from any increase between theoption price and stock price -- just one year after theyreceive them, with the options becoming fully vested afterthree years.   The revised bonus plan would pay cash bonuses linked tothe company's return on equity, a benchmark many shareholdersuse to gauge corporate performance. ITT's nine operatingcompanies would each have separate return-on-equity targetsunder the plan, with executives in each unit being rewardedaccording to how well their operations had met their goals.   ITT's compensation and personnel committee, a panel ofITT's board of directors, reportedly developed the plannedchanges in conjunction with Towers Perrin, a benefitsconsulting firm. Towers Perrin declined to comment on itswork. ITT's executive and policy committee, which includes 11outside directors, has already reviewed the plan. Butdetails, the final version of which would appear in thecompany's 1992 proxy, could change under further review bythe full board.   United Shareholders said it continues to target a total of48 companies for shareholder activism, nine for compensationissues and 39 for a various corporate governance concerns.Last month, the group took Time Warner Inc. off its targetlist after the media giant dropped a controversialanti-takeover plan.</TEXT></DOC>
