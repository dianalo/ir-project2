A new proposal that was rejected would have capped exposureat 0.5 ppM for one hour. The new proposed level was touted as beneficialto asthmatics but would have cost $7 billion over 11 years. Since coal-burningpower plants and smelters are the main source of SO{sub 2}, the EPA investigatedthe number of asthmatics vulnerable to peak exposures near power plantsand concluded that the number was very small.</TEXT></DOC>
