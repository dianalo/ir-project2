For the whole thing! She stayed awake ``for the whole thing.''   There he goes again. George Bush is raising expectations for hisconvention-climax address. It is a pressure situation. He is noWilliam Jennings Bryan, but he'll do OK.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   While Republicans sent a heavy-hitting``truth squad'' to parry Democratic thrusts in Atlanta, there seemsto be only one prominent Democrat here aside from the natives _ andshe feels like ``meat among all the lions.''   As a commentator for ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Rep.Patricia Schroeder's presence is unofficial and her manner isamiable. But the Colorado Democrat is nevertheless getting in a fewzingers.   Schroeder told viewers Tuesday morning that she wanted to``stand up and cheer'' when President Reagan mistakenly toldconvention-goers that ``facts are stupid things'' because ``I'veoften thought a lot of speeches of his ... haven't been exactlyfactual.''</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With fetes and eats and welcoming arms, inhotels and meeting halls and restaurants across thisconvention-consumed city, business is buddying up to the RepublicanParty.

Analysts said the report showed how far the countrystill has to go in solving its trade problems.   The gap between what America exports and what the countryimports surged by 28.5 percent in June, a major setback after threeconsecutive monthly improvements.   The Reagan administration sought to play down the significanceof the one-month surge, but Democratic presidential candidateMichael Dukakis said the figures were evidence of theadministration's failed economic policies.   Financial markets, which went into a tailspin the last time sucha disappointing trade report was released, took Tuesday's reportmore or less in stride.   While the dollar was hit by a wave of panic selling immediatelyafter the report was released, it soon steadied and regained muchof its lost ground.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   This summer's stifling temperatures threatento exact a higher death toll than the 1980 heat wave that killed anestimated 15,000 Americans, an authority on health and theenvironment said Tuesday.   ``This will probably emerge as one of the largest naturaldisasters of this century,'' said W. Moulton Avery, executivedirector of the Center for Environmental Physiology in Washington.   ``If I had in my hand right now the number of people that havedied this summer (from heat) it would be front-page news all overthe country, but I don't have that number,'' Avery said in atelephone interview.   That is because most heat-related deaths go unreported, beingblamed on heart attacks, stroke and other factors, said Avery,whose non-profit center researches the effects of heat and cold onhumans for government agencies and other clients.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   National Science Foundation bases inAntarctica are polluting the pristine polar environment inviolation of U.S. laws and international agreements, theEnvironmental Defense Fund said Tuesday.   ``The environmental practices of the NSF _ the federal agencyresponsible for U.S. scientific research in Antarctica _ would notbe permitted anywhere in the United States,'' the group said in areport.   The findings by the organization, which frequently suespolluters in this country, include disposal of untreated sewage inAntarctic waters, open burning and ocean dumping of other wastesand lack of emissions controls on diesel power generators.   The report said McMurdo Sound, adjacent to the largest U.S.installation, is more polluted than virtually any U.S. waterway andthat highly toxic polychlorinated bi-phenyls and heavy metals arebeing found in the tissues of penguins and seals.</TEXT><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Red Army won't speed up its withdrawal fromAfghanistan because Moslem guerrillas there have rejected politicalovertures and continue fighting the Soviet-backed government, thegovernment said Tuesday.   The statement by Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimovreversed previous official indications that all of the more than100,000 Soviet troops would be home by year's end.   ``The situation in Afghanistan does not give grounds toaccelerate the withdrawal of Soviet troops,'' he told a regularnews briefing.   Gerasimov indicated the Kremlin will stick to the timetable ofthe U.N.-mediated agreement signed April 14 in Geneva.

Dotson had served six years in prison when Cathleen CrowellWebb, now a New Hampshire homemaker, said she had lied whentestifying that Dotson raped her in 1977 when she was a suburbanChicago teen-ager.

The school's debts increased over the last few years and byApril 1987, when it filed for protection from its creditors underChapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, it owed $12.6 million to400 creditors.

Liquidation of the college's assets _ 21 buildings on 400 acres_ will begin as soon as a trustee is appointed.</TEXT><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Radical students staginganti-government protests have been criticized, heckled and evenattacked in recent days by furious citizens demanding an end toviolent clashes in their communities.   Such public anger toward the radicals, who represent about 10percent of South Korea's students, is rarely seen in a nation thathas been generally tolerant of student activism. It has shocked thestudents, who see themselves as fighting on behalf of the verypeople criticizing them.   The rising resentment appears to reflect both anger over theradicals' violent tactics and concern for the Olympics, which startin Seoul on Sept. 17.   South Koreans are worried that violent protests at the momentwhen world attention is focused on Seoul could ruin the nation'simage. Most people see the Games as a coming of age, and they wantto impress the world with a major success.</TEXT><DATELINE>PERQUIN, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   One of the army's two bestbattalions has occupied this mountain town in the heart ofguerrilla country and its men patrol the heights and valleys as achallenge to the rebels.   Nearly 700 men of the Arce Infantry Battalion were brought inJuly 26, by helicopter because truck transport from their garrison35 miles to the south is considered too risky.   Soldiers of the Arce, and those of the Atlacatl battalion, areconsidered the army's most seasoned and efficient fighters.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A homeless, unemployed former factoryworker has kept a vigil for three months on the bandstand in theshadow of the McDonald County Courthouse, saying he's determined toget justice.   But many residents of Pineville, a town of 500 some 30 milessouth of Joplin in extreme southwest Missouri, see 60-year-old TomDaywalt as more ragged exhibitionist than righteous protester.   During Jesse James Days in July, the Chamber of Commerce wrappedthe front and sides of the bandstand in sheets of bright blueplastic to hide Daywalt and then parked a flatbed trailer in frontof it as a replacement stage.   The plastic remains on the bandstand, providing Daywalt someprotection from the sun and rain and allowing passers-by to avoidhis almost courtly ``good afternoon.''</TEXT></DOC>
