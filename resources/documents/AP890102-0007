Theoretically, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulatesthe Sandamp;L industry, expects enough income over the next 30 years _ $45billion to $50 billion _ to cover the cost.   But analysts and many members of Congress say regulators have runup such a huge bill that turning to the taxpayer is inevitable.   ``We still don't know the magnitude of the Sandamp;L crisis,'' SenateRepublican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said Sunday. ``We're not evencertain what the regulators have been doing the past week, runningup a tab of some $40 billion.''   Even with a last-minute spending spree of nearly $6 billion torescue 22 institutions in the final 48 hours of 1988, regulatorsstill have about 350 more insolvency cases to handle. And, as oflast Sept. 30, another 150 savings institutions were sliding towardinsolvency with capital levels below 1.5 percent.   Estimates of the total cost of paying for the mess run as high as$112 billion, a figure reported last month by the General AccountingOffice, Congress' auditing agency.   Treasury Department officials are considering a variety of plansfor the incoming administration. Most attempt to spread out theburden over time and keep as much as possible from adding to thefederal budget deficit.   But Dole, in an interview on ABC-TV's ``This Week With DavidBrinkley,'' said, ``Somebody's going to have to pay. ... We can'thide it by putting it off budget or smoke and mirrors.''   This year's failure and rescue total _ 217 of the 3,100 Sandamp;Lsoperating at the start of the year _ is more than quadruple lastyear's total of 48. It is the highest total since a record 277failures and rescues in the Depression year of 1938.   According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insuresthe nation's 13,500 commercial banks, 221 banks failed or requiredgovernment assistance. That is also a post-Depression record,topping the previous record of 203 in 1987.   Both the FDIC and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.draw their funds from an assessment on member institutions. But theFDIC depends on the much-larger banking industry, which as a wholeis in much better shape, and enters 1989 in relatively good shapewith more than $15 billion in reserves.   FSLIC, however, is technically insolvent. So, regulators havebeen patching together rescue deals with as little cash as possible.Most of the aid takes the form of various commitments secured byrevenue that regulators don't have now and in some case won't havefor as long as 30 years.   Moreover, the revenue projections depend on charging Sandamp;Ls aspecial assessment, originally intended to be phased out in a fewyears, over the next three decades. Industry officials say thatwould drive even more Sandamp;Ls into the red.   The biggest rescue on the last day of 1988 was for the BeverlyHills Savings and Loan Association, a giant California institutionwhose financial problems had plagued regulators for years.   The package called for the government to provide $983 million inassistance in the sale of Beverly Hills to Michigan National Corp.,a bank holding company in Farmington Hills, Mich., that is putting$52 million into the deal.   Also on Saturday, the bank board pledged:   _$243.3 million in aid to Home Federal Savings and Loan, a SanDiego Sandamp;L putting up $25 million to acquire three institutions inthe San Francisco area. They are: Columbus Savings and Loan, SanRafael; Cal America Savings and Loan, Walnut Creek, and FirstSecurity, Pleasant Hill.   _$151.1 million in aid to California Savings and Loan of LosAngeles, which agreed to put up $20.4 million into the insolventBroward Federal Savings and Loan of Sunrise, Fla.   _$29.9 million in aid to First Network Savings Bank of LosAngeles, which agreed to pay $1.25 million for the insolvent TahoeSavings and Loan of South Lake Tahoe.   _$8 million to Home Federal Savings and Loan of Sioux Falls,S.D., which is purchasing United Federal Savings and Loan ofAberdeen, S.D.</TEXT></DOC>
