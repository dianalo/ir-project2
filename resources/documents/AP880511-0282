The government said it did notplan to punish the strikers.   Parliament enacted a law giving the government special powers tospeed its program of economic reform, which inspired more than twoweeks of strikes. The law retained the right of official tradeunions to strike.   Strikers at the Lenin shipyard, where Walesa is an electrician,sought recognition of a local chapter of Solidarity, which wasoutlawed after the declaration of martial law in December 1981.   About 1,000 workers who had occupied the yard without working,the method strikers use in Poland, marching out Tuesday behindWalesa, ending the job action.   Walesa founded Solidarity, the first independent laborfederation in the Soviet bloc, during a summer of labor turmoilthat followed price increases in 1980.   Wednesday was Poland's first strike-free day since April 24. Thelabor unrest, involving six major strikes, was the worst since themartial law crackdown on Solidarity.   A major impetus for the strikes was the reduction or removal ofgovernment subsidies, which increased prices of necessities anaverage of 42 percent in the first three months of 1988. Strikersdemanded pay raises of up to 60 percent, and some were granted.   Premier Zbigniew Messner referred to the strikes, and toprotests at several universities, when he introduced the SpecialPowers Act in Parliament.   He linked the unrest in part to dissatisfaction with the pace ofeconomic reform and declared: ``A decided section of the nation ... displayed a praiseworthy sense of responsibility'' by notstriking.   ``The government knows many groups of the population still livepoorly, but none of the existing conflicts or any of the key socialand economic issues will be resolved by resorting to illegalstrikes,'' Messner said.   Parliament passed the bill 382-0 with two abstentions. It givesthe government the right to take over enterprises or fire managerswho resist attempts to change the economic system. It also lets thegovernment intervene in setting prices and wages.   It did not include a provision in an earlier draft that wouldhave abolished for this year the already limited right of officialunions to strike.   The law is intended to counteract bureaucratic resistance toeconomic reforms, make wages and prices more realistic, reducecentralized controls, increase competition and foster private andmanagerial enterprise.   Walesa, 44, said stopping the strike ``showed our strength aswell as our helplessness.''   Lack of support from the rest of the country hurt the strike,said Walesa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983.   ``At times we were paralyzed because there were so few of us,''he said. ``If there are people who think we lost, it is because westill lack solidarity'' among workers nationwide.   Addressing reporters at St. Brygida's church near the shipyard,he said: ``If necessary we will try again. Nothing ended. Nothingis finished.''   He said the 15-member shipyard strike committee that held fiverounds of negotiations with management would not be dissolved.   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told The Associated Press bytelephone the decision to give up the strike was ``judicious'' and``so eloquent that it requires no comment whatsoever.''   Asked what the government planned to do to the strikers, hesaid: ``I can declare on behalf of the government that our policywill be a positively non-repressive policy.''   Urban said he was making the statement in principle and couldnot guarantee the policy would encompass ``all the possible cases.''   Some shipyard supervisors were back on the job Wednesday andofficials said normal work would resume Thursday. Walesa said hewas telephoned at home and asked why he was not at work and repliedthat he didn't know he was supposed to be.   Referring to his pledge during the strike to be the last toleave the yard, Walesa told the journalists: ``I said I would leaveas the last one. Maybe I will go back as the last one too. MaybeI'll ask for a vacation.''   A commentary by the official news agency PAP said the end of thestrike showed the ``myth about Solidarity's might has fallen,'' butstrike committee chairman Alojzy Szablewski took this view:   ``When the strikers were leaving the yard, I could seeSolidarity's revival.''</TEXT></DOC>
