Day, a maker of rubber and plastic products, has about seven million shares outstanding, giving the proposal an indicated value of $315 million.    As previously reported, Cleveland-based Hanna is proposing the acquisition in an effort to move away from its troubled natural resources businesses and into plastics.    A Day spokesman confirmed that the company on Tuesday received a formal proposal from Hanna to acquire the company. Day said its board also would consider &quot;other alternatives.&quot;    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Day shares rose $1.25, to close at $50.50, indicating that traders believe Hanna may increase its bid. Hanna shares closed at $22.75, up 25 cents, also in Big Board trading.    A Hanna spokesman said the company didn't have any comment about Day's latest action on the proposal.    Separately, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it placed Hanna's double-B-plus senior debt and double-B-minus preferred stock ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. About $80 million of debt is affected. Sandamp;P said that if Hanna's proposed bid for Day is financed with debt, its financial risk would increase significantly. Sandamp;P said that the company's debt could rise to more than 50% from 10% of its total capitalization. &quot;Cash flow also will deteriorate,&quot; Sandamp;P said.    The Hanna spokesman said the company didn't have any comment on the Sandamp;P move. </TEXT></DOC>
