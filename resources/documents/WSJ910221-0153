Kang</HL><DATE>02/21/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A11</SO><LP>   Seoul -- The &quot;madame&quot; twisted his face a little closer,placed one plump hand on my knee and asked, &quot;So now, whatkind of man would you like: handsome and manly or weak andpretty?&quot; After a brief conference, my friend Jean and Idecided to order one handsome and one manly.   The madame returned shortly. &quot;Here's your handsome andhere's your manly,&quot; he said. So much for the attempt atvariety. They both looked weak and pretty, not at all whatwe'd expected at a host bar called &quot;Rocky.&quot; We hadn'tunderstood that we could reject the madam's first choice andwatch other available hosts parade in front of us. Maybe nexttime.</LP><TEXT>   Hostess bars, in which men pay for the privilege ofconversation, and sometimes more, with local beauties, are anestablished form of entertainment in Seoul. But host bars, inwhich women seek the same pleasures from young men, are newhere. Though alarm over women slipping away from hearth andhome for such forbidden delights has inspired a series ofhighly publicized police raids, Seoul now has hundreds ofhost bars, and they are also springing up outside thecapital.   Korean society constricts professional and socialopportunities for women, so the new clubs have become popularmostly with the bored and monied: middle-aged wives, widows,divorcees and mistresses, drawn by brochures distributeddoor-to-door in Seoul's fanciest neighborhoods. Presumablythe clubs miss out on a lucrative afternoon businessservicing housewives, but the threat of being closed downmeans most host bars do not open until midnight, itself aviolation of Korean law.   Hostesses are also said to be regular patrons. Once thesewomen leave work, they love to dish out the same treatmentthat they endure. One salon madam tells of several hostessesmaking their hosts expose themselves. The woman whose hostwas the most well endowed then had to pay for the entiregroup's entertainment.   Determined to explore, for journalism's sake, this newcultural phenomenon, we learned of Rocky's through a friend.When we arrived after midnight, the sign was unlit and ametal grate blocked the entrance. This did not deter us. Wehad both sacrificed a proper night's sleep and Jean hadwashed her hair just in case her host wanted to run hisfingers through it. So we wandered upstairs to find an oldwoman sweeping. On the way down, a man stepped out of theshadows and asked what we were doing. &quot;Nothing,&quot; we said. Theman smiled and asked, &quot;Are you looking for Rocky?&quot; We nodded.With that, the mystery man withdrew a key from his pocket,fumbled with the locks on the grate and admitted us into whata brochure described as a &quot;paradise for women.&quot;   We were led to a large room, decorated in a somewhatconfused style: a cross between rococo and earlycave-dwelling. A chandelier's light revealed walls that werealternately covered with pink paper and textured concrete.Pink Louis Quinze-style sofas were set across two of the fourwalls.   Our madam, dressed in an embroidered gold jacket, pushedus toward the sofas and sat primly next to us to begin theserious business of inquiring into our tastes: food, drinkand men. After bringing over Yang-su (Mr. Handsome) andSang-suk (Mr. Manly), the madam told us to have a good time,and flounced out of the room.   So there we were. The four of us. A few moments of awkwardsilence passed. Then whiskey and fruit arrived, and the twomen immediately prepared drinks and served the food -- anunusual scene in a country where men expect women's lives torevolve around them. Perhaps this explains some of the hostclubs' appeal. At any rate, fortified with a few shots, wesat up straighter and questioned our hosts in &quot;ban mal&quot;, aform of speech usually reserved for children or closefriends.   The two men answered in the more respectful &quot;chon-daemal&quot;. It turns out that Yang-su and Sang-suk, both 25, aretwo of the older men at Rocky, where the average age amongtwo dozen hosts is 22. Dressed conservatively indouble-breasted suits and the ubiquitous white socks, theydiffered from the typical Korean white-collar worker only intheir elaborately coiffed hair and their subservience.   Unlike their female counterparts, who flock in from thecountryside to escape the rigors of farm life, both Yang-suand Sang-suk told us they are city born and bred. They saidthey joined the profession because of the money, addingquickly that they also find the job interesting.   By most accounts, hosts begin working part-time asstudents and are unwilling to part with the wages. They canearn a monthly salary of 50,000 won (about $70) and about 20times that in tips, 2% of which goes to the establishment.New college graduates in Seoul make about 400,000 won a monthin more traditional jobs.   Yang-su has been on Rocky's roster for about six monthsand is jaded by the whole experience. His eyes flickered ininterest momentarily when he learned that he was serving twoKorean-Americans. Previously his only foreign customers hadbeen Japanese tourists on &quot;sightseeing&quot; tours of Rocky.   After a few excited questions about life in the U.S.,Yang-su was bored again. And why should we have expected anydifferent? In his short career, Yang-su has &quot;had every kindof women except a `halmoni' (grandmother).&quot; Not the mostattentive of hosts, he was absent for large chunks of time,&quot;because regular clients were requesting my presence in otherrooms,&quot; or so he said. This would mean that he was inconstant demand, putting him in Group &quot;A&quot; of Rocky'sthree-tier hierarchy. Less-requested B and C hosts commandlower salaries, and, we can assume, smaller tips.   Sang-suk, with just one-month's experience under his belt,still retained some enthusiasm. &quot;The work is enjoyable. Butsome of the women who come here are under a lot of stress andstart hitting us after they've had a few drinks,&quot; he told us.&quot;Sometimes the women become so drunk that they can't go tothe bathroom by themselves.&quot;   Occasionally women ask him out on dates, and during offhours they go to a matinee or a cafe, Sang-suk said. Evasiveabout whether sex is a part of his afternoon dates, Sang-suksaid it is for some hosts. Other host bars have moreclear-cut guidelines on extracurricular activities, he toldus: If a host goes all out for his client, the woman pays200,000 won and the host bar pays 100,000 won.   Sang-suk said he has the most fun playing drinking gameswith a large group of women. He described a few games, suchas one that involves tossing whiskey, food, cigarette buttsand anything else that is handy into an ice bucket for theloser to drink. Jean picked the &quot;apple game,&quot; which had uspassing an apple from mouth to mouth, taking a bite eachtime. We played until the apple was pea-sized and the gamethus became a contact sport. The madam and &quot;sekki&quot; (baby)madam peered periodically into the room to check up on us,join the fun and encourage our hosts to be more aggressive.   At 4:30 the bill was produced. The tab for snacks and twohalf-sized bottles of whiskey came to 280,000 won. The tipfor each host and the madames was 200,000 won, of which50,000 won went to the guitar player. All in all, a night ofcosseting and flattery had cost 480,000 won. At the currentexchange rate, that's about $335 per gal per guy.   ---   Ms. Kang is a businesswoman based in Seoul.</TEXT></DOC>
