Chairman Kent Kresa may havethe toughest job in the defense industry.   While all arms makers are hurting because of the shrinkingPentagon budget, Northrop has the extra burden of shaking animage as the most lawless company in a field of notoriousrule breakers.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Reputation is something that other people give you,&quot; Mr.Kresa says, recognizing the size of his task. It always lagsbehind reality, he says, &quot;good or bad.&quot;   The job isn't getting any easier for the 53-year-oldexecutive. A court in Seoul last month dismissed a civil suitfiled by Northrop alleging the company was swindled by someSouth Korean businessmen. The court found instead thatNorthrop had paid out millions of dollars in an &quot;illegal&quot;effort to influence a South Korean purchase of the company'sF-20 jet fighters. Two U.S. grand juries are examining thematter.   Another investigation is also heating up, one that has yetto become public. A few weeks ago, the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation began trying to determine whether Northrop'slegal department hid or destroyed a letter instructingemployees to purge their files of certain incriminatingdocuments, several people familiar with the inquiry say.   A Northrop spokesman says that the company isn't aware ofany such letter and that &quot;there is nothing to substantiate&quot;the allegations. But the types of documents allegedlyreferred to in the letter -- some of which have surfaced inconnection with a lawsuit and were reviewed by this newspaper-- are themselves revealing.   One, stamped &quot;Northrop Private,&quot; shows internal costestimates for making MX missile parts. At the bottom of thesheet is a curious $10 million line item: &quot;Room for Pad.&quot;Another document suggests the company &quot;conceal&quot; a $6 millionreserve on the MX program, presumably from Pentagon auditors.Yet another notes the creation of a &quot;substantial managementreserve pool,&quot; adding that it too &quot;will be disguised.&quot;   Perhaps of most interest is an analysis of variousalternative accounting methods. One of the methods examined,it noted, had the advantage of being &quot;honest.&quot; Anotherdocument indicates, however, that the honest one wasn't theoption picked.   Northrop declines to comment on the contents of thepapers, which it acknowledges were prepared in theearly-to-mid-1980s. A spokesman says, however, that U.S.authorities had copies of the documents when they ended acriminal investigation into the MX program as part of abroader settlement in February 1990. The Justice Departmentalso had them when it declined in June 1990 to join a relatedcivil suit against Northrop brought by a former employee, MaxKillingsworth.   But the FBI's revived interest in the documentsunderscores just how slow and difficult it will be for Mr.Kresa to exorcise the demons of the past. Moreover, thedeception that the documents seem to reflect suggests that,rather than a cosmetic makeover, Northrop needsreconstructive surgery. Mr. Kresa, who has been chiefexecutive for two stressful years, is the man plying thescalpel.   Stanley Pace, the retired General Dynamics Corp. chairman,who came in to mop up that company's scandal-stained image inthe mid-1980s, says, &quot;I've been very impressed by Kent'sdedication to confront the problem.&quot; Mr. Kresa once soughtout Mr. Pace to chat about improving Northrop's ethicalclimate.   &quot;What Kresa is trying to do is revolutionary,&quot; says TimPettee, a vice president at Alliance Capital Management, amajor Northrop shareholder. He adds that the restructuring atthe company, which in 1990 had sales of $5.49 billion, hasn'tgot the attention that some others in the industry have. ButMr. Pettee says he is convinced that Mr. Kresa has greatlyimproved Northrop's manufacturing operations and is &quot;changingthe whole corporate culture.&quot;   Northrop's longtime critics are less sure. Rep. JohnDingell, the Michigan Democrat whose investigators haveuncovered numerous abuses at Northrop, says it will be &quot;anenormously difficult task for one person&quot; to turn Northroparound.   In a closed-door hearing last year before a House Energyand Commerce subcommittee, headed by Rep. Dingell, Gen.Charles Henry told the panel that senior Pentagon officialshad concluded the company &quot;had serious problems in ethics&quot;and &quot;needed to come up with an action plan of more thanpromises.&quot;   Others point out that Mr. Kresa hasn't completely cut tieswith former Chairman Thomas V. Jones. &quot;I sense a genuinedesire to change some of the destructive policies of thepast, but I'm not convinced anything substantive has yetoccurred,&quot; says Herbert Hafif, a California lawyerrepresenting a number of whistle-blowers, including Mr.Killingsworth, who are suing Northrop for alleged procurementfraud.   In the headiest days, when Northrop was on its way tobecoming an aerospace powerhouse, the maverick Mr. Joneswasn't one to always let legalities stand in his way. In1974, he pleaded guilty to falsifying documents and lying toa grand jury and the FBI about illegal contributions to theNixon presidential campaign. Later, Northrop's board saddledhim with &quot;a heavy share of the responsibility&quot; for Northrop'sinvolvement in a foreign-payoffs scandal in the mid-1970s.   In 1989, the board again censured Mr. Jones for his&quot;management style&quot; in connection with the F-20 sales effortin South Korea. And on the day Mr. Jones announced he wasretiring as chairman, an international arbitrator's decisioncame to light that reached the same conclusion as the Seoulcourt: &quot;Northrop was acting through its highest level ofmanagement in violation of the law&quot; in its effort to sellF-20s abroad. (Mr. Jones didn't return several phone callsseeking comment.)   Such was the legacy inherited by Mr. Kresa, a soft-spokenaeronautical engineer trained at the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology. By the time Northrop pleaded guilty in 1990 tofalsifying test results on a nuclear missile and on anotherweapons program, many in the industry were wondering whetherthe company would ever win another big contract. After itshighly touted aircraft design lost the $60 billion-plusAdvanced Tactical Fighter competition to Lockheed Corp. lastApril, many in the industry cited Northrop's bad name onCapitol Hill as a factor. Mr. Kresa says Lockheed won simplybecause it had the better proposal.   Either way, some lawmakers -- even some defense hawks --still won't vote for Northrop's most crucial project, the B-2Stealth bomber, because of the company's notoriety.   Without criticizing his predecessor, Mr. Kresa has set outto distinguish himself from Mr. Jones, who at 71 is still adirector. For example, while many employees say Mr. Joneslargely gave lip service to training programs, Mr. Kresa putshimself and his senior executives through the paces. Theyhave even attended a &quot;boot camp&quot; on manufacturing processes,at which participants must come up with a plan to soldercircuit boards more efficiently. &quot;Tom Jones never would havegone through this,&quot; says Peggy Jo Fulton, who runs theprogram at Northrop's aircraft division.   Whereas Mr. Jones was a marketer, Mr. Kresa is a manager.Whereas Mr. Jones ran the company with an iron fist, Mr.Kresa seems to welcome ideas and scribbles out replies toemployees at all levels of the company. Whereas Mr. Jones wasa globe-trotter, Mr. Kresa stays close to home, spendingabout 20% of his time with workers in Northrop plants.   With each visit, Mr. Kresa tries to impart a set of sixvalues, which he and other top executives say they took greatpains to put together. They are: delivering customersatisfaction; treating colleagues with respect; regardingsuppliers as &quot;team members&quot;; taking responsibility forquality; demonstrating integrity; and providing leadership.Although many companies have such mission statements -- oftencodifying the obvious -- Northrop never had one before.   Mr. Kresa's visits with employees are fairly casual, butthe talk can turn serious. On a recent day, a middle managerat Northrop's electronics division in Hawthorne, Calif., asksthe chairman what to do when two values collide. &quot;I'veexperienced times where the customer has asked us to dothings that weren't consistent with integrity,&quot; he says. Mr.Kresa's response is unequivocal: &quot;If you don't haveintegrity, you lose everyone's confidence. . . . I can'toverstate the issue of ethics.&quot;   Confronting its misdeeds hasn't been easy for Northrop.Mr. Jones took the view, as he put it, that &quot;it's thehardware that counts,&quot; and that the public should &quot;forget allthe rest.&quot; Even Mr. Kresa, who joined Northrop in 1975,played down the importance of charges of wrongdoing a fewyears ago. He said companies on high-profile Pentagonprograms have to expect to &quot;take the heat.&quot;   Not anymore. Today, mea culpas are being uttered over andover. &quot;There's a sense of urgency at this company,&quot; says ArtDauer, Northrop's senior vice president for human resources.&quot;What we're saying is these things happened, and we don'twant them to happen again.&quot;   Across the corporation, employees are barraged by thatmessage. &quot;Integrity is the one value Northrop can'tcompromise,&quot; a consultant tells line managers at a leadershipseminar. &quot;In the short term, what is the best way to makemoney? Lie, cheat and steal. But what happens in the longterm? You get caught.&quot;   Mr. Kresa says he is determined to minimize the chancesfor that. He has increased the amount of auditing andoversight and set up ethics classes. But mostly, he haspreached to the 36,000 employees that it is everyone'sresponsibility to come forward when problems arise. &quot;Ifeverybody is on guard, you can nip thousands of these minorissues in the bud,&quot; he says. &quot;You don't allow the bad seed togrow.&quot;   In the past, the bad seeds blossomed, partly because whenemployees did speak up with bad news, they were scoldedinstead of rewarded. This shoot-the-messenger syndrome (knowninside Northrop as &quot;kill the briefer&quot;) is one of the thingsMr. Kresa is most determined to change.   Some are heeding the call. Whenever he is about to hectoran employee for pointing out a problem, Northrop VicePresident Brian Boyer dips into his pocket and grabs aheavily creased piece of paper with a few reminders: &quot;I willtreat others as I wish to be treated . . . I will avoidsarcasm, dual meanings and `cheap shots' . . . I willendeavor to be more helpful to others . . . I will be morereceptive to criticism. . . .&quot; The lines provide the 22-yearcompany veteran, who oversees manufacturing at the aircraftdivision, with instant rehabilitative therapy. &quot;We're holdinga mirror up to ourselves,&quot; he says.   To ensure that all managers get feedback, Mr. Kresa hasbegun a procedure in which supervisors are regularlyevaluated by their subordinates. The chairman himself was thefirst to go through the process. And what do his colleaguessay he needs to improve on? &quot;They told me to lighten up,&quot; Mr.Kresa says.   He isn't likely to do that soon. He must pilot Northropthrough the industrywide turbulence set off by defensecutbacks. Earnings have risen, cash flow is strong and debtis declining, but Northrop's revenue and profit willsubstantially shrink if the B-2 program is gutted orcanceled.   Mr. Kresa must also confront the specter of Northrop'ssins in the 1980s. He has already settled lawsuits, agreed tofix a defective weapon and gone before Congress to apologize.But employees say damaging documents, stowed away by managersin what insiders call &quot;Pearl Harbor files,&quot; may crop up atany time.   There is, for example, the letter the FBI is looking fornow. It is said to ask employees to rid their files of papersthat refer to questionable accounting activities.Specifically, according to several people close to thesituation, the government is examining whether Northrop hidsuch a letter from a federal grand jury investigating the MXmissile-contracts case.   Both Northrop and a retired supervisor, under whose namethe letter allegedly was issued, say such a directive neverwent out. &quot;We never instructed people to take stuff out oftheir files,&quot; says Thomas Kornegay, the retired supervisor.   But a former Northrop employee says in an interview thathe was asked by Mr. Kornegay to retrieve the letter inresponse to a grand jury subpoena several years ago. &quot;I madea copy of it and took it to the legal department,&quot; says theformer employee. He says he also recounted these events tothe FBI recently. The FBI won't comment.   Mr. Killingsworth, who brought the civil suit againstNorthrop, says he also saw the letter when he was a companyemployee. And although the Justice Department decided lastyear not to join in his fraud suit against Northrop, itapparently has renewed some interest. Last October, the U.S.attorney's office in Los Angeles sent Mr. Killingsworth'slawyer a letter, saying it &quot;wishes to monitor anydevelopments in this matter that might prompt reconsiderationof the decision&quot; not to help litigate. Howard Daniels, chiefof the office's civil fraud section, declines to elaborate.   Whatever happens, Mr. Kresa says he will keep pushingahead, urging employees to focus on the future -- withoutforgetting the past. &quot;It's been a very painful process,&quot; saysthe chairman. &quot;It's one we don't want to repeat.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
