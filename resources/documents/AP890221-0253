After a lifetime in the spotlight, one brush with death and asecond illness that left her partially paralyzed, Falana, 46, hasturned her back to the entertainment grind that has dominated herpersonal and professional life.   ``I want my life back,'' she said in a recent interview in herapartment overlooking the Las Vegas Strip where she performed formore than two decades. ``The demands of my career had become verydraining, very depressing. I won't lock myself in again so that Ihave no space to dream. I'm not rushing back to that kind of world.''   Falana nearly died in 1983 when she suffered peritonitisfollowing abdominal surgery. In November 1987 she was diagnosed bydoctors in Las Vegas and at UCLA Medical Center as having multiplesclerosis, a neurological disease that short circuits the centralnervous system.   Her sizzling dance routines, a trademark since she wowed Broadwayin ``Golden Boy'' with Sammy Davis Jr. in the 1960s, had beenstilled in the summer of 1987 when she found her strength sapped bythe illness.   She and her long-time manager, Joe Schenk, agree she will neverdance again. And she says she'll never go back to life on the road.She doesn't have the heart or the health.   ``I spent a good part of my life in airports, sleeping on planes.How chic is that?''   She hasn't dismissed the idea of performing in her hometown ofLas Vegas on a limited basis, but wants nothing more to do thehassle of the road.   ``I'm learning to hear my body,'' she says. ``Stress is the mainfactor in all diseases. I need calm. The whole world is hurry up.Well, excuse me, but I don't want to play. I've matured intounderstanding what is important for my health.   ``Since I was 14 I've been on every circuit of nightclub thereis. And if I've missed one, I don't want to see it. What is there todedicate your career to? One more dressing room that you find in thebasement of a building?   ``Whatever triggered this, I'm not going to let it happen to meagain.   ``I just got a second chance to learn how to live,'' she said,her voice rising. ``I'm in charge. When you get a second chance atlife, you'd be amazed at how wide awake you become.   Longtime friends such as Davis, Wayne Newton and Julio Iglesiashave encouraged her to follow her heart, mind her health, but notclose the door on her career.   ``They say, `You can't give up your gift.' But they also tell meit's important that I get well.''   ``In her mind, she doesn't want to perform again,'' Schenk said.``The dancing is gone. She'll never do that again.''   Schenk believes the stenuous dance routines that were a Falanatrademark helped accentuate her problem 15 months ago. Falanabelieves she is totally recovered from the disease.   Her health grew progressively worse in the summer and fall of1987.   ``The last performance I did was the worst I ever did,'' sherecalled of an engagement in Orlando, Fla., in August 1987. ``Icouldn't feel my left foot touch the floor. I had no rhythm in myleft leg. My vocal chords were collapsing. Everything was flat.There was no Lola on stage.   ``I was afraid to stray away from the piano because I needed itfor support. It was a scared person up there. I couldn't switch themike from one hand to the other. I don't even remember the showexcept thinking `How can I get off the stage.'''   By that fall, she was bedridden. She moved to an apartment afterfalling down the stairs at her home. By Nov. 2 the left side of herbody was paralyzed.   ``I couldn't move my arm or leg,'' she recalled.   Determined to lick the paralysis and the gloomy outlook of herdoctors, she said she began climbing small mountains _ proppingherself up on an elbow, grabbing a bed railing to try and sit up.   ``Something inside was telling me, `You're not as helpless as youthink.'''   By the 15th day after her diagnosis she decided to go to ashopping mall.   ``I had a limp, a little drag in my left leg,'' she recalled.``If I walked slowly, it would look like I was just shopping, juststrolling. If someone noticed, I kissed it off by saying I hadstubbed my toe.''   After five months of therapy she was able to raise her left armover her head. Now she wants to spend her time letting others knowthat faith in God can sometimes be a miraculous medicine.   Beneath the pizzazz of show business is a fickle streak thatleaves her cold.   ``I've seen people get every imaginable accolade. But if they getone day older than the world thinks they should be, they drop themlike they have no talent at all,'' she said.   ``Show business is not the master to follow. It does not love youback. It takes what it needs, and if you can get your share out ofit, good for you. If not, too bad, goodbye.   ``Some of the greatest actors and actresses in the world aresitting in a home someplace and can't even get a job to buy foodwith dignity.''   What's ahead for Lola Falana?   ``I'm planning on being healthy, being well, meeting a marvelousgentleman someday, settling down, being his wife.   ``Now that I've seen all the games, all the glitter, all theillusions, I'm ready for the real things in life _ human relations.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for weekend editions, March 3-5</NOTE></DOC>
