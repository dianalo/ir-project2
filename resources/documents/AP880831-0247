The bitter battle concerns which of two groups has thequalifications and impartiality to evaluate anti-virus software forpotential customers. The competition could slow down progress incombating viruses.   ``I personally know most of the people in this industry and Ihave never seen this kind of animosity,'' Brian Camenker, head ofthe PC users group of the Boston Computer Society, said Tuesday.   The battle centers on products _ sometimes known as vaccines _that are intended to deal with viruses, which can wreak havoc withcomputer programs. Viruses are tiny pieces of computer code thatpranksters or other outsiders can secretly put into normalprograms, which ``infect'' computers when used.   Although they are rare and have done limited damage so far,viruses are feared because of their potential to be spread from onecomputer to another, wiping out millions of dollars' worth of datain minutes.   Publicity over viruses such as the Israeli virus, the Christmasvirus and the Pakistani Brain has led dozens of companies andindividuals to create anti-viral software products, but there is noeasy or reliable way for customers to know whether they work.   Customers and producers agree on the need for an independentpanel of experts to review the software. The question splitting theindustry is who should be in charge.   Pitted against each other are the 2-month-old Computer VirusIndustry Association, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., and aloose collection of other computer figures, led by Jon R. David, aconsultant in Tappan, N.Y., and Harold Highland, editor ofComputers andamp; Security magazine in Elmont, N.Y.   The controversy heated up Monday with the publication of afront-page article on the debate in MIS Week, a weekly tradenewspaper.   Each side accuses the other of using sloppy techniques andmanipulating the testing process for its own purposes. Theintensity of the debate has left some software developers disgustedwith the whole business.   ``We're not casting our lot with anyone,'' said Raymond Glath,president of RG Software Systems Inc. in the Philadelphia suburb ofWilow Grove, Pa., who has nonetheless been loosely aligned withDavid and Highland.   An independent testing panel is essential because most computerusers have never seen a virus. If they had a useless defense, theywould not know it until a virus invaded and caused problems.   ``This kind of testing needs to be done professionally andcarefully, particularly if other people are going to place relianceon it,'' said Robert V. Jacobson, president of New York-basedInternational Security Technology Inc.   Jacobson has cautiously thrown his support behind the ComputerVirus Industry Association, which was formed in June by a group ledby John McAfee, president of InterPath Corp. in Santa Clara, Calif.The group has eight corporate members.   The industry association is assembling an independent universitytesting panel composed of people from three New York metropolitanarea colleges: Pace University, Adelphi University and SarahLawrence College.   The head of the university testing program is John Cordani, whoteaches computer science in the business schools of Adelphi andPace. Cordani is a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve and has apart-time post in the computer security division of the Pentagon.   David and Highland say Cordani and the three schools don't seemto have the necessary credentials. They also say McAfee's InterPathproducts will have an advantage in the testing, which has notbegun, because McAfee is the inventor of a virus simulator thatwill be used as one of the testing mechanisms.   Highland is getting money from his magazine's British-basedpublisher, Elsevier Advanced Technology Publications, for his ownreview of a range of anti-viral software, with the help of Davidand various consultants around the world.   But Highland said he is not interested in operating an ongoingsoftware review board: ``At the age of 71, I'd rather sit on thesidelines. I'm having more fun running a magazine.''   The virus issue is crucial enough that a major invitation-onlysymposium on it is scheduled in October by Deloitte Haskins andamp; Sellsand the Information Systems Security Association. Most majorcorporations and government agencies are probing the issue.   For all the controversy over anti-viral products, computersecurity experts agree that the best protection against viruses isnot new software, but prevention. That means being extremelycareful about dangerous practices _ such as loading computers withsoftware that is offered free on computer bulletin boards.</TEXT></DOC>
