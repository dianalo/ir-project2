It looks like our family will be limited to 300 gallons aday and if we must cut back so must this two-year-old multivitamin of a dog.His problem is not in how much water he actually drinks; it's how much hesplatters outside his bowl, when he laps up water like a pelican taking abath.;    &quot;Raider,&quot; I said to him, &quot;we're in the midst of a drought andthere's to be no water wasted.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Peninsula Extra  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TEACHING DOGGONE FACTS OF LIFE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Also ran in EX2/1, EX3/2  </MEMO><TEXT>     According to animal behaviorists, who claim that dogs don't speak English,he most likely heard the following, &quot;Raider, abal shkdh dhklwic wueioasnkwuwoons euoojsk.&quot;;    However, based on his eye contact, I honestly believe heunderstands and will make a concerted effort to abide by water restrictions,which are going to be particularly tough on our family.;    Instead of callingfor a household maximum, water officials should have established a slidingscale that takes into account teen-agers and young adults;    For example, afamily of two adults and two tots could be limited to 300 gallons per day. Afamily with two adults and two teen-agers should be limited to 7,628 gallons aday.;    If you've ever had teen-agers, or ever been one yourself, you knowthat there is an aspect of normal development known in psychology as &quot;TheClean Phase of Life.&quot;;    These teen-age-type persons arise in the morning andshower. They go to school, where they refuse to shower in a public locker roomonly to come home and take another shower. They do homework, eat dinner, domore homework and shower before bed. If they have participated in anafter-school sport they will shower before dinner and may not, at theirteen-age option, shower again until the next morning.;    What is thepossibility that their psyche will suffer from being limited to one shower aday? Will they exclaim such things as, &quot;Hey, Dad! I've got the same last nameas you and if I smell it will reflect on YOUR family name?&quot;;    In allseriousness, we have already made a concerted effort to save water. We havefront and rear lawns devoid of grass; we only wash full loads of clothes,which means that some items which were not previously washed together are nowtub pals.;    That also is why I have a formerly white T-shirt that is nowblush pink and why sometimes my slacks are covered with thousands ofmicroscopic but visible lint balls; we brush our teeth rinsing with a shotglass full of water; we buy drinking water in containers; and this is somewhatpersonal, we don't flush after, shall we say, each primary water closetusage.;    In addition we also use &quot;used&quot; water, also known as &quot;gray water&quot;because it looks like liquid smog, to irrigate plants, which has me convincedthat later this spring we won't get flowers but instead stems and bubbles.;   I would have thought that with all these efforts, there would still be enoughwater for the cleanest kids in the county. However, cutting the kids to oneshower per day, we're still somewhere around 10 to 15 gallons a day over whatappears to be our allotment.;    Which brings me back to the dog as possiblyour last hope at conserving. We taught him how to sit, to lie down, to go tohis mat, and to stay in one place all on command. I wonder if I couldn't teachhim to drink from a glass.;    Pardon me a minute while I experiment.;   &quot;Raider, open your mouth and take a drink,&quot; I said to him while holding aglass full of water in front of his nose, but he didn't respond. Maybe hewasn't thirsty or maybe he's still concentrating on &quot;Raider, abal shkdhdhklwic wueioasnk wuwoons euoojsk.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Owen Whetzel column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910306  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  660  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 6, 199100066312,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
