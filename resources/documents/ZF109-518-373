it also restores the data signal as it forwards thepacket, filters 12,000 packets per second and forwards 10,000 per second; theself-learning feature means that once it is activated, it automaticallygathers Ethernet address information and stores it in an internal routingtable; it may not be getting a launch until Comdex but it's shipping now andcosts $1,600.andM;- o -andM;Campbell, California-based Touch Communications Inc has licensed its Allianceopen systems interconnection protocols to Gandalf Technologies Inc for use inits routing, bridging and other communication equipment; no financialdetails.andM;- o -andM;Farallon Computing Inc, Emeryville, California reckons that there are so manydifferent versions of the Macintosh out there that Apple Computer Inc hascreated a business opportunity by leaving someone else to solve the problemof distributing documents between disparate Macs: according to MicrobytesDaily, Farallon's DiskPaper is designed to solve the problem that some Macssupport colour, some not, different Macs have different fonts and so forth -it enables users of networked Macs to view, copy, and print a documentregardless of type of Mac, colour capability, application, or fontavailability, because a DiskPaper file contains multiple representations of adocument, including QuickDraw, PostScript, or bit-mapped image, and it sendsthe appropriate representation to the receiver's Mac; it is scheduled to shipin the &quot;late fourth quarter&quot; of this year, and will cost $150.andM;- o -andM;Intel Corp has cut prices on the 82586, an 8/16 bit Ethernet controller, usedprimarily in local area net adapter cards: 10Base-T components -transceivers, repeaters and media attachment units - have also been reduced,by around 40%; Intel says the reductions are the result of high-volume growthin the data communications market.andM;- o -andM;Following the Intelsat decision to integrate 10 Latin American and Caribbeancountries into the PAS-1 system, Pan American Satellite's Alpha Lyracom SpaceCommunications has announced a raft of international digital service dataagreements to link companies via its private satellite system; contractsinclude linking Citibank Latino's Florida data centre with regional branchesin Haiti, Trinidad, Jamaica and Panama, and Boeing Telecommunications linkwith NASA's international observatory in Chile; recent agreements in otherparts of the world include a deal with the Volvo Heavy Truck Corp linkingSweden and the US - Volvo will be using the link for CAD/CAMvideoconferencing, data transfers, private voice and facsimile transmission.andM;- o -andM;Inmos Ltd, the Bristol-based subsidiary of SGS-Thomson MicroelectronicsGroup, has a new interface Transputer module which allows Transputer networksto connect to a range of peripherals via the SCSI bus; the IMS B422 SCSI TRAMis a local input-output bus which can operate at up to 4Mb per second andenables Transputer-based systems to communicate with up to seven SCSI deviceson a single bus; it consists of a 20MHz T222 16-bit Transputer and 64Kb oftwo-cycle SRAM on a module the size of a credit card; four standard 20Mbitsper second links allow direct SCSI bus connection to larger networks, and anintelligent interface device implements the connection to the SCSI bus whichallows common SCSI sequences to proceed without intervention from the T222Transputer.andM;- o -andM;Thorn EMI Software TECS has added a new application to its Pilot ExecutiveInformation System: Impact is claimed to monitor short-term issues andsupplement meetings and phone-calls; assignments specify the type ofinformation required and how frequently it should be updated, the Impactscreen displays the status of various issues; Impact is integrated into Pilotand the Pilot database, and reports can also be uploaded from a wordprocessor, electronic mail system or other sources; the company says that thePilot architecture enables it to operate in an environment of IBM mainframes,PS/2s, Macintoshes, DEC and Hewlett-Packard equipment.andM;- o -andM;RHM Computing Ltd is offering a new service called Software Scaffolding whichis targeted at System 36 users migrating to the AS/400: the Harlow,Essex-based company says it will assume responsibility for System 36 softwaresupport while users concentrate their efforts on the AS/400; the company saysthat financial factors often demand that users run the dual environment for anumber of years, but existing staff need to acquire AS/400 skills as quicklyas possible, and it would be advantageous to hand over System 36 support to athird party; the hardware will remain on-site and be operated by the residentstaff, but copies of the program would run on RHM's in-house machines foramendments and updates.andM;- o -andM;The Congleton, Cheshire-based systems integration company, Boldon James Ltd,and ICL software house, Gresham Ltd, have developed a new product calledSabre-Windows DDS; it enables users of MS-DOS operated personal computers toaccess and communicate with ICL's VME mainframe-based Data Dictionary Systemwithin a Microsoft Windows-type environment; the product combines Gresham'sDDS/Server, which enables any computer networked to an ICL mainframe toaccess DDS-held information, with Boldon-James' Sabre-Windows personalcomputer to ICL mainframe system; it uses the Dynamic Data Exchange tointerface with the DDS/Server; information in the Data Dictionary can beaccessed by the personal computer and incorporated into Windows-basedapplications; no costs, but Sabre-Windows will be available early year.andM;- o -andM;Poqet Computer Ltd has signed an agreement with Colchester-based TMITechnology Ltd that enables TMI to resell the Poqet personal computer as theportable vehicle for its Key Results diary software package: the software isto be available on a standard credit card-sized device that slips into thePoqet which has two slots for applications software;
