Application of the equation Rate= kappa(1-Omega)/sup n/ to descriptions of aragonite dissolution ratesis appropriate at constant pressure, temperature and salinity. The authorsmeasurements in sea water at 5{sup 0}C are consistent with the estimate- {Delta} V = 36.5 cm{sup 3}/mole for the volume change accompanyingaragonite dissolution. This result is somewhat higher than laboratoryestimates, but lower than estimates based on calcite and the differencebetween calcite and aragonite molar volumes.</TEXT></DOC>
