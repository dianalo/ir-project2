REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vice President Salvador Laurel onSaturday accused President Corazon Aquino's government ofcorruption and incompetence and urged her to resign and call newelections.   In a four-page letter to the president, Laurel said conditionsin the Philippines had gone ``from bad to worse'' since Mrs. Aquinowas swept to power in the 1986 civilian-military revolt that oustedPresident Ferdinand Marcos. He said Mrs. Aquino failed to curbcorruption or stem the 19-year communist rebellion.   Laurel said that if Mrs. Aquino resigned, he would step downtoo. But he said that if she refused to quit, he would leave hercoalition government while remaining vice president, an electedpost.   Mrs. Aquino refused to comment on Laurel's resignation call, butaccused her vice president of withholding support for her duringtwo major coup attempts.   Last September, Laurel, 59, quit as foreign secretary andrefused to serve in the Cabinet, citing ``fundamental differences''with Mrs. Aquino.   Since then, the vice president's political base has erodedsteadily. Twenty-one of the 22 members of his party in the House ofRepresentatives are reportedly preparing to defect to pro-Aquinoparties.   Laurel read his letter to reporters at a news conference:   ``Madame President: The time has come to tell our people withhumility and candor that the presidency itself is the problem _because the task requires a higher level of competence _ in theface of the advancing communist insurgency, the breakdown of lawand order, the resurgence of widespread corruption, theparalyzation of political will and the growing desperation of ourpeople.   ``We need a leadership that does not only preach boldly, butsternly and courageously enforces public order and public morality... without regard to the toll levied upon one's popularity,''Laurel said. ``That leadership you have promised, but have failedto deliver to our people.''   The next presidential elections are slated for May 1992.   Laurel's election call generated little support among politicalleaders.   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, the country's chief opposition figure,said he would meet Laurel soon to forge a new alliance. But hestopped short of endorsing another election.   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, who has criticized some of Mrs. Aquino'spolicies, said he opposed Laurel's demand. ``While the presidenthas her deficiencies ... her stepping down will not solve ourproblems and may even compound them,'' he said.   Sen. Edgardo Angara, a conservative member of the Aquinocoalition, said the country needs unity, not new elections.   Laurel, a boyhood friend of Mrs. Aquino's late husband BenignoAquino Jr., accused the president of ignoring his advice and ofbreaking a promise to name him prime minister.   Mrs. Aquino appointed Laurel prime minister in 1986 butabolished the post soon afterward.   Mrs. Aquino told reporters Saturday that Laurel's influence haddeclined since she took office, but she said Laurel himself was toblame.   ``I would just like him to understand that when I need hissupport, it seems he is not prepared to give it,'' she said.   In a November 1986 coup attempt, Aquino said, Laurel was playinggolf. She said that in an August 1987 coup attempt in which atleast 53 people were killed, Laurel withheld a public statement ofsupport until military rebels were defeated.   Laurel, scion of one of the country's most influential families,announced his candidacy for president in the February 1986 electionagainst Marcos. He withdrew and agreed to run for vice presidentafter the Roman Catholic hierarchy and others told him only Mrs.Aquino could unite the factious opposition.   Mrs. Aquino ran under Laurel's UNIDO banner. Marcos claimedvictory in the balloting but fled into exile in Hawaii after theuprising.   Some of Mrs. Aquino's supporters also say her government lacksdirection and leadership.   Last month, the man who persuaded Mrs. Aquino to run forpresident, newspaper publisher Joacquin Roces, said the governmenthad lost sight of its goals of justice and social reform.   Solicitor-General Francisco Chavez has charged rampantcorruption within the Presidential Commission on Good Government,which Mrs. Aquino organized to recover the billions of dollarsMarcos allegedly stole in office.   On Thursday, Mrs. Aquino fired her national food director afteran investigation found irregularities in his department but clearedhim of wrongdoing.   Communist rebels have expanded to most of the country's 73provinces, and urban guerrillas and right-wing death squads carryout street assassinations in Manila and other major cities.</TEXT></DOC>
