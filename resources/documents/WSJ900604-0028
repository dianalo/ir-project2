With reserves estimated by Soviet officials at more than25 billion barrels, the Tengiz field is &quot;probably the singlelargest field discovered in the last decade,&quot; said RichardMatzke, president of Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc., theunit of San Francisco-based Chevron that's engaged in thetalks with the Soviets. The reserves are roughlytwo-and-a-half times those of Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, whichaccounts for 20% of U.S. oil output.</LP><TEXT>   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, speaking at a newsconference in Washington, lauded the agreement with Chevron,calling it one of several &quot;important decisions&quot; onU.S.-Soviet economic cooperation reached in connection withhis summit meeting with President Bush. He said the agreementwill produce an investment of about 10 billion rubles in theSoviet Union.   &quot;I think that this economic area and other areas create agood foundation for our political dialogue and create a kindof solid support, a solid pillar of support for ourcooperation,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev said.   Chevron's accord, signed Saturday at the Soviet Embassy inWashington, came just one day after the signing of thelandmark trade agreement between the U.S. and Soviet Union.&quot;This fits right in with the mood of the season,&quot; Mr. Matzkesaid. Though the trade agreement wasn't the linchpin inChevron's agreement, Mr. Matzke acknowleged that &quot;it suredidn't hurt any.&quot;   Mr. Matzke said Chevron comes to the table with oil-fieldtechnology that the Soviets need, international marketingexperience, and &quot;capital at a time when capital meanssomething to them.&quot;   Just last month, the Soviets signed an oil exploration andproduction agreement with Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine,the French oil company, giving Elf exploration rights onbetween 13,500 and 15,500 square miles in the Volga-Caspianregion of the Soviet Union. Until recently, the Soviet Unionhad restricted foreign oil company participation to technicalassistance. But the government now acknowledges its oilindustry is having problems and needs outside assistance. TheSoviet Union is the world's largest oil producer, with justunder 12 million barrels a day, but oil production has beendeclining.   The so-called &quot;protocol of intentions&quot; between Chevron andthe Soviets is only the first step in lengthy negotiationsthat may culminate in a joint venture for production anddevelopment of the Tengiz field, as well as the much smallerKorolev field nearby. A feasibility study and relatedjoint-venture documents for development of the smaller fieldalready have been compiled, though the study results haven'tbeen disclosed. There are currently no commercial drilling orrefining activities in either field.   Chevron will send about 20 employees in the nextmonth-and-a-half for on-site evaluations of the Tengiz field.By the end of the year, &quot;we will make a development proposalspelling out what we would like as an interest in the field,&quot;Mr. Matzke said.   While the protocol is far from a guarantee of ajoint-venture agreement, Mr. Matzke said it &quot;does give us areasonably exclusive right to pursue&quot; a joint venture withTengizneftegaz, the Soviet oil firm, which would serve asChevron's partner. The proposed project, called Sov-Chevroil,would involve exploration and production activities over8,900-square-miles in the northeast Caspian Sea region.   The talks between Chevron and the Soviets were facilitatedby the American Trade Consortium, a group formed in early1988 by American companies looking to pursue joint venturesin the Soviet Union through the Soviet Foreign EconomicConsortium. In March, 1989, the two organizations signed ageneral trade agreement and have since been negotiating about25 potential joint ventures. Other companies in the Americanconsortium include the agricultural companyArcher-Daniels-Midland Co., photography-products companyEastman Kodak Co., consumer-products maker Johnson andamp; Johnson,and food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco Inc.   On Saturday, the American and Soviet consortiums agreed toform a new committee in the Soviet Union to develop andimplement a so-called &quot;accelerated economic developmentprogram&quot; that would create additional joint ventures toproduce consumer goods, medical equipment, and &quot;otherprojects of mutual interest,&quot; and work to modernize theSoviet food, agribusiness, health care, and oil-fieldequipment industries.   ---   Gerald F.
