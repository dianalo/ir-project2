The Maine Democrat had asked the Senate panel to examine whycongressional investigators never saw the six previously undisclosedWhite House memos when copies surfaced during the trial of formernational security aide Oliver North.   In a 51-page report Friday, the intelligence panel said the WhiteHouse sometimes handled documents in chaotic and haphazard mannerwhen Congress sought them for its Iran-Contra hearings two yearsago. But the committee said there was no evidence of a calculatedcover-up by the Reagan administration.   Among those documents was a Feb. 19, 1985 memo to formerPresident Reagan from then-National Security Adviser RobertMcFarlane.   The memo recommended that Reagan write Honduran President RobertoSuazo to reaffirm U.S. support for Contra rebels in Nicaragua andpledge U.S. help in defending Honduras if Nicaraguan troops crossedits border.   Located in an informal ``heads of state'' file in a box of papersat Reagan's presidential library in California, the documentsuggested a ``quid pro quo'' arrangement with Honduras that has beendenied by President Bush. At the time, Congress had banned directU.S. aid to the Contras.   ``Obviously, there are loose ends,'' Mitchell said Sunday in aninterview on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''   ``Not every single question has been answered and every one maynot be answered,'' said Mitchell, who served on the specialIran-Contra investigating committee. ``But there comes a question ofbalance in terms of whether one should or should not reopen theinvestigation.''   Mitchell said more about Reagan's role in the funneling ofproceeds from arms sales to Iran to the Contras will likely surfaceduring the upcoming trials of John Poindexter, who succeededMcFarlane as national security adviser, and former Air Force Gen.Richard Secord.</TEXT></DOC>
