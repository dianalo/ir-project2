Yang Zhenhuai, head of the Water Resources Ministry, said floodsand torrential rain killed 544 people this year, and a droughtscorching wide areas of central and southern China threatens to beone of the worst since the Communists came to power in 1949, theChina Daily reported today.   Yang said 27.9 million acres of farmland were affected by thedrought, and 15.3 million acres had been flooded.   The Civil Affairs Ministry this week said 65.8 million acres hadbeen affected by drought and 24.7 million acres hit by flooding.   China has about 296 million acres of arable land.   Yang said 2.2 million people in the interior provinces of Hubeiand Anhui are having difficulty getting water to drink. In coastalJiangsu province, 5 million people have been mobilized to expandcanals and irrigation systems.   ``It's bad that the drought is hitting the country's major grainproducers at the key season for crop growing,'' he said.   He said irrigation is difficult because many rivers andreservoirs are drying up. The Yellow River had hardly any flow overa 10-day period earlier this month and water in the Yangtze Riveris down about 20 percent, he said.   The drought has been accompanied by searing temperatures in theYangtze River area, and the heat has caused nearly 500 reportedheat-related deaths in major cities.   Official reports said Shanghai is running out of chemicalsneeded to purify its water supply. In Hubei's provincial capital ofWuhan, one-third of the city's 3 million people are not assured ofgetting their daily minimum of 55 pounds of water.   Floods mainly affected Fujian province and other areas ofsoutheast China earlier this spring. But Typhoon Warren killed 20in southern Guangdong province last week, and the official XinhuaNews Agency reported Friday that heavy rains have destroyed 14,000homes near the northeast China city of Qiqihar.   Yang said 10,600 more houses were destroyed in recent rainstormsin coastal Shandong province.   He said northeastern China can expect more rain as the region'srainy season approaches, and people in the north who have just beenrelieved of drought are now preparing for floods.</TEXT></DOC>
