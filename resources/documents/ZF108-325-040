On March 19th,Apple Computer rolled out the latest, and hottest, member of its Macintoshfamily.andP;  The Macintosh IIfx is a 68030 based system running at a clockspeedof 40 Megahertz.andP;  The big news, however, is not just the clock speed, but thefact that the balance of the machine has also been designed and optimized toprovide an incredibly fast and efficient system.andM;Housed in the larger of the two Model II cases (the one used by the II andthe IIX), this computer has been designed from the ground up to be fast.andO;Apple started with the 68030 at 40 MHz, added a 68882 floating-point mathco-processor also running at 40 MHz, added 32K of zero wait state RAM cache,provided two dedicated ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) forthe input/output (I/O) functions, and made the SCSI bus (Small ComputerSystem Interface) into a SCSI/DMA (Direct Memory Channel) bus.andM;Apple spent a lot of time and effort engineering this machine.andP;  It shows fromthe first time you turn it on, and it really shows when you compare it to thelikes of a Compaq Deskpro 386 running at 33 MHz.andP;  It was not Apple's stateddesire to go head-to-head in the clock speed wars, but rather to use the highclock speed to optimize the entire machine to gain the last ounce of powerand speed that it could muster.andM;The SpecificationsandM;The system will allow 4 or 8 Megabytes of RAM on the motherboard and has sixfull NuBus expansion slots plus a new Processor Direct Slot (PDS) for addingin third party processors.andP;  The unit comes complete with the, by now,standard Apple 3.5 inch Superdrive floppy which reads and writes all of theMacintosh formats as well as the IBM world's formats.andP;  A second floppy can beadded and the hard disk choices include both a 3.5 inch and 5 1/4 inch harddrive giving options of up to 160 Megs.andP;  Apple is offering twoconfigurations, an 80 MB version and a 160 MB version.andP;  The IIfx has thestandard array of ports: Two serial, two Apple Desktop Bus, one SCSI, and onesound port.andM;Under the HoodandM;To really appreciate this system you have to get under the hood and see howthe Apple enginering staff accomplished the speed and performance side of thedesign.andP;  First, of course, is the Motorola 68030 running at a clock speed of40 MHz.andP;  The address bus is 32-bits wide, permitting a total RAM addressingcapability of up to 4 gigabytes.andP;  Next, Apple uses 256-byte, on- chip dataand instruction caches to provide higher performance levels.andP;  The built inPMMU supports virtual, shared, and protected memory in operating systems suchas A/UX (see below) which have been designed for it.andP;  Apple also uses atechnique known as burst mode RAM access which enables groups of instructionsand data to be read in fewer clock cycles than in normal access mode.andM;The 68882 Math co-processor is matched at the 40 MHz clock speed for optimumperformance, and an optional parity DRA and parity controller can be added ifdesired.andP;  The IIfx includes a 512KROMSIMM socket so that future upgrades tothe system can be accomplished easily.andP;  The cooling fan is of variable speeddesign and runs very quietly.andM;The memory sub-system has been designed from the ground up to provide fastread and write access for the CPU.andP;  The 32K of Static RAM, which is anintegral part of the memory system, permits overlapping reads from theCache/ROM and writes to DRAM.andP;  The 4 or 8 megabytes of DRAM is composed of80-nanosecond, fast-page, 1 Megabit SIMMS.andM;I/O ASICsandM;Perhaps the most important part of the IIfx is the inclusion of the two I/OASICs.andP;  These specially designed chips control all of the input and outputlow level tasks associated with the floppy disk drives, Apple Desktop Bus,and the Serial Ports.andP;  These ASICs are really Apple IIe's on a single chip(makes you wonder about a Mac/IIe combination doesnht it?).andP;  The only desktopcomputer presently on the market to use separate I/O processors is the NeXtsystem.andP;  By off-loading most of the I/O functions from the main CPU, moreclock cycles are available for CPU intensive tasks and the system can beprocessing data while the I/O channels are being utilized for data retrievaland storage.andP;  If you then add the video cards which provide yet anotherseparate processor, you have a system which has three co-processors, off-loading many of the time-intensive tasks normally handled by the mainprocessor.andM;But What of the Cost?andM;The Apple IIfx is not, as you might imagine, a cheap machine.andP;  Apple hastaken some heat over the years for their pricing, yet they have done verywell in the business marketplace and, with this entry, will be able to gohead to head with the 1486 PC offerings from the likes of IBM and Compaq, aswell as to begin to encroach on the territory held by the RISC systems suchas the SUN and Hewlett-Packard Work Stations.andM;The IIfx is being sold in three configurations.andP;  The first is a floppy onlyversion with 4 megabytes of RAM, the second is a 4 MB system with an 80 MBhard drive and the third is a 4 MB system with a 160 MB drive (other versionsinclude systems with A/UX and optional parity support).andP;  The price for eachof these is as follows.andM;The M5510LL/A, floppy only CPU has a list price of $8969., while ModelM5515LL/A which is the 4 MB with 80 MB hard drive lists for $9869., and theM5520LL/A, the 4 MB with 160 MB hard drive, has a list price of $10969.andO;Don't forget that these prices do not include a keyboard or monitor but doinclude the operating system (System 6.0.5).andM;To come up with final configuration prices, we added the Apple ExtendedKeyboard II, the Macintosh display card 4 .andP;  8, and the AppleColor 13 inchRGB monitor.andP;  We did not price in such options as modems or network cards.andO;We also did not price the basic floppy only unit since it is not likely thatan end-user would ever purchase this system.andP;  Instead, we believe that thissystem is the VAD/VAR and dealer version which will find its way to theend-user complete with someone else's peripherals installed, and which willprovide this same group of resellers with the ability to get units placed atfar better end-user prices than those offered by Apple for the hard-drivemodels.andM;Fully configured Apple IIfx system with 80 MB Hard Drive: $10444 Fullyconfigured Apple IIfx system with 160 MB Hard Drive: $11554.andM;Comparing the ProductsandM;There is no doubt that Apple has unleashed a system which will challenge notonly the high-end of the Intel market, both 1386- and i486-based systems, butalso the Sun and Hewlett-Packard workstations as well.andP;  This product shouldalso appeal to the power users within the PC community, the really seriousgraphics and desktop publishing user, and the engineering workstationmarketplace.andP;  When you add the factor that Apple is also providing a versionwith Unix, known as A/UX, and has also announced support for X-Windows (seebelow), this is a machine which should find its way onto many different typesof deaktops.andP;  While some within the industry may contend that the i486systems as well as the RISC systems recently introduced by IBM,Hewlett-Packard and others, was the first round of the blurring of the PCwith the workstation, I would maintain that it is, in fact, the IIfx whichshould carry that distinction for one reason and one reason only.andP;  All of theother systems previously announced were hardware only with operating systemslaid on top of them.andP;  The Macintosh is truly both a hardware and softwaresolution, being designed from the ground up with the operating system as anintegral part of the system.andM;I do not mean for a moment that SUN and Hewlett-Packard should pack up and gohome.andP;  But this product certainly changes the low end of the workstationmarketplace.andP;  It is interesting to note that Apple provided us all with acomparison chart at the announcement.andP;  Included in this comparison were someinteresting products.andP;  They started with the IBM PS/2 Model 70 486/25, theCompaq DeskPro 486/25, followed by the Compaq DeskPro 386/33 and the NeXtsystem (interesting?), and ending up with the Sun SPARC Station 1.andM;Some interesting things can be concluded from this comparison.andP;  First, theonly systems in which the operating system are included are the NeXt, theSun, and the Macintosh.andP;  Next, (no not NeXt, but next), only the NeXt and theIIfx include separate I/O processing, and only the NeXt and the IIfx includesound as standard.andP;  Interestingly, only the NeXt system does not include RAMcache.andM;Apple does not include a price comparison, partially, I image, since it wouldbe hard to find common video standards between all of these systems, andCompaq, IBM, and Apple offer a multiplicity of graphics options.andP;  After wehave had a chance to review the prices from both Apple and the IBM productannuncements we will provide a price comparision in our next issue.andM;The Apple IIfx:andM;Final CommentsandM;It is really hard to sum-up this product.andP;  I was very impressed, once again,with the engineering skill of the Apple staff and of the &quot;fine tuning&quot;provided in the system.andP;  I am also not sure exactly where this system fits inthe overall scheme of things.andP;  Is it a power-users' Macintosh?andP;  Is it a poorman's workstation?andP;  Is it a combintion of both?andP;  I do know that for someoneinvolved in desktop publishing, using lots of graphics, and working with longand involved documents, this is a must have product for me.andP;  Will I make anypredictions as to how many they will sell?andP;  No!andP;  It obviously will depend onhow the product is marketed by resellers, VARs, etc.andP;  Also, Apple is makingthe IIfx available as an upgrade for II and IIX users so that companies mightelect to upgrade these systems rather than to buy new ones.andM;I do believe that Apple will do very, very well with this box.andP;  There is nodoubt in my mind that they have extended their list of competitors to includethe workstation vendors, at least on the low-end of that product category,and perhaps up into the middle of it.andP;  Well done Apple!andM;The IIfx Upgrade PathandM;As mentioned above, Apple has, once again, provided an upgrade path for itsusers.andP;  This time they are making the IIfx board available for those who havethe II or the IIX (only because of the case size required).andP;  The price forthis upgrade is $2999.andP;  (excluding DRAM).andP;  Apple has been the only company toprovide this type of upgrade path in the PC marketplace in the past.andP;  Withthe advent of the plug-in i486 processors, companies such as IBM and AST havestarted to provide this in the Intel world.andP;  The idea is a great one, topermit existing customers to take advantage of the latest in technology andcomputing power.andP;  However, I wonder how many IIfx systems Apple will not sellbecause companies elect to upgrade?andP;  If the upgrade were not available, thencompanies might pass the II and IIX units down in the ranks and opt forpurchasing new IIfx units for the &quot;power users.&quot;andP;  I do not have any figuresto indicate how this might impact sales one way or another, but on thepositive side, maybe a company with a number of II's might purchase a singleupgrade to see how it works and then decide that it needs to upgrade all oftheir systems.andP;  It is anybody's guess, but I applaud Apple for once againconsidering their installed base.andM;Video CardsandM;Also announced along with the IIfx were two new video cards, the 4 .andP;  8 andthe 8 .andP;  24.andP;  [ed note: Apple has now created a problem for the media.andP;  Thereal names for these products are the 4 .andP;  8 and 8 .andP;  24 cards but by thetime we write this story, send the file to our editor via MCI mail, receiveit back on a PC, translate it back into Microsoft Word 4.0 on the Macintosh,code it for Page-Maker, and import the story, I can almost guarantee thatsome of these references will remain as 4(bullet) 8.andP;  The bullet is an 8level ASCII character and does not transfer between systems well.andP;  I am notsure exactly what it will become when sent via MCI mail or changed from onesystem to another, but I guess we are going to find out.andP;  Anyway, that shouldnot detract from the announcements.]  Apple has provided two very powerfulvideo cards.andP;  The first, the 4 .andP;  8 provides up to 256 colors or shades ofgray on the Apple High-Resolution Monitor, and the AppleColor High-ResolutionMonitor.andP;  It also provides up to 16 levels of gray on the Apple Portrait andtwo-page Monochrome display.andP;  The 8 .andP;  24 supports all Apple displays to themaximum of their capabilities, including full 256-level true gray scale (allthe shades of gray that the eye can see).andP;  In addition, it supports full24-bit true color on the AppleColor High-Resolution monitor.andM;The 4 .andP;  8 can be upgraded to the 8 .andP;  24 using the VRAM expansion kit soldby Apple.andP;  Both cards also support RS-170 standard timing for compatibilitywith numerous interlaced video devices.andP;  The 8 .andP;  24 also provides thehighest-possible quality interlaced video though the use of Apple Convolutionwhich evaluates adjacent lines and pixels on interlaced video devices andthen adjusts the image on the screen to provide smoother, more continuousimages.andM;Both of these cards extend the reach of Apple in the display arena and bothof these cards provide excellent resolution, gray- scale and colorrepresentations which will extend the reach of the Macintosh line ofcomputers.andM;Apple and UnixandM;Apple also unveiled version 2.0 of its A/UX operating system, which is Unixversion V, Release 2, version 2 with BSD 4.3 extensions (don't you just LOVEUnix release numbers?).andP;  Anyway, this is yet another major step for Apple inthe Unix market, and keeps them in step with the Unix systems being announcedon the RISC computer side of the Unix wars.andP;  The main advantage of Apple'sUnix is the fact that it runs under the Macintosh user environment.andM;Unix is very important for Apple because of their desire to stay a majorplayer in the corporate and educational marketplaces.andP;  Unix has a firmfoot-hold in these areas and while most analysts still believe that operatingsystems other than Unix will win the day, there is enough interest in Unixthat Apple must be able to provide it to remain a major player.andP;  The FederalGovernment market is also an important customer for the Unix operatingsystem.andM;X-Windows and UnixandM;Apple has also provided an X-Window system for their A/UX which provides theability for a Macintosh to run X-Client applications.andP;  Under this system,users may run the A/UX finder software, a special version of the MacintoshMultifinder adapted for A/UX.andP;  This combination permits Macintosh users torun X- Client applications, Macintosh productivity applications, and UNIXprograms concurrently.andM;With these two announcements, Apple has strengthened its role in the Unixworld, providing a later version of the operating system as well as making ituseable with X-Windows applications.andP;  Those customers who are interested inUNIX should welcome these Apple introductions.andP;  When coupled with the powerand speed of the IIfx, the new AU/X provides a robust operating environment.andM;Recapping it AllandM;For years there has been a see-saw battle between Apple and the rest of thePC community.andP;  First came the Apple II, then came IBM and DOS, next theMacintosh, and so on.andP;  What Apple has been able to do in the past few yearsis to keep ahead of the character based operating systems and provide userswith an easier to use way of becoming useful with a computer.andP;  Now, as theGraphical User Interface is becoming a reality on the Intel based machines,Apple has stepped out ahead of the pack with a hardware product that will bethe envy of the rest of the industry.andP;  The IIfx is truly a users' powerhouse.andO;Not only that, but coupled with the upcoming System 7.0, it will be a fiercecompetitor in the corporate marketplace.andM;While the Intel world is still struggling with the GUI (graphical userinterface), Apple has managed to marry a suburb hardware product with aGraphical User Environment (GUE), and also has thousands of robust and provenapplications behind it, ready to continue their inroads into corporateAmerica.andP;  I believe that the IIfx needs to be taken seriously as a high-end,fully functional PC and as a low to medium workstation contender.andP;  Well DoneApple!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
