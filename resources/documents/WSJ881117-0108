The idea is one of several being circulated at the Treasury Department, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Home Loan Bank Board, officials said. But they indicated such options haven't proceeded much past the brainstorming stage. Said one, &quot;It's early in the game.&quot;    Supporters of the off-budget move said it would help the new administration to avoid inflating the budget deficit with more than $50 billion in spending over several years to rescue or close insolvent thrifts. But some other officials worried that Congress would loudly reject the move as budgetary sleight-of-hand.    Officials also are talking of new, creative financing schemes that could raise large sums of cash for the funds without big hits to the budget. These involve making annual commitments of Treasury funds or pledging insurance fees from the FDIC or the bank board's Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to pay interest on major new bond offerings in the credit markets. But to keep most of the financing off the budget, officials need to find a credible, non-governmental source of cash to repay the principal. And so far, officials said, that hasn't been identified.    One option under discussion is to issue bonds guaranteed by a line of credit at the Treasury, with the Treasury paying all or part of the interest. &quot;It's one of the areas that we're looking at,&quot; said FDIC Chairman William Seidman.    Such a solution was implemented to rescue the Farm Credit System over the past year, with the interest payments split between the Treasury and the Farm Credit System. Eric Thor, president and chief executive officer of the Farm Credit System Assistance Board, said, &quot;That's one of the options being considered by my boss at Treasury, Secretary (Nicholas) Brady.&quot;    To minimize the budget impact, the Farm Credit System is pledged to repay both principal and Treasury interest payments in full. But that approach may not work in the deeply troubled thrift industry, which appears to lack the resources to repay in the foreseeable future the principal and interest on securities used to finance its own bailout.    &quot;The question is when it would be repaid,&quot; said one administration official. &quot;I don't want to hold my breath.&quot;    Key congressional staffers were even more skeptical. &quot;Everybody knows the (thrift) industry can't pay for it,&quot; said one.    That may tempt officials to look to the banks' insurance fund to provide the added financial backing. In fact, some bankers have floated a plan under which some FDIC premiums would be converted to help carry the cost of a bond-offering to rescue thrifts.    But that option faces many obstacles. The FDIC fund is generally viewed as too shaky to help much. Banking experts at Congress' General Accounting Office are expected to report soon that a merger of the insurance funds wouldn't contribute to solving the thrift problem. Most banks oppose using their fees to support their thrift competitors. And with political opposition to an insurance fund consolidation mounting, one administration official said talk about combining insurance funds is receding.    The option of taking the insurance funds off the budget was cited by two top officials yesterday, and is said to have the support of the FDIC's Mr. Seidman.    The finances of the insurance agencies weren't included in the federal budget until the mid-1960s, administration officials noted. President Johnson arranged to put them in the budget because their surpluses helped compensate for the budgetary drain of the Vietnam War, officials said.    But officials emphasized that such considerations remain preliminary. A team of Treasury Department officials, running thrift data and economic variables through sophisticated models, still hasn't agreed on the likely cost of the thrift problem, said one official. &quot;This is kind of study time,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
