Under the new law, in many cases, more benefits will accrue to married taxpayers who file their returns separately. Children will often be required to file their own returns or have returns filed for them.    And parents and grandparents who once firmed up family ties while getting a tax shelter out of transferring money or property to relatives will find that generosity is its own reward; at least, very little will be provided by the Internal Revenue Service.    The most sweeping change the new law brings is a crackdown on wealthy parents who used the lower tax rates that their children enjoyed as a way to shelter their own income. So many parents were exploiting the difference in rates that children's taxes often will be subject to a higher tax bite and more scrutiny in 1987. For these parents, what's being called a new &quot;kiddie tax,&quot; as well as other changes, could force a switch in financial strategy.    In 1987, there will be more reasons than ever for a married couple to consider filing separate tax returns. Before, if the incomes of the two spouses were disparate, and taxed in two different brackets, it often made sense to file together to average the tax rate paid by the couple.    But now, when the ability to take some deductions is tied to an income threshold, averaging the two salaries in a joint return could mean the lower-income spouse would be giving up valuable tax breaks.    Consider the case of a joint return filed by a married taxpayer who is covered by an employer pension or profit-sharing plan. The deductibility of an individual retirement account contribution begins to be phased out for both spouses when total adjusted gross income exceeds $40,000. Filing separately, however, the spouse with a pension or profit-sharing plan may fall below income restrictions, and the spouse without a qualified retirement plan will be able to deduct IRA contributions.    A higher threshold for the deduction of medical bills in 1987 -- 7.5% of adjusted gross income, rather than the current 5% -- will mean that one spouse with hefty medical expenses could lose the deduction if the couple files a joint return.    Conversely, filing jointly may be a good strategy if one spouse is likely to run afoul of the alternative minimum tax. This 21% tax kicks in for high-income taxpayers when it creates a larger tax bill than would normal calculations.    Although it may make some taxpayers blanch, Stuart Kessler, accountant and financial planner with Goldstein Golub Kessler andamp; Co. of New York, recommends that married taxpayers calculate, or have their accountant calculate, their returns both singly and jointly because &quot;it could make a big difference&quot; in the total bill.    For parents, the good news in 1987 is that the personal exemption for dependents is raised to $1,900 from $1,080 in 1986. The bad news is that children age 5 or over will be required to have a Social Security number and will have to file a tax return if they had more than $500 of investment income or $2,540 of earnings during the year. Children lose the personal exemption if claimed as a dependent by their parents.    Parents and children may be tempted not to file these returns, but the IRS's document-matching program, which corroborates a taxpayer's claims with records from financial institutions and some employers, &quot;would probably be able to detect a failure to file,&quot; says a spokesman. The taxpayer would receive a letter from the IRS requesting the tax due.    Taxation of a child's earnings and investment income is little changed in the new law for children over 14. But for younger children, the new tax law attempts to discourage &quot;income-shifting&quot; as a tax-shelter strategy.    Investment income earned by children under 14 is treated as if it had been their parent's income, and is taxed to the parent at the parent's rate -- usually 15% or 28%. However, this excludes a $500 exemption and the child's standard deduction of $500. Only a child's earned income will continue to be taxed at the child's rate -- usually 15%.    It used to be a common strategy for parents to open &quot;Clifford trusts&quot; for children in which the child received the income from the trust for 10 years, and then the money reverted to the parent. These are effectively useless under the new tax law, since the person who contributes to the trust or the parent is taxed, depending upon the age of the child and when the trust was opened.    But just because the trusts no longer offer tax advantages doesn't mean a parent can simply reclaim the money or assets from the trust. That money is legally the child's for the life of the trust.    The way to cope with the so-called kiddie tax and other changes is for parents to buy securities that defer as much investment income as possible until the child turns 14. Growth stocks, zero-coupon municipal bonds and 10-year government bonds are good choices. Also, if the parent is considering selling appreciated property that would be subject to tax at the parent's own rate, the parent should consider transferring the property to a child. Once the child turns 14, the property can be sold and the proceeds would be taxed at the child's rate.    If the taxpayer runs a family business, it's advantageous to put children to work and pay them handsomely. The child's income is taxed at the child's rate and the parent gets the benefit of the salary deduction on the business tax return (but must deduct Social Security from the salary).    If parents who are generous with a motive are treated harshly, grandparents fare no better. Grandparents making gifts to children exceeding $2 million will face a &quot;generation-skipping tax&quot; that generally equals inheritance tax plus gift tax.    For families breaking up, the tax treatment of alimony and child support is unchanged from previous law, but lower tax rates and the lessened value of home mortgage deductions, among other changes, may prompt a restructuring of some divorce settlements. A taxpayer making alimony payments can deduct them, but cannot deduct child support payments. The spouse receiving alimony and child support is taxed on the former income but not the latter.    But taxpayers making alimony payments will find them more expensive under the lower tax rates, costing more in net income. Divorce attorneys add there may be less reluctance on the part of one spouse to give up the family home, because the tax deductions attached to it will be less valuable. The personal exemptions for children, however, now almost doubled to $1,900 in 1987, may become an important bargaining chip in divorce negotiations.    In an extended family, the tax advantages of taking an elderly parent or parents as dependents should be reexamined in light of the new tax law.    Under both 1986 and 1987 tax law, taxpayers can opt to take an elderly parent as a dependent, whether or not the parent resides with them, if they provide more than half of the parents' support and the parent has little more than Social Security income, according to Sherwin Gilbert, accountant with Seidman andamp; Seidman/BDO.    If the elderly parent doesn't file a tax return -- and many do not, because of their small incomes -- and the child provides more than half of the parent's support, it is often advantageous for the child to claim the parent as a dependent, says Rebecca Lee, an accountant and financial planner with Brooke, Freeman andamp; Lee of Montgomery, Ala.    The health care costs the parent incurs, but wasn't planning to deduct, may help the family cross the 7.5% threshold for medical expense deductions.    If the parent usually files a tax return, however, tax calculations for both situations -- dependent and filing separately -- should be done, she advises.    Outright gifts to parents, up to a threshold amount, are still treated favorably under the new tax law. A married taxpayer can give a parent as much as $20,000 annually without paying gift tax, while a single taxpayer can give $10,000 to each parent. The parent can then invest the gift and, if retired, will often pay a lower tax rate on the investment income than the child would have.    At the time of the parent's death, the money will revert to the child. Federal estate taxes will not be charged unless the net value of the parent's estate exceeds $600,000, compared with $500,000 under the old tax law.    ---   Ms. Peers is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.    ---                 How Uncle Sam Will Tax Children                          Child under        Child 14    Type of income        Age 14             or Older*    Earnings              Child's tax rate   Child's rate    Investment income     $500 deductible,   Child's rate    up to $1,000          remainder at                          child's rate    Investment income     Parent's rate      Child's rate    over $1,000    Trust income          Income over        Child's rate    (on contributions     $1,000 taxed to    made prior to         child at    March 2, 1986)        parent's rate    Trust income          All income taxed   All income taxed    (for contributions    to contributor at  to contributor    made from             contributor's      at contributor's    March 2, 1986 on)     rate               rate    *For taxable year in which child turns 14    Source: Prentice-Hall Information Services Inc.    ---                  Federal Estate Taxes in 1987    Net taxable estates* are subject to the following rates:                          Pay base tax of   Plus % of amount    Estates of up to      (in thousands)    over lower range    $600,000               $      0               0%    $750,000                      0              37    $1 million                 55.5              39    $1.25 million             153.0              41    $1.5 million              255.5              43    $2 million                363.0              45    $2.5 million              588.0              49    $3 million                833.0              53    Above $3 million        1,098.0              55   The tax on a $700,000 estate, for example would be$37,000, which is 37% of $100,000, the amount by which theestate exceeds the $600,000 that's exempt from taxes.   *The net taxable estate is defined as the stocks, bonds,cash, real estate and other assets of a deceased taxpayer,minus property left to a surviving spouse, attorney's andexecutor's fees, funeral expenses and charitable gifts.
