The reduction, announced Monday, had been called long overdue bymany economists since most other interest rates had dropped aseconomic growth continues to slow down.   It followed an identical rate reduction three weeks ago by ChaseManhattan Bank. But aside from a few smaller banks, only Bank ofAmerica, which lowered its prime Friday, had taken Chase's cue.   ``Banks view cutting the prime rate the way most of us view atrip to the dentist ... but they know that sooner or later theyhave to,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist for NikkoSecurities Co. International.   Economists speculated the big banks didn't immediately followChase's July 10 rate cut partly because they wanted to determinewhether the Federal Reserve would keep pursuing lower interestrates as it had recently to prevent the economy from falling into arecession.   ``The sentiment in the marketplace was that Chase was too earlyand everyone else was waiting until the federal funds rate stayedbelow 9 percent,'' said Elizabeth G. Reiners, an economist withDean Wittter Reynolds Inc. ``But they could have easily done thatby the end of last week.''   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans betweenbanks, traded at 8 15-16 percent late Monday, unchanged fromFriday. The Fed controls the key rate by adding or subtractingbanking reserves.   Other interest rates in the credit markets have been fallingsteadily. The yield on the widely watched 30-year Treasury bond was7.91 percent late Monday, down from a 7.98 percent close on Fridaythat marked the first finish below 8 percent since spring 1987.Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages also have fallen, dropping below10 percent over the past few weeks.   Meanwhile, rates on savings accounts have slipped, with theaverage yield on a six-month certificate of deposit down to 8.47percent last week from 8.52 percent the previous week, according tothe newsletter Bank Rate Monitor.   The prime reflects a bank's cost of money, such as the interestit pays on savings accounts or CDs, and therefore generally trailsmore subtle changes in other rates.   As a result of Monday's concerted rate-lowering action,borrowing costs for some consumers and businesses are expected todecline more broadly because the prime is used as a basis forcalculating many fixed and adjustable-rate loans, such as creditcard rates and home equity loans.   Bond and stock prices rose following Monday's action, whichbegan with an announcement by First Bank of Chicago shortly beforethe stock market opened. Other big banks quickly followed suit,including Citibank, the nation's largest.   F. Ward McCarthy, a principal at Stone andamp; McCarthy ResearchAssociates Inc., said banks had been reluctant to cut their primebefore Monday because business had been sluggish.   ``When the economy is slowing down, loan demand slows down.Banks try to bolster revenue ... by keeping their lending ratesup,'' McCarthy said.   The government reported last week that the economy expanded at arate of 1.7 percent in the second quarter, the slowest rate inthree years.   McCarthy and other economists said interest rates shouldcontinue to fall through the end of the year, with some predictingrates would fall far enough to push the prime below 10 percent.   The prime stood at 10.5 percent at the start of 1989. It wasraised twice in February to 11.5 percent, then lowered a halfpercentage point on June 5. Those movements reflected changingperceptions about economic growth and inflation.</TEXT></DOC>
