The net result of hundreds of education-related bills enactedduring the past decade has been contradiction and confusion,concluded the report by researchers Linda Darling-Hammond andBarnett Barry.   School reform has yet to settle whether teachers areprofessionals possessing a body of knowledge and capable of dealingwith the individual needs of students, or whether they are merely``semiskilled workers'' needing constant supervision, theresearchers said.   Still, the report found that average salaries rose 31 percentfrom 1981 to 1986 to $25,240, and 19 states adopted minimum salaryschedules. More recent figures from the National EducationAssociation estimate average salaries at $28,000 this year.   Starting salaries are also up, but not enough to close the gapbetween teaching and other professions. According to NEA figures,the average was $17,500 in 1987, while beginning accountants,chemists, computer specialists and engineers, for example, allearned in excess of $20,000.   Overall, the average teacher's purchasing power is practicallyunchanged from 1971-72 levels, according to the analysis.   Nearly all states considered performance-based pay systems,including merit pay, from 1983 to 1986. But such programs oftenhave encountered delays because of teacher opposition and lack offunds.   Twenty-seven states enacted tougher teacher trainingrequirements, including testing of academic ability and minimumgrade-point averages. States are increasingly stressing liberalarts background over education courses.   ``Paradoxically, for a number of states, improving teacherpreparation seems to mean reducing the amount of time devoted totraditional teacher education,'' the report said.   By 1986, 46 states required teacher competency testing foradmission to teacher education or certification or both. But suchtesting has stalled in many states because of lack of funding orquestions about the tests's validity.   In a contradiction, 46 states have cleared the way forsubstandard, limited emergency certification. Twenty-seven of thosestates issue certificates to people lacking even a bachelor'sdegree to solve teacher shortages.   ``This practice undermines the tenet ... that only those whohave mastered a specialized knowledge base will be admitted topractice,'' the report said.   National Education Association President Mary Hatwood Futrellcalled the Rand report ``right on target.''   Bruce Goldberg, assistant director of educational issues for theAmerican Federation of Teachers, called the report ``obviouslycorrect. If teaching is to become a true profession, then teacherswill have to be granted the kind of autonomy required of any otherprofession.''   The Rand study is being published nearly five years after theReagan administration issued the report ``A Nation at Risk,'' whichblasted mediocrity in U.S. schools.   While initial reform efforts aimed at boosting salaries andtoughening teacher certification requirements, a more recent waveof reforms has stressed freeing teachers from unnecessaryregulations and boosting their status.   In effect, reformers in the last two years have come to believethat there should be higher standards to enter teaching, but fewerrules about what and how to teach.   ``This is, in essence, the bargain that all professions makewith society,'' the report said.   ``The next generation of teacher policy reform will need tofocus on the content and nature of effective teaching, itsassessment, and its deployment within schools to ensure that thelong-range goals of the reformers are met,'' the report concluded.</TEXT></DOC>
