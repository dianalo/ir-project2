The CAW, which represents 4,100 of de Havilland's 5,400 employees, said it objects to &quot;concession demands&quot; by the company to alter existing in-plant work rules. De Havilland said it needs more flexible work rules to make the commuter aircraft maker more competitive. Neither side expects to resume talks right away. The CAW struck the company when its three-year contract expired June 22. </TEXT></DOC>
