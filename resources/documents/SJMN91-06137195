How much timeis too long behind bars before seeing a judge?;    In this country, one dayhas been the traditional limit required between arrest and arraignment. Thatensured Americans' right to a prompt release in mistaken or malicious arrests.However, the Constitution and the U.S. Supreme Court had never defined promptrelease down to the hour.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TOO LONG BEHIND BARSTHE CONSTITUTION PROMISES ARRESTEES A PROMPTHEARING -- NOT 48 HOURS IN JAIL  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     Earlier this week, the Rehnquist Court decided the limit should be 48hours, and thus continued nibbling at the rights of people accused of crime.;   Arrests without warrant are common, as when police witness a crime inprogress. Wanted criminals usually have warrants issued against them. Jailingswithout warrant happen to most everyone else who is arrested, and plenty ofthem are law-abiding people.;    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing theopinion for the 5-4 majority, failed to cite a constitutional basis for48-hour detention. As Justice Antonin Scalia indicated in a minority opinion,it's as if the majority pulled 48 hours out of thin air.;    O'Connor wrotethat two days' time allows for emergencies and &quot;other extraordinarycircumstances&quot; faced by the judicial system. The majority overruled alower-court decision against Riverside County, which often takes more than twodays to get someone before a judge.;    O'Connor's opinion gives too muchweight to the logistical needs of the judicial system, such as backlogs andinefficiency, and not enough to the basic American principle of protecting theinnocent from wrongful arrest.;    Twenty-nine states get by with 24 hours.The American Bar Association says six hours is enough in most cases.;    Moststates understand what the high court in a 1975 decision meant by &quot;prompt&quot;judicial hearings. The Rehnquist Court, by straying from the Constitution topick 48 hours, does not or cares not.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910516  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  314  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 16, 199100137195,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
