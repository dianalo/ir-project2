The regulations, drawn up in response to arms-smuggling scandals last year, are aimed at barring the sale of Swedish-made weapons to all but approved countries. A panel would be set up to look into reducing arms exports. In the meantime, arms makers would have to ask government permission to sign arms contracts.    A simmering scandal over FFV's arms exports during the past 25 years has overshadowed the government proposals by revealing a pattern of ignoring arms-export rules. The latest revelation came yesterday, when an FFV spokeswoman confirmed a newspaper report that the company had sold about 450 Carl-Gustaf anti-tank rifles and ammunition to Saudi Arabia between 1978 and 1984 for an estimated $19.4 million. Saudi Arabia has been off limits to Swedish arms makers since 1956.    The government is also investigating FFV's involvement in supplying Carl-Gustaf ammunition to Australian troops fighting in Vietnam in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as reports of a sale to Israel of Carl-Gustaf guns that may have ended up in South Africa.    The disclosures about FFV's arms sales have rekindled a furor that erupted early last year, when private arms maker AB Bofors admitted selling antiaircraft weapons to Oman, Dubai and Bahrain. The scandal heightened when customs investigators accused Bofors, a unit of Nobel Industrier Sverige AB, of helping to supply Iran with munitions for its war with Iraq. </TEXT></DOC>
