Allan Hubbard, who is also Vice President Dan Quayle'sdeputy chief of staff, disclosed his plans in a letter toRep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) that was released at a hearingon the conflict-of-interest issue yesterday. Mr. Hubbardnoted that the White House counsel's office and theindependent Office of Government Ethics &quot;found no improperactivity.&quot; But he said, &quot;I trust that these measures will putall these issues to rest and will allow us to return to thediscussion and debate of the important policy matters aboutwhich we both care so much.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Hubbard has drawn criticism after the disclosure thathe presided over a meeting at which officials altered aproposed clean-air rule in a way that benefits PSI ResourcesInc., a company in which he holds about $18,000 in stock. Inaddition, Mr. Hubbard is half-owner of a chemical-processingcompany, World Wide Chemical Inc., which could be subject toclean-air rules.   The PSI stock will be given to charities and a museum inIndianapolis; other assets will be placed into a blind trust.   It isn't clear, however, whether Mr. Hubbard's actionswill satisfy congressional Democrats, who have complainedvigorously about the conflicts issue and about what they seeas the council's efforts to use the regulation-writingprocess to weaken the clean-air law. Rep. Waxman toldreporters after the hearing that creating the blind trust&quot;will not solve the problem of the conflict of interest,&quot;because Mr. Hubbard will remain aware of what holdings wentinto the trust.   Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.) said the &quot;blind trust doesnot erase the possible taint of his past activities onregulatory decisions.&quot;   At the same time, committee Republicans boycotted thehearing, which Rep. Norman Lent (R., N.Y.) called &quot;partisangrandstanding designed to discredit the council.&quot; Mr. Hubbardalso declined to attend.   Lawmakers heard testimony from several law schoolprofessors who specialize in ethics and who supported Mr.Waxman's contention that Mr. Hubbard's financial interestspose conflict-of-interest problems. Among other complaints,the professors criticized as inappropriate and overly broadthe waiver granted by Vice President Quayle, who is thecompetitiveness council's chairman, that allows Mr. Hubbardto participate in the regulatory deliberations despite hisholdings.   Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) and other lawmakerscriticized the council for failing to place some of theregulatory advice they gave to Environmental ProtectionAgency officials in writing, meaning it wouldn't become partof the public record. EPA officials, who also testified,recalled several occasions when they asked for comments inwriting from White House officials and were turned down.   Bush administration officials yesterday defended theirpolicy of keeping some information and comments out of thepublic record as an effort to foster as free an exchange aspossible among members of the executive branch.</TEXT></DOC>
