Terms call for National Data to issue 1.6 million new common shares to stockholders of Libra, a closely held company based in Hagerstown, Md.    Separately, Stewart B. Gold, Libra president, has agreed to pay Signature Capital Corp. $300,000 for 424,528 National Data shares, an option to buy 142,500 common shares and a $200,000 demand note. Signature Capital is National Data's largest shareholder.    After the transactions, Mr. Gold will own 56% of National Data's 3.1 million shares outstanding.    Mr. Gold, and two Libra officers, Benjamin R. Baker and Kathleen M. Hornung, will join National Data's board after the transactions, and Andrew Durco Jr., National Data's former chief financial officer, will resign as a director, leaving the board with five members.    National Data sells software systems to hospitals. Libra sells a newer technology that allows hospitals to connect their computer systems in a network. The transaction is expected to be completed later this month.    In over-the-counter trading yesterday, National Data shares were quoted at $1.625 bid. </TEXT></DOC>
