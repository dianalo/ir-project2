Coke bottles spin down conveyor belts to the strains of classical music. Happy Coke ads trumpet the product. Diagrams explain the workings of the stock market. &quot;Our directors want you to become a shareholder,&quot; says ABI's managing director, Alex Reid, his face filling the screen. &quot;It is a simply wonderful opportunity.&quot;    It would seem so. As part of Coca-Cola Co.'s disinvestment from South Africa, ABI, formerly controlled by the U.S. company, is offering 11 million shares at one South African rand (49 cents) apiece to its predominantly black labor force and to its small mom-and-pop dealers. The shares carry an 11% dividend plus a guaranteed repurchase price of 1.60 rand in 18 months. &quot;You can't lose,&quot; says Mr. Reid.    In most other countries, people would be beating down doors to get in on the action. But in South Africa, where even the nuts and bolts of free enterprise are entangled in the politics of apartheid, the ABI offer, and others like it, has generated as much controversy as excitement. In this country, which has a long history of white paternalism, it is the sweetheart deals that seem the most suspicious.    &quot;It is a ploy to blunt the militancy of the employees,&quot; says George Nene, the leader of the black union at ABI's bottling plant just west of town. &quot;It doesn't give us any more control over our destinies. No amount of convincing will make us believe this is a good idea.&quot;    The idea, which is catching on rapidly in South Africa's boardrooms despite mounting union opposition, is to broaden blacks' involvement in the country's white-dominated economy by offering them shares in the companies in which they work. Such participation, white business leaders hope, will give blacks a greater appreciation of capitalism -- which is widely equated with apartheid -- while instilling more worker loyalty.    At the moment, more than two dozen companies -- including some of South Africa's largest corporations, as well as such disinvesting foreign concerns as Coca-Cola, Ford Motor Co. and Britain's Standard Chartered PLC -- are dangling attractive stock ownership plans before their employees and customers. &quot;The object,&quot; says Mr. Reid, &quot;is to place shares in as many hands as possible.&quot;    Some hands, long deprived of the chance to share in the country's wealth, are grabbing eagerly. &quot;Where do I sign?&quot; asks Joshua Morgan, the owner of Morgan's Mini-Market, after watching the video. An ABI secretary fills out a check and points to the bottom line, where Mr. Morgan scribbles his signature. He's just bought 1,100 shares, his entire allotment, which is based on his store's Coke sales.    &quot;It's my first time to buy stock,&quot; he says, smiling broadly.    But others, hardened by a history of white attempts to co-opt blacks, are resisting the temptation. Some black unions and business organizations reject the offers as tokenism, calling on the white owners to share the means of production, as well as the profits. And, they argue, greater economic participation for blacks has little meaning when the government still denies them political participation.    &quot;Twenty years ago we might have accepted the offers, figuring that getting half the loaf is better than nothing. But times have changed,&quot; says Peter Temane of the Soweto Chamber of Commerce and Industries, which represents businessmen in the huge black township outside Johannesburg. &quot;There is no way you can separate economics from politics. The core of the issue isn't economics. The core is politics.&quot;    This attitude is particularly frustrating for well-meaning liberal businessmen, who believe that economic upliftment and political advancement go hand in hand. ABI has gone to great lengths -- including printing parts of the prospectus in the Zulu and Sesotho languages -- to inform its 3,500 employees and 7,000 independent dealers of the share offer, which closes at the end of this month. So far, about 45% of the employees and 15% of the dealers have bought shares. Mr. Reid is aiming for 60% overall participation.    &quot;To launch this thing into the current political situation isn't easy,&quot; sighs Mr. Reid. &quot;Everything has a heavy political overtone in this country.&quot;    The current situation, particularly in labor relations, is one of widespread mistrust and confrontation, with many of the political demands of the country's disenfranchised blacks being voiced in South Africa's factories and mines. Unionists view the share offers as attempts to stifle this growing militancy: once employees have a financial stake in a company, they reason, there will be less motivation to fight for wage and benefit gains.    &quot;How can you own shares in a company which you are fighting against?,&quot; asks Mr. Nene, a regional director of the Food and Allied Workers Union, which has rejected the ABI offer. &quot;You can't stand with one foot in hot water and another one in cold water.&quot; Other unions, including the National Union of Metalworkers and the Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union, have similarly scorned share offers.    &quot;The shares don't let us participate in the decisions of the company, only the profits,&quot; adds Mr. Nene. &quot;At the end of the day you can still be fired.&quot;    The Soweto Chamber of Commerce and Industries has also rejected the ABI offer, saying the Coca-Cola dealers would be better off owning one of ABI's seven bottling plants than thousands of its shares.    &quot;They expect us to jump up and down and say 'Hallelujah, we're in the money,'&quot; says Mr. Temane. &quot;But what does it really mean? At night we still have to come back to Soweto, to our mealiemeal {ground corn, a staple} and little houses.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
