These regulations also restrict the importationinto the United States of certain articles from foreign countries and localities,including certain plants and plant products, as a means of preventing theentry into the United States of certain injurious plant diseases, injuriousinsect pests, and other plant pests.  Restricted articles, with the exception of certain restricted articlesfrom Canada, can be imported or offered for importation into the the UnitedStates only at ports of entry listed in andSection; 319.37-14(b) of the regulations.Restricted articles that are not required to be imported under a writtenpermit pursuant to andSection; 319.37-3(a) (1) through (6) of the regulationscan be imported or offered for importation at any port of entry listedin paragraph (b) of 319.37-14. However, restricted articles that are requiredto be imported under a written permit pursuant to andSection; 319.37-3(a)(1) through (6) of the regulations can only be imported or offered forimportation at parts of entry designated by an astrisk in andSection; 319.37-14(b).These latter ports of entry have plant inspection stations; i.e., specialinspection and treatment facilities. Restricted articles that are requiredto be imported under a written permit pursuant to andSection; 319.37-3(a)(1) through (6) of the regulations must be imported only at ports of entrythat have a plant inspection station because these restricted articlesappear to present a substantial risk of carrying injurious plant diseases,insect pests, or other plant pests at the time of importation. Plant inspectionstations have the special treatment and inspection facilities adequatefor taking necessary action with respect to such articles in order to preventthe introduction of accompanying injurious plant diseases, injurious insectpests, or other plant pests.  Only some of the ports of entry listed in paragraph (b) of andSection; 319.37-14have plant inspection stations. Texas currently has 15 ports of entry,but only three of these ports_Brownsville, El Paso, and Laredo_have plantinspection stations. A fourth plant inspection station would provide amore conveniently located facility for importers in the Houston area, andwould relieve the workload on other plant inspection stations in the area.We are therefore proposing to add a plant inspection station at the portof Houston, Texas. This new station would have the special inspection andtreatment facilities needed to import certain restricted articles, includingcertain plants and plant products, that are required to be imported undera written permit pursuant to andSection; 319.37-3(a) (1) through (6) of theregulations. These restricted articles cannot be imported through Houston'sexisting inspection location, because it does not have a plant inspectionstation which is equipped with the necessary holding, treatment, and inspectionfacilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291,and we have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule would havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; would not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and would notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The addition of a plant inspection station in Houston, Texas, would facilitatethe importation of restricted articles, including certain plants, intothe United States. We believe the addition of this facility would havea positive but small economic impact on importers, since Texas alreadyhas three inspection stations through which plants requiring written permitspursuant to andSection; 319.37-3(a) (1) through (6) of the regulations maybe imported. We have no way of projecting how heavily the new plant inspectionstation would be used, but we estimate that between 5 and 20 commercialimporters_most of them small entities_would use these new facility on aregular basis. Most of them would realize small savings in transportationcosts since they would now have access to a fourth plant inspection station.The primary impact on these importers, therefore, would be increased convenience.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmentalconsultation with state and local officials.
