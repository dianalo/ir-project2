McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Undersecretary of Commerce Michael R. Darbysaid Monday successful inflation-fighting efforts are steering theeconomy to a so-called ``soft-landing'' _ slower but continuedgrowth, but no recession.   ``The economic expansion is proceeding at a sustainable pace withfavorable prospects for continued growth ahead,'' he said in aspeech prepared for the annual meeting of The InternationalInsurance Society in Chicago. Copies were made available here.   At the same time, Darby said, ``We are about to experience adiminution of inflationary pressures brought about by pastrestrictive measures of the Federal Reserve.''   Until recently, the Fed had tightened its grip on credit to slowthe economy and thus stem inflation. It began easing its grip lastmonth and permitted a key interest rate to decline slightly againlast week.   In response, short-term interest rates in the bond market havebeen falling steadily. And on Monday, Chase Manhattan Bank loweredits prime lending rate by a half percentage point to 10.5 percent,the second such reduction in as many months. Other commrcial bankswere expected to follow suit.   Darby noted concerns that inflation may be accelerating againbecause of consumer and producer price increases so far this yearbut said those concerns are misplaced.   ``The recent price increases are temporary effects ofdrought-related food price rises and of increases in oil priceswhich do not seem to be continuing,'' he said.   Darby also noted the economy now is in its seventh year ofgrowth, ``the longest peacetime expansion in our history,'' which hesaid ``makes pessimists worry, saying we are due for a recession.   ``But economic history teaches us that expansions have not diedof old age, but were killed by policies _ usually monetary policies_ which, with the benefit of hindsight, were unfortunate mistakes,''he contended.   Darby pointed out current policies he said will foster continuedeconomic improvement.   ``At present, the economy is experiencing moderate growth, withthe major stimulus coming from business fixed investment andexports,'' he said. ``The consumer is spending cautiously _ saving abit more of after-tax income than in recent years.   ``Housing has weakened, but recent reductions in mortgageinterest rates may offer some relief in months ahead,'' hecontinued. ``Defense industries are in a period of retrenchmentafter a lengthy buildup ... Inventory investment generally has beenconservative, though the auto industry currently has problems withtoo many unsold cars.   ``Given these crosscurrents in economic activity and thefavorable inflation outlook, prospects are good for growth in thenonfarm economy in the 2 to 3 percent range over the four quartersof 1989 _ what is being called a `soft-landing.'''</TEXT></DOC>
