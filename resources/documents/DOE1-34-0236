A number of applications were reviewed: currentlyused surfactants, the largest volume asphalt applications, providingsubstitutes for phenol in phenol-formaldehyde thermosetting resins andother adhesive systems, as a component of engineered plastics, as carbonblack replacements, and as feedstock for fuels production. Market opportunitieswere reviewed in several categories, and measures of intensity of demandwere made for the year 2000. The chemical characterization of ligninsisolated from various pretreatments such as steam explosion and organosolvprocesses has been carried out for aspen. The isolation includes theextraction of the lignins from the pretreated lignocellulosic cake withsuch solvents as dilute sodium hydroxide or mixtures of aqueous and non-aqueoussolvents. Organosolv lignins isolated from methanol/water solutions werealso investigated. Chemical, functional, and spectroscopic analyses havebeen carried out on these lignins. Another important characterizationparameter they investigated is the molecular weight distributions ofthese lignins by high performance size exclusion chromatography and complementarytechniques.</TEXT></DOC>
