The case of indoor exposure to nitrogendioxide (NO{sub 2}) and fine particles (RSP) and its effect on pulmonaryfunction and respiratory disease was selected for this purpose for thefollowing reasons. First, several epidemiological studies on in issueare currently underway and previous studies have produced conflictingresults, which have been linked to problems in measuring exposure. Second,the commonly used exposure surrogates in these studies are subject toboth classical and Berkson type of error. Third, more than one independentvariable is involved, which limits the possibilities of a analyticalapproach. Fourth, sufficient data is available from studies on indoorair quality to estimate the nature and degree of error in exposure surrogates.Fifth, both linear and logistic regression techniques are used in thesetypes of studies.</TEXT></DOC>
