The rules issued Thursday by the National Labor Relations Boardalso appear likely to intensify the already heated competitionbetween two major unions seeking to establish themselves as theleader in the health-care sector, union officials say.   Those unions, the American Federation of State, County andMunicipal Employees and the Service Employees International Union,represent about 300,000 health care workers each and are competingto win the affiliation of the 75,000-member National Union ofHospital and Health Care Employees, whose members decide the issuenext month.   The NLRB rules, published in today's Federal Register, createeight categories of hospital employees, distinctions that willprohibit hospitals from lumping together in prospective bargainingunits workers with widely varying tasks, such as nurses andjanitors.   Unions contend hospitals have used such tactics to stymieorganizing efforts. Now, if a union can win an election amongworkers in any one category the hospital would have to recognize itas the collective bargaining agent for that group.   The hospital industry, which has opposed the new rulesthroughout the rulemaking procedure, said it planned to challengethem in court on grounds they violate 1974 legislation designed toprevent ``undue proliferation'' of bargaining units within thehealth care industry.   ``What we see occurring are stepped-up efforts to place hospitalemployees in these numerous bargaining units,'' said MichaelAnthony, executive vice president of the American HospitalAssociation. ``We see that resulting in a myriad of differentbenefit packages, contracts with varying termination dates, thepotential for work stoppages and a number of negotiations thatmight be ongoing at a given time. It all adds up to additionalcosts being incurred by the hospitals.''   The unions, not surprisingly, offered different interpretations.   ``The ruling sends a clear signal to hospitals to accept thefact that health care workers want to organize,'' said AFSCMEPresident Gerald W. McEntee.   ``We see it as a major victory for health care workers,'' saidSEIU attorney Jonathan Hiatt. ``These rules should finally providea real opportunity for those health care workers who wish toorganize to gain a voice.''   Hiatt said the ruling raised the stakes in next month'saffiliation election because the winner could be viewed as thepremier health-care union.   ``I have no question that there are other unions out there whoare interested in organizing this industry,'' he said withoutreferring to AFSCME.   AFSCME is the larger of the unions, with 1.2 million members asopposed to SEIU's 850,000.   The regulations are little changed from proposed rules issued inSeptember. The NLRB said it believed its decision to recognizeeight categories met the congressional mandate.   Congress, in adopting that provision, said that health carecould be unduly disrupted if hospital management had to deal withtoo many unions, such as the dozen or more unions sometimes foundin construction and other industries.   The rules effectively reverse a 1984 NLRB decision allowing onlythree or four bargaining units at hospitals. Since that decisionthe number of hospital workers nationwide who belong to unionsdropped from 23 percent to 19 percent, according to union figures.Disputes over the structure of prospective bargaining units led todozens of NLRB and court cases.   The eight categories listed in the final rules are: physicians;registered nurses; all professionals except physicians andregistered nurses; technical employees such as lab workers; skilledmaintenance workers; business office clerical workers; guards; andall other non-professional employees.   The rules apply to acute care hospitals. Exempt are nursinghomes, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals and otherhealth care facilities. Units of five or fewer employees also wouldbe exempt from the rules.</TEXT></DOC>
