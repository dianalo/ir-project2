The meeting was closed to the media but described byparticipants as a frank and cordial discussion of what Dukakisneeds to do to win the support of Jackson's black constituency.   Jackson himself, campaigning in New Jersey, said he didn't wanthis support ``isolated by race.'' But he spoke kindly of Dukakis'overtures to the black community.   ``He has an obligation to reach out,'' said Jackson.   Dukakis also attended a Memorial Day service and met at theStatehouse with Argentine President Raul Alfonsin. The two met twoyears ago when Alfonsin was in Massachusetts and they exchangedwarm greetings after the private meeting.   Dukakis was to tend to state business today and attendreceptions in Baltimore tonight.   He was to be back at the Statehouse Wednesday before heading toCalifornia, New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana in the week leftuntil the June 7 primaries in those states, which are expected togive Dukakis a lock on the nomination.   Although participants in the Monday gathering were unanimous inpredicting Jackson would support Dukakis in the fall, the sessionwas designed partly to plot strategy for seeking black supportregardless of Jackson's role.   ``He showed his compassion and his understanding of the plightof black Americans,'' former New Orleans Mayor Dutch Morial said.And he said Dukakis' affirmative action record as governor and hiscommitments to economic opportunity, health care and housing wouldappeal to black voters.   ``The record is an excellent one,'' said Thomasina Reed of LosAngeles, a potential Dukakis delegate.   Participants said Dukakis promised to offer some Jacksoncampaign aides jobs in the fall campaign and also promised thatblacks and other minorities would have major roles in a Dukakisadministration.   ``Very clearly the presence of black Americans in this campaignis going to have to be expanded,'' said Charlene Drew Jarvis, amember of the District of Columbia City Council. ``We got thatcommitment from today from Mike Dukakis.''   Dukakis was not specific about what role he believed Jacksonshould have. He is not expected to offer Jackson the No. 2 spot onthe ticket.   ``What kind of role would I play if I came in second and he camein first?'' Dukakis asked rhetorically. ``I would be out thereworking for a Democratic victory.''   Jackson, too, said he expected to have ``a big role at theconvention and a big role this fall,'' but added: ``That role hasnot been determined.''   Longtime Dukakis supporter Joseph Warren, who organized themeeting, said black Dukakis supporters with ties to Jackson aideswould hold frequent talks with them in the month leading into theJuly convention.</TEXT></DOC>
