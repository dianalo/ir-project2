The first device,multiwire drift tube with many closely spaced individual detection elements,is very challenging from both the mechanical and electronics points ofview, but is certainly feasible; the second approach, based on the parallel-platechamber, is perhaps more revolutionary but appears still rather difficultto operate.</TEXT></DOC>
