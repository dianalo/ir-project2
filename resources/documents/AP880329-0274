African Unrest</HEAD><BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Platinum futures prices surged $7 a troy ounce Tuesday on theNew York Mercantile Exchange as the economic outlook continued tobrighten and racial unrest in South Africa prompted fears of supplydisruptions, analysts said.   On other exchanges, gold futures retreated while silveradvanced; energy futures were mixed; grains and soybeans weremixed; livestock and meat were mostly lower; and stock-indexfutures advanced.   Platinum prices have been gradually re-establishing theirtraditional dominance over gold after falling to an even par withthe yellow metal late last year, when recession fears werewidespread.   Although it is considered a precious metal, platinum is also anindustrial base metal and is more widely used by industry than gold.   ``In a healthy economy, platinum is likely to do better thangold,'' said Craig Sloane, an analyst in New York with SmithBarney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. ``The economic activity we've seen inthe last couple of months is very positive for platinum.''   Tuesday's government report showing a 0.9 percent increase inFebruary in the index of leading economic indicators furtherdispelled fears that the October stock market collapse was aharbinger of recession, Sloane said.   Most platinum comes from South Africa, and a recent upswing inviolence there sparked fears of supply problems that helped supportplatinum prices, said Peter Cardillo, commodity futures tradingadviser for Josephthal andamp; Co. in New York.   Platinum settled $7 to $8.30 higher with the contract fordelivery in April at $518.70 a troy ounce.   Tuesday's economic data had little impact on gold and silverfutures prices, which registered only slight moves on New York'sCommodity Exchange.   Gold settled 30 cents to 60 cents lower with April at $455.60 atroy ounce; silver was 3 cents to 4 cents higher with March at$6.705 a troy ounce.   Indications of continued overproduction by the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries sent crude oil futures prices slidinglower in light trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, saidMichael Rothman, senior energy strategist for Merrill Lynch CapitalMarkets.   In addition, the market was skeptical that an OPEC meeting nextmonth will produce support for a production cut, Rothman said.   Heating oil futures prices also declined while unleaded gasolinegained a bit.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents lower acrossthe board with May at at $16.98 a barrel; heating oil was .02 centto .40 cent lower with April at 48.15 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .10 cent lower to .24 cent higher with April at 48.26cents a gallon.   Soybean futures settled lower on the Chicago Board of Trade butthe grains finished nearly unchanged.   The decline in soybean prices was mostly due to profit-takingafter Monday's sharp advances, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader forDean Witter Reynolds Inc.   Contracts for May and July delivery of corn advanced slightly inreaction to news that the government had granted one-yearextensions on certain corn loans taken out in 1984, 1985 and 1986.   The extensions mean farmers can delay decisions about marketinghundreds of millions of bushels of corn that might otherwise havegone onto the market this year.   Wheat settled { cent lower to 1{ cents higher with May at $3.01a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with May at $2.11{a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with May at $1.63} abushel; soybeans were 4\ cents to 7{ cents lower with May at $6.50\a bushel.
