The officials described the 2-week-old desert war in easternChad as an internal conflict, contradicting claims by Chad'sgovernment that the rebels are mercenaries backed by Libya andSudan.   Libya and Sudan deny involvement.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Daniel Bernard said both governmentand rebels suffered significant casualties. Without giving figures,he said government losses were ``notable.''   Another French authority, speaking on condition of anonymity,talked of the seriousness of the rebel challenge. The source saidthere appeared no overt Libyan or Sudanese role in the fighting.   The daily Le Figaro said 1,270 troops were killed by rebels inone battle.   It said rebels led by Habre's former military adviser, IdrissDeby, massacred a column of Chadian troops in bloody weekendfighting. Habre had gone to the front to take personal command ofhis troops and almost was captured in fighting along the borderwith Sudan, according to Le Figaro.   Chad's information minister, Adoum Moussa Seif, said Tuesdaythat Habre was in the capital, N'Djamena. He refused comment onreports that the president had gone to the front.   Chad's embassy in Paris said Habre was ``in complete control ofthe political and military situation throughout the country.''   Le Figaro said the rebels trapped a mechanized column of 5,000troops near Iriba.   With loyalist forces bogged down in a minefield, guerrillas ofDeby's Patriotic Salvation Movement opened fire with heavy machineguns and anti-tank rockets, killing 1,270 men, Le Figaro said.   Surviving government forces fled, Le Figaro quoted the rebels assaying, leaving behind 20 destroyed armored vehicles, 200 lighttrucks equipped with machine guns, and 12 heavy trucks.   Among the captured vehicles were two air-conditioned commandcars apparently belonging to Habre, Le Figaro said.   The reports could not be independently confirmed, but were themost detailed since renewed fighting in the Chad civil war brokeout Nov. 10.   Government radio claimed Monday that loyalist troops had retakenthe towns of Iriba, Guereda and Adre, but the rebels claimedvictories at Iriba and Tine.   Chad claims that Libya supports the insurgents. Libya denies it,claiming th problems is among Chadians.   Deby, who helped Habre take power in 1982, was accused in April1989 of involvement in a coup plot and fled to Sudan.   Libya, which once occupied the northern half of the country,signed a peace treaty with Chad in 1989, despite an outstandingborder dispute.   France maintains a force of about 1,000 soldiers in Chad as partof a defense agreement with its former colony. About half thetroops are deployed in Abeche, about 150 miles south of the combatzone.   Bernard said France has no intentions of entering the conflict.   The rebels are based in Sudan's sparsely populated Darfurprovince in Sudan, over which Sudanese authorities exercise littleControl.</TEXT></DOC>
