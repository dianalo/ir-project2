John Heinz, R-Pa., to head the SocialSecurity Administration.   King, currently an executive with a Washington consulting firm,had no comment on the announcement except to say that she was``delighted'' the president had selected her.   Bush also announced that he will nominate Allan B. Clark Sr. tobe an assistant secretary of veterans affairs. He is now head of areal estate firm in Austin, Tex.   The White House announced the nominations from Paris, where Bushis attending a seven-nation economic summit.   If confirmed by the Senate, King would succeed Dorcas Hardy asSocial Security commissioner. Hardy, who had lobbied to keep thejob, resigned last month.   King was senior legislative assistant to Heinz and headedPennsylvania's Washington office for Attorney General DickThornburgh when he was governor. She later served under PresidentReagan as deputy assistant for intergovernmental affairs.   She is currently an executive vice president of the Washingtongovernment relations firm of Gogol andamp; Associates.   King would take over an agency that currently spends some $283billion a year, only $10 billion or so less than the DefenseDepartment, the government's biggest spender. The Social SecurityAdministraion saw its workforce cut about 20 percent during theReagan administration, from about 80,000 employees to about 65,000.   The agency has come under fire from labor and some Democrats inCongress who say the agency's new services, including a toll-freetelephone information number, have been implemented poorly, and itsservice to the public has been deteriorating.   Hardy, however, says that during her three years she modernizedSocial Security's massive computer operations, made informationeasier to get and started providing to all workers Social Securitybenefit estimates upon request.   Hardy will leave July 31. She plans to host a weekly syndicatedtelevision program about personal finances.</TEXT></DOC>
