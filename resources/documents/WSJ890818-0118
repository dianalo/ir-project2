But one American-style institution created by the shah was left intact: a nonprofit foundation set up here and endowed with a 36-story Fifth Avenue office building.    Individuals sympathetic to the new revolutionary regime seized control of the foundation, and critics say they have quietly been funneling millions of dollars to supporters of the late ayatollah in the U.S. The supporters, the critics say, include Iranian students at U.S. universities and a religious group in the Washington, D.C., area whose followers distribute literature extolling the Iranian regime and joined the late ayatollah in attacking author Salman Rushdie's book &quot;Satanic Verses.&quot;    Although renamed the Mostazafan (Arabic for oppressed) Foundation when control shifted to the friends of Iran's fundamentalist regime, there has been another side to the organization's activities. As the owner of the $100 million office building at the corner of East 52nd Street, it's involved in plenty of American-style capitalism and marketing. It belongs to the Fifth Avenue Association, which includes such pillars of the local retailing establishment as Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue and Tiffany.    The Mostazafan Foundation often acts like one of Manhattan's snobbish landlords. Earlier this year, it refused to rent retail space to a men's clothing chain on the ground the would-be tenant was nothing but a &quot;bargain-basement mass retailer.&quot; The foundation said retail space is reserved for &quot;sophisticated tenants.&quot;    Now, the group is battling with Electronique, a ground-floor electronics shop, which has had the audacity to use price tags in a window display. The foundation, in a lawsuit, says price tags cheapen the building, and got a judge to ban them.    One former tenant with Wall Street connections is convicted stock manipulator Ivan Boesky. Other current tenants are far more respectable, including the securities firms of PaineWebber and Shearson Lehman Hutton.    Wherever it got its investment advice, the foundation was luckier than some in the pre-crash U.S. market. Its financial reports show it unloaded all of its stock holdings in the months before the 1987 crash. The portfolio -- including 300 Walt Disney shares and 200 CBS Inc. shares -- was sold off for a total of $676,323, or a 2.6% net loss.    The 28 tenants in the building paid a total of $14 million in rent during 1988, according to the latest available reports filed by the Mostazafan Foundation. The organization doled out all of the $2.8 million it had left after paying the building's expenses. Since the foundation has a mortgage on the building ($45 million from Iran's Bank Melli), the group, which is chartered as a nonprofit corporation in New York state, says it has to pay U.S. taxes on its rental income.    The organization also says it complies with other U.S. regulations, which bar foundations from promoting political causes. &quot;We have no political attitude toward Iran,&quot; says Mohammad Badr-Taleh, the foundation's $48,000-a-year president. &quot;We don't propagate or distribute literature for or against the Iran government.&quot;    &quot;The foundation has a close abiding connection with the Iran government,&quot; says a U.S. government official. &quot;Everything I've seen shows that.&quot;    Opponents of the current Iranian regime press this point. A spokesman for Peoples Mojahedin of Iran, a Washington-based organization, says, &quot;To get money from the foundation, students have to be staunch supporters of the Iran regime. If you're critical, no money.&quot; The foundation says such charges are baseless, and that scholarship funds are awarded only to top-flight students. &quot;They must be B-plus or better,&quot; a foundation official says. &quot;If they do badly, no more funds.&quot;    One of the chief beneficiaries of the foundation is the Islamic Education Center, which is located in Potomac, Md., outside Washington, D.C. The facility is a gathering place for Muslim supporters of Iran who appear to have both religious and political objectives. Since 1981, the foundation has spent more than $4 million for buildings, land and improvements for the center.    A militant Muslim group -- at no cost -- uses the foundation-supported facility as a mosque, or place of worship. In fiscal 1988 the foundation gave the mosque $230,000 to help cover operating expenses, including the salary of Mohammad Asi, the mosque's controversial leader. Earlier this year, the Asi group celebrated at the center the regime's rise to power in 1979, and honored Ayatollah Khomeini in a memorial service. Literature praising the Iranian regime is offered at the mosque's bookstore, according to a representative of the rival Islamic Center.    The Islamic Center representative shows a reporter a booklet that he says was distributed nearby by the Asi group, shortly after Ayatollah Khomeini decreed that Mr. Rushdie, the author, should be killed because his novel assertedly blasphemes Muslims.    The booklet says in part: &quot;The whole affair goes beyond Rushdie's foul and filthy language, it is looming as an international plot premeditatedly patronized by world Zionism and imperialism to smear the Prophet's image.&quot;    Mr. Asi says, &quot;I don't know if such an incident {distribution of the booklet} took place. If it did, we were clarifying the issue of blasphemy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
