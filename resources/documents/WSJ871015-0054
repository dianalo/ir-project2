Milton Smith, 52 years old, who serves as chief executive officer, was named to the additional post of president, succeeding George P. O'Leary. C.N. Winningstad, 61, currently vice chairman, was named chairman, succeeding Mr. Smith in that position.    The 17-year-old company, a pioneer in scientific computing, created the minisupercomputer but has recently yielded ground to aggressive newcomers. The past year has been clouded by losses, personnel cuts and the erosion of the company's market position. In the fiscal third quarter, ended July 31, the company had a loss of $12.4 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $2 million. Revenue declined to $18.3 million from $20.8 million. The company has blamed slower than expected sales.    Mr. O'Leary, 45, had served Floating Point for years as vice president of engineering and as vice president of international operations. He resigned in 1981 but was brought back a year ago to be president.    A company spokeswoman said Mr. O'Leary had been hired as president to focus on product development. &quot;His tenure was culminated in the hiring of Lance Johnson, our product development vice president,&quot; she said. &quot;(Mr. O'Leary's) job was completed.&quot;    In a telephone interview, Mr. Winningstad said Mr. O'Leary's position had been considered temporary from the start and now his &quot;task was complete.&quot; He added that both he and Mr. Smith consider themselves also to be filling their new posts on an acting basis, but amid current troubles &quot;qualified people haven't exactly been beating a path to our door.&quot;    Neither Mr. O'Leary nor Mr. Smith could be reached for comment.    Floating Point stock closed yesterday at $8.24, down 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Mr. Winningstad currently serves as chairman and chief executive officer of Lattice Semiconductor Corp., Beaverton, and will retain those positions.    The company spokeswoman said Messrs. Smith and Winningstad, who helped found Floating Point, have worked together in various high-technology ventures for 28 years. </TEXT></DOC>
