The Energy Foundation, whose initial endowment will be $20million over three years, is a joint initiative of the JohnD. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the RockefellerFoundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts. It will be based inSan Francisco.</LP><TEXT>   The organization, which will award grants to nonprofitgroups to develop more effective energy policies andpractices, probably will continue to exist beyond the initialthree years, Hal Harvey, executive director, said. Thefoundation may commission research and sponsor conferences topromote energy efficiency and renewable energy, and it willparticipate in training and education, although it doesn'tplan to support laboratory research.   The focus of the Energy Foundation will be on electricutilities and industry, buildings, transportation, renewableenergy -- which is produced from wind, solar, geothermal andother such sources -- and integrated issues, or policies thattranscend all sectors. The foundation differentiates itselffrom other groups by concentrating solely on energy issues asthey relate to economics, the environment and internationalsecurity.   Some of the ideas the foundation is considering includeways to make mortgage programs more sensitive to long-termenergy costs and cost-benefit analyses for bringing newlighting technologies into business places. Mr. Harvey saidthese technologies can help cut lighting use 50% to 75% andare &quot;as profound as the computer revolution.&quot; Otherpossibilities include doing a thermal analysis of federalgovernment buildings to show how energy could be saved andcosts cut.   The foundation says it has been estimated that the U.S.could save one-third to one-half of the $450 billion a yearnow spent on energy in the country.</TEXT></DOC>
