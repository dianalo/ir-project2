Eight ministers of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries were scheduled to begin talks Wednesday at cartelheadquarters in Vienna.   Subroto, secretary-general of the 13-nation organization, toldreporters last week that the ministers _ members of a monitoringcommittee _ would review the market and make certain the new accordwas working well.   The cartel agreed last November on a new quota system limitingeach member's output in the first half of this year in an attemptto support a price of $18 a barrel. The overall production levelwas set at 18.5 million barrels a day, well under the actual outputat year's end.   Many analysts had been skeptical the OPEC countries would complywith their quotas, but now say most nations generally have mettheir targets.   ``They've done better adhering to (their quotas) than most hadexpected,'' said Fergus MacLeod, oil analyst at Barclays de ZoeteWedd in London.   ``Prices have looked amazingly good,'' he said.   The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by OPECreaching $17.50 a barrel last week, up more than $5 from lateNovember when the output deal was struck.   In U.S. futures trading, the May contract for West TexasIntermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, was up 45 cents at $20.60 abarrel Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   Although Monday's price was inflated by speculation stemmingfrom the closing of the Alaskan pipeline at Valdez due to a majoroffshore oil spill, it still reflected the crude's sharp surge fromthe two-year low of $12.60 reached last Oct. 5.   Subroto said, ``My feeling is that there seems to be a bullishexpectation in the market to see a strong price level. So we willenter the second quarter, which is usually a weak quarter, with astronger demand than had been foreseen.''   Independent producing nations also were expected to curb exportsby a total of less than 300,000 barrels daily in the April-Junequarter to support OPEC's efforts.   The Soviet Union, the world's largest crude producer, said itwould join the cuts in the second quarter, when prices generallydecline with the onset of warmer weather in oil-importing countries.   With the good wintertime results, the ministers also likely willhold initial discussions on production levels for the second halfof this year. Those quotas won't be set until a full meeting of allOPEC ministers June 5 in Vienna.   Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister, told theMiddle East Economic Survey that OPEC should boost its productionceiling by 1.5 million barrels a day to 20 million barrels in thelast six months of the year.   He said in an interview published Monday that the cartel's pricetarget should be maintained at $18 a barrel.   Since the production accord, OPEC has reported that 12 of thenations complied with the agreement in January and February bycurtailing output for the international market.   The cartel said the 12 nations pumped 17.4 million barrels ofoil a day in February, compared with the daily ceiling of 17.51million barrels set for those dozen countries.   The statement said the United Arab Emirates had not reportedsupply figures in January or February. That country persistentlyhas exceeded its daily quota of 988,000 barrels. Analysts estimateits current production at more than 1.5 million barrels a day.   Ministers who form the monitoring committee represent Algeria,Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.Other OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and the UnitedArab Emirates.</TEXT></DOC>
