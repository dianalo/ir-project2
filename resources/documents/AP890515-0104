SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New radars now being tested could help lessenthe danger of one of the nation's biggest weather-related problems:flash floods.   While the drama of tornadoes and hurricanes tends to get moreattention, ``flash floods are the major cause of weather-relateddeaths in the United States,'' reports Elbert W. Friday, thedirector of the National Weather Service.   ``They claimed over 1,800 lives in the 1970s and another 1,000so far this decade,'' he reported.   But with NEXRAD _ Next Generation Weather Radar _ that couldchange as better storm information is coupled with land analysesand computer programs in the next few years.   ``It's more than a pipe dream; the reality of NEXRAD'' is here,Rafael Bras of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whichoperates a radar similar to the new NEXRA system, told a recentmeeting of geophysicists.   ``I believe our way of predicting floods in the future willchange because our sources of data are changing,'' he said at ameeting of the American Geophysical Union in Baltimore.   Now being tested in Norman, Okla., NEXRAD could begin to beinstalled around the country by this fall, said weather servicespokesman Donald Witten.   The new radar system is expected to incorporate a computerizedprogram to warn local weather offices ``when too much rain falls intoo small an area in too short a time,'' said Witten.   Deaths from flash flooding have increased in recent years, atrend attributed to increasing development in low-lying areas nearrivers and streams.   The development of the better warning system comes just acentury after the Johnstown, Pa., flood disaster.   It was May 31, 1889 when waters of the South Fork Reservoir inwestern Pennsylvania, swollen by two days of steady rain, brokethrough an earthen dam and cascaded down the Conemaugh Valley intoJohnstown, killing at least 2,500 people.   Today, parts of flood-prone Appalachia are protected by anautomated flood warning system operated by the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration.   But while IFLOWS _ Integrated Flood Observation and WarningSystem _ covers 179 counties in seven states, flooding remains ahazard in many other areas _ too many for human forecasters to keeptrack of and issue detailed warnings.   A reorganization of the National Weather Service is expected toreduce the agency to 115 local forecast offices scattered acrossthe nation during the 1990s.   ``There might be 1,000 points of flooding for each office,'' tokeep track of, said flood analyst John Schaake of the weatherservice.   But over the next decade or so NEXRAD _ Next Generation WeatherRadar _ will be installed at those offices, and that can make thedifference, said Bras.   While current radar systems can see where storms are, NEXRADwill allow meteorologists to track wind movements and estimaterainfall over much of the area.   Bras, using similar radar at MIT, has combined the readings withdetailed analyses of water runoff and stream flow patterns in theSouhegan and Squanhacook river basins in New Hampshire in anexperiment to see if flooding can be better predicted.   First, he said, he developed detailed topographical maps of theriver basins, including estimates of the slope, to calculate ratesof runoff and the velocity of streamflows in the region.   Weather records for the area allowed him to calculate howsaturated the soil was to see how much water would be absorbed, andhow much would flow through the soil into lower-level streams andcreeks.   With all these calculations in a computer, Bras explained, hewas able to estimate the stream flows and flood heights when theadvanced radar detected storms over the two river basins. In aseries of experiments the projections came very close to actualwater levels recorded on the scene, Bras said.   Such projections could speed warnings to areas downstream ofheavy rains or sudden snowmelts, two major causes of flash floodingin the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
