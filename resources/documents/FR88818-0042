L.   98-547),amended the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1202 <T3>et seq.</T3>), by adding a new section 627 (19 U.S.C. 1627), relatingto the unlawful importation or exportation of certain vehicles and equipment.Subsequently, the Tariff Act of 1930 was further amended by section 205of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 (Pub. L.   98-573), which also addeda new section 627, similar to section 627 of Pub. L. 98-547. The amendmentsmade by Pub. L. 98-573 are set forth as 19 U.S.C. 1627a.The new sections provide for civil penalties of not more than $10,000 foreach violation of knowingly importing, exporting, or attempting to importor export (1) any stolen self-propelled vehicle, vessel or aircraft; or(2) any self-propelled vehicle or part of a self-propelled vehicle fromwhich the vehicle identification number (VIN) has been removed, obliterated,tampered with or altered. Also, any violation of 19 U.S.C. 1627 or 1627asubjects the vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or part thereof to seizure andforfeiture. In addition, any person attempting to export a used self-propelledvehicle must present both the vehicle and a document describing the vehicle,which includes the VIN, to Customs before lading if the vehicle is to betransported by vessel or aircaft, or before export if the vehicle is tobe transported by rail, highway, or under its own power. Failure to complywith this provision subjects the violator to a civil penalty of $500 foreach violation.Public Law 98-547 and Public Law  98-573 were enacted in response to theever-increasing incidents of the theft of motor vehicles and other conveyancesand their exportation from the U.S. It is estimated that approximately200,000 stolen vehicles are exported each year, primarily by professionalthieves or people employed by them to effect the exportation. The recoveryrate for stolen vehicles decreased from 86% in 1967 to 62.9% in 1984.There is also a growing problem concerning the exportation of vehicle components.The parts are often shipped in sealed containers, making detection moredifficult.The legislation concerning the exporting and importing of self-propelledvehicles, other conveyances or parts thereof with altered vehicle identificationnumbers established penalties for violations and provided for the seizureand forfeiture of the vehicles, other conveyances or parts. It is expectedthat these sanctions will both deter the exportation of stolen vehiclesand improve the recovery rate of those vehicles which are stolen. The legislationalso directed that regulations by prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasurywith regard to the procedures for the lawful exportation of used self-propelledvehicles.<ITAG tagnum="84">Prior Proposal</ITAG>On March 17, 1987, Customs published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 8308), proposing regulations to implement19 U.S.C. 1627 and 1627a. It was proposed to establish a new Part 192,Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 192).Sections 192.1 through 192.4 of Subpart A of Part 192 would set forth theprocedures for the lawful exportation of used self-propelled vehicles.They would require a person attempting to export such a vehicle to furnishdocumentation sufficient to prove to Customs that the vehicle is lawfullyowned by the exporter. This documentation would include the vehicle identificationnumber. Definitions of ``self-propelled vehicle,'' ``used,'' ``ultimatepurchaser,'' and ``export,'' all terms used in Pub. L. 98-573, would bedefined in andSection; 192.1.As proof of ownership of the vehicle by the exporter, Customs would acceptan original certificate of title, or a memorandum of ownership, or a rightof possession, or any other document sufficient to prove lawful ownership,such as a bill of sale or a sales invoice. In lieu of an original document,Customs would accept a certified copy.It was also proposed that the exporter must present 2 facsimiles of theoriginal document or certified copy. Customs would authenticate both facsimiledocuments, one of which would remain in the possession of the exporter,and the other of which will be collected by Customs for forwarding to theNational Automobile Theft Bureau (NATB), on the same day. While Customswould not retain copies of the documentation relating to the exportation,the NATB would enter the VIN and other information on the exported vehiclesinto their database for recordkeeping purposes.Authentication by Customs would include the stamping of the facsimile documentswith the date of their presentation. As to exportations at a land border,where the vehicle is to be transported by rail, highway, or under its ownpower, it was proposed that the date would most likely be the date of exportation.At sea borders, where the vehicle is to be transported by vessel, or atairports, where the vehicle is to be transported by aircraft, the dateof presentation of the facsimile documents could often precede the actualdate of exportation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>Ten comments were received in response to the original proposal. A discussionof these comments and our responses follow:<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the proposed regulationsshould be included in the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR), becausethe exporting public will be confused if export regulations are placedin the Customs Regulations (19 CFR). <T3>Response: </T3>The statute on which the proposed regulations were basedis concerned with both the importation and exportation of vehicles. Congresshas seen fit to enact the statute in title 19 of the U.S. Code. Accordingly,Customs believes that the subject regulations properly belong in the CustomsRegulations (19 CFR).<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that because 19 U.S.C. 1627 and19 U.S.C. 1627a were enacted simultaneously, currently exist side by side,and cover the same subject matter, clarification is necessary as to whichstatute is being implemented by the proposed regulations.<T3>Response: </T3>We do not agree. The legal effect of both statutes isidentical and, therefore, regulations implementing both statutes wouldbe identical.<T3>Comment: </T3>A Florida-based commenter noted that there is an overlapbetween the subject legislation and Florida State statutes. Accordingly,the commenter believed that the Federal legislation is unnecessary.<T3>Response: </T3>Customs disagrees. One intent of the legislation wasto enable Customs, which is a presence at all points of exportation, toassume part of the responsibility for curtailing the exportation of stolenvehicles. Similar state and federal requirements may co-exist as long asstate legislation does not conflict with the federal requirements.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters suggested that proposed andSection; 192.2(a),Customs Regulations, which provided that a person attempting to exporta used self-propelled vehicle, be more specific with regard to the placeof presentation of the vehicle and documentation.<T3>Response: </T3>Customs agrees. Accordingly, proposed andSection; 192.2(a)is being amended to state that presentation shall occur at the port ofexportation.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters suggested that because all 50 statesare title states with regard to automobiles, trucks, motorcycles and buses,Customs might want to require that original or certified copies of Certificatesof Title be presented for these vehicles. The possibility of forgerieswould be decreased if originals or certified copies were required.<T3>Response: </T3>We agree. Accordingly, the language in proposed andSection;192.2(b) being amended to state that in the case of automobiles, trucks,motorcycles and buses, original or certified copies of Certificates ofTitle and two facsimiles of the original or certified copy shall be presented.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that because not all vehiclesencompassed by proposed Part 192 are assigned vehicle identification numers(VINs), the proposed regulations should not categorically require thatthe document which must be presented to Customs describing the vehicleinclude the VIN.<T3>Response: </T3>We agree. Accordingly, language in the proposed regulationis being changed to state that the document presented to Customs may includethe product identification number rather than the VIN, if the vehicle forwhich the document is presented does not have a VIN.<T3>Comment: </T3>It was suggested that in order to enhance law enforcementcapabilities, the regulations provide a time lag between the presentationof the documentation evidencing lawful ownership and the actual exportationof the vehicle.<T3>Response: </T3>We agree. Proposed andSection; 192.2(c) is, accordingly,amended to provide for presentation of documents and vehicles at the portof exportation at least three days before actual exportation, regardlessof the specific mode of exportation.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that proposed andSection; 192.3,covering penalties, should be redrafted so that, in addition to attemptedexportations, it also covers actual accomplished exportations in violationof the regulatory requirements.<T3>Response: </T3>We agree. Accordingly, proposed andSection; 192.3 is expandedto state that a $500 penalty will be assessed against both an exporterwho has already exported a vehicle without complying with the requirementsset forth in Part 192 and an exporter attempting to export a vehicle withoutcomplying with the regulations.<T3>Comment: </T3>A commenter suggested that Customs be required in allcases to compare the VIN on the documentation purported to evidence lawfulownership with the number on the vehicle itself.<T3>Response: </T3>We disagree. Such a requirement would place an impossibleburden on Customs and it would not be an efficient use of our limited personnel,facilities and resources.<T3>Comment: </T3>It was suggested that the regulations specify the contentsof the authentication.<T3>Response: </T3>Customs disagrees. We believe that the content of theauthentication is basically on operational issue and that, therefore, theregulations need not set forth the specifics of the authentication.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters stated that Customs should be requiredto send the VIN to an agency that maintains data on stolen vehicles suchas the NCIC (the FBI's National Crime Information Center) through a directcomputer hook-up.<T3>Response: </T3>Customs might do this. However, we believe that theregulations should not contain any specific requirements regarding whatCustoms will do with the information it obtains. It is necessary for theagency to maintain flexibility in this area.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>After careful consideration of all the comments received and further reviewof the matter, it has been determined to republish the proposal with themodifications noted and to allow interested persons an additional opportunityto submit comments on the proposal. Commenters on the original proposalneed not resubmit their comments. They will be reconsidered along withany new comments received in response to this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>Before adopting this proposal, consideration will be given to any writtencomments (preferably in triplicate) that are submitted timely to Customs.Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordancewith the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), andSection; 1.4, TreasuryDepartment Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)), on regular business days betweenthe hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Regulations and DisclosureLaw Branch, Room 2324, Customs Headquarters, 1301 Constitution Avenue,NW., Washington, DC 20229.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq</T3>.), it is certified that, if adopted, the proposed amendmentswill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. Accordingly, they are not subject to the regulatory analysisor other requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The collection of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemakinghas been submitted to the Office of Management of Budget (OMB) for reviewin accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)).Comments on the collection of information should be sent to the Officeof Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,Washington, DC 20503, attention: Desk Officer for U.S. Customs Service,with copies to the U.S. Customs Service at the address previously specified.The collection of information in the regulation is in section 19 CFR 192.2.This information is required by Customs pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1627 and1627a to prove that used self-propelled vehicles that are being exportedout of the U.S. are lawfully owned by the exporter. Customs will be providingthe documentation it collects certifying the exporters' ownership of theexported vehicles to the National Automobile Theft Bureau which would maintainthe records. The likely respondents are individuals exporting vehicles,business or other for-profit organizations and small businesses or organizations.<T3>Estimated total annual reporting and/or recordkeeping burden: </T3>5333hours.<T3>Estimated average annual burden per respondent and/or recordkeepers:</T3>2\1/2\ hours depending on the circumstances.<T3>Estimated number of respondents and recordkeepers: </T3>2000<T3>Estimated annual frequency of responses: </T3>16.Part 178, Customs Regulations (19 CFR Part 178), which lists the informationcollections contained in the regulations and control numbers assigned byOMB would be amended accordingly if this proposal is adopted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of this document was Harold M.
