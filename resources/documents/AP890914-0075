At 6 a.m. EDT, Hugo's center was located near 13.0 north latitudeand 48.0 west longitude, or about 900 miles east of the LesserAntilles. The storm was moving west at 17 mph, down from 20 mphWednesday night.   Its highest sustained winds were just over the 74 mph hurricanethreshold, but the storm was expected to strengthen, forecasterssaid. Hugo was expected to hold its course today.   ``The threat to the islands is kind of delayed some,'' saidforecaster Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center in suburbanCoral Gables. ``A lot of our model forecasts indicate it's going toslow down even more in the next couple of days.''   Hugo, the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season,developed into a hurricane Wednesday evening. Storms are given nameswhen their sustained winds reach 39 mph, the tropical stormthreshold.   ``The longer it heads west, the more concern it is to us,'' saidHal Gerrish, a forecaster at the hurricane center. ``But we're notsure yet where it will go _ there are too many things that canhappen.''   The three Atlantic hurricanes before Hugo _ Dean, Erin andGabrielle _ turned north into the open Atlantic before reaching theCaribbean. But last year's killer Hurricane Gilbert remained on thewestward course, socking Mexico and the Caribbean.   They became storms when sustained winds reached 39 mph, and reachhurricanes status when winds hit 74 mph.</TEXT></DOC>
