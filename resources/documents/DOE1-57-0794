When the renal tubular damage progresses, the excretionof amino acids, especially, threonine, hydroxyproline, proline, citrulline,ornithine, arginine increased in urine. It has been reported that theincrease in urinary excretion of citrulline, arginine and ornithine maybe associated with an inhibition of urea synthesis in the urea cycle.The authors have found that serum citrulline, arginine and ornithinealso increased in I disease patients. In order to investigate the mechanismof the increase in these serum amino acids, comparative studies wereperformed using both healthy subjects and patients with renal diseaseas control groups.</TEXT></DOC>
