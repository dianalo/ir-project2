<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-86-1438 </DOCNO><TEXT>The effect of an intense electromagnetic field on auto-ionization resonancesin an atom is considered in the case when the atom possesses N closelydistributed discrete levels below the first ionization threshold whichare in multiphoton resonance with the ground level and with M auto-ionizationabove the threshold. The multilevel structure of the discrete state mayeither consist of many close levels of the highly excited atomic statesor of a multiplet. The possibility of narrowing of the resonances dependingon the intensity and frequency of the external field is investigated.Emission of the third harmonic is considered.</TEXT></DOC>
