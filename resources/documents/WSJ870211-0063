Cecola, who was accused of playing a minor role in the Dennis Levine insider-trading case, was sentenced to six years' probation for filing false tax returns that the government said was part of his role in the case.    Mr. Cecola, 25 years old, who had earlier settled Securities and Exchange Commission charges of trading on and disclosing confidential information he learned while working at Lazard Freres andamp; Co., also received two concurrent but suspended five-year prison terms. U.S. District Judge Peter K. Leisure noted that prosecutors hadn't charged Mr. Cecola with insider trading in the criminal case and instead had settled on his admitting to the tax counts.    Mr. Cecola was a junior financial analyst at Lazard from late 1983 to 1985. His attorney noted that Mr. Cecola was recently forced to withdraw from Harvard Business School because of his association with the Levine scandal.    Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Gerard L. Goettel yesterday set a sentencing date of Feb. 18 for Mr. Levine. Mr. Levine's sentencing had been delayed for seven months as the government debriefed him in connection with its continuing probe.    The Levine case led to the $100 million insider-trading settlement with arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky, who has also agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge.    At his sentencing in federal court, Mr. Cecola said his case had been &quot;humbling and painful,&quot; especially his ouster from Harvard.    &quot;My family and I were mortified at Harvard's decision to request my withdrawal from their program,&quot; Mr. Cecola said.    In December, Mr. Cecola pleaded guilty to two criminal counts of filing false tax returns related to $66,342 in unreported trading profits made in an account at Lazard in a friend's name. The criminal charges didn't mention the Levine case and Mr. Cecola has denied violating insider-trading laws.    However, the separate SEC civil charges in December accused Mr. Cecola of participating in the Levine ring through Robert M. Wilkis, a former Lazard investment banker who Monday was sentenced to a year and a day in prison for his major role in the Levine scheme. Mr. Cecola, without admitting or denying the SEC charges, agreed to surrender $21,800 representing trading profits.    The judge noted that prosecutors, who referred to an alleged insider-trading agreement between Messrs. Cecola and Wilkis in pre-sentencing papers, hadn't sought to prove their claim in court.    In fact, Judge Leisure said, Lazard officials wrote him to support Mr. Cecola, describing his crimes as only &quot;technical violations&quot; of Lazard rules on options trading.    Alan Kaufman, Mr. Cecola's attorney, said Mr. Cecola was &quot;the lowest man on the proverbial totem pole&quot; in the Levine case, &quot;even assuming he belongs on that pole at all.&quot;    Mr. Cecola could have been sentenced to as long as six years in prison and fined as much as $500,000 on the tax charges. </TEXT></DOC>
