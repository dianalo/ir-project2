These are among predictions _ both dire and encouraging _ made byscientists and forecasters writing for ``The Futurist,'' themagazine of the World Future Society.   Each year the non-profit scientific and educational associationpublishes a compilation of some 70 forecasts of the future in suchfields as world population, the environment, international business,education, health, technology and the work force.   Among the predictions for 1989 and beyond:   _By the end of the century, AIDS, or acquired immune deficiencysyndrome, could have the impact of a world war, with total deathsworldwide amounting to 50 million in the 1990s _ more than the BlackDeath plague of the 14th century. Also, the incurable disease isunlikely to spread rapidly in America's heterosexual population.   _Most heart bypass operations will be eliminated by the year 2000in favor of less intrusive procedures or clot-dissolving drugs.   _The United States will have a shortage of 1.2 million nurses bythe year 2000.   _Robots will replace only a tiny fraction of the estimated 131million people in the U.S. labor force by 1997. For every workingrobot, there will still be more than 400 people working.   _Computers will become an increasingly popular target forterrorists. Attacks on high-tech targets such as computer networks,telecommunications facilities or defense computers could pose amajor threat to industrialized nations.   _Automobiles will be guided by remote control on ``electronichighways.'' Traffic lights and gates tied to a central computer willcontrol access and movement. Drivers will receive information ontraffic flow and parking availability on digital display screens ineach car.   _Future wars may be fought on supercomputers. A military leadermay capitulate after receiving an unfavorable computer readout fromhis forecast staff rather than undertake a bloody battle.   _Adults may soon constitute a majority of the U.S. collegestudent population. People over 25 accounted for 30 percent ofstudent enrollment in 1972; half the college population will likelyconsist of adults by 1992.   _Many homes will be protected by relatively inexpensive lasershields and artificial-intelligence home security systems within 20years. Surveillance by satellite and light-sensitive monitors maysoon be feasible.   _More species will disappear during this century than havedisappeared at any period since the age of the dinosaurs. As theextinction rate of animals increases, zoos may increasingly become``Noah's Archives'' _ preservers of the world's species.   _Worldwide sea levels will rise over the next century at a fasterrate than ever before, due to the warming of the earth's atmospherecaused by the greenhouse effect. Permanent coastal structures suchas airports with runways built on reclaimed land will faceincreasing threats of flooding.   The greenhouse effect may benefit agriculture, however. Wheat,rice and corn _ the planet's three major foods _ increase inproductivity in environments enriched by carbon dioxide.Unfortunately, so do weeds.   _The global energy crisis of the 1970s may return in the 1990s.Worldwide dependence on Middle Eastern and OPEC oil is increasingand may exceed 1973 levels by the turn of the century. Geothermalenergy could meet U.S. energy needs at current consumption levelsfor the next 600 years.   _Economic trade rivalry between the United States and Japan couldlead to trade wars. Japanese control of the most advancedsemi-conductor technology by the early 1990s may further erode U.S.economic strength, leading to a reduction of U.S. militarydeployment and security commitments in the Pacific and elsewhere.</TEXT></DOC>
