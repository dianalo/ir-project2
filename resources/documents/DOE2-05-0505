First, an equation for the quantity circularintegraldl/B is derived, and then the new equilibrium is obtained asa special solution to this non-linear equation. The current and pressureprofiles are everywhere smooth, and they exhibit a more well-definedboundary than those of the Bennett equilibrium do.</TEXT></DOC>
