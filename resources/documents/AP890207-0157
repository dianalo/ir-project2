RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The American Bar Association, without endorsingsurrogate motherhood, offered states a blueprint Tuesday forlegalizing the practice and making surrogacy contracts enforceable.   The ABA's House of Delegates, its policy-making body, approved byvoice vote a resolution offering states a proposed model act forlegalizing surrogacy.   But the resolution also contained an alternative model that wouldbar enforcement of contracts in which a so-called surrogate motheris paid to bear a child and then give up any claim to her offspring.   The 330,000-member ABA, the nation's largest organization oflawyers, chose to adopt a resolution with conflicting options toavoid going on record in favor of surrogacy.   But opponents of the resolution insisted the measure would makeit appear the ABA supports the controversial practice.   ``This is a mechanism to buy and sell children,'' said KurtMelchior, a San Francisco lawyer who opposed the resolution. ``Ourbasic constitutional and humanistic principles are being deeplyoffended here.''   The surrogacy proposal was adopted as the ABA concluded itsannual mid-winter convention.   Michael P. Sullivan of Minneapolis, a chief sponsor of thesurrogacy resolution, said the ABA must recognize that suchcontracts are being made in many states and offer guidance tolawmakers.   ``In dealing with the new biology, you can't put your head in thesand,'' he said. Sullivan said his main interest was in assuringuniformity among those states that choose to make surrogacy legal.   Proponents of the measure said surrogacy is a boon to the 15percent of married couples that are infertile and unable to adoptbecause of a shortage of babies put up for adoption.   In the surrogacy case that attracted the most nationwideattention, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled in 1988 that surrogatemotherhood for money violates the state's adoption laws.   The state court voided a surrogacy contract but awarded custodyof the child _ referred to as Baby M _ to its biological father andhis wife.   Baby M's biological mother, Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, wonunsupervised visitation rights.   The ruling fueled rather than resolved the debate over surrogacy.   The resolution adopted by the ABA proposed that those stateslegalizing surrogate contracts should limit them to agreementsbetween a married couple and a surrogate mother. The husband seekingthe contract would have to donate his sperm or his wife would haveto contribute the egg to establish a genetic tie between the babyand one of the parents.   The agreement would be approved by a judge before conception andthere would have to be proof that the wife seeking to acquire thebaby is unable to bear a child herself, the resolution said.   Also, the surrogate mother would have 180 days after the child isconceived to repudiate the contract and keep the baby. After 180days, the couple that signed the contract to acquire the child wouldbecome its legal parents.   The ABA also unanimously adopted a resolution calling forincreased funding of the federal Legal Services Corporation.   The resolution, which criticized the former Reagan administrationfor cutting back legal services to the poor, urged President Bush toname Legal Services Corporation directors who are committed tohelping the poor.</TEXT></DOC>
