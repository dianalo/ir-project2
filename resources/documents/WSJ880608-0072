After two days of the planned three-day action, called to protest state-of-emergency restrictions and amendments to the Labor Relations Act, both sides were calling into question future attempts to settle disagreements through negotiation. Labor leaders intensified their attacks on employers for supporting the proposed legislation that would outlaw sympathy strikes and make unions liable for damages suffered in illegal strikes. For their part, employer organizations charged the unions are subverting the collective-bargaining process with politically oriented work stoppages.    &quot;Labor relations are in for a difficult year,&quot; said Vincent Brett, the manpower secretary of the Associated Chambers of Commerce. &quot;Employer attitudes are getting harder and harder. They are getting thoroughly fed up with stayaways.&quot; He said many employers are threatening to respond with stricter disciplinary action, such as selective dismissals.    &quot;When you shut down a guy's factory for three days, it's to be expected that the employer will turn into an enemy of the unions rather than an ally,&quot; said Bobby Godsell, the labor relations director at Anglo American Corp., the giant mining and finance house.    Jay Naidoo, the general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, or Cosatu, also warned of a rocky future. &quot;If the employers continue with their threats, the whole process of negotiation will be impossible,&quot; he said.    Although support for the work stoppage began eroding yesterday, as some workers who took off Monday returned to their jobs, Mr. Naidoo said the protest has accomplished its purpose. &quot;It has demonstrated the extent of the resentment and anger generated by the emergency restrictions and the labor relations amendment,&quot; he said.    The main setback for union organizers, however, has been the low level of participation by the mineworkers. None of the gold mines was even mildly affected, and only a few of the coal mines were hit. Officials of the National Union of Mineworkers, the largest black union, said the emergency restrictions hindered their ability to hold meetings on the mines and organize the protest.    &quot;The gold mines have been a disappointment,&quot; a NUM official said. &quot;You can never claim a success in a stayaway if the gold boys don't come out.&quot; He worries that the lack of participation in the stoppage may weaken NUM's position in the current contract negotiations with the mine owners. Last year, the mineworkers waged a three-week strike over wages.    Cosatu, the country's largest labor federation with nearly 700,000 members, estimated that three million workers heeded the protest call on Monday, with 2.5 million participating yesterday. An independent labor-monitoring group pegged Monday's stoppage figure at about two million. The most-successful areas were Johannesburg and the surrounding industrial towns, and the port city of Durban. On Monday, more than 80% of the workers stayed home in these areas, while yesterday about 60% did. In addition, many schools and black-owned shops were closed down.    Cosatu's call for three days of &quot;peaceful protest&quot; -- it is illegal to openly call for strikes or boycotts -- was supported by the other major trade federation, the National Council of Trade Unions, and by many religious and community leaders. The extent of the stoppage indicates that despite the emergency restrictions, anti-apartheid organizations are still able to mobilize mass action. This was the first show of strength since 18 opposition organizations, including Cosatu, were banned from political activities in February. Union leaders say the three-day stayaway is the longest in the country's history.    For the most part, the protest has been peaceful. Police reported that eight people have died in political violence during the time of the stoppage, but it couldn't be determined if the unrest was directly connected to the protest. In addition, a number of people have been injured during scattered violence at train and bus terminals where people going to work would gather. There have been several explosions at train stations in Soweto, the large black township near Johannesburg.    &quot;The protest call has been very effective,&quot; Mr. Brett of the Associated Chambers of Commerce conceded. &quot;They called for three days and they'll get three days.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
