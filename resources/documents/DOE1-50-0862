CH{sub 2}OH radicals, radiolytically generated,transfer electrons to ZnO particles. The electrons are long-lived andcause a substantial blue shift of the absorption spectrum of ZnO in awavelength range of 60 nm below the threshold. The wavelength of maximumbleaching is shifted to shorter wavelengths with decreasing particlesize (size quantization effect). Maximum bleaching occurs with a negativeabsorption coefficient of 1.1 x 10{sup 5} M{sup -1} cm{sup -1}. Electronsare also stored upon UV illumination of colloidal ZnO. The stored electronsreact rather slowly with oxygen, the rate constant becoming lower withincreasing particle size, and more rapidly with peroxy radicals.</TEXT></DOC>
