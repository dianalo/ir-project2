V-COM hardware redirector, $99; V-COM, MicroChannel version, $149.andM;Requires: PC/XT/AT or compatible computer; server: 45K RAM plus memory forbuffers determined by user; workstation: 48K RAM.andM;In Short: Omnitel's ACS offers exceptional flexibility in a nondedicatedsystem, giving you a choice of serial ports and internal modems on the serverand allowing you to use either INT 14 or standard communications software.andO;But the Omnitel simply hasn't the horsepower to keep up with the dedicatedsystems, especially when loaded with more than four ports.andM;Omnitel ACS SystemandM;Unlike the other nondedicated systems reviewed here, Omnitel's ACS Systemallows you to mix and match to suit your needs.andP;  On the server end, you canchoose either serial ports or Hayes-compatible internal modems in groups offour, up to a maximum of 16 ports per server.andP;  And at the workstation end,Omnitel supports a wide range of software through both hardware- andsoftware-based redirector options.andP;  But it still suffers from the relativelylow performance of a nondedicated unit.andM;Omnitel's four-port serial board has no on-board processor.andP;  An octupus cableplugs into a large connector on the rear of the board and supplies four maleDB-25 connectors at the other end.andP;  The modem board, which comes in2,400-bit-per-second and 1,200-bps versions, contains four Hayes-compatiblemodems on a single full-length card.andP;  Due to the tight space on the card, nospeakers are included.andM;The Omnitel server software runs in the background under DOS, so you can runother applications on the communications server.andP;  Configuring the server foreight ports, however, requires 128K of memory over and above that required toload DOS and NetBIOS.andP;  Even on a 640K machine, this doesn't really allow muchRAM workspace for running lcoal applications.andM;Moreover, since the server software eats up most of the available CPU timeeven on a 10-MHz 80286 system, you are probably better off running it as adedicated communications server.andP;  Unfortunately, Omnitel has not found a wayto make the server softwre of a foreground task receiving 100 percent of theprocessor's attention.andP;  Omnitel, however, does include a monitor program thatruns in the foreground and gives a nice display of the status of each of theeight ports.andM;FREEDOM OF CHOICEandM;Installing the server software is straightforward.andP;  You copy the ACS files tothe hard disk on the machine that will become the communications server andthen use a setup program to tell the server software what type of multiportserial boards you have.andP;  You can designate each port on the server as eithera modem or a direct connection.andP;  This kind of addressing makes it easy to mixdifferent kinds of serial devices on the same communications server.andM;Like Jandamp;L Products, Omnitel gives you a choice of a software-based redirectorthat works with communications packages supporting INT 14 or a hardwareredirector card (called the V-COM card) that works with standard PCcommunications software.andP;  The V-COM card is a half-size unit that you pluginto an 8-bit expansion slot in the workstation, after setting DIP switchesto select the DOS communication port (COM1 through COM4) to which the V-COMwill correspond.andM;To use the server, you simply run a program (VCOM) to select a free port,then start your communications software.andP;  You can use the setup program toconfigure VCOM for any number of workstations, referring to individualconfigurations by number when starting the workstation.andP;  Thus on any onenetwork, some users may use the V-COM card while others are using the INT 14interface.andP;  The only inconvenience is that the VCOM settings can't be changedonce the program is loaded.andP;  If you make a mistake and load the wrongconfiguration for your workstation, you must reboot it.andM;NEITHER FISH NOR FOWLandM;Weighting against the Omnitelhs flexibility and wealth of features is itsweak performance.andM;The Omnitel board's lack of an independent processor to manage thecommunications traffic is immediately apparent.andP;  With this design, all theserial ports must share the same interrupt line, and the server's CPU has tocheck all eight ports each time a character comes in, which puts quite aburden on it.andP;  Performance was acceptable with the four-modem boardinstalled, but deteriorated noticeably when the four-port serial board wasadded.andM;Like the other nondedicated systems, we noticed a considerable amount of echodelay when typing to a host computer at 9,600 bps.andP;  Not surprisingly, theOmnitel performed relatively slowly on our CompuServe download benchmarktest, clocking in at 50 characters per second (cps) compared with the 228 cpsattained by the dedicated 4P6 system.andM;The Omnitel is much more flexible than the other nondedicated systems, but itis also more expensive.andP;  If your needs are fairly modest (no more than fourports) and you have to use standard communications software, the Omnitel maybe for you.andP;  But it's no substitute for a dedicated unit, and if you justwant to share a few modems occasionally, you may be able to get what you wantfor less.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
