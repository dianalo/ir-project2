Separately, Japan said it would lodge a formal complaint with GATT if the U.S. proceeds with plans to impose punitive 100% tariffs tomorrow on $300 million of Japanese electronic goods. The Japanese announcement had been expected. The U.S. plans to impose the sanctions because it believes Japan has failed to fulfill the two nations' semiconductor agreement, which is meant to regulate Japanese sales of computer chips.    The moves emphasize the importance semiconductors have assumed as friction increases among the U.S., the EC and Japan over Japan's huge trade surplus.    The decision to form an investigating panel that will examine the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact came after the GATT council chairman, Alan Oxley, who is Australia's ambassador to GATT, forged a compromise among the parties, a GATT source said.    After negotiations that lasted until the opening of yesterday's council session, Japan dropped its resistance to the panel's formation in return for assurances from the U.S. that it would also accept the creation of a panel, according to the source.    Both countries have denied that their agreement violates GATT regulations on free trade. The five-year pact requires the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry to monitor the prices of Japanese semiconductor sales to other countries, and calls for U.S. semiconductor makers to receive a larger share of the Japanese market.    The GATT action won't deter the Reagan administration from going through with its proposed sanctions against Japan. U.S. trade officials are preparing a list of the specific Japanese electronics products to be subject to the punitive tariffs. The officials said President Reagan will announce the list tomorrow in California, where he is on vacation.    Among the products that could be penalized are black-and-white and color televisions, audio and video magnetic tapes, high-resolution computer monitors, and computer disc drives.    The EC has specifically complained about the pact's provision for price monitoring by Japan. It also cites its concerns about ensuring &quot;nondiscriminatory access to the Japanese market for semiconductors.&quot;    Aside from complaining to the GATT, the EC Commission said last week that it is pursuing an investigation into possible dumping of some types of computer memory chips in Europe. The EC imports about 59% of the semiconductors it uses -- 24% of that amount comes from the U.S. and 11% from Japan.    While Japan still believes the EC complaint is unfounded, it agreed to accept a panel out of respect for the international trade agreement, Yuji Ikeda, minister of the Japanese GATT mission in Geneva, said.    As for the U.S., it agreed to the panel's formation after the council accepted its request for a direct role in the inquiry, the U.S. ambassador to GATT, Michael Samuels, said.    Although the U.S. believes &quot;there's no good reason&quot; for the panel, Mr. Samuels said, it agreed to its creation after the GATT council decided the U.S. could be present at all the panel's hearings and make its views known.    GATT officials said the members of the panel -- which is usually made up of the representatives of three nations -- haven't yet been named. They will focus specifically on the EC's charges, then report back with its findings and recommendations.    Separately, yesterday, the EC Commission said it is launching an investigation of possible Japanese dumping of electronic printers on the EC market. The announcement of the investigation had been expected.    EC investigators will focus on Japanese exports of daisy-wheel and microdot printers to EC countries, a market currently valued at $1.3 billion. Japanese exporters account for about $1 billion currently.    An EC spokesman said the case may be the largest investigation of possible dumping by Japanese manufacturers ever launched by the EC. </TEXT></DOC>
