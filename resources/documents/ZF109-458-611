 Quarterdeck Office Systems'Desqview is a text-based windowing program that does not require amouse and runs in less memory than Windows, making it better thanWindows for handling text-based programs.andP;  Desqview also providestask switching and can multitask programs on an 80286-basedmachine with expanded memory.andP;  Westlake Data Corp's PathMinderPlus is an excellent file and program management package thatprovides a customizable menu shell giving the user multiple viewsof data, files and directories.andP;  The memory-resident SideKick Plusprogram from Borland International Inc offers such deskaccessories as outlining and note pads.andP;  Other utilities thatallow long file names, create a consistent user interface, andoffer on-line help or advanced memory management capabilities arediscussed.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     CustomizationUser InterfaceMS-DOSUtilitiesOperating Systems.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Want to endow DOS with some of the advanced features of Windows or Windows3.0 and OS/2 are, as the phrase goes, more than just pretty interfaces.andO;Beneath their graphic displays can be found a wealth of tools to makecomputing easier.andP;  But if you don't want to invest in new hardware orsoftware and only want some of the benefits of Windows or OS/2, here are somepotent DOS-based alternatives that you can order a la carte.andM;BENEFIT: WINDOWED APPLICATIONSandM;Windows and OS/2 display applications in separate windows that share the samescreen.andP;  You can keep an eye on everything that's going on and switch amongtasks as your attention is required.andM;DOS SOLUTION: DESQVIEWandM;Desqview is often better than Windows for handling text-based software.andO;Desqview's simple, non-graphic windows don't bristle with controls likeMicrosoft's, but they're equally usable.andP;  Although Desqview does support amouse, it doesn't require one.andM;Without a 386, unruly programs under Desqview can overwrite other windows.andO;But Desqview provides special &quot;loaders&quot; to handle the most populartroublemakers, such as Lotus 1-2-3.andP;  Windows 3.0 doesn't even try to runprograms in windows on a 286 or 8088 machine.andM;DESQVIEW $129.95andM;DESQVIEW 386 $219.95 (includes QEMM and Manifest, memory management tools)andM;QUARTERDECK OFFICE SYSTEMSandM;150 Pico Blvd.andM;Santa Monica, Calif.andP;  90405 (213) 392-9701andM;BENEFIT: MULTITASKINGandM;Multitasking lets your computer apportion its time among several independentprograms so that all run simultaneously.andP;  As you write a document, yourspreadsheet in the background churns away at a recalc, your communicationsprogram downloads a file and your database completes a sort.andM;DOS SOLUTION: DESQVIEWandM;Use Desqview to run several programs at the same time, displaying them eitherfull-screen or in windows.andP;  It works on any PC compatible, uses expandedmemory and consumes far less disk space than Windows 3.0 or OS/2.andM;Like Windows, Desqview can't fully control DOS applications or run them in asmall window or in the background with a 386 machine.andM;Although Desqview works best when used with a 386 and QEMM, Desqview'sextended memory manager, it multitasks programs on a 286 with expanded memoryand takes advantage of the memory-handling capabilities in programs-such asLotus 1-2-3 Release 3 and Paradox-that use extended memory.andP;  Although someill-behaved programs can cause a crash within Desqview, they are rare.andM;Windows 3.0 conflicts with Desqview because Windows doesn't use Desqview'sQEMM.andP;  But Quarterdeck Office Systems has announced version 2.3 of Desqviewthat is not only compatible with Windows but can even run Windows in real orstandard mode within a Desqview window.andM;DESQVIEW $129.95andM;QEMM $99.95andM;DESQVIEW 386 $219.95 (includes QEMM and Manifest)andM;QUARTERDECK OFFICE SYSTEMSandM;150 Pico Blvd.andM;Santa Monica, Calif.andP;  90405 (213) 392-9701andM;BENEFIT: FILE AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENTandM;OS/2 and Windows make managing files and launching programs a snap-or rathera click of a mouse.andP;  Simply point to files you want to move, copy or erase.andO;To run a program, simply click on one of the data files associated with it.andM;DOS SOLUTION: PATHMINDER PLUSandM;PathMinder Plus means never having to face a C: prompt again.andP;  It's acomplete substitute for every DOS function in the form of a customizable menushell that gives you multiple views of directories, files and data.andM;Select files by moving a cursor on a directory list and tapping the space baror a mouse button.andP;  You can rename a directory, move selected files toanother directory without creating extra copies or move files between drives.andO;A keystroke expands or collapses directory listings.andP;  You can see which filesharbor hidden, system or protected attributes and easily change theattributes.andM;View the contents of many text, spreadsheet and database files simply bypointing at them.andP;  Pointing at a file also automatically launches theapplication that created it, and PathMinder Plus uses only 4K of RAM whilethe application is running.andM;PathMinder Plus's &quot;reconfigurable user interface&quot; can mimic the look and feelof other DOS shells, such as The Norton Commander and X-Tree.andP;  Or you candesign your own shell by placing information windows wherever you like andchoosing from a variety of menu designs.andP;  To create a menu for inexperiencedusers, for example, you might want to eliminate the delete command.andM;The shell includes a Crosstalk Mk.4-compatible communications program,multifile text editor, file encryption and decryption, pop-up card file,calculator and appointment calendar.andM;PATHMINDER PLUS $149andM;WESTLAKE DATA CORP.andM;P.O.andP;  Box 1711andM;Austin, Texas 78767andM;(512) 328-1041andM;BENEFIT: DESK ACESSORIESandM;Windows and OS/2 contain desk accessories-note pad, calculator, calendar,alarm clock and electronic Rolodex-that enable you to work with a clean deskexcept for your PC and phone.andM;DOS SOLUTION: SIDEKICK PLUSandM;Memory-resident SideKick Plus gives you access to nine note pads, nineoutlines, a file manager, a phone book with a built-in telecomm program, atime planner with alarms, four calculators (business, scientific, programmingand formula), an ASCII table and an animated space invaders game-all usingonly 80K of conventional RAM.andP;  It manages this feat by swapping the programyou're running to disk or expanded memory before loading any of itsaccessories.andM;SideKick Plus, which operates in text mode only, doesn't include a paintprogram, as Windows does; it also takes longer to pop up than memory-residentsoftware that remains loaded in RAM.andM;SIDEKICK PLUS $199.95andM;BORLAND INTERNATIONAL INC.andM;1700 Green Hills RoadandM;Scotts Valley, Calif.andP;  95066andM;(408) 438-8400andM;BENEFIT: LONG FILENAMESandM;OS/2 allows filenames as long as 255 characters.andP;  Windows, which uses DOSnames for data files, lets you put long names on icons in the ProgramManager.andM;DOS SOLUTION: EXTEND-A-NAME PLUSandM;Assign 60-character names to your files with ExtendA-Name Plus, amemory-resident utility.andP;  Extend-A-Name recognizes the commands certainapplications use to load and save files, and it pops up a menu of longfilenames whenever a program prompts you for a conventional DOS filename.andP;  Itthen translates the long filename you select into a shorter DOS filename andtypes it into the application for you.andP;  If the program you're running isn'tone of Extend-A-Name's 31 supported applications, you can pop up the programmanually when prompted for a filename.andP;  Extend-A-Name uses 45K of RAM, oronly 5K if expanded memory is available.andP;  It includes a tree-oriented diskbrowser, a file-archiving utility and a file viewer.andM;EXTEND-A-NAME PLUS $89andM;WORLD SOFTWARE CORP.andM;124 Prospect St.andM;Ridgewood, N.J.andP;  07450 (800) 962-6360 (201) 444-3228andM;BENEFIT: CONSISTENT USER INTERFACEandM;Programs with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are easier to use because theylook alike.andP;  Menus are in the same places and perform similar tasks; thecontrols work the same.andP;  If you're familiar with the way one program works,you can easily use another program with the identical interface.andM;DOS SOLUTIONS: SUPERKEY AND KEYWORKSandM;Create a user interface that spans DOS applications with keyboard macrosoftware such as SuperKey or Keyworks Advanced.andP;  Both are memory-residentprograms that let you record the most complex series of keystrokes; play themback either by pressing a single key combination or by making a menu choice.andM;Do you occasionally use Paradox but feel more comfortable with Lotus 1-2-3?andO;Then create a macro that lets you press the / key in Paradox and bring up amenu just as in 1-2-3.andP;  You can also program function keys or remap theentire keyboard to work as they do in your favorite program.andP;  Or create aninterface from scratch that makes sense for you.andM;Both SuperKey and Keyworks let you create pop-up menus to select commands.andO;Of the two programs, Keyworks is more versatile; it also works with DOS 4.0,which SuperKey does not.andP;  Keyworks' menus are easier to create.andP;  It providesa fill-in-the-blanks form to specify everything you want a menu to do.andP;  Oncethe form is completed, the information is translated into KeyWorks' own macrolanguage, a powerful feature that gives you many of the abilities of anadvanced programming language.andP;  Keyworks can look for text in certain areasof the screen (for example, a &quot;READY&quot; message in the upper-right corner of1-2-3) before executing a command.andP;  But it requires more memory (128Kcompared with SuperKey's 64 to 100K) and costs more.andM;SUPERKEY $99.95andM;BORLAND INTERNATIONAL INC.andM;1700 Green Hills RoadandM;Scotts Valley, Calif.andP;

 A wordprocessor may pull a graph from a spreadsheet, which in turn received thedata for that graph from a file downloaded by a communications program.andO;While not all Windows programs support DDE, both Windows and OS/2 can cutinformation from one program and paste it into another.andP;  The effect issimilar to DDE, but the process is manual, not automated.andM;DOS SOLUTIONS: CUT/PASTE, INSET, HIJAAKandM;Non-Windows programs lack an equivalent for the DDE standard, but you can getthe same benefit by carefully selecting the applications you use together.andO;For example, you can link WordPerfect and Microsoft Word to 1-2-3 and Excelspreadsheets; whenever you print a document, it updates itself with thelatest data contained in a specific spreadsheet range.andP;  Linking, however, isnot common among DOS programs.andM;To get the benefits of cut-and-paste for text-based programs, try Cut/Paste3.0, a public domain, memory-resident program that uses only 6K of RAM.andO;SuperKey and Keyworks also have cut-and-paste capabilities.andM;To cut artwork or graphs and paste them into other programs, you need theone-two punch of InSet and HiJaak, both from Inset Systems.andP;  With InSet youcan capture and edit screen images and print them, even if you're using aword processor that doesn't import graphics.andM;If you're using an application that supports graphics, you can capture animage with InSet or HiJaak's screen-capture utility and then use HiJaak toconvert the file into TIFF, GIF, PIC, HPGL or another format that yourprogram recognizes.andP;  The memory-resident portion of either HiJaak or InSetconsumes about 40K.andM;CUT/PASTE 3.0 FreeandM;On CompuServe: CP3.ARC in Library 7, IBMSYS ForumandM;Also available on the PC/Computing &quot;Super DOS&quot;

 The Best of DOS Help, a 63Kmemory-resident program that explains many DOS commands, is sent to readerswho renew their subscriptions.andM;The giveaway version is based on the complete DOS Help from FlambeauxSoftware.andP;  The full-fledged program provides a context-sensitive help systemthat determines which command you've begun to type and offers informationabout that command at the touch of a hotkey.andP;  It includes all of theinformation that's in the DOS manual, plus cogent, witty and practical tipson how and when to use a command.andM;DOS HELP $49.andM;FLAMBEAUX SOFTWARE INC.andM;1147 E.

Are you reluctant to add 4MB ofmemory to your otherwise healthy 386 just to run OS/2?andM;If so, GeoWorks' GEOS-short for Graphical Environment Operating System--maybe just what you need.andP;  Slated for release in September for less than $200,GEOS brings a graphical interface to older, less powerful PCs not suited toWindows.andM;Seeing GEOS in action is a lot like watching Windows.andP;  The graphics aresimilar-and in some cases prettier.andP;  Anyone who appreciates Windows'point-and-shoot action will take to GEOS immediately.andP;  Though it's notrequired, you con use a mouse, as you do with Windows, to point at filenamesand menu selections.andP;  You launch programs and functions by clicking on iconsand graphics buttons.andP;  Dialog boxes pop up for you to enter information, andyou con resize and move windows.andM;GEOS includes several &quot;mini-applications&quot; that resemble the productivitytools included with Windows 3.0.andP;  GeoWrite is a word processor equivalent tothe entry level of Samna's Ami in features and performance.andP;  GeoManager isthe equivalent of Windows 3.0's File Manager; anyone with Windows experiencecan quickly got to work with it.andP;  GeoDraw and GeoDex are analogous toWindows' Paint and Cardfile, while Notepad and Calculator work just as aWindows user would expect them to.andM;When you install GEOS, you choose a &quot;scalable interface&quot; from a simplegraphical menu to determine how you'll work with GEOS's applications.andP;  Thechoices are Appliances, First Time and Professional; your selection willaffect how the application looks.andM;Thanks to the scalable interface, you don't have to grapple with anapplication you don't understand or work with a product that's too simplisticfor you.andP;  As your skills change, so too can the way you work with aparticular application.andP;  GEOS is the first interface to scale the difficultyof the application to the user.andM;Although GeoWarks designed GEOS to run on lower-end hardware, nothing in itis low-end technology.andP;  As an example, while demonstrating the product,GeoWorks representatives opened a window containing live, full-motion videofrom a TV signal.andP;  The video continued to run during the rest of the demowithout slowing the system down.andP;  A GEOS feature called an &quot;event scheduler&quot;ensures that no one application grabs the processor and hangs on to thedetriment of others.andM;PC/Computing tested GEOS and Windows 3.0 on a variety of different platforms,including a Compaq LTE laptop with an 8086 CPU and 640K of RAM.andP;  GEOS ransurprisingly quickly on the laptop--noticeably faster than Windows, whichspent more time swapping portions of itself to disk.andM;Technically, GEOS is a pre-emptive, multitasking operating environment.andO;Although similar in concept to OS/2, GEOS is not an operating system.andP;  OS/2replaces DOS completely, whereas GEOS runs on top of DOS and requires DOS torun, much like Windows 3.0.andP;  Unlike OS/2 or Windows, however, GEOS doesn'tmultitask DOS applications.andP;  Because the design goal was to make the productrun easily on computers with 1MB or less of RAM, GEOS can't support multipleDOS sessions and still obtain reasonable performance.andP;  GEOS can, however,multitask applications written specifically for it.andM;When you run a DOS application, GEOS removes most of itself from memory,leaving a 70-byte (yes, byte) stub so that when you return to your GEOSsession, everything is exactly as you left it.andP;  While the DOS application isactive, GEOS suspends all other activities.andM;The success of GEOS depends on how many software companies rewrite theirprograms to GEOS's specifications.andP;  it has attracted the attention of Lotus,which could make GEOS an important platform on machines that have difficultyrunning Windows 3.0.andM;GEOS is a new product, so it is far from having the confirmed vendor supportthat guarantees success.andP;  But remember, Windows was once a new concept, withlittle industry support and a lot of skepticism.andP;  GEOS is for ahead of whereWindows was at its first revision level.andP;  Snappy with limited hardware,sporting its scalable user interface and featuring quality graphics andoutput, GEOS is off to a good start as it begins life as an alternative toWindows and OS/2.andM;GEOS $195andM;GEOWORKSandM;2150 Shattuck Ave.andM;Berkeley, Calif.andP;  94704andM;(415) 644-0883</TEXT></DOC>
