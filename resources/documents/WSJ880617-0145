The Nuestra Senora de Atocha and its sister ship, the Santa Margarita, went down off the Florida Keys in a 1622 hurricane, taking to the bottom booty collected from Spain's New World colonies. Treasure hunter Mel Fisher and his team of divers located and salvaged the wrecks of the two ships.    Besides silver coins and bullion bars weighing up to 90 pounds, Wednesday's auction at Christie's also featured a silvergilt rosewater dish that failed to sell during the main session Tuesday night.    The Spanish Ministry of Culture claimed the dish, which portrays a Spaniard carrying a spear and blowing a hunting horn, for $49,500.    Wednesday's session drew about 100 numismatic buffs and other curiosity seekers, compared with 450 people Tuesday night.    A 78-pound, 10-ounce silver bar from the Atocha, which yielded the richest treasure haul ever found, sold for $14,300. An extremely rare Philip IV coin from the mint of Santa Fe de Bogota went within its presale estimate at $2,800. The last and smallest silver bar -- a one-pound, four-ounce specimen estimated at $400 to $600 -- shot up to $3,300.    Other silver bars hovered mostly in the $8,000 to $10,000 range.    &quot;They're something you'd want for a souvenir -- but who would want a lot of them?&quot; said Anthony M. Phillips, head of the silver department at Christie's.    Mr. Phillips said the bars would &quot;melt for about half&quot; of their auction price.    The showy, big-ticket items went Tuesday night, when the crowd of onlookers included Texas oil tycoon Nelson Bunker Hunt and actress Margot Kidder. Neither made a purchase.    The Portuguese Navy Museum purchased two brass mariner's astrolabes used by the pilots of the ill-fated vessels. They went for $132,000 and $83,000 Tuesday night.    Mr. Phillips also said that a &quot;very rich, American private (collector)&quot; had submitted the $319,000 bid Tuesday for a 62-inch-long Renaissance gold chain recovered from the Margarita. </TEXT></DOC>
