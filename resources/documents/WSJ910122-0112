A lawyer and spokesman for the thrift, William A. HaganJr. of the Manhattan firm Shea andamp; Gould, confirmed a SundayNew York Times story that CrossLand is under investigationfor possible tax fraud. The Times said tax auditors hadconcluded the troubled company would be liable for about $52million in back taxes and penalties and said the subsidiariesearned $150 million from 1985 until their liquidation inDecember 1989. Such profits aren't taxed in Delaware butwould be taxed by both the city and state of New York.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Hagan confirmed that city tax authorities had pursuedan investigation over several months, bringing in stateauthorities at a later stage, and that both informed himshortly after Christmas that they were referring the case tothe Manhattan district attorney's office and the stateattorney general's office.   But he said establishment of the Delaware units wascompletely above board. He said CrossLand set up thecompanies to issue market-rate-adjustable preferred stockwhose dividends were largely free of federal corporate taxes.The companies in turn derived their income frommortgage-backed securities and similar instruments. Heestimated that more than 50 companies have done much the samething.   &quot;These weren't dummy companies,&quot; he said. &quot;They were allregistered with the Securities and Exchange Commission andhad substantial assets. We have (their operations) in ourfinancial statements.&quot;   Mr. Hagan said the crux of any disagreement with taxauthorities was whether &quot;sufficient management activities andoperations for the subsidiaries were conducted in Delaware&quot;or in the New York City headquarters. He said thesubsidiaries' task was essentially bookkeeping and thelimited number of people required for that worked inDelaware.   He contended that the dispute ought to be handled by civillitigation, not by a criminal investigation for possiblefraud. He said city tax investigators suggested that if thethrift paid back taxes and penalties, the matter might bedropped.   A spokesman for the New York State Department of Taxationand Finance declined to comment on the case. The city'sDepartment of Finance, and offices of both city and stateprosecutors, were closed for Martin Luther King Day.   Mr. Hagan vigorously denied that CrossLand's Delawareventure was aimed at evading taxes. He described theoperation as &quot;lawful tax avoidance.&quot;   CrossLand, one of the nation's largest thrifts with assetsexceeding $11 billion, had a $251 million loss in the firstnine months of 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
