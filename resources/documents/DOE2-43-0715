South Africa, as a major supplier ofuranium, was a founder member of the IAEA, and its existing three reactors,have all been under IAEA safeguards since their inception. Despite this,government has persistently refused to sign the NPT, claiming that itmight enable IAEA inspectors to learn too much about the 'unique' uraniumenrichment process used at its two unsafequarded plants at Valindaba,Pretoria. The South African government faces a difficult choice, thenature of which depends on whether the country has in fact acquired nuclearweapons.</TEXT></DOC>
