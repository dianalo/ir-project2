In 1987, the most recent year in which figures were immediatelyavailable, the State Department put the total of U.S. loans tosub-Saharan Africa at $4.3 billion, including $743 million indevelopment loans, $1.5 billion from the U.S. government'sExport-Import Bank and $1.2 billion in U.S. government loans to buysurplus American farm products.   Bush did not say which of these categories would be included.   Africa south of the Sahara Desert is usually taken to mean all ofAfrica except South Africa and the North African countries on theMediterranean _ Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco.   Bush said his action would be in accordance with a decision takenlast year at an economic summit in Toronto to offer differentoptions to creditor governments. Until now, the United States haspreferred only to stretch out repayment terms.   Bush did not mention Latin American debt, which is much greaterthan African debt but is owed in large part to commercial banks inNorth America and Europe rather than to governments. Major examplesare Mexico, which owes more than $100 billion, and Argentina, $60billion.   Earlier in the day Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady spoke toreporters at length about the banks' current negotiations withMexico.   ``With respect to Mexico they will sell those loans at less than100 cents on the dollar and this is the first time that has beenrecognized,'' Brady said. ``The stumbling blocks now they're arguingabout (are) whether those loans, which were borrowed at 100, shouldbe 90, 80, 70, 60, somewhere in there.''   Other governments, notably in West Germany, France, theNetherlands and the Nordic countries, have converted many loans intogrants. When major U.S. aid programs began with the Marshall Planfor western Europe after World War II, the bulk of the money was ingrants. Over the years, loans became the preferred form of U.S. aid.   As Third World debt mounted and the burden of interest paymentson debtor countries increased, the pendulum has swung back togrants. Recipients of the biggest chunks of U.S. aid _ Israel andEgypt _ now get grants and not loans.   In 1987, sub-Saharan Africa owed $137.8 billion in medium- andlong-term debt. It was estimated that payments due from thesecountries had risen from $5.6 billion in 1979 to $21 billion a yearfor the period 1986 to 1989.   Total Third World debt is put at about $1.3 trillion.</TEXT></DOC>
