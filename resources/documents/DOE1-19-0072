The synthesized {sup 76}AsCl{sub 3}was purified by distillation or partially purified by treatment withdry acetonitrile followed by filtration. Identification was accomplishedby thin layer chromatography (TLC) and reversed phase high performanceliquid chromatography (HPLC), {sup 76}AsCl{sub 3} was used for synthesisof a dihydrophenarsazine derivative.</TEXT></DOC>
