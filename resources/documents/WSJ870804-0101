AMC said Monday it settled a shareholder challenge to the proposed merger, removing one of the last obstacles in time for a shareholder vote tomorrow.    Meanwhile, lawyers close to the situation said they expect the Federal Trade Commission to approve the absorption of AMC by the No. 3 domestic auto maker, perhaps as early as today. &quot;We don't have anything to the contrary,&quot; an AMC spokesman said. &quot;We're optimistic.&quot;    The commission and its staff, after making supplemental requests for large amounts of information from Chrysler last month, apparently concluded that the proposed merger doesn't violate federal antitrust laws and won't significantly reduce industry competition, according to these sources.    Agency officials declined to comment on the status of the commission's review. But agency officials, according to these sources, have informally told Chrysler executives that the commission is expected to base its approval on, among other things, AMC's tiny market share and the prospect of continuing stiff competition from Japanese and other foreign auto makers.    Executives of Highland Park, Mich.-based Chrysler said they hope to complete their acquisition of AMC for $4.50 a share, or an estimated $1.18 billion, tomorrow.    Under terms of the settlement of the stockholder challenge, AMC will pay nothing to the three plaintiff shareholders, but won't oppose the plaintiffs' attorneys in their request that the court award them as much as $300,000 in fees and expenses from the company. In return, the plaintiffs have agreed to the dismissal of their suit with prejudice, meaning the action cannot be refiled.    AMC shareholders are scheduled to meet tomorrow morning at the company's headquarters in Southfield, Mich. Chrysler's bid has the support of Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, the French auto maker that holds a controlling interest in AMC stock. An AMC spokesman said a proxy vote &quot;is going very well&quot; for the Chrysler offer.    The shareholder challenges were originally filed as three separate suits -- two in New York City and one in Philadelphia -- all attacking Chrysler's original March offer to buy AMC for $4 a share, or an estimated $1.11 billion. The three suits were later consolidated into one class action now pending before U.S. District Court Judge Richard Owen in Manhattan. Judge Owen must approve the settlement arrangement for it to become final.    An attorney for the plaintiffs said the intervention by the dissident stockholders and their lawyers was instrumental in forcing Chrysler to boost its offer to $4.50 a share, or about $1.18 billion. Once Chrysler sweetened its bid, however, the plaintiffs decided they had little more to gain from continuing their litigation, the lawyer said.    Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Chrysler closed at $40.375, down 37.5 cents. AMC finished at $4.625, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
