RobertsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CNT ATBANKRUPTCIES (BCY)TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Argo Communications Corp., a small long-distance company faced with increasing competition, said it filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.    The New Rochelle, N.Y.-based company also cited &quot;substantial losses,&quot; the collapse of a previously announced plan to merge with two other long-distance carriers and default on a $200,000 payment on Dec. 31 to a unit of Citicorp. In addition, several local telephone companies have threatened to stop providing Argo with connections to customers, Argo said.    Securities analysts expressed little surprise at the move and some said it provided more evidence of the shakeout and consolidation under way among long-distance carriers. &quot;The competitive environment is in no way cooling off,&quot; said Robert Morris III, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. &quot;It's getting hotter and hotter.&quot;    In its filing with the federal district court here, Argo listed total assets of $73.8 million and total liabilities of $53.5 million. About $16.6 million of the debt is secured. Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors' lawsuits while it develops a plan to pay debt. Among Argo's largest unsecured creditors are American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., to which the company owes $2.1 million, and the New York Telephone Co. unit of Nynex Corp., to which it owes $875,000.    In the filing, the six-year-old company said that it has been a &quot;development stage&quot; enterprise for much of its existence and sustained big losses as it financed the construction of its network. The carrier uses satellites for transmitting conversations and data and serves several hundred customers in 19 cities.    The market is witnessing vigorous competition among big national carriers such as ATandamp;T and MCI Communications Corp. and scores of regional long-distance carriers. Long-distance calling rates are falling sharply as ATandamp;T -- at its own initiative or under orders from the Federal Communications Commission -- cuts its charges and other carriers respond in kind.    In the most dramatic example yet of industry consolidation, the unprofitable long-distance units of GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc. last year merged into a 50-50 joint venture, US Sprint Communications Co. And in late 1985, Allnet Communications Corp. and Lexitel Corp. merged to form ALC Communications Corp.    As previously reported, Argo signed a letter of intent to combine with Microtel Inc., Boca Raton, Fla., and Litel Telecommunications Corp., Worthington, Ohio, two closely held concerns. In the filing, Argo said the three couldn't agree on terms. After the talks collapsed, Argo said, its major shareholders were unwilling to provide further financing.    Two of the major holders, Centel Corp. and Alltel Corp., both telecommunications concerns, said they would take fourth-quarter charges totaling $60.5 million to write down their Argo investmests.    Edward Greenberg, an analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., said Argo also was plagued by one particular problem. &quot;Long-distance communications through satellite was something whose time never came,&quot; he asserted.    Argo officials couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
