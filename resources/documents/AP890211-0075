Ms. Bhutto, speaking at a banquet put on by Premier Li Peng, saidher visit had special significance in that she was fulfilling apromise made after her election in November to make China her firstforeign stop.   ``This demonstrates that the democratic government attachesspecial importance and priority to Pakistan's time-tested relationswith China,'' she said.   Ms. Bhutto received a boisterous welcome from about 200 Pakistanidiplomats, residents and schoolchildren at the airport.   She broke with normal procedure, walking away from a waitinglimousine to shake hands with the Pakistanis. Many shouted her nameand waved banners in English, Arabic and Chinese reading ``Long LiveBenazir Bhutto'' and ``Long Live Sino-Pakistan Friendship.''   The Pakistani leader will spend three days in China. In additionto Li, she plans to meet with senior leader Deng Xiaoping and thegeneral secretary of the Communist Party, Zhao Ziyang.   The official Xinhua News Agency said Afghanistan will be the mainfocus of talks, but another topic is expected to be Chinese armssales to Pakistan. The Muslim Newspaper in Islamabad reportedSaturday that Pakistan had reached agreement with China to purchase75 F-7 jets, a Chinese version of the MiG-21, at a cost of about$225 million.   China is second only to the United States in providing militaryequipment to Pakistan and is now helping Pakistan develop itsnuclear industry. Both Pakistan and China have denied persistentreports the nuclear aid has military applications.   Ms. Bhutto, in her banquet remarks, recalled how her father, thelate Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, made his first foreign tripto China in 1972.   She said her father had sent all four of his children to Chinafor a month in 1972, when she was a student in the United States.She returned to China with Bhutto on his 1976 state visit.   Her speech also gave a rundown of Pakistan's foreign policy,which generally has knitted closely with that of China.   Pakistan was glad to see prospects of improved relations betweenChina and India following Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visitto Beijing in December, Ms. Bhutto said. She said her recent talkswith the Indian leader also ``helped to remove some of the mistrustthat has bedeviled the Pak-India relationship.''   Ms. Bhutto also praised the warming of relations between Chinaand the Soviet Union, to culminate with Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev's visit to Beijing in May. It will be the firstSino-Soviet summit in 30 years.   ``We believe that the reduction of tension and resolution ofoutstanding issues between the two great neighbors will be conduciveto peace and stability in our region,'' she said.   China and Pakistan, with common adversaries in India and theSoviet Union, have been very close since Pakistan became one of thefirst countries to recognize the Communist government in Beijingafter it was established in 1949.   China had close relations with Ms. Bhutto's predecessor, MohammedZia ul-Haq, under whose rule Ms. Bhutto's father was arrested andexecuted in 1979. But Beijing was quick to support Ms. Bhutto aftershe was elected to succeed Zia, who died in a suspicious plane crashin August.   Before the banquet, Ms. Bhutto was officially greeted by Li at awelcoming ceremony inside the Great Hall of the People.   On Sunday, Ms. Bhutto is to hold talks with Li and meet partyleader Zhao. She is also to meet Deng Yingchao, the widow of PremierChou En-lai, her host during her 1972 visit to China.   She departs Sunday evening for Shanghai, where she is to meetPresident Yang Shangkun. She will meet Deng there Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
