However, fighting continued between loyal troops and otherrebels in the country's financial center.   Military officials said the failure of the rebels to capture theCamp Aguinaldo military headquarters dealt a fatal blow to the3-day-old coup attempt.   ``I will fulfill what I said _ no cease-fire. What they started,we will finish,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a national radio address.   At least 51 people have been killed and nearly 300 wounded sincethe insurgents launched their revolt Friday.   Rebels bombarded the military headquarters at Camp Aguinaldoearly Sunday with 105mm howitzers, and government jet fighters andhelicopter gunships attacked the mutineers' positions.   The military said the rebels also launched a ground attack onCamp Aquinaldo, five miles east of Mrs. Aquino's office, but it wasrepulsed after a four-hour battle. The commander of the rebelassault, Lt. Col. Cesar dela Pena, later surrendered with more than200 men.   Later Sunday, Brig. Gen. Marcelo Blando, commander of FortMagsaysay, surrendered in the city's Greenhills District with about400 army soldiers and Scout Rangers, military officials said.   ``The attempted coup by rebel soldiers has been crushed,''Defense Minister Fidel Ramos said after dela Pena surrendered.Scattered sniper fire around the camp was reported later althoughthere was no sign of substantial rebel forces in the area.   In suburban Makati, the country's financial district, hundredsof heavily armed rebels were still holding out in luxury hotels,condominiums, banks and office buildings after battles broke outSaturday. Military sources said it would be difficult to remove therebels because of the potential for damage and loss of civilianlife.   Police had planned to attack the mutineers late Saturday, butthe rebels struck first, killing one policeman and wounding 14others.   Rebels fired volleys of machine-gun fire from Makati skyscrapersand snipers shot at vehicles on Epifanio delos Santos Avenue.   Radio station DZRH broadcast an appeal for ambulances, sayingmany civilians lay wounded along Makati's Pasay Road.   A spokesman for the U.S.-run Clark Air Base said there were noAmerican warplanes in the skies over Manila Sunday. U.S. militaryplanes began flying cover for government troops Friday, hours afterrebels launched their assaults, but American officials said theU.S. planes ended those flights at 6 a.m. Saturday.   A government spokesman said Mrs. Aquino and her family attendedMass at the Malacanang Palace and prayed for an end to the carnage.   The rebel shelling of Camp Aguinaldo set fire to theHeadquarters Service Company building and hundreds of militaryfamilies fled. Hospitals reported three people were killed and 25wounded by the bombardment.   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, chief of the Capital Defense Command,said some mutinous marines infiltrated the camp, seizing thechapel, dispensary and other small buildings near the main gate.   He said the rebels smashed through the main gate with an armoredvehicle that was immediately hit by ground fire from the defendersand the mutineers were unable to advance.   The country's two international airports in Manila and Ceburemained closed Sunday, and domestic flights were also canceled.   In Makati, rebels roamed through the affluent shops andIntercontinental Hotel Saturday. It was not known how many guestswere registered at the hotel. The guests were allowed to stayinside, but mutineers ran other people out.   Rebels blocked off a major street with commandeered trucks. Onemutineer said his group changed the color of its shoulder patchesfrom white to red ``because red is the color of blood, and we wantto shed blood for our cause.''   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said rebelscontrolled parts of Manila and the Mactan Air Base in Cebu, 350miles south of Manila.   The army commander, Maj. Gen. Manuel Cacanando, estimated thatfrom 800 to 2,000 troopers had joined the revolt, the sixthattempted coup against Mrs. Aquino in less than four years and themost serious challenge to her government.   Police said some assailants may be Communist insurgents seekingto take advantage of confusion brought on by the revolt, whichbegan Friday when mutineers seized air force headquarters atVillamor Air Base, the government television station and otherstrongpoints. The rebels later gave up the air base and station.   Warplanes had attacked rebel positions around Camp AguinaldoSaturday and the insurgents fired back with tanks, mortars andmachine guns.   In one attack, air force jets accidentally strafed 2,000pro-government troopers, killing six.   Mrs. Aquino's failure to crush the 20-year-old Communistinsurgency is one reason for the discontent with her government,particularly within the military. She also has been criticized fornot improving the Philippines' economy since coming to power in a1986 military-civilian uprising that ousted President FerdinandMarcos.   Military officials said one coup leader _ an associate ofrenegade Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, who led an August1987 coup try _ had been arrested.   Rebel sources said Honasan was among the key planners of thecurrent coup attempt.   Maj. Jose Gutierrez identified the rebel leader as Lt. Col. TitoLegazpi and said he was arrested after taking part in an attack onthe Sangley Point naval air station outside Manila, which therebels briefly held.</TEXT></DOC>
