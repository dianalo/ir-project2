Beyond these unlikely nameplates sit the Ministry of International Trade and Industry bureaucrats who direct Japan's weightiest research target: energy. From these and other offices, the ministry this year will funnel 117 billion yen ($816 million) to energy research, more than to all other ministry projects combined. Some of the results: the world's best solar cells; generators producing electricity from gasified coal, tides and seawater; and superconducting power lines. Ample funds have helped Japan put down research roots from Australia to New Mexico and engage in such unlikely projects as floating nuclear plants and fish farms.    While Europe and America discontinued energy projects in the face of falling oil prices, Japan continued to pour yen into energy research. &quot;It shows how much of a crisis mentality Japan has over energy,&quot; says Ryuji Ishikawa, assistant director at the Natural Energy Resources Agency. &quot;We want to be prepared for the next oil crisis.&quot;    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, says that money spent now on energy-saving and alternate-energy technologies will help Japan cut its dependence on imported oil and cushion it from energy-market disruptions.    But there also are more lucrative results. Japan's obsession with research has made it a top contender in markets for energy equipment. And should another oil crisis hit, Japanese companies expect to have leading-edge technologies that others abandoned in fatter times, much as they had the small, fuel-efficient cars that Americans wanted during the first oil crisis.    The world &quot;will probably come to us, asking us to teach them these technologies,&quot; says Nobuaki Akatsu, general manager of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.'s technical headquarters.    Japan's concern with energy began, like everyone else's, with the 1973 oil crisis. While it scrambled to find oil, the country also began crash programs to find alternate sources of energy.    The biggest was the Sunshine Project, begun in 1974 and involving hundreds of Japanese companies, including such big names as Toshiba Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. While MITI usually focuses research money on narrow targets -- supercomputers, say, or memory chips -- it takes the scatter-gun approach to energy research; projects cover every conceivable energy-related topic.    Many projects under the Sunshine program are such familiar technologies as wind-operated generators, hydrogen-fueled cars and geothermal energy plants. On the northern coast of Shikoku island, for example, MITI built a bank of solar cells the size of a football field. Elsewhere, a MITI-built warehouse uses solar cells to keep food frozen.    Others are more unusual. Several companies have developed a system that taps underground heat by pumping water into hot, dry rock, and then piping out the steam to turn turbines. Another project uses the temperature difference between deep and shallow seawater to power turbines. Other projects seek to harness tides, turn wood into burnable gas and make solar cells using dyes rather than silicon.    Other nations have dabbled in similar projects, but Japan's energy quest hasn't faltered. &quot;Some are saying we should slow down,&quot; says Konosuke Ikeya, deputy director of the Sunshine Project. &quot;But the government's policy is that Randamp;D has a long lead time and that we can't be swayed by the short-term energy situation.&quot;    In fact, Sunshine's 1987 budget is its highest yet at 44 billion yen, despite cuts in most other MITI research programs. A government survey found that Japanese government and industry together spent 759 billion yen on energy research in the year ended March 31, 1986.    Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Energy cut funds for energy research to $2.2 billion last year from $4.2 billion in 1981, paring many alternate-energy programs.    Europe has done likewise. The French Agency for Energy Management, for instance, slashed its budget to 220 million francs ($36.3 million) in 1987 from 427 million francs in 1983.    Japan imports 83% of its energy, in contrast to 59% in France and 9.6% in the U.S. Japan depends on oil for 57% of its energy supply but wants to cut that to under 48% by 1995. &quot;Our energy-supply structure is frail,&quot; says the energy agency's Mr. Ishikawa. &quot;We can't afford to be shortsighted&quot; about research and development.    That approach was driven home in 1978 with the second oil crisis. As petroleum prices soared, MITI kicked off its Moonlight Project, wide-ranging research aimed at trimming energy consumption. The government wants to cut energy consumption 20% by 1995 from 1982 levels.    Among the project's programs: huge new batteries that store power generated at night to sell during peak-demand daytime hours; &quot;fuel cells&quot; that use chemical reactions to turn fuels into electricity; and a new motor called the Stirling Cycle engine that runs on oil, natural gas, or coal and can power anything from air conditioners to buses.    MITI backs the project with government loans and tax incentives for companies that use Moonlight technologies.    The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductors means more Moonlight money for the 50 companies that are already working on MITI projects on superconducting power-transmission lines and power generators. In addition to MITI, Japan's Science and Technology Agency will spend an additional 83 billion yen this year on energy research. &quot;The government needs to pick up Randamp;D that is risky and needs massive amounts of money,&quot; says an official.    Heavy energy research has given Japanese companies an upper hand in overseas markets. Toshiba has become the world's biggest supplier of geothermal power equipment, supplying to such companies as Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co. in the U.S. Government-funded fusion research has helped make Hitachi a world leader in conventional superconductive magnets.    MITI says Japan is the world's biggest supplier of solar cells. Japan exported 534,000 electric generators last year, nearly four times as many as in 1976.    And the projects are giving makers technological spinoffs. Moonlight, for example, has pushed an advanced gas-turbine generator, a technology the West has largely dropped. &quot;It isn't something that we'll make money on soon,&quot; says Mitsubishi's Mr. Akatsu. &quot;But there are a lot of spinoff technologies.&quot;    Mitsubishi is developing a coal gasification plant that makes use of Moonlight technologies. &quot;We have a tremendous base of technologies now,&quot; says Mr. Akatsu. If another energy crisis comes &quot;we will have the best know-how&quot; in the world. </TEXT></DOC>
