The Soviet move raises new doubts that President Najib's Marxistgovernment can survive after Moscow withdraws its more than 100,000troops from Afghanistan, the diplomats said Thursday.   The rocket strikes this week suggest rebel supplies haveimproved and their commanders around the city are bettercoordinated, said the diplomats, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   They quoted one unconfirmed report as saying 4,000 Afghanguerrillas have massed on the western edge of the capital and saidfighting was reported on all fronts around Kabul.   Soviet forces already provide most of Kabul's air and artillerydefense, but Soviet troops now are moving to the capital'sperimeter to battle rebels, the diplomats said.   They said Soviet troops were sent to Kargha, three miles west ofKabul, after Afghan troops suffered setbacks. They gave no details.   The Soviet and Afghan governments maintain that the withdrawingSoviets are letting Afghan troops take the lead in fighting thecivil war.   Red Army troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help thegovernment fight U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas. The Soviet Unionagreed in April to withdraw its troops, and the withdrawal began inMay.   Rockets blasted the capital Tuesday and Wednesday. OfficialRadio Kabul reported 15 people killed Tuesday, and diplomats putthe toll at 17. Casualty figures for Wednesday's attack were notprovided.   Radio Kabul quoted Afghanistan's official Bakhtar news agency assaying shells hit residential areas of the country's eastern cityof Jalalabad Thursday. The broadcast said five people were killed.   Official Soviet and Afghan media blame the rocket attacks onAfghan guerrillas.   Abdul Haq, believed to be the strongest guerrilla commander inthe capital area, said residential areas are not targeted, butacknowledged some rockets go astray.   Haq also said Soviet and Afghan forces were rocketing thecapital in an effort to discredit the rebels and turn thepopulation against them.   Since the Soviet pullout started, Radio Kabul says almost 200rockets have slammed into Afghan cities.   Elsewhere in Afghanistan, 12 guerrillas and a Norwegian reliefworker were killed Wednesday night when their vehicle hit a mineclose to the Pakistan border, the Norwegian news agency NTBreported Thursday in Oslo.   Under the U.N.-brokered troop withdrawal accord, half of the RedArmy troops are to be gone by Aug. 15, and complete withdrawal isscheduled by Feb. 15, 1989.   Full Soviet withdrawal would leave about 50,000 governmenttroops fighting an estimated 200,000 rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
