<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-65-1003 </DOCNO><TEXT>A single-stage high-beam-quality XeCI laser, consisting of an oscillatorand a double-pass amplifier with a phase-conjugate Brillouin mirror,has been demonstrated with no optical coupling between the oscillatorand the amplifier. Maximum output energy of 20 mJ with a pulse durationof 13 ns full width at half maximum has been obtained with a 0.0015 A(469 MHz) linewidth, 1.2 X diffraction-limited beam divergence from acircular beam of an 8 mm diameter.</TEXT></DOC>
