LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israel said Thursday it will hold a kidnappedShiite Moslem cleric until Israeli soldiers are traded for him,despite threats to American hostages in Lebanon.   ``We still stick to our position that we are ready to exchangekidnap victims and hostages,'' Yossi Ahimeir, spokesman for PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir, told The Associated Press.   ``Our goal is to rescue, save our people in Lebanon in the handsof several organizations there. Of course, we are ready to makeexchanges of hostages.''   Israel has offered to trade Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid and otherLebanese Shiite prisoners for three soldiers held in Lebanon andthe Western hostages, who include eight Americans.   Commandos abducted Obeid from his home in south Lebanon on July28. Israel says he planned guerrilla raids and directed thekidnapping of Lt. Co. William R. Higgins, a U.S. Marine servingwith U.N peacekeepers, in February 1988.   Higgins' captors said they hanged him Monday in retaliation forthe abduction of Obeid, a spiritual leader of Hezbollah, thepro-Iranian group believed to be behind the kidnapings.   Several hours later, another group of kidnappers said they wouldkill American hostage Joseph Cicippio, 58, unless Obeid wasreleased. After two extensions of the deadline, the death threat toCicippio was suspended on Thursday in connection with several newdemands on Israel.   The kidnappers demanded the release of Obeid, as well asPalestinian and Lebanese guerrillas held in Israel. The group saidit would provide a list of names of all the captives it wantsreleased to the Red Cross.   Ahimeir reported ``all kinds of consultations'' within thegovernment about the hostage crisis.   Yossi Ben Aharon, a top aide to Shamir, said Israel was in``constant touch'' with the U.S. government, but he would not saywhether Shamir had talked by telephone with President Bush.   The Foreign Ministry summoned the ambassadors of West Germany,Italy and Britain, whose citizens are among the hostages inLebanon, and also the Japanese envoy.   Israel radio said the Japanese ambassador was called in becauseJapan was involved in contacts with Iran. The radio gave no detailsand ministry officials could not be reached for comment.   Italian Ambassador Alberto Leoncini Bartoli, asked later whetherhis government was in touch with Iran, replied: ``No. I only knowthat through the diplomatic channels there have been initiatives.''   He said other countries in the region were involved in thesecontacts, but ``to the best of my knowledge'' there has been noresponse.   ``My government has made approaches through diplomatic channelsto Iran, among other countries in the region. To my knowledge therehas been no response to these approaches yet.''   Aharon said Israel would not change its position on Obeid.   ``We took this gentleman for the purpose of releasing of ourthree prisoners, and this remains the objective,'' he said.   Higgins' captors released a poor-quality videotape of a man whoappeared to be the Marine colonel hanging from a gallows. There wasno way of telling when the tape was made, conflicting reports havearisen about when he was killed.   A Defense Ministry statement said Obeid told interrogators hebelieved Higgins was alive last week, but quoted him as saying hisevidence was hearsay.   The statement said Israel continued to believe Higgins waskilled late last year. Officials said they might give Obeid to alie-detector test to determine what he knew about the Americanofficer.</TEXT></DOC>
