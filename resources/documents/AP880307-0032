Edward J. King's $3.6million libel lawsuit against the Boston Globe.   The justices, over one dissenting vote, left intact aMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling that a jury should hearKing's contention that he was libeled by a Nov. 8, 1981, columnwritten by David Farrell, who since has left the newspaper.   The state court ruled that a jury might conclude that oneallegation in the column had been published with ``actual malice''_ a reckless disregard for the truth.   Justice William J. Brennan in November blocked a libel trial,and the full Supreme Court later refused to set aside Brennan'sorder.   Today's action set aside Brennan's trial-blocking order. Brennanvoted to hear arguments in the case but four votes are needed togrant such review.   King sued over various Globe articles and editorial cartoonspublished in 1981.   The state court threw out most of the ex-governor's claims inpretrial proceedings, but said a jury trial was needed regardingthe Farrell column. Both the Globe Newspaper Co. and Farrell werenamed as defendants.   In it, King was criticized for treating legislative and judicialfigures as if they were his employees.   ``That condescending attitude never was more evident than inOctober when King called a judge and demanded that he change adecision he rendered in a gang-rape case,'' the column said.   In a much-publicized case, the judge had given a suspendedprison sentence to five men who pleaded guilty to rape.   King's lawsuit said no such conversation between King and thejudge took place.   State Treasurer Robert Q. Crane, a King political ally, said inpretrial testimony that he was Farrell's source about King'stelephone call to the judge.   But the state's highest court noted that Farrell was not toldthat Crane had overheard the conversation, and that Farrell did notinvestigate further.   The court said a jury conceivably could conclude that Farrell'sfailure to do so amounted to actual malice.   Public figures who sue for libel must prove that the allegedlylibelous statement is false and was made with actual malice.Private citizens have a less stringent burden, and must prove onlythat the statement is false and was made negligently.   In a pretrial deposition, Farrell said he had no reason to doubtCrane's ``veracity and accuracy.''   In the appeal acted on today, Globe lawyers said theMassachusetts court ruling ``mutates actual malice into negligence,thus eviscerating'' the free-speech protections the Supreme Courthas built into libel law since 1964.   ``As long as writers are exposed to liability solely for theasserted inadequacies of their investigations, speech protectedunder the Constitution will be chilled,'' the newspaper's lawyerssaid. ``Stories for which reliable sources exist may beself-censored out of existence.''   But lawyers for King urged the court to reject the appeal andallow a jury trial on the libel allegation.   ``Farrell had obvious reasons to doubt the accuracy of Crane'sreport,'' they said.   The newspaper's appeal was supported in a``friend-of-the-court'' brief submitted by the American NewspaperPublishers Association, the American Society of Newspaper Editorsand other news organizations.   The case is Globe Newspaper Co. vs. King, 87-731.</TEXT></DOC>
