But the positive effect of the statement was limited, as many traders remained convinced that the White House still wouldn't mind a drop in the dollar's value.    &quot;They may not be actively talking the dollar down, or seeking a lower dollar, but they're not all that upset about seeing it lower,&quot; a dealer at Chemical Bank, New York, said.    Trading continued to be slow with the approach of the Christmas and New Year holidays -- except in Tokyo, where heavy dollar-selling orders reportedly prompted intervention by the Bank of Japan to support the U.S. currency. The Japanese central bank bought about $1 billion, according to traders' estimates.    The dollar fell to 126.80 Japanese yen and 1.6222 West German marks in Tokyo yesterday, eclipsing the post-1949 lows it reached Monday.    Traders described the dollar's gradual recovery in sluggish European trading as a technical correction of its earlier decline. It was helped by a sell-off of the British pound, which came under pressure from falling oil prices and a belief that the accord reached in Vienna this week by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries won't help stabilize the weak oil market. A continued drop in oil prices would reduce Britain's export revenue from North Sea crude.    The dollar stood at 1.6328 marks in late New York trading, up from 1.6307 late Monday. The British pound was off 0.5% at $1.8290, compared with $1.8382. The pound also fell to 2.9864 marks from 2.9976.    Although the dollar came back from its lows against the yen, it failed to reach its late Monday level against the Japanese currency and eased on the day to 127.67 yen from 127.93.    In Tokyo Wednesday morning, the dollar opened at 127.55 yen, then drifted down in slow trading to stand at 127.30 yen a short time later.    Large sell orders by Japanese commercial concerns kept the dollar from making a full recovery against the yen yesterday, according to Eishi Wakabayashi, head of currency trading in New York for Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru International Inc., a Tokyo-based investment house. He said he believes the dollar still can fall further against the yen.    &quot;The dollar-yen (rate) still has a lot of steam on the downside,&quot; Mr. Wakabayashi said. &quot;On the upside, the dollar's potential is very limited against the yen.&quot;    The statement that the White House isn't seeking a lower dollar came as trading had slowed to a snail's pace in New York. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there is no new U.S. policy regarding the dollar. &quot;We are not seeking a decline of the dollar,&quot; he said.    Mr. Fitzwater said Treasury Secretary James Baker is &quot;coordinating on a daily basis with our allies on monetary policy&quot; and said, &quot;One of our purposes is consistency.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $12.80 an ounce to $482.70 in heavy trading, reflecting weaker oil prices. Estimated volume was 6.5 million ounces.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Tuesday, Dec. 15, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
