Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita has warned the EC that it must keep &quot;its doors open to the outside world.&quot; And the U.S. has warned the Europeans, through Deputy Treasury Secretary M. Peter McPherson, that Washington considers their plan to curb American access to the 12-nation community &quot;unacceptable.&quot;    At this point, it is too early to tell what concrete actions Japan may take if it feels threatened by the EC. But in the U.S. the battle lines are drawn, with a spanking-new trade bill designed to give the executive branch more power to retaliate to whatever it views as unfair competition. But there is another weapon in the U.S. trade arsenal -- one suggested by President Reagan himself.    In the wake of the Jan. 2 signing of the U.S.-Canada trade agreement by the president and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, a Reagan trade official recalled that the president had once asked at a cabinet meeting: &quot;If the Europeans can create a Common Market, why can't we?&quot; And to further stress the president's commitment to closer ties with the U.S.'s nearest trading partners, during the first 10 days of January U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter announced a series of agreements with Mexico covering a variety of American products and Mexican steel and textile products.    Indeed, despite all the negotiating difficulties, a strong case can be made not only for a Canada-U.S.-Mexico market, but also for a truly integrated North American Common Market that would include the six republics of the Central American isthmus. The reason why a NACM should be established sooner rather than later should be self-evident. With a supercharged Japan and a burgeoning European Common Market flexing their economic muscles, the time has come for a radical change in U.S. foreign and economic policies vis-a-vis the rest of the globe.    According to government-issued figures, the combined GNP for the current 12-member Common Market is $2,605.2 billion (combined population, 323.6 million). That of the 10-member Eastern bloc Comecon is $2,831.1 billion (population, 471.1 million). But the combined estimated GNP of the projected NACM would be about $4,734.9 billion, with a population of 361.3 million. Yet, these statistics barely serve to indicate some of the more obvious advantages of the proposed NACM.    A NACM alliance would bring together nine neighboring countries with such a wealth and diversity of technological and natural resources as to practically constitute an independent economic unit, capable of surviving with almost no need for outside raw materials in times of international crisis. Neither Japan, the EC nor Comecon is so fortunate, relying as they do on far-flung trading partners for much of their national needs.    The Canadians, who have always been wary of bilateral agreements with the U.S. for fear of being somehow &quot;swallowed up&quot; or &quot;swamped&quot; by the economic power and the culture of their more numerous American cousins, could count on the inclusion of the 100-odd million Mexican and Central American member-partners to dilute the centrifugal force of the U.S. industrial dynamo. And economically, they would benefit, too, from expanded trade with, and new investment opportunities in, their new-found sister states.    For the Mexicans and Central Americans, the more obvious benefits would be economic. With their countries opened up to Canadian and U.S. investors, there would be jobs aplenty to keep them busily working at home, with the chance at last to improve the quality of their lives without the risks, uncertainties and humiliations of illegal immigration. But there would also be social and political benefits; as the people's standard of living improved, so, too, would the quality of government. What leader, would want to risk the censure of the NACM community at large -- and thus lose for his people their slice of the North American pie?    And for the U.S., the benefits would not only be economic, but also of immense spiritual value. Here, at last, would be the opportunity to wipe out all of the animosities and injustices of the past. The so-called 19th-century &quot;rape of Mexico,&quot; the military occupation of Nicaragua (1912-33), other incursions into Mexico and Central America in this century, the memories of U.S. gunboat diplomacy -- all would be forgiven, if not entirely forgotten, by the opportunities and changed relationships created by the new reality of the NACM.    And, finally, since there would be no room in a free-enterprise system such as the proposed NACM for a ramshackle Marxist regime such as that of Nicaragua, the other potential Latin American member-states could surely be counted on to bring about the peaceful dismantling of the Soviet satellite in their midst -- most likely without firing a shot. And the establishment of the NACM would take the punch away from other Central American guerrilla movements.    It may not be easy to bring about President Reagan's dream of a far-reaching NACM, but it is one hell of an idea to be considered by our next president.    ---   Mr. Rangel is a Central American-born writer and editor at an international accounting and consulting firm. </TEXT></DOC>
