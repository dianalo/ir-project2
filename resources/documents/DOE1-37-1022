Chronic exposure tothese substances in concentrations exceeding the stipulated permissiblevalues (Threshold limit values) has been proved to result in a sizablepercentage of the exposed workers suffering from typical occupationaldiseases. Added to these, is the hazard due to noise which is prevalentin practically all work situations. Realizing these hazards, the Govt.of India had, long back, incorporated provisions in the Factories Actto protect the workers from such hazards. One such provision is thatsome occupational diseases have been listed as notifiable diseases andwhenever any medical practitioner or any employer comes across a caseof any of these diseases, he should report it to the authorities. However,surprisingly very few cases have been thus reported so far. This doesnot mean that the pollution in the working environments in the factorieshas been controlled and the occupational health of workers has been takencare of. In fact, the environmental evaluation in different categoriesof industries by various agencies in the country has shown the prevalenceof high concentrations of these substances in the work room environments.</TEXT></DOC>
