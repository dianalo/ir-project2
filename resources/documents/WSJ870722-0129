He never had a hit record. Yet today's pop charts are showing that he is one of the few musicians from the &quot;psychedelic '60s&quot; to leave an enduring mark on American culture.    Two of this month's Top 10 albums pay him a direct personal tribute. And a score of today's most promising young talents single him out as their inspiration. Parsons, a handsome, upper-class hippie born in Waycross, Ga., and educated, briefly, at Harvard, was the first successfully to blend pure country music with the late '60s &quot;youth culture.&quot; His influence is growing steadily with young performers trying to recapture the honky-tonk and gospel flavor of country music from the years before Nashville became synonymous with slick commercialism.    Ironically, this saint of the return to tradition himself died from the personal excesses of the '60s rock scene. His hagiography sometimes contains a morbid strain. Today's No. 2 album, by the Irish rock band U2, is named &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; for the California desert town where Parsons succumbed, apparently to a drug overdose.    But his musical brilliance, his true legacy, lies behind another best seller, the album &quot;Trio,&quot; featuring three of the country's leading female singers -- Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt and Dolly Parton. Harris's brief but intense attachment to Parsons is the motivating force behind the record. The women perform traditional country numbers backed entirely by acoustic (nonelectric) stringed instruments. Something noteworthy has happened when a collection of gospel, Grand Ole Opry and Appalachian ethnic melodies not only hits No. 1 on Billboard's country chart and goes gold (sells more than 500,000 copies) within 11 weeks, but also ranks sixth on Rolling Stone magazine's survey of &quot;rock-oriented record stores.&quot;    Parsons's posthumous influence is especially remarkable considering the brevity of his career. In 1968, Parsons joined the Byrds, a rock group famous for its Bob Dylan material but then adrift in science-fiction lyrics and electronic noise. Along with an original Byrds singer, Chris Hillman, he turned the group to country music, taking it on a pilgrimage to Nashville to record the now-famous album &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo.&quot;    Shortly after, Parsons and Hillman left to form the Flying Burrito Brothers. Hillman, now touring with his own Burrito-inspired Desert Rose Band, recalls that the original group was so ahead of its time that &quot;we starved for three albums.&quot;    Parsons secured his personal reputation in 1972 with two brilliant albums (one, &quot;Grievous Angel,&quot; released posthumously) recorded with Emmylou Harris and his own band, the Fallen Angels. His voice was as erratic as his life, cracking and soaring. But his songs were unforgettable, a distinctive blend of beautiful straightforward melody and taut imagery bordering on the surreal.    He also made a deep personal impression on converts like Harris, a folk singer when he met her in 1972. Harris has kept his memory alive through her own 14 albums, the latest of which, &quot;Angel Band,&quot; is, like &quot;Trio,&quot; entirely acoustical. A generation of Parsons alumni has played in her Hot Band, in turn encouraging traditionalists like Ricky Skaggs, songwriters like Rodney Crowell and newcomers like Sweethearts of the Rodeo. Parsons has influenced artists from England's Elvis Costello to New York's Tom Russell to California's Sid Griffin, leader of the group Long Ryders (whose current album is now in the top 10 on college radio). Griffin has even written a biography of Parsons.    But the sanctification of Parsons shouldn't be allowed to obscure the way he dissipated his enormous gifts even before his sordid death. &quot;Gram was a real talented guy and a wonderful songwriter,&quot; recalls Hillman, at one point Parsons's housemate and collaborator on some of his best songs. &quot;He just lacked one thing -- the discipline. He was seduced by the trappings.&quot;    It's also true that Parsons didn't work alone in reviving country music. His ideas succeeded because, in Southern California, he could draw on instrumentalists already deeply imbued with the original country tradition. A number of rock musicians in the Byrds and Burrito Brothers had a schizophrenic existence, performing with groups like Country Gazette and the Dillard and Clark Expedition in the flourishing Los Angeles bluegrass scene.    California suburbs, explains Hillman, were settled in the '30s and postwar '40s by emigrants from the Midwest and Dust Bowl Southwest. Says Hillman, &quot;They brought their music with them.&quot; Bakersfield, center of the Okie migration, became a major recording center for Buck Owens and Merle Haggard, who developed a regional, Mexican-influenced country sound all of their own.    In this fusion of country and rock, it's the country tradition that has proved more durable. The public is increasingly sending the traditionalists to the top of the pop charts. But the source of this music rarely comes across through the mass media. Says Harris, concluding an interview, &quot;People talk a lot about Gram Parsons, and they write a lot about Gram Parsons, but you never hear Gram Parsons on the radio.&quot;    ---   Mr. Adams is a former Journal editorialist. </TEXT></DOC>
