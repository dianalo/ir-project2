(tape automated bondinginterconnection technology)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Bindra, Ashok.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Digital Equipment Corp (DEC) is using tape automated bonding (TAB)for interconnection of VLSI chips with more than 200 pins in thefirm's new VAX 6000 Model 400 minicomputers.andP;  DEC selected TABinterconnections because the technology is more cost-effective forhigh pin counts, offers higher clock speeds, supports a finer pinpitch than previous techniques, enables circuits to be tested ontape before mounting on the substrate, and will support theinterconnection performance that will be required by the nextgeneration of VLSI technology and computer systems.andP;  DEC workedwith the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corpconsortium's packaging and interconnection program to develop theTAB implementation.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Digital Equipment Corp.
