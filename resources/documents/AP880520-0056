The Contras, as the rebels are known, also disagreed on Thursdaywith a Sandinista government statement that a third round of peacetalks has been scheduled. The government reported Wednesday thatnegotiators would meet May 25-28.   Contra leaders said they would prefer the talks resume today inthe Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Guatemala or Mexico.   The government statement said the site of the talks wasundecided, but that the Sandinistas proposed that they take placein Managua, where two rounds of negotiations have been held.   The U.S.-backed Contras complained that during the previoussessions the government forced them to remain in a hotel near theinternational airport and prevented them from meeting with internalopposition leaders.   In their statement Thursday, the Contras said they would returnto Managua only if the government agreed to ``suspend allcensorship of communications media and end the threats andmistreatment by Sandinista officials against independentbroadcasters.''   The statement, read to The Associated Press by telephone fromMiami, said the Contras should be allowed to meet local oppositionleaders and make their case on radio and television.   The government said Wednesday it would allow the rebels to meetwith the main opposition group, the Nicaraguan DemocraticCoordinate, at the hotel where they stayed before. The rebels wantto stay at a more centrally located site.   Negotiations are aimed at reaching a permanent truce in thecivil war, which began in November 1981. The two sides signed anagreement on March 23 for a 60-day cease-fire that expires May 30.   Negotiators have been unable to work out details for a permanenttruce, although they have agreed on seven zones where the rebelsare to gather during a cease-fire.   The two sides remain far apart on such issues as democraticreforms and what role Contra leaders will play in Nicaragua'spolitical future.   In another development, the Reagan administration on Thursdayannounced approval of a $10 million grant to monitor compliancewith the Nicaraguan peace process.   In San Jose, Costa Rica, Contra rebel leader Alfredo Cesar saida recent split in Contra ranks over the military leadership of Col.Enrique Bermudez has been resolved.   Cesar, a director of the Contra umbrella group, the Miami-basedNicaraguan Resistance, said: ``The internal military conflictprovoked by several commanders now has been overcome and Col.Bermudez was confirmed in his job as supreme military chief of ourforces.''   There were reports late last week that up to 4,000 Contraguerrillas gathered around a base camp in Yamales, 20 miles northof the Honduran border, to protest Bermudez' command.   Sources had said some rebels charged Bermudez with corruptionand inefficiency.   Cesar said there were only about 200 dissidents at the base camp.   ``I can guarantee 100 percent that our troops are now unifiedagain and support the directorship of the Nicaraguan Resistance inthe negotations that we have with the Sandinista government,'' saidCesar.</TEXT></DOC>
