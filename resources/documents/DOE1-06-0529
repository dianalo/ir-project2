Thephenomenon of coal solvent swelling is being used to characterize coalstructure especially in the determination of molecular sizes betweencrosslinks. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) is the approach usedin this study to examine the changes in pore structure in a PittsburghNo. 8 seam hvA bituminous coal, Argonne Premium Coal Sample No. 4. Twoperdeuterated solvents are used, benzene for non-swollen and pyridinefor swelling conditions. The deuterated solvent provides a large contrastbetween the solvent and the solid coal for neutron scattering. Our currentresults show that the pore structure of a coal swollen in pyridine isdramatically altered from its original state. 8 refs., 4 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
