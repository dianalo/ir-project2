Background </ITAG>Generally, medical services are furnished to a Medicare beneficiary byproviders, physicians, and suppliers. Title XVIII of the Social SecurityAct (the Act) defines the term physician, just as it defines the termsprovider and supplier. Under section 1861(r) of the Act, the term physician,subject to limitations concerning the scope of practice by each State andother provisions of title XVIII of the Act, means a doctor of_(1) Medicineor osteopathy; (2) Dental surgery or dental medicine; (3) Podiatry; (4)Optometry; or (5) Chiropractic. In general, payment for physician services furnished directly to a beneficiaryis made under Part B of the Medicare program (Supplementary Medical Insurance).After furnishing physician services to a beneficiary, billing and paymentare generally made in one of two ways. A physician may bill the beneficiarydirectly or some other person or entity on behalf of the beneficiary. Thatperson or entity then seeks reimbursement from Medicare. Altenatively,a physician may bill Medicare directly for his or her services furnishedto the beneficiary. When a physician or other supplier agrees to acceptthe amount the carrier determines to be the reasonable charge as paymentin full, it is called ``assignment'' or accepting payment on ``an assignment-relatedbasis.'' In this case, the physician can bill the beneficiary only forapplicable deductible and coinsurance amounts. Rules concerning assignmentare located at 42 CFR 424.55. A physician who bills Medicare for payment submits a Health Insurance ClaimForm (HCFA-1500) directly to a Medicare carrier who then processes theclaim. This form, which is also used by most third-party payors, includingMedicaid and other Federal government health insurance programs, is, ineffect, an itemized bill. If a physician is not to be paid directly byMedicare for physician services, the physician generally bills the Medicarebeneficiary directly (or bills another third-party payor). The beneficiarythen seeks reimbursement from Medicare for payment made to the physicianby submitting a Patient's Request for Medicare Payment (HCFA-1490 S) tothe carrier. This form directs the beneficiary to attach itemized billsfrom his or her physician to the form. In cases in which a third partyhas made payment to the physician, the third party seeks reimbursementfrom Medicare for this payment by submitting a Request for Medicare Paymentby Organizations which Qualify to Receive Payment for Paid Bills (HCFA-1490U). We require that the physician fill out Part II of this form, whichis similar to an itemized bill. Currently, each bill or request for payment for physician sevices furnishedto a Medicare beneficiary must include, among other information, a narrativedescription of the diagnosis of the nature of the illness or injury forwhich the beneficiary received care. Although there is no current requirementfor diagnostic coding (that is, a description of the diagnosis or the natureof the illness or injury in a numeric code), many physicians have routinelyprovided this information. In addition, all physicians currently providea narrative description of procedures, medical services, and supplies thatare furnished to a beneficiary and many physicians also furnish procedurecodes for these activities. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. New Legislation </ITAG>Section 202(g) of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (Pub.L. 100-360), enacted July 1, 1988, added paragraph (p) to section 1842of the Act. Under the provisions of new section 1842(p)(1) of the Act,each bill or request for payment for physician services under MedicarePart B must include appropriate diagnostic coding ``as established by theSecretary'' for the narrative diagnosis or the nature of the illness orinjury for which the Medicare beneficiary received treatment. The conferencereport that accompanied Pub. L. 100-360 explained clearly the purpose ofthe requirement for physician diagnostic coding. After rejecting a Senateprovision that would have required the use of diagnosis codes on all prescriptionsbecause the conferees decided that that requirement would have been ``undulyburdensome,'' the conferees agreed to require diagnostic coding for physicianservices under Part B, explaining their reasoning for this requirementas follows:``This information would be available for immediate use for utilizationreview of physician services (and could be used for prepayment screens)and could be used in the future to facilitate drug utilization review bymerging Part B with drug claims data.'' H.R. Rep. No. 661, 100th Cong.,2nd Sess. 191 (1988).Section 1842(p)(2) of the Act provides for denial of payment for a billsubmitted by a physician on an assignment-related basis if it does notinclude the appropriate diagnostic coding. Section 1842(p)(3) of the Actdirects the Secretary to impose penalties if a physician who is not paidon an assignment-related basis fails to provide the appropriate diagnosticcoding on the bill to the Medicare beneficiary. That is, section 1842(p)(3(A)of the Act provides for a civil money penalty not to exceed $2,000 if thephysician knowingly and willfully fails to provide the appropriate diagnosticcoding, and section 1842(p)(3)(B) of the Act provides for a sanction under1842(j)(2)(A) of the Act if the physician ``knowingly, willfully, and inrepeated cases fails, after being notified by the Secretary of the obligationsand requirements of this subsection,'' to furnish appropriate diagnosticcoding. Section 1842(p)(3) of the Act does not prohibit the payment ofan unassigned claim simply because the physician did not provide diagnosiscodes. Section 202(m)(4) of Pub. L. 100-360 provides that new paragraph1842(p) of the Act will apply to physician services furnished after March31, 1989.This proposed rule concerns the requirements related to the provisionsof section 1842(p)(1) and (p)(2) of the Act. In the Department of Healthand Human Services, the responsibility for both civil money penalties andsanctions has been delegated to the Office of Inspector General (OIG).The OIG is currently developing a separate rulemaking document concerningcivil money penalties under section 1842(p)(3)(A) of the Act and sanctionsunder section 1842(p)(3)(B) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Provisions of this Proposed Rule</ITAG>Under the provisions of new section 1842(p)(1) of the Act, each bill orrequest for payment for physician services under Part B must include appropriatediagnostic coding ``as established by the Secretary'' that relates to thenarrative description of the diagnosis or the nature of the illness orinjury for which the Medicare beneficiary received care.Noted above, generally, physician services furnished directly to a beneficiaryare paid under Medicare Part B. (In addition, under the regulations setforth at Subpart D of 42 CFR Part 405, we make payments to hospitals underPart A for physician services related to the supervision and teaching ofinterns and residents who participate in the care of hospital inpatients.Rules concerning bills for these Part A physician services would not beaffected by this proposed rule.)Under this proposed rule, a physician would be required to furnish diagnosiscodes in lieu of the narrative description that a physician is currentlyrequired to furnish. Payment would be denied for a claim for physicianservices furnished on an assignment-related basis if the claim did notcontain appropriate diagnostic coding. This would not be true for a claimfor physician services not furnished on an assignment-related basis. Inother words, the beneficiary's submission of a claim for the payment forphysician services would not be denied solely because the claim did notcontain diagnostic coding. If enough information is provided to enablea carrier to process the claim, the claim would be processed without thediagnostic coding. (As explained above, section 1842(p)(3)(B) of the Actprovides for a sanction under section 1842(j)(2)(A) of the Act if the physician``knowingly, willfully, and in repeated cases fails, after being notifiedby the Secretary of the obligations and requirements of this subsection,''to furnish appropriate diagnostic coding.) To aid in implementation, alimited grace period will be established during which payment will notbe denied and sanctions will not be imposed for failure to include diagnosiscodes.To implement the provisions of section 1842(p)(1) of the Act, we must determinewhich system should be used to code diagnoses and provide direction tophysicians for use of that coding system with our claim forms. We are proposingto use the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, ClinicalModification (ICD-9-CM). (The Tenth Revision of ICD would not automaticallybe used. Instead, we would announce our use of that or any other subsequentrevision.)We have chosen ICD-9-CM as the most appropriate diagnostic coding systembecause it is the only nationally recognized coding system that includesall possible diagnoses for Medicare beneficiaries. It is for that reasonthat it is already widely used by physicians. Other coding systems arelimited to medical specialties. For example, the American Psychiatric Associationpublishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, ThirdEdition, Revised (DSM-III-R), which contains a coding syustem that is limitedto mental disorders. (Although all DSM-III-R codes are based on ICD-9-CMcodes, there are variations between the two systems.) (Although the manyphysicians who currently furnish procedure codes use the American MedicalAssociation's Physicians' Current Procedural Terminology, Fourth Edition(commonly referred to as CPT-4), this system cannot be used for diagnosticcoding because it contains procedure codes only.)We are already using ICD-9-CM in the Medicare program for classifying DiagnosisRelated Groups (DRGs) for payment under the inpatient hospital prospectivepayment system. That is, cases are classified into DRGs based on the principaldiagnosis, up to four additional diagnoses, and certain procedures performedduring the hospital stay, as well as age, sex, and discharge status ofthe patient.The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) isa classification system developed by the World Health Organization forrecording morbidity and mortality information for statistical purposes,for indexing hospital records by diseases, and for storing and retrievingdata. The clinical modification to ICD-9 (that is, ICD-9-CM) is a codingsystem for reporting diagnostic information and procedures performed ona patient in hospitals or connected with other types of health care deliverysystems.ICD-9-CM was developed under the guidance of the National Center for HealthStatistics (NCHS) to adapt the ICD-9 classification system to the needsof hospitals in the United States. The modifications were intended to providea mechanism to present a clinical picture of the patient. Thus, ICD-9-CMcodes are more precise than those included in ICD-9 since greater precisionis needed to describe the clinical picture of a patient than for statisticalgroupings and trend analysis.Effective January 1979, after nearly two years of development by numerousnational experts on clinical technical matters, the ICD-9-CM became thesingle classification system intended for use by hospitals in the UnitedStates. This system replaced several earlier related but somewhat dissimilarclassification systems. Once the ICD-9-CM classification system was inplace, several errors and omissions were noted. Consequently, in September1980 a second edition of ICD-9-CM was published. The preface to the secondedition noted that the continuous maintenance of ICD-9-CM is the responsibilityof the Federal government. The preface also stated that no future modificationsto ICD-9-CM would be made by the Federal government without consideringthe opinions of representatives of major users of the classification system.In September 1985, the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee(the committee) was formed. This is a Federal interdepartmental committeethat maintains and updates the ICD-9-CM. This includes approving new codingchanges, developing errata, addenda, and other modifications to the ICD-9-CMto reflect newly developed procedures and technologies and newly identifieddiseases. The committee is also responsible for promoting the use of Federaland non-Federal educational programs and other communication techniqueswith a view toward standardizing coding applications and upgrading thequality of the classification system.The committee is co-chaired by NCHS and HCFA. NCHS has primary responsibilityfor the ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes included in Volume 1_Diseases: TabularList and Volume 2_Diseases: Alphabetic Index. HCFA has primary responsibilityfor the ICD-9-CM procedure codes included in Volume 3_Procedures: TabularList and Alphabetic Index.The committee encourages participation in the development of diagnosisand procedure codes by health-related organizations, organizations in thecoding field, and other members of the public. During each Federal fiscalyear (FY), the Committee holds three public meetings during which codingchanges are discussed. (For example, the Committee presented proposalsfor coding changes for FY 1990 at public meetings held on April 14, 1988,July 21-22, 1988, and December 1-2, 1988.) Taking into account the publiccomments made at each meeting and the public correspondence received within30 days after each meeting, the committee then formulates recommendations,which must be approved by the co-chair agency heads (that is, the Administratorof HCFA and the Director of NCHS) before adoption for general use.Coding changes approved by the committee and agency heads are publishedannually in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (see 53 FR 38590, September 30, 1988, for changesconcerning diagnosis and procedure codes that became effective on October1, 1988).Only these official volumes and addenda as published by GPO are to be consideredin the assignment of diagnosis codes for Medicare patients. (That is, weare not responsible for mistakes made by businesses in the replicationof these official volumes and addenda, which are then sold to the public.)Three official addenda became effective on the following dates: October1, 1986, October 1, 1987, and October 1, 1988. A fourth addendum, containingthe Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection Codes, became effectivefor Medicare patients discharged on or after July 1, 1988.The GPO has exhausted its supply of these addenda and has no plans to reprintmore copies. In addition, we expect that changes to the ICD-9-CM codingsystem will continue to be published each October 1st. However, GPO willno longer provide addenda except to purchasers of the 3rd edition. Therefore,for physicians to comply with the requirements of this rule, they shouldobtain Volumes 1 and 2 of ICD-9-CM, third edition. The third edition waspublished in March 1989. It incorporates all four addenda that were previouslypublished. Therefore, if a physician has not yet obtained ICD-9-CM, secondedition, and updated the set with the addenda, the physician should obtainthe recently updated Volumes 1 and 2 (that include the four addenda). Anynew addenda issued through 1991 will automatically be sent without chargeto anyone who orders the recently updated Volumes 1 and 2. (Although thesefuture addenda will not be furnished by the GPO to anyone other than topurchasers of ICD-9-CM, third edition, both the American Medical RecordsAssociation (AMRA), the national professional association of medical recordspractitioners, and the American Hospital Association (AHA) have indicatedthat they intend to reprint these future addenda and make them availablefor sale.)The price of Volumes 1 and 2 of ICD-9-CM, third edition is $43.00 for deliverywithin the United States and $53.75 for delivery outside of the UnitedStates. A purchaser must furnish an address other than a post office boxbecause the volumes will be delivered only to a place of business or aresidence. When ordering, the purchaser should enclose a check, money order,or Visa or Mastercard account name, number, and expiration date. Checksshould be made out to the Superintendent of Documents.Updated volumes 1 and 2 may be purchased by writing to the following address_<ITAG tagnum="15">ICD-9-CM, 3rd Edition, Volumes 1 and 2, P.O. Box 360121, Pittsburgh,PA 15250-6121</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(Telephone orders may not be made.)</ITAG>Section 424.32 sets forth the basic requirements for all claims. UnderandSection; 424.32(a), all claims (including claims filed directly with Medicareby physicians and claims filed by beneficiaries or other persons or entitiesfor physician services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries) must be filedin accordance with HCFA instructions. Section 424.34 provides additionalrequirements for claims filed with Medicare by beneficiaries. Under andSection;424.34(b)(4), the itemized bill must include a listing of services in sufficientdetail to permit determination of reasonable charges. We would revise andSection;424.32(a) to state specifically that a claim for physician services mustinclude appropriate diagnostic coding using ICD-9-CM. We would revise andSection;424.34(b)(4) to state specifically that an itemized bill furnished by aphysician to a beneficiary for physician services must include appropriatediagnostic coding using ICD-9-CM. In addition, we would add the definitionof ICD-9-CM, the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,Clinical Modification, to andSection; 424.3.Procedures and other instructions for diagnostic coding were developedin order to take into account circumstances unique to care furnished byphysicians. These procedures and other instructions for completing billsand requests for payment were distributed to the carriers on March 3, 1989.The carriers then mailed this information, in the form of a Medicare Bulletin,to the physicians that they service. During preparation of these proceduresand other instructions, we consulted with the American Medical Association(AMA) and provided them with an opportunity to comment on the material.We considered all of AMA's comments and made changes where appropriate.(For the convenience of the reader, we have republished the coding andreporting requirements as an appendix to this proposed rule.) If additionalcoding requirements are developed, they will also be distributed to thephysicians.Currently, there are a number of organizations and individuals that publishcoding advice. The only publication endorsed by HCFA is Coding Clinic forICD-9-CM (Coding Clinic), published by AHA for use by hospitals. CodingClinic provides specific diagnostic information and guidelines that arehelpful for determining proper diagnostic coding. For example, a recentissue of Coding Clinic contained an article about sepsis and septic shockthat included significant pointers for coding these cases. (Although thearticles in Coding Clinic are about diagnostic coding or procedure codinginvolving hospital inpatients or outpatients, this periodical containsinformation that may be helpful for coding involving physician servicesfurnished in any setting.)In 1985, the Editorial Advisory Board of Coding Clinic identified fourorganizations whose representatives have responsibility for review andapproval of the contents of this publication. These four cooperating organizationsare AMRA, AHA, HCFA, and NCHS. Because the Department has reviewed andapproved all articles published in Coding Clinic since the May-June 1985issue, users of Coding Clinic may assume that the written material is consistentwith our position on coding.

Regulatory Impact Analysis</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisExecutive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish aregulatory impact analysis for any proposed rule that meets one of theE.O. 12291 criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, the rule would likelyresult in_<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.</ITAG>In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis thatis consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through612) unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed rule would not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.For purposes of the RFA, all physicians are treated as small entities.We are preparing a voluntary regulatory impact analysis and voluntary regulatoryflexibility analysis because of our inability to quantify with any degreeof certainty the estimated costs of these provisions, and because of thelarge number of physicians who would be affected and the significance andpotential controversy of these provisions. This proposed rule would implement some of the provisions of section 202(g)of Pub. L. 100-360. These provisions require that each bill or requestfor payment for a service furnished by a physician include appropriatediagnostic coding related to the illness or injury for which the Medicarebeneficiary received care. A physician who is to be paid on an assignment-relatedbasis would not be paid if he or she failed to include appropriate diagnosticcoding on the bill. (As stated above, the Department's OIG is currentlydeveloping a separate rulemaking document concerning civil money penaltiesunder section 1842(p)(3)(A) of the Act and sanctions under section 1842(p)(3)(B)of the Act applicable when a physician who is not accepting assignmentintentionally fails to furnish diagnostic coding on the bill submittedto his or her patient.) With one exception, any effects of this proposed rule would be a directresult of the legislative provisions in section 202(g) of Pub. L. 100-360.The exception is that the legislation allows us discretion in the choiceof which system should be used to code diagnoses. We are proposing to useICD-9-CM because it is the only nationally recognized coding system thatincludes all possible diagnoses for Medicare beneficiaries. It is for thatreason that it is already widely used by physicians. Furthermore, we arealready using ICD-9-CM in the Medicare program for classifying DRGs forpayment under the inpatient hospital prospective payment system. Therefore,we believe that it would be the easiest coding system for physicians touse. Currently, physicians are not required to provide ICD-9-CM or any othertype of diagnostic codes on their Medicare bills or requests for payment.Therefore, we believe that most physicians would be affected by the provisionsof this proposed rule through increased paperwork, the cost of trainingthemselves and their staff, and the probable need to purchase ICD-9-CM,third edition. As of December 31, 1986, there were 569,160 physicians practicing in theUnited States (Physician Characteristics and Distribution in the U.S.,1986. Department of Data Release Services, Division of Survey and DataResources, American Medical Association, 1987). We believe that at least30 percent of physicians are currently reporting ICD-9-CM codes, thus the70 percent of the physicians not reporting codes equals approximately 398,000.If all of these physicians need new coding books, ICD-9-CM Volumes 1 and2 at a cost of $43.00 per set, the total cost would be approximately $17,100,000.However, we believe that not all of these physicians would purchase newcoding books. For example, some physicians may be in a group practice,some may work for hospitals and would not have thier own patients, whilesome may already own coding books. Based on claims data, we project that there will be approximately 320.1million physician claims processed for the period from April 1, 1989 toMarch 31, 1990. We estimate the clerical cost of coding each claim to be$0.075 for a total of $24,007,500. We arrived at the $0.075 figure be assumingan hourly rate of the typical physician's office staff person to be $4.50per hour. We believe that it takes one minute to code a claim, therefore$4.50 divided by 60 minutes equals $0.075. However, we believe that approximately30 percent of the claims are already being coded. Thus, 70 percent or approximately$16,800,000 of the cost of coding of claims could be attributed to thisproposed rule. These coding costs would be ongoing. However, we believethat coding time and costs would probably be reduced with experience. We are aware that AMRA and other vendors are sponsoring, for a fee, codingtraining for physicians' office staff. Additionally, carrier-sponsoredtraining will be available at no cost. Of the 70 percent of physicianswho do not currently code, we anticipate that each of those physiciansmay either send one or more persons for training, or may determine thatformal training is not needed. Some of those physicians may not send anystaff since they may be in a group practice (in which case, one staff membermay represent several physicians), or may work for hospitals and not havetheir own patients. Below, we are providing a range of estimated training costs through theuse of two examples. The first example gives a higher estimate; the second,a lower. In the first example, we assume that all physicians who currently do notcode would, on average, send one of their office staff to attend a half-daysession sponsored by a national firm. We anticipate that the cost of sucha training session could be as high as $100.00. Thus, for this estimate,we are assuming a cost of $100.00. Furthermore, we assume they would paythe hourly rate (assumed to the $4.50 per hour) of their employees whilethey are attending the coding session. Given these assumptions, we wouldestimate training costs as follows: (All estimates are rounded to the nearest $100.000.) <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s50,9</C>  <H1>  </H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">andbullet; Half-day (four hours) at $4.50 per hour=$18.00.

The cost of books wouldbe a one-time expense. Training costs would be recurring to the extentthat staff turnover would occur. Coding costs would be ongoing. However,we believe that coding time and costs would probably be reduced with experience.In conclusion, we do not know how the physician community would react tothis proposed rule insofar as the extent to which they would utilize codingtraining for their office staff. Thus, we cannot with any accuracy estimatethe costs involved. B. Rural Hospital Impact Statement Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatoryimpact analysis if a proposed rule would have a significant impact on theoperations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysismust conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposesof section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospitalwith fewer than 50 beds located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area.As discussed above, only physicians would be affected by this proposedrule. Therefore, we are not preparing a rural impact statement since wehave determined, and the Secretary certifies that this proposed rule wouldnot have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantialnumber of small rural hospitals. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Other Required Information </ITAG>A. Paperwork Reduction Act Proposed regulations at andSection;andSection; 424.32(a) and 424.34(b) containinformation collection and recordkeeping requirements that are subjectto review by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 through 3511). These proposed regulations andthe information collection and recordkeeping requirements apply to therequirement that a physician provide appropriate diagnostic coding on eachbill or request for payment for a physician service furnished under MedicarePart B. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average one minute per submitted Part B claim. This includes time spentreviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering andmaintaining needed data, and completing and reviewing the collection ofinformation. The information collection and recordkeeping requirementsassociated with this proposed rule have been sent to the Office of Managementand Budget for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Organizationsand individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collectionand recordkeeping requirements should direct them to the OMB official whosename appears in the ``ADDRESS'' section of this preamble. B. Public Comment Because of the large number of pieces of correspondence we normally receiveon a proposed rule, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually.However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date specifiedin the ``Dates'' section of this preamble, and we will respond to the commentsin the preamble of the final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 42 CFR 424 </ITAG>Assignment of benefits, Physician certification, Claims for payment, Emergencyservices, Plan of treatment. 42 CFR Part 424 would be amended as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 424_CONDITIONS FOR MEDICARE PAYMENT</ITAG>A.

Coding and Reporting Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Use of ICD-9-CM:</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For information about the use of certain abbreviations, punctuation,symbols, and other conventions used in the ICD-9-CM Tabular List (the volumewith the code numbers and titles) see the sections on Conventions Usedin the Tabular List and guidance in the use of ICD-9-CM at the beginningof Volume 1. Information about the correct sequence to use in finding acode is described in the Introduction of Volume 2, Diseases: AlphabeticIndex. The most critical rule involves beginning the search for the correctcode assignment through the Index, Volume 2. Never begin searching initiallyin the Tabular List (Volume 1) as this will lead to coding errors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Physicians must use the appropriate code or codes from 001.0 throughV82.9 to identify diagnoses, symptoms, conditions, problems, complaints,or other reason(s) for the encounter/visit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. In reporting ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, physicians will be describingthe patient's condition using terminology which includes specific diagnosesas well as symptoms, problems, or reasons for the encounter. There areICD-9-CM codes to describe all of these.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In selecting codes to describe the reason for the encounter the physicianwill frequently be using codes 001.0 through 999.9 which is the sectionICD-9-CM for the classification of diseases and injuries (e.g. infectiousand parasitic diseases; neoplasms; symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions,etc.). Codes that describe symptoms and signs, as opposed to diagnoses,are acceptable for reporting purposes if this is the level of certaintydocumented by the physician. Chapter 16 of ICD-9-CM, Symptoms, Signs, andIll-defined Conditions (code 780.0-799.9) contains many, but not all codesfor symptoms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. However, ICD-9-CM also provides codes to deal with encounters forcircumstances other than a disease or injury. This Supplememtary Classificationof Factors Influencing Health Status and Contact with Health Services (V01.0-V82.9)is provided to deal with occasions when circumstances other than a diseaseor injury are recorded as diagnoses or problems. The V codes should beused for bills of this type. For example, the correct code for a cancerpatient who is seen solely for radiotherapy is V58.0, Radiotherapy session.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. List first the ICD-9-CM code for the diagnosis, condition, problem,or other reason for encounter/visit shown in the medical record to be chieflyresponsible for the services provided. List additional codes that describeany coexisting conditions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Physicians will be reporting up to four diagnosis codes, not narrativedescriptors, on the billing form. In addition, they will indicate whichdiagnosis code relates to the service(s) reported. The physician must selectamong the four diagnosis codes to be reported that code which best describesthe reason for the encounter, as discussed above. At times there may beseveral conditions that equally led to the encounter. In these cases thephysician is free to select the one to be listed first.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The physician will be reporting a minimum of one diagnosis code. However,there will frequently be instances where the patient has greater than fourconditions present at the time of the encounter. Bill limitations allowthe reporting of only four diagnosis codes. The physician should selectfirst the reason for the encounter. In selecting the other three conditionsto report, the physician should attempt to select first those conditionsfor which procedure codes are listed and to which the procedures wheredirected.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Codes are to be used at their highest level of specificity, e.g.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Assign 3-digit codes only if there are no 4-digit codes within thatcode category,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Assign 4-digit codes only if there is no fifth digit subclassificationfor that category, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">_Assign the fifth digit subclassification code for those categorieswhere it exists.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">ICD-9-CM is composed of codes with either 3, 4, or 5 digits. Codeswith 3 digits are included in ICD-9-CM as stand alone codes or as the headingof a category of codes that are further subdivided by the use of fourthor fifth digits which provide greater specificity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Examples:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is assigned code 496, Chronicairway obstruction, not elsewhere classified. There are no fourth of fifthdigits for 496.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Acute myocardial infarction, 410, has fourth digits that describethe location of the infraction (e.g. 410.5 Of other inferior wall). Itwould be incorrect to report code category 410, without a fourth digit,when there are fourth digits provided. Also note that for this code categorythere is a fourth digit provided to use when the coder is not given informationabout the location of the infarction (410.9 Unspecified site).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Gastric ulcer, 531, has fourth digits assigned to provide informationsuch as whether there is hemorrhage or perforation. In addition the coderis instructed to assign a fifth digit (0 or 1) the describe whether ornot obstruction is mentioned. It would be incorrect to leave off the fifthdigit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Rupture of tendon, nontraumatic, 727.6, has fifth digits that provideinformation on the tendon which has ruptured. It would be incorrect toleave off the fifth digit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Claims submitted with 3 or 4 digit codes where 4 and 5 digit codesare available may be returned for proper coding. It is recognized thata specific diagnosis may not be known at the time of an initial officevisit. However, that is not an acceptable reason to submit a 3 digit codewhen 4 or 5 digits are more appropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Example:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A pediatric patient presents with blood in the urine (hematuria) andhigh blood pressure. The physician makes a diagnosis of acute glomerulonephritis.There is a 3 digit code for the category Acute glomerulonephritis (580),but it is further subdivided into fourth and fifth digits. A claim withthe diagnosis code 580 will not be accepted because more specificity isavailable and must be provided. For example, 580.0 is the code for acutepoststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. If, as often is the case with initialvisits, it is not certain whether the condition is poststreptococcal orassociated with a specified pathological lesion, then code 580.9, Acuteglomerulonephritis with unspecified pathological lesion in kidney, wouldbe appropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Do not code diagnoses documented as ``probable,'' ``suspected,''``questionable,'' or ``rule out'' as if they are established. Rather codethe condition(s) to the highest degree of certainty for that encounter/visit,such as symptoms, signs, abnormal test results, or other reason for thevisit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Physicians should be aware that this is contrary to the coding practicesused by hospital and medical record departments for coding the diagnosesof hospital inpatients. Hospital coding practices would lead to the codingof all discharge diagnoses listed as ``probable,'' ``suspected,'' ``questionable,''or ``rule out'' as if the condition existed. Further the coding of symptomsby medical record departments for inpatients is generally unacceptableparticularly when there is an established diagnosis. A requirement thatconditions listed as ``probable,'' ``suspected,'' ``questionable,'' or``rule out'' as if the condition existed would lead to significant over-countingof conditions. Therefore codes for symptoms and signs are appropriate andacceptable for physician reporting.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Example:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A neurologist evaluates a patient with complaints of dizziness anddouble vision. On physical examination, a visual field defect in noted.A diagnosis of ``rule out multiple sclerosis'' is made and the patientis referred for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multiple sclerosiswould not be coded as an established diagnosis. The physician should identifyone of the signs or symptoms as the reason for the encounter and may listothers as additional diagnoses if desired.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Note that the requirement for diagnosis coding applies only to theneurologist's bill or claim for payment. Ordering physicians are not requiredto include diagnosis codes on referral slips or requests for radiologicor other diagnostic tests. However, consistent with accepted medical practicesuch referral slips or requests should include a narrative descriptionof the reason for the test. In addition to assisting the radiologist, pathologist,or other physician in the proper performance and interpretation of therequested test, the information will assist the referring physician inthe completion of his/her bill or claim for payment. (See andplusmin;6 below).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In those instances where the physician does not document (identify)a definite diagnosis or problem at the conclusion of a patient care encounter/visit,the physician's office staff may select the documented chief complaints(s)as the reason for the encounter/visit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Example:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Patient is seen in the office with chief compliant of severe neckpain exacerbated by any movement. Pain appeared earlier in the day uponawakening from nap. No history of any injury or unaccustomed physical activity.The Physician's brief write-up stated normal finding on physical and neurologicalexamination, and the patient was instructed on immobility, heat, and analgesics.No diagnosis was documented. In this instance, code the chief complaintof neck pain, 723.1.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Chronic disease treated on an ongoing basis may be coded and reportedas many times as the patient receives treatment and care for the condition(s).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Example:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A patient is seen on a monthly basis for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,714.0. This diagnosis should be coded and reported at each visit regardlessof the number or frequency of visits.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. For patients receiving ancillary diagnostic services only duringan encounter/visit, the appropriate V code for the examination is sequencedfirst, and the diagnosis or problem for which the services are being performedis sequenced second.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This category will be used frequently by radiologists who are performingradiological examinations on referrals. V72.5, Radiological examination,not elsewhere classified will describe the reason for the encounter andwill be sequenced first on the bill. When the reason for the referral isfor other than a routine screening exam, a second diagnosis code shouldbe reported, e.g., wheezing, coughing.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Failure to list a second code in addition to V72.5 may lead to problemswith carrier screens on bill submittal. The code for Radiological examination,Not Elsewhere Classified (V72.5) includes referrals for routine chest x-rayswhich are not covered by Medicare. Carriers may establish screens to verifythat the referrals were not for routine chest x-rays. By supplying a secondcode to describe the reason for the referral, these bills can clearly beidentified as referrals to evaluate symptoms, signs, or diagnoses. Theomission of a second code may lead to requests from carriers for more informationprior to payment of the claim.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This category will also be used frequently by pathologists. V72.6,Laboratory examination, will describe the reason for the encounter (e.g.,study of biopsy specimen). If at the time of the bill submittal there isa diagnosis (e.g., malignant neoplasm) then an additional code can be submittedto describe the diagnosis.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Examples:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A physician refers a healthy, asymptomatic patient to a radiologistfor a routine chest x-ray as part of a routine physical examination. Theradiologist will code V72.5, Radiological examination, not elsewhere classified,as the reason for the visit.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A physician refers an ill patient to a radiologist for a chest x-raybut does not indicate the reason for the test. Use code V72.5, Radiologicalexamination, not elsewhere classified, as the reason for the visit. Sinceit is generally accepted medical practice to include the reason for thereferral on a referral note the internist's office should be contactedfor this information. The reason for the referral (e.g., chest pain (786.50),wheezing (786.09)) should then be coded and reported on the bill.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A physician refers a patient to a radiologist for a chest x-ray withthe reason for exam identified as cough and fever, rule out pneumonia.The x-ray is normal. The radiologist should code V72.5, Radiological examination,not elsewhere classified, as the reason for the visit. List an additionalcode or codes for cough (786.2) and/or fever (780.6, Pyrexia of unknownorigin) to describe the reason for the referral. Do not code ``rule outpneumonia'', as it is not an established condition.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A physician refers a patient to a radiologist for a chest x-ray withthe reason for exam identified as cough and fever, rule out pneumonia.The x-ray demonstrates bronchopneumonia. The radiologist should code V72.5,Radiological examination, not elsewhere classified, as the reason for thevisit. List an additional code for bronchopneumonia (485, Bronchopneumonia,organism unspecified). Do not code cough and fever, as more specific informationis available.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A physician refers a patient to a radiologist for a chest x-ray withthe reason for exam identified only as rule out pneumonia. The x-ray isnormal. The radiologist should code V72.5 as the reason for the visit.Do not code ``rule out pneumonia'' as if it exists. List an additionalcode for undiagnosed disease (799.9, Other unknown and unspecified cause).This code indicates that the patient has some condition, but it is notclearly defined.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. For patients receiving ancillary therapeutic services only duringan encounter/visit, the appropriate V code for the service is listed first,and the diagnosis or problem for which the services are being performedis listed second.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Example:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Use a code to describe rehabilitation services, V57.1, Other physicaltherapy, or V57.89, Other care involving use of rehabilitation proceduresfor a patient with multiple sclerosis, 340. Sequence the V code first,followed by the code for multiple sclerosis.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. For surgery, code the diagnosis for which the surgery was performed.If the postoperative diagnosis is known to be different from the preoperativediagnosis at the time the claim is filed, select the postoperative diagnosisfor coding.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. Code all documented conditions that coexist at the time of theencounter/visit, and that require or affect patient care treatment or management.Do not code conditions previously treated and no longer existing.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Physicians are advised to exercise care in coding (a) conditions presentlyexisting, (b) conditions no longer existing, (c) residuals (late effects)of conditions no longer existing, and (d) certain postoperative statusconditions that require consideration in the management of patient careand warrant coding. Some physicians will add to the list of conditionscurrently being treated any previous surgery or conditions that no longerexist to provide easy reference of patient's history for recapitulationin the ongoing care of the patient. These should not be coded unless theyrequire or affect patient case treatment or management.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Example:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The physician sees a patient for a follow-up visit for hypertensionand angina and prescribes a diuretic and nitroglycerin. The physician documentsbenign hypertension, angina, status post pneumonia (6 months ago), statuspost hysterectomy (6 years ago), and status post appendectomy (15 yearsago). In this instance, only two code assignments are made: hypertension(401.1, Essential hypertension, benign) and angina (413.9, Chronic ischemicheart disease, unspecified). The other conditions are not listed sincethey did not require or affect patient care.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-17122 Filed 7-20-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4120-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
