The combined-cycle systems investigated arecharacterized by having a wood-fueled combustor, an indirect-fired gasturbine, and a steam cycle. For this work, steady-state simulations ofthe various power plants were accomplished. The approach was to developa simulation code that would be general enough to readily allow changesin system configurations and components. This flexibility was to be inaddition to providing the usual capability for the parametric evaluationsexpected of most simulation codes. The resulting simulation program consistsof an executive program, subroutines for each component and subroutinesfor the supplemental information such as the property data. The executiveprogram provides for the coupling together of the various component subroutinesand the subsequent solution of the set of equations represented by theoverall system. The subroutines are models of the individual equipmentcomponents. They consist of mass and energy balances as well as performanceand sizing information. The results of the simulations allowed the varioussystems to be compared with regard to efficiency, power output, totalheat transfer area, and irreversibility.</TEXT></DOC>
