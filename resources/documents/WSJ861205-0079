The probe concerns the alleged purchase of LCP shares the day before Ward White announced its bid in October. Yesterday, David Rhead, LCP's chairman, said he requested an inquiry by the stock exchange, which confirmed that an investigation is under way.    In response, Ward White said in a statement that it &quot;believes the (investigation) is entirely irrelevant to the offer's commercial logic and financial benefits.&quot; Ward White and its merchant bank adviser, Morgan Grenfell andamp; Co., also said none of their employees or their families had separately purchased LCP shares prior to the bid.    In an earlier edition of The Wall Street Journal, Philip Birch, Ward White's chairman, said the announcement of his company's bid for LCP was accelerated after LCP's stock suddenly jumped on a single block trade. According to Mr. Birch, an unidentified party, acting after normal London trading hours, bought 25,000 shares of LCP at 8% above the previous trading price, as Mr. Birch was putting the final touches on the company's plans to acquire LCP.    The unusual trade, Mr. Birch said, convinced him that word of his intentions had leaked and prompted Ward White to accelerate disclosure of its plans to acquire LCP. However, he said he isn't certain that sudden speculation in LCP was the result of insider trading. LCP &quot;had been a fairly active (speculative takeover stock) for some time,&quot; he said.    Whatever the case, Ward White said in a statement that it &quot;recognizes current concerns about certain aspects of share trading and will fully support any stock exchange inquiry.&quot; However, a Ward White spokesman said: &quot;If LCP were suspicious of insider trading in their stock, then they should have gone to the stock exchange&quot; more than a month ago. &quot;It's assumed that LCP knew about the price moves in its stock prior to the bid.&quot;    The stock exchange investigation is the second this week into share price movement in British equities. On Monday, the Department of Trade said it is investigating &quot;circumstances suggesting misconduct&quot; at Guinness PLC, apparently dealing with the company's $3.6 billion takeover of Distillers Co.    Ward White operates over 1,000 stores in the United Kingdom and the U.S., including chains that are among Britain's largest retailers of toys, auto parts and do-it-yourself products. LCP's main operation is the Whitlock chain of automotive parts stores in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
