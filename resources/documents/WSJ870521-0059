The agreement, signed last night, tops a $72-a-share tender offer from New York investor Asher B. Edelman and Montreal-based Dominion Textile Inc. for Burlington, the nation's largest textile manufacturer.    For Morgan Stanley, the proposed acquisition represents the New York-based investment banking firm's largest leveraged buyout, far exceeding the $1.2 billion acquisition of Container Corp. of America that Morgan Stanley and Jefferson Smurfit Corp. completed last year.    The pact is likely to end a bitter monthlong battle by Mr. Edelman and Dominion to acquire Greensboro, N.C.-based Burlington. Sources close to the leveraged-buyout agreement said it includes breakup fees that will add to the cost of a higher bid for the company.    Burlington apparently ignored the Edelman-Dominion partnership's demand earlier this week that the company give the partnership the opportunity to top any competing bid for Burlington.    A man who answered the phone at Mr. Edelman's Manhattan home last night said that Mr. Edelman wouldn't be available to comment until today. Burlington officials couldn't be reached for comment.    The Edelman-Dominion partnership owns a 13.4% stake in Burlington and stands to make a profit of about $90 million if it sells its shares to the Morgan Stanley group.    Sources familiar with the agreement said that Burlington's management would participate in the leveraged buyout.    A leveraged buyout is financed largely by borrowing. The debt is generally repaid from the sale of assets or cash generated from operations. While one source said that it was likely that certain assets would be sold to help finance the transaction, it wasn't yet known which assets would be sold.    Some analysts had said that even at the $72-a-share price Mr. Edelman and Dominion offered for Burlington, the company would have to peel off a substantial amount of assets to pay the debt incurred in the buyout. Linda Morris, an analyst with Philadelphia's Provident National Bank, said recently that &quot;at this time you're looking at a breakup. (Burlington) is probably going to be a totally different company.&quot;    &quot;The irony is that Dominion may get a shot at buying the denim plants after all,&quot; said one source familiar with the leveraged-buyout transaction. Burlington's denim operations, which Dominion is said to have eyed, are considered one of the company's best assets. The denim plants &quot;would go for top dollar,&quot; said Dame Hamby, dean of the North Carolina State University School of Textiles.    Burlington shares closed yesterday at $72.25, off $1, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Burlington seemed poised to do whatever it had to to fend off Mr. Edelman and Dominion. There has been no love lost between either side, with the partnership and Burlington filing lawsuits against each other. The battle had also made its way to the North Carolina legislature and Capitol Hill as Burlington sought to line up support. And earlier this month, Burlington even threatened to gobble up Dominion to defend against the bid.    Early last month, after news reports surfaced that Mr. Edelman and Dominion had begun accumulating Burlington shares, the company lined up a weighty defense team. In addition to its traditional investment banker, Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., Burlington also hired First Boston Corp. to stave off a hostile bid.    Late last month, after Mr. Edelman and Dominion made their first offer to buy the company for $60 a share, Burlington's stock began to rise sharply and it became clear that the company would have to move quickly to enhance shareholder values.    Earlier this month, Burlington announced plans to buy as much as 30% of its stock for $80 a share. But after the Edelman-Dominion partnership boosted its bid for the company, it became clear that Burlington would have to find a buyer to keep from being taken over by the partnership.    As reported previously, the company talked with a number of leveraged buyout firms, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., Gibbons Green Van Amerongen and the leveraged buyout unit of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. While it is understood that other bids were received, none were as high as Morgan Stanley's.    If the transaction with Morgan Stanley is completed, First Boston and Kidder stand to earn a total of $13.5 million that will be divided between them. </TEXT></DOC>
