Japanese reaction wasswift, too -- but there the similarity ends.   The U.S. immediately deplored the coup and announced plansto cut off economic and military aid.</LP><TEXT>   Japan expressed &quot;surprise.&quot; Period.   Since then, the difference in approach has if anythingwidened. The Bush administration, following a U.S. law aimedat discouraging coups, has begun to wind down all aid toThailand, including projects already under way. Even thoughthe coup was bloodless and produced one of the most talentedThai cabinets in recent memory, the U.S. has made it clearthat ties between Bangkok and Washington won't really getback to normal until elections are held.   Japan, by contrast, has tended to view the coup as, atworst, a minor setback in Thailand's democratic development.Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's government did experiencemysterious &quot;administrative delays&quot; with a planned new aidpackage, but it continued to funnel aid funds already in thepipeline. Even the new package was finally un-delayed duringMr. Kaifu's recent visit to Bangkok -- a trip made whilemartial law was still in effect.   As the world's largest aid donor, Japan is increasinglythe country whose policies matter to aid recipients likeThailand. The Japanese give about $500 million a year ineconomic aid to Thailand. The U.S., which gives under $20million, has little leverage to exert.   If actions speak louder than words, Japan's soft-pedalingof the Thai coup may be a foretaste of what lies ahead asJapan begins fulfilling its oft-repeated vow to play a moreactive political role in Asia. As usual, Japan's top leadersaren't spelling out what they mean by the vow; Mr. Kaifu, ina self-styled major policy speech in Singapore during hisSoutheast Asian swing, contented himself with vaguegeneralities.   But that doesn't mean that Tokyo will continue to wait forWashington's lead, as it often has in the past. In thereaction to the Thai coup and in some of what Japan has beendoing recently vis-a-vis China and to some extent Cambodia, adistinctively Japanese approach is already evident. Growingeconomic power gives Japan the freedom to adopt its ownapproach; growing criticism from Japanese nationalists tiredof toeing the Washington line is putting pressure on Tokyo tofind its own way.   The new approach is still evolving and has yet to be fullyarticulated; in some cases the differences between theJapanese and American policy lines are subtle, and most ofthe instances don't involve matters the U.S. considers vital.But compared to American and to some extent Europeanpolicies, the emerging Japanese stance seems more flexible,more pragmatic, more concerned with peace and stability andregional prosperity and less with democracy and human rights.   In the past, despite numerous private disagreements, Japanpublicly deviated from the U.S. policy line mainly whennarrow economic interests were at stake. Tokyo, for example,has long tilted toward the Arabs despite Washington's strongsupport for Israel, but that tilt reflects Japan's near totaldependence on imported oil.   The new Japanese divergences are political. They're basedon a difference in world view rather than a narrowcalculation of economic interest. They reflect a growingemphasis on the Asian side of Japan's identity, as Mr. Kaifumade clear in his speech in Singapore. Noting that theproblems of peace and prosperity facing Asians and Europeansdiffer, he declared: &quot;It is thus up to us to find our ownways of doing things.&quot;   Policy toward China is a good example of these new ways.In the 1970s and '80s, as the U.S. itself warmed to China,Japanese and U.S. policies were more or less in harmony. Butin the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre, Japan isn'tdeferring. Japan did condemn the massacre, but concern withthe stability of its giant neighbor and a fear of isolatingChina soon overcame Japan's qualms about democracy and humanrights.   Thus, for most of the last two years, Japan has been aheadof other donor countries in urging a restoration ofinternational loans to China. Last November, Japan resumed afive-year, 810-billion-yen ($5.91 billion) loan package toChina.   Recently, allegations that China has been using prisonlabor to manufacture products for export and has been quietlyhelping Algeria build nuclear capabilities have souredAmerica's relations with China. Not Japan's.   The Thai coup is another clear example of divergence. Mr.Kaifu's Singapore speech didn't touch explicitly on the coup,but Mr. Kaifu had earlier in the trip made clear both Japan'ssupport for democracy in principle -- and its unwillingnessto base its policy on that principle. On the one hand, hesaid in response to a written question from this newspaperthat &quot;A change in government by a coup, wherever it may takeplace, does not comply with the principle of democracy and isregrettable.&quot;   On the other hand, by showing up in Bangkok at all heforcefully signaled Japan's unwillingness to dwell ondemocracy.   Japan's proponents say its flexibility allows it to lookbeneath the surface to the realities of situations like theThai coup. The previous Thai government, while democraticallyelected, was so openly corrupt that it would have been in aposition to buy the next election, the proponents say. Themilitary's intervention, they note, was widely popular.   When it comes to questions of democracy and human rights,says Hisahiko Okazaki, Japan's ambassador to Thailand, Japanis neither as dogmatic as the U.S. nor as nakedly unbound byprinciples as many other Asian countries, such as Thailanditself. &quot;Relations between nations is not a question of theform of government -- that's what the Thai people say,&quot; Mr.Okazaki notes. &quot;Our position is closer to the Thai position,somewhere between the U.S. and Thailand.&quot;   In Thailand, the military is one of several powerfulforces that vie for power, with no one of them completely orpermanently dominating, and this system of checks andbalances gives Thailand a kind of &quot;democracy,&quot; Mr. Okazakiargues.   In the Cambodian dispute, the differences between the U.S.and Japanese positions are more a matter of jockeying forposition than real substance. Both countries favor a phaseddisarmament of the conflicting Cambodian factions,culminating in free elections. The main difference is theextent of their eagerness for Japan to play a direct role inthe issue. Mr. Kaifu in Singapore, for example, offered tohost an international conference on Cambodian reconstructionsome time in the future.   But Ambassador Okazaki, for one, sees underlyingdifferences in nuance as well. Both Japan and Thailand, Mr.Okazaki says, are more willing than the U.S. to accept thereality that the Khmer Rouge, which killed millions when itheld power in the late 1970s, is &quot;one element of the powerbalance.&quot; In other words, he says: &quot;Western nations have thisabsolute moral inhibition. Japan and Thailand know that they{the Khmer Rouge} are terrible people, but we lack theinhibition.&quot;   For the foreseeable future, aid seems likely to continueto be Japan's major foreign-policy lever. And with that, aclash between U.S. and Japanese aid policies seems apparent.Such a clash could be embarrassing for the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
