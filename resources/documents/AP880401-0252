The spokesman, who spoke on condition he was not identified, didnot give the number. Sources at both the court and NicaraguanEmbassy cited World Court rules that forbid disclosure of writtenmaterial before hearings have been held in a case.   During 1985 hearings on a complaint about U.S. aid for theNicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, Sandinista officials speakingprivately put the damage at $250-$300 million.   A 1986 ruling by the court, a U.N. agency formally named theInternational Court of Justice, ordered the United States to haltall support to the Contras. The rebels began fighting in 1981, andlast week reached a preliminary cease-fire agreement with theSandinistas.   In the ruling, the 15-judge court also directed the parties tosettle the issue of reparations for damage caused by the rebels.The decision came after more than two years of proceedings on theNicaraguan complaint.   The Reagan administration boycotted the final 17 months ofproceedings, contending the court had no jurisdiction, and refusedto discuss the issue with the Sandinistas. The court began theaward procedure this year at Nicaragua's request.   It is expected to take several years. The next step is thefiling of written arguments by the United States, for which thecourt has set a July 28 deadline.   Sources familiar with the dispute said it was unlikely the U.S.government would be willing to enter the reparations argument afterhaving rejected the court's jurisdiction in 1984. The court has noenforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to itsrulings.   In a related development, Nicaragua withdrew a request for anemergency ruling on its case accusing Honduras of allowing theContras to have bases on Honduran territory.   That request was filed March 21, after the United States sent3,200 troops to Honduras in response to an alleged incursion byNicaraguan soldiers in pursuit of rebels.   In it, Nicaragua had asked the court to investigate allegedborder crossings by Honduran armed forces and requested that aninternational observer force monitor the border.   Nicaragua filed its action against Honduras last year. It hadbeen suspended on by request of both parties after five CentralAmerican presidents signed a regional peace plan Aug. 7.</TEXT></DOC>
