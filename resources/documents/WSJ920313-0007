L.L.P. shows the firms have taken advantage of a state lawdesigned to protect lawyers' personal assets from being usedto satisfy claims against their firms. The law, effectivelast Sept. 1, offers a shield to all Texas partnerships, butits inspiration came directly from suits filed against lawfirms by bank and thrift regulators.</LP><TEXT>   So far, Texas and Louisiana are the only states with lawsaimed at lessening lawyers' liability in malpractice casesarising from bank and thrift failures. But as regulators workharder to reach into law firms' deep pockets, such measuresmay become more common.   Unfortunately for most lawyers, the shields don't protectlawyers' past actions and could be overridden by federal law.Lawyers in both states who represent federal regulatorscontend the laws ultimately won't limit regulators' abilityto collect from lawyers. The new laws haven't yet been testedin court.   The Louisiana law, which also took effect Sept. 1,narrowly defines lawyers' and accountants' obligations aslimited to the financial institutions they represent. The lawwas prompted by regulators' efforts to pin professionaladvisers with an additional responsibility to the federaldeposit insurance funds -- meaning that lawyers andaccountants have to make sure their clients' actions don'tcause losses for the funds. Some banking lawyers saw this asa requirement that they tattle on clients.   The Louisiana law &quot;was designed to put some sanity backinto these lawsuits&quot; against bank and thrift advisers, saysDavid Willenzik, a New Orleans lawyer who helped draft it.The statute is intended to limit malpractice claims againstlawyers to actions that violate &quot;contemporary standards inthe community, not what federal regulators want them to be,&quot;he says.   But regulators aren't likely to play dead, says Victor RoyIII, a Baton Rouge, La., lawyer who represents the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp. Hesays the federal banking law that took effect in August 1989&quot;pre-empts state law on certain things,&quot; and lawyers' dutiesmay be among them; the courts will decide.   In Texas, changes in the state's partnership statutesenable law firms and other partnerships to protect thepersonal assets of members not involved in wrongdoingcommitted by other members of their firm. Before the changes,all partners were on the hook jointly.   For years, most states have offered law firms andindividual lawyers the chance to become professionalcorporations, gaining many liability protections. But suchcorporations carry tax burdens and reporting requirementsthat can make them unattractive. And their ability to shieldmembers from federal lawsuits is questionable.   The change in Texas was prompted by a rash of suitsagainst Texas law firms that had advised thrifts that laterfailed. One of the largest was against Jenkens andamp; Gilchristover advice given by a handful of partners. The Dallas firmsettled with regulators in 1989 for $20 million.   Steven D. Wolens, a Texas legislator who sponsored the newlaw, says it doesn't preclude suits against a firm, nor doesit shield lawyers who are uninvolved in wrongdoing fromhaving to contribute to settlements or judgments out ofcapital they've invested in the partnership. Only theirpersonal assets are shielded.   &quot;You can get the partnership assets -- the lawbooks, thecomputers,&quot; he says. But partners &quot;can't be required to giveup their Lexus.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
