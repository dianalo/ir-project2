Their protest came at the start of a critical week in whichPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev seeks parliamentary approval forstronger presidential powers.   Signs carried by some in the crowd of 1,500 people supportedEduard Shevardnadze, who resigned Thursday as foreign minister toprotest the growing influence of hard-liners and what he said was acoming dictatorship.   ``Shevardnadze is with us. Gorbachev is against us.Shevardnadze, stay with us!'' pleaded one sign, held aloft on abroken hockey stick.   Alexander Obolensky, a radical member of the Congress ofPeople's Deputies, said reformers such as Shevardnadze andAlexander N. Yakovlev have been forced into the background byhard-line Communists. Yakovlev retired in August from his post inthe Communist Party leadership.   ``Shevardnadze, trying to protect the intrigues of ourpresident, sacrificed desperately his political career,'' Obolenskysaid at the rally.   ``We want to ask you directly, Mikhail Sergeyevich,'' Obolenskysaid, addressing Gorbachev, ``you have pushed aside democrats, yousurrendered your faithful supporter, Yakovlev. You lostShevardnadze. Who are you going to be with?''   ``You are losing your allies,'' he said. ``Remember the fate ofKhrushchev, the reformer. Don't expect us to bow our headsobediently like in 1964!''   Khrushchev was ousted that year and replaced by Leonid I.Brezhnev, who reversed many reforms.   As the Congress begins the second week of its parliamentarysession Monday, it is expected to begin preliminary voting on theconstitutional amendments to strengthen Gorbachev's presidency.   Gorbachev wants direct control over a reorganized executivebranch of government to deal with a worsening economy and afragmenting union.   He also is expected to make changes in the leadership before theweek is out, including naming a vice president.   On Saturday, the deputies heard KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkovdeliver a speech that brought back some of the chill of the ColdWar.   Kryuchkov said the CIA is gathering information on workers'movements in the Soviet Union ``for its purposeful masterminding''and funding of ``anti-Soviet formations'' such as radio stationsthat attack the Soviet Union.   He also lashed out at pro-independence groups in the 15 Sovietrepublics, saying they have armed 26,000 fighters. He saidforeigners were trying to topple the Soviet government.   ``Today, if we undertake decisive actions to restore order, wehave to accept the fact that there could be bloodshed,'' Kryuchkovsaid.   Maria Denisenko, a radical member of the Russian legislature,attacked Kryuchkov's speech as ``tragic'' at a time when the UnitedStates and other Western nations were sending aid to the SovietUnion.   ``The KGB chief clearly showed us that he is going to defendsocialist gains, and he won't stop at anything, includingbloodshed,'' she said. ``If the moment comes, the whole nationshould rise up to defend democracy!''   The crowd in the small square opposite Moscow City Hall cheered.   Congress deputy and crusading magazine editor Vitaly Korotich,who did not address the rally, said in an interview thatKryuchkov's speech had little relevance.   ``I think that the KGB, of course, always needs an enemy. Ithink if the KGB collapsed, the CIA would die of starvation, andvice versa,'' Korotich said.   But Kryuchkov was not the only Soviet official talking tough onSaturday. Gorbachev issued a decree declaring that separatistactions by Turkish Christians and Russians in the southwesternrepublic of Moldavia were illegal.   In a presidential decree, he gave Moldavia 10 days to dissolve anew national guard and to reconsider a law that made Moldavian,which is similar to Romanian, the republic's official language.   On Sunday in Kishinev, the capital of Moldavia, a rally of``reconciliation'' organized by the Communist Party ended in abrawl after some people shouted at participants, ``Invaders, gohome!'' and tried to seize the microphones, the Tass news agencyreported.   Soviet television showed shoving matches in the crowd, and Tasssaid police intervened to restore order. Afterward, opponents ofthe rally marched to the local party headquarters and shoutedanti-Communist slogans, Tass said.   Moldavia, which borders Romania, has been hit by ethnic tensionduring its push for independence from the Soviet Union.   The Gagauz, a group of about 150,000 Turkish Christians,declared a new republic in southern Moldavia. In eastern Moldavia,more than 300,000 ethnic Russians and Ukrainians have declared anew republic along the Dniester River.</TEXT></DOC>
