Sofaer said in an interview withThe Associated Press.   But an aide to Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said that based ondiscussions Cranston has had with senators from both parties, heexpects ``there to be language in the ratification resolutionaddressing the treaty interpretation issues.''   Few people disagree over the meaning of the Intermediate-rangeNuclear Forces treaty signed at the U.S.-Soviet summit inWashington last December calling on the superpowers to destroytheir nuclear missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3,000 miles.   The heart of the dispute, rather, is interpretation of the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Sofaer is the author of the ``broadinterpretation'' of the ABM treaty which would allow wider testingof components of President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative,known as Star Wars.   Cranston's legislative aide, Gerry Warburg, said the languageexpected in the INF resolution ``would contain a more broadstatement concerning the intepretation of treaties generally,''including the ABM pact.   Cranston, along with Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of theSenate Armed Services Committee, and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., amember of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have beendiscussing the issue with Secretary of State George P. Shultz buthave not reached agreement, Warburg said.   Sofaer said inclusion of restrictive language in a resolutionratifying the INF treaty would not be binding on the Soviet Union,and could complicate rather than resolve the issue.   ``I know that they are not going to get a settlement of the ABMdispute this way,'' Sofaer said.   ``It is a potential problem for INF ratification, and I thinkoverwhelmingly people support INF ratification,'' he said.   Sofaer noted that Shultz had sent the Senate the 31-volumenegotiating record of the INF pact and also had agreed that anytestimony by administration officials would be ``authoritative''and reflect the president's understanding of the treaty.   ``Those practical things have been achieved,'' Sofaer said.   While the Senate can bind the administration to a particularinterpretation of either the INF or the ABM treaties, he said, itcannot bind the Soviet Union, unless the treaties are renegotiated.   ``The treaty reflects two relationships,'' he said. ``Itreflects a relationship between two sovereign nations, and then italso reflects the relations betwen the United States executivebranch and the Senate.''   ``When you talk about the meaning of a treaty, you are talkingabout the international relationship. You are talking about whatbinds the two nations,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
