AMD and Intel have beenengaged in arbitration hearings over the 80386 since 1987.andP;  In1989, an arbitrator ruled that Intel was liable for damagesbecause the company had breached a portion of its second-sourceagreement with AMD for the iAPX86 devices.andP;  Because part of theiAPX86 agreement gave AMD rights to Intel patents, areverse-engineered 80386 would be legal if it did not violateIntel's mask works, which refers to the physical layout of thecircuit.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
